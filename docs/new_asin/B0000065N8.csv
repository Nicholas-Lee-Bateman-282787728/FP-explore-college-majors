1190716,5,B0000065N8,"There always seems to be this inescapable stigma attached to films that slip-stream their way to success (or notoriety) behind the mainstream glory of a film that paved the way for it's genre. A film's individual merits always seem to pale against the easiest most obvious comment of 'jumping on the bandwagon'. The Burning is definitely one of those films that is worth far greater attention and praise than a quick once over, and the conclusion of 'just another Friday the 13th clone'.
5 years previously at Camp Blackfoot, a practical joke orchestrated by a small group of kids on their notoriously cruel caretaker named 'Cropsy' goes badly wrong. The result leaves him horrifically burnt, and enduring years of hospital treatment to restore even the vaguest quality of life. Soon after the final attempt at a skin graft operation fails, he is released back into the world where an encounter with a prostitute forces him to confront the extent of his disfigurement, and he's pushed over the edge. Now hell-bent on revenge, he returns once more to Camp Blackfoot where he has now ascended into folklore and brings the camp-side scare stories to bloody life as he begins dispatching the counsellors and the typically conformist/non-conformist group of young teenagers one by one with a pair of garden sheers.. The Burning's inspiration is obvious, but it's execution is far less so. Through the ealiest section of the film we are given a brutal taste of Cropsy's rage and then left purely at the mercy of Maylam's voyeuristic, unsettling direction and the devilish games-playing that manipulates audience anticipation at every turn. In many ways it feeds off it's genre and it's predecessors superbly to keep the audience unsettled and on edge until it unleashes on them with an inventive and shocking brutality, courtesy of effects maestro Tom Savini. Rick Wakeman provides the jarring yet effective score that accompanies the mayhem.
Yes, The Burning is an eighties horror flick. If you've come here to watch a cool, hip, glossy, self satirising moneyspinner full of unblemished young stars and 'it' people - then you're in the wrong place. This is a classic movie from the heyday of horror when a 'horror' film tag meant 'you will be horrified'. If you accept the limitations of the slasher flick, then it really is hard to fault this film - it's not exploitative, nor is it over the top, it's a film that genuinely boasts some great direction, superb effects, and truly unsettling and memorable scenes. Originally released in 1981 and later on video prior to the video recordings act in the UK, The Burning was withdrawn over here after it made it on the 'video nasties' list issued by the BBFC in 1984. It then attained a certain notoriety after it was the subject of some distributor prosecutions and officially banned. If you're in any way interested in horror films, then this is one that will take pride of place in your collection, so buy it while you can!!",996019200,2,2968,4.90258449304175

1190723,4,B0000065N8,"I remember first seeing this movie when I was about 5 and beingso scared it gave me nightmares. Do not take this lightly. I had beenwatching horror films since I was 2 and no horror film had reallyscared me until I saw this one. Anyway, I saw it again recently and itwas still pretty scary. It may be considered a ""Friday the13th"" rip-off, but I personally thought it was on par with theFriday the 13th series
The killer in ""The Burning"" wasincredibly creepy because he is never really seen, other than thefirst and last five minutes of the movie. You are left with yourimagination to visualize how horribly disfigured this man has becomefrom the cruel prank played on him. And unlike the murder of almostevery other horror film, Cropsy isn't afraid to take his anger out onanyone, adult or child.
Remembering this film, I am reminded of oneparticular scene which has been mentioned several times. THE RAFTSCENE. No other horror movie (to my memory) has ever had the guts topull off what was done here. This scene is still implanted in my mindand will no doubt go down in horror movie history.
Another attributewhich makes this movie completely frightening is the haunting score. Istill hear those haunting keyboards playing in my occasionalnightmares. Creepy.
Creepy atmosphere, haunting score, and actingjust cheesy enough to work make this a memorable 80s slasher. Totallyunderrated and a must-see for any horror connoisseur. Also try Madman,which was another movie based on the ""Cropsy Legends.""",982627200,7,1499,5.048387096774194

1190759,3,B0000065N8,"I've re-visited this film quite a few times over the years, and while I enjoy it overall, there just seems to be something missing. I'm a huge fan of 80's horror, and slasher films in particular. ""The Burning"" has a great horror pedigree, with F/X by gore guru Tom Savini, and young Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter stashed in the cast, and phenomenal score by ""YES"" keyboardist Rick Wakeman.

As the film opens we see a group of young campers planning a scheme to scare the hell out of the nasty camp caretaker known as Cropsey. Sleeping off a drunken stuper in his cabin, the young campers plan on using a prop, candlelit skull to exact their revenge on the cranky old man. Something goes horribly wrong with the prank with Cropsey getting severely burned.

Flash forward a few years, and Cropsey is back on the streets after a lengthy hospital stay, and it seems he's heading straight back to his old camp ground in order to work out his revenge issues with the current crop of teens camping downstream. Using his super sharp hedge clippers, the body count begins.

I think there are a few reasons why ""The Burning"" doesn't quite hit the highest notes of a good ""Friday the 13th"" film. The best part of the 80's slash fests are the inventive kills. Fans of the genre will know who is going to survive within the first five minutes, and the fun comes in the stalk and kill with these movies. Unfortunately for Cropsey he's limited to only using hedge clippers over and over. And while Savini's handiwork is clearly shown, it gets pretty repetitive and somewhat dull seeing basically the same kill over 90 minutes. Cropsey is hidden in shadows most of the film too which doesn't really help. There's no personality to Cropsey which really hurts this kind of movie.

On the plus side, unlike other genre standards, we do get to know the campers a bit. They manage to actually flesh out some characters, so that we have some small investment in the characters when they face off against Cropsey. It's not much, but it's something.

The highlight of the film for me is Wakeman's score. It's the one takeaway from the film that makes this entry in the slasher genre stand out above the others in the bargain bin.",1465344000,,2209,4.582278481012659

He decides to go on a massacre and kill some campers. The only real problem with the plot is he gets revenge on people who did nothing to him. And some plot holes like the raft massacre for example was he just sitting in the raft for hours hoping they show up. Idk but whatever I try not to over think somethings. The raft massacre was the best part of the movie honestly as kills go because you get 5 kills instead of just 1. Over all it's a must watch just don't take it to seriously.,1459641600,,625,4.048387096774194

1190764,3,B0000065N8,"The Burning is another infamous slasher of the early 80s mostly because of Tom Savinis graphic gore effects and the problems his work caused the film when it was released. Its release was also limited, even in the US and thus the film, especially uncut, became sought after by the horror/gore crowd. The film is also renown for being the first appearances of Holly Hunter, Jason Alexander and Fisher Stevens before they all went on to find fame in there perspective careers and, it was one of the Weinsteins first productions as Mirimax Pictures as well, before going on to become two of the biggest producers and one of the biggest companies in the business. But does it stand up to its reputation? Yes and no.

The Burning starts out in 1976 at Camp Blackfoot where, in slasher era tradition, a group of campers are plotting to pull a prank on the mean and creepy caretaker named Cropsey. The prank goes terribly wrong and Cropsey is burned horribly and hospitalized. We then jump forward to 1981 where the deformed Cropsey is released from the hospital and now dressed completely in black, goes and finds a prostitute whom he promptly butchers when she becomes frightened upon seeing his face. We then arrive at Camp Stonewater which is across the lake from Camp Blackfoot which was closed after the accident. We see that a figure dressed in black is stalking the campground carrying a pair of garden shears wonder who that could be? Before you can say Jason Voorhees the black clad figure is slaughtering the nubile young campers in quite gruesome fashion with his sharp garden tool. Has Cropsey returned to exact revenge for the prank gone awry and will any of the unsuspecting campers survive?

As directed by Tony Maylam, this notorious slasher flick is actually very by the numbers and very slow paced. After Cropsey kills the hooker, its almost 40 minutes before he strikes again and the film is only 90 minutes long. There is a lot of time spent with our various campers and councilors, which would be fine on a character development level if any of them were all that interesting. The characters are all fairly generic, the bully Glazer (Larry Joshua most recognized as the sleazy wrestling event promoter in Sam Raimis Spider-Man), the harried nerd Alfred (Brian Backer), the wise-ass David (Jason Alexander) and the good looking counselors (Brian Matthews and Leah Aryes) who are in a relationship and too busy to notice campers are disappearing in droves till it is too late. The time spent with them before the killing starts is for the routine camp movie hi-jinx and doesnt really help to endear us to any of them. Once Cropsey goes into kill mode with his trusty shears, its still fairly by the numbers and its up to make-up FX master Savini to do in young campers in gruesomely effective fashion. Most notable is a sequence on a raft where Crospey takes out half the campers in a few deft swings and chops of his favorite weapon. Its a good scene and one that this film is famous for. And Savini earned his paycheck and reputation as the gore FX are top notch. There is some atmosphere though, some of that is due to Rick Wakemans spooky score. The film deviates from the slasher formula a little and seems to focus on Alfred giving us a final boy this time instead of the usual female who fights back, though he is not the only survivor so, even this classification is thin.

The cast are pretty wooden for the most part, though Alexander does give us a glimpse of what made him famous  almost a decade later on Seinfeld. Backer is fine as Alfred but, he is a textbook 80s movie nerd, a role he would play to perfection in the classic Fast Times At Ridgemont High a year later. As for Ayres and Matthews, they make an attractive couple and are fine as the leads but, they never really rise above their stereotype parts. The rest are just killer fodder and/or there to show their boobs.

So, in conclusion, Tom Savinis excellent work and the novelty of first time appearances by actors who would become famous aside, The Burning is a slow moving and paced slasher that follows the formula only to deviate slightly with the sex of its focal character though, to be honest, the film never really focuses on a lead character till the last act. That and it robs us of an element of mystery and a big reveal by having our killers identity known from the very start. As films of this era go, its worth checking out and does have some 80s nostalgia added to it now, but doesnt quite live up to its reputation, as much as, solidifies Savinis. Worth a look for Savinis contributions and to amuse ones self at some of the acting debuts but, its not one of the strongest representations of its era. Include it as part of a double feature of other like horrors and you can have some nostalgic fun with it along with your other flicks of choice.",1454112000,2,4850,4.576524741081703

1190772,5,B0000065N8,"The movie starts with a group of kids at a camp called Camp Blackfoot, who are totally fed up with the abuse they have taken from a cross, drunken summer camp caretaker named Cropsey.  The kids only intention was to scare Cropsey by pulling a prank on him.  The prank goes terribly awry and causes an accidental fire that burns and disfigures Cropsey.  After five years at St. Catherine's Hospital Cropsy is released.  Next we meet the kids and counselors of Camp Stonewater.  While Cropsey hides in the woods looking for an opportunity to strike, the teen kids watch and play baseball.  We soon meet beautiful Sally who is the girlfriend of the camp bully Glazer.  We also meet Alfred who has a crush on Sally and possessive Glazer threatens and bullies Alfred several times over it.  We also meet Alfred's prankster friends, Fish, Woodstock(Fisher Stevens, Hackers, Only You, My Science Project, Tv's Key West) and Dave(Tv's Duckman and Tv's Seinfeld).  They all like to do things to make a fool out of Glazer.  We also meet sensitive and likable camp counselor Todd and his beautiful and hot partner and girlfriend Michelle.  At the campfire Todd tells everyone a slightly exaggerated story about Cropsy. He fills them in on the plot from earlier, mentions his weapon of chioce being garden shears, and he exaggerates all the rest.  Todd scares the teen kids by having one named Eddy dress up as Cropsy.  During all of this Cropsey is ready to strike when they least expect.  It's all just a question of when.

This movie was directed by Tony Maylan.  It was produced by Harvey Weinstein.  It was edited by Jack Sholder(director of the Hidden).  The gore was brilliantly done by none other than Tom ""Sex Machine"" Savini. Finally the musical score was done by Rick Wakeman of the band Yes.

The cinematography by Harvey Harrison was beautiful and well shot.  The editing by Jack Sholder was very well cut and concise.  Tom Savini's good was(as always) beautifully done, very realistic and believable, and in general brilliant.  After coming up with some excellent gore for Dawn of the Dead(1978), Maniac(1980), and Friday the 13th(1980) his competency with gore effects had been abundantly proven.  Rick Wake did some great music for the score.  The emotions of levity, mystery, and fear showed well in his music.  The acting was even very believable, not corny at all, and quite professional for a slasher.  It was interesting to see Jason Alexander in his film debut and get this with a full head of hair, seeing a much younger Fisher Stevens long before Key West, and as for lovely, sexy, and multi-talented Holly Hunter well I just plain couldn't find her anywhere in this movie.  I don't think that she got much camera time.

There wasn't much nudity but it wasn't bad what you got.  There were definitely quite a few really real scream queens in this though.

The first person camera perspectives were a great touch and I have never seen them done like this in any other movie.  That was one very unique approach to it.  The camera work and the edits showing the detail(s) of any of the scenes was beautifully done.

It was nice to see some fun light-heated levity in the movie, such as the canoe scene where they all splash eachother.

Cropsey proved equally menacing while hiding, stalking, and murdering.  As far as the kill scenes go, it's less about the variety in his killing style and more about his intensity, vicious hardcore style, and the gore effects that follow.  In general, he's menacing, shrewd, and you just never know when he'll strike.

Overall, if you're into great slashers from the 70's and 80's, like well designed and executed gore, like to look at attractive people, want to see exceptionally good acting in a slasher, like campy scenes, and especially are into such great slashers of that era such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974), Black Christmas(1974), Halloween(1978), Friday the 13th(1980), or even A Nightmare on Elm Street, than this 1981 classic is for you.

Please Note: Though this might seem like a Friday the 13th rip-off it's actually different both plot-wise and tone-wise.",1446163200,,4120,4.824536376604851

It might come of like a cheap carbon copy of Jason and the Friday the 13th series but, it's really not
The film was put  on UK's video nasties list mostly due to the epic insane bloodbath  raft scene and banned in the UK!
It's a unique take on the Cropsy legend  this slasher kills everyone he comes across Nurses, Hookers and plenty of young campers

The Cast is average at best
most of the cast is young you can't blame them every character is somewhat one dimensional
This is also the film debuts of
Jason Alexander  (Seinfeld fame)
Fisher Stevens,
and Holly Hunter. (Holly's debut is short blink and your miss her)
Brian Backer as Alfred is somewhat of a interesting character mostly cause he's used as a miss direct (Brain is best known for being in Fast Times at Ridgemont High

The biggest selling point of this film is the kills  Tom Savini did the F/X so you know it'll be a beautiful bloodbath
all the gore is practical and still to this day very effective the way everything is edited and cut in some areas fast enough that it hides the movie magic
You can't talk about the Burning without talking about the infamous raft massacre
It's one of the most brutal scenes in any american horror movie everything about it is just flawless the timing the build-up, (This is how to do a hardcore NC-17 bloodbath)
A scene like this would never be shown in any theater! It's not politically correct it's disturbing and still to this day shocking....

1190813,3,B0000065N8,"I ordered THE BURNING, based on a fuzzy memory of seeing and liking it. Well, after seeing it again, I really don't understand the praise heaped on this movie. Sure, it isn't the worst slasher movie I've seen. Some of the effects hold up okay, but most don't. Makeup artist Tom Savini has done much better work, including FRIDAY THE 13TH. Speaking of that particular movie, it still stands head and shoulders above THE BURNING, in acting and direction. We all know not much ""acting"" is required in a teens-getting-hacked-up flick. However, with the exception of a few recognizable future stars, it's bad here. Even the much talked about ""Raft Scene"" comes off a bit laughable. In general, the ""terrified"" reactions range from wooden, to ridiculously over the top. Also, the cast isn't particularly attractive, compared to the babes in the FRIDAY THE 13TH flicks. This makes the required genre nudity less effective. I know it sounds sexist, but this is a big part of the appeal of teen slasher movies from the era. I'm only referencing FT13, because it is the most obvious comparison. I know people love this movie, and I'm not going to knock anyone's taste. Personally, I just don't see the appeal.",1413504000,,1199,4.825242718446602
1190824,4,B0000065N8,"In Camp Blackfoot a group of boys get together to pull a prank on the site caretaker by the name of Cropsy (Lou David), whom according to them was a worthless bullying man. The prank goes wrong and they end up burning him alive leaving his body completely roasted. Five years later he's released from the hospital and he makes his way back to the same place with a new camp across from it called Camp Stonewater.-summary

The Burning is a slasher film that was released back in 1981 at a time the slasher had really begun to pick up some steam. In fact, it's among the Friday the 13th clones that follows a brutal killer tormenting kids and counselors at a summer camp. Regarded as a cult classic, the film more than likely fell into obscurity due to the success of the later slasher flick A Nightmare On Elm Street, along with its sequels and the Friday the 13th sequels. Frankly, as much as I enjoy the movie, I'm glad it disappeared because looking back I don't think the horror genre needed another indestructible killer. I think it would have actually hurt the original in the long run by turning Cropsy into another joke of a villain.

Directed by Tony Maylam, The Burning is among the better slashers of the 80's. It followed the usual formula even back then, yet at the same time there were certain elements it abandoned that feels quite refreshing in retrospect. I really didn't notice a lot of these things back then, so I'll leave those for new viewers to notice.

When it comes down to my horror movies, I'm usually a sucker for good stories and at least decent plots. In The Burning's case though, I have to give it up immediately to Tom Savini's Italian giallo influenced special effects concerning gore. The death scenes may feel dated since everything is done in CG these days, but you'll be surprised how these vicious kills puts the newer stuff to shame. Cropsy uses as a weapon a set of gardening shears, and good grief, the mayhem; slashed and stabbed throats are done very well with the meat appearing to be stretched to oblivion. Cropsy clearly means business, as one scene especially not only defines cruelty, but it also manages to capitalize on the heavy atmosphere set by Maylam's direction. It's clear that these kids are up against a ruthless force, with no real way of escape as if they were fated to die in the woods completely alone and helpless. This is one movie I can continue to watch and the setting still provides an uneasy feel for me when things get going.

The first half of the movie attempts to get the viewer attached to most of the cast, such as the misunderstood Alfred (Brian Backer), the bully Glazer (Larry Joshua), and the pretty, almost innocent looking Sally (Carrick Glenn), which gives off this rather slow feel that will have the gore and butcher hounds wondering is there any blood-slurping action at all. But give it some time though, and you will be treated to several violent altercations as the woods becomes the final resting place for a good portion of these folks. I enjoy how the tension is pretty much right in your face; the movie lightly relies on cheap scares, when it's time for someone to go there's no question if it's going to happen. Another aspect of the movie that stands out to me is the development of Cropsy. He's one of the more sympathetic villains, because he has a reason to be thirsting for blood; he was indeed pushed pass his breaking point, and whoever he use to be was long gone, with all being left is unrestrained rage and hatred for everyone, which can be seen in his actions. The only real flaw I can see with this movie is that Cropsy's background was never explored. The viewer will learn that Cropsy was supposedly a bad man, but you're given no details outside of just pure talk. This really doesn't work... you're suppose to have reasons to hate the villain. Yet you may find yourself cheering for him in a way because he comes off as the victim seeking revenge. This is my main problem since his reputation of a jerk is from the perspective of quite possibly bad boys. This portion really needed some insight.

The acting was pretty much in the middle with me for the most part. Backer and Joshua were the most entertaining for me, especially Joshua, I enjoyed him as the bully and some of his dialog still has me laughing today. But when the acting is bad it can be quite bad.

The Burning is a way above average slasher; it has a good kill count, excellent gore, 80's hot chicks giving us some T&A and even frontal nudity. Plus there's male booties for those who seem to like that. Overall, it's something that has been living in my collection for years, and I believe it will satisfy most gore hounds. Recommended.

Pros: Great gore effects with a great killer

Cons: Somewhat slow first half, no background on killer",1412553600,,4816,4.546712802768166

1190833,5,B0000065N8,"SHOUT! releasing is causing me to give five star reviews to what might otherwise only be two or three star films in themselves. However, in the case of ""The Burning"", I actually enjoyed it. It is conceived with a bit more intelligence than the brain basher that remains ""Friday the 13th"", but really no one should be comparing these two titles. ""The Burning"" is a movie that can stand up on its own. Much has been written on the intensity of its violent scenes, but really they are nothing short of effective. ""The Burning"" shows strong signs that some elements of creativity went into it, plus the film was beautifully shot and remains an item of visual interest among movie lovers. It has the same outdoors, natural scenery that infested 1982's ""Swamp Thing"", and sometimes both of these feel similar in a way (at least to me). I miss the days of eighties horror, when comic book-style plots didn't have to come with the same level of self-consciousness that they do today (when it's just not accepted for one to make a silly story and be proud of it, much less try to sell it in a serious fashion--oh I miss those days). There's not much more to say about the acting, the writing, or the music, other than to reiterate that I enjoyed this one for the most part.
The SHOUT! release is nothing short of splendiferous, and the TLC handling of this spectacular exploitation movie is superbly realized by the production team. It's about time that someone realized the value in these old titles and began to preserve and distribute them for us nerds. The picture and sound on the set is superb. It is almost as if SHOUT! is creating a new film package every time they set out to remaster an older title--simply amazing work. The interview with Savini is priceless good fun to listen to. The interview with Cropsy is also amusing. I really enjoy the audio commentary tracks--yes, there are two of them, both fun. No complaints from me on the widescreen picture and the sound presentation. I don't like all slasher movies out there, but this one is definitely a keeper, with many creepy moments, many great gore effects shots, and plenty of, believe it or not, suspense. My reviews on this site take into consideration the quality of the product being sold (the item that I am reviewing) AS WELL as the content that makes up the movie experience (what I call the ""movieness"") of the film itself, and I try to weigh both the scores evenly before doing the grading.

1190847,5,B0000065N8,"From Friday the 13th to Sleepaway Camp, Camp Slashers seemed to be a horror genre favorite in the 80s. The Burning would join the list and it definitely does not disappoint in the least as it delivers in all aspects. In a way this movie has similar mannerisms to Friday the 13th.

The film opens with a flashback to a Summer of 1976 at Camp Blackfoot where several campers are about to pull a prank on sleeping caretaker, Cropsy. Cropsy was said to be a sadistic, alcoholic caretaker who got pleasure from hurting other campers. After picking on a particular camper too much, he gathered his friends and decided to prank him. One night, they quietly sneak into his cabin and put a worm infested skull next to his bed that is lit with candles in the eye sockets. When Cropsy awakens to the campers banging on his window, he's so frightened by the skull, he accidentally knocks it into the bed with him, catching him on fire. Cropsy accidentally knocks over a gas can, causing the flames to spread around the cabin. Cropsy flees from the cabin and stumbles down a hill, where he falls into a river.

Years later, Cropsy is released from the hospital and is dressed down in a long trench coat, a hat, gloves, and sunglasses. After he's released, a hooker brings him to her place and prepares herself to have sex with him. But once she sees his burned face (extra crispy), he becomes angry and kills her in a bitter rage. The monstrous Cropsy then makes his way back to his stomping grounds. A group of campers end up going on a canoe trip and unfortunately for them, their destination is just mere feet away from the burned down cabin of Cropsy. When Cropsy becomes aware that campers have invaded his home, he sees this as a golden opportunity to begin a vengeful and bloody murder spree.

Honestly, I'd put The Burning right next to Friday the 13th as being a prodigious 80s slasher. As I said at the beginning of the review, this movie seems to follow a lot of mannerisms of Friday the 13th but I believe that the death scenes in The Burning are more gruesome and bloody than Jason Voorhees slashing away campers with his trusty machete. Trust me, some of these kills will you have you cringing. I wish that there had been a sequel made for this movie but sadly there wasn't. There was a poster made for The Burning 2 by the Strange Kids Club, giving their vision on what they think the poster would've looked like, had their been a sequel. The poster is really neat and hopefully somewhere down the line, a sequel is given. But overall The Burning is a true gem to come from the 1980s and I recommend this over any ""horror"" movies that are released in theaters nowadays.",1390694400,,2671,4.469262295081967
1190848,2,B0000065N8,"Judging by the recent high praises this film has received from the fans, I was expecting some forgotten, neglected masterwork of horror but in reality, this is a terribly messy film from a technical standpoint and there is no denying there are better efforts in the genre for my tastes. It follows the typical formula, with several young imbeciles being slaughtered in graphic ways and the occasional gratuitous nudity is thrown in just because ... it's an early 80's slasher flick. The cast is interesting as it has some well known actors in their first roles - Jason Alexander (with hair), Holly Hunter (blink and you might miss her) and Fisher Stevens.

The story deals with a vicious prank that goes horribly wrong and its victim, a camp caretaker named Cropsy, is horribly burned to the point of disfigurement. Years later, after unsuccessful skin grafts and surgeries, Cropsy, who is now filled with rage and vengeance and armed with sharp garden sheers, is released from the hospital and decides to unleash his fury on a group of clue-less councilors and the obnoxious, unsuspecting teens at a nearby summer camp.

The film is very similar to ""Friday the 13th"" in tone and the gore effects were done by the legendary Tom Savini. Although I am a fan of Savini and applaud his work in other films such as ""The Prowler"", ""Day of the Dead"" and ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"", I found his work here very uneven. At times, he delivered the goods but there are moments when the gore effects fail miserably. For instance, the infamous raft sequence (a scene I found a bit ridiculous, sorry) where the effects range from great to no-so-great (the stabbing of the neck is pretty cheesy) and when the elusive, murderous Cropsy is finally unmasked, he simply looks like he's wearing a hideous rubber mask purchased at the neighborhood dollar store. I would have been more forgiving of the bad make-up or mask had this been filmed in the 50's, but even by 1981 standards, it is a poor job. The editing is also grating at times and is especially sloppy during the fiery finale.

I respect its following, but I, unfortunately, have no love for this movie. It is shoddily directed and edited and yes, I know you have to suspend your disbelief but I still had trouble accepting the actions of some of the idiots in this film. It is gory but the effects do not always work and with far too many immature, obnoxious characters to give a darn, ""The Burning"" will remain in the shadows of its greater cousins. Oh, and did I mention, it's forgettable? I guess I went into this expecting far better when in reality it is no better than the many others of its period.",1389139200,,2656,4.646808510638298

This one just happens to be one of the best.  Yes, it does feature a setting oft-used in slasher films: summer camp.  But seriously, where else can you ambush a group of kids, far from safety, if not in a wilderness setting?  With plenty of trees and bushes to hide behind, canoes to jump out of, and ruins to stalk through, this film favors one fabulous hunting ground.  Thankfully, there are scores of bodies (I meant kids) to provide fodder for the dark attired villain of this piece: Cropsey!  Naturally, they will wander off on their own and suffer the consequences (hard lessons learned, stick with you the longest).  In this case, the expiration date is sooner than you think.  In a surprising turn, only one of the kids present proves obnoxious enough that you want to see him killed, sooner the better.  The rest are just a bunch of happy go lucky knuckleheads out for a good time.
I love that a great deal of the `horror' takes place in the daytime or in well lit areas, this is rare for these types of films.  It helps that the `gore' in this piece is well designed by Tom Savini, who obviously wanted it featured.  Everything else runs second to his art.

1190917,4,B0000065N8,"I believe I've found what must be the seminal summer camp slasher film of the 1980s. It captures every element of the decade's obsession with movies like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Meatballs"" and puts them in one package. Shout! Factory has scored again with their Blu-ray release of ""The Burning.""

The caretaker of a summer camp is burned alive and left deformed after a prank goes wrong. Years later, he's released from the hospital and returns to the area where the accident occurred. A new group of campers have arrived for the summer and he has horrific plans for them. Hedge clippers in hand, the caretaker begins his reign of terror on the counselors and attendees.

""The Burning"" has the raunchy toilet humor of ""Meatballs"" mixed with everything you came to expect from slasher films like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Sleepaway Camp."" You have nice girls making bad decisions by hooking up with bad guys. Unfortunately, the killer sees all and punishes them for their perverse deeds.

I always thought the killer in ""Friday the 13th, Part V: A New Beginning"" was the first to utilize hedge clippers. I was very wrong, as you can see in ""The Burning."" It's obvious the psycho in ""A New Beginning"" took inspiration from the crazy caretaker.

It's unbelievable how many big names are attached to ""The Burning."" Harvey Weinstein created and co-wrote the story. Bob Weinstein co-wrote the screenplay. Special Make-up Artist Tom Savini returns to camp for a second time after his classic work on ""Friday the 13th."" His handiwork keeps the blood flowing efficiently.

Brian Backer plays a character more annoying than the one he did in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" Jason Alexander (yes, George Costanza) portrays a sporty and popular high schooler. He has a full head of hair and doesn't wear glasses. Holly Hunter can be seen briefly as a camper. She looks like she was maybe 13 years old.

The high definition transfer for ""The Burning"" is another great example of Shout! Factory's dedication to preserving these classic horror films in the best format available at the time. The picture is clean without losing any of the movie's original grit. The audio perfectly delivers all the sounds of the outdoors, dialogue, and horrifying screams you'd expect from a slasher flick set at a summer camp.

As we've come to expect, Shout! Factory has packed this Collector's Edition with exciting bonus material. Director Tony Maylam and Journalist Alan Jones provide audio commentary for the film. There are a few interviews with the actors and crew as well. A featurette entitled ""Blood 'N' Fire Memories"" is featured. A theatrical trailer, behind-the-scenes footage, a make-up effects still gallery, poster and still gallery, and the original screenplay are also included.

""The Burning"" is another one of those cult classics many people forget about in the shadow of ""Friday the 13th."" If you're a fan of 1980s slasher movies, it's a must-own. Consumers will be happy with its amount of extra features coupled with a high definition film transfer that promises viewers a positive experience.",1368057600,5,3082,4.994152046783626
1190918,4,B0000065N8,"This was a great, campy, classic slasher movie which served as a teen, sex-driven comedy when blood wasn't being spilled.  I highly recommend it.

An 80s slasher-horror that takes place at a summer camp.  Yeah, I think I've seen it before--Sleepaway Camp (1983, and three sequels plus a ""fake"" sequel), Friday the 13th (1980, plus nine sequels, a Freddy crossover and a remake).  But don't skip this with that notion in mind.

In many of these movies the killer is ""made"" by the mistreatment of campers; Angela was teased before killing the campers and staff at Sleepaway Camp, Jason Voorhees drowned while over-sexed lifeguards were smoking pot and making out at Crystal Lake.  Our killer is made when a prank goes terribly wrong.  Some teens thought it would be funny to scare the camp caretaker by placing a burning skull next to his bed for him to wake up to.  When he awakens, shocked, he knocks over the skull which catches his bed (and him) on fire and he's horribly burned--hence the title.

After five years of treatment and skin grafts he is released from the hospital.  This is a rather elaborate treatment considering that when we see his face in the end, it looks like someone just dumped water on him and left him for dead with a face looking like a melted candle.  The first thing he does is kill just about the ugliest hooker in New York.  This could probably be considered a public service.

Meanwhile, back at camp, we meet some horny teenagers including a young, scene-stealing Jason Alexander.  These campers were in no way connected to the misdeeds of our killer's mutilation, but that doesn't stop him from killing a bunch of them simply because their counselor was one of the prankster's who wronged him.  This counselor seems like a great guy now, though. That is, until, he demonizes him in a true campfire tale of his mutilation.

It takes about an hour for the horror to start.  Until then it feels like an entertaining, raunchy teen camp R-comedy movie.  But when it does start it's fun.  I mean, the guy is slaughtering teenagers with hedge sheers--I have no clue where he got them.  So be ready for some slashing, throat-stabbing and finger-clipping goodness.  The corpse and prosthetics effects were done well for the time.

We get all of the typical campiness in this camp-horror classic.  Consistent with the time, we get bouncy bra-less breasts, extremely short shorts, sex scenes, skinny-dipping and shower scenes--there's a lot of nudity. The teen campers talk about sex (constantly) and smoke cigarettes in between lines of raunchy dialogue.  When they're not smoking in between talking about climbing on top of each other naked, they're climbing on top of each other naked.

To this end, I would warn folks away from watching this with preteen fledgling horror fans who can handle most R-rated horror.  The sexuality is inescapable and there are many scenes in which the guys get way to pushy with unwilling girls.  No rape or anything, but it'd be enough to make you uncomfortable around younger viewers.  That, and again, a LOT of nudity.

This was a great, campy, classic slasher movie which served as a teen, sex-driven comedy when blood wasn't being spilled.  I highly recommend it.",1365811200,,3225,4.810909090909091

1190922,4,B0000065N8,This was a great slasher film. It's like Freddy meets Jason minus the guy attacking you in your dreams. The killer is severely burned at a summer camp and seeks revenge on those at the summer camp. There is great suspense and some very memorable scenes. There is a lot of gore. I think this is a must have for any horror movie or slasher fan.,1362355200,,342,4.196969696969697
1190923,5,B0000065N8,"You can call it a Friday the 13th ripoff all you want, but THE BURNING is definitely an original. And while it perhaps is not as suspenseful as the original Friday the 13th, it is definitely a creepier and gorier film. It actually shares more in common with another slasher, Madman, than Friday as the killer in THE BURNING is closer to the killer in Madman than he is to Pamela Voorhees.

The plot in THE BURNING is based upon the oldest of horror tropes, revenge. After he leaves the hospital, Cropsy haunts the woods of another camp where one of his former pranksters/assailants is now a camp counselor. An element of surprise along with some graphic violence brilliantly orchestrated by the gore-maestro Tom Savini, marks this slasher as a cut above the rest.

An essential movie for any horror buff. Pick this up!",1356048000,2,818,4.673611111111111
1190924,5,B0000065N8,"My mom bought this video for me, after my first son was born.  He just turned 15!

I've used it fairly consistently since then.  I've gone some periods without it and I see a BIG difference in my body, and my agility, when it's not a part of the week (at least three times).  Lots of great upper and lower body strengthening.  Good ab challenges, too.

Yes, the styles are very outdated and the lady on the front isn't in the video, but the workout - a mix of cardio and weight - is the best you can possibly get out of 45 minutes, with a warmup and warmdown.

I remember my two boys being real little (1 and 3?) and them watching me do the tape - they wanted me to stop and pick them up and I'd just smile and continue doing the workout.  They'd hold onto my ankle and I'd just lift them along with the routine.  It was a long but worthwhile 45 minutes in those days - de-stressed me, improved my self image, mood, health and strength...and made me a better, happier Mommy.

I have used 3 lb, 5 lb and 8 lb weights along with the video.  I think the ladies on the video use much lighter but for the lunges and triceps, I like the heavier weights.

I have maxed my PT test in the Air Force for many years, and I attribute the ability to do mega pushups and situps to this video.  The cardio has also helped my aerobic endurance for the run.

I was afraid the VCR tape would break, so my love transferred it onto a CD - I don't believe it's available in DVD format.  So, now I have a backup.

I have some other decent videos but NOTHING has compared to this one.  Definitely - a great buy!",1348012800,2,1588,4.054662379421222
1190925,3,B0000065N8,"After hearing all the hype on this movie as a ""forgotten gem of the slasher era"",I thought I really missed something here and just had to see it for myself. Even one of the nearby theatres who strives to bring these ""classics"" back to a big screen with special midnight showings was screening this movie.  I guess I went into this with high expectations, so it's probably my own fault. Honestly, the movie kind of drags at points and almost puts you to sleep. Even though Tom Savini lends his creativity to the old-school gore effects when they  finally DO happen, it just isn't enough to pull this one out of the fire *pun intended* for most gorehounds. I'm not a huge fan of re-makes, but I could see this movie being revamped into something spectacular in the right hands. The overall premise of the story is good enough to really work into an awesome movie. I just don't think they did it here.

The script is not original and with the exception of the prostitute being killed in the beginning not alot happens for a bit.  Also, some of the scenes looked daylight then the next shot would be dark like it was night.  A camper went to get matches (him and his girlfriend strolled off to be alone) and in the span of a few sentences it went from day to night.  It was just odd.

1190972,4,B0000065N8,"In a summer camp named ""Camp Blackfoot"", a group of boys are planning to pull a prank on the weird, alcoholic, masochistic caretaker, Cropsy, during the middle of the night. They sneak into his cabin and set a rotting skull on fire, only to have Cropsy wake up and accidentally knock the skull onto his gas tank, causing flames to spread all over the cabin. The horrified boys then watch as Cropsy, engulfed in flames, stumbles out and falls down a ravine into a river, putting out the flames. Five years later, Cropsy is released from hospital, wearing a heavy coat, sunglasses and hat to hide his deformities. Out of rage, he murders a female prostitute. He then sets out to another summer camp named ""Camp Stonewater"".

The camp is populated with many characters, who are each going through their own situations: Eddy wants to get it on with the shy hottie Karen, Todd struggles as head counselor and seeks to find time to be with his girlfriend Michelle, eccentric and shy Alfred is trying to make friends with Dave, Woodstock and Fish, who are all trying to get back at cocky, cruel Glazer, who lusts for cutie Sally.

Cropsy makes it to the camp as everyone is playing baseball, and almost kills a female camper, but hesitates too long. The next morning, Sally goes to take a shower, senses that someone is inside the showers, and pulls back the curtain, exposing a shocked Alfred, who runs out of the shower. Sally's screams bring Karen, Michelle, Todd and Eddy, who catch Alfred, who Michelle insists should be thrown out, but Todd takes him to have a stern talking-to instead. During this conversation, Todd learns that Alfred does not have any friends, and was just trying to pull a prank on Sally to make her laugh. After the discussion, Glazer attacks Alfred and warns him to stay away from Sally, but Todd breaks them up, telling Glazer to cool off, and lets Alfred go and apologize to Sally.

Night rolls around, and Alfred spots Cropsy outside his window, but no one believes him, so he, Dave, Fish, and Woodstock go to the mess hall with everyone else. While everyone is eating, Karen tells Michelle that she and Eddy are going to spend the night together, and that she should be back before morning. After supper, everyone then goes to sleep, except for Karen and Eddy who sneak off into the woods by another lake, to skinny-dip. They begin to fool around in the lake, while someone takes Karen's clothes. Just as Eddy and Karen are about to have sex, Karen decides she's not ready, upsetting Eddy who tries to force himself on her, making her slap him. Eddy is outraged and orders her to leave him, which she does, only to discover that her clothes have been strewn all over the woods. She begins to collect them all, until she reaches her last article of clothing on a tree, where she is grabbed by Cropsy and has her throat viciously slashed. And Cropsy is just getting started....

A fun ""Friday the 13th"" rip-off that has some great death scenes and a memorable villain. Crospey has been and will always be freaky as hell. The problem with ""The Burning""? Too many damn characters. So many characters in fact that none of them really leave an impression so that you don't care who lives and who dies. This is a fun movie, don't get me wrong, but I always thought that it could be a better movie than what it is. So, why is it one of my favorite slashers of the 1980's? Simple. The deaths. And I do mean the deaths. The deaths in this splatter film have to be seen to be believed. Everything that you would want to see with garden sheers to nubile teens are done to extraordinary effect.

1190973,3,B0000065N8,"Do you enjoy low-budget, low-concept `80s slashers? Do you have a personal vendetta against janitors? Do you care to be mooned by George Costanza? If you answered ""Yes"" to any of these questions, ""The Burning"" just might be the film for you.

As one of the very first productions by indie legends Bob and Harvey Weinstein, ""The Burning"" was one of many low-rent slasher flicks birthed in the wake of ""Friday the 13th."" Like its obvious inspiration, ""The Burning"" takes place at a summer camp where -- you guessed it -- somebody is bent on taking revenge on a group of camp counselors who just want some good old fashioned summer fun. This time around, though, it's a janitor who was horribly disfigured during a poorly executed prank doing the mauling and not somebody's mother nor a horribly disfigured hillbilly.

""The Burning"" is a pretty formulaic film to be honest, but there's a silver-lining. The effects by Tom Savini (""Friday the 13th,"" ""Dawn of the Dead"") are absolutely top-notch and easily the best of their time. Shame, then, that it's up to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2"" director Jack Sholder to cut the film to ribbons. Thanks to strict limitations by the MPAA, much of the film's good stuff is held back or just not seen at all. In spite of not being an all-out gore bonanza as per its intentions, though, the film still gets by on its grim tone, which is set early on with the first proper killing. It also helps that we are asked to see things from the killer's perspective (shame he turns out to be such an unsavory character) which helps elevate the flick above typical slasher fare. Granted, the film doesn't aim for any sort of social statement or character development, but it's a noble effort in such a cheap affair.

Fans of the bygone golden era of slashers will find much to indulge upon with ""The Burning."" It's got a solid cast that features the likes of Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter in its ranks and despite the fact that it has a rather sluggish pace, it makes up for it with its mean spirit and nasty red stuff, albeit toned down considerably. Granted, there's a slew of superior slasher fare to be had amidst the competition, but ""The Burning"" is far from a burn-out itself.",1310428800,,2211,4.592405063291139
1190974,4,B0000065N8,"One of the most gratifying sights of cinema is when a batch of teen rotten acting is righteously punished by ferocious, bloody death ~ and that's basically 'the Burning.'

It's pointless being abstract - or even to get the brain out - for 'the Burning.' It is what it is: a great, stupid thriller set away at 'summercamp' (I've been to one of these: Glan Llyn, close to Bala Lake in North Wales. Run by an organisation called The Urdd ~ brutal fascists to a man. I was nearly killed when the canoe I was expertly and courageously manouevering over some 'Deliverance'- style rapids, suddenly tipped over...), with a maniac in the woods hacking at the kiddies with a garden-shears. Good.

It flies, has reasonable nudity, great gore-effects, a fab Rick Wakeman score ~ and vile, smug, bullying boys and vile, smug unsexy girls get diced and sliced by rote. Undemanding. A massive clunking film for idiots. The most sympathetic characters in the film are a guy who's unwittingly to blame for all the carnage.....and a sex pest.
'Cropsy' (chokes laughing), the burnt killer, is so subversive that he doesn't slaughter the sex pest when he has him at his mercy. Instead, he simply ties him up and starts playing with a welding torch until help arrives. Dumb pancake face.

'the Burning' boasts an air of slimy perniciousness which I adored. Cropsy has a vague vengeange vibe going on, but thankfully it's not explored in any depth - director Tony Maylem choosing to focus on big chunky violence and spurting cables. Stereotypical weedy smart-mouth loses his fingers 6 inches from the camera; stereotypical anorexic popsy has her forehead split open because she doesn't run away when she sees a disfigured, shears-weilding loonie staggering towards her; and a stereotypical meat-head gets (awesomely !) stabbed in the throat, carried through the air by dripping hedge-cutters before getting fixed - with an orgasmic, splashy thud - to a tree.
Come the dawn, one nuisance-slum family is one half-witted dependent down and Cropsy's earned his corn (groan).

Fans of early 1980's slasher films, arguably the golden era of the subgenre, will not be disappointed in this film even if, as he reveals in the commentary, the director feels it falls apart in the third act due to formulaic editing on the part of the producers. Nevertheless, The Burning is a fun if by-the-book slasher. Really, the only orignal aspect involves a nubile female victim ... who is killed because she chooses not to have sex.

This film actually has some decent character devlopment and you start to actually care about some of them. Also the buildup in the film at the summer camp doesn't come across as chessy filler like many of the f13 sequels that are only there to fill up time before the killing starts. The killer in this movie was a former janitor at the summer camp that was severely burned in a prank gone wrong and is now coming back for revenge. This film features some good kill scenes and gore effects by the legendary Tom Savini. Probably the most memorable part of this movie is the raft scene where in a montage type sequence the killer stabs five campers to death with a pair of hedge shears.

Also there is a good little twist that has to due with one of the counselors. All in all a good slasher movie that most will enjoy.,1284854400,2,758,4.026490066225166

Looking back it's amazing at the onslaught of thematically similar movies - many of them not even available on DVD - that hit in the early 80s.  Many of the lesser known entries didn't come close to the more famous Halloween and F13, although there were a number of exceptions.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Funhouse/dp/B00023P4SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Funhouse</a>&nbsp;was good.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tourist-Trap/dp/1573471046/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tourist Trap</a>&nbsp;(although arguably not a slasher movie, but in a similar vein; also, it actually Preceded Friday The 13th) was Really good.  Another one you can add to the list of high quality slash shockers from the era is this one, The Burning.

  It starts off in a summer camp flashback (yes, it's Very similar to the Friday The 13th series, especially the early ones) with a prank orchestrated by several young campers on the camp's cranky, foul-tempered groundskeeper, who goes by the nickname 'Cropsy'.  It's not an elaborate prank, just a simple get-back at the guy who's disliked and feared by all the campers for an apparantly violent temper (we never see what happened before the night of the prank, but are given the impression that he was quite the unpleasant, intimidating fellow).  It goes wrong, terribly wrong, setting the guy's cabin on fire.  The young pranksters are genuinely horrified as the small building - with a couple cans of flamable gasoline inside - goes up in seconds.  Cropsy survives, but is horribly burned and disfigured.

  Flash forward - I believe it's five years they flash forward, although it looks like the movie's other main character has aged more than five years - and we're at another summer camp not far from the first one.  Todd, one of the original group of pranksters, is head counsellor.  It appears he's trying to atone for what happened that night years before by running a different kind of camp than the old one (just what all else went on back there?)  It's at this camp that Cropsy makes his return.  Probably mentally unbalanced to begin with, it appears he's gone insane after the accident and the years of unsuccessful attempts to repair the damage done by the fire.  Filled with hate and armed with a pair of very sharp hedge shears, Cropsy begins taking revenge on anyone in sight (a trait we saw begin before he returned to the woods, with his vicious murder of a prostitute in New York), targetting and killing anyone he can catch alone in the woods.  It isn't long before people realize there's a psychpath on the loose and attempt to evacuate the camp, but Cropsy's killing spree has been well planned and a mass exodus of his potential victims wasn't included in those plans.

  As horror killers go, Cropsy is more menacing than many of his contemporaries, but admittedly he's not on par with Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers.  The movie didn't really call for that kind of iconic, virtually unstoppable figure.  The characterization and the acting are both well done, and uncommon attention is given to factors such as the cinematography, with unique camera angles helping to create atmosphere and suspense.

  It's impossible to discuss this movie without referencing Friday The 13th.  There are a LOT of similarities between The Burning and the first two F13s.  The first F13 was released in 1980; The Burning and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-2-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001K9OXE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part 2 (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;were both released in 1981 (I don't know which came first).  I notice Tom Savini worked on both movies, and it wouldn't surprise me if a few other people were in on both.  I envision a group of the moviemakers were discussing scenes for their films, and some ideas were so nice they ended up using them twice, perhaps not even fully concscious of just How similar certain things were going to look once they were onscreen.  However, even if it's just a case of movies 'borrowing' from one another, it doesn't hurt any of the end products.  The Burning is almost on par with the original Friday the 13th, although it can't quite compete with F13 2 (in my opinion, one of the very best in its series) .  As I mentioned Tom Savini worked on both this and the early F13s, I should mention the special effects.  They're very good here, although again not quite on par with Friday.  The Burning may have had a smaller budget or tighter shooting schedule.

  It may sound like I'm slamming The Burning in comparison to Friday The 13th; that isn't my intention.  I'm a huge F13 fan, and in my opinion noting that The Burning comes close to the original, and that it in fact surpasses several of the other F13 entries (a couple of them by wide margins) is strong praise.  The Burning has become a bit obscure over the years, partly because it never spawned any sequels, although who knows: if ""House Of The Wolf-Man"" (no relation to the recent big budget Wolf Man remake) is on its way more than Sixty Years after ""House Of Frankenstein"" and ""House Of Dracula"", perhaps Cropsy too will rise again.

  A strong 8/10.  Fans of Friday The 13th and similar horror, give this one a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1270512000,,5799,5.394444444444445

The Burning is a straight early 80's slasher flick. Its killer is Cropsy(give them a mulligan on that one, it was 1981), a former summer camp groundskeeper who is the victim of a prank gone wrong.

Just funny for some reason. Then there was Costanza. We have no idea if he came off as cool in 81 but watching this now was awesome. He was a wisecracking little dork who thought he was cool, tough, and all-knowing about the ladies. It was all hilarious and frankly, pushed the film to another level.

1191038,3,B0000065N8,"THE BURNING

(USA - 1981)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

An abusive caretaker at a lonely summer camp is disfigured by fire during a prank which goes horribly wrong. Five years later, he returns to the area to take revenge against one of his former persecutors (now a camp counsellor) and the kids in his charge.

Makeup artist Tom Savini rejected an opportunity to work on FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2 (1981) in order to create effects for Tony Maylam's THE BURNING, yet another in the assembly line of low-budget horror movies which emerged in the wake of HALLOWEEN (1978). Savini warned the film's producers - including a fledgling Harvey Weinstein! - that the script for THE BURNING shared uncomfortable similarities with the ""Friday"" sequel, though fans may have been too dazzled by the gruesome set-pieces to either notice or care.

In truth, THE BURNING shares only a handful of superficial details with ""Friday 2"", including a late night campfire episode in which the villain is dismissed as an urban legend, culminating in a false 'scare' which today's audiences will probably see coming a mile off. Despite a couple of groan-inducing incidentals (""Oh, I forgot my vitamins - I'll have to go back to my cabin through the dark, creepy woods!""), the narrative develops organically from one scene to the next, and characters react believably to the escalating situation. Unfortunately, the climax - set mostly within an abandoned mineshaft - is staged and executed with little flair or suspense, and amounts to something of a major disappointment.

Of course, the main point of interest - besides seeing some familiar faces in early roles, including Jason Alexander (TV's ""Seinfeld""), Fisher Stevens (SHORT CIRCUIT) and an unrecognisable Holly Hunter - is Savini's horrific makeup effects: Victims are slashed, stabbed, punctured and poked in graphic detail, and blood flows copiously from some horribly convincing wounds. Indeed, the film reaches a crescendo of horror during a notorious sequence involving an 'abandoned' canoe (I'll say no more), one of the most vicious set-pieces of the 1980's 'slasher' cycle. Briskly paced, and scored with a series of electronic doodles by no less than Rick Wakeman (!), THE BURNING may seem awfully simplistic to modern viewers, but it delivers the gory goods in no uncertain terms.",1255132800,,2343,5.152631578947369

How didn't it get popular?! How didn't Crospy become a household name like Jason, Freddy, or Michael?"" I feel that this film is one of the best the 80s slasher genre has to offer. Though the plot is similar to Friday the 13th, its not a complete carbon-copy as a lot of other slasher were. The acting is surprisingly good, (with the likes of Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander), and of course, the effects by the master Tom Savini, are superb! And perhaps most of all, it has a memorable villain as its centerpiece. So I just don't get how this one didn't become a big hit. Perhaps it was lack of exposure, or the fact that the infamous raft scene cause a bit of controversy. Now I'm not saying that this film is a masterpiece, but nonetheless, this film should be right up there with all the other famous slashers.

Also having seen the raft massacre scene before viewing this movie, a scene I saw coming ten miles away, I was a little suspicious.

PHEW! Was I ever wrong! ""The Burning"" is a suspenseful but entertaining, gory but exciting, shocking but fun movie. It has everything you could probably think of in an '80s slasher movie. Great special effects, buckets of gore, gratuitous amounts of nudity, exciting chase scenes and a happy ending. It's also got quite a realistic atmosphere, save the whole concept of a guy getting a body burn and then becoming inhumanly threatening.

There's also a good deal of character development and humor to boot. The comedy doesn't necessarily speed along the plot, but it DOES add to the entertainment. Believe it or not, we have a younger Jason Alexander (George Costanza on the wonderful ""Seinfeld"") as one of the camp counselors. Everything about this movie is great!

So if you want another classic slasher film for a night of thrills, chills and female body parts exposed in the shower, strike a match for this one! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1245369600,,1248,4.849765258215962

David Alexander it appears has always been an over actor, and was way too old for this part (Playing a teenager).
I like slasher flicks as much as the next guy but come on, the sex starved teens doing it in the woods, and of course the bad guy (Cropsy) is going to kill them.
The one witness that sees the dirty deed and reports it to the group leader isn't believed, (Boy does that sound familiar). The canoes are all gone and the campers are stranded, (Oh, Well it must be a joke).
The group builds a raft and sends half the campers back up stream for help and are attacked by Cropsy in broad daylight, (This being the one thing everyone thinks is original).
My question is would you just set there screaming waiting to die, or would you jump off the raft?
Then the raft floats back down stream, and everyone thinks it's just another joke, (ha ha you guys very funny, come on jokes over). How many times have we heard that line?
And finally, how many of you have watched the terrified teen running their butt off to get away from the killer who is just strolling along, only to have them run directly into the bad guy, who by the way isn't breathing hard and seems to know right where the teen is going.

Now he prowls the woods in search of victims to slash with his hedge clippers.  Unfortunately, this campfire tale is horribly true.

  ""The Burning"" is a classic revenge slasher from the eighties.  It is in the same mold as ""Friday 13th"" and ""Sleepaway Camp.""  Though not a mystery, because we know who is doing the killing, it does offer a tremendous amount of suspense and gore, thanks to make up artist Tom Savini (""Friday 13th"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"").  In a brief documentary, ""Blood 'n' Fire Memories,"" Savini demonstrates how many of the gorier scenes were created, including the notorious raft massacre.

  ""The Burning"" is a body count slasher; however, I wish the count had been higher and the deaths more evenly spaced throughout the film.  Most of the murders take place during the raft massacre.  There is a long dry spell between the prostitute who is stabbed near the beginning of the film and the first victim on the canoe trip.  Soon afterwards, there is the raft massacre.  Another dry spell follows and then two lovers are killed - a scene that was copied in ""Friday 13th Part V - A New Beginning.""

  Look for a pudgy teenage Jason Alexander (""Steinfield"" and ""Shallow Hal"") who provides a lot of comic relief as David, an adorable prankster.  Also, a young, cute Holly Hunter (""The Firm"" and ""Copy Cat"") has a small role as mischievous Sophie.

  Add ""The Burning"" to your collection of serial killer flicks from the slasher frenzy area.  MGM has done a wonder job of restoring and presenting the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Commentary, a trailer, and English subtitles have been provided.

Basic plot: Campers play a practical joke on a creepy caretaker leading to his horrific disfigurement when the joke goes awry. Said caretaker, badly burned, escapes from the hospital and returns to the camp to kill teenagers that had nothing to do with what had happened to him.

Some fun kills, namely the rafting scene many talk about. A little suspense. Some gratuitous nudity. Corny dialog sprinkled throughout. Overall, pretty typical 80's slasher fare.

This was a decent start to a movie that could have easily turned in to a successful franchise. Unfortunately, with the very similar Friday the 13th being released around the same time, this movie dropped off the radar with little notice.

1191045,3,B0000065N8,"Most of the Slasher films can hardly be reviewed as legitimate good films,let alone good Horror films,but there is however a quaint nostaligia given these early 80s gore-fests.

The Burning(1981) was one of the first films to embrace the formula featuring many of the ingrediants to build a good Slasher film:Summer camp,promiscuous teens,lots of nudity,a grotesque killer and of course,make-up by Tom Savini.

The film is surprisingly entertaining,telling the story of a horrendously burned former caretaker of a Summer Camp who takes revenge on the kids at the camp,five years later,being it was kids who burned him in a prank gone wrong.

What sets this film apart from some of it's brethern is that the acting is better than usual and characters are more likeable(including a young Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander) and the heroes being male,which is surprising,in the usually sexist Slasher films.

The film has also alot of atmosphere that creates for a fairly creepy experience and one particularly frightening gore piece that takes place in broad daylight.
Gore is gross,but excellently concieved by Savini,who creates some truly startling work here on the deaths and the creepy title character.
There is also a surprising amount of full frontal female nudity that will surely make the male viewers happy.

Still,the film is somewhat ordinary beyond that,even if it is just grindhouse fodder,despite some changes,it's still your typical slasher formula.
That ending though is one creepy wrap-up!
I'd apply an extra star if your a fan of Slasher and Gore films and detract one if your a film student.

The DVD itself is presented nicely with a beautiful letterbox print,a behind the scenes video on the FX of the movie,hosted by Savini and a Trailer.

The Burning is a 1980 slasher, part of the crop of 'classics' now being remade (and this will will be remade).  It's not dissimilar to Friday the 13th, mega-hit of the same year.  Seems that some dastardly kids want to play a prank on nasty old coot Cropsy, the alcoholic caretaker of a summer camp.  The prank ends up with Cropsy doing the walk of fire, toasted and left for dead.

Five years later, Cropsy unofficially takes up his old job of camp caretaker and begins bumping off a new crew of camp counselors, including Holly Hunter, Jason 'Costanza' Alexander, and Fisher Stevens.  It's an oddly semi-celebrity early reunion going on here in between Tom Savini's very bloody work.  And that work is left intact in this version, including the infamous raft massacre where Cropsy works those trademark hedge clippers with fury.

Some good effects, one or two creepy uses of the woods, but overall...for all of its 1980-ness and 'classic' slasher elements, this actually could have been much, much better.  They don't really show much of Cropsy, and not that they should...but still, they really don't do anything with him.  Not enough to warrant a sequel then, either.  And the fiery ending, there's something strange about it, like the director forgot to tell them he was actually filming that scene---it's a muted slasher climax.  And isn't 'Cropsy' an old legend told at every summer camp?  They don't play that angle up, either...there's nothing supernatural going on here, just Cropsy, really irate, with a pretty nasty face (how can he see to wield those blades?) knocking off fools.  I can definitely see a remake...in 3D, maybe depending on the success of My Bloody Valentine 3D.

But for this price, and the fact that they finally, finally released the damn thing in the US, it's certainly recommended to genre fans.  And Costanza is still Costanza, thought he is spared Cropsy's shears.

ALSO of note---in a sure sign that the world may soon end, not only did they finally release this on DVD, but around the same time, the Rick Wakeman soundtrack finally appeared on CD (which is probably still available).  Sought by fanatics and hedge clipper fans, it was out of print since the original vinyl.  Eventually, someone listens in the Burning archives.

It wasn't as awful as I thought it would be, but it's not great either.

The film takes place in a summer camp, but the location (I'm thinking somwhere in the Northwest) is quite striking and the abandoned mine and the forest really lend itself well to the film.  It has some genuinely creepy atmosphere.  However, the dialogue is quite awful, and most of the performances are pretty lame too.  The film is paced quite poorly as well.  It is cool to see Jason Alexander in one of his first roles (possibly his first).  Aside from being bald now and slightly pudgier, he has aged rather well.  He gives a decent performance despite the extremely limited material.  This film was lumped together with the other slasher films of its day, and kind of got lost in that shuffle.

The Burning is not only violent, it's also stylish. The synth-theme makes the film stand out, and it utilizes the camera and environments very well to tell a straightforward story about regular teenagers caught in the vendetta of a madman. It's rare that the teenagers aren't obnoxious or unlikable, and since there is some good time spent with the bunch before the real horror strikes, I came to somewhat like them when they are finally dispatched in the legendary raft massacre sequence.

1191062,4,B0000065N8,"Believe it or not this is my first slasher movie, so I don't have the knowledge to give you a doctoral thesis on the genesis of the faceless killer or anything. I never really liked slasher movies, at least what I saw in the trailers. They just seemed...tedious. I don't know why, I like all kinds of genre films, some of which my friends won't even watch. I just never got into them. But I saw that Jason Alexander, George Costanza himself, was in this film and I had to see it. How could anyone resist Costanza vs. a Slasher? I was hoping maybe he'd use the old ""Jerk Store"" routine on the slasher.

  Well sir, I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think this movie speaks for the entire genre of slasher flicks, but this one accounted for itself pretty well. It moved along pretty briskly even though the killer doesn't do any serious damage until maybe 45 minutes into the movie. Until that point there is some decent suspense and plenty of nubile young hi-jinx. Larry Joshua plays the musclehead Glazer, sex hound and dead from the neck up, as the arrogant and bullying buffoon you want to see get his. Brian Backer, who also played Mark Ratner in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, plays the creepy loner Alfred, a symbol of teen angst and alienation. Fisher Stevens plays the dart gun toting Woodstock and Leah Ayres and Carrick Glenn provide some of the aforementioned nubile-osity. (???) Jason Alexander is pretty funny as Dave, the wisecracking camp porn connection.
 He's more self-assured than Costanza, maybe because of that full head of hair, and I couldn't really imagine his character as a young George Costanza, but he's still funny.

  We know just all we need to know about the killer and his back-story. He's given a quick and dirty motivation to wipe out sexy young campers (don't worry, Costanza isn't sexy) and then sent to work. He takes most of them out with some pruning shears and folks these are some very special pruning shears. They look and cut like they are made of adamantium or Excalibur reforged. I mean he slices through fingers, limbs, skulls and trees like they're lemon meringue pie. And he's pretty creative in the way he cuts them up. The gore is very effective thanks to Tom Savini and the raft scene is downright shocking and brutal.

The title refers to the way the killer was brutalized by some young campers years ago (in a prank gone wrong! How many great villains come about THAT way?) One of the campers that burned ol Cropsy grew up into one of the camps current counselors, and it is this person the killer, Cropsy, is primarily after. The entire story comes full circle when the killer uses one of those mini-flamethrowers that some gardeners use to burn weeds, to blow torch the counselor, giving him a taste of hot propane justice.

1191063,4,B0000065N8,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. In some ways, it follows the standard ""revenge on sex-crazed teens"" premise of the Friday the 13th movies and their knock-offs. But this movie does it in a way that is better than those knock-offs, and in my opinion better than the Jason flicks. While the sheer strength of the villain and the many uses of the hedge clippers he uses may be a little hard to swallow, everything else about this movie is pretty realistic. The campers aren't as stupid as the victims in most slasher movies; the final showdown is believable as well.

The thing that really makes this movie stand out is the suspense. This movie has many ""red herring"" scares and jumps, and interchanges them perfectly with the real scares so that the viewer never knows what is going to happen next. I would like to see a remake of this film with some higher production values, but I doubt they could recapture the thrills of this film.

As a side note, Jason Alexander (AKA George Costanza from ""Seinfeld"") with a full head of hair is a great addition, as is the sex-crazed, slightly insane GLAZER.",1221609600,,1099,4.6020408163265305

1191066,3,B0000065N8,"...this is not a great movie.

The Burning has a flimsily contructed generic slasher plot that doesn't really provide a story but does provide enough room to include all the ingredients that made this genre sell so well to movie theatres packed with a largely male teenage audience in their 1980's heyday: soft female nudity and violent, gory killings.

In summary, camp caretaker Cropsy is burned by a group of teenagers in a camp prank gone wrong and returns to exact his revenge on anyone foolish enough to still be going to summercamp. Pretty run of the mill stuff and queue shots of teenage girls jiggling around fields playing baseball or showering or swimming.

What alone elevates this movie to one worth watching from the horror fan's perspective though are the killing scenes. Their sometimes unusual settings, lingering, want-to-but-can't-look-away direction and truly nasty, brilliantly constructed special makeup effects evoke a real savagery that leaves a lasting impression.

Some may find this savagery a little too graphic - clearly many film censors at the time could be counted among that number - but they can be enjoyed purely for shock value and for technical excellence too.

Incidentally, a full step by step breakdown of ""King Of Splatter"" Tom Savini's effects for this film can be found in his book Grande Illusions and is definitely worth reading once youe've seen them, even if just to reassure yourself that no, they didn't really kill all those teenagers!",1219708800,,1485,5.069672131147541

Cleverly based on the old campfire terror tales of tradition, ""The Burning"" may sound like a flat-out rip-off of ""Friday the 13th"". Well, the filmmakers claim they had this story BEFORE ""Friday the 13th"", and maybe they did, because it somehow feels like a better movie than the usual Jason fare. The campers seem more real and sometimes even likeable (though I can't help but hate them a little for having so much fun; is summer camp really like it is in the movies?), and Tom Savini's makeup/effects work doesn't hurt the film either. It is a bit hard to tell the campers from the counselors at times, even though some folks looked too old to be at summer camp, and seeing Jason ""George Costanza"" Alexander as the life of the party with a full head of hair is just plain weird, ha, but overall it's a great piece of classic slasher fun that you definitely should see if you're into '80's horror.

1191103,2,B0000065N8,"The Burning (Tony Maylam, 1981)

My oh my, Harvey Weinstein, the things folks at movie networks dig up when your back is turned. How quickly did you disown the piece of tripe when Miramax was trying to make itself into a high-class movie distributor? IFC, however, has dragged the skeleton out of your closet, and you must own up to it.

Released during the early eighties glut of slasher films, The Burning managed to fade into obscurity at an almost alarming pace, despite having some major starpower attached to it behind the scenes (the score was composed by former yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman, director Tony Maylam had filmed the 1976 Genesis world tour that also spawned the live Seconds Out album, makeup and special effects were done by Tom Savini, etc.). Even more odd is that it's stayed obscure despite having some major-league starpower emerge from it (Jason Alexander, Holly Hunter, Larry Joshua, and Fisher Stevens all had their first acting jobs in this film; Brian Backer, Leah Ayres, and Ned Eisenberg were all very early in their careers). You'd think someone would have dug it up before 2008, but no.

The plot is your basic slasher film kind of thing: a sadistic camp caretaker, Cropsey (Lou David), has a prank played on him by some campers, and it goes wrong. Five years later, Cropsey is released from the hospital, and returns to the camp to wreak mayhem on the current campers. It's the early eighties, so you can expect awful fashion and even worse hair, but it's the dialogue that's truly unforgivable in this movie. There are so many bad lines ripe for quoting this would make an excellent drinking game.

The one thing that did strike me, when compared to more recent slasher flicks (and by ""more recent"" I'm comparing it to movies that came out four or five years later, in some cases), is the nudity. Yeah, yeah, I know, but if you watch this movie, and then watch later slasher films (or art flicks with lots of unclothed bodies), the women in this movie are much more appealing. There's no sense of artificiality about them. Hey, Hollywood, can we get back to the natural thing, please?

What truly annoyed me about this movie, however, is the way that the setup opened up so many interesting possibilities for twists on the rapidly-becoming-trite-even-in-1981 tropes of the genre, and how it managed to scrap every one of them in order to cling for dear life to those same tropes. As the movie opens (in the present, anyway), we have an immediate setup for a really interesting turn: Todd, the head counselor (Brian Matthews), has taken perverted misfit Alfred (Backer) under his wing, both to try and socialize him a bit and to protect him from the other camp nut, Glazer (Joshua), who's just as deviant, but socially acceptable because he's a jock. Once you've got the secluded-area setup (a bunch of campers go out on a canoe trip) that contains both Alfred and Glazer, taking Todd out of the picture would have opened up a whole can of worms-- not only do you have a serial killer on the loose, but you've got two obviously unbalanced kids in the same area with little, if any, supervision. I kept waiting for this (or any of the other interesting twists that might have occurred given various parts of the setup) to happen, but nope. So much unrealized potential here, and not a glimmer to show that the writers even knew that potential was there.

Only of interest to the dedicated slasher film fan these days. And anyone looking for more reasons to make fun of the Weinstein brothers. **",1201564800,,3529,4.702265372168285
1191104,1,B0000065N8,"The one thing I'll say about true fans of this genre is that they are easily pleased.  And regardless of what readers of my reviews may think, I DO NOT dislike all horror movies.  In fact, I anticipate most releases with great eagerness hoping that I'll finally find something worthwhile. In this case, I'm still waiting.

Originally released in 1981, The Burning was made between Friday the 13th and The Prowler, although supposedly written BEFORE both.  Tom Savini did the special effects, and I hate to disappoint him but I found them way below his usual mind-blowing efforts.  Blood looked orange in some parts; it gushed like cherry Kool-Aid in others.  But NONE of the effects were believable.  I did thoroughly enjoy the ""night scenes,"" which were shot in BROAD DAYLIGHT.  I got so confused, I couldn't tell when it was day and when it was supposed to be night...

The premise of the movie is (of course) extremely routine.  Camp Blackfoot children don't like the caretaker--I didn't even know that summer camps HAD caretakers--so they devise a plan to scare the living daylights out of him.  Ah, the best laid plans of juveniles and idiots...  The plan goes awry, Cropsy is burnt to a crisp, rehabs, and then comes back to a different camp (across the lake--natch) and starts to kill.  And kill.  And kill.  And, well, you get the picture.

This is the biggest problem I had with the movie.  Had the writers thought out their plans a little better, why not at least have Cropsy come back AFTER the juveniles who caused him harm?  Why did he just come back--to a DIFFERENT camp--and start his mass slaughter?

I find it even harder to imagine this film was actually BANNED in some southern states because it was too graphic.  Geez, this relatively tame movie gets banned and Hostel gets an R.  Go figure.  The movie last 91 minutes and contains nudity, sexual references, and violence.  I do not recommend it.

Entertaining and gory to the max slasher movie that is one of the most overlooked slasher movies ever! Tom Savini's make-up effects are mindblowing even by today's standards as i think he is the master of all make-up artists. The film co-stars Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander before their major film careers, there's some incredible graphic violence such as the infamous raft massacre sequence with more of the gore that was cut out and restored on this DVD. The music score is quite chilling as well, it's not for the faint of heart but a must have for fans of ""Sleepaway Camp"" and ""Friday The 13th"" alike.

1191156,4,B0000065N8,"In the 80s slasher films were a dime a dozen; It seemed every week a new one was opening. More often than not a lot of these films simply get lost in the shuffle. The Burning though has remained a cult favorite despite being out of print for a long time. A few things that helped The Burning known was for the fact it happens to be the first movie by the Weinstein's. And of course there is the cast; The Burning was the screen debut for Holly Hunter, Fisher Stevens, Brian Backer and Jason Alexander. And what helps keep The Burning so well known was the raft scene, which is one of the best scenes you'll ever find in a slasher flick.

As a child I lived for these movies, even as a young child I don't think you can find many people a bigger fan of slasher flicks than me. But as I got older I found myself going back and watching these flicks I loved and watching some for the first time and suddenly I didn't like them nearly as much. I still enjoy slasher flicks from time to time, but now as an adult very few would make my all time favorite horror movie list. The Burning is one of the few that I still enjoy.

Bottom line is if you've seen one slasher flick you pretty much have seen them all. The Burning doesn't quite offer us anything we haven't seen before. But the movie still works and despite some flaws it's still enjoyable. The Burning is probably one of the better made slasher flicks of the 80s. It's an 80s slasher not an Oscar contender. But it's actually rather well made overall.

The Burning gets off to a solid start, but does slow down in the middle sections. We do get about a 45-min gap or so without a kill scene. And there were too many scenes shot in the daytime. Horror flicks always work best when set at night. Day scenes can be quite creepy; John Carpenter's Halloween is a prime example. But there were just too many daytime scenes and it does hurt the suspense a little bit. But despite the gap in-between the kill scenes and the daytime scenes The Burning still for the most part works well.

While the script by Harvey Weinstein and Peter Lawrence isn't a masterpiece it is good enough to help keep things interesting. Most of the characters lack any depth, but they still work well. This is the typical screenplay for an 80s slasher, but it's probably better written than most of the others.

The cast also is able to help keep things interesting; most of the performances are pretty good for this type of flick and any scene Jason Alexander is in works great. He simply steals the show. The more screen time Jason Alexander has the better The Burning works.

Director Tony Maylam does a fairly good job at keeping the pace moving along, but in my opinion The Burning does lack some suspense and tension. There are a few scenes of Cropsey lurking in the back that raises the tension, but overall as much as I did enjoy the movie the tension does lack. Despite the gaps in kill scenes, Maylam foe the most part is able to keep The Burning from becoming boring and is able to keep it interesting.

Like I brought up earlier there were just too many scenes shot in the daytime and while you can create some scary and suspenseful scenes it just hurts the tension a little bit. The final act is quite solid, but some of the suspense is lost due to the daytime shooting. But overall Tony Maylam does a good job and makes one of the better slasher flicks of the 80s.

Another thing that makes The Burning stand-out to the many 80s slasher flicks is the gore, which was done by Tom Savini; when you have Savini involved you pretty much know you are in for a gory good time. Many people consider this some of his best work, but I have to disagree. While the gore is excellent it doesn't flow as much as the reputation it has. And while the gore looks excellent I think Savini went onto do some better work.

Don't get me wrong if you want gore you'll pretty much find it here, the kill scenes are quite graphic. The sheers through the neck was a very brutal kill scene. While The Burning has plenty of gore I actually seen a lot more. Even with it being the Weinstein's first movie despite some of the cast members going on to some bigger things what really truly gives The Burning the cult status and made sure it was remembered by horror fans is the raft scene.

The raft scene is without a doubt one of my very favorite scenes in a horror movie. I'm not gonna spoil it for those out there who have not seen the movie, but the reputation the raft scene gets is very much deserving. It's simply one of the very best scenes you'll ever see in a slasher or any horror flick for that matter.

One of the most interesting things about The Burning is there is no final girl. For those who may not have heard that term, the final girl is the last person left in the final act and the one who normally survives and kills off the killer. Not only is there no final girl there actually isn't even really a main character. Some play a bigger part than others, but there really is no character in particular the movie focuses on. I'll give credit to the makers on that; the lack of a lead character can hurt, but here it actually works to the advantage of the movie.

While there is a decent sized body count there were also too many people left alive at the end. As much as I enjoyed The Burning it could have used maybe 1 or 2 kill scenes in the middle sequences. The funny thing about that is though The Burning has a pretty good body count. The problem is too many of them come more towards the final act. And the main reason for the body count being high is due to one scene in particular. The Burning could have used one or two more in the middle or at the very least had some editing to help the scenes run at a smoother pace.

The Burning if often compared to Friday the 13th, but apparently it was written before. But comparisons will still be made. In my opinion The Burning just might be the more entertaining, but the less creepy of the two. If you are a fan of slasher flicks and just looking for a gory good time The Burning should get the job done. Despite some flaws The Burning is one of the better 80s slasher flicks and still to this day remains a fun movie. Sure it's dated in some areas and it doesn't break any new ground. But it's still a very fun and entertaining movie

In closing, while The Burning may not break any new ground it rates as one of the better slasher flicks of the 80s and while it does lack suspense and tension at times it's more than made up for in the fun and in the gore department. Maybe not a classic of the genre, but a classic slasher flick for sure

In its time, alot of the scenes were considered too graphic so the film was either banned in many countries or severely edited.  Having recently seen the new DVD version which is fully uncut, I have to wonder what all the fuss was about for this film. On top of that, it was downright slow to get moving. If this film was released now in 2007 it would not even raise an eyebrow.

The film's saving grace is that it is from 1980 and collector's will want it in their collections to compliment other films from that period. Look out for a young Holly Hunter in a few of the scenes.

1191194,4,B0000065N8,"(3.5/5 stars)  ""The Burning"" begins by giving away too much of the movie: Cropsy, an allegedly mean-spirited, drunken caretaker at a summer camp, is inadvertently burned beyond recognition by some campers wanting to scare the man. (OK, now the title is out of the way)  Cropsy spends the next five years in the hospital recovering from his wounds and as he exits, a doctor warns him to not seek vengeance on the kids who did it to him. Of course, it comes as a surprise to absolutely no one that he heads straight for the camp, where unsuspecting teens are casually frittering away their youth. The only surprises thereafter are the manner in which the kids perish. (Hey, at least the first ""Friday the 13th"" kept some revelations until the end!) This is neither an original nor an outstanding film, yet it is noteworthy for several reasons. In addition to being written by Harvey Weinstein, it marks the first time he produced a feature film. There are also appearances by several actors, who would go on to become fairly well-known: Jason Alexander had a rather substantial first feature film role here as camper Dave before becoming indelibly linked to George Costanza; Holly Hunter is far less visible as camper Sophie in her first feature; and Fisher Stevens (""Short Circuit,"" etc) has a memorable role as Woodstock in his first feature. As Sally, Carrick Glenn is an unbelievably pretty actress, who unfortunately (for us) had a very brief film career. In fact, all the performances are quite competent. Additionally, special effects guru Tom Savini stamps the film with his usual seal of extreme gore. Finally, MGM did a wonderful job with this DVD; the transfer looks terrific and there are actually English subtitles for those of us who want to make certain we correctly understand the important dialogue.

Let's get what's 'good' about this movie out of the way first: Tom Savini did the special effects and he did a pretty good job. There's a couple of scenes of full frontal nudity. You get to see some annoying kids get violently dispatched.

The problem is it's nothing new and nothing special. It felt like the Weinstein's wrote the script after reading Slasher Films For Dummies. If the only slasher movie you've seen before this one is the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B00001MXXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;(which came out a year earlier), you can still predict everything that will happen. This movie isn't even a copy of Friday the 13th. It's a copy of a copy. It felt like the people making this movie didn't like or understand horror movies. They hit all the right notes for a slasher movie without seeming to understand the genre. It's no surprise that these guys would later head up Dimension films and churn out endless&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/B00004W20F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>s,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination/dp/B000FBHCAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination</a>s and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/B000A5045Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>s.

When you think about it, there's no rhyme or reason for anything that happens in this movie. A pissed off guy picks a bunch of kids at random and bumps them off. No, never mind. That sounds like the plot to an okay movie at least. There is zero suspense or tension in this flick. For the first forty minutes or so at camp, NOTHING happens. This time isn't used to foreshadow anything or establish the killer's motivation or anything. Just a half hour or so of weird looking kids at summer camp. At the end they sort of try to tie it back to the beginning, but when the big 'revelation' happens, you realize that even though you as a viewer can see a connection, the killer wouldn't have this info.

I don't know. Most of the other reviews I've read for this movie are pretty enthusiastic, so maybe it's me. But aside from the over-the-top violence and copious nudity, this film was a total letdown. And is it just me, or are garden shears just sort of a goofy weapon?",1190678400,4,2500,5.878787878787879

As a young, nubile horror geek I would have been well advised to have watched this rather than some of the terrible Friday the 13th sequels in the 80s. This one is very similar to Friday the 13th with the campers and remote rural setting but it has some good, well known actors, decent character development and a few genuinely suspenseful moments. I wouldn't say its a lost classic but it doesn't suck either. And given the sad state of most of today's horror films, its actually pretty good..",1190505600,4,532,4.494845360824742

So, a group of boys crept out of their cabin one night and went to the caretaker's shed. Finding Cropsy inside, passed out in a drunken stupor, one boy entered and left the ""gift"" for Cropsy. Well, things didn't quite go as planned. Cropsy woke up, saw the hideous ""joke"", panicked, and somehow ended up on fire! Not good. Now, long after the failed skin-grafts, after the hospital released him without being able to help him, Cropsy is back. The kids are back too, back at camp for the summer. THE BURNING is a surprisingly effective tale of revenge and bloodletting, where the killer is actually pretty frightening. Cropsy is dark and silent, like a deadly shadow. He is vengeance incarnate, with no reason to live other than to destroy those who have destroyed him. He gave my flesh a nice crawl! The raft scene is legend! Tom Savini's make-up and gore fx are very realistic. Also, the kids aren't all that annoying. I actually cared whether they lived or died! I even wanted some of them to escape their fate! As much as I love FRIDAY THE 13th 1 and 2, HALLOWEEN 1 and 2, or any other maniac-on-the-loose movies, I only get the shudders when watching Cropsy do his thing!

The characters are somewhat likeable and its really funny to see Jason Alexander(George from Seinfeld)young,in shape and with a full head of hair.

DEFINITELY recommended for any horror/slasher fan out there with intention of adding to their library. I'm so glad this finally had an official release!

1191232,4,B0000065N8,"No, this film isn't about Chlamydia, it's a long forgotten(but not by horror fans) slasher flick.  The ""burning"" is actually a reference to a prank gone wrong(of course) that burns a sadistic camp caretaker to a crisp and turns him into a killing machine hell bent on revenge.  He's not too picky on who he slaughters as long as it's campers.  Basically what we got here is a plot right on par with Friday the 13th.  While the plot won't be mistaken for original and the acting may not be oscar worthy, this little slasher flick is alot of fun and actually one of the better films in the genre.  As a previous reviewer stated, alot of the kills in this film are in the daytime, which is a bit different.  The first few minutes of the film actually follow the character of ""Cropsy"" as he's discharged from the hospital and tries to get it on with a hooker(not much better looking than him I might add), only to disgust her with his appearance, forcing him to kill her.  Realizing he's never gonna have a normal life(or get laid) again, he then decides he may as well get revenge and takes to the camp to continue with his bloodlust.  This intro was kinda different and cool as well.  Another bonus is that this film wasn't afraid to up the ante in the gore department.  It's not Dead Alive, but a little bloodier than you may expect.  Cropsy's method of dispatching campers are a pair of garden shears.  Not exactly the weapon I would use-kinda unreliable-but Cropsy makes it work.  The teenagers are a bit more likeable than most you find in these films.  Jason Alexander has hair!  Holly Hunter is credited with a small role, but don't get too excited coz she has very little screen time and practically no lines other than some whimpering and crying.  This dvd pretty much only gives us a short interview with Tom Savini as a bonus feature, but it's always a pleasure to listen to Savini talk about movies he's done.

1191234,4,B0000065N8,"Originally released in 1981, The Burning may seem like Friday the 13th redux (the original Friday only came out a year before this did), but make no mistake that this slasher is better than any installment of that long running and tired series.  The Burning revolves around a camp terrorized by the deranged Cropsy (Lou David), who five years prior was the victim of a prank gone horribly awry, which has left him horribly burned to the point where no skin grafts of any kind could take.  Naturally, a camp full of horny teenagers should sate his homicidal desires.  What really makes The Burning memorable are the inventive makeup and gore effects of legendary FX master Tom Savini (coming hot of the success of Dawn of the Dead and Friday the 13th), as well as the super early appearances from future Oscar winner Holly Hunter, as well as funnyman Jason Alexander and Fisher Stevens.  It's also worth noting that the film was written and produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein; before their upstart company Miramax went to runaway success.  The DVD doesn't have a plethora of extras, but it does have a commentary track from director Tony Maylam as well as a featurette with Tom Savini who recollects on his work and experiences making the film.  All in all, slasher movies rarely get any better than this, and if you've never seen The Burning, you should definitely check it out.",1189555200,6,1380,4.729166666666667

Even though the dvd is fullscreen - I hope the new version gets the aspect ratio correct. To start with the opening of the film is a good start to a horror film. In the scene when The victim visits the prostitute on the dvd you can really notice the bad effect where after the scissors are removed after the stabbing scene there is only half the scissors in view. The boat scene where the sheers cut the fingers off now looks terrible on closer inspection and looks like a plastic hand. Also at the end of the film the  burns victims face is so obviously a mask as the mouth doesn't match the mask. I think these defects are really going to show up badly on the new dvd release. Still a great film and better than most new horror films out now but when you check out how they did the effects it does look pretty cheaply made.

I personally love the killer in the woods slashers and this is the perfect premise.

The kids at a summer camp play a trick that goes terribly wrong on Cropsy the mean spirited grounds keeper and he is burned beyond recognition, Flash to hospital  where the horribly burned and disfigured Cropsy is being treated and going through physical therapy then released with  a warning that it will take him awhile to adjust to being in the outside in his disfigured state and most people will be frightened at his appearance.p

Flash to the seedy part of Times square wjhere he picks up a prostitute and when she reacts in a horrified manner to his appearance he loses it and kills her. After seeing the first kill I knew it was going to be a great slasher film.

Flash back to the woods ""summer camp "" Cropsy returns to the scene of the crime to wreak havoc and spill PLENTY of blood .I don't understand why they didn't make a sequel ,Cropsy and his garden shears are scarier than Jason and his machete  anyday as far as I'm concerned.

That having been said, this is one of the better slasher films from the early 1980's that came in the wake of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH. Cropsy is the caretaker at a summer camp who likes to bully and intimidate the kids. One night a group of kids get sick of it all and plan a prank to scare the living hell out of him. They get a skull (from where, the science lab?) put a bunch of worms and lighted candles in it and sneak it into his cabin while he's asleep. Then they begin wrapping on his window and making howling noises to wake him up. They just want to scare him, but unfortunately when he wakes up he gets so badly scared he kicks over the skull and sets himself on fire and ends up horribly burned. He is sent to the hospidal and released five years later. The skin grafts didn't work, so he's still horribly disfigured. He returns to the woods where there's another summer camp in session, and takes his garden shears with him...

If you're a slasher fan, this is a good way to spend the afternoon. There's lots of good kill scenes and creepy moments. One thing, though. One of the counclers is one of the kids who played the prank on Cropsy. In fact, I believe he was the very one who planted the skull in Cropsy's room. While it may not be too hard to believe he would later go back to camp as a councler, there is one scene where before Cropsy makes his presense known and starts killing people this guy who helped pull the prank tells the story to the kids as a scary campfire story. He's using a rather tramatic tale that he knows is true and that he himself was directly invovled in as a scary campfire story, and he even fictionalizes certain parts, saying that Cropsy swore revenge even while he was on fire, and that he disapeared after that, and says Cropsy is now living out in the woods like and animal and is out to get them, having no idea just how true that last part is, all for the sake of scaring and entertaining the kids.

If you are a horror movie fan this is a must see.",1054339200,3,302,4.8431372549019605
1191308,1,B0000065N8,"Well, let me explain the header.  Casablanca is arguably one of the best films ever.  And to say Friday the 13th is like that film in comparison to utter swill like The Burning, that's quite a bashing.  The greatest detriments have to be the acting and the script.  The ONLY reason to watch this refuse is for the raft scene-- admittedly impossible to achieve such carnage with a pair of shears, but still entertaining-- and that's only in the Amazon release, to my knowledge.  And you can find that raft massacre on a clip somewhere on the web, so get that instead of this film.",1054166400,4,579,4.476190476190476
1191309,5,B0000065N8,"This movie rocks!! its a great gruesome teen horror flick, the only thing that we need is for amazon and mgm to release it UNCUT on DVD!!

1191311,4,B0000065N8,"There are so many slasher-movies with the usual cliches; dumb blondes (no offence) that are running up the stairs instead of running just out the front door to escape from the boogeyman; cars that don't start; everybody being killed one by one, and in the end the bodies suddenly pop up when the only survivor (the dumb blonde) finally starts to suspect there's something wrong etc.
This flick is totally different, 5 people are killed by the maniac at the same time in broad daylight. Their bodies are discovered by a whole group of teens, who are crying for the lost of their friends. This is the first time that such things are shown in a slasher-movie and I had my share.
So this movie has an entertaining story and isn't that predictable as most of the slasker-movies are. The SFX are also very good.
My advise, if you like slasher-movies don't miss out on this one, but also don't expect a -nightmare on Elm street- success.",1046649600,26,930,4.574850299401198

1191313,4,B0000065N8,"If your a fan of the typical B horror movies produced in the early 80's then you must view The Burning.
It has everything you look for in a horror movie some teenagers looking to have a good time, some nudity, some partying, and a demented, disfigured maniac(Cropsy) slashing up teenage flesh. Cropsy was an old camp counselor who was the brunt of a prank gone extremely wrong. He was burned badly and left for dead. A few years later however Cropsy has returned for REVENGE! There is some nice gore in this film and a scene in which Cropsy kills four teens in about 10 seconds.
The Burning is similar to Friday The 13th in a lot of areas. I would suggest you see The Burning if your a fan of Friday the 13th or just a fan of early 80's horror classics.",1028419200,,753,4.236111111111111
1191314,4,B0000065N8,"The joyful tales of the fabled summercamp getaway have come to us through the ages and actually made their ""impact"" in the 80's. Its easy to see why, too, because so many people can associate with the plights of the atypical camper. Having to deal with all those awkward situations as a teenager, from the pesky interactions with attractive semi-clad to altogether naked females to the bullyesque intimidation of ""swimming with human sharks,"" seems to make life hard. Mingle this with the brutal aspects of that new kid's game, throat gardening, and its easy to see why parents keeping sending their children back for more.
This installment in the killing fields/camping mentality films mixes better-than-average acting (seeing Jason Alexander with hair seems to be an odd experience to people only familiar with his Seinfeld days), some nice touches of gore, and a menacing pair of hedgeclippers into something that stands above many of the ""classic"" slasher films. It nice to see the concepts of so many movie failures mixed into a better forum and done pretty well, leaving you to sit back, get to know the characters, and count them as the bodies drop.
Its definately something to pick up for calming your kid. Show them this and tame that troubled tot without having to shell out a fortune or go on daytime television. The threat of being dismembered has its advantages!",1024704000,6,1375,4.931034482758621

1191316,4,B0000065N8,"THE BURNING is a rare case of a ...[copy] overshadowing the film that it inspired it.  In this case, that film would be FRIDAY THE 13th.  Both films have the same core plot: a summer camp haunted by a vicious killer and... teenagers who get it on and then get offed just as quickly.  Several pluses that make THE BURNING a better film, however, are the actual presence of ""characters.""  In FRIDAY THE 13th, the counselors were faceless, barely distinguishable from one another.  So in the end, who gives a hoot if they get their throats cut?  While the characters in THE BURNING are not exactly ORDINARY PEOPLE-caliber, at least their relationships and personalities are interesting.  Heading the list are Todd (Brian Matthews) as a tough but sympathetic-to-the-underdog camp counselor; Alfred (Brian Backer), a geeky outcast with a penchant for spying on girls in the shower; Michelle (Leah Ayres), Todd's feisty and sensible girlfriend.  Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, and Holly Hunter also make early appearances here.  THE BURNING also has a brooding, ominous atmosphere, as well as a nice sense of humour to counter-balance the atmosphere. Finally, the film also subverts our expectations by killing off folks unexpectedly, and in daylight, no less.  Two word: raft massacre.  Five people get it right there in broad daylight, easily popping that theory that you have to be alone for a killer to come after you.  Take that, Ms.  Voorhees.
Bottom line?  While FRIDAY THE 13th set the stage, THE BURNING -- in my opinion -- set the standard.
This film is currently available on DVD only in England, and viewable on region 2 or region-free DVD players only (which I am getting soon).  In the US, you can order the tape through Amazon.  Or buy a region-free DVD player if you can afford it ...and order the DVD for THE BURNING from amazon.co.uk.  Otherwise, what are you guys waiting for? The tape's right here!  It's well worth it.",1017187200,3,1935,4.883435582822086
1191345,4,B0000065N8,"Only some minor holes in the plot keep this from being a 5 star flick. First let me advise you to see the uncut version, the censored version lacks the pizzazz that is sorely needed to get thru the plot holes aforementioned. In fact without the Savini effects this movie would garner only 3 stars and would be hopelessly lost in the run-of-the-mill camp-slasher flicks that permeated the 70s/80s.
It's quite a kick watching Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter portraying teens caught up in this bloody little movie. Will they become sliced and diced victims?  -- I'm not gonna spoil it.
Well worth the effort to find it uncut. Enjoy!",1016150400,2,630,4.7272727272727275
1191346,4,B0000065N8,"This movie absolutely deserves recognition for the debut appearances of star talents Jason Alexander (Seinfield), Holly Hunter (Copycat, Living Out Loud), as well as the special effects by Tom Savini.  A caretaker is brutally disfigured after the young campers play a horrible prank on him. Years later, he is released from the hospital (still disfigured from burns) and wreaks havoc at the a neighboring campsite. Why does he come to this particular camp to raise carnage??  See to find out. Some truly splatter scenes follow (i.e. the raft scene).  A MUST SEE for any slasher/splatter fanatic.  And to those who only adore the post SCREAM slashers (Valentine, I Still know...) - a look is deserved at how  slashers should REALLY be done.",1006300800,2,739,5.024590163934426
1191347,5,B0000065N8,"What a great, cheesy 80s slasher flick. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.  When I first saw the Burning, I was only 11 or 12, and I was convinced that the murderer was going to kill me in my sleep.  Friday the 13th didn't keep my up at night--THIS movie did.  After watching it again (and THANK YOU amazon for giving us the unedited, uncut version!), I can see why I was so scared.  The murders are not satiric like they are in Scream and other current movies.  They are unapologetic and violent.  And the raft scene that everyone seems to talk about really is as good as it sounds.  Fingers get snipped off, throats get impaled, bodies fly into the water, and a silhoutted figure continuously raises his garden shears up and down, up and down...  it really is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any slasher flick.",1004659200,6,830,4.3441558441558445

Jason Alexander was great in it!!It started a little slow than got going all at once. Not a bad slasher film at all, very gory and decent acting. This film looked like it had a much bigger budget than Madman did but Madman has been rereleased onto DVD, and this is only avaiable here on VHS. One of the neat things about the film was that it mostly took part in the day time. That is not very common for slasher films that usually depend on the cover of darkness to mask their low budgets. I would recommend this to any horror/slasher fan. My final rating 3 1/2 stars.",1004227200,,757,4.191780821917808

Here is all the elements that made 80's horror so great wrapped in one blood-soaked camp laundry bag.  The effects by splat-maestro Tom Savini are deliscious.  The infamous raft massacre is a watershed moment in the genre.  It's fun.  It's bloody.  It's so 80's.  And what a cast of future stars!  Check this baby out.",1001808000,3,467,4.679012345679013

The movie centers around a widely disliked caretaker named Cropsey, who is burned severely in a horribly gone wrong teenage prank. The caretaker, after being released from the hospital, decides to take his vengeance out on the teens that are staying at the camp. The film is from then on non-stop trills and chills.

1191353,4,B0000065N8,"The Burning, although a carbon clone of F13th, is still an exceptional film. The character of Cropsy is a dark, and frankly gruesome persona. His burns are more realistic than Freddy Krueger's, which makes the look more unsettling. Unfortunately you do not see much of Cropsy until the final 10 mins of the film. (And he meets an unpleasent end.) What also makes this film better than F13th is the characters. Although they can't really act, they are more funny and often more likeable than those in other slasher films. Also, The Burning does not have a string of dullard sequels, which makes this stand out as a cult classic. The Burning, though often dull, is a worthy horror and one that shouldn't be overlooked. Watch out for the notorious raft scene massacre.",996278400,,765,4.7593984962406015

This move has some memorable actors notably the guy who was George Costanza on Seinfeld. The lone male voyeur is also a staple of movies of this time but I forget his name. The WOMEN in this move, some who are YOUNG ADULTS, YOUNG WOMEN, are simply STUNNING. They are so SENSUAL and SEXY. The VIOLENCE and MURDER are kept at discreet level so the viewer is never overwhelmed with MURDER and GORE. This is at least my opinion. I was drawn in to see the George Costanza character/actor in this movie. I stayed to see the sexy women and even the sexy guy who fought off the burned man. All in all this movie is GREAT!!
