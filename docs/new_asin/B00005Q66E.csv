1645116,3,B00005Q66E,"First off, don't expect the quality one would expect with such landmark series such as ""World at War"" or ""The BBC History of WWII;"" nonetheless, Madacy Entertainment has done an acceptable job in colorizing some of the documentary footage contained in this five disc set. If one can overcome objections to ""colorizing"" existing content, the viewer should be able to enjoy an interesting trip thru WWII.

For a modest outlay (I purchased the set for approximately $9.95 at Ross Dress for Less--yes, they do sell DVDs too!), this set covers both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters adequately, and includes ""filler"" excerpts from Frank Capra's ""Why We Fight"" divided among the the five discs. Some of the highlights to this boxed set includes interviews with several British Spitfire pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain and a number of German and American veterans who fought in Monte Cassino, North Africa, and D-Day. As an avid reader of WWII history and the Mediterranean campaign in particular, I found the segments entitled ""The Battle of Malta,"" ""North Africa,"" and ""Monte Cassino"" both absorbing and relatively comprehensive.",1175212800,2,1135,5.168478260869565
1645117,4,B00005Q66E,"Sorry to say to Buddha Dharma, that this is indeed mostly colorized footage. I work with a company doing documentaries and we have footage that was dubbed directly from the National Archives in Washington, D.C. I saw exactly the same shots in this set that are on our dubs in Black & White. If they were available in color, we would have gotten them in color from the National Archives. Also, there was a ""film damage"" filter added. If you look at the DVD's at X2 or X4 speed, watch for the same film scratch, hair, and dirt patterns going by. There is very little color (combat) footage from World War 2. From what I have heard, (I have not researched this and don't know the true facts, but...) the amount of color combat footage from WW2 is in the low (less than 100) hours range. To me the colorized footage is okay, but the box labelling is extremely misleading.",1167955200,2,867,4.425
1645118,4,B00005Q66E,"There are too many ignorant souls out there complaining that the footage in this doco is colorized, it clearly states right on the tin that it is not colorized and that it is restored footage from actual color film that was taken at the time.  Much of which had never been seen before.  Get your facts straight before bad mouthing a product and for god's sake get a clue, footage that old, color or not is bound to show some fading over time, of course the color is not that good in some of it, color film was extremely new then.",1126742400,7,529,4.227722772277228
1645119,5,B00005Q66E,GREAT SET FOR LITTLE MONEY. 5 DVDS FOR ABOUT $20. SOMEONE COMPLAINED OF COLORIZED FOOTAGE. SO WHAT. THIS WAS NOT FILMED WHEN COLOR FILM WAS UNIVERSALLY USED. ENJOY WHAT IS PRESENTED. IF YOU EXPECT FOOTAGE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A MOVIE THEATRE TRY AGAIN. IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME OLD B&W FOOTAGE WITH A LITTLE LIFE BREATHED INTO YOU GOT TO GET THIS.,1115683200,3,347,4.3538461538461535
1645120,1,B00005Q66E,I had high hopes for this set but can't recommend it for 2 reasons. First the colorized footage is poorly done. If it had been done better it would have been OK but the color values are often incorrect and very basic with poor shading and depth of detail. The second reason is that the DVD's are very short in length. All this material could have probably been put in a 2 Disc set in one keep case. Multiple DVD's is a common practice to make the consumer believe they are getting their moneys worth.,1105056000,8,500,4.273684210526316
1645121,4,B00005Q66E,"This solid set, which can be found for $20 or lower in many retail outlets, is a bargain for the price, with over 7 1/2 hours of material and a fairly good, if low budget, presentation. The five discs included take you through most of the major events of both the European and Pacific campaigns, using a relatively informative narrator, occasional interview clips from historians and veterans, and actual World War II footage to bring us through the invasion of Poland, Singapore and Pearl Harbor, Guadalcanal, D-Day and much more.
The actual World War II footage that drives these documentaries forward is the centerpiece of the set. Pulling from sources both battered and crisp, the footage is edited fairly well, setting the scene for the conflict being documented. While the packaging boasts ""in color,"" the truth is about 30 to 40 percent of this is colorized black and white footage (the first few documentaries on the first disc might be as high as 50 to 60 percent). Disappointing, but, save for much of the footage on the first disc (which has poorer colorization than the rest), it's not a terrible color job. When set next to the often shoddy color footage of the era, it's often not even noticeable, especially in the Pacific footage.
Newsreels, propaganda films and poster galleries supplement each disc. If you find the set for under $20, a history buff would almost find the price worth it for the newsreels alone. These are interesting, informative, and really pull you back to the period.
These aren't high-budget, top of the line documentaries, but rest assured this isn't ""you get what you paid for,"" either. This set (assuming you can find it for the price mentioned above) is a bang-for-your-buck bargain that any World War II buff will enjoy.
Four out of Five stars for the incredible value; three out of five if you have to pay $30 or more.",1078531200,12,1863,4.788819875776397
1645122,1,B00005Q66E,"I bought this from a local retailer and after watching the beginning of the first DVD, I took it right back and got a refund. Why? First of all, I don't like being taken and fooled into buying something that isn't what it claims to be. I read the outside of the packaging to detect anything that implies it was ""colorized"" from black & white footage. On the contrary, the box states it is ""vintage COLOR footage."" No hint of 'colorization.' Well think again....
All it is is reworked b & w footage with pale, lifeless color added to the film, and poorly done at that. Immediately detectable. Listen folks, I don't care if it's got good war footage or not - I don't know because I only watched a minimal amount for the reasons explained above. What I have a problem with is the deceptive technique and wording used to fool people into buying the product -- that is enough reason NOT to blow your money on it! If it's colorized via computer, then it needs to honestly and clearly STATE THAT. Enough said.",1061769600,25,1002,4.421621621621622

1645124,3,B00005Q66E,"This is a good set overall, but the quality is uneven. Some of the footage is good original color film. However, some is either poor quality color because of the age of the original film or it may be colorized; I'm not sure. There is also a fair amount of repetition, slightly disguised by using zoom-in/out and mirror images. Whether colorized or not, I think the color adds to the realism and am glad I came across this. I still rate ""World War II the Lost Color Archive"" the best of this type followed closely by ""World War II in Color, the British Story"" and ""World War II in Color""",1006128000,11,586,4.336363636363636

I don't know how they did it but all the footage are in COLOR!! Approximately 7 hours 30 minutes.

7949795,4,B00005Q66E,I ordered this thinking it was another series I had seen years ago. I was disappointed in that I had made a mistake but I am not unhappy with it and have no qualms about having it.,1462665600,,180,3.891891891891892
7949796,2,B00005Q66E,"I watched Dunkirk and part of Norway on the first DVD. Then I turned it off. The narrator was a bit sensational at times, and boring at other times. The music didn't fit. The footage is not in color; instead, it is black-and-white footage that has been colorized. They jumped from one battle to another without telling the full story of the war.

What led up to WWII?  How did WWII start?  What role did Russia play? None of these questions are answered. And why would they start a 5-DVD set with Dunkirk? Is that where the war started? Then they skip to Norway. Why? What about Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland? Those countries are only mentioned briefly. It makes no sense. And it gives people a very convoluted impression of the war.

This reminds me of the kind of WWII documentaries that some of teachers used to show kids in elementary school or high school...the kind of documentaries where I do not learn about the war at all...instead, I just get glimpses of certain war events with limited explanation. It's the kind of documentary that leaves kids confused about WWII, not wanting to learn more.

If you are a glutton for punishment and still want to buy this DVD set, then you may also be interested in another version of this DVD set on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWII-Battlefront-Tin-Can-Collection/dp/B00067Z2AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWII Battlefront (Tin Can Collection)</a>. However, I recommend that you rent it before buying it.

There are several WWII documentaries that are much better than this one. Want to know what they are?

7949798,1,B00005Q66E,"You might as well throw this collection in the trash as there is absolutely no mention of the Eastern Front or Russia in the entire series.  I'd really like to know why this ""mistake"" was made. Too much work for the greedy producers? Why judge or comment on what they decided was WW2 and what wasn't?  Pure junk!

7949800,4,B00005Q66E,"Some people are blowing this out of proportion with their reviews. It's 10 or 15 bucks for 7 hours of footage, and it tells you what you're going to get in the description. I, for one, don't really care that the footage is colorized - in fact I prefer it. If I want B&W footage I can find that any time, getting a general idea of how it really looked based on the colorization is kind of cool.

There is narration on parts and you can learn things, of course, but mostly you're buying it to see war footage in color and that's about it, right? So for what it is and the price, I can't say I regret having bought it at all. I've watched a lot of History channel and I still haven't seen most of this footage here - so that was nice. The newsreels, propaganda clips and interviews of veterans are pretty cool too. I just wish there were more combat footage.",1229472000,,855,4.150602409638554
7949801,1,B00005Q66E,"I've been *trying* to watch this, but every time I try I have to hit ""Stop"" on the remote before too long. I'm onto the third disk after about 3 months.

Wade pretty much took the words right out of my mouth, but did it better.

The packaging is deceptive, but I knew that from the get-go. There probably isn't 5 DVDs worth of color WWII footage to begin with! But what I wasn't prepared for, but should have been, is that the job of colorizing would be butchered to the point of painful to watch.

Beyond the color however, is basically a Cliff Note's version of WWII. I try to get beyond the hatchet job on the color and instead focus on listening to the content, but the content is so busy and each topic is covered so briefly I feel like I'm watching a cross between Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Robotron, but with even less substance. When the lack of historic content again comes to the forefront of my consciousness, I am left with nothing else but to return my focus to the hatchet job on the color. While watching this I often recognize footage from other productions that were presented in the original grayscale, and miss seeing them presented that way.

Then I hit ""Stop"" and return this failure to my selves & drawers of my DVD collection. Actually, now that I have written this I will be adding it to my next load of things heading for donation to the thrift shop. Although I have reservations with that. If I want someone to gain knowledge about WWII, I would recommend many other productions and sources and warn them of this waste of time.

Basically, the colorizing is just lipstick on a pig. Except this lipstick is blue and not an inviting color like red.",1212105600,7,1679,4.4207119741100325
7949802,4,B00005Q66E,This is not a BBC quality DVD package but well worth the money. It's educational and I have watched it a few times already. This is a TV program and a pretty good one. I like it.,1199145600,,178,3.8378378378378377
7949803,1,B00005Q66E,"Just a couple of hours ago I would have thought it impossible to really screw up a World War II documentary to the point of it being unwatchable. Well, after less than five minutes of this abomination I stand corrected. To say that this set is ""in color"" with ""never-before-seen"" footage may be technically true, but it is also completely disingenuous. This set consists predominantly (if not entirely, I'm not watching any more of it to find out) of COLORIZED black-and-white footage (poorly and obviously colorized at that) that has never been seen before because no one has had the audacity to butcher perfectly good black-and-white film like this before. Adding insult to injury is the fact that underneath all of the ridiculously unnatural looking color is some pretty good and interesting footage. I'm really almost at a loss for words; this hatchet job on history was so poorly conceived, so poorly done, and just so very unnecessary that it boggles the mind as to why it was done in the first place. To ruin otherwise good material just to be able to sell it as being ""in color"" is shameful and pathetic. I got this for $7.95 mere hours ago and tomorrow I am going to get that $7.95 back. I wouldn't keep this if I had gotten it free in the mail. Just awful. What were they thinking?",1198108800,10,1291,4.6173913043478265
7949804,1,B00005Q66E,"I bought it to educate my kids about the history and events of WWII. This set fails miserably. It's mostly unexciting footage with many repeating scenes and many times there is clearly no connection between the battles covered and the footage.

The storytelling is abysmal and the pictures are unexciting.",1178496000,6,305,5.1
