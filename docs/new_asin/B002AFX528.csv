WHAT DOES THE IE MOMMY THINK?:

Barney is one of those characters who you can trust to teach your children the benefit of goodness, kindness, friendship and loyalty.

The IE Twins were very excited about the concept of the Sharing is Caring Video as we recently just took a lot of items to donate to a local Fireman's event.

The behaviour displayed by Baby Bop as she reluctantly (initially) did not want to part with her precious treasures demonstrated to the girls the benefit of selflessness as Baby Bop eventually realized that sharing was truly showing you cared.

Barney explains concepts like ""being a good neighbor"", ""sharing"" and ""listening"" in a way that toddlers and bigger kids can understand.

Sharing is Caring is a great video to introduce to your child to reinforce what we, as parents, try to teach them daily.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Sharing-Is-Caring/dp/B002AFX528/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney: Sharing Is Caring!</a>",1251331200,5,1025,5.717105263157895
