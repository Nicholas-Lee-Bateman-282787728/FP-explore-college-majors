7813055,3,6301618270,"The other reviews talk of this film being campy, but it isn't. The film is fairly serious in its intent. 3 women escape from a mental asylum after their psychologist dies determined to resurrect him. In the mix is a man hunting with his son who is token hostage by the women who believe him to be their doctor resurrected. The film is well cast, well acted and tries to examine the human issues surrounding all of the main players involved. It's downfall is that the film tries to tackle too much and in the process, their isn't a streamlined plot. Lots of interesting ideas in search of a guiding principal.",1429488000,,608,4.486486486486487

7813057,4,6301618270,"I love cheesy horror films from the 70's and 80's and this one does not disappoint in any way. Shelley Winters is magnificent as the Witch who heads up a trip of escaped mental patients to her dilapidated home in the woods where they try to conjure up the spirit of their dead psychiatrist. There were so many witchcraft related films made between the 70's and 80's and I have always counted this one among my favorites. It is corny, silly, and magnificently ridiculous. I hope you enjoy it.",1265846400,2,491,4.52808988764045
