8247309,5,B0012QE4DU,"OLD TECHNOLOGY VIDEO, BUT IT SHOWS JEFF COOPERS KNOWLEDGE. PROBABLY THE BEST SOURCE OF INFO FOR HANDGUN DEFENSE, STRESSES MENTAL PREPERATION.",1456617600,,141,5.761904761904762
8247310,5,B0012QE4DU,"I'm glad I bought it, I've watched it several times already, but, if you're not a Cooper fan, you might want to save your money...if you are, it's a good one.",1428624000,,158,4.129032258064516
8247311,5,B0012QE4DU,"Great DVD's of the accepted father of ""the Modern Technique"" of the pistol.",1428105600,,75,4.846153846153846
8247312,5,B0012QE4DU,"These are the original VHS format videos tranferred to DVD.  They will give you the insight that Jrff Cooper gave to all his students then that still works today.  If you love the 1911 and pistol fighting technics, this is a must get item.",1353888000,,239,4.409090909090909
8247313,5,B0012QE4DU,"This DVD set is copied over from tapes and dates back over a decade. Video quality isn't state of the art, but we buy it for the content, not the image. However, Cooper is the master and his work is the basis of all current quality defensive firearms courses. There are a lot of quality video courses available, but your collection isn't complete without Jeff Cooper's ""Defensive Pistolcraft"". Would buy again.",1322092800,3,410,4.788732394366197
8247314,5,B0012QE4DU,"If you are at all interested in the study of pistolcraft, this is a must.  It's copied over from the original VCR so there are a few issues, but generally it's clear.  It's a little hokey in spots and very centered on the 1911, but Cooper was a master and this is well worth the time and money.",1320278400,,294,4.051724137931035
8247315,5,B0012QE4DU,"I had this series in VHS a number of years back and lost it somehow during a move to another state.  I am thrilled to have it now in DVD format.  If anyone is looking for good instruction on defensive pistol craft, this four part series is hard to beat.  It is very clear and useful information for anyone carrying a handgun either open or concealed.

The DVDs are good quality copies of the tapes and look somewhat 1980s.  The information is all there and usable though.  The original VHS tapes were of a marginal quality as I recall but, still, it's really a very minor issue. I remember wanting to adjust tracking at times on the VHS tapes and I found myself going through the same type of thought process with the DVD on a couple of occasions.  That is a very minor issue though and it never reaches a point where the video is not viewable.  It's just not 21st Century Fox movie quality copy.

The instruction given highly outweighs any perceived video quality issues.

Highly recommended.",1305072000,,993,4.4972067039106145
8247316,4,B0012QE4DU,"The dvd quality is mediocre and some of the music from the 80s is cheesy and made me chuckle, but there is no better place to start learning about defensive pistol shooting. Jeff Cooper was a great man and his contributions will be remembered as long as our republic endures.",1297987200,4,275,4.52
