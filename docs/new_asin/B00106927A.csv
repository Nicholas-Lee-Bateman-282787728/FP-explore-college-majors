8237251,3,B00106927A,"""China White"" is a Hong Kong gangster flick, shot mainly in Amsterdam, and featuring a curious cast. There's Russell Wong, mainly known for his work in American pictures but here is graduating from his early HK rom-coms. There's Steven Vincent Leigh, who'd become a regular in American low-budget action flicks but had never done a HK movie and never would again. Similarly, Billy Drago walks onto this Eastern production as though it was any old film and then slides out, never to return to this style of movie again. It's a fun hodge-podge, and the film is interesting enough to hold your attention, but the deficit of martial arts action that most of us expect out of Wong and Leigh weighs heavily on this one's potential and my rating.

The story: when the godfather of a Triad syndicate in Amsterdam is killed, his protgs Bobby (Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Must-Die/dp/B00003CXGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo Must Die</a>) and Danny (Leigh,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sword-of-Honor/dp/B000FGFBLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sword of Honor</a>) assume control and initiate a quest for vengeance...all while an Italian boss (Drago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Untouchables/dp/B00029NKU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Untouchables</a>) attempts to move in on their territory, closely pursued by Interpol.

Regardless of what it sounds like, this is a pretty streamlined plot for a Hong Kong production. Even with the inclusion of a lengthy flashback segment that was cut from overseas versions of the flick (I saw the original Hong Kong release), this is one of the few films of its style and budget that knows exactly what it wants to do. It's a gangster story with a love angle, plain and simple, and I am glad that this one avoids the comedy or sci-fi detours of more ambitious fare from this time. It's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B0018CMJSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>, but it does present a decent character study of a sudden rise to power. It doesn't make the most of its unique setting or elaborate how the Triad drug trade differs at all in the Netherlands from any other country, but its unique city is to the cinematographer's benefit and makes for some beautiful shots...not to mention a cool stunt wherein a character rides a falling ladder across an urban canal.

While there is a decent helping of impressive stuntwork like that, this clearly isn't a pure action film, much to my chagrin given the talents of its two leading men. There are three fairly sizeable shootouts, shot well enough, but they're not nearly so cool as to make you abandon John Woo's work. They're there to advance the story, never to make you say ""Wow, that's cool!"" I can only imagine how director Ronny Yu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-with-White-Hair/dp/630502054X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride with White Hair</a>) restrained himself to limit the number of fight scenes, but sure enough, he ends up with only three very quick brawls. Steven Leigh takes center stage for these, but the only fight of any kind of substance is an unimaginative match with henchwoman Saskia van Rijswijk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer/dp/B000066C7X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer</a>). Again, I'll accept that martial arts were never meant to be the focus of this one, but if the filmmakers had time for such quick detours, why not make them just a bit more enjoyable?

Dramatically/technically, the movie offers an odd but pleasing concession: while the Cantonese dialogue is obviously dubbed in the traditional Hong Kong manner, the English dialogue (of which there is a lot) seems to have been recorded on the set and remains in the movie. The result of this is that the performance of a guy like Billy Drago is unhindered and he's allowed to soundly steal every single scene he's in, unchecked by a goofy voiceover. Interpol agent/love interest Lisa Schrage (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hello-Mary-Lou-Prom-Night-II/dp/B0013K2ZFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II</a>) also benefits from this a lot in her scenes with Russell Wong, who performs no karate here but delivers a sound acting performance.

I think that fans of Wong will appreciate this more than fans of Leigh, but first and foremost, this is  a gangster flick. Approach it as such to get the most enjoyment from it.",1407024000,2,4683,5.961309523809524
