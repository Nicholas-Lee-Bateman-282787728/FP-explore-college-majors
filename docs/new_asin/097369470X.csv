173873,5,097369470X,"Before I watched this documentry I never heard about 'Peak Oil' and it's implications for our future. I had bought into the common perception that most of us have that oil is resource that possibly may run out sometime in the future but long after my lifetime and my children's lifetime, and that before it does start running out some magical breakthrough will be made in alternative energy sources such as hydrogen fuel cells in time to save the day for our modern lifestyles. But this documentry shook the foundations of my perceptions. I was shocked by the reality that oil is a limited resource that will probably start running low within our lifetimes and also by the extent that our modern lifestyles depends on it. And what is almost more more disturbing is that I had to learn about it for the first time from this documentry - why is information of this importance and magnitude not in the headlines of our media? This is important information that everyone who is a consumer of oil/energy needs to know (that's most of us in this world with maybe the exception of a few of the remaining primitive tribes left in the world these days). For your own sake and the sake of your children you need to watch this documentry, you need to get all your friends to watch it. Only when the majority of us are aware of of this grave problem facing mankind will there be any chance of taking action to save us form the doom that this documentry predicts is in store for us. This is a gripping documentry that will change the way you think about the world we live in today.",1121212800,76,1568,4.466898954703833

I had forgotten about those long ago days during the 1950s when almost everything seemed so inexpensive especially gasoline. I started to drive my 56 Chevy in 1964 when gas was 19 cents per gallon and all my friends were buying cars and we drove every where, every day, without ever knowing we were burning up a non-renewable resource. This DVD opened my mind to change my life style and to learn a more green life-style.

173881,2,097369470X,"Very basic program.  Somewhat geared to lower level thinking.  Turns out to be tome for city planning instead of addressing the major problem, end of oil culture.  Did not really enjoy it.",1277337600,2,188,4.8125
173882,4,097369470X,"Though there are scattered moments throughout this work - particularly towards the end, where some of the talking heads who give the bulk of the documentary's information do offer some doable solutions and ideas to break out of our current problems - most of this shortish, well-made but narrowly focused film paints a gloomy forcast for the future of industrialized societies, particularly in North America.

Look carefully at the title, and be advised that the second part of it - ""Oil Deplation and the Collapse of the American Dream"" is the more relevant focus here.  The beginning of the film does go into some detail about the rise of the suburbs, but, like many populist documentaries coming from a liberal point of view, the film generally wants to lay the blame for the increase of sprawl almost entirely at the feet of oil and car companies, politicians, and advertisers - not on the consumers who made the choices, however influenced they may have been.  Much of the film seems to be an exhortation along the lines of ""you were duped into thinking you wanted this soulless life - break out of it now, it'll be too late soon""!  Even though I'm sure that's not completely untrue - and I'm simplifying a bit - it's frustrating that neither the filmmakers nor any of their interviewees - experts on the petroleum industry, urbanism, sociology - want to delve very far into the psychology of what actually does make suburbs attractive to many people.  James Howard Kunstler, the social critic who is the most present, and most entertaining voice here, seems particularly vitriolic in his scorn for the whole suburban concept - the worst of both the worlds of the city and country, to him.  What, are people just that stupid then?  Perhaps so - but this isn't a very useful selling point if one wants to get this film seen by more than the already-receptive.

This is not to say that the film doesn't offer some valuable information; I consider myself only slightly knowledgeable about the subject, and was fascinated to learn just how hard the US government in particular pushed the postwar housing boom, for example, and Kunstler's little aside about how the suburbs are often named after the natural environments they've wiped out (""Heron Springs"", ""Oak Bluffs"", etc) is one of many pithy but right-on bits that go a long way to showing how artificial and blinkered the whole suburban myth can be.  But most of the film is devoted to the bleakness of the peak oil concept, and the seeming dark ages that will fall afterwards, and here again the filmmakers don't go far enough.  Nothing can replace gasoline, the internal combustion engine, we're told more than once - but we're give no evidence and no real discussion - just ""oh, when gas is $10 a gallon we'll have to come up with a different - and more difficult - way of life"".  These people seem to be rationalists - but they aren't looking deeply enough, or showing a rationalist like me why the alternatives aren't there or won't work.  Saying we're doomed because solar, wind and nuclear don't cut it (and without really telling us why they don't in any detail) isn't really proving their point.

Still all in all, a worthwhile film which at the very least does offer up some avenues for further exploration for those of us interested in the issues of urban and landscape planning and our energy future.  And the disc is enlivened a great deal by the filmmakers' commentary track, and the addition of two vintage promotional/industrial shorts from 1956-7:

Redbook Magazine's IN THE SUBURBS, a rather hilarious push for both the glories of suburban life (which seems essentially to stress the value of conformity) and the magazine, ""the only magazine for young adults""

DESTINATION EARTH, a really poorly animated short in which a Martian explorer lands on Earth to determine the kind of fuel we use in our vehicles and comes back with gushing praise about the glories of oil.",1258070400,2,3941,4.7820324005891015

173884,5,097369470X,"I am sorry to say that I knew about the topic of this film long ago, but could not address the issue with friends in the coherent way in which this video presentes it. I am now trying to spread what I have learned anew from this film among the people that I know, but without the feedback that I expected. It seems that few people wish to acknowledge what is presented here. It seems that everybody is so afraid of the current world financial crisis, that they belive that our poblems only radiate from poor economic choices, and are not related to excessive energy use, and the dependency on the private automobile for fast, and easy transportation needs.",1237248000,4,656,4.5210084033613445
173885,5,097369470X,"After watching this video last year, I did extensive follow-up research on this subject, both through the internet and from book sources (I'm a college professor, by the way).  There are several good websites and dozens of recently published books now available on the topic (available right here on Amazon.com).  All the research I did fully confirms the central viewpoints expressed in this video: that we have already reached, or are near to reaching, a world wide peak in oil production, which means that the growing demand for oil will not be able to be met by the declining supply; and that this condition will progressively worsen over the next 5-10 years.  Further, we are unprepared to meet the challenges this condition will create on our economy and lifestyle, because our entire society is based around cheap, easily available oil supplies. What's more, the events of the past several months during 2008 are eerily forecast in the film, which was released in 2004, potentially confirming its predictions about the impact of rising oil prices on the economy.

The film includes several acknowledged experts in the filed.  One of the most notable is Matthew Simmons, who was a principle energy advisor to the Bush administration.  He is an internationally known expert on peak oil and author of the book, ""Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy.""  Part of what makes this significant, is the fact that the Bush administration had to be aware of the issues surrounding peak oil due to this connection, since Mathew Simmons is such an outspoken proponent of it.  Yet they never discussed it in public.  But they did invade Iraq, known to have one of the largest oil reserves in the world.  Its not hard to put two-and-two together.

What is unfortunate and truly unbelievable, is the fact that so few people are aware of this issue, considering the potential impact it will enviably have on our society.  The film does address the lack of media attention to the subject, but its amazing that five years later, the public awareness has changed little and this is still one of the only decent films on the subject.  As a documentary it is occasionally a little repetitious and preachy, but considering the importance of the issue, it's justified.  And the film is certainly still as relevant as ever.

For those interested, there is a follow-up sequel called, ESCAPE FROM SUBURBIA.  This film, released in 2007, gives both an updated perspective on peak oil and focuses on ways of dealing with the potential crisis.  It has a more positive perspective, for those who may be put off by too much doom and gloom.

As to the potential coming crisis itself.  There is really no debate about if it will happen.  The only debate is when it will happen and how off-guard we will be when it does.  Quite, frankly, I think its already started.",1236902400,6,2873,4.810590631364562

173889,5,097369470X,"When I bought this video, I knew almost nothing about the subject of Peak Oil.  The DVD was a disturbing, eye-opening look at a subject with no real up side and a great introduction to the topic.  Some have panned this video as ""one-sided"" and ""humorless"" but I found it to be absolutely engrossing.

The DVD presents in layman's terms the basics of the peak oil hypothesis, describes the expected effects of the coming decline in oil production, and explains why various alternative energies that are widely expected to  replace oil and save us from economic collapse simply won't.  The best part is that the people featured on the video are not hippies holding up signs on a street corner.  They are educated, professional people -- many of them industry insiders.

The DVD, in short, explains that oil is a finite resource whose production follows a bell-shaped curve, with a ""peak"" at the point where the greatest amount of oil is produced in a single year.  Oil production peaked in the U.S. in 1970 and has declined ever since.  A man named M. King Hubbert predicted this peak years in advance.  Now, experts using Hubbert's ideas are predicting that world oil production will also peak soon, if it hasn't already.  From then on, world oil production will decline more or less steadily year after year.

This is scary given the U.S.'s extensive dependence on oil for transportation, heating, food production, manufacturing, and a host of other things.  Couple that with growing demand for oil by developing nations like India and China and you have a recipe for political tension, war, and possibly even social collapse.

None of the usual alternative energies like wind, solar, hydroelectric, natural gas, nuclear, ethanol, hydrogen, or biodiesel are potential replacements for oil.  Most depend on petroleum for their manufacture and/or operation.  Some actually consume more energy to produce than they provide.  Others simply don't provide enough energy efficiently and reliably enough to substitute for oil.  And most would require a complete rebuilding of our current energy infrastructure at tremendous cost to scale up to the present size of our oil-based infrastructure.  There is no fuel on the horizon at present that can replace oil and ""run what we're currently running"" on oil.

That necessarily leads to the conclusion that we are all going to have to consume less and less energy as the years go by.  It also means that the global economy will necessarily contract because it is impossible to continue growing forever economically while simultaneously reducing energy consumption year after year.  At some point, it will become impossible to maintain our present way of life, a way of life predicated on cheap, abundant energy and extreme mobility by automobile.

Though the DVD did not discuss much about what can be done to ameliorate the impact of declining oil production, I personally feel that extreme conservation efforts, particularly in the manufacture of highly efficient automobiles, will delay a world oil crisis for some time.  The U.S. currently wastes so much energy that widespread conservation measures could probably extend the practicable life of our oil-based economy for some years--but not forever.  At some point conservation will no longer work.  Oil prices will rise until few people can afford to buy gasoline and consume it by the tankload.  That will be the end of transportation as we know it today:  the end of suburbia.  After that, the world will undergo a steady regression, as the DVD explains, to probably an agrarian rather than an industrial society.

While some may find this DVD appalling and depressing, I actually feel it describes a far better world, ultimately; a world much like that of the early native Americans or like that which Thomas Jefferson envisioned peopled by yeoman farmers.  Even the Bible foretells a world where every man sits under his vine and under his fig tree in peace and contentment.",1218326400,4,3972,5.04601226993865
173890,5,097369470X,I first rented The End of Suburbia from Net Flex.  I watched it three times in the same evening and then went to Amazon and bought it at once.  I have invited friends to my place to watch and they all have enjoyed the film.  It is a must have in any collection.  Ron Jennings,1217203200,,275,3.9454545454545453
173891,3,097369470X,"Like so many other who posted reviews, I don't dispute that the lifestyle that characterized ""average"" America from about 1946 until the early 2000's is very likely to pass on and be replaced by some kind of a post-gasoline lifestyle.  But that is not necessarily a reason for panic, or even for pessimism.  Nor is it a reason to define the suburban lifestyle ""experiment"" as a failure.

The documentary assumes that American's are so rigidly wedded to the suburban model that we can not adjust to a new one.  Life through the ages has always been fluid, and anyone familiar with American history can see that the nation and its culture have had to frequently readjust to a new reality after a certain lifestyle has finsihed its course.  The closing of the frontier in the 1890's and with it the easy acces to free or cheap farmland was supposed to mark the end of American dynamism and and growth, but Americans responded by turning their energies to developing a new lifestyle centered on the town and city.  50 years later, new problems (Depression and war) and new technologies (automobiles) brought about an new lifestyle in which the small towns and urban centers dwindled and suffered while the suburbs boomed.

The suburban lifestyle should not be judged a failure simply because it's time is starting to pass.  It was in fact a very successful living arrangement while it lasted.

Now that it is nearing the end of its usefullness, there is no reason to believe that society will not adapt to the new realities.  As people may choose to live in places where they can easily walk or ride public transport to transact their daily businesses, we could end up seeing a new revitalization of  small town America's main streets as well as the larger city centers.  Big sprawling strip malls may be replaced once again with mom and pop corner stores in the cities, and main street shops in the small towns.

In short, suburbia was fun while it lasted, but what comes after it may be better.  There is no reason to assume the worst.  Americans may just start dreaming a new dream.

Of course the worst case scenarios are possible, but they are not the only possible scenarios.",1213833600,,2177,4.689473684210526

By  Sarah Anne Edwards""

I am amazed there are so few reviews of this DVD. It was the feature at a conference I attended three years ago and watching it was an eye-opening, life-changing event. Yes, we knew about the drawbacks of sprawl and its effects on the environment. Yada, yada. What we didn't know about was that our entire ""non-negotiable"" American way of life is perched on, if not already tipping over, the edge of collapse in the not so distant future as a result of world-wide fossil fuel depletion, among other things. The implications of this well-documented DVD affect nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Every American needs to see this. Few if any will like it. Many will discount it. But hopefully most of us will wake-up and realize that we need to get real busy, real fast safeguarding our own personal circumstances and electing officials at all levels of government who recognize the impending crises we face and have the courage to take needed action to address it. Granted the DVD goes on a bit long on the same points and verges occasionally into unnecessary political commentary. But what is being laid out here bears repeating and is not a political issue. It is a survival issue. Over the past 3 years my husband and I have made many decisions about our careers, finances, lifestyle choices, and every one has been influenced by what we learned from watching this documentary. If only we'd seen it a couple of years earlier we wouldn't be trying to compensate now for decisions we made before we knew what was at stake.",1205798400,33,1592,4.723021582733813
173894,4,097369470X,I had read a review of this DVD before it was on sale in the shops.  I still have not found it in the shops.  It answered a lot of questions about the use of bio fuels and other forms of energy that are also not sustainable if we want to continue living the way we do at present.  It could well help make decisions on where we live in the future and certainly on the use of petrol driven cars.  It reinforced my view of wasteful use of land for housing that takes people a long way from services and does not foster a sense of community.  I live in New Zealand and we are big users of fossil fuels.,1202515200,7,598,3.909090909090909
173895,2,097369470X,"I am not sorry I watched this; it was very thought provoking and I am still thinking about some of the points it raised. The problem I have with the film, however, is that it is so profoundly negative and thoroughly one-sided. The people being interviewed all shared identical political beliefs, economic beliefs, and future predictions. Basically, everyone interviewed was unanimous that America is headed for doom and gloom because of the issues we are going to face. Call me an optimist--or call me something worse if you like--but I have much more faith in the American people. I do, for the most, agree with the predictions that life as we know it will be radically altered in the decades to come. I fundamentally disagree that Americans are going to panic, destroy each other, and otherwise become violent and/or helpless. I think we will pull together, create a new kind of community and way of life, and things will be even better than before. I truly do believe this. I simply have too much faith in the American people to believe that we are not capable of making lemonade from lemons. Unfortunately, everyone in this documentary not only predicts nothing but negativity on the horizon, but there seems to be a sick sort of gleam in their eye of glee when they make these predictions, almost as if they want it to happen and/or think we deserve it. This is major flaw in this documentary that takes it from a 4/5 to a 2/5. Hopefully in the ""new America"" that these commentators speak of there will be a return to making objective documentaries. Remember those? Pretty much, well, every documentary ever made up until a few years ago when documentaries became about espousing a single opinion and not simply ""documenting"" what is going on.",1201305600,3,1748,4.753289473684211
173896,2,097369470X,"It's thought provoking and eye opening, but ultimately too preachy and one-sided. This film lacks any of the humor, charm or heart of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" or Michael Moore docs (all of which I love). I grew tired of the film relying so much on one interviewee, James Howard Kunstler. His over-the-top scary sound bites grew dull and overly negative. In fact, the film needed a broader range of people to interview.

They are all humorless sour-faced prophets of doom that have nothing better than to scold you, the public.

In a time of growing concern for future energy shortages, this documentary approaches the subject by suggesting that our suburban way of life - suburban sprawl, extended commutes, and even the accessibility of household merchandise - is soon coming to an end.  Alternative fuel sources are flawed.  Hydrogen requires electricity for conversion; Biodiesel requires farmland, which continues to become more costly to maintain.  By conserving fuel and shifting to urban revitalization, we can help reduce some of the negative impacts of living in an oil-based economy.

For those of you hot on the issue of peak oil, this documentary will be more of the same.  It is still an interesting and informative film, albeit biased in that it presents only one point of view.

Here's the upside:

A brief but very interesting history of how suburbs came to exist.

A ray of hope in ""new urbanization"".

A really cool short cartoon called ""Destination Earth"".  It was way more entertaining than the documentary itself.

One ironic observation that made me laugh.  Yes, it really does seem that housing developments are named after what they destroyed in order to build the houses.  Ha ha.

Now the downside:

A lot of cliche and patronizing file footage of typical suburbanites of the WWII generation.  What were they thinking?  (Maybe, ""hey, we survived the great depression and saved the world from fascism and now we'd like to have a nice little home and raise a family."")

Continual alternating between file footage of suburban life and talking heads of haggard looking academics and authors I've never heard of saying over and over things like: this surbia can't last; it's doomed; it's awful anyway; they're gonna get it; and on and on and on.  I thought to myself that some of these guys seem to actually want the United States to fail as a nation and be reduced to subsistance living.

Typical cliche attack on those ""neocons"" who just want to fight an endless war to keep this awful suburban lifestyle going.  It's all just that simple.

Anyway, it's no surprise to me that gasoline keeps going up in price, and I'm sure there are some unpleasent times ahead, but I have faith that we as a culture will adjust when the time comes.  Well, back to my empty suburban lifestyle.",1189987200,7,1669,4.696551724137931

What amazes me is that the ""experts"" in the show ignore the fact that the US has two hundred years of coal reserves (more to be discovered). Sure it is ""dirty"" but will do the job just like natural gas. Electricity to homes and business are not the issue. Gasoline and Oil are. The documentary also missed the point as energy prices go up alternative life style changes will happen such as people working from home. One of the experts indicated that he was a writer. Well I think he can write from anyplace in the world and get the job done. The US has financialized its economy our manufacturing capability is minimal. The majority of jobs today are about services that could in fact be done over the phone. The experts forgot a fundamental law of economics that still in place today Adam Smith ""The invisible hand"" the market will have an immediate impact on supply since people will look for alternative and use less. The proof the reaction to the ""Oil Shock"" of the 70's resulting in lower demand and for the first time in history lower production of oil.  Dismissing alternative fuels was another big mistake; history graveyards are filled with nay Sayers on how something is impossible like going to the moon, breaking the sound barrier etc.  Oil is a miracle of nature and its energy output is incredible, today nothing can touch it, but the point is not to replace 100% but through a combination of alternative additives such as ethanol or others to extend the life and supply of oil until the new alternative has taken over.

173900,4,097369470X,"I won't summarize what this film is about because everyone else already did.  I think it is very useful material and it does a good job at explaining how our current standard of living was built on the abundance of cheap oil and the assumption that cheap oil would last forever. The film also does a good job at challenging the rationality of these notions.  That's the informative and analytical part of the film, and it is really good.

As for possible solutions and predicting the future (the thought-provoking part), the predicted scenarios may be debatable, but bringing up some possibilities is necessary for the film to have a conclusion.  Personally, I think coal is dismissed too quickly in the film because of the polluting implications, but that sounds like too rational a reason to dismiss coal.  Already we have many congressmen from coal-rich states pushing for pro-coal legislation.  Americans will do anything it takes to preserve their way of life... That will come first, and the environment (e.g. all the pollution associated to using coal as the main source of energy) will come second.  That is my own prediction, anyway, and it is as debatable as the various scenarios advanced in the film.  Yet, the film is thought-provoking and that's good.

On a side note, I have to agree with some of the previous comments in that bringing up the Iraq war may not have been too clever. I don't intend to discuss whether the arguments put forward are correct or not. That is not my point.  My point is political and pedagogical: The clear political turn the film makes in its las 30 minutes is likely to turn off entire conservative audiences, which include many who need to be convinced about the seriousness of the energy supply problem and the need to think of creative solutions.  It also makes it difficult for those of us who are educators to show the entire film to our students.  Showing a film that features a rally where a sign that reads ""Cheney you are an asshole"" is prominently featured on the screen is just something you can only do very carefully if you are a college professor (especially if you are a college professor in a place where the government is popular.)  That alone would turn off many students and the pedagogical value of the film would be compromised.  But, of course, I can always omit that part.",1183161600,4,2339,4.714987714987715
173901,5,097369470X,"This film is a must see!  As the other reviewers note, this film's basic premise is that we have about hit the ""peak oil"" point (see ""Crude Awakening"" for more depth on this point) at which worldwide oil ""reserves"" are so diminished that they are increasingly expensive to extract (and of lower quality -- we hit this point nationally twenty-five years ago).  We have not come up with safe and viable energy alternatives and therefore energy is going to get progressively much, much more expensive.  (My father grew up in a house, sixty years ago, that had solar water heating -- we just do not seem to be making or be interested in making much progress in sustainable energy production).

Since our way of life is based on cheap energy, the logical conclusion is that our way of life is going to have to change -- radically -- within the next twenty years or so.  Suburbia and long commutes are going to be a inevitable casualty (i.e. sell now if you live there), along with inexpensive food from far away.  The process of outer suburbia's becoming a slum has already begun here in South Florida.  The end of cheap energy would also seem to signal the impending natural death of ""globalization.""

I think that somewhere in the back of our minds we all know that gas is not going to last forever, though we hope that the end will not be soon, and that we need to faster develop alternative sustainable energy.  This film posits that the end is quite near and that we are entirely unprepared for it; then it brings the logical ramifications into jarring focus -- we are and have been enormously and foolishly improvident.  I hope that we act on what seems to be indisputable information ...",1181347200,3,1689,4.5813953488372094
173902,3,097369470X,"American suburbia is not sustainable in its current form for much longer and this documentary makes that abundantly clear. However, it is counter-productive to portray suburbanites as silly, ignorant, wrong, as this DVD constantly does. The fact is that American suburban life is generally pleasant and more desirable than the alternatives of inner-city or rural life. That is why it has persisted and expanded for generations and will continue to do so for as long as possible. One can hardly blame us for hanging on to the comforts of suburbia for as long as we possibly can.

Another criticism is that there is almost no mention of fossil fuel in the form of coal of which we have large domestic reserves and from which we can make any product that currently comes from oil or natural gas  - only at a much greater cost, though of course that would only delay the inevitable. Nuclear-powered electricity is also ignored. It seems the authors believe that the current popular environmental opposition to coal and nukes will persist even when oil and gas supplies run out or become prohibitively expensive. But public and government attitudes will change to be far less environmentally conscious when our basic standards of living (or even survival) are on the line.

173907,5,097369470X,"President George W. Bush recently scolded Americans for being ""addicted to oil."" But most American citizens no longer believe that Bush invaded Iraq because of its weapons of mass destruction, or that he toppled Saddam Hussein's regime because he was linked to the 9/11 and other Islamic terrorists or to free the Iraqis to vote in democratic elections. In a word, the war is about oil. Now comes the documentary movie The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of The American Dream. The movie's title alone can seem to justify Bush's Iraq misadventure. But it doesn't.

Let me digress. In 1951, while attending the sixth grade at P.S. 166 in Astoria, Long Island City, Queens, our science teacher taught us how coal and petroleum had been produced from prehistoric plants and animals far beneath the earth's surface under high pressure during millions of years. She darkly pointed out that because the natural process of producing coal and petroleum can happen on earth only once, whatever is underground must last us forever. When asked how long the oil would last, she replied, ""Another 75 to 100 years."" Coal will last a few years longer.

At the time, 75 to 100 years seemed impossibly far into the distant future. But according to the new documentary movie directed by Gregory Greene, my P.S. 166 teacher's estimate may have been optimistic by nearly a factor of two. With six billion plus people now on earth burning fossil fuels at increasing rates, we've already passed the World Oil Peak -- the maximum possible rate of refining crude petroleum world wide no matter what. Now comes the inevitable decline of fossil fuels as argued by scientists and policy makers in the movie.

The often humorous documentary tends to avoid the heavy doom and gloom of the World Oil Peak theorists, but it sometimes touches on the darker aspects of fossil fuel depletion: specifically, how it impacts on food production. Modern industrial agriculture relies heavily on petroleum for pesticides and natural gas for fertilizer, and also for the energy used in planting, growing, harvesting, irrigating, packaging, processing, and transporting the food. The movie fleetingly visits the energy-intensive process involved in bringing food to supermarkets.

Astoria was in crowded New York City. The suburbs were mythical places far out on Long Island or similarly far north of Manhattan in places with names like Yonkers and Hastings-on-Hudson. But in 1951 it was promised that if we studied hard and worked hard, we could one day get a good job and even buy a house in those mythical places. The official American Dream had become a life in the suburbs, but you needed your own gas-guzzling car to get there, to get around there, and to get back.

Ever since World War II ended, Americans have poured lots of their increasing wealth into suburbia. The 'burbs promised a lot more space than urban living; they were believed to be best places for raising kids and for family life in general -- plus they offered a better chance than cities for upward social and financial mobility. But as suburban sprawl has exploded during the past 50 years, the suburban lifestyle has become embedded in the American consciousness. The ""soccer mom"" is a suburbia invention and now part of American popular culture. By contrast, I used to play ""unsupervised"" stickball with my urban friends in a public park down by the East River. We never worried about an overambitious parent harassing us for striking out. There were only us kids and the beat cop munching on his donut.

Those familiar with World Oil Peak theories and fossil fuel depletion will encounter the usual enfants terribles in this movie. They include Richard Heinberg, Michael Klare, Matthew Simmons, Michael C. Ruppert, Julian Darley, Dr. Colin Campbell, and Kenneth Deffeyes, plus a few others. They each provide valuable information and insights about the coming/present energy crisis and the impact it will be/is having on the lives of people in North America.

The End of Suburbia tells us, the suburban way of life is now considered ""normal."" It also shows the enormous effort needed to maintain this lifestyle. But Kunstler tells us that the suburbs will become ""the slums of the future."" Nevertheless, national foreign policies must continue to aggressively nail down access to the remaining reserves of oil on earth for propping up and maintaining this energy intensive lifestyle. Then the movie clearly emphasizes that suburban living has very poor prospects for the future. All attempts to maintain it will be futile.

Clearly, George W. Bush and his accomplices are prepared to fight bloody wars for control of the world's remaining oil reserves to prop up and maintain the suburban lifestyle. The war in Iraq is obvious evidence of that. Not surprisingly, 60 percent of the world's known reserves are clustered around the Persian Gulf. And Bush and his cohorts are socio-pathologically prepared to decimate the North Slope of Alaska -- our future generations be damned -- for what amounts to a drop in the bucket of the worldwide oil reserves.

Commenting on suburbia, author Richard Heinberg says in the movie, ""It's in everybody's interest to maintain the faade that this way of life is normal . . . and we should continue buying and consuming like there is no tomorrow."" The issue of energy resource depletion is being ignored by the mainstream media because, as Heinberg puts it, ""there's no upside for them. If they decide to tell the people of North America that in fact we are running out of the very resources that fuel economic growth, does that make anybody's stock price go up, except for a few tiny niche companies that make solar panels and wind turbines?""

Basically, director Greene asks this in the movie: As energy prices continue to skyrocket, how will the populations in suburbia react to the collapse of their dreams? Are today's suburbs destined to become the slums of tomorrow, as Kunstler and his cohorts predict? What can be done now by individuals and the government to avoid The End of Suburbia?

Fortunately, the movie does not depress us as it delivers its bad news. Greene's presentation style, with moments of comic relief based on presenting absurd views (all too prevalent in Washington these days), lightens what otherwise could have been a depressing, preachy movie. But this sugarcoated bitter pill is very entertaining, and thus it slips its dire predictions into our psyches before we know it.

173910,3,097369470X,"I watched this movie at a friends house, not knowing exactly what to expect. I had an idea that this would be a Micheal Moore-ish piece of juvenile agitprop, so I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. I have heard Jim Kunstler speak before, so when he first appeared I knew that it would be a work of considerable political savvy.

The documentary details how cheap oil and government planning led Americans away from residences in city factory districts and into the suburbs. This was the birth of the treacly ""American Dream"" of a nice house with a backyard grill, a dog and 2 1/2 kids. The end of cheap oil will lead to the death of the suburbs and the death of that dream.

Although at times the documentary seems ambivalent about the worth of the suburbs, it is clear that the film-makers regard their passing as a bad thing. This is the main problem with the film. The suburbs are the result of heavy middle-class subsidies and intrusive government planning. The very nature of the suburbs ensures that their residents will be heavily dependent on oil comsumption, and the government has heavily subsidized that consumption through road-building projects and an imperialistic foreign policy to ensure access to cheap foreign oil. If these costs were fully internalized by consumers, there is no way the suburbs could exist the way they do. The documentary illustrates this all very clearly, but it nevertheless persists in pieties about the beauty of the suburban American dream.

That beauty is called into question, however, when one sees flyover shots of the suburban landscape, with rows of identical houses and identical yards, or when the movie shows us some propogandistic newsreel footage from the fifties and sixties extolling the suburbs' virtues. The inorganic appearance of these scenes makes it clear that the suburbs were the result of pervasive central planning. It should be no wonder that alienation is so common in the suburbs, or that the sense of community has been almost completely lost. The whole landscape of our metropolises have been overseen by bureaucratic planners, and the human element is entirely absent. We traded a horribly exploitive, almost prison-like factory system for an alienating, mind-numbing bureaucratic society that is still quite exploitive. Although the documentarians can't help but make this clear, they seem so attached to the 20th century American dream that they cannot comprehend that the collapse of suburbia might be a good thing in the long run. The centralized metropolis with its heavily subsidized suburban satellites has been a wasteful, alienating venture. What people need is the opportunity to develop their communities organically. This documentary gives us glimpses of these problems, but unfortunately never really puts them into a coherent framework.",1139011200,24,2827,5.154684095860566
173911,3,097369470X,"The documentary was great, with some qualifications.  To me, it presented two very strong arguments.  First, the suburban sprawl phenomenon is a transient thing.  Cheap oil and goverment cooperation with the auto industry (read, infrustructure investment choices [highways into the hinterland], post-war housing for veterans in the urban periphery, et al) created what Knustler called one of the greatest misallocation of resources in memory.  Second, we have or will reach a period of 'Peak Oil'.  The claim is that oil production follows a normal distribution curve, where time is on the x-axis and quantity on the y-axis.

Both of these arguments were very compelling to me.  Unfortunately, the documentary detoured into some non-sequitors that - I think - were a bit shrill...  Without touching on all the problems, I would say that a common thread of error is that they do not allow for changes in peoples' behavior.  To me, they do not allow that prices will communicate these new realities to the public and that people will thus change their behavior.

We waste a lot of energy: when energy becomes more expensive, we can avoid a loss in wealth by changing our behavior.  Currently, prices don't compell us to conserve.  They will if or when gas hits $5 a gallon and heating bills double (or triple).  Such a state of affairs would hurt us only in the short run.  In the long run, investment will adjust as firms seek to capitalize on what the marketplace is unable to provide in quantities that people prefer.  Certainly, there was too much apocalyptic talk in the latter half of the documentary.

There is no energy plan for this eventuallity, just like our lack of a plan in New Orleans. As the world's reserves dwindle, oil will be harder and more expensive to extract. Our energy prices will skyrocket as we compete with China and India for less and less supply. There is a stunning array of products we take for granted that are made from oil, like plastic.

173914,5,097369470X,"This documentary raises a possibility with truly staggering implications --that the lifestyle Americans and other wealthy industrial nations have come to take for granted will soon come to an abrupt halt. The basic premise of the film is based on the theory that we have reached --or possibly passed-- the stage of ""peak oil."" That is, no matter how efficient we are or how many oil-rich nations we invade, there is simply not going to be enough oil in the near future to keep up with the ever-increasing demand. This, combined with an impending shortage of natural gas, which is required for electricity, means that some drastic  and painful changes may soon be forced upon millions of people.

The End of Suburbia is definitely a film with a message. There is no attempt to present an opposing point of view here. I suppose interviewing an oil company spokesperson with a dissident opinion would not have added much value. There are, I believe, nonpartisan experts who do not agree with the peak oil theory, but interested viewers can do their own research, which is always a good idea. The film could be criticized for its mainly pessimistic slant, but this can hardly be avoided considering the topic! They do present some possible alternatives towards the end, such as the new urbanism movement, which seeks to create more livable cities in place of sprawl.

The experts interviewed in The End of Suburbia, such as Mike Ruppert and Jim Kunstler are articulate and convincing. Ruppert has a very informative web site where he gives updates on this and other important issues. The film handles its subject in an entertaining way, giving the history of American suburbia from the post-World War ll era to the present. The fact is, America has invested in and subsidized this automobile-centered way of life to the exclusion of all alternatives. The cost of this is something we may only be starting to realize. Ironically, I saw this film a week after gas in the U.S. went above $3/gallon, which would have been unthinkable a short time ago. This may be only the beginning.

The modern suburban landscape is, after all, fairly bizarre if we think about it and stop taking it for granted. Millions of people drive long distances every day, going from cardboard-cutout homes to office cubicles,  Walmarts and gargantuan shopping centers. As The End of Suburbia points out, the suburb is an entirely artificial environment, neither city nor country and combining the worst of each. It is, perhaps, a good thing in the long run that its reign is most likely about to end.",1125878400,52,2569,4.8561643835616435

However, if we are to apply the precautionary principle in managing our future, then we should assume that we will need to adjust to a world in which oil, and the products made from it, will be scarce and expensive, if they are even available.

Richmond Hill (Ontario), the town in which I live, has the dubious distinction of being featured briefly in the film: there is footage of a huge new subdivision being built in an area where a beautiful forest stood until recently. The developers had the temerity to post huge signs, shown in the film, saying, ""Live in Harmony With Nature"". They could not have delivered a bigger insult if they tried.

The line that still resonates with me from this film stated: ""some day most of suburbia will be nothing but valueless slums"". As someone who has most of his wealth tied up in a suburban home, I feel as though my circumstances are resting on a ticking time bomb... if I detect real estate prices starting to slide, I'll sell my house and move into a smaller, more energy-efficient townhouse nearer to decent public transit, say three Hail Marys and hope for the best.

A book with an equivalent message to this movie is ""The Long Emergency"", by Jim Kunstler. As JK puts it, most of civilization is sleepwalking into the future. When I see yet another subdivision around here replace forested land, and watch yet another car dealership open up to join the other 20 already in our town, and observe dangerously overweight kids being fed high-fat junk food by their parents while they sit in their SUVs, I really believe that the average North American citizen is in a perpetual consumption-gratification trance.

Also, interesting to see how Malthusian ideas such as the premise of this movie are always, always wrong based on advances in science and engineering-- wind, solar and battery technologies are primed to prevent the predictions of this movie from coming true.",1480377600,,438,5.154929577464789

7794563,1,097369470X,"It would be of great interest to have another film maker interview the experts who are the basis for this film.  The absolute certainty of their predictions about everything from the availability of natural gas to the reintroduction of the draft in the near term did not happen.  A very high percentage of their comments are just not factual today.

This film does a dis-service to real issues about climate change and the need for society to always look at reducing waste in everything we do.  It is filled with doom and gloom and totally ineffective in a communication strategy that might change behaviors.",1432598400,,608,4.8173076923076925
7794564,2,097369470X,"This was a video I had to watch for a class requirement. It was very doomsday and end of days feeling which made it impossible to believe the claims. Had the information been presented in a more objective manner it would have been better received. The lack of balance made it impossible to take seriously,",1425427200,3,305,4.5636363636363635
7794565,5,097369470X,"I watched this twice since it arrived, both times highly engaged.  It is a wake up call for everyone to begin learning how to grow your own food, building relationships with a group of people you can trade with in the near future.  I'm telling everyone I know about this movie.",1401840000,,277,4.411764705882353
7794566,4,097369470X,Great film.  Gives you a good insight on possible effects of energy crisis as it pertains to the American dream.  It explains where the American dream comes from.,1398729600,,162,4.75
7794567,5,097369470X,"Although a bit dated, especially when considering the issues surrounding the cost and quantity of natural gas, this is still an informative and profound look at the current state of resource use and population distribution in the US. The so-called party will not last forever, but how we prepare for the clean-up is of utmost importance. This is a very sobering documentary, yet one that ought to be watched by students, educators, city planners, city officials, children, parents, and grandparents.",1395273600,,499,5.25
7794568,1,097369470X,"This movie should be put in every time capsule for this time.  Even now, less ten years after the video came out, these so call expert futurists look foolish.  It should serve as a wake up call for all people that think smart growth is the answer to our future.

In this period gem, experts tell us with great certainty that Natural Gas is in decline and Oil is rapidly running dry.  An Iranian Oil ""expert"" estimated his country would run out of oil in 2007.

Ha.  The future has a way to revenge the hubris of experts.  Natural Gas is booming in North America and is at all time low prices.  It promises a cleaner solution to energy than oil with greater efficiency than solar or wind and the problems with nuclear and coal.

The naked manipulation of the viewer seems quaint.  With the juxaposition of imagery and the dark music sound track.

The end of world did not come on December, 22, 2012 as the Mayans predicted.  Today is quite a beautiful day.  The future belongs to the optimist and the innovator.  The past belongs to the failed futurists and pessimists.

Come to think of it, where are the Mayans today?

Don't fret over the doom and gloom these failed ""experts"" predict.

(James Howard Kunseler, one of the films chief expertsin 2004 wants to start a local newspaper. Opps.  He failed to recognize the economics of the Internet. Drat.  Pessimism always sells.  I guess he'll stick to that)

7794569,4,097369470X,"This documentary examines the history of suburban life and the wisdom of this distinctly American way of life in the context of the peaking of conventional oil.  It clarifies the choices we made as a society and the consequences we are facing: drastic reduction of our energy supply, reduced standard of living, increased use of the military in seeking oil, extreme rise in food prices, likely social chaos.  The film encourages us to stop our denial and begin moving in a sustainable direction now.  As for the suburbs, they are ""the slums of the future.""",1351123200,,556,4.831578947368421
7794570,2,097369470X,"The DVD makes its point very well in a Mike Moore sort of way - but, having been a student of suburbia for 40 years, I felt frustrated that some fundamental pieces of information were omitted.  It would be useful to trace back to the origins of Los Angeles' suburbia in the pre-car era, for example (triggered by the rail system), and the promotion of ""out of town"" living by the London tube system.  A study of the changes that occurred to city form and structure as the middle class grew might give some clues to how suburbs might reorganise rather than collapse as oil becomes prohibitively expensive.

The near certainty that alternatives to internal combustion engines and even automobiles will become widespread before people will en masse suffer drastic changes in lifestyle also needed to be explored more.  There will be readjustment, but perhaps not in the way the video foretells.

There might be many good reasons to hope for a different urban form and structure - but I suspect that the availability or otherwise of oil won't be the prime trigger, and (as self-contained ex-urban towns can demonstrate) a complete revamp of the way cities work may not be an essential part of any adjustment.  By neglecting such themes, this video might serve as a wake-up call but does not paint a realistic picture of the future of the places where most people in the developed world choose to live.",1345939200,2,1397,4.75206611570248
