8706891,5,B00UHJ7JXA,"A powerful and engaging look at the largest salmonella outbreak in history and the reasons that it took so long for the contaminated meat to be removed from the market. Frontline uses the story of the hunt for the cause of the outbreak to add narrative drive to a wider exploration of salmonella and antibiotic resistance in the meat system, the failures of factory farms to provide safe food, and the shortcomings of the government regulations that should've stopped this outbreak sooner. In many ways, as the title suggests, this is a companion piece to their documentary ""The Trouble with Antibiotics,"" and the webpages for both documentaries contain full sources, more information, and updates. I have not been able to figure out what the other reviewer was objecting to exactly but quite clearly he or she was able to tell what the cause was from the documentary; Frontline can't fix this, they can only expose it. A riveting watch in the best traditions of investigative journalism.",1443571200,,988,4.957831325301205
8706892,1,B00UHJ7JXA,"This segment of FRONTLINE is the 60 MINUTES version of FRONTLINE...

Apparently some 634 people over 26 states in US have got contaminated over the last decade and have died from salmonella which was linked to Foster Farms (FF) three plants in US but USDA could not recall the chickens nor USDA could demand nor USDA could force FF to change their standards or devise a plan to reduce its Salmonella levels. The only thing USDA can do is to keep sending them warning letters like USDA did in October of 2013. Finally USDA closed one of three FF's contaminated plants in Livingston for cockroach infestation but not for salmonella. Despite USDA warning to FF in their January 21, 20015 letter that ""FF has failed to prevent or eliminate Salmonella"", FFs response has been that FF has never listed Salmonella as a hazard to worry about nor to reasonably occur in their plants.

This documentary did not address why the cause is not being reversed instead they just made juicy interviews that show chaos and addressed the symptoms. The cause here is ""Why Salmonella is not considered an adulterant and what would it take for US government to make it adulterant""... The players responses for the symptoms but not the cause;
1. The attorney suing in behalf all those poultries blamed USDA, forget about him since he is after everyone's money not public interest so easy for him to blame the Secretary of Agriculture.
2. USDA head guy blamed the system since all he can do is issue warning letters. He is the lowest ranking dude so forget about him as well since he is instructed with his liabilities.
2. The Congresswoman, Rosa DeLauro blamed Secretary of Agriculture when infact she can come up with a bill or push that committee for a bill but then she will lose her job which no one in Congress would do that since majority are there for the benefits of the job not losing their job.
3. The Secretary of Agriculture blamed the Courts claiming that ""THEY WERE TOLD BY COURTS THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY OR THE JURISDICTION TO DO THAT"". Well, he needs to keep his job and he will lose job if he pushes his luck and does what Congresswomen advised her to do.

CONCLUSION: This is an informative documentary about certain facts but not the real fact. Let's do not forget, it was produced for PBS so understandably they all need to keep their jobs as well while collecting donations so it is obvious that the producers failed to mention;
1. If only two hundred thousand out of one million Americans are contaminated yearly from poultry then how other eight hundred thousand Americans are contaminated with Salmonella... That is the other 80%.
2. Now anyone with any common sense knows that Congress does not need hearings to pass a law. If wanted, they will do so immediately. Those hearings are nothing but a circus to show to naive voters those collecting our tax dollars care for certain issues when infact they really do not care since they will bring resolution just like this hearing were they did nothing at all, zilch. Secretaries of governmental agencies are hired since they are politicians as well as friend to the hierarchy so none of those agencies will do anything unless they are instructed by the hierarchy. The attorneys are there to make money so they are not there for the public. The question here is when the producers of FRONTLINE chose to make this documentary which understandably they did not name it ""The Foster Farm Scandal"" since they were not interested in being chased by deep pockets of FF either, then why did not they simply ask 1)the Secretary of Agriculture 2)USDA 3)the Congresswoman that US government was the entity who recommended to the Courts with beef industry that """"COURTS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER SALMONELLA AN ADULTERANT"""" against the wishes of AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION in 1947 case against US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (17.00) and what would it take to reverse the judgment and which entity representing the US government is failing in doing their work

Deduct four stars for  not dealing with the cause and finding what would it take to reverse the cause. The only individual who made the proper evaluation was the previous USDA employee when he said the process is not broken since it never worked. Unless citizens do not demand new regulations, nothing will change since it is financially more economical for the system to deal with few legal actions here and there rather than revising the judgment which will impact poultry producers and their cost. I hope David Fanning does not lose his job since after all if FF has been avoiding to address the cause, it only shows the power of FF and the poultry industry through our representatives in Congress so they will not take this reporting kindly at all.",1431475200,,4760,4.750906892382104
