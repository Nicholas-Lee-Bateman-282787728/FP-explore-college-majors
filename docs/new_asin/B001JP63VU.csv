His good looks and powerful physique saw him portrayed on Wheaties cereal boxes and in 1927, brought an offer for motion picture screen tests that resulted in a long and successful career in Hollywood --- He appeared in minor roles until 1930 when he was cast as the star in a western movie entitled ""Billy the Kid"" and directed by King Vidor, the film also features Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett.

Brown went on to make several top-flight movies under the name John Mack Brown, including The Secret Six (1931) with Wallace Beery, as well as the legendary Lost Generation celebration of alcohol, ""The Last Flight"" (1931), and was being groomed by MGM as a leading man until being replaced on a film in 1931, with all his scenes re shot with Clark Gable in his place --- Rechristened Johnny Mack Brown, ""Fighting Kit Carson"" (1933) he returned to making exclusively westerns and eventually became one of the screen's top B-movie cowboy stars, making 127 western films during his career, including ""Ride 'Em Cowboy"" (1942) with Abbott and Costello --- Brown also starred in four serials for Universal Studios (Rustlers of Red Dog (1935), Wild West Days (1937), Flaming Frontiers (1938) and The Oregon Trail (1939) and was a hero to millions of young children at movie theaters and on their television screens --- Altogether, Brown appeared in over 160 movies between 1927 and 1966, as well as a smattering of television shows, in a career spanning almost forty years --- In recognition of his contribution to the motion picture industry, Brown was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd --- In 1969, Brown was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Our story line and plot, Marshals Nevada (Johnny Mack Brown) and Sandy Hopkins (Raymond Hatton) are sent to investigate a series of bank robberies --- Nevada joins the outlaw gang while Sandy becomes the town cobbler --- Nevada learns that Slade (Edmund Cobb) is the boss of the gang but that there is someone on the inside tipping them off --- As they arrive at the troubled town to which they have been assigned, a bank robbery is in progress, after which event Sandy takes up the tools of a recently deceased cobbler in order to gather rumors and other intelligence of the bandits, while Nevada, with Brown's characteristic shrewdness, aggressively infiltrates the gang, as the partners' activities dovetail toward an exciting conclusion --- directed by Lambert Hillyer, whose smooth ability at all types of action fare avoids the temporally parochial badge worn by some ""B"" western helmsmen, is photographed in atmospheric fashion by undervalued Harry Neumann, while Glenn Tryon's script largely avoids the hackneyed, and capable character actors Edmund Cobb and Robert Frazer are present in key roles, with the dialogue between the two leads full of happily easy conceits --- By the time this skillfully made six reel western was released, Johnny Mack Brown, as Jack ""Nevada"" McKenzie, and Raymond Hatton, as his sidekick Sandy Hopkins, had established a pedigree as the most often filmed set of partners (eventually 45 titles) in cinematic cowpoke history and here the two, as undercover U.S. Marshals, employ their customary system of splitting up in order to better assay the capabilities of their criminal rivals.
