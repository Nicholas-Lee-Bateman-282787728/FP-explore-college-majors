7906320,1,B00000F11F,A gross disappointment. Nothing close to the caliber of inspiration provided by his books. There must've been truly extenuating circumstances present for a man of Cap stocks caliber to lend his name to this production.,1403481600,,218,5.257142857142857
7906321,5,B00000F11F,"A fine video featuring one of the greats in hunting literature.

It is more of a promotional video for African hunting. It shows the actual places and situations that one can expect. A good choice if you are considering an African hunting trip.

His book, Safari, is very practical, and was written deliberately to take into consideration the changing nature of African governments and game laws. It was written in the 1980s, and it still a valuable reference.",1392940800,,460,4.884615384615385
7906322,3,B00000F11F,Its nice to put a face/voice with the name. I enjoy Capstick books but not the videos as much. Rent it first.,1389225600,,109,4.0
7906323,5,B00000F11F,"I bought it for my brother who is 86 and has failing eyesight. He loved to read and misses it alot.

Although this does not repace reading, it is one of the substitutes I have found.

Yes, I'd recomend this DVD for those who enjoy the thrills of an African Safari.",1370390400,,264,4.1568627450980395
7906324,5,B00000F11F,"The Capstick hunting videos are absolutely top shelf.

I recommend the complete set.

Cheers!
