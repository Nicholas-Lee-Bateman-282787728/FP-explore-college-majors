5460609,5,B00ANRG4A0,Saw this award-winning hilarious film at Mockfest Film Festival in November 2012. I laughed out loud with the rest of the audience too many times to count! Director/Writer Jason Lockhart has a real gift for comedic timing. I'm happy to add this to my movie collection.,1357776000,6,268,4.8478260869565215

8554796,3,B00ANRG4A0,The movie had some great nude scenes but there wasn't really a plot to the movie,1475366400,,80,4.0625
8554797,1,B00ANRG4A0,Very bad movie. I watched I and wanted my money back.,1424217600,,53,3.909090909090909
8554798,2,B00ANRG4A0,This movie is a bit of a misrepresentation. It advertises unrated T&A and gives you PG-13 content. The women are gorgeous but mostly clothed and the men are not very funny. Cattle Call with Chelsea Handler is a better movie about this exact same unoriginal idea and Argo is a much better film about a fake movie to spend an hour and a half on. Pass on this one said Tim Tebow.,1372377600,6,376,4.236111111111111

Shot as a documentary they talk to the camera.  Swearing throughout and some toplessness we watch as each guy gets to screen test their dream gal and think they might be able to hook up with them.  The girls, meanwhile, are eager to advance their careers.

At times funny, a suprising number of actors to shoot such a little movie. Entertaining, engaging.",1372032000,2,643,5.747368421052632
8554800,4,B00ANRG4A0,It's not that terrible. I thought for a low budget movie they did all right. I wasn't a fan of the lead actor in his role but the supporting cast had some good lines and played there roles well.,1365897600,,194,4.0
8554801,1,B00ANRG4A0,"I had no interest in reviewing this movie for Amazon, but after seeing 3 suspicious looking 5 star reviews for a movie this poor, I figured I'd give my impression of the movie.

In almost every movie there is some redeeming quality, a decent performance, a few good jokes, some interesting scenery; however, the best way to describe this movie is bland. If it were food, it would be a bowl full of spaghetti without the sauce.

Understand the video quality is fine, the audio is intelligible, and the movie stars several attractive actresses who judging by their IMDB profiles work steadily if not necessarily impressively; however, nothing really happens. The end result is a boring, pedantic film. Judging by the packaging one might expect a direct to video raunchy sex comedy but the film has neither sex or comedy.

If the movie were bad in an over-the-top cheesy way then at least it would be enjoyable this however, is simply a flat unremarkable and easily forgettable movie that as stated before is simply bland.",1365638400,2,1019,4.811428571428571
8554802,1,B00ANRG4A0,"Beware of any movie which gets 3 five star reviews from various people...who actually sound like the same person.  Now I will admit...I haven't seen this movie (and I use that term ""movie"" loosely)...but I've seen enough of these UNRATED teen raunch fest turkeys to know that none of them would ever get five stars...EVER!  Even if I thought this infantile slop was mildly funny, it would still be low on the totem pole of stars.  These movies are all the same.  Some are just made slightly better than others.  Most of the time they just suck.  There should be a law (or at least a good spanking) against insiders promoting their own product with phony reviews.  Just remember...if it looks like crap...it probably is!",1359849600,5,719,4.704
8554803,5,B00ANRG4A0,I had been hearing some hype about this film so I went and saw it at Mockfest.  Thank goodness I bought my tickets early because it was sold out!  I laughed the entire way through the movie.  It has some really amazing moments.  The writing is great and the actors are cast perfectly.  I can't wait to see the next movie Jason Lockhart puts out!,1359417600,4,345,4.246153846153846
8554804,5,B00ANRG4A0,"I also saw this at a film festival.  It's one of the funniest new films I've seen in awhile!  The cast was fantastic, such a talented group of up-n-comers.  I really hope the film does well.  This writer/director, Jason Lockhart, is going places!  He's a funny actor too, they all are!  I laughed my ass off the whole movie.  It's loaded with such great ""quotable"" lines.  A cult classic in the making for a new generation of comedy!",1357862400,4,433,4.461538461538462
