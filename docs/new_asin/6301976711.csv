397948,4,6301976711,"This movie is an eye opener for any bride-to-be. First of all, it details the struggle between what the bride and groom want for their wedding. In other movies about upcoming weddings, brides mostly reigned over the entire wedding plan. This movie detailed what the groom also wanted. Donna and Michael disagreed on almost all wedding plans--even the color of the tuxes! It is a good dose of wedding-fantasyland and marital reality. Donna realizes Michael intends to maintain the tightly-knit relationships with his friends, once they are married. Doesn't he know he can't? The struggle between letting go of the life you are comfortable with and the unexplored reality of living with someone you've never lived with, even though you love him or her, creates doubt.",1022976000,10,765,5.079365079365079
397949,5,6301976711,"I first saw this movie in 1989, before anyone knew who Ron Eldard and Annabella Sciorra were. It is just as good now as it was 10 years ago, proof that quality work withstands the test of time!  Hysterical, painful,  touching. An excellent study of the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of  Italian-American families, as well as of the multitude of stresses one  feels on the journey to the altar ... If you liked ""The  Daytrippers"", you will fall head over heels for ""True Love"".  Savoca's (first and) best work in my humble opinion.",927158400,14,531,4.717391304347826

398002,5,6301976711,"Unlike all the ""live happily ever after"" romance movies that end at the expectation of marriage, or movies that end with the couple finally making it down that aisle to eternal happines, this one tells it like it is.  It contains a deep and universal truth.  And so funny and sad and true and insightful.  Savoca is a genius.",1307059200,2,325,4.47457627118644

398005,1,6301976711,"Another pointless movie that attempts to copy other classics like American Graffiti, Saturday Night Fever, and others. For the most part, it fails miserably. The plot is nearly implausible. Inexplicably, almost nothing seems to play on their vintage like radios but 50's hits. The furniture, the cars, the over idealism of the families, everything is reminiscent of a bygone era. Their favorite television shows are b/w slapstick comedies. Yet the year is 1989. Regardless, it is obvious that that the intention is to place the setting in a time decades before the late 80's. The women gather in kitchens for coffee klatches giggling at jokes that aren't funny. Sciorra's mother is a sweet, yet remarkably naive sort who seems to have stepped straight out of 1952. Her fiancee's mother is the same, albeit a dryer version.

Michael is an immature young man, ridiculously gregarious, behaving in a way that would embarass the average 12 year old. He is a handsome man, and seems to mistake pathetic and vulgar hijinks for charm. Shortly before her wedding Donna admits to Lana that she frequently feels like ""killing"" Michael, but then she ""sees him.""  She says nothing about his personality, mentions no fine atributes of character. Sciorra is 'marrying a face.' Sciorra seems to think she can, through sheer force of her personality, fashion a mature husband out of a man who will never grow up. Any man who would get the bright idea to party with ""the guys"" on his wedding night simply doesn't 'get it' and probably never will.

At times Sciorra is her own worst enemy. It is the middle of the night, hours before the wedding and she sneaks her fiancee in and they make love. By morning time, they are completely exhausted from staying up all night for days on end, non-stop partying, vicious fighting. On the ride to the church Sciorra looks anything but what a woman about to be married should look like. Though beautiful, she has a pallor that can only be attributed to fatigue and emotional stress. She looks resigned to her fate, profoundly sad, really. Her father, a kindly sort, offers her an escape. He gently reminds her that it is not too late to back out of near certain disaster. It is clear that is he is pained to hand over his beloved daughter to this overgrown jester. But Sciorra is doggedly determined; she is going to marry 'the face.'

The wedding party is a disaster when Michael gets the idea that he and his buddies should go out after the reception is over. A vicious argument follows. The end is simply anticlimactic. The couple begin an uncertain yet most predictably disastrous life, and will probably raise equally troubled children.",1241222400,3,2663,4.807860262008734
398006,3,6301976711,"The Bottom Line:

An interesting drama about two people who are going to get married just because it seems like they should, not because they love each other, True Love is a bit uneven and often dated but it's a reasonably successful movie if you don't ask for much.",1240185600,3,266,4.428571428571429
398007,2,6301976711,"I am a transplant from New York to Connecticut. My husband and I wondered what Bronx this movie was about. One time there was a large Italian population around Pelham Parkway, but that was back in the 1960's. Over the years most Italians moved to Queens, Long Island or New Jersey. We couldn't figure out what time period this was supposed to represent. The Bronx changed colors from Italian and Irish to black.
So for me this movie did not ring true. I did not see one black person in it. Not in the bars, or on the streets. I also could not understand why the bride didn't see her groom-to-be was a boy-man. He certainly showed that in his many promises to her to come back in an hour or so and then go out and get drunk with his friends.
The acting was good. The music was terrific. However, because I felt the movie portrayed a Bronx that no longer exists, I wouldn't recommend it.",1079136000,4,885,4.3053892215568865
398008,5,6301976711,"I thought this movie was classic. I first saw in on Cinemax. Never see it in video stores or libraries.
A great movie to show to your friends when they are about to get married, to scare the ... out of them. The thing that really hits home in this film is how 2 people in love begin to discover things about each other which seem like roadblocks, that they either weren't expecting or thought they would have no problem managing. And isn't it how many relationships start out - bliss and no problems. It's only when it comes to that settling down concept, that i believe as ""Mike"" says in the film, ""Everything becomes very very complicated"".
There were several strong performances in this movie, and some of the bit players nearly stole the show, like the dude working in the deli who played your classic nightmare employee.
I had a chance to meet Aida Tuturro during filming of The Wright Verdicts and told her how much I liked this film. I had also met Ron Shapiro at a closed door audition, who is the brother of Rick Shapiro(who plays ""Kevin""). Ron and Rick are practically identical, except Ron has some height. I'm surprised that the two haven't managed to do work that has gotten any attention.
Overall, I think this film is a must see for people of all ages. I think it's one of the most naturally funny movies without trying too hard that I've ever seen. And at the same time, it can be scary for people contemplating marriage.
Thumbs, and fingers, up - to make this film a ""10"".",1061596800,12,1489,4.437956204379562

Look for Ron Eldard dancing the Hucklebuck in a bar. They referred to the Honeymooners when WPIX-11 showed them every night at 11:30
for decades. Great Atlantic City scene, (Ron's bachelor party) sitting on the Boardwalk eating White Castle hamburgers. My only regret is that
the DVD is in Full Frame (1.33) hopefully a widescreen or better yet a blu-ray will be released.",1430524800,2,514,4.8522727272727275
