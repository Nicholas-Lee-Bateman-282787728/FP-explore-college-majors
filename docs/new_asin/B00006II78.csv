7969196,4,B00006II78,Only problem with this workout was that the volume kept going up and then down... at some points it was super loud than a few seconds later it was so low. that was the only bad thing about this tape.  the songs are fun and the workout is a solid 25 minutes.  definitely a keeper :),1230422400,,281,4.0
7969197,2,B00006II78,I guess I made a mistake when I bought this but I've looked everywhere on the descriptions to see if it said it was a VHS set and it didn't.  I don't have a VCR so this was a problem.  Oh well...Life goes on.,1220659200,2,208,3.7045454545454546
7969198,4,B00006II78,"Having bought Tamilee's stretch DVD's, I assumed that 'fit to the hits' would be the same superb quality instruction. Well, true - the instruction is good. But the camera work is awful.

Cameramen try and show of their skill in camera work, but this is out of place in an instructional DVD. They try and 'cut away' at crucial spots when you're trying to focus on a particular move. And they seem to believe that by switching camera positions, or zooming in on the models breasts (when you need to see the footwork) impresses the viewer. It does not! It is in fact extremely irritating.

I Love Tamilee - she is a very good instructor. Hate the cameraman!",1218758400,,654,4.533898305084746

7969200,2,B00006II78,"The problem with this video is primarily audio. The workout is fine, and could be fun, but Tamilee's voice track is so loud, and the music so quiet, that it was almost pointless for the producers to have used such potentially good tracks. A tape for rock 'n' roll lovers this is definitely not!",1046822400,2,294,4.462962962962963
7969201,3,B00006II78,"Like many others, I am a Tamilee Webb addict and have many of her video's which I love, but this set just doesn't cut the mustard.  She assumes you know the steps and doesn't take time to really walk you through them.  I am in shape and did not get anything out of it, course I could barely follow so... and, yes, you can barely hear the music that she occasionally sings too.  I suppose once you've done the tape a dozen times you might get the moves but good luck.  For dancing to the grooves I find the MTV Grind much better.",1046304000,,528,4.097087378640777
7969202,2,B00006II78,"I was very dissappointed with these videos!! I really like Tamilee Webb's other videos like the ""I want those"" series and her stretching videos are awesome! But not in this case. The music was so soft that you couldn't really hear it. Hard to keep moving to a beat you can not hear. She keeps sing with the songs, which isn't that big a deal because I would have sung along too if I could have heard the music. But, all I could hear was hear sing. I wasn't playing this on a small TV system either. Big screen with surround sound. She moves from one step to the next quickly. I found it hard to keep up with which step I was suppose to do. I just wasn't inspired or motivated to finish the tape or do it again.",1037923200,7,710,4.078571428571428
