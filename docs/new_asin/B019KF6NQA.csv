7576439,5,B019KF6NQA,"Updated to the present?  Yes.  Challenging?  Yes.  Euro-trash?  Definitely not.  The soprano earned even more feverish applause than the magnificent Jonas Kaufman himself. Okay, I winced at Preziosella as a dominatrix -- but even that served the production's vision of passions played out in a corrupt -- even bawdy -- cultural milieu.  The monk's bitter and sarcastic ravings as he hands out food to the needy probably has some sociological truth.  I normally hate updatings -- Mozart in a Burger King in Newark, etc. -- but this updating works and unfailingly serves the drama.",1464393600,7,579,5.085106382978723
7576440,3,B019KF6NQA,"What a shame! Such really great singing; such heavenly music; such a dreadful production! For a while I thought it made some sense, but as the singing got better and better the direction (and sets) fell apart with Kusej's self-serving attempt to be modern and shocking. I couldn't help wishing the singers had simply refused to go through with the absurdities they were asked to perform. Indeed, I would like to think that a singer with the prestige of a Kaufmann could have put a stop to the nonsense by backing out when he saw what was going on. I have seen many updated productions in which the intelligence behind them enlightens me and with such a cast, I thought this might be one. But it wasn't. Five stars for the opera and the singing. None for the production. So it's a three.",1464393600,19,786,4.503496503496503

7576442,3,B019KF6NQA,"The singing is this performance is good.  Kaufmann, Harteros and Tezier do a fine job and are the reason to buy this DVD.  The production is another ""Regie"" affair.  It can be best described as silly non-sense.  Darken your screen and listen to the fine singing.",1463875200,14,262,4.630434782608695
7576443,1,B019KF6NQA,"The director has changed the time and place of the opera to modern dayhe has changed Alvaro from loving charmer to a bad upstart guzzeling wine instead of giving Leonora the confidence she needs to elope.  Instead of an overature you are tranfixed in a dining room instead of leonaora's bedroom, a wine guzzelong priest, lepnora jumping up and down runing in and out looking for Alvaro and a fther that thinks his daugter is nuts just by his glancing at her running about  In act 2 you find Leonpra still in the same clther hiding under a table and her brother has been transformed from a 10 year old in act one to a 20 something  in act 2. Preziosila does not look anything like the gypsy girl seeking recruits for the army. Could not take it any more and stopped watching. Where is the Metropolitan Opera when you need it.you need it/  Buy the Cd chuck the DVD/",1463788800,19,863,4.375
8745482,1,B019KF6NQA,"The delicate drama of Verdi with many beautiful pieces of music was totally destroyed by poor modernized staging, and Wagnerian style performance of the orchestra and choir that  had changed the spirit of the opera . Verdi would have walked out of the opera house !! Watch the 2006 production with soprano Susanna Branchini or 1984 Metropolitan production with Leontyne Price  to get to the real spirit of this opera of Verdi",1522195200,,425,4.888888888888889

8745486,1,B019KF6NQA,"The only reason to give this shamble a one star is Kaufmann.  I cannot believe what European houses are doing to opera, especially Bayreuth. Why take a classic like Forza and prostitute it in such a production?  It made absolutely no sense.  I found it offensive to everything Verdi intended as far as message delivery.  This was a sad defamy of a beautiful opera.  If you have to save on production costs, skimp on the sets and costumes but STOP this modernization nonsense.  Perhaps I am old school but I think opera lovers want productions that keep the classics...CLASSIC, not bastardized interpretations of some bafoon looking to make a name for himself by ""innovation""!  The principals were the only reason I persevered to the bitter end.",1498003200,8,744,4.857142857142857
