8107526,5,B000E991DE,"I enjoyed all four of these movies.  Some might say a bit dated, but formyself I love old movies, whether they are considered top shelf or B Grade, I love them all.",1415059200,,164,4.125
8107527,4,B000E991DE,"THE PHANTOM: Absolutely creaky 1931 thriller of an escaped from Death Row master criminal after the DA that sent him there.  The action takes place in a couple of old dark houses.  The characters are played by a bunch of zero talent non-actors.  Though the sets are not bad the whole thing plays like a BADLY produced play.  There is no background music to move things along.  It only takes about 61 minutes to do its thing.  Watching a silent movie would be more exciting.  The quality of the picture is OK, probably the best there will ever be.

I will review the other films on this DVD as I watch them.",1410652800,,606,4.348214285714286
8107528,3,B000E991DE,"The Phantom is a real joke. As for the Intruder and best of all Tangled Destinies are the best. All I can say about Dead Men Walk
is the sound is some what better than the single release which you can find on Amazon.com. All in all worth having if for no other reason the ""Tangled Destines"".",1383523200,3,291,4.12280701754386

8107530,2,B000E991DE,"Fans of the old time tinglers needn't bother with this one.  The two stars are for the dual role played by George Zucco in Dead Men Walk.  The other three movies should never have been made.  The talent of Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams was totally wasted in ""The Phantom"".  The ghoulish character that everyone is led to believe is the phantom is merely one of his nutty henchmen who seems to terrify his prey (mainly an overly exciteable maid) by entering a room shielding his face with a cape and when within striking distance merely wiggles his fingers and leers at his intended victim. The phantom is actually a doctor in an insane asylum that has a hidden passage to his underground laboratory. It seems every creaky old house or castle in the movies from this era had secret passageways. I guess the phantom doctor's scheme is brain transfers from sane people to insane people.  This movie is not scary or funny!  Another hour you're not going to get back is the equally lame ""Intruder""  about a murder & missing jewels on the ocean liner S.S. Intruder.  All the main characters wind-up shipwrecked on a remote island that features a man in a monkey suit and his insane friend who hasn't seen a barber in at least 10 yrs.  Winds up the detective is the murderer and thief. So boring who cares. Survivors are rescued by a french ocean liner. The comic relief drunk ends the movie shooting a revolver in the air and no one including the crew seems to care. Tangled destinies is about a group of people flying to LA who make a forced  landing during a storm. They take refuge in a vacant farm house. Even though the house is abandoned there is soup on the stove waiting for our cast to arrive. The actual owner of the home never shows up during the movie. This is yet another tiresome plot concerning stolen jewels.  After a number of accusers try to discover the thief, it winds up the preacher being the culprit.  Again who cares?  Dead Man Walk was the only film of any redeeming value due to George ""Spooky"" Zucco's dual performance of the good & evil brother combination.  The evil brother is a vampire who we're told can only be killed by fire (a new one on me).  I thought sun light or a good old fashioned stake in the heart would work.  Anyway the good/bad brother combination eventually has a showdown that ends in a fiery conflagration. At least this film had an eerie, noirish atmosphere to it.  Dead Men Walk can be obtained separately from the trio of losers mentioned above. BEWARE of this DVD!  Don't waste your time or your money on this collection.  You have been warned!",1326844800,,2587,4.501070663811563
8107531,4,B000E991DE,"The quality of these films is not great, but perfectly acceptable with no splices.  Dead Men Walk would be better viewed on the Roan disc.  I also enjoyed the other three films.  These three films have conflicting running times making it difficult to determine if they are complete.  Therefore, they are most likely missing some amount of footage.",1267228800,,347,4.931034482758621
8107532,3,B000E991DE,"Retromedia has made an interesting compilation of early horror films that are genereally forgotten today,only familiar to readers of George Turner and Michael Price's ""Forgotten Horrors"" book series.

The choices are adequate,but uneven...especially in quality.
The films themselves are decent,but the prints are not remastered in the least and are rather muddy and murky and/or too pale.
This makes the 20.00 price tag particularly hard to swallow,especially since the titles are now available elsewhere at much cheaper prices(ex. The Phantom(1931) is now part of one of those MillCreek box sets,same quality,with 49(!) other movies for the same price!

I had purchased this at a Borders when it first came out,and enjoyed it enough to reccomend it to the Classic film buff and curious horror fan.
Here's the films:

The Phantom(1931)-Old dark house thriller with a maniac loose in a house and his accomplice called ""The Thing"".
Somewhat slow moving,but laced with humor and atmosphere,this ends up being one of the more peculiar of the Old Dark House thrilers of the decade.
Pretty Good.

The Intruder(1931)-BIZARRE early 30s film about people that get in a shipwreck end up on an island and have to fight for survival,what with a criminal(Harry Cording) and a totally over the top Mischa Auer,who hangs out with a Gorilla and keeps skeletons in his cave/home,which he likes to stab frequently.
He even brings one with him to rest on the sundeck of the rescue ship that rescues the survivors at the end!
Totally insane and alot of fun,this is a reason to purchase the set.

Tangled Destinies(1932)-Not very horrorific,but very entertaining film about a group of people who get lost in a  storm and have to land an airplane on the outskirts of Los Angeles,where they take refuge in an old(completely furnished!) farmhouse.
Low budget shows through,with only a few sets,but the film has good acting and characters and enough twists to sustain interest for it's brief hour long length.
Alot of fun and another gem on this set.

Dead Men Walk(1943)-Totally out of place on this set,this film is made a whole decade later than any of the others,and is not even in the same theme!
Where the others were of the ""old dark house"" school,this one is a vampire film with recognizeable horror figures!
Hardly forgotten,this widely available title has George Zucco in dual roles as kindly scientist and evil Vampire brother,as well as a hunchbacked assistant played by(who else?)Dwight Frye.
One of the better prints of this Poverty Row favorite,but it would have been more fitting to include something like The Ghost Walks(1932) or One Frightened Night(1935) instead.

Decent set,but not really worth it's high price,better to get at under ten dollars,and all films are for the true student of cinema and/or fans of Mystery like myself.",1231286400,7,2826,5.075431034482759
8107533,3,B000E991DE,"Here's a mildly entertaining collection of four poverty-row films from the 1930's.  ""Dead Men Walk"" was the only film I'd heard of before watching this disc.  And it's easily the best of the bunch.  George Zucco has a dual role as twin brothers, one of whom is resurrected as a vampire.  It also marks the final film appearance of genre favorite Dwight Frye.  ""The Intruder"" is a ghost story set aboard a ship.  There's some nice atmosphere and some dated comic relief, but it's not a bad little picture.  ""Tangled Destinies"" is a melodrama in which survivors of a plane crash are caught up in ghostly goings-on.  ""The Phantom"" is a typical 30's crime thriller, with a death row inmate targeting a crime-fighting duo.

As for the quality of the disc, it varies from film to film.  Retromedia is quite adept at finding odd, cult (and yes, forgotten) films.  But unlike competitors such as Roan or Image, they don't appear to spend too much effort on restoration.  The night scenes in Tangled Destinies are pretty murky, while The Intruder suffers from a ""washed out"" look in the daytime scenes.  Again, Dead Men Walk is the real winner here.  There are plenty of scratches, but at least the contrast is. . .well, not exactly right, but much better than the other films.  In any event, it's probably the best that any of these films will ever look on DVD.

At around an hour each, none of these ""forgotten"" films will try your patience much.  They're certainly slow-moving by today's standards.  But if like your old movies with atmosphere and don't mind the obvious low budgets, you could do a lot worse.",1167177600,14,1603,4.664285714285715
