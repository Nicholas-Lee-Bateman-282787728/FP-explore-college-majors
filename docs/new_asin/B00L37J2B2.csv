6463904,3,B00L37J2B2,"I liked series 1and 2 better. Series 3 has reverted to a typical mystery plot, with predictable outcome. A sub-story, of budding romance between over-the-top giddy shop-owner and farmer is soporific.
There is less of the early racist reactions against the Indian doctor and his wife, which were realistic and interesting. It's hard to believe everyone has accepted them in Wales.
A subplot of the mine foreman and his black lung disease is more interesting; but it stretches belief that the Indian doctor, a smart man, doesn't guess how his putting his patient on leave will affect his and his son's financial situation, i.e. they will be left poverty-stricken and the boy (Mrs. Sharma's protege) will have to leave school to get a job.

This is what happens when many writers get their hsnds ona good concept.",1407801600,8,810,4.912408759124087
6463905,5,B00L37J2B2,"The third series of this delightful programme lives up to the high standard set by series 1 & 2. Basically two prodigal brothers return to the village and make an immediate impact, especially by arriving in an immaculate Ford Mustang soft top that looks simply stunning. They've returned for a reason and, predictably, are up to no good. But no spoilers here, simply confirmation that the usual mix of serious and comedic elements are in place along with the excellent acting and production values. The storyline is a little 'lighter' than series two, but none the worse for it. Highly recommended.",1407196800,2,598,4.930693069306931
6463906,5,B00L37J2B2,This was an enjoyable series. The complications of this world getting smaller and different groups of people learning to get along with each other. Surprised that it has come to an end good acting and plots. Thank you,1512432000,,217,4.7368421052631575

6463916,5,B00L37J2B2,"This is the sweetest little series about an Indian doctor and his wife coming to Wales in the early 60's, right after the introduction of the National Health in the UK pointed out the scarcity of doctors.  Everyone in it is spot on, and we rarely get to see anything set in Wales.  Great show.",1454198400,2,293,4.3090909090909095

6463929,5,B00L37J2B2,"Love this show. So rare to find a TV show devoid of unnecessary foul language, violence, nudity, etc. these days. One that just has a fun story about a group of off-beat, entertaining, slightly eccentric characters. The Indian Doctor is similar to Doc Martin, minus the completely cranky doctor. But it is still a fun show.",1443139200,,323,4.785714285714286

6463940,3,B00L37J2B2,This series has a story line that is rather silly.  It was much more interesting when the story focused on the conflicts between Indian Culture and Welsh culture as well as the relationship between the Dr. and his wife.  This series is mediocre compared to 1 and 2...,1435363200,4,267,4.541666666666667
