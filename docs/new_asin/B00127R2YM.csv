8244495,5,B00127R2YM,I loved this series exept the very last episode. It was just a bit too weird. It threw off the whole series for me. So if you watch this series judt don't watch the last episode!,1269561600,,178,3.9722222222222223

The Manga has 13 volumes, I have the 1st 12 with 13 pre-ordered.  I've seen all 6 of the DVD and had great fun watching them.  I highly recommend Moon Phase, you too will become an addict!",1228348800,6,305,4.410714285714286
8244498,4,B00127R2YM,"I wasn't sure that I would like this series at first, but it's a really good fun series.  There is lots to laugh at and keep you entertained.  The only thing that I didn't like so much was that the last episode of the set made absolutely no sense! But it was still funny :)",1221868800,9,273,3.9454545454545453
8244499,5,B00127R2YM,"Moon Phase is a vampire anime.  Slightly light hearted, with some drama, romance, action and mystery.  Not really scary nor is it thrilling.  But still a solid good story with great, if sometimes even artistic, settings.  What really got me, besides the plot that seems well thought out, was the amount of star power in the English cast.  Luci Christian, Carrie Savage, and Caitlin Glass are in it.  But the two major stars of the piece is Monica Rial, who plays the main female character, and Colleen Chinkenbeard, who not only was part of the voice cast, but also helped write some of the episodes, was one of the ADR directors, and the line producer.  This really is a labor of love and should become a part of any anime library.  There are some extras but the 26 episodes are the meat and potatoes of the set.",1213747200,24,813,4.482993197278912
8244500,5,B00127R2YM,"this is a nice girl anime,lots of comedy and some serious moments too. the first few episodes were a little hard to get into but stay with it and it gets better. i started to like the characters(squabbling just like a regular family).it might not be to interesting to boys even tho it has some fighting but for girls and women,it's real cute.",1205625600,13,342,4.444444444444445
