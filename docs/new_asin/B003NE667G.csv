8400872,5,B003NE667G,"Triple threat Anna Nicholas wrote, directed, produced (oh wait, she acted in it as well - that's quadruple threat) this documentary-feel narrative film about the turbulent day the Rodney King verdicts came down.  Set in the microcosm of a strip mall Ms. Nicholas includes practically every LA demographic and the result is a tempest in a tea pot - that in hindsight we know was mirrored all over the city.  Tension and despair grow in the tight 97 minutes and is especially provoking somehow viewing it from 2016 as I did.  The film forces us to ask, ""What's changed, really?"" since April 29, 1992.  Somethings for sure but many not so much.  Recommended viewing!",1469145600,,663,4.780701754385965
