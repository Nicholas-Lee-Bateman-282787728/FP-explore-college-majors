8257861,5,B00158FK4W,"This is a highly addictive show, and I've seen every episode.  So sad to see the series end, and even sadder that the DVDs are only in PAL.  When are you going to release all 9 seasons in NTSC??",1471824000,,194,3.948717948717949
8257862,1,B00158FK4W,"I don't recall the product description saying this was PAL, and not NTSC, or I wouldn't have ordered it. I should not have to pay for return postage. A complete waste of my money.",1465257600,3,179,4.294117647058823
8257863,1,B00158FK4W,Both items don't work at all. So I'm disappointed,1446681600,,49,4.555555555555555
8257864,1,B00158FK4W,Cmone man !!!!!!! Can we get a region 1 dvd set or even better yet a blu ray set? Ive even contacted Channel 4 in the UK who made the movie and told them we must have made for the USA. They told me they don't sell any or plan to release any. Bollocks to that I say! With the newest and (probably) last season of peep show airing now is the time for a set to be produced.,1439510400,5,370,3.6962025316455698
8257865,5,B00158FK4W,I love this show.,1428710400,,17,3.5
8257866,5,B00158FK4W,I adore this show! If only it were available for Region 1 DVDs. And now it's no longer even on Netflix as far as I know. It is simply criminal that only season 1 of this show has been released for Region 1!,1417392000,6,206,3.813953488372093
8257867,5,B00158FK4W,"This might be the funniest show of the first decade of the 2000's. Dark, disturbed and brutally honest about human nature.",1412812800,5,122,4.857142857142857
8257868,5,B00158FK4W,"The person who wrote the first review for this is obviously does not know intelligent comedy or originally television. If I were to make a recommendation, it would be to watch That Mitchell and Webb Look before watching this, but even if you don't, this show is excellent.",1399075200,6,272,4.6875
8257869,1,B00158FK4W,"This English series was listed  by Entertainment Weekly as Criminally Neglected and that was good enough for me as a recommendation, so unfortunately I ordered all 5 seasons. I am sort of an Anglophile when it comes to British series and feel they are better than what our US TV offers. This is certainly true on most crime series, and the comedy are in the same category, Father Ted, One Foot in the Grave, Black Books, My Hero all prime examples,,,,,,then we are tossed this piece of crap. I barely made it thru the first series and not a laugh in it,,,and talk about F bombs! Who thinks that the F word is hilarious is beyond me. It seems like  this may appeal to the teeny boppers etc but I doubt that. If I can persuade one would be purchaser from this I will have done my duty.",1398038400,,783,4.283783783783784
