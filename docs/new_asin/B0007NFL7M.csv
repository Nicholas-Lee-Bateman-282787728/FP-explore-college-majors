8049225,5,B0007NFL7M,"...about Steve Morse that hasn't been said! Great videos from a fine musician. Steve's demeanor throughout the videos is just amazing, making this a lot of fun to watch. The instruction is excellent, with a lot of close-up demonstrations of techniques and notes. Really a great learning video or just plain fun to watch!",1389139200,,320,4.944444444444445
8049226,5,B0007NFL7M,"To the reviewer who said ""not much of a guitar instructional video"" You must have forgotten to actually watch it.
To say that REH's POWERLINES was more of an instruction video is absurd.
First, all 3 of the videos were recorded within a year of each other so why would Steve do another ""Powerlines"". Just because he went over his equipment doesn't mean that's all he did and the performances were not only great but the examples were transcribed from those performances and he did a much better job of making it an instructional book than on Powerlines.
I liked Powerlines too but it was a lot shorter and covered a lot less than either one of these videos.
The important thing is that all 3 videos are worth purchasing and it's really stupid to complain that they are different. That is a big plus.
What I especially liked was his decision to demonstrate how he goes about troubleshooting techniques and writing things specifically to target a technique as well as explaining his methodology for writing and practicing. What more can you ask for from a guitarist who is know for his virtuosity, versatility, creativity than to explain what he does to achieve those qualities.
The only thing I could see as a red flag for someone is that it was recorded as it coincided with the release of his ""Southern Steel"" album so there was more performance and excerpted examples derived from that album but the classics by the Dregs like Ice Cakes, Gina Lola Breakdown, Twiggs Approved, Night Meets Light etc were still included as well.",1345161600,,1528,4.705223880597015
8049227,3,B0007NFL7M,"I bought this combo pack several years ago and was disappointed. I was expecting a full on guitar instructional video like the former REH ""Power Lines"", but this ""Definitive"" video is more performances and information about his equipment/sound set-up than guitar instruction.",1276992000,,275,5.571428571428571
8049228,5,B0007NFL7M,"Simply put, Steve Morse is the best overall guitarist that I have ever heard.  He masters all styles as if they were his only one.  His ability to convey concepts and ideas for the guitar is incredible.

This is one of my best instructional investments to date.  I highly recommend it to anyone serious about improving their chops.",1227571200,,331,4.655172413793103
8049229,5,B0007NFL7M,He is an incredible player and a great teacher.  A great addition to your lessons library.,1139616000,,90,4.625
8049230,4,B0007NFL7M,"This DVD is a combination of two previously released Steve Morse instructional Video Tapes. It's a faithful copy of the tapes and nothing more. If your a Steve Morse fan (and you SHOULD be) this is a great purchase. (if you are updating your old vcr tapes, this works also) Steve covers his rig and various techniques along with samples of some of his songs. Of course the highlights are the performances of some of the songs. compaired to the original price of the video cassettes, the price is a bargain. The DVD covers about two hours worth of material. Now if they would just release Steve Morse's ""Power Lines"" on DVD.",1116460800,,623,4.571428571428571
