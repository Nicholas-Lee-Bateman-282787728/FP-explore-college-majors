7885784,5,630523518X,"This was one of the first movies I saw when I was becoming acquainted with the Hong Kong action genre. This is an incredible, visually-stunning exercise in action. Now, it is not action on the same level as John Woo or Tsui Hark. But this is a great drama and action movie all at the same time. It has graphic violence, language and mild sexuality (as in don't see it for that reason or you'll be disappointed). If you like cop dramas and action films and don't mind reading a movie (though I do enjoy when the dubbing is different than the subtitles), Beast Cops is a great movie.",1019088000,2,581,4.339449541284404
7885785,3,630523518X,"I was expecting this to be an actioned packed, drama typical to what I had come to know from Hong Kong directors. Boy I was wrong. This was a good movie, however featured only one and a half action scenes. The story was different and new, not the same old cop/triad story. Diffently watch this film but don't expect it to be up to par with John Woo in action or the characters to be as awesome as Chow Yun Fat and cast.",975974400,3,419,4.0602409638554215
7885786,5,630523518X,"this is definately one of the best hk films you will ever see. the reason for this is that the script is way better than most hk films. GORDON CHAN did it with first option and know he has done it again. it probaly helped that he had a good group of actors. ANTHONY WONG, MICHEAL WONG, ROY CHEUNG,and SAM LEE all give excellent performances. the story deals with a group of mismatched cops who try to stop a gang of young, out of control triads. the story doesnt sound that new,but, the characterations are where this movie really shines. any fan of hk movies needs to see this film.",969926400,2,583,4.3090909090909095
7885787,4,630523518X,"This film is not your usual good guys vs. bad guys.  Because there is sometimes no difference.  Anthony Wong is an outstanding actor.  His  portrayal of the crooked cop is superb.  You feel sorry for him, and hate  him at once.  Kind of like Chow Yun Fat's role in the Corruptor.  It was  fascinating to see the characters evolve as thier circumstances changed.  I  would reccomend this film.  Don't expect it to cheer you up however.",964915200,3,434,4.565789473684211
7885788,4,630523518X,"If you're familiar at all with Hong Kong cinema, you'll recognize Gordon Chan as the director of Fist of Legend, with Jet Li, among other things.  Here he's doing his thing with the police drama genre, and a fine thing it  is.  With an excellent cast including multiple Golden Horse Award (Hong  Kong version of the Oscars)winner Anthony Wong, the handsome Michael Wong  (no relation) and one of the best Hong Kong character actors, Roy Cheung,  it's top notch all the way, and Chan adds a tremendous sense of style  combining grainy street scenes with intense gray and white flashbacks.  The  story, though not terribly original, is still quite compelling, and though  not an action movie per se, it's action scenes are quite brutal and  intense.  Anthony Wong steals the show with a terrifically sincere  performance, and Michael Wong just drips male toughness as the new Lt.  assigned to Anthony Wong's unit.  The story itself concerns Anthony Wong as  a cop who walks the line between crooked and straight and his friendship  with a local Triad played well by Cheung, though whose screen time isn't as  long as I would have liked.  Cheung is involved with a murder and Wong  covers him as he flees Hong Kong until police heat dies down.  In Cheung's  absence, however, Michael Wong falls in love with, and impregnates,  Cheung's moll.  When Cheung comes back, there's hell to pay as he  discover's Michael Wongs actions as well as those of his underling Push  Pin, who has risen in the Triad ranks during his absence.  A tautly  directed fierce final battle between Anthony Wong and Push Pin's flunkies  only adds an exclamation point to an already excellent movie, and fans of  Hong Kong Police dramas will not be disappointed.  I have the DVD version,  ordered from a different site a few months ago at almost twice the price  (should've just waited for Amazon.com to get it), which includes cast bios  and multiple language selections.  The picture is beautiful, and the  lighting fits every scene to a ""tee.""  Well worth the money, I  strongly recommend this one.",951955200,,2071,4.811428571428571
7885789,5,630523518X,One of Anothny Wong's finest performances.  This is an extremely morally complex film.  The characters are wonderfully developed.  Excellent cinematography!  One of the finest cop movies out of Hong Kong (or  anywhere) in recent history!,926726400,,237,5.6571428571428575
