2200798,5,B000767QTA,"does anyone here have the resources to compare this to the other dvd releases of evangelion in terms of content and quality, or do you all just want to shoot off philosophical and psychological theories in an obviously inadequate forum for them?  your banter has done nothing to help me decide whether this version is the one i want to invest my money in.  i've seen the series, i know the issues at stake, and i know that there are plenty of message boards to debate them on.  tell me some useful product information!  i give it 5 stars because even the poor copy of evangelion i downloaded was well worth that rating.",1134518400,,619,4.451327433628318
2200799,5,B000767QTA,"...However, only partially understading it is good enough for most to enjoy it.  As a guide post - The more you prefer the original ending as compared to ""The End of Evengelion"" ending, the more you understood it.

Here's a hint, though:

The body does not live.  The soul lives.  The body is simply animated by the soul.  You have never seen anyone in your life (with your physical eyes).  You have only seen their body, or rather, an electrical image of their body.  Our bodies are not that different from Eva's at all.  The human body is basically a high end animalistic machine designed by Nature for the expression of the Spirit by way of the Soul.

Peace",1134432000,,660,4.470588235294118
2200800,5,B000767QTA,"There's some very interesting opinions on the series as you can tell from this page, but philosophy aside, this is a very entertaining series.  You don't have to be a university genius in social science to enjoy it and the characters are great.  Yes it's made in Japan and its a different culture, but i watch series that are made in the US and France and im from England, a suprisingly different culture from the US.

What i feel is the most controversial underlooked element of this series is that they are using teenage children to fight a war.  Something that unfortunately goes on in some parts of the world today.

Though this series is labeled in the 'sci-fi' genre, it's not for you if you're after non stop robot action, as the best parts of the series are the human drama elements.  I'd get something more like Gundam if you want more robot action.

Contreversial subjects such as religion and culture aside, Neon Genesis is a very entertaining anime which is well recommended, no matter what religion, culture, etc.  You will no doubt develop your own opinions on the series.",1134345600,2,1086,4.649214659685864
2200801,5,B000767QTA,"I have to disagree with S. L. Burdick ""Zombie Golf Caddy"" and his view of the series. As a series itself, you might have noticed that a lot of it is highly metaphorical. The subjectivism implied here (there's a lot of different things going on from psychology, to philosophy, to judeo-christian imagery but focusing just on subjectivism) should not be confused with the stance that ""all is illusion"" or that ""there is no such thing as reality."" Metaphysical subjectivists hold that reality is real enough, and that physical objects do exist. They conceive, however, that the nature of reality as related to a given consciousness unit is created and governed by that consciousness. Given the usual method of the series this is presented highly metaphorically and not at all in black and white.

If you haven't seen this yet, highly recommended viewing. Transcends anime and a lot of television in general to convey a deep and complex message. 5 stars.",1134345600,3,950,4.9375
2200802,1,B000767QTA,"In light of new evidence, I take back everything I ever said about this Series.

Apparently, the end result is just because the Producers, Writers, and Director had no actual communication with each other, leading to a disjointed mess.

I am no longer able to accept the flaws in the Plot Narrative as ""artistic"" license, instead of just being shodding craftsmanship and disfocused writing.",1134172800,5,390,5.078125
2200803,5,B000767QTA,"I recieved my copy today and was a bit disappointed at the lack of bonus features and inserts.. but at this price, I really cant complain.

The foil coated box is very sturdy and well made. Inside are 6 cases each containing a DVD that holds from 4 - 5 episodes.  There are basically 30 episodes total (26 from the original series + 4 more director's cut).  Upon watching, you will also notice the visual/sound enhancement that has been done in comparison to the $130+ set currently on amazon.",1133740800,8,493,4.51685393258427
2200804,3,B000767QTA,"This was an interesting concept for me.  It's basically playing on a lot of obscure hardcore philosophies.  Namely that the human soul is a fragmented piece of a greater whole, and that all paths eventually are to reuniting those souls as a single entity.  The theme here is what if humanity doesn't WANT to reassimilate?  What if we strive to maintain our independent self?  Now, I knew this from university Philosophy classes, but NOWHERE was it explained in Evangelion.  This's an early Christian viewpoint actually, but it fails to provide a method of renewal of souls.  If all paths lead to the perfect whole, where do new humans and thus souls come from?  This's a flaw in the philosophy, it's not Evangelion's fault.

Actually, there was a lot of stuff like this, such as subjective reality.  The old Greek cave is a good analogy.  If you are born in a cave facing the back wall and never turn around, soon the shadows on the back wall become your reality.  You're oblivious to the world in the other direction.  What they got TOTALLY WRONG here was the fact that just because your reality differs, the physical surroundings do NOT.  The universe will not cease to exist because you choose not to believe in it.  They make this false assumption in the last half of the series, and it's all downhill from there.  Again, hardcore philosophy that was NOT explained well in the series.

Or even gotten right, for that matter.  Go right ahead.  Truly believe that the door isn't there in your new reality, then punch right where it was as hard as you can.  You will break your hand.  This is what philosophers call Truth.  We feel the door, we see the door, we can't unwill the concept of ""door"" from being.  So the door IS.  We can affect it in the framework of our reality (moving it, opening it, breaking it, etc.), but we cannot unmake it through will alone.

*Spoiler*

Further thing that irked me was all the thrown away characters.  Asuka's a perfect example.  A likable troubled cutie, she provides the needed counterpart and love interest for Shinji.  Yet in the end all past history goes out the window and she's relegated to lying alone in a hospital bed.  What the hell?!  Real people don't act like this!  While Shinji's busy professing his love for some alien GUY he just met, Asuka (who he spent WEEKS getting attached to and actually kissed) is lying alone in bed desperately needing someone to prove to her she's NOT unwanted and alone.  That's all!

Was I the only one who saw the resolution of the series as totally unnecessary?  Over half the characters are constantly whining about how alone they are.  Yet when Asuka NEEDS them, they basically drug her up, strap her down, and tell her to take off.  Shinji does the same dang thing to Misato, though she deals with it better.  Lame to the max.  Totally unrealistic of what longterm human relationships are like.  I don't care how cold and removed you are.  Robots have more compassion and rational thought.

News flash here, if someone you care about's lonely and YOU are lonely, all you have to do is go and be there for em.  Then, amazingly enough, you both aren't so alone anymore!  It's that classic ""free your mind, your a**'ll follow"" thing.  Evangelion totally skirts this simple solution, and in doing so it leaves a gaping hole that makes the end plot totally unlikely to EVER happen as we're supposed to believe it does.

Series finale was executed weakly at best.  None of the aforementioned underpinning philosophies were adequately described.  What you're left with is a confusing, ridiculous montage that culminates in a lackluster conclusion to an otherwise great series.

It almost seems to me that midseason they switched writers and hired a terminally depressed guy to write the script.  Better bust out your psychedelic drugs at the end, cuz that's about the only way the conclusion will be satisfying.  Heck, it may even make some remote semblance of sense, then.  ""By repeating what people have been saying to me over and over again, I suddenly come to grips with myself and make the whole universe bend to my whims!  No matter that I deserted my loved ones when they needed me most!""

Yeah.  Right.  Pull the other one.  You'll notice the Greeks with their cave never said that the individual could alter the cave or the outside world in any way, merely the individual's PERCEPTION of that reality.  They at least understood that.

Evangelion left me feeling confused and unsatisfied at its conclusion, which is sad because I LOVED the first and middle sections of the series.  The last half the characters become inhuman and unrational to extremes, and that killed it for me.  Classic case of ""the message"" ruining a perfectly good story.

My fix for this?  Admit that the Truth of the universe is concrete.  Admit it can't be manipulated beyond the limits of our biology and the Truth of a human existence.  Have Kaji die WITH Misato rather than stupidly avoiding her.  Have Ritsuko date the good looking guitar playin' tech, the fact she's sleeping with someone her hated mother did is beyond the realm of belief.  Have Shinji actually GROW as a character.

And for god's sake, have him walk in after defeating the 13th Angel and plant a scorcher on Asuka for some REAL dang resolution.

To quote Myth Busters, ""I reject your reality, and substitute my own!""  Sorry, but as those guys prove time and again, we humans cannot do that.

Have recently watched all of RahXephon.  From my personal opinion, just skip Eva altogether and get that.  You'll end up depressed as hell after Eva, so unless you REALLY like mecha it's like punching yourself in the head.  You might as well just stop and feel better. RahXephon explained their underpinnings MUCH better, it looked better (the Mu are frickin awesome), had more likable characters, and the ending was pretty good resolution.  Let's face it, after 26 episodes you actually will want to see a closer that shows how it all winds up.  From a user friendly standpoint I feel Rah's got Eva beat in all aspects.  Eva may've done it first, but RahXephon did it right.",1133740800,11,6115,4.691800188501413
2200805,5,B000767QTA,"The changes in the Platinum version of Evangelion from the Perfect Collection are small, with four director's cut episodes and commentary. (I received an e-mail recently, which noted I left out 5.1 sound and better picture quality, though than anime still looks washed and the sound is only clear in surround sound). But, they are changes in what is perhaps one of the best animes ever created, and to fans, that is more than enough to spend their money.

If that wasn't enough for you then, then here is your opportunity. Take it from someone who thrives off of these thin-pack box sets. The value of them is beyond compare. All of them have sturdy boxes with artwork on them. You get entire series for what is usually half the price you would spend buying the entire series, and you save on shelf-space. In this case, where there were seven DVDs in the entire series that go for $27 a pop (7 x 27 = 189 plus tax and possibly shipping), you'll end up saving big. How can you beat that?

I recommend this for anyone who doesn't have the original box set and for fans of anime of the highest quality. This is the best giant-robot anime, one of the top ten ever, and will go down as something magical and important in anime in the same way that Akira did. Plus, I recommend this for the value itself (7 x 27 = 189 - 48 = 141 = How can you beat that?).

(ADDED LATER) I've received a lot of e-mail regarding the extra features, inserts, and DVD count, so I'm going to address these issues now. Firstly, there is only six DVDs, but the episodes are condensed into the six so there is no need to worry about that. The final disc contains the director's cut episodes. Also, there are few extras on the disc, and in case you enjoy the inserts that tend to come with DVDs, the DVDs in the box set won't have them.",1131926400,250,1805,4.302941176470588

Ep. 24: The Beginning and the End, or 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door
Ep. 25: Do you love me?

But to be fair to some of these sellers, they know they can make a profit off this by doing it this way. To this day, NGE is still high in demand, and the higher in demand it is, the more likely people will open their wallets to any deal thrown at them.

Guys, there is another way to obtain this series without having to pursue this option. Go through an extensive search on Amazon and buy each of the platinum collections separately. Trust me, the price of the first platinum collection is only around 3 dollars, 3 DOLLARS. That's a great deal! The highest I've seen one platinum collection charged is only around $25.00.

If you go this route, you'll end up saving a lot more. I believe NGE should be easily accessible to the anime viewing public, and I don't want to see other people spend too much on it.",1402099200,4,1117,4.497536945812808

It's late in the game for this series, and hope the potential buyer can find this review. I was asking myself, as I suspect many of you are, what the differences are between each set.

(keeping it dummed down, and to only sets I see on Amazon. Since there's been countless re-releases/reboxes)

*Anything ""platinum"" is the latest re-master, and so will be the best quality you can get, and will also includes the Directors Cut episodes.

NGE: Perfect Collection - Original release, remastered from VHS. Worst video quality.

NGE: Platinum Collection - Were several releases of this collection, but only see 1 on Amazon, the ""Thin Pack Set"". BUT, no extras (other than directors cut episodes) or even slip in inserts/art for cases. Literaly just thin pack and disk.

NGE: Platinum: Perfect Collection - Tin case. ""Platinum disks"" with ""perfect"" disk cases. These are the full size cases, so you're getting the newest disks with the art/inserts/extras you don't with the thin packs. Outragous $$$

NGE: Limited Holiday Special - Platinum Collection re-release includes extras than Thin Packs dont. *I Think* it is a single case w/ several inserts to hold all the DVDs.

Bottom Line: Get ""Platinum"". This series is old, and you'll be forking a lot of $$ to get anything good condition. Someone in an EVA Forum recommended the Thin Pack Set due to best quality, So that's what I bought.",1369958400,9,1617,4.812274368231047
2200833,5,B000767QTA,This anime series is probably the best anime series I have ever seen. And I've seen a good amount of them. Its extremely in depth and the characters are all likeable in their own weird way. Sometimes certain episodes have these strange scenes where the characters just stare at eachother for an extremely long time and its kind of awkward. But the storyline is unbelievably in depth and creative. You won't regret diving into this one. But you have to get the movie The End of Evangelion because that movie contains the last two episodes.,1369353600,,538,4.673684210526316
2200834,3,B000767QTA,"**WARNING! Spoilers are ahead! I recommend you skip this review until you've seen the series. Don't say I didn't warn you!**
First off, I have to give this anime credit, as it was able to suck me in and make me interested during the beginning; something animes sometimes have trouble doing. I continued to be intrigued up through the first half. The characters were quirky and interesting, and the fights with the angels were fun (including one battle where Shinji and Asuka danced one to death), though most of the angels seemed lazy and uninspired (one of them is literally a floating sphere. Real intimidating...). After the first half is where things started to crumble. Characters changed dramatically, stripping them of everything that made them likeable. Shinji turned into a praise-hungry brat, Asuka into a scared little child, Misato into a whiny crybaby. They even tack on an overly dramatic back story for Asuka that honestly isn't necessary.
For those of you who don't know (although you probably do), Evangelion is heralded as one of the all-time greatest classics of anime history. The hype is the reason I watched it in the first place. And honestly, I'm extremely disappointed. What I found here wasn't bad by any means, but I don't think it's deserving of all the hype it got. The setup is good, the characters are good (in the beginning), and it's even got a great theme song (although it's no ""You Get to Burning""), but the good things fall apart near the end. You have all these loose ends that you expect to be tied up in the last two episodes, and they waste the time by putting the characters in a fantasy setting where they attend school together, among other things, not to mention that the final ending is like the director flipping you the bird. Nothing is resolved. Also, I swear this anime was written for immature preteens. The opening contains nude silhouettes of the female characters in provocative poses (although I know it can be common-place in anime), and some of the dialogue is just silly. There's an awkward scene where Misato and her boyfriend are making love and she says (actual quote): ""No, don't put strange objects in THAT!"". The show also tackles yaoi themes. I have no problem with this, but Shinji and the love interest share only about three scenes together, and Shinji admits to loving him. This is more like a Disney Princess love than anything else (think like in Enchanted, when not three minutes after the prince meets Giselle, he announces that he is going to marry her). This anime isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it great, and I don't think it warrants a second viewing from me. Now, for a REAL anime masterpiece (in my opinion), I suggest checking out Metropolis, anything Studio Ghibli, Bubblegum Crisis, Akira, Read or Die (the OVA and TV series), etc.
Now, about some other things. This series is/was licensed by ADV (I think they've gone out of business), the same company who did the wonderful English dub of Martian Successor Nadesico. The English dub for this was awful. I'm sure the story is continued in the movies, but I can't say I care much for the characters anymore anyway (and I would also like to avoid the hospital scene in End of Evangelion at all costs). To me, there's no real reason to buy this for keeps unless you can find it dirt cheap.",1363996800,,3319,4.70446735395189

The fact that people can come away from this show with so many varying opinions can be held as testament to the influence and impact of Evangelion. Regardless of positive or negative opinions, it is pretty well documented that you will come away from Evangelion feeling something.
 Now, as for the series itself, the plot actually runs pretty formulatic. The electic cast will be experiencing a normal day of school, or secret pilot tests, until something goes wrong and an enemy (known as Angels) shows up and everyone is put to the test of finding a way to overcome and defeat the enemy. There are some cool and entertaining battle sequences to be found here, but, at the end of the day, Neon Genesis Evangelion isn't really about the giant robot versus the giant monster battles, it is about the characters. The simple plot of robots against the monsters is supported and maintained by the carefully crafted and intricate character interactions and later on the pyschological studies of the characters.
 As for the product itself, this plantium collection contains all 26 episodes of the orignial series and an extra disc with some director cut episodes. The package is clean and sexy, displaying pilot Rei on one side and her foil character, Asuka, on the other. Anyone interested in anime, or just excellent entertainment in general, owes it to themselves to make sure they have this collection in their own.

His father tells him he must pilot a giant humanoid robot to protect the world from the invading angels. The angels and the Evangelion that Shinji pilots both have a secret. They were both alternate possibilities of humanity in the when the world began. There are many dark secrets and conspiracies afoot behind the scenes. Shinji has some major psychological issues and they are compounded when he meets his fellow pilots Rei and Asuka. Evangelion is the story of Shinji, and his fight to save the world and find happiness.

This is a very deep anime. You could watch it over and over, but still find a different meaning every time. The story is very heavy. The emotions of each characters are explored in depth. It's an older series, but the animation, voice acting, and music are all top notch. It is a near perfect series. My only beef with it is the final episode. The final episode is pretty much a psych evaluation of the main characters. When I first saw this series, I hated it b/c of the ending. Since then they have released ""Death and Rebirth"", and ""The End of Evangelion"". They wrap everything up very nicely. Evangelion is incredible and this is a great box set. You should check it out.

2200846,5,B000767QTA,"In my opinion, this is a great series. I haven't really watched to0 much anime to give a fair assessment about its place in anime history, but speaking from just a one series stand point, this show is certainly worth purchasing.  I won't give any plot details as many reviewers have already covered that but the storyline is a great one.  There are plot holes and, if you are like me, a person that questions everything, many questions you'll ask will never be answered and, in fact, any attempt at a resolution on your part will end up in contradiction.  But that aside, I truly believe that the heart of story is not about humans struggling to fight angels in a post apocalyptic world but revolves around low self esteem depressed Shinji and his struggles to find happiness and his place in the world. Braching from this main theme, other characters psychological states are examined making teh story, imo, a somewhat philosophical comment on the need for other people and finding your truth through the clash between other people's truths. I believe the ending provides evidence for this. So, if this sort of style appeals to you, I think you will love teh show.

Had that movie been included in this set it may have been the definitive version to own but those movie rights are rather expensive. Visual and audio quality are good, and the set contains both English and Japanese audio for the viewer to choose.

2200849,3,B000767QTA,"Shinji Ikari is just a regular boy living life until his father summons him to pilot ""Unit 1"" of an Eva under the paramilitary organization ""Nerv"". Nerv's mission is to destroy all the Angels to prevent a Third Impact. On the darker side of the plot, Shinji has his own personal conflicts in life. He is unloved by his father, who appears to be using him only as a tool for his own purposes. All the characters in this story have deep and dark pasts of their own - and at the end they seem to be intertwined with each other's psychological tragedies.

I'm usually the type to go for dark stories, but NGE is just too dull. The first half of the anime is angel attack after angel attack...is that all this is going to be about? Each episode acts like ""we are all going to die"" and of course, through some miracle, they are always saved. After awhile, it just makes the story drag on. It didn't start getting good until Episode 18 when it started to really delve into the psychologies and pasts of the main characters. I was let down again in the last two episodes when everyone's inner-selves were put to the test - it just kept going on and on. In the last ten minutes of it, I didn't even understand what was going on, it was so mixed up.

Overall, I think this anime is definitely worth a try since I know the majority of people like it. Unfortunately, I was part of the minority. I had to admit though, the graphics were impressive and I did like the characters, just not so much the plot. The music really irritated me but I really enjoyed the Japanese voice cast.

This series, however, does have some maturity; as it happens the series occassionally becomes drama-ish, focusing heavily on characters and dedicating large amounts of screentime. In the early and late episodes, the drama almost seems like Evangelion's main focus.

Surprisingly, the middle episodes are somewhat light hearted which actually was an excellent decision. Giving the audience good times with the cast means we really care about them and when bad things happen it stikres the audience hard. Additionally, the super robot battles portray the ""life of death"" aspects realistically since any attack from both the robots and invading creatures is generally intended to be fatal or at least debilitating, as opposed to wearing the enemy down, then unleashing a distinct ""finishing"" attack.",1299628800,,912,5.507142857142857

Honestly while I enjoy it, I really don't get it... as a matter of fact no one I know or talked to about it gets anything about the show except the basic plot of children piloting ""robots"" (I know they are not robots but I don't know what else to call them) fighting angels.

2200857,4,B000767QTA,"In the interest of full disclosure I should make clear that I am an Eva fan. I own this, the Movie, Rebuild of Evangelion, and the ""Angelic Days"" manga. But I am not here sell you on my fandom, I'm here to review this product free from bias. If you've managed to go this entire time avoiding spoilers for the series, then I'll do you a favor and write this review spoiler free.

Neon Genesis Evangelion centers on Shinji Ikari, a 14-year old boy who has been drafted into piloting a giant robot called ""Evangelion Unit 01,"" and protecting his new home, Tokyo-3, from mysterious beings known as ""Angels.""

Eva feels very blue-collar at the start. NERV, the government agency that created the Evangelions, is very bureaucratic. Unlike a Gundam pilot that does whatever he wants, Shinji has a boss, Misato, who has a boss herself, who has bosses ordering him around. The Evangelion is battery powered and has a regular riffle with bullets that doesn't run on sunshine and magic. Whenever something goes wrong, there's a stack of papers on Misato's desk. You might scoff and say, ""That's stupid,"" but it gives Eva a different ""flavor"" that makes it unique.

The second half of the series is infamous around the anime world, as we see the characters steadily lose control over their own lives. Asuka, the second Eva pilot, starts off as a jerk that thinks she should be in charge, heads into bitchy territory before trauma ruins her career. The rest of the cast spirals into similar dark territory.

So, if I like it so much, why did I give it Four Stars? Because the ending sucks. The ending is even more infamous around the world. Fact is that the animation studio ran out of money and had put together the last two episodes out of clips and still shots. What we get is the cast sitting in a chair discussing their psychological problems. It's cleaver insight into the characters, but it's presented in such a boring way that it drags down the rest of the series.

The real ending is the appropriately titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-The-End-Of-Evangelion/dp/B000068OJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End Of Evangelion</a>. You're supposed to discount the two offending episodes (25 and 26), and watch the movie instead. But, you got to buy it separately,  and it's as much a head-scratcher as the rest of Evangelion.

""What about the Rebuild of Evangelion series?"" You might be asking, ""Should I get this or that?"" Rebuild is a complete reboot/remake of the series. It's not an HD clean-up /recut like Dragonball Z Kai. It's completely redone animation. Even though it starts the same as regular Eva, it's going to go in a different direction with new characters added. And, because it's a movie, the pacing is different.

Lastly, let me give you a hints to help you enjoy this series more: there is no ""Deep Mysteries of Eva."" You're going to hear some religious terms thrown around throughout the series ""Angels."" ""Deadsea Scrolls,"" ""Adam,"" and more. These don't mean anything. It's not a religious allegory. It's not a metaphor. Eva was made entirely for a Japanese audience, without any idea that it would ever be seen outside Japan. Those were just fancy foreign words thrown into the scripts to make it more mysterious to the audience. No one was counting on anyone trying to look up what it all means.",1284940800,2,3406,4.9423076923076925
2200858,2,B000767QTA,"The whole movie is about how the child ""hero"" of the movie can't connect with his maniacal father, and he whines about it incessantly.  He moves in with an older woman who is used as the foil to bring out double innuendos and panty-shots.

The artwork is great, the GFR's are well thought out, and the bad guys are cool.

2200861,5,B000767QTA,"Revivisisted(2/26/12)
How do I start a review of my favorite anime, nay, favorite show of all time?

Evangelion starts out deceptively simple. Watching it the first time in 2009 I couldn't help but snicker at the goofy designs of some of the enemy monsters (known as ""angels""), roll my eyes at some questionable nudity, and thought the plot involving giant robots - Evangelions, Evas for short - and adolescent pilots was kind of childish. What kept me watching the first few episodes was almost exclusively the characters, imperfect characters which were whiny, cowardly, depressed, cold, obnoxious, and above all, real and lovable (okay, sometimes not) despite all their faults. There is so much anime out there with characters who could be described as cool, confident, and who eventually triumph over all evil, characters which are in my mind, wooden; if you're looking for that, this is not the show for you.

Around the halfway point in the show the main cast finally starts to get their lives and emotions in check, only to fall even deeper into the depths of despair than ever before. We then get a few questions answered, ""Why do children have to pilot the Evas?"", only to leave tenfold more unanswered. The finale in ep25-26 is truly bizarre, right at its climax the show decides to ditch it's narrative in favor of completing each main character arch in a dialogue and psychology ridden clip-show featuring recycled animation (due to budget, time restraints, and the fact they couldn't show what they wanted to on Television).

This show is overall very difficult to describe, elements of practically every genre abound. There are plenty of moments full of comedy, action, angst, sexual tension, and psychological terror; above all it's probably best described as a story about life and finding a purpose and overcoming depression. It is an immensely personal story because the director himself was clinically depressed prior, and he supposedly added parts of himself into every character in the show. Because of all this many people have labeled the show something along the lines of ""pretentious garbage"" and you know, I completely understand why, I love it all the same!

This platinum collection has the original Japanese or English dub audio and no additional features except some previews for other anime available from ADV Entertainment. If you ask me, the dub is actually pretty good (after a rocky start) and is almost as enjoyable as the original Japanese. The show is not for children as it contains intense violence, nudity, sexual situations, and mild language, I'd give it an R-rating.

A more satisfying ending is ""The End of Evangelion"", a feature film about the events before and after the final two episodes, some would call it an alternate ending I view them as two angles of the same story, both vital. Unfortunately, this film was produced by Manga Entertainment, so it's not found in this set. I recommend watching or downloading it online because finding a good copy of the original DVD these days is nigh impossible. Just one warning though, this is one crazy movie which is a little more explicit and terrifying than anything in the TV series, but it's worth it and you will walk away with an experience you will never forget.",1260921600,,3262,4.945255474452555
2200862,3,B000767QTA,"I disagree with some of the customer's reviews. Being from the 90's the series, at that time, was very well made. Very good animation, the color and drawings are good, well over average for a TV series from the 90's. If you look at it today it won't be as good as many other series but still keep in mind this is not a movie or an OAV, this is a TV series. The quality in after episode 13/14 has gone down, producers and director had a very tough time at keeping up with the production schedule and they were actually running out of funds. It is anyway one of the most famous and original mecha series u'll ever see. The packaging is not great but i found it for $39 and I'm not complaining especially because you also get the director's cut of the last 4 episodes plus some extras. The english voices are awful though (talking about adaptation the italian version is probably the best worldwide, right after the original japanese version...but Dynamic Italia had some kind of special agreement with Gainax) so I actually watch the japanese version with english subtitles. it is actually quite a good release, especially if u can buy it for less than 40 bucks.",1260144000,,1160,4.476415094339623

2200865,5,B000767QTA,"Evangelion is a very deep and mystifying series, one you will have to watch several times in order to properly  understand. There are many ways to go about doing that, and here I'll give you an idea of the best way to do it. This collection is definitely the one you want if you're buying. First of all it is compact, fitting the entire series and director's cut episodes into six discs, opposed to some of the other sets with 8 discs. Second of all the episodes are remastered, an asset in the visuals department, also very necessary while watching this groundbreaking series. The last advantage (and it is a big one) is that this set is among the cheaper of the sets, as opposed to the new ""Holiday Collection"" and ""Perfect Collections"" for roughly 50 dollars more.

My advice for if you want to get into the series is to get this and the End of Evangelion. It is a much more suitable ending to the series and it's definitely something you should have to go with this set. The best way to go about watching it is to watch the first 4 discs of the set as you usually would, and when you get to the fifth disc skip it and watch the sixth. It contains the director's cut episodes of the first four episodes on disc five and sets itself up for the End of Evangelion. Once you've watched disc six watch End of Evangelion, I found it to be a more suitable and satisfying end to the series. However there is nothing wrong with the last two episodes found on disc five and I do advise that you watch them eventually, because they're very artistic and an interesting variation of the ending. You will likely get the most out of the series if you watch it in the order specified, and then you will have it to watch several times over and fully appreciate. If you're serious about wanting to watch Evangelion, that's the way to go. If you're willing to cough up more cash you may be able to get the same features in the bigger collections albeit with a few bonus features, but you'll have to decide if it is worth the price.",1248998400,4,2015,4.313984168865435

Video no longer has the occasional jerkiness that sometimes plagued the previous release and the sound has been remastered to 5.1.

2200870,1,B000767QTA,"This series began with a simple, almost stupid concept involving giant mecha-Angels attacking New Japan and little kids who can sync up with Evas to fight them.

The mere logic and mechanics behind these battles is infuriating in how ridiculously off-the-wall bat**** insane they are.  It seems like in every single battle with every single angel, without fail, one or all of the Evas is brutally and gruesomely damaged almost beyond repair, and every little scheme or superweapon developed by NERV has a chance of success dangling near the 1% mark.  It started to become a running joke for me to laugh when a gigantic super-laser that would suck up half the country's power supply to fire one shot had something like a ""0.00000018167%"" chance of success, and they just go ""fire it anyway"", and it somehow works on the second shot.

But the real shining star of the series was the character interaction, particularly between Shinji, Asuka, and Rei.  They had adorable moments together, and lots of school-aged sexual tension that never got raunchy or disgustingly over the top.

Then around the early-middle of the series, this sort of interaction started to lessen, as the characters became less well-rounded, and more stereotypical caricatures of their sex, and then later of mental illnesses.

Shinji went from a shy, sweet young boy desperate for his father's attention, to something resembling a schizophrenic who lives only for praise, and then when he receives said praise, he accuses the praisers of lying to him just to make him go and fight in the Eva.

Asuka was my favorite character, and she was most like me with her sassy attitude and hitting people-ness.  Then they start digging up this backstory of her mother going insane, and beginning to think a doll is her actual daughter Asuka, and ignoring the real Asuka as ""that other girl"", culminating in Asuka coming home from school to find her mother has hanged herself and the doll.

It would have been interesting to explore this effect on Asuka IF and ONLY IF it had been properly researched and gone into minor psychology from which Asuka could overcome this problem or fall to despair from it.

Instead, she just goes crazy, moping around like Shinji, and generally acting ""decidedly"" unpredictable, in that her actions seem to be only motivated by plot convenience.

Rei Ayanami had a chance to be someone who would stand out, who would somehow, despite not being an individual (spoiler alert) would somehow break out of that shell with Shinji's help and establish herself as her own person.  This entire subplot was being established every time Shinji tried to emotionally connect with her.

Misato Katsuragi was humorous and interesting enough on her own, but then they give her an unresolved-relationship-end thing dealy with that other guy.  This had the makings of a typical romantic comedy-drama, but since the whole series devolved into a series of caricatures of mental illnesses, she becomes insane and obsessive and a cliche' stereotype of a ""hysterical woman"".

The Blonde woman (whose name I forgot) simply goes insane, and thinks her mother's spirit lives on in the Three Magi machines, and starts to talk to them like they're her mother.  Also, she was apparently raised with ""traditional japanese values"", which means she believes women are a completely different species from men, and thus somehow it is impossible for them to relate.

Everyone else who was formerly a real character simply becomes a canvas upon which a depressed artist paints what he believes to be real and relevant portraits of the worst of humanity, but only show that this artist has not done his research, and has no experience with the human condition to understand how a person falls to their bad experiences, and what they do to overcome or get run down by them.  Everyone in this series is simply a convenient prop piece for the artist's bitter message on how humanity is trash.

But that is including the ""End of Evangelion"" ending.

The original show earns one star from me for its ending, one which should have been kept.  In it, Shinji, in a surrealist sort of place, struggles with his internal demons, and eventually overcomes, realizing that he has control over his life, and he is suddenly surrounded by all the characters of the series, applauding him overcoming his whiny man-child emo shell and becoming a real, well-rounded person once more.

The messages in this series had great potential, but were poorly executed by a storyline which seemed to have been either written by entirely different people mid-way through, or was being steadily transformed by a depressed director who was probably not involved in the final episode, judging by how he went and changed it in ""End of Evangelion"".

Either way, despite the good character design, initially great character chemistry and development, and initially interesting concepts and philosophy, it completely fell apart from its message, and became gratuitously overbearing and pretentious, with a severely narrow-ranging view of the sexes, and rather childish sexism you expect in disillusioned pubescent adolescents without a proper guiding hand in their development.",1233878400,15,5194,5.04088785046729

2200874,5,B000767QTA,"I had heard bits and pieces about this anime since I started collecting cels. I always recognized them because they are probably some of the most expensive anime cels out there. Even so I had never seen the anime, but I heard from many others that it was a great timeless anime. Now I don't have a specific genre of anime I like, just whatever happens to come my way, which seems to be giant robot ones and sci fi ness. So I took a chance when Best Buy put the series set on sale and bought it. It actually sat on my shelf for several months until recently.

Spoilers may be below.

The anime is about a boy named Shinji who is selected as the third child to pilot the Evangelion(robot) 001. He is pretty depressed about it but pilots it anyway. He and 2 other pilots Rei and Asuka all fight these monsters called Angels. During the anime Shinji goes through a great deal of stress and emotion wondering why he is here and what his lifes meaning is. Despite being an action packed series it is very psycological. The series ends abruptly with Shinji's mind wandering in itself.

I have to say I was never expecting to enjoy this anime as much as I did. It really was brilliantly done in almost all aspects of it. The music was enjoyable and the characters were very human. Shinji the main character is very depressing, but in that aspect of him it seems how a real person would be acting. Even though the robots or Eva's as they're referred to are a big part of the story they don't overshadow the human characters. The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending of the anime. The last 2 episodes got really confusing to the point where I had no idea what was going on. Lots of still images and flashing. I was really happy to see the ending much better explained in the Evangelion movie End of Evangelion.

The dvds in this set are in slim cases which I am not a fan of. But the dvds themselves seem to be of good quality. I'm happy with the purchase. Overall I really enjoyed the anime and am happy that I did. I am really looking forward to the 4 new movies coming out over the next few years.",1229558400,,2107,4.233830845771144
2200875,4,B000767QTA,"Don't let the picture of the box set fool you. This is not season 2 of Evangelion!

I was ready to rate this review with one star. But i decided to rate it based on its overall content. ADV for the most part has released decent and consistent anime. Their original dubbing during the VHS tape era was poor, but i think they have improved drastically over the years. Their box sets can be a bit pricey and i only purchase them when a huge sale is going on, because i refuse to pay full retail price. But when they have a HOT title they know typically SELLS, they will have no problem JACKING up the RETAIL price for no reason at all. Same thing does for DN Angel and NOIR.

I know there was so much hype around this series. I actually don't see what the big deal was? We had Dual Parallel and Rahxephon which were all similar to this series about a boy being able to control a robot. This one i guess was the most popular of the three and i am sure countless others.

But overall this is a good series and has a lot to offer anime fans and new anime fans alike. The only difference with this box set is that you get the Evangelion movie. Which is a great idea! But they've released so many Evangelion box sets that the movie should have been included with prior releases. But ADV has a huge habit of double dipping as do other companies. Definitely pick this title up. I know you won't be disappointed.",1228867200,4,1401,4.181481481481481
2200876,2,B000767QTA,"This 'holiday' set of landmark anime Neon Genesis Evangelion is part of publisher ADV's new financial recovery strategy. They've put most of their catalog out of print, and are now reissuing every show in new boxes, a few at a time. On its own, there's no problem with this strategy. However, in order to cut costs, they've abandoned their traditional art box and thin-pak case setup in favor of the ugly, economy-style brick cases that other companies have used in the past. The company's prices have always been a little higher due to these elaborate boxes; so once again, this might have been acceptable if they actually reduced the price of this set. However, instead the price has been SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED.

So what the consumer ends up with is a LOWER QUALITY PRODUCT AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE. ADV has always regarded Eva as a perpetual cash cow, so the price has always been a little higher for it. But this is just arrogant, especially for a company on the verge of collapse. ADV has stated (and it's also displayed on the packaging) that these Holiday sets are available only until the new year, when they'll be put out of print temporarily and reissued again; quite possibly in the much nicer art box format. My question to them is, what's the point of this?

If you have yet to buy Eva, or you intend to purchase it as a gift for someone this Holiday season, then you're much better off tracking down the still widely-available&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Platinum-Collection/dp/B000767QTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection</a>.

The picture and sound quality on these discs blows the old set's quality out of the water, and the convenient packaging saves a ton of space on my shelf (nothing really to do with the DVDs I know, but just a personal note there). Above all, the 4 director's cut episodes are actually quite well worth it with some very interesting footage (some flat-out creepy i might add!). Out of the 5 characters that were re-dubbed for this occasion, only 1 really needed it, but whatever.

I swear some people are only happy when thier miserable, if you're one then this is the show for you. On a more postive note, the show has several hilarious moments which will have you rolling around in stitches, plus it has some amazing fight sequences.

Only thing holding it back from a 5 star is the lack of the movie End of Evangelion with it, but really its no big deal.",1219363200,,343,4.375
2200882,4,B000767QTA,"Based on the reviews I've read so far it would seem that when one decides to delve into the world of anime they will eventually come upon this series.  While I did not give this a full five stars, I can definitely see why it is praised highly.  On the flip side I can also see why a few people disliked it, thanks to the way the series ended.  Regardless, I personally found it a very enjoyable series, but I don't think it's the greatest thing ever made.  Not to me at least.  I'll admit that at first I had a little trouble getting into the characters, but once I did I was definitely into the whole series.  Shinji is just such a hard guy to like watching sometimes.

Anyway, Neon Genesis Evangelion puts us in a world that is nearly destroyed.  The reason this happened is because of these strange beings called ""angels"".  The show takes us on quite an adventure centered on a boy named Shinji who has a destiny to fulfill.  The series opens with an attack by one of these angels and Shinji is caught in the midst of it, but is due to be picked up by someone.  She is charged to bring him back to the secret government base his father works at called Nerv.  Needless to say she succeeds, since its episode one and we wouldn't have much of a series if the main character died there.  Anyway, Shinji will prove to be instrumental in the defeat of these angels thanks to a machine his father built called the Eva.  They are sort of like giant robots, which is why I would class this as a Mecha, but the Evas have an organic/genetic component in their designing (you find out more about this towards the end of the series and I won't ruin the full breadth of the revelation for you).  Anyway, Shinji, never having piloted one of these machines before, refuses, but is sort of forced into it and thus his career as an Eva pilot started in the very first episode.  Sounds like most everything is explained huh?  Not in the least, there is SO much more to this series and that's one of the reasons it's so great.  You see there's more than just one Eva in the world and thus more than one pilot because the Eva has to genetically mesh with its pilot so it's a lot more than driving the machines we see in other Mecha or what we find in things like Battletech.  The other requirement is the pilot has to be fourteen.  The other pilot already with us is Rei, but she really was too injured in a prior accident to pilot on that fateful day while seeing her so injured and his fathers immovable lack of compassion, Shinji felt the weight of the battle was on him.

As you can see Shinji's father is not a likeable person and we are shown this in the first episode as well.  From there we are introduced to an array of varying characters, especially when Shinji gets entered into the school at Nerv headquarters.  Shinji is sort of out of touch with reality, but still wants something out of it, so he's kind of in between.  Rei on the other hand is completely removed and she's more like a robotic human just going through the motions.  We see a couple hints of her humanity show up every now and again, but she does come across as incredibly bright and observant.  Later we become introduced to the third pilot from Germany, Ayako.  She was one of my favorites next to Rei and she's very in touch with the world.  She's very engaged with the world around her and she's very motivated to be an Eva pilot, unlike Shinji who doesn't want to be and Rei who just does as she's told.  Despite the action sequences where the Evas have to face the Angel enemies there is a major dramatic component to this series that focuses on how these children have to deal with their very intense responsibility.  One wonders how the mind of someone so young can truly cope with what they're doing.

If you're really just in it for the action you might not get as into this because the dramatic sequences are just as necessary and on screen just as much.  In fact, on some levels, I felt like there was sometimes too much action.  From the way they present the story it seems like an Angel attack is a rare occurrence, but in almost every episode there's an attack.  Our characters don't even get a rest to deal with their social problems or the problems they have to deal with in their job.  Shinji clearly has the most mental stress because he's now under the command of a father who doesn't even seem to like him and favors Rei over his own son!  Rei... who isn't even his daughter!  As you can see there's a lot of strife and struggle for this, but Shinji's father has a lot to deal with as well, especially when it comes to those who control Nerv called Seele.  This doesn't change the fact that he seems to be a very immoral person, especially when we see the background episodes.

That pretty much covers the premise for episodes one through twenty-four and if you like a dramatic based Mecha with some decent action sequences you'll love this.  However, when we get to the last two episodes things make almost no sense... to the point where the creators have actually already tried to rewrite this ending twice!  I will admit that the last two episodes are awesome, especially on a philosophical/psychological level.  They are absolutely profound and they really moved me to think about things in a very strange and new light.  You can get a lot out of those two episodes if you view them in their own right, however, if you try to put them in conjunction with the rest of the series it makes almost no sense.  On the ""Platinum"" edition of the box set there are director's cut episodes and upon re-watching those I see hints of the ""Human Instrumentality Project"", which is where I think the last two episodes seem to culminate, but again, it really doesn't mesh with the rest at all.  It just leaves us with no sensible conclusion to what was going on with the angels and Nerv in general.  The built up such a mysterious world in the first twenty-four episodes that to have such an off key conclusion... we're just left feeling unsatisfied.  Apparently I'm not the only one who thought these things made no sense, because I've talked to a few other people and they definitely agree.  In the end, after watching these two, I'll call them ""wtf episodes"", I'm left wondering if Shinji just made up this whole thing in his head and it never really happened.  Apparently that's a very real possibility.

The art and premise of the show is very well done.  It just begins to fall apart towards the end and there's no major ending that really turns the light on in our heads to make us understand.  I'm not looking for a blatant hand out, but at least a somewhat logical progression would be nice and this show never really ends that way.  I think it's good for what it is, but I think it had so much potential that never got truly fulfilled.  I realize everything has meaning, I mean they went to the lengths to name the angels and give them REAL angelic names so there must be some relational concept between apocalypse and angels.  After the last two episodes I'm less sure of what that concept is, even though I felt like I was on to something to figuring it out at first.  In the end if you enjoy Mecha's with very deep concepts and drama then you'll love this.  If you like the philosophical aspects found in Anime you'll love the last episodes too, but treating them as separate works seems to make more sense.  Both things are great in their own right, but together it just doesn't flow, if you know what I mean.  It really is difficult to convey in words, especially if you've never seen it before.  I still recommend watching it at least once.",1217894400,,7629,4.380241648898365

I at first thought it was a normal anime with the lame fantasy stuff all the nerds are into. Not true completely. This show digs past that in some of the show, showing develpment of a world thats falling apart on the outside and from within each character. Thats what started drawing me in to the show. Ep. 22 ""Don't Be"", struck a cord with me as Asuka starts turning for the worst into this mental breakdown that is beyond painful and odd. The whole crew is showing signs of battle damage so to speak towards the end in Ep.s 23 and 24. But Nothing was more weird than what happens in Ep's 25 and 26.

Basicly After the final angel is killed Shinji is dealing with the factor he killed someone that he seemed to get very close with. Then in Ep. 25 ""Do You Love Me?"" We are greeted with the introduction of the Human Instrumentality Project, which is more like some sort of mental helping device. Anyways, this show spins off to understand the characters and they pasts and what makes them who they are. Most shocking being Asuka remembering her birth mother hanging from the doorway. Its desturbing and very deep. All comes down to the basic feelings of: being lonely, being hurt, and wanting protection and companyonship.

Ep. 26 ""Take Care of Yourself"" is without a doubt weird. Still In the Instrumentality machine, now the issue is perspective and what makes all man and what drives one self and how to know ones self. We see in one part Shinji in very basic drawn animation form as he gets perfect freedom, but finds out is still awkward and lonely and he still can't understand himself. After going thru a possible reality that is very funny, shinji decides he can find a way to move on and keep living.

Anyways Mind blowing Ep's at the end. Too deep appeantly for Anime folks based on these reviews I've read. So to those outside of the anime belt reading this, if your looking for something truely deep, and more personal, get something with these 2 Ep's on it.

But the box set is so cheap, and other ep's are darn good as well, so why not this box set. The english subtitles are great.

The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star perfect review is because the lack of interviews and extra content. All that's specal is eps 21 thru 24 have had extra animation and *story* added. Still get this.",1205625600,,2585,4.4222689075630255
2200896,4,B000767QTA,"neon genesis evangelion is one of the best anime films i have ever seen. This anime has characters that are extremely easy to relate to and have good personalities which suit the plot and making it easy to understand. I love the fact that it keeps  you hooked by using a sense of mystery as well as it has almost perfect balance with action, mystery, romance, and emotional needs. The performance of the DVD has sincerely outdone itself by using extremely outstanding artwork and the fact that it uses snippets of the bible to help influence the story line and finally i love the fact that it tinkers with the mind and makes you think while watching it.
  On the other hand i have discovered some faults in the dvd. i believe that the anime is a bit too creative and sometimes the use of flashbacks and things like that make the plot complicated and hard to follow. i personally don't agree with some of the moral codes. i recommend to anyone that wants to buy or watch this should pace themselves into watching it so that you can fully enjoy each dvd or episode. This DVD has an extremly reasonable price and may take a while to get to you but it is so worth it. i wrote this review with my friend to help people to buy or not buy this box set.

2200897,5,B000767QTA,"Out of all the Anime I've watched, none have stuck with me in the same way as Neon Genesis Evangelion. With a directing style and plot line that resembles something from a Stanley Kubrick film, this show felt more real and dramatic to me than most other shows I've seen, both in animation and live action.

The plot takes place in the year 2015, after a global-altering event called the Second Impact took place in the year 2000. In this post-Apocalyptic future, 14 year old Shinji Ikari is summoned to Neo Tokyo-3 by his estranged father, the leader of an organization called NERV. He soon learns that humanity is under attack from a strange breed of ""aliens"" codenamed Angels. Mankind's only hope for surivial is for Shinji and a group of other teenagers to pilot his father's creations, gaint human shaped cyborgs called Evangelions.

Although the plot sounds pretty straightfoward, it is anything but. Around episode 14, things start to get weird as NERV and the organization funding it, SEELE, are revealed to be involved in a much deeper conspiracy. Meanwhile, the conflict with the Angels starts to take it's toll on the main characters, who begin to crack under the pressure. By the end of the series, most of the characters have a complete breakdown while the Apocalypse rains down around them.

This set includes remastered versions of the original 26 episodes, and the 4 New Production cut episodes. Unfortunately, the real conclusion, ""the End of Evangelion"", is not included here, but it is available from Manga Entertainment. It is vital that you get that DVD as well for the full experience.

If your interested in watching something light hearted and straightfoward, than this is not the show for you. The plot is complicated, and things get increasingly disturbing as the series continues, and it doesn't always answer some of the mysteries of the plot, giving the viewer enough clues to come to their own conclusions. However, if you're a fan of films such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", than is right up your alley.",1202860800,2,2031,4.861271676300578
2200898,1,B000767QTA,"This is not the worst anime, but it is BY FAR the most over hyped and over rated pile of crap ever conceived and put in a nice box.

This series is directed like a lightning bolt straight at the heart of its primary target: 14 year old boys.

Right from the opening sequence the song sings to the boy: 'young boy, so innocent, become the Legend you were meant to be!', while pictures of nude teen girls roll by in sexual poses, giving promise of a sexual encounter to come.

Each episode follows the same tired old plot sequence we've seen in Anime for the last 30 years: Teenagers called upon to save the world from monsters.  Yawn.  And each episode ends with a Boss encounter, just like the 14 year old boys favorite PS2 side scroller, level up video game.

To further titillate the 14 year old teen boy, his 2 superior officers are 20 something women who like to party and sleep around.  His 2 fellow  ""pilots"" are teen girls, one a brooder the other a flirt.  Each episode sets up at least one, and sometimes multiple sexual fantasys.  One time they have to pilot their robots naked, you know for, um testing purposes.  One time a superior officer is interviewed nude, for no apparent reason.  One time he wrestles with his fellow pilot wearing only a towel so he can fall on her prone and naked with his hand on her breast.  One time the flirty red head pilot explains heat expansion this way: 'If I rub my breasts and make them hot, will they expand or contract?' *insert flirty laugh, tee hee hee*.  Finally his superior officer has an out and out sex scene ""don't insert that in THERE.... moan, moan* but they avoid an adult rating by not showing the action, you just hear it while looking at the coffee cup next to the bed.

Evangelion tries hard to take itself seriously, pretending there is some big plot going on.  But unanswered questions are not a mystery.  Mysteries have clues, shadowy figures and a feeling that you might be able to figure it out if you get one more clue.  Evangelion has no mystery, just unanswered questions.  Take the big mystery of the Monsters attacking Earth.  No clues are given as to why or where they come from.  Lots of characters ask, but no clues are given.  In fact, most of the large so called ""mystery's"" are not resolved by the end of the story.

The graphics are dated and very few fight scenes are memorable.  Many, many times they save money on graphics by having long drawn out dialog while focusing on a static shot of people walking, or a cup, or a long elevator ride from behind.  The mechs are poorly designed and all look the same.  I've been a huge mecha fan for 20+ years and these are nothing more than a humanoid figure with some armor slapped on.  To make it worse, the boss monsters (called ""Angels"" for no apparent reason) are mostly just geometric shapes so its a big guy fighting a cube, or a ball, or a long tube.  Oh noes!  Attack of the cube!  Run away!

The characters are not likable on almost any level and they are all revealed to be psychotic in some way by the end of the story.  The last few episodes strip off all pretense and go straight for the nude scenes and long drawn out explanations of why people do stuff.  Its esoteric and mildly interesting and it would be great to have the characters be more interesting and contemplative in the context of an interesting story, but they finally drop the boring story with no real explanation then spend a couple episodes just recapping Freudian theories about each character.

This is some of the worst crap I've seen in a long, long time and the ratings its gotten make me afraid for SciFi in general and Anime SciFi in particular.  It will be a cold day in hell before I rely on Amazon ratings again.

EDIT: It has been said that this series is just too ""deep"" for some to understand.  They attempt to explain it, using information they've gleaned from Wikipedia and online fan websites.  If the show needs detailed explaining, the writers lost their way, not me.  Long and pointless discussions online try to explain who the Angels are, where the EVA's came from, etc.  Some fans even believe the whole story takes place in one kids head and none of it really happens.  They can't even agree on whats going on...  And if the show really needs a second viewing to understand its greatness, well they better have made it more interesting than this convoluted and boring plot line to justify a second viewing.

Its also been said that the Movie ""End of Evangelion"" ties everything together.. mostly.  The movie also includes a scene of a teen boy masturbating over the corpse of a teen girl.

I forgot to mention that the opening song, ""A Cruel Angel's Thesis"", is the most memorable and brilliant television theme ever to me, as is the opening animation that accompanies it. Like I said, first rate all the way.  That particular verse isn't in the section of the song used to open the show, but I feel it may be the most revealing line of the song.

""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" -or EVA for short- has it's detractors, but I'm afraid I'll never be able to see what they fail to see about this show.  But to each their own, you know?
I just can't get enough of adult science fiction -and animated, no less- that has the cojones to make every character in it a f#&%ed up psychological mess.  That is what's called the real world, baby, and we all live in it whether or not our choices in entertainment acknowledge that fact.  Then there's the second-to-none attention to detail and the endless moral dilemmas that are the hallmark of any truly great adult anime show.  The character's motivations are exceptionally well thought out and their interactions with each other form the true base of a show most would dismiss at a glance as a simple action cartoon.  This is not a robot cartoon; this an exploration of the human mind at it's most basic and disturbing levels.  This is my kind of series.

The final episode -brilliant and deeply unique as it is- takes place entirely inside one character's head and left many (me included) rather cold as far as wrapping things up.  So hardcore EVA fans literally threatened the creator with death until he made a proper conclusion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-The-End-of-Evangelion/dp/B000068OJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End of Evangelion</a>, which is mind-bendingly awesome and unfortuanately not included in tis set.  I'm not condoning death threats or anything, but I am very glad that film got made and it stands as a testament to how much people love this show.  ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is being remade in Japan as we speak as a series of films and a live-action adaptation is on the way as well.  So while we EVA fans have much to look forward to, it never hurts to brush up on our history either.  If you don't own this, buy it.

Dont get me wrong, the animation of it was very well done, and the fact that they got teenagers to go into ""mecha angels"" risking thier lives unwillingly was a great direction to go in, but the character development was not there and the constant whining of sinji, oh my god, the way he was, i felt like a two year old had designed his characteristics.
The show dragged on forever, and what i thought in the first episode was going to be an interesting series ended up making me wanting to stab my eyeballs out so something exciting would actually be happening...

Despite the few light-hearted moments, the overall story is very dense, very emotional, and sometimes, very disturbing and requires a lot of mental processing.  The occasional multiple-stream subtitles makes it even harder to understand.  But at least you can understand the first 24 episodes. If not, try to watch the director's cut in the last disc - they make more sense than the standard episodes.  But WTFs with episodes 25 and 26?  And I have to buy another DVD (EoE) in order to understand it???

(Giving heavy war machinaries with incredibly destructive powers to teenagers who all suffered childhood traumas and are all psychologically challenged is definitely not the way to save humanity)",1195257600,,795,4.9772727272727275
2200916,5,B000767QTA,"The main critiques I seem to notice are ""Shinji is whiny,"" ""same message,"" and ""wth happened at the end of the series."" I think I agree with the director in saying if you've never experienced desperation, detachedness, other feelings associated with existentialism, and basically all those growing up, you probably won't find anything at all in it, or anything useful. I watched some of this a REALLY long time ago (middle school)... for the most part completely went over my head. I only got the giant robots bit which is the first ""layer"" of understanding. Watched again second year of college, but while doing homework so I didn't catch many of the nuances of the plot. I would read later on a site some plot points which I did not even pick up on... I watched it again recently and got SO much more this time around.

The whole focus of Evangelion, I would think (this is my interpretation of it, don't bash me if it's different than yours ><), is on the varying degrees of connectedness between the characters and the quality/number of those connections... more so than ""robots"" (YES I know they're not), religion, and monsters. It's sort of ironic how all these dysfunctional characters are supposed to be the representatives and saviors of humanity. I think this fits in nicely with the synchro rate, because as I see it, the synchro rate is a measure of the connectedness of the soul in the Eva with the pilot... it would explain Shinji's high synchro and Asuka's falling synchro. This strong connection Shinji has with the soul in EVA 01 was the reason why, I think, 01 was so important (versus 00 or 02)... it was a good representation of the connectedness/relationships between people that could be used to save humanity. It's supposed to be ""our"" unique thing that can help us survive (in the sense that it makes humans worth keeping alive) unlike the singular angels/Adam. This is supposed to be ironic because Shinji is terrible at connecting with everyone else.

I also think the characters are grappling with identity, as shown by the identification of who they are ""in relation"" to everyone else (in the series I think that was exemplified by the adding ""rules/restrictions"" like gravity and ground to define who you are...).

So, before I go on some weird tangent with my analysis, a short review. See it for the relationships. Has cool action sequences as well but that's an aside. Great characters, somewhat confusing but engrossing plot (I am not sure if he meant to give so few hints as to what happening or not), very existential, if you like that sort of thing. It's somewhat along the lines of The Stranger (L'etranger), if you've read that. I think some of the fan service is actually a part of the story as the main character IS a preteen and preteens DO go through puberty. It's a part of life. While it seems like it may be for teens (I think the director geared it that way, what with the few silly situations) I don't think you can have a good appreciation of it, and a good handle of the philosophy and story until you're older. I think this was a mistake of the director as children (yes... I think as preteen I should have been called a child) wouldn't possibly be able to understand some of the other things going on besides battles.

(By the way, Shinji cries because he IS a weak character. But I also think it shows a certain weakness to deride others because they are weak. While I know this is just a character it's very disrespectful. I'm a girl and I love strong characters too as I'm fiercely independent, but saying someone is a ""wuss"" when they have emotional problems is a low blow.)",1192406400,2,3629,4.6217054263565895

Artists who drew the so called ""Angels"" exhausted their creativity in chapter 02, where the only ""nice battle"" takes place, the rest of the ""Angels"" and the battles are exponentially more ridiculous with every chapter (It seems japanese had no more creativity and included some children's drawings).
Why do japanese have an obsession for nuclear explosions? I liked them, however, along with the audio effects.
The Eva pilots: Teenagers in too tight clothes, which might be a certain sort of ""fantasy"" for some people or the source of anger for others. Do Power Rangers wear so tight cloths? I don't think so, I should've noticed. Nudity? Sexual content? Violence? OK, a bit of white underwear from time to time, nothing to be afraid of, very brief, inoffensive compared to what people can see nowaday in a TV ad, an MTV/VH1 video or the Transformers movie.
The plot is not too bad, all the story could be told in a single tiny chapter, or could be either be written in the back of the box.
The use of certain Christian/Catholic symbols/names/references may be annoying or disgusting for some people, I had no problem.
Fan service? Hey, where is it? At the end of each chapter the narrator (Miss Misato?) says the next chapter will have ""fan service too"", perhaps I bought the Censored Platinum Collection or the translation is wrong, or, will there be an Uncensored Director's Cut Platinum Collection?

2200928,5,B000767QTA,"Despite haters of the show, you can't really escape the influence and impact Neon Genesis Evangelion had on the anime world. Hotly debated yet receives just as much love as it does renouncing, if people are first entering the anime field, this is usually picked as a ""starter series"". While plot is sometimes confusing and characters speak in philosophy speeches at times, it's still a great although slightly overrated show but it's filled with enough memorable aspects that it at least deserves a viewing.

The year is 2015 and humanity's population has been cut in half. Thanks to an event known as ""Second Impact"", the climate has changed and people in New Tokyo-3 are living in a city built higher than the water levels. Appearing now and then are weird and massive creatures known as ""Angels"" where conventional weaponry is useless. However organization NERV has created the Evangelions, giant mech robots designed to fight them back. But things aren't as simple as the designated pilots; Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryru and Rei Ayanami, have to contend with their own personal issues as well as the real reason Second Impact happened and the potential for a Third.

Evangelion is one of those kind of shows where it does tend to stay with you, whether you liked the show or not. There's enough iconic imagery or scenes as well as characters that even 9 years after watching the initial run, I'm amazed at how much of it I remember. In fact, I even understand the show more having seen it a second time. Of course some things are fuzzy and the more philosophical dialogue characters go on sometimes goes over my head but not once do I feel like I'm being intentionally led around because people think confusion equals depth. At least here it's better written and more existential than the animated online comic ""Broken Saints"". Talk about pretentious.

Is there some issues with the show? Of course. There's a noticeable pattern in some episodes. Angel shows up when characters whine about whatever, angel does something completely surprising and characters do something completely out of left field to save the day. Having characters repeatedly say something is having no effect or no response over and over can get pretty old. Not to mention some characters don't really grow. Asuka is a controlling, egotistical ***** when she starts and she's pretty much the same when she ends as well as Shinji who is basically doing things because others tell him to but would rather just do nothing yet feel praise for doing something. As for episodes 25 and 26, there's been so much hatred for them that while I don't dismiss them since they're actually well-done, I can understand at how some might not like how the series decided to end.

My one gripe with this package is what's not included. The individual sets came with special features such as commentaries. While some might not completely mourn the loss of these, some might feel cheapened that you're not experiencing the completeness of the set, missing out on what others who buy the single editions get. So it all depends on economy and the amount of bonus features you want: lots of stuff included with the episodes or a relatively inexpensive box set compared to buying them separately.

While many other series might be more advanced animation-wise and had longer seasons, not many have had the impact Evangelion has and it's a series that at least everyone interested in anime should watch at least once.",1182124800,2,3471,4.866328257191201

2200930,4,B000767QTA,"(This review refers to the sub version, for my dub review look at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Perfect-Collection/dp/B0000639E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion - Perfect Collection</a>).
After seeing Eva for the first time about four months ago, I wrote a review and gave the series three stars, stating many reasons why it was and wasn't good (you can still read that review for the Perfect Collection). The review for the most part was quite neutral, but I received many comments asking me to give it another chance and watch in Japanese instead of in English. Eventually I caved, and now I'm glad I did. Although the series still suffers from some glaring flaws IMO, it is a whole lot better and easier watching it with the subtitles on than with the dubbing. The characters are presented much better and the acting is spot on. I didn't feel like strangling the main character every five seconds like I did with the dub and that in itself made the series better.

---THE GOOD---
The Characters in the sub are WAY better than their dub counterparts. In the dub I wanted to strangle the characters, or throw them off the cliff in annoyance and disdain. Shinji was just such a wimp I felt absolutely no sympathy for him and actually rooted on his demise (which never came). Misato was nothing but a slut, Auska a loud mouth brat, and Rei a pent up introvert.

Although the characters in the sub are, on the surface, more or less the same, the way they are presented is completely different. Shinji, although still a cowardly weakling, take a dramatic change after the first volume and starts to open up to the people around him for the majority of the show. from volume 2 on to volume 6, his character is somewhat likable in the way that he starts competing with the others and relates to them as a normal human being would. In volume one, he's completely unlikable, and then slowly changes into someone who the viewer can have an easier time relating to.
Rei is just the same in the dub and the sub alike. Her character is still a pent up introvert who refuses to open up. Really, she is one of the glaring flaws in this anime series. Her character never gets much attention at all, which is a shame because she could have been a very interesting character. She shows some signs of opening up in volume two, but after that all attempts at establishing her character are dropped. She exists in the background for the rest of the show, never doing or saying much of anything.

At the same time, upon second viewing, the mech battles aren't nearly as bad as I remember them being. Although there is still a problem with repetition, the problem isn't as annoying as it was when I first saw it. There was considerably less yelling in the sub version which made the otherwise cheesy battles quite tense. In the dub, everything seemed centered on the angel battles, but in the sub version, the angels are more of a back-story, a side show to the characters story.

Overall, almost nothing in the sub was quite as bad as it was in the dub version. The battles were better, the characters were better, and the overall mood of the series was better.

---The Bad---
At the same time, parts I remember as amazing were quite as good in the sub as they were in the dub. While watching the English version I remember volumes 6 and 7 being among the best episodes I've ever seen in anime, but when I watched them again, they didn't hold the same power they did when I first watched them. Auska's, Misato's, and Shinji's decent into depression all seemed to happen all at once. One episode everything's pretty much okay, the next everyone's thinking about suicide. I understand why everyone gets depressed, they all have their reasons and they are all understandable, but it didn't quite have the same power as it did in the dub. for other shows, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-and-Then-Here-and-There-Complete-Collector-s-Boxed-Set/dp/B000063K2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>, the drama was always better in Japanese, but here it seems that just for certain parts, the dub version holds more power.

Also, the ending, although a little better the second time around, is still a piece of garbage that should never have aired on TV. It seems the creator of this show though we couldn't figure out why the characters were depressed by ourselves so he created episode 25 to spell it out in minute detail and cover every single little thought they had. Was this really necessary? I already know why they all hate themselves; episode 25 is just throwing every ounce of subtlety away and spelling everything out for us in a really long and boring way. the music doesn't help out any, driving the viewer more towards sleep than interest, and the animation is, for the most part, just some character sitting in a dark room while his/her younger self talks to them in a monotone voice.

Episode 26 is a little better, but not by much. If you like hearing people talk to themselves, than maybe you'll like this, but otherwise this episode will have you falling asleep. The whole episode is just psycho babble, Shinji telling us (again) that he hates himself and everyone asking him why. At the very end we get a glimpse of an alternate world where the angels never showed up, and all the characters have very different personalities. This is near the end, and from that part up until the closing shot it's pretty decent. Overall, the ending is just too needlessly boring. its the kind of ""artistic"" ending that a college film student will make and his teacher will praise, but everyone else in the class will fall asleep while watching. it may be ""artsy"" but its boring and peointlesly complicated and doesn't finish the stoy in any way.

Other complaints and positives I had from my first review still stand, I just don't want to repeat myself again.

If you are thinking about watching this series, please for the love of god, watch it in Japanese. Do not ever bother with the English version, it sucks. If you read this review, please leave a comment.",1181433600,,6237,4.848826291079813
2200931,5,B000767QTA,"I figured I'd write up a quick summary of what the differences are amoung the FOUR platinum sets that are available to purchase. It took lots of research and surfing reviews and evangelion forums to distinguish the small differences. ALL these sets come with the directors cut, have been remastered and have 5.1 surround sound.

I'll begin with the platinum collection slim pack. Its a great buy for someone that has not seen the series or is begininng to start a collection and whats to save money/shelf space. But, you will get what you pay for. There are NO extra features i.e commentaries, background info etc. yes, the director cuts are included.

The second one is the evangelion: complete platinum collection. It's the same as the slim pack, only it does NOT contain individual slim cases. Instead its the bulky case that has all the dvd's inside one case. Honestly, you are better off with the slim pack. Atleast it has cool art design per case and the pricing is better.

The next two are arguable as to which is considered the top tier collector item. The argument stems from what I've read in forums, but up to the buyer to decide. In myopinion it's the individually built platinum collection set which i will describe below. I own it aswell, cost a pretty penny but worth it.

The third set is actually self built. Meaning you have to buy the the dvds individually. eva: platinum collection 1 comes with a collector art box which you can insert the rest of the dvds in. It comes packed with extra features, commentaries and the last dvd #7 contains a special feature entitled, ""mythology of evangelion"" couple guys give their take on what the eva story is about. just food for thought and interesting to think about. what makes this set unique are the silver slim cases that comes with each dvd and the 12 page booklets in each case that contains back stories on all the eva's/angels/characters/significant events and some cool still pictures.

the fourth set is the Evangelion Platinum: Perfect Collection which comes in a large tin/metal colletor case housing all the original individual platinum dvds i described up top. this set contains all the features but does not come with the informative booklet OR the slim silver box per dvd. since the case is large your dvds will slide around.

hope this helps you narrow down your choice on which set to purchase and i hope you really enjoy the series as much as i have.",1179187200,,2430,4.692488262910798

On I have one thing to say: Platinum Collection has all.

Sure you can say its missing a few ad ons (previews don't count) and maybe the booklets or some poster but for the price it hangs in and the fact that it brings not only the original 26 episodes but also the director's cut (known resurrection and genesis reborn releases, also they have the best possible sound quality and video quality when compared to every possible release makes it a must buy for those who don't have the series and wish to get it.

The only possible thing that you can be mad about is the fact that the dvd set doesn't bring the commonly knows ""true"" ending to evangelion: death and rebirth/the end of evangelion. Something that is easily solved by buying the movie at a bargain price.

2200935,4,B000767QTA,"Probably one of the biggest obstacles in storytelling is creating an utterly despicable character and making the audience still care about his plight.  Shinji is aguably the biggest weenie in the history of television, and yet I still cared about him.  It's part pshychological analysis(especially at the end) and part typical anime mecha(but done extrmeely well).  The angels are all innovative and unique, and there's a sense of real danger with them all, though they do folow the video gamish formula of growing successively more powerful.

The origins of the angels, and the political maneuvering, and the helpless characters manipulated by it, really steals the show.  The fourteen year olds really have no say in what happens, and are actually helping bring about humanity's demise while thinking they are saving it.

Misato and Asuka steal the show, and Gendo is stunning as the cold, heartless father of Shinji.

The animations isn't very good, and looks cheap even by TV anime standards, hence the four stars instead of five.

Just a warning, the last two episodes, though entertaining, don't give proper closure.  It's recommended to watch ""End of Evangelion"" to get a more thorough ending.",1174089600,,1200,5.144329896907217
2200946,5,B000767QTA,"*OVERVIEW and EPISODE REVIEWS:

Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE) starts out simple enough. A story about a boy named Shinji Ikari coming to a futuristic city and using giant robot-like Evas (Unit-01 himself) to fend off the invading enemies called Angels. Along the way he meets a mysterious girl and pilot of Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, the fiery pilot of Unit-02 Asuka Langley Soryu, Director of Nerv Operations Misato Katsuragi, the brilliant scientist, Ritsuko Akagi and his estranged father and Nerv's Commander, Gendo Ikari. There's also an intriguing cast of minor characters including friends from his school, Toji and Kensuke and Nerv's Vice Commander Fuyutsuki. But it ends in a completely different place than where it began, with so much filling its creamy center that it's hard to know what to cover in a review.

Yes, it indeed starts out simple enough: Through the first 8 episodes you probably couldn't distinguish NGE from any other giant robot anime ever made. These episodes, while entertaining, are as straight forward as anime gets. Then, slowly but surely from episodes 9-13, the characters are given to more detailing. We get to know them better as more of their stories and histories are revealed. A beautiful example of this is in episode 9 when Asuka falls down, asleep, next to Shinji, who is then tempted to kiss her before something makes him stop. The story is expanded upon as more secrets are revealed, which leads to more questions.

But then, during episode 14, which starts out as a boring ""recap"", half way through we get the first glimpse of what this series is really about. After the title card we hear the voice of Rei, giving a surreal and beautiful monologue with similar images following on the screen. This bit is practically visual/audio poetry working together, and gives the first hints of what's to come. The psychological and philosophical leanings of this episode would start to become more prominent throughout the series.

Episode 15 is really where the gears shift. The story has slowly built our interest in the characters and the many secrets up to this point, with as much humor and light heartedness as seriousness. In 15 though things takes a more mature, complex, and somber turn - with the end being the catalyst for the brilliant episodes to come. Indeed, episodes 16 and 18 are two of the most dramatic works of fiction I've ever experienced, with 17 being the calm interlude between them.

But then 19 comes along and trumps them all. If I could describe the chills I had when watching that episode for the first time... simply put, I don't think dramatic storytelling gets any better. Episode 20 is one of the deepest and complex, further diving into the psychology and symbolism behind the show. 21's back stories are woven so intricately you forget that you're watching an anime as the breadth given to the characters are incredible. 21's finale also serves as one of the most emotional in the series.

22 is one of the most disturbing episodes, diving into the psychology of Asuka this time in a way that will leave you feeling a bit shocked. 23 does what 22 did for Asuka and applies it to Rei. It also has the biggest, most stunning revelation in the series at the end of the episode, as one of Nerv's big secrets is revealed. These episodes also bring much of the ""bigger"" picture between Nerv, Seele, and the secrets behind the Angels and 2nd Impact into focus, which leads to the climax. That climax hits with episode 24, with the introduction of the last angel Kaworu. While one of the most perplexing episodes (due to its cryptic plot and dialogue), its magnificent finale - played out appropriately to Beethoven's final movement of his monumental 9th Symphony - serves as an outstanding closure to the main series before the final two episodes.

The final two episodes completely forego the story that's been building up, and focuses instead on the psychology and philosophy behind the show and its characters. These two episodes are brilliant in their own right. Episode 26 in particular, with its deconstructing of the meanings of reality and freedom, and examining of so many psychological hot points in the show (one's self worth, for instance) is an artistic high point in anime. They are not completely un-story related though, as the ""melding of minds"" in these episodes are a major plot element. But this works out great for the director Hideaki Anno who probably loved being able to get many of these feelings out through this series and these two episodes in particular.

For those wanting a closure to the story of NGE, ""The End of Evangelion"" is the grand finale to end all grand finales. While it won't answer everything in a nice, neat way (this is not a show that hands you answers on a silver platter), it provides an astonishingly powerful and poignant conclusion to the story and to the NGE series. I can understand the frustration of fans after watching the series and then the final two ""series"" episodes, thinking this was the end. In reality, the movie was MEANT to be the conclusion, but because of budget and time problems it couldn't be completed in time. The ""series"" finale will still stand on their own as the alternate take, but they're an essential alternate take as this is an anime whose meanings stretch far beyond the mecha-sci-fi, boy-saves-world genre. But the film sets a new standard in the art of closing a series on the perfect note.

*SERIES REVIEW

While the layers of psychology, philosophy, and symbolism would crush most shows under their own weight and seeming pretentiousness, Anno handles them with adeptness and acute direction. He skillfully weaves them into the story to the point where everything makes complete sense in relation to the characters and storyline. In fact, if you really take time to analyze the story, the characters, and the relationship between the dialogue and visuals with the psychological, philosophical, and symbolic meanings, you'll see this series does indeed have more depth than almost all others that have attempted to tackle similar subjects. In fact, this is a series which almost has to be viewed several times, as there are recurring motifs (both visually and in the dialogue) which link important thematic elements strung throughout. And if you're not watching carefully, you'll miss them the first and maybe even second time around.

I think the reason these ideas become so important is very simple, and that's because of the characters. Anno doesn't just create a random bunch of soulless, mindless, anime characters. He creates characters that everyone can relate to on some level. Because these characters have such range and depth, we begin to really care about them and their struggles. In the end their struggles become our own and they literally become mirrors of our own psychological profiles and problems. We begin to grieve as we watch them deal with such (self) destructive behavior caused by their circumstances and consequential frames of mind. It's because of this that the viewer actually cares about the more portentous moments, no matter how grandiose they become. I think it's very important for those out there to understand that all the elaborate complexities of NGE wouldn't matter without the characters that carry the weight and meaning of it all.

NGE is a show of extremes. Ranging from scenes of palpable, viseral power that inspire shock and awe, to the most quietly surene, surreal, and beautifully touching moments. These scenes are woven together as fine and eloquently as the Beethoven Symphony they play in episode 24 itself. And like that symphony, even though the parts are outstanding, the whole is much greater than the sum.

I believe this is a work of resounding artistic depth. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the absolute greatest pieces of fiction ever made in any medium. This may sound like hyperbole, but there have been few - if any - fictional works that have effected me both emotionally and psychologically like NGE has. If you put in the time and effort to actively watch this series, it will reward as many repeat viewings as you care to give it, as new layers and meanings will be uncovered each time. And I think that is, if nothing else, the first sign of a work of artistic genius.

*DVD REVIEW:

The Platinum Edition is far and away better than the Perfect Collection. The remastered visuals and audio are extraordinary. It doesn't get better than watching the big explosions in 5.1 Surround Sound! The remastered visuals are equally as striking. The reduced frame shake and jitter is a phenomenal improvement from the previous edition. It seems like they almost went back and re-animated parts of the show, making almost every scene look more vivid, life-like and alive. The Subtitled translations is another thing worth noting, as these translations are, by and large, more accurate. Even though I now hate the English translation of the song doesn't match the melody (always found it funny why it did on the Perfect Collection), this is a more accurate translation. The packaging is the only disappointment. The box is nothing special, the DVD cases themselves contain no booklets or notes, and there's no extras on the DVDs. But you get what you pay for as the price is a bargain. If you want all the other stuff you have to buy the Platinum Collection 1+Box and the rest of the collection separately.",1172361600,85,9418,4.873828856964397

Yes, but this series *definitely has that effect on people.* It's phenomenal, it's gorgeous, it's frightening--and most important of all it has a purpose behind it. (I've since watched the series through once more since then, along with the film End of Evangelion; the impact is has on me has not lessened with subsequent viewings)

I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Platinum Collection (a two week wait!? I may die from anxiety), but from what I understand the changes are worth the patience: additional scenes, commentary, Director's Cut episodes--most of what an Eva fan could wish for, based on how thought-provoking and confusing the series can be.

Hopefully Eva can transcend the stigma of anime being for kids or creepy fanboys/girls, because trust me: Eva is no Inuyasha, Sailor Moon--hell it's even no Cowboy Bebop. It's frightfully smart and intuitive, and if you give it enough thought, it can change you.",1170547200,2,1088,4.972527472527473
2200949,5,B000767QTA,"This is a review of the series and not any particular DVD release.

I would say Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the best anime series of all time, with an admirable attention to the human character's emotions, in a surreal plot that will keep you gripped all the way through.

The striking plot setup is that children have to be used to pilot war machines, and we see how these kid's lives are self destructing while they are surrounded by adults that are using them as tools of war. Everything is presented in a very ""real"" way, you feel the soundscapes and cultures of what's happening in any scene... you accept from the beginning that if it doesn't end in tragedy, there's much tragedy all along either way.

The are only two things that bothered me about this series. One, is what the Japanese call fan service. It basically means characters are caught naked in front of other characters and get embarrassed. It's hard to say if this is suppose to be titillating, a gag, or both, but it's something that happens in some anime, and this one it happens a LOT, like once or multiple times per episode. It almosts always detracts when it does, since the story is realistic and it's hard to buy people ending up in these situations. However, these sequences are always brief so you'll get over it and learn to ignore it if it bothers you.

The other thing is something that has been a lightning rod of fan criticism of the series, the ""ending"" of it as far as the episode run is concerned is a 100% cop out. It turns into basically an informal philosophy lecture, using the character's voices and mostly still shots. There's almost NOTHING related to the extremely detailed and realistic plots tied up here, other then a few vague references to what's happening that you have no reason to trust. It's basically an ending that takes place in the twilight zone, and you will be very agitated to experience such a rich story to end with all the richness ignored, and no resolutions. You have to watch a separate movie to see what you would expect of the series conclusion.

I'd also recommend buying the movie ""The End of Evangelion"" to compliment the set- The two-pak is a fine deal, but in all honesty, ""Death and rebirth"" is a somewhat unnecessary synopsis of the series, and the second half of the movie is the first half of ""End of Evangelion."" I'd only purchase this if you were a die-hard fan that wants to see everything the series begat.

2200952,5,B000767QTA,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is a re-release of the original series in an economy thin-pack box set. It is the original episodes, plus the last four having an additional showing as Director's Cuts, meaning a bit longer in the tooth.

The story takes place in the future of planet Earth, years after a catashtrophic attack by aliens has melted the polar ice caps, flooding a large majority of the world. Society has been in upheaval and is now regaining stability.

Enter Shinji, the son of the man running the organization known as Nerv, and responsible for the Mech units known as ""Evangelion"". The Evangelion's, or ""Eva's"" for short, are Earths only line of defence against a new wave of alien attacks. Shinji, along with German Asuka, and Silent but Steady Rei, are the only ones who can pilot these war beasts. Not to mention, they also go to school, given that they are only fourteen years old.

This is not an anime for those looking for a quick fix of comedy or panty-shots. While their certainly are some comedic moments, this is primarily a serious anime, and those willing to really watch the series will be rewarded in the end.

As far as special features go, there isn't much, their is commentary on the directors cut episodes, and the picture quality is much improved over the original, and it has 5.1 sound quality. Not much else.

However, the value of this box set more than makes up for a lack of special features.

Bottom line, if you desire mecha fighting, a deep and twisted plot, excellent character development, and of course, aliens, than this is the series for you.

Another slightly noticable difference was the Director's Cut versions of eps 21-24, although I only noticed an extra scene here and there.",1162512000,2,562,4.3428571428571425
2200957,5,B000767QTA,"Neon Genesis Evangelion or EVA is a series about three teenaged pilots working for the classified military agency with the duty of protecting humanity from destruction by a mysterious and powerful enemy. Now where I have heard this before oh yes in the two thousand other series with them same plot line, trust me this plot outside of the rough draft is anything but common.  What makes EVA different from the rest, it's actually good and different. Though with a somewhat save humanity from extinction at the hand of supposed aliens EVA uses Christian mythology to weave an actually interesting and fascinating plot out of something quiet mundane. Know you wondering why I'm going on and on about the plot, well EVA more then any thing is a plot driven series, a plot that will keep you guessing.

Now then I've only seen the platinum edition which has been full remastered making the entire thing look and feel almost completely new. The art work after the remaster looks like it just got rolled off the press and looks really good. The voice acting is excellently done, some of the best I've heard. The music is first rate and as expected some of the best out there. The plot is interesting and twisting leaving wondering what is going to happen next.

Now then for the flaws, yes I'm going to point out all of the flaws of one of the most beloved series of all time, that most people consider to be flawless. No I do not expect to live long.

The biggest problem EVA suffers from is the near complete lack of character development. Aside from learning each character's past they never really change. This is especially irritating with Shinji, the main character. He's the same winy brat at the end of the series he was at the begining. If you're looking for character relationships, development and growth and the like EVA WILL let you down. The Series is about plot not characters. The second biggest problem is that everything and I mean everything has a double meaning for the plot and also a philosophical meaning. Which you most likely won't realize until the second to last episode. Third is that it almost requires you to have at least a passing knowledge of Christian and Hindu mythology and symbolism or you'll just find yourself lost and hating the series `cause you don't get it. This is not a series for the timid, the easily offended or the immature. There is gore, the most grotesque gore I have ever seen, some scenes to the point it will make you feel sick. There is plenty of fan fair and naughty jokes and nudity. Pretty much everything that would make a catholic priest condemn you for watching. What else is wrong with the series. The fact that until you have watched the entire series and the two movies twice you won't really know what the hell is going on. But most defiantly is the ending it leave you hanging in the air. The last two episodes is nothing more then the director ranting about philosophy and has little if anything to do with the series's story line. You can skip them or if you're like me who loves philosophy will watch them over and over again. Even with all these flaws the series is still perfect mix just not when you break it down into bits.
Let's review the review, plot is above average, characters are above average, character development is nil, mech fights are interesting if some times boring, art work is dated, music is excellent, is one of the darkest and complex series out there, will give granny a heart attack and last the philosophy is the best you will ever find anywhere. In short if you are not easily offended, have an open mind, like series that require your absolute attention every second and like an interesting thought provoking stuff dark story. Then this is right up your alley. All this aside it is nearly impossible for me to too highly recommend buying this series especially this edition.",1159574400,2,3867,4.616279069767442

The way he turns his visions into cinema is unmatched by anyone else. And to think I used to dispise this show on Adult Swim.

As far as those who have never seen Evangelion, you are missing out on the best of the best.  Many fans consider Cowboby Bebop, Evangelion, and Trigun the best animes ever made...  While Trigun may be more deserving of a top 10 recommendation than a top 3, Cowboby Bebop and Evangelion easily compete for the top spot.

One last point...  For those who have never seen Evangelion, keep this simple idea in mind when watching it: the series is not primarily about giant monsters fighting giant robot looking things.  If you remember this as you watch it, I think you will appreciate the ending of the series, which has little to do with the action sequences during the various episodes.

of the anime is presented in the ""EPISODES"" and it is done incredibly well there'in...No one buys a box set to have the extras!!!(cough)IMO i see communtaries as ""SPOILERS"" they take away the ""FUN"" out of figuring things out by ourselfs, and they never tell us what we what to hear...(sigh)

OK im done with ""WHINNING"" about the ""WHINNERS""

Well i must admit that i disliked this series at first..My friend tryed to get me to watch it with him at my house..And i thought ohhhh!!! another ""GUNDAM"" type anime, I was ""WRONG""...I would make fun of him for watching it...Boy did i feel like a jerk after he left his perfect collection at my house....They sat there for a couple days on my shelf collecting dust, But then i got bored and decided to watch a couple episodes. After i watched EPs 1-8 i became hooked to it..So i apologized and we watch the remaining episodes, and rented the ending movie EOE (this was 5 years ago) even after all this time, This is still the ""BEST"" anime ever!!!IMO The complexity of this series is its biggest strong-point. i love how the story unfolds just enough to keep u interested, and how the pilots are spirtually tied to there Evas, you cant help but become emotionally tied to the characters and there evas....who cares if shinji ""WHINES"" alot, we would too if we were in his situation...This series is a ""MIND GRIPPING"" ""EMOTIONAL"" ""HEART-POUNDING"" rollercoaster ride i will never forget!!!!! And the picture and sound transfer is the best i have seen..the packaging for this set is really well put together, the artwork on the box is vibrant and drawn out accurately,and is overall a better box then the bulky perfect collection box. i recommend this for peaple who want the ""ULTIMATE"" boxset to the ""ULTIMATE"" anime

Not only do you get all 26 episodes marvelously transferred, but there is an additional disc containing ""director's cuts"" of four of the concluding episodes. The audio is also of equal quality, which was re-recorded for this renewal release in Dolby 5.1 (for both English and Japanese audio tracks.) If your prefer to go with the Japanese audio, than you should find the English subtitles to be decent. I did catch one or two errors, but it wasn't detrimental to the overall viewing experience. There is very little in the extras department, just a small selection of ADV trailers, but if you don't care about such things its not an issue (get the 120 dollar set if you want it all.) But the price is very reasonable for so much quality content, and I would say you'd get more for your money with this set. The series itself is quite good; containing an interesting plot, great (relatable) characters a good amount of great action scenes. The animation style is also very clean, with a good amount of attention to detail (but not without occasional mistake). It's about the most mainstream Anime series out there, but there is a reason for that.

Oh, and if you end up enjoying the series, do your self a favor and grab ""End of Evangelion"", which makes episodes 25 and 26 work, in my opinion.",1152489600,3,1376,4.57085020242915

The basic delivery service of Amazon.com is Extremely good. When I ordered it, it was shipped within 48 hours, and arrived two days after that, well ahead of the projected arrival date.

2200971,2,B000767QTA,"Now before you go directly to the ""Was this review helpful to you?"" section and click ""no"" solely based on the title of this review, I hope that you read it first.

When I first started watching the series, I was intrigued. It had good characters with a range of emotions and depth that could help you feel for the characters. But as the show went on, it became convoluted and pretentious. Now I don't mind shows that make you think, in fact, I'm all for cerebral entertainment. The show took depth to far and made a black hole. Depth is good, black holes anywhere near me,bad. The use of evangelical symbols and names was a genius move(or rediculous move in this case) on the part of the creator. The relationship between characters and symbolic meanings makes for a more interesting show. Unfortunately, there was barely any relationships to be had. I have read that during an interview, the creator was asked about all the religious symbols, in which he answered that he threw them in because it was ""cool""(if you need clarification, search the hundreds of anime and NGE forums).
I have read countless threads on countless Anime forums where people try to decipher and make sense of NGE. Most of the time, these individuals go so far over the edge to convince others(and themselves) that so and so meant this or that.

As far as characters go, Shinji was the most annoying. I went from feeling sorry for him to hoping he would sustain a fatal wound. How much whining and crying do I have to listen to before he commits to any action.
The ""lets all watch what we've seen already"" episodes dulled the series down even more for me. It is the one thing I dislike the most about many a anime.
Lets not leave out the last episodes. I'm sorry, were the artists and writer on some sort of hallucinogen. Episode 25 and 26 certainly provided closure for me in the sense that I ended up not caring about what happened to the characters. Now I know why the movies were made(which I have not and will not see).

This anime is over-analyzed and overhyped. For me, reading all the hype and interpretations before hand made the viewing all the more difficult.

So why give this two stars after my tirade above. Unlike many animes I have viewed, NGE did a great job at hooking me at the beginning(not much could be said as the series went on). Secondly, I have seen anime much worse(although not as hyped).
And finally, I gear a lot of my ""anger"" towards the people who made NGE what it is today. If it wasn't for all the hype surrounding NGE, it might have made for a semi-decent anime.

As for what you get for the price, It's about right on par. Not much in the way of extras. The animation is very crisp and the packaging is to my liking. I have never been a stickler for packaging or extras unless the price of the DVD(s) should reflect it. Considering what it cost a couple of years ago, this is a great deal.",1150761600,31,2901,4.425093632958801
2200972,5,B000767QTA,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is my favorite anime series. I had heard of the series before, and I started watching it in August or september when it started airing on TV. I watched the series up until episode 17 and I just had to buy it. I was able to find it at Best Buy, where I bought it for around 60 dollars. It was worth every penny!

  Since I bought it, I have watched the series 5 or 6 times, and I always manage to find something new in one of the 26 epsisodes.

  Now to the reviewing. There are 6 discs, each about 125 minutes, and there are about 5 episodes per disc except for disc 5 which contains 6 episodes and is 150 minutes and disc 6 which contains the directors cut versions (added scenes) of episodes 20-24, and it runs about 120 minutes. The entire box set contains 650 minutes of episodes. Being the platinum box set, the sound quality has been improved and and the images are much clearer (if you have seen it on tv, you will be pleasantly suprised at the greatly improved quality). Also, the opening credits plays a very slightly slower paced version of the opening song (A cruel angel's thesis), and at the end of every episode, it plays a different version of ""fly me to the moon"" (the closing song). There aren't commentaries on any of the episodes.

  Neon Genesis Evangelion is a great anime series. It takes place in the year 2015, where the world has been greatly changed due to an event known as second impact (that took place in the year 2000) that melted the antartic, causing a lot of land to go underwater due to the severe flooding, starting many wars over territory, making the earth lose about half of its population. As if that isn't enough, creatures known as angels are attacking mankind for unknown purposes and humans have to use giant robots known as evangelions to combat them. The series centers around the pilots of these evangelions.

  But if you think that the series is all about giant robot fighting, you are mistaken. There is much, much more to the series than fighting robots, so much that you'd have to watch the series to find out it all.

  Pay very close attention when watching this series, because there is so much going on if you don't pay attention you may be lost. There are so many great things about this series that you'll only know if you watch it.

  The seires starts out slow, and it brings up many, many questions for the viewer, questions that aren't answered until the end of the series and even the movies (that both take place and should be watched, after the series). The series really picks up around episode 16 and the rest of the series and movies are extrordinary.

  One complaint that I find a lot of people have, is the whininess of some of the main characters (particularly shinji). Well, a key part of enjoying the series is to try to identify with (or if you can't do that just ignore) shinji.

  I found watching this series very enjoyable and rewarding, I highly recommend it. (not for kids, some nudity, some sexual content, a little bad language, and lots of blood)",1150588800,3,3054,4.451438848920863

As soon as I saw the price I could not resist, especially considering this is one of the best anime ever made. Not only do you get the original 26 episodes but the four director's cut episodes as well. This is without a doubt the best Evangelion collection out there.

  The original ending of Evangelion may not appeal to everyone.
Personally, I think the End of Evangelion movie provides more understanding of the series and a better sense of closure.",1145404800,,547,4.677083333333333
2200974,5,B000767QTA,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is without a doubt, a masterpiece and a true classic! With a cast of unforgetable characters, a riveting storyline, and a wonderful soundtrack, Evangelion has truly won the hearts of otakus all over the world. Probably one of Studio Gainax's finest works! When I found this lying on store shelves, it was the only one they had left. So after a few minutes of long thinking, I just straight up bought the thing. Because not only have I only seen two episodes of it back in my day, but just gotta have it. Boy, was it worth my money! Now I can honestly say that my anime DVD collection is perfect. You know what they say...don't get caught without the classics. In other words, you gotta have Evangelion in the collection!

PICTURE (10/10)

ADV wasn't just putting the ""Platinum"" name on this boxset for nothing after all. The picture quality of this set is nothing short of amazing. No pixelations, blurry textures, no nothing. It ain't VHS quality like the first Evangelion boxset. The transfer is just perfect! You can't get any better than this!

SOUND QUALITY (10/10)

Beautiful! Just plain beautiful! Evangelion has never sounded better. Play this on your surround sound system and you'll know what I mean. Say goodbye to VHS quality sound. This is where it's at! Platinum indeed!

ENGLISH DUBBING (4/10)

I guess during the early years of dubbing, the actors sounded awful than the ones we hear today. The english dub for Evangelion is no different. It was just straight up garbage! I noticed a lot of the english voice-overs try to sound identical to their Japanese counterparts.

For instance, maybe it's just me or Allison Keith, the english voice for Misato, at certain times, would try to emulate the tone of the original seiyuu, Kotono Mitsuishi. And I can't help but notice that Brett Weaver tried to emulate Tomokazu Seki's voice, when he was voicing Toji. Well like I said, maybe it's just me. Even today, some english voice-overs for anime are known for trying to sound like their Japanese counterparts. Or rather they try TOO hard, period. Sure, we all know that Asuka is German, and it would be unfair for me to say that the actress can't have her speak German. But sometimes, it would come to a point where it's not even necessary.

And one other thing, (slight spoiler) when she did the language recognition inside Unit 02, Shinji was thinking in Japanese and it detected it. What they should've done in the English version, was have them speak one phrase in Japanese after Asuka ""switched the base language to Japanese"". Instead they spoke in english, and Unit 02 was activated. Instead of saying ""Evangelion Unit 2, go!"", they should've went with ""Evangelion ni-go ki, kido!"" or something like that. Or what they could've done in that scene was say ""switch the base language to English"", then that would make sense.

So believe me when I say this...you're better off watching this with the original Japanese language with english subtitles. Alright, maybe by now you'll be complaining that you don't understand the langauge, and you don't wanna read subtitles. But seriously, what's better? Torturing your ears with bad voice acting, on the cost of ""listening to it in your own language"", or enjoying and appreciating the original Japanese voices with the subtitles for you to understand what's going on?

As you know, sometimes when anime is translated into english, omit the bad voices, it's possible that the story will be ruined or worse, butchered. But I guess the people who translated Evangelion in english, weren't that stupid. They stuck with the original story and at times, their acting can be somewhat okay...I'll give them that much.

But still, save your ears! Well, that sounded harsh, but how else am I gonna break it down? Watch it in Japanese with english subs, and learn to appreciate Evangelion in its original form, the way it was meant to be watched.

EXTRAS (5/10)

Not much here! Unless you're talking about the directors cut episodes on the sixth disc and trailers of different anime released by ADV, then I guess those are the sought out special features you'd want to see. They should've at least put features like an encyclopedia on the main Evangelion units, character profiles, actor and director interviews, behind the scenes look, bloopers, and documentaries. If this set had any of those, then it would truly be a 100% platinum set. But I'm not gonna take a star down just because of that. Simply because I love the series and the transfer is so fantastic, I guess that simply makes up for the lack of extras. With a series this great, who needs them?

OVERALL (10/10)

Is it worth the money? My answer is yes! And at this price? Definetly! If you haven't seen this series even once, then you're missing out on one of anime's most treasured classics. It's one of those series where it'll keep you guessing until the very end. Your collection is incomplete without Evangelion, believe it or not! This series is without a doubt, a masterpiece in every sense of the word. If you ever happen to run into this, and it's the only one in stock, get it immediately! Sure I paid a huge amount of money for this sucker, but like I said, it's worth it! And I have no regrets. It's better than paying over $100 for a boxset.

This new Platinum Collection of Neon Genesis Evangelion is a far more pratical solution to both buying the original box set, or buying each DVD separately. It's perfect for long-time fans of the show, or newbies who are worried about putting a lot of money down. (You're already saving well over $100 with this set.) And as someone who has limited shelf space, this thinpack takes up much less room.

While a little short on some of the special features you'd expect from such a big name title, you're still getting your money's worth. Besides the series in full, there is also an extra disc with director's cut episodes. While Death and Rebirth and The End  of Evangelion are not included, this isn't much of a problem.

The only warnings I would give would be to those who are new to the series. It's a popular anime, but there's a lot of violence, blood, religious themes, angst, dark themes; definately not for the faint of heart. However, there are also a lot of deep themes that the show touches on. Shinji Ikari, one of the main characters, isn't the most popular anime character of all times, but I found I could really identify with him.

2200981,4,B000767QTA,"Considering the price of this slimpak is only slightly more than the cost of two of the Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Edition releases, I think it's crazy for anime and mecha fans to not buy this. First of all, it's Neon Genesis Evangelion, a modern masterpiece through and through. (...)With digitally cleaned up video and a kick-butt Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track (sorry, I don't much care for dubbed anime), this is the best presentation of Neon Genesis Evangelion ever. PLUS - we get the director's cuts of episodes 21-24!

Personally, I don't think it is a major factor to lose the audio commentaries and brief featurettes that were part and parcel of the initial Platinum Edition release, especially since this slimpak release has such an affordable price tag.",1140825600,,779,4.992307692307692

The colors are nicer, lines smoother, and all of the screen shakes and blotches from the original version have been removed. In addition, this set includes the Director's Cut volume, which contains three episodes that have entirely new scenes added onto them, scenes which are vital for die-hard Evangelion fans.

2200986,5,B000767QTA,"When I first saw this show on Adult Swim, I thought it was good, but not amazing. After about 13 episodes, I found that I was absolutely hooked.  This show has some of the most amazing character development I have ever seen, and doesn't lack the action factor either. After a couple weeks from seeing the 13th episode, I decided to buy the box set. I have read some complaints on how there are so few extras (only trailers on the first disc) in this box, but aren't the episodes what you really want to see anyway?  In this box are 5 DVD discs containing 26 episodes, and a sixth containing 4 directors cut episodes, that show a new depth to some of the characters. Keep in mind though, this show isn't for the faint of heart. There is at least 1 one to five sexual references in each episode (none of them are very explicit), some kissing scenes, that reveal relationships certain characters have with each other, and one off screen sex scene (which is where all sex scenes need to be). The language is not particularly strong. I haven't stumbled across any F-words, only a couple of S-words at most. The violence is one of the strongest factors here. Although the angel fights are all moderately violent, there is one absolutely brutal massacre made on an angel, that left me a little breathless. By far however, this show is more disturbing than anything else. The plot material may need to be seen by a mature audience to fully understand, because of how disturbing it can be.  Still, with all of these things, the show is quite amazing. The animation is fantastic, the voice actors (English) do a great job at grasping their characters.

2200989,5,B000767QTA,"While I do not want to talk to in depth about the plot because I know I would start to describe seens to in depth, I will just say that this is an amazing and thought provoking series.

The story follows the path of three pubecent teens who have undergone tremendous stress in their lives, suffering from abandonment anxieties, self hate, mental instability, amongst countless other issues.  Sadly these children are the only people capable of piloting giant robots known as evangelions.  The reason for these mecha is an enemy called the angels, giant creatures with varying powers and appearance, that exist to enact the biblical apocolypse.  The story line follows these basic plot keys, but is much deeper and philisophical.

For the most part the ideas in the show are easy enough to follow, but the last two episodes require some deeper thought and a mind that is used to thinking philisophically.  A lot of people would say that episodes 25-26 (the last two) are terrible and that you should just watch the movie ""End Of Evangelion"" instead, but those final episodes are probably my favorite ones next to #22.

This set in particular doesn't really contain anything in the way of extra features, except for four directors cut version episodes (21-24) which are amazing.  I would also suggest some parental discretion maybe, there is partial nudity and some adult themes, but really if you plan on enjoying this anime your probably old enough for that stuff anyway.

Well I'm gonna go watch some more of this show obsesively so buy the DVD's and fall in love with this deep anime.

P.S.  Buy End Of Evangelion it rules just as much as the show  ROCK ON!!!

I am adding this section at the bottom because I have recently read some of the other reviews for this series and would like to address and explain what many people call ""weak points.""  The most common one was how unlikeable the characters are, but it is because the characters are so unlikeable that you love them so much you want to help them and when they never get better you realise that not everyone can be saved.  Another common complaint is that the creator was having severe mental problems during production, and he came up with ideas on the fly, but great authors such as Edgar Allan Poe suffered severe mental stress, and Lord of the Rings were just bed time stories Tolkien made up for his kids then wrote down later.

It sucks soo bad becuase you are soo confused,it like doesnt end it,i was all like WTF i need the ending not a freggin thing on shenji and his mind,but like every one is saying,it was because of like the director of this show had to make the ending really really fast becuase it was gonna air or something really soon,ah something like that.but anyway so he had to make an ending real fast so then of course the turtle wins the race and everyone thought it sucked and stuff so he made a better version,wooot:)lol.

It is wonderfully drawn and animated. The writing and voice acting is amazing. The set is a great value and and I would have liked to give it a 4 and a half. The only thing that would keep this set from getting a 5 star rating is that you don't get the booklets and goodies that accompanied the original platinum dvds.

The only valuable extras in the original edition were the booklets, and if you search carefully the net you might find a way to compensate this loss...

As for the episodes, I did not detect any change in pace (I watched eps 21-24 in DC version), nor in image quality (compared to the first volume I already have), so I would say that this thinpack (which is very sturdy) is the only reasonable choice for the new fans.

I looked for 5 hours straight and just realized nothing could compare (yes I already know about Fullmetal Alchemist), until I remembered that ""weird mech show"" I had seen a few times on adult swim. I looked it up and bought it and was not dissapointed. It truly has a thought provoking storyline, great EVA vs. ANGEL battles, some humour (hooray for Pen Pen!), and besides it's length (once again I'm an IY fan so I'm not used to 20-something episode animes) is probably my third favorite anime now (1. Inuyashsa 2. Fullmetal Alchemist). I thought the packaging was very nice with Rei and Asuka on the cover of a nice solid cardboard case, and the thinpaks are well-protected. While this anime DOES contain some pretty graphic  violence, some sexual themes (is that what you call them?), and more swearing than I expected, I find no reason why younger audiences shouldn't enjoy the story. If it makes you feel better watch it with your kids and yell ""BEEP!"" every time they're gonna swear. whatever floats your boat, I personally hate censorship of any kind but that's not the point. note: the subtitles sometimes don't work on Xboxes or Computers (I find 3/10 work on xbox and 8/10 pc). They work fine on regular DVD players but I don't know about PS2 or Xbox 360. Another note, the opening song is incorrectly subtitled. ADV films took so many liberties altering it so it would follow the beat of the song that they changed it altogether. These are the real lyrics obtained from [...]

Like a cruel angel,

young boy, become the legend!  [2]

[Short Instrumental Intro]

A blue wind is now

knocking at the door to your heart, and yet

you are merely gazing at me

and smiling.

Something gently touching--

you're so intent on seeking it out,

that you can't even see your fate yet,

with such innocent eyes.

But someday I think you'll find out

that what's on your back

are wings that are for

heading for the far-off future.

The cruel angel's thesis

will soon take flight through the window,

with surging, hot pathos, [3]

if you betray your memories.

Embracing this sky [universe] and shining, [4]

young boy, become the legend!

[Instrumental]  [5]

Sleeping for a long time

in the cradle of my love

The morning is coming when you alone will be called

by a messenger of dreams.

Moonlight reflects off

the nape of your slender neck.

Stopping time all throughout the world

I want to confine them, but...

So if two people being brought together by fate

has any meaning, [6]

I think that it is a ""bible""

for learning freedom. [7]

The cruel angel's thesis.

The sorrow then begins.

You held tight to the form of life

when you woke up from that dream.

You shine brighter than anyone else.

Young boy, become the legend!

People create history

while weaving love.

Even knowing I'll never be a goddess or anything like that,

I live on.

The cruel angel's thesis

will soon take flight through the window,

with surging, hot pathos,

if you betray your memories.

Embracing this sky and shining,

young boy, become the legend!

Translator's Notes:

[1] ""TE-ZE"" is the Japanese spelling/pronunciation of ""these,"" which is German for ""thesis.""

[2] The word ""shinwa"" actually means ""myth"" (""legend"" would be ""densetsu""), but I think it sounds better as ""legend.""

[3] ""Atsui"" (hot) can also mean ""intense, passionate.""  ""Pathos"" is ""the quality or power in life or art of evoking a feeling of pity or compassion; pity; suffering; sorrow.""

[4] ""Sora"" (sky) is the reading given for the kanji for ""uchuu"" (universe).

[5] In some versions of this song, there is singing in this part. Unfortunately, I can't tell what they're singing (there's too much overlap).  I think the last thing they sing could be ""ai ga fusei,"" which can be roughly translated into ""Love is a sin (wrongdoing).""  If you have any idea what they're singing, please e-mail me.  Arigatou!

[6] The kanji used for the ""a"" in ""aeta"" is not the normal kanji used in ""au"" (to meet).  It's the first kanji in ""ouse"" (encounter, tryst) and has more of a connotation of meeting by fate or being brought together by fate, not just meeting.  (Interestingly, a dictionary I have gives the meaning of ""au,"" when written with this kanji, as ""to meet (with drama or pathos)"")

[7] The ""watashi wa sou"" is probably ""watashi wa sou omou.""  And ""bible"" in this case isn't referring to *the* Bible.  ""Bible"" can also mean ""guide book, how-to book, a book valued for its use as a reference,"" like in ""a handyman's bible,"" or ""a bird-watcher's bible.""

NOTE: Yes, this translation is different from the one presented on the Evangelion videos & DVDs produced by ADV. There's a reason for that: mine is more literal and correct. When ADV ""translated"" this song, they decided to change the words so that the English ""translation"" could be sung to the beat of the original song (this is commonly called dubtitling). But in the process of changing the ""translation"" to fit the beat of the song, they had to take rather big liberties with it, until their ""translation"" was no longer correct. The essence of the meaning remains, but it is largely incorrect. I, on the other hand, did a true translation, not a ""dubtitle,"" so my translation on this page is, indeed, more literal and correct than ADV's translation that they put on their Eva tapes and DVDs.

This is not my translation and was obtained from [...]

2201001,5,B000767QTA,"My Evangelion background:
 I have been a fan of the series since I rented the weird ""End of Evangelion"" movie a couple of years ago.  I rented the original DVDs (the 'Perfect' collection) from Netflix and watched every episode in Japanese+Subtitles and English.  I have also seen ""Death & Rebirth.""

What THIS collection contains (hardware):
 I purchased this collection from Amazon.  The disks have an interesting textured label application.  Nothing else is special about the physical items.  Thin DVD containers, decent box, NO inserts AT ALL unless you include the promo page stuck to the back of the box.

What THIS collection contains (software):
 Just the episodes and the director's cut versions of four episodes, nothing extra.  No commentaries, no interviews, no guides, nothing.  Well, it has some previews, but those do not count.  To be clear, the director's cut and original versions of the four episodes are both here.

Detailed review:
 I watched the first DVD and was amazed at the quality of the transfer.  It had been a few months since I had seen the Netflix version, so I re-rented the first DVD to compare.
 Yes, the picture quality is vastly superior to the old version.  I never really noticed the frame shake before, but watching the original was like watching a crappy 60's western--almost every transition was marred by at least two or three frame shakes that cannot be ignored once the 'clean' one is seen.  The images themselves are also much cleaner.  The old version looks like a VCR tape by comparison.
 The sound was also amazing.  I prefer watching in orignal Japanese with English subtitles, so it was a great surprise to hear it in Dolby Digital 5.1--usually the Japanese soundtrack is only two-channel.
 There are a few additions to the episodes, but usually very small adds.  However, the four director's cut episodes have significant additions that explain things that would otherwise be confusing, which is good, because episode 21 is where the series really takes the story in a new direction.

Opinion:
 Again, I watch the Japanese w/ subtitles.  I was switching audio sources to compare English & Japanese and they sounded exactly the same except for the vocals.  It also reminded me why I watch the Japanese versions--in one scene, Toji gave Ryoko a small item.  The English actor said ""I guess the cat's out of the bag"" but the subtitles showed ""Here is a cat souvenir for you"" (not exact quotes).  The English one makes it sound like he's giving her a secret clue to the rest of the story instead of just giving her a cat coin (she collects cat stuff).  Plus, you get to see how many ways the sound for ""yes"" is used (""yes sir, yes, yeah, probably"" are all the same word, just different levels of inflection).

Should you buy it?
 Here's how you should do it:
 1) Rent ""End of Evangelion"".  You will either love it or hate it, but it provides an alternate ending to the series.  Personally, I love it, but I also appreciate the original ending.  If this movie makes you want to find out what's going on, then you will enjoy the series.  If you thought the movie was stupid and you didn't care about the characters then you will not like the series, so you just saved yourself the cost of the .
 2) Buy this collection.  You WILL watch it again, so you will enjoy the excellent transfer quality for a bargain price.

Note:  I revised this review to strip out renting Perfect collection first.  There really is no reason to do this since Wikipedia has more info than the extras.  Check out these sites for detailed NGE info:

2201002,5,B000767QTA,"This is arguably the best anime series ever created. Its themes have resonated with fans of the genre for a decade. At first glance merely a ""Giant Fighting Robots"" anime, it evolves quickly into something much more. What that is depends on personal interpretations, but that is irrevevant. It is, simply, unbelievable.

The entire series has previously been released in various forms. The original 8 DVDs were compiled into the ""Perfect Collection"" a few years ago, priced at about $150. The set is gorgeous, but shortly after its release ""Director's Cut"" editions of several episodes were released. Shortly after those releases, ""Platinum Editions"" were released, with remastered sound and enhanced audio.

This new ""Platinum Collection"" contains those most recent, Platinum versions of the series. The set is comprised of 6 ""Thinpack"" DVDs - which are held in a very sturdy, high-quality cardboard case - taking up roughly the space of three normal-sized DVDs. The first five discs contain all 26 original episodes of the series on very attractive, simple silver discs. The 6th disc contains the Director's Cut versions of episodes 21-24. There are no special features on this set.

Yes, this is a seemingly shameful double-dip of the series, but it is, like the series itself, simply the best there is to offer as far as Anime box sets go. It is simple, attractively designed, and most importantly inexpensive. It is certainly not recommendable to buy this if you already own the Perfect Collection, but otherwise this is the set to buy. The only flaw is the absence of the two films - ""The End of Evangelion,"" an alternative to the disappointing final two episodes of the series, and the vastly inferior ""Death & Rebirth."" While hard-core fans will be disappointed by the lack of special features, which were undeniably sub-par in the Perfect Collection anyway, most will likely prefer this set, both for its atractive packaging and incredbily reasonable pricetag.",1135468800,,1969,5.108695652173913

2201004,2,B000767QTA,"Certainly this is cheap. Indeed you will save your money bigtime and you will have all 26 episodes. However, the quality of these episodes is very different from the episodes that ADV originally released, and not for the better. Pay no more attention to the advertising gimmick of the remastered video and jaw dropping 5.1 surround sound, because this is the first way that the series has been ruined in this format. All that has been changed is the sound effects are louder and at times the voices echo. On top of that, the 4 director's cut episodes have been redubbed, with a few characters voiced by completely different actors.

  The other problem with this item is that the pacing of nearly every episode has been changed. Where there were pauses in the older versions between dialogue, now there are none. The characters sound like they have been drinking too much coffee. Even though Ritsuko is bummed out in Episode 24, she is babbling like a baboon.  I suppose in order to fit 6 episodes on one disk, this must be done.

  Finally, there are no extras, none. The perfect collection which runs at about $130 contains character descriptions, Spanish and French language tracks, plenty more artwork on the covers and protect the discs much better than the flimsy, thin covers on these DVD's. I think quality rates a little higher than the low quantity for which this item runs. This great series has been raped.",1134691200,18,1418,4.739837398373984
2201005,1,B000767QTA,"Such a fine series but utterly destroyed by ADV's double-dipping scam. If they could have fit 6 episodes on 1 DVD and sold the entire set for $50, why didn't they do it in the first place? ADV did the same with some other fine series, including Robotech, Noir, and Rahxephon. And still ADV continues to rip off anime fans by tactics such as these. It's about time anime fans stood up and said NEVER AGAIN to such deplorable tactics. If you don't have this series, this is a great and cheap way to start. You'll be deprived of the beautiful DVD booklets, though, that offer information and insight into the mythology of the series. You'll also be contributing to the perpetuation of this absolutely despicable tactic that will rip off more anime fans in the future. If you have the original Platinum Collection, one of the extra documentaries features a GRINNING Matt Greenfield saying that this release of Evangelion will not be the last one, that they will continue to reissue this series over and over again. Make up your own mind.",1134604800,9,1033,4.6502732240437155
2201006,3,B000767QTA,"The only actual extras, per say, is that disc 6 has the 4, ""Director's Cut"" episodes, which is nice to have, but that's it.

After stupidly purchasing and hastily opening this box set, to check out the shape of the discs (as I tend to find at least one scratched disc, or broken disc tray/case, per box set, so I like to do an inspection ASAP, so that I can exchange the damaged parts to the store of purchase, right away, before they run out of stock and I have to wait several weeks until they get new stock in) I then discovered that the disc didn't carry the episode commentaries that the individual (and higher priced) DVD's did.

This sucked, because had I known this, I would never have bought the set.

Oh sure, that annoying frame jiggle, when the scenes change, has been removed, but other then that, the 4 disc, Asian import set that I have (which includes all 26 ep's plus the two movies) would have been just fine, and would have saved me the $74.99 Canadian that I plunked down for the new set.

So, my advice is, if you're looking to buy the remasters for the extras, then get the individual discs, but if you don't own the original series and could care about the extras, then this set is much cheaper then the regular box set, and worth the buy.",1134604800,12,1262,4.312236286919831

Evangelion is one of the most complex shows I've yet to see.  If you truly understand the ending of both the end of the show, and the movie, you'll see that the show has come to a satisfying conclusion.

That's where I disagree with the ""Close but no cigar, review"", this show is not about changing your physical reality.  You can never will a door to dissappear.  And this show never says you can.  The point the show is trying to make is that life is what you make of it.  If you believe that you're a good for nothing person, you will become that good for nothing person.  What you believe will shape your life, and as Shinji goes through all the tribulations that occur in the show, he grows and matures until he realizes that he can in fact believe that he is worth something and become in essence, a person.  He decided to face reality.

And yes, Evangelion is not only about False Happiness vs. Harsh Reality, it's also about the identity you gain from being around other people, inferiority complexes, love, betrayal, tons of different things.  And for the most part, I believe the show's points.

I don't believe that you can in actuality, change your physical surroundings, however, you can change how you percieve them, and that's the point.

As a buy, I've heard that this boxset does not include the little dvd booklets that give you tidbits of important info that were included with the original relase of the Platinum Version:

A dictionary of all terms in Eva
A timeline
Angel Analysis
Screenshots of characters
Commentary on Episodes
Info on Evangelions

I purchased the original release of the Platinum Version, and am glad I did so, because the extras in the booklets helped to illuminate many mysteries in the show.  However, if you don't care about those, then this is a much better buy.

$45 vs. 150

8044840,1,B000767QTA,"Back about ten - fifteen years ago I became aware of this series and the follow up features it spawned . Actually first got involved with the model kits that were border line Henti but still Rei , Asuka Misato and the penguin were highly attractive items and the metaphysical story line seemed to be got to have stuff. So I got ahold of the entire collection with an English dub and began to watch what I assumed would be a memorable experience. Well the first episode was a world class bore, a bunch of dull teens with the primary plot element beer. Bad start I figured , something to contrast the mundane world of teens with what was surely to come. Well I labored alon until the beginning of episode seven and Asuka had yet to appear and I still did not have one shred of interest. This is about as much interest as the TV series Lost....that is to say none. Several great Playstation games have come from Japan. Games that have atmosphere and thrills. NGE  is a flat tire. no way coulf this story get all that much better after such a where's the beef  beginning. Better to go back to PS! games for quality.",1469664000,,1111,4.336538461538462

8044844,5,B000767QTA,"The Platinum Complete Collection is probably the best release of Neon Genesis Evangelion in for English viewers. It has amazing video quality, the subtitles look good, the script flows well, and it is a well made product. The inclusion of both the original episodes 21-24 as well as directors cut versions is nice, and this release is leaps and bounds above the older ""Perfect Collection"". The only thing that would make this better is some of the extra bits you get from the individual Platinum releases, but that is honestly pretty minor. Unfortunately the price makes it hard for anyone who's looking to get into Eva to make the leap, but for a massive or longtime fan I believe it is worth the money.",1453766400,2,704,4.685483870967742
8044845,5,B000767QTA,"If your a fan of anime Neon Genesis Evangelion is a mandatory entry on your list of must see. The anime is not for viewing pleasure but for shock. Don't expect any rainbows and butterflies in the end this is not Sword Art Online, I repeat this is not Sword Art Online kind of story.

Neon Genesis Evangelion is as dark and twisted as an anime can be in a psychological perspective, the characters are well portrayed weaklings, whiners and just plain horrible people, but what makes this anime so great is how real the anime gets. There are no overpowered heroes, only characters struggling with their own weaknesses. The best psychological anime out there. Sadly the fans wanted a different ending. They are not contented with scribbles, random snapshots of meaningless s*** and some 40 minute psychological euphoria courtesy of the protagonist's festering psyche. Instead there is another alternate ending where the story was shove in a dark corner and we all took a punch in the face.",1444780800,,986,4.834319526627219
