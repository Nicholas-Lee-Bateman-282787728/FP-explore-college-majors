4698735,5,B005GYXO76,"The practitioner says it all when at some point in the DVD she says yoga is not supposed to feel uncomfortable --- or something to that effect.  This is soothing yoga, with enough challenge to get a good workout.  It is not ""power"" yoga, but as a rotation in your collection as an ""easier"" type of day, this is perfect.  She adds some yoga based innovations, which were appreciated,  to break out of the same old routine that some dvd's offer.  I also like the length of the work outs  --  25 min or so each, fits right into my schedule!!",1359504000,5,538,4.267326732673268
4698736,4,B005GYXO76,"This yoga DVD is short with 20 minute segments.  I suffer from chronic pain, the shortened segments and stretching really helps.",1358640000,4,128,5.095238095238095
4698737,4,B005GYXO76,"This is a great video, especially if you want a shorter workout or just a good and quick stretch. I am very happy that I made this purchase. I have a large collection of workout and yoga videos and this is now one of my favorites. I personally feel better, more energized and healthy after using it. I highly recommend it. If you are new to yoga though, I suggest you watch it through first before doing it, it can be slightly difficult to follow if you are not used to the poses.",1355270400,10,480,4.172043010752688
4698738,5,B005GYXO76,This is definitely one of the very best Yoga DVD's that I have had. Very good cueing so that you can flow thru it without haveing to look at the screen. You will find yourself in the pose and in the moment. She is motivating and puts forth positive energy. I recommend this DVD for anyone. I have tried several and have very few favorites BUT this is definetely going to be a favorite. It is motivating and energizing. She gives plenty of options on each pose so whether you have been practicing for a while or just beginning you will find yourself flowing through the poses. She uses the sanskrit and common terms for the poses so you don't have to be pro. It moves at a good pace.,1355184000,13,682,4.253846153846154
4698739,5,B005GYXO76,Been doing this yoga DVD for a couple of years now even through pregnancy (first 20 minutes) and it has great benefits from the stretching. I sleep better and have better posture.,1392768000,,179,4.625
4698740,5,B005GYXO76,"A GREAT way to wake up! The instructor's voice is calming and the poses are easy to follow. I am very critical of ""yoga"" videos. Most of them are arobics pretending to be yoga. But Canyon Ranch is truly a yoga video that you'll find yourself addicted to.",1382918400,,254,4.3125
4698741,5,B005GYXO76,"I like doing these yoga workouts. They're challenging, but not intensely difficult (which I like because I'm a beginner to yoga). Evette, the instructor, has a very mellow voice and positive energy, and the outdoor desert setting is lovely. The 2 main workouts are great. I normally don't do the Cool Down option, but I enjoy alternating between the Energetic Yoga Flow (24 mins.) and the Energy Stretch (22 mins.) on different days, and when I don't have a lot of time I do the 11-minute Bonus Stretch. Very pleased with this purchase.",1379721600,2,536,4.774193548387097
4698742,4,B005GYXO76,never been into yoga but this video has helped me a great deal with new exercise regimen. I found that I feel better when I do some of these poses and it breaks me up from the same cardio and other exercise routines.,1370822400,,216,4.046511627906977
4698743,4,B005GYXO76,"If you wake up one morning and need a stretch, but not a full workout, put this in your DVD and after 20-25 minutes, you will feel invigorated and ready to hit the day.  Beautiful scenery and likeable yoga teacher, too!",1369612800,4,219,4.341463414634147
4698744,5,B005GYXO76,"Sorry for the late review.  Super fast shipping, great price and I love the peace and serenity I get being able to breath and unwind after working with so much stress.  Thank you, love this dvd.",1369008000,,194,4.361111111111111
4698745,3,B005GYXO76,"Sequencing didn't have the total effect of the title. Instruction was general, but not detailed. Voice modulation was very pleasing.",1366070400,,132,5.65
4698746,4,B005GYXO76,"I found it easy to follow even if some moves I found a bit difficult for a beginner.
Very well explained. I would like to see the order changed with the final cool own at the end so you don't have to keep adjusting the dvd to play it at the end.",1361404800,,245,3.730769230769231
4698747,3,B005GYXO76,"Although there was nothing new about the routine, it flowed nicely and there is easy to follow instruction (missing in an awful lot of these videos).  The scenery is peaceful...........all in all a solid workout; but nothing spectacular.",1360800000,,237,5.2368421052631575
4698748,5,B005GYXO76,"I adore this DVD, exactly what I was hoping for and I have practiced yoga for several years. I have done yoga out and at home, this one is worth it, just refreshingly different from what I have been practicing over the years.",1360195200,3,225,4.255813953488372
8472454,4,B005GYXO76,"Beautiful scenery. It's a different flow than I am used to but did help me feel better. I usually do the 20 minute session and it is a video I come back to often. It is good to watch a couple of times first as the cues don't always make sense until you see what she is talking about. I have not watched the healthy cooking sessions all the way through yet so can not comment on that. I will sometimes put it on when I am trying to rest because the scenery, flow, and voice are calming (and I usually fall asleep).",1466812800,,513,3.9902912621359223
8472455,5,B005GYXO76,My friend recommended this yoga CD,1445126400,,34,4.833333333333333
8472456,5,B005GYXO76,This was my first exposure to yoga. I felt amazing when I was done. That was a nice surprise. Good for beginners and seniors like me.,1438819200,,133,4.153846153846154
8472457,4,B005GYXO76,Feel good after sessions but title screen does not align with actual segments so you don't know what you will get,1437091200,,113,4.428571428571429
8472458,4,B005GYXO76,I really like having two yoga options to start my day. Both are less than 30 minutes and offer a great stretch.,1433808000,,111,4.090909090909091
8472459,5,B005GYXO76,great workout. Very happy. Love outdoor setting. :),1428192000,,51,5.5
8472460,5,B005GYXO76,"Love this DVD so much, it is well done in the amount of time used. Very peaceful, not a lot of chatter. I would highly recommend this to anyone at any age.",1412121600,,155,3.875

8472462,5,B005GYXO76,Love this 20 minute quick but thorough Canyon Ranch CD.  It is a perfect 20 minute stretch and relaxation workout.,1407369600,,114,4.7
8472463,5,B005GYXO76,"I am really glad I made this purchase.  I like the instructor, pleasant voice, positive attitude.  The 2 main yoga routines are easy enough to follow yet challenging as well for  me.  I also like the short stretch (~10 min).  I've used it on mornings that I'm running late & don't have time to do a 20 or 30 min. routine.  I would definitely recommend this dvd especially to people who prefer 20-25 min. routines over longer ones.",1394841600,2,430,4.448717948717949
