He is very knowledgeable and caring for his horses almost like there family and friends.  He has been a great mentor and the video is a great start in your video library if horses are what you want to persue as a carrer or hobby.  Thanks Jack, you've helped me alot....",1279929600,,384,4.162162162162162
8309451,5,B001HSJWTE,I've found that horse racing videos are few and far between.  This video is a great introduction to thoroughbred racing and training from a hall of fame trainer.  It covers all aspects of owning and training race horses.  If you love horse racing then you will love this video.,1248652800,,277,4.612244897959184
