1916111,3,B0000CABE6,"Lara Croft as played by Angelina Jolie is a female cross between James Bond and Indiana Jones. Angelina joins the ranks of Harrison Ford, Bruce Lee etc. as a natural action hero. Sure the film doesn't make much sence but Angelina makes it worthwile. This is her calling.",1059264000,2,270,4.645833333333333
1916112,4,B0000CABE6,"LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE is a good sequel. I'd say it's no better or worse than the first TOMB RAIDER movie. I think most fans will think I'm crazy and say this a FAR better than Tomb 1. And, in some obvious regards, it is much better. The editing and cinematography is A-list. The score is better. Even Angie is better (more on this later). But this may lead one to conclude the movie is better directed. It's not. Jan de Bont is a hack and it shows. This movie suffers from all the same faults as the first. The pacing is clunky, and some of the action sequences are very awkward and confusing. Add to that a very poor villain. Casting is the job of a director, and this movie is not as well cast as it could have been -- outside of our lead, of course.
Speaking of our lead...SHE IS ON FIRE! Angelina Jolie IS Lara Croft. She is a much better Lara in this movie. She's frighteningly intense and beautiful and surprisingly violent. She's like a dangerous, wild animal ready to lunge. The amazing Ms Jolie absolutely holds this movie above the waterline (as she did the first movie), helped, like I said, by superior cinematography and editing. We get lots and lots of Angie close-ups, and watching her wild eyes is one of the great joys of watching this movie. In fact, she IS the reason to see this movie.
Like I said, the action is very hit and miss. There is more hard action (shoot-outs, breaking glass, fist-fights) in this movie than Tomb 1. It's more James Bond, less Raiders, and I'm not sure I like that. I like seeing my Lara romp around tombs and jungles, not shooting it out inside a Hong Kong bio-lab. The quiet moments are all quite good. But Angie's male partner is awkwardly shoehorned into the plot. I really don't know why he's in this movie, except to provide a little... tension (and maybe that's reason enough). But there is one very surprising beat between them during the climax, which, momentarily, took the movie beyond expectations for me.
Is this a review? I don't know. I'm still processing. I liked the movie. I really did. I'll see it again. I can't wait to get the DVD. But it is definitely ""Tomb Raider 2"" and don't expect it to rise above whatever expectations you have when you hear that title.",1059091200,10,2248,4.419277108433735
1916113,4,B0000CABE6,"Because the Tomb Raider video game series from which Lara Croft originates made much ado about her physical assets, I readily confess to some trepidation approaching this movie.
Unlike 1992's Buffy The Vampire Slayer which was unarguably low-budget camp (and downplayed eroticism in favor of slapstick laughs), this franchise was advertising female liberation as an inseparable pairing from rather traditional ideals about sexual liberation. Lara's brains and physical strength were emphasized in tandem with her sexuality, a point explicitly highlighted (and re-highlighted) by previous media reviewers and magazines wanting audiences to know exactly what they were going to get with this character.
Frankly, I was frightened it was nothing more than Baywatch does archeology. Still, on a lark I went to the local theater, and found the title highly enjoyable, and the previously stated assumption proven wrong.
Angelina Jolie is a modern day Bond oozing with grrrl power: no matter where she goes she has connections to a mysterious informant who knows her from back when and can help her get exactly what she needs to save the day. Croft is bold, daring and physically resiliant---able to fend off an endless stream of attackers with the most minimal gadgets and nearby objects. Although she works with the British M-16 organization (equivalent to the American FBI) the audience repeatedly learns they are not much help and instead must rely on her (an 'outsider') to save the day and put everything to rights.
Because most of these same interactions (however platonic)are with men and confiding in other women as equally is not present throughout the same screenplay, it is not a 'grrrl's night out film' in the sense that women are working together to save the day. In order to be non-traditional (and enjoy the privlleges this designation subsequently brings such as awesome gagets...etc, Croft must simmultaneously appear conventionally attractive while strictly engaging in non-traditional association patterns.
That said, Croft refrains from sleeping with these same men and the emphasis is on her work as opposed to a 'soft' romantic storyline (which is repeatedly toyed with through out several scenes).
In an action film market still dominated by binary deliniations between good and bad, the ending is truly suprising and (if not usual in Western culture) interesting proverbial food for thought.",1059091200,6,2409,5.358839050131926
1916114,3,B0000CABE6,"... is quite entertaining and as usual, excellent. honestly, i think she's believable as croft, and i really, really liked the first movie. unfortunately, i think this one fails to live up to the expectations.
hey, i'm not a demanding moviegoer, and i do enjoy mindless entertainment  on a regular basis. except, TOMB RAIDER was not only pure entertainment, it was also believable. well okay, not totally believable, but other than the supernatural aspect of whatever artifact that croft always encounter, jolie makes croft a 3 dimensional character, making it more than just a heroine trying to save the world.
CRADLE OF LIFE unfortunately, lacks the certain something that made TOMB RAIDER special. for me, it lacks the emotional depth of the first movie. while croft had to come to terms with her father's death in the first, the human interest in this one is barely original - there's the need to avenge friends and the return of an ex-lover - with none of he tight scripting and great plot of it's predecessor.
to my jaded eyes this movie looks like an expensive advertisement and the producers blatantly used product placement to rake in the advertising money, while leaving the artistic aspect of the movie (the plot, in this case) to languish and plods along throughout the movie like a forgotten piece of prop. i have nothing against product placement and all that jazz, but when that is used to cover a flimsy and superficial plot, i get roaring mad. it's not a pretty sight.
CRADLE OF LIFE concerns the race to get to THE pandora's box. here croft is joined by an old friend in the search of this box. but before that they have to get their hands on the map that will lead them to the erstwhile unknown residence of the box. this is actually not that far off in formula compared to the original, but man, execution of the plot is... rather poor and the story meandering. should have spent the millions to tighten it...
man, this could have been a really, really excellent movie.
jolie as lara: 5 stars
plot and execution: 1 star
too bad! hope they come up with a better one soon...",1059091200,,2092,4.654054054054054
1916115,5,B0000CABE6,"In a new action-packed sequel, Angelina Jolie is the daring and eccentric Lara Croft once again. Producer Lloyd Levin says, ""Our difficulty was how to up the ante and make it a bigger and better epic in every conceivable way without repeating what we had already done before."" Well, working together to do this, visual effects director Jan De Bont and Angelina herself succeed in producing the kind of stunts that make your blood pump.
If there's ever a successful sequel to a James Bond/Indiana Jones type of movie that headlines a female lead, this is going to be it. And I put Tomb Raider in the same category as James Bond and Indiana Jones with ease; this series is going to be the next best thing, if not the next better thing. Also, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life is not simply a continuation or an almost exact repeat of its predecessor; it's a whole new adventure.
Get ready for another hit of Lara's lock and load lesson.",1058486400,2,939,4.529411764705882

1916152,1,B0000CABE6,"Seriously now, ...this movie is nothing more than a sequence of highly unlikely events, followed by highly improbable events, followed by even more highly ridiculous ones.
Now if you can successfully de-brain yourself to endure such inanities then this might entertain you, but if you possess even so much as half a functioning neurone, then you will be unable to suspend disbelief for even a few moments, let alone the dragged out time this movie seems to take to sit through.
ALL the baddies are hopelessly inaccurate shots unable to hit their targets despite firing a hail of bullets from rapid fire assault weapons, yet Lara and her male side-kick are of course dead-eyes and never miss! They run through fusillades unscathed!
Lara is as agile as a circus acrobat, and just so ""kick-arse"" and smug that I just wanted to see somebody belt the living crap out of her for once!
Seriously irritating!
However the image that remains with me out of all this over-CGI-ed steaming turgid pile would have to be the SHRIEKING shark !
I kid you not!
Who knew that sharks could scream? And underwater too?
Croft cuts herself and hangs around on the bottom until a shark shows up attracted by the blood, punches it in the nose, then proceeds to hitch a ride to the surface on its dorsal fin, all the while holding her breathe for about ten minutes.
Now if you can watch incidents such as that and refrain from some serious disbelief then you are probably watching the movie fully medicated within your own padded cell.
I rivaled that screaming shark by the end, with my own shouting at the absurdities of this nonsensical, over-long, self-reverential piece of pseudo-historical histrionics.

Like George Lucas who wanted his Star Wars franchise to appeal to a much more younger audience he introduce goofy things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks. You get the idea. Here Jollie tries to appease a younger audience to making what should be better off as a PG 13 movie. She devalues this horrible movie by adding this one-world hippy love and respect idea as the basis for the plot.

The actions scenes were serving a visual need to have action for the sake of action.

In both of her Tomb Raider movies she does some stunts that clearly involve wires and cgi, but they are almost believable. This is the sequel to the original Tomb Raider movie. I liked it and recommend that you watch it.

1916315,1,B0000CABE6,This movie is an exercise in suspension; you have to suspend disbelief for so long that you get tired of hanging on. The first bit of suspension involves Angalina and acting: she can't. She's no super hero either (unless repeated glaring and growling at the camera is a stand-in). Sometimes the acting is so bad it's comical. The plot line is a joke. The movie is the basis for a video game. That's all the good stuff I can say about the movie.,1417996800,2,444,4.36144578313253

1916322,4,B0000CABE6,"Heh, heh, heh!

There she was, Angelina Jolie in all her upper-body ""capability"" and wearing a wardrobe that must qualify as the cheapest this side of a soft-porn film. And, note, the ""pointedness"" of the guidance to the wardrobe folks must have had no more than two points!

Acting? Well, AJ seemed a touch more mature. After all the second movie was a couple of years later. I must say that Gerard Butler must have had a blast doing this film. Lucky guy.

Directing? Again, the film must have been done on a shoestring because once again the director didn't come to many of the scene shoots.

Story/Script? A story about a quest for Pandora's box says it all. And, the script doesn't help much except in the film there are more words this time around.

Production Values? Better than the original but that, unfortunately, doesn't say too much.

Summary. A film that does not do AJ any favors when you compare such work to her ""post film"" personae that casts her as a much more impactful person than her film work would allude too.

Perhaps what we have in AJ is a future California Governor.",1416700800,,1093,4.545918367346939

1916352,4,B0000CABE6,"Picking up where the first one left off Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life was an adventure you won't want to miss.  Laura Croft is at it again and this time she is on a quest to find the mythical Pandora's Box before a corrupt, evil scientist does.  Dean Georgaris was in charge of writing the screenplay for this film while Steven E. de Souza and James V. Hart were the ones that put together the story.  Jan de Bont was the one who directed this film.  Prior to this he had directed films such as Basic Instict, The Hunt for Red October and Die Hard.

Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) has made perhaps the most important archaeological discovery in history and that is an orb that leads to the mythical yet dangerous Pandora's Box.  Unfortunately before Laura and her team are able to leave where they found it they are ambushed.  Her team is killed and she is left for dead as the orb is stolen from her and given to Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), an evil scientist who has created a killer virus and hopes to sell the secrets of the box as the ultimate weapon.  The British Intelligence gets wind of what is happening and does not want Reiss to get his hand on the box so they recruit Laura to get the orb back.  Claiming that the only way to do it is with an old friend Lara recruits Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a British marine turned mercenary to help.  The two of them embark on a journey that takes them across the world in an attempt to find Reiss and get back the orb and prevent him from finding Pandora's Box..

This film is full of adventure which makes it very enjoyable and the scene above was one of my favorites.  I say one of my favorites because there is another scene where she parachutes into a jeep and the guy asked if she ever does anything easy and I think the answer to that is a definite no based off of this film and clearly her escape plan above.  I personally would never try something like this but I can just imagine how thrilling it would be to just run and jump off the building.  To find yourself flying through the sky toward your destination, you would feel so free, it would be amazing.  So many action scenes in this film and they were all amazing and they were put together very well it was a gem to watch.

Overall I would give this movie a B-.  I think this film was better than the first one, granted the idea is one that you probably would only find in a video game but the movie flowed very well and was enjoyable to watch.  There were only two real issues that I had for this film.  The first was after she was left for dead she punches a shark to have it bring her to the surface, now whats to say there is going to be a shark there or that it will swim to the surface once it gets punched?  Second they introduced her former love interest but we don't get their back story at all you just have to figure it out.  If you ignore that though its a fun movie to watch.",1410912000,,2921,4.171122994652406

1916409,4,B0000CABE6,Anything with Angelina is good.  The first Tom Raider was good too.  4 stars as some of the action shots are kind of cheesy.  Mostly due to the technology at the time this movie was made.  Better special effects now.,1392854400,,216,4.325
1916410,4,B0000CABE6,"Thought this movie was fair-to-good, with Lara Croft clearly cut out of the same mold as Indiana Jones.  After seeing so many movies in this genre over the past decade, the storyline seemed a bit derivative when viewed in the present.  In all fairness, though, I suppose that this movie probably predates many of the movies to which I refer.  Regardless, I would recommend this to anyone who needs the quicker pace of an action adventure movie to stay awake.",1392508800,,458,4.7

1916418,3,B0000CABE6,"Great Actors but,...maybe it was the script? I was never drawn in. It was not believable in action or interpersonal.

Angelina Jolie wears the finest underwater diving outfit worn by a woman in her Santorini dive. Sexy is an understatement. From Greece to England to adventures all over China to Africa and a mysterious forest a la the Wizard of Oz but with worse bad guys than just flying monkeys there is a bit of everything here. Great helicopter scenes, skydiving, underwater action, gunfights it's all here. The romance tension is woven also, on the light side. Enjoy.",1389398400,,581,4.696078431372549

1916450,3,B0000CABE6,The movie has lots of action and Angelina Jolie in tight-fitting spandex in cold air and water. Need I say more? OK... I really should because even I think I sound like a pig. I like the Tomb Raider series... it's great action and in stunning scenery. Jolie's Croft character shows real affection for a former love and you get the feeling that she's going to soften but then she shows the tough Croft we've come to expect. That's the real story in this film; the catalyst being the cradle of life is shaky at best... it's just a vehicle to show us that Croft's got feelings that she can control.,1387238400,,595,4.36936936936937

1916457,4,B0000CABE6,"You have to know what to expect going into a movie like this.  A lot of action, stunts, fighting and special effects.  The plot and story is really only there to support the other elements, not to carry the movie.  That and to show Angelina Jolie in as many skimpy and/or skin tight outfits as possible.  Between the two movies, I think the first one had the better story overall, but even that was not ground breaking.

As was the case with the first movie, this one has a ton of great location shots.  From the middle of the ocean to the middle of Hong Kong, and into Africa.  The story revolves around the search for Pandora's box, which when opened will release a plague that will kill millions of people.  Lara has to stop the film's bad guy from finding and opening the box.  That is the basic plot in a nutshell.  It is not very deep or tough to follow.

For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds very good on it.  There are several relatively short (15 min and under) behind the scenes and making of featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, Gerard Butler's screen test and a couple music videos.  Not tons but enough to satisfy most people who like to go through the extras.

Ultimately, if you enjoy the genre and liked the first movie you will probably like this one.  If you did not like the first movie, or were lukewarm to it at best, then you probably will not like this one because the tone is similar, with in my opinion a slightly weaker story.",1382745600,2,1478,4.323636363636363

1916460,2,B0000CABE6,"The first Tomb Raider movie was fun, over the top, and had great music in it. This one drags on, isn't fun, and good music has been replaced with an awful repetitive score. Its only redeeming quality is Angelina eye candy. It's not that the story couldn't be interesting, it's that the quality of nearly everything else isn't good. Outside of Lara, the performances are too serious. The score just grates on you. The editing isn't tight, and for an action movie, often lacks the spatial context to understand what's going on. It's unfortunate that the franchise essentially died this way, after the first movie was so fun.",1382054400,,622,4.768518518518518

Perhaps more plot and behind the scenes planning which had to occur between the traveling which our heroine does would have made this a much better film.  As it is, the action is very well executed with Angelina Jolie at her absolute best flawlessly executing the stuntwork.  The man who plays the villain does a very capable job and indeed adds much to this movie as a character to root against.  Nice underwater action and some good special effects particularly in the tunnel leading to the cradle of life.

1916476,3,B0000CABE6,"First off.... it's a movie based on a video game character that's very reminiscent of a female Indiana Jones.  So when I review something like this it's based on a subjective view I have for a movie of this type relative to its peers in this genre.

In short - 3 stars.  This could have been better.  Acting was wooden. Angelina is capable of better acting but it didn't come through here. The premise & story was ok.  I think there could have been more imaginative ways of approaching the legend of Pandora's box.

In that period of time, there was plenty of action, lots of posing, and multiple views of fake nipples (If you don't know they're fake, you don't understand Hollywood) showing through Angelina's wet suit.

What it lacked was a storyline. Mystery isn't a bad thing, but there should be some sort of a hint of a plot 30 minutes into the movie, or I'm gone. Without a decent story, the movie should have never been marketed as anything but extra-soft-core porn.",1372896000,,545,4.618556701030927

What we get is leaping, pirouetting, two hand weapon displays, and an assortment of stunts, with little but  straight-ahead action. It was fun but, I thought, a little long. After awhile stunts and ancient fixed scenes from hundreds of movies, gets a bit tedious. Perhaps I just got exhausted watching with nothing much of interest occurring between stunts.  Of course, the star, Jolie, a dozen years younger, is lithe, agile and comely. Her supporting players range in quality from good to
barely adequate; but, they are just, for the most part, intended only to be garnish on the  STAR, a task they accomplish handily. Recommended for all who can forgot reality for a while and concentrate on story book creations redesigned for the screen.",1371168000,,904,4.745222929936306

1916718,4,B0000CABE6,"A massive earthquake on an island in Greece uncovers an ancient temple built by Alexander the Great.  It is here he stored his most prized possessions captured when he conquered the ancient world civilizations.  Treasure hunters swarm the waters off of the coast looking for ancient artifacts but Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) arrives and she believes the new temple is the ancient Luna Temple and that is what she wants to get into first.

The Luna temple would be the greatest archeological find ever made.  Lara dives and finds a glowing orb but it is stolen from her team by a competing group of treasure robbers who will go to any means to get all the items.  Lara escapes with her life and a medallion while the two men on her team are killed.  The medallion has a method to unlock the secrets of the orb.  The orb is rumored to be the key to find the Cradle of Life which is the hiding place for Pandora's Box which legend says contains a deadly plague that could mean the end of life on earth....

This is an excellent action movie and Jolie does a great job portraying the athletic and fearless Lara Croft.  She is fantastic in the role playing the intelligent and warrior like archeologist with aggressive desire to simply be the best in the world.  She is constantly training and she is doing so when she is recruited by the British Secret Service.  Her knowledge of ancient history and the fast action stunts and special effects make this movie a good one to watch.  It is filmed in exotic locations all around the globe and the cinematography is outstanding in this film.

1916727,4,B0000CABE6,"Two years after looting the box office as if it were just another one of her tomb excursions... Lara Croft returns. Featuring a better story, better action, better drama, and dare I say, an even better looking Angelina (as if that were possible); ""Lara Croft - Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" is a superior movie to its predecessor in almost every way possible.

""Lara Croft - Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" finds Lara taking on one of the greatest challenges of her life: recovering the mythical root of evil, Pandora's Box. To do so will force Lara to trust an ex-lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), who also happens to be a dangerous mercenary with no apparent qualms over betraying anyone and everyone to get what he wants. Meanwhile, a power-hungry scientist (Ciaran Hinds) seeks the Box in hopes of unlocking all of its secrets with no regard for the danger it may pose to humanity. With time running out, Lara and Terry must travel far and wide to discover the Box's location before something horrific happens.

While the original movie, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was an enjoyable guilty pleasure, the sequel is an all-out entertaining action adventure film. Taking all of the best components of the original and building a solid story upon them; this is one sequel that is not content with merely rehashing what's come before.

The first time around the focus seemed to be solely on getting from one action set piece to another. In this outing, written by Dean Georgaris (""The Manchurian Candidate"" remake) the focus is placed squarely on the plot, allowing it to propel the story forward rather than the action (of which there is still aplenty). The story is much more dramatic and intriguing; obviously, Georgaris' story was crafted with more thought and care so that his film would be held in a higher regard by fans over the previous one. As with most sequels the goal should always be to outdo the previous film, clearly Georgaris and director Jan de Bont understood this as they definitely upped the ante on this movie in every respect.

The quest for Pandora's Box was a much more interesting choice of quarry for Lara to pursue as opposed to The Triangle of Light. Even though the Illuminati's plans for the Triangle would have been world threatening, they pale in comparison to the unparalleled evil that could be unleashed if Pandora's Box were to be opened or entrusted into the wrong hands. While the search in the first film was full of adventure and took the audience to numerous locales around the globe, it never seemed to feel big enough in scope. While I can't say with certainty that ""Cradle of Life"" goes to any more locations than its predecessor, it does however feel much more epic as the adventure is on a much grander scale than before. This is something that all adventure films such as this should strive for, and it was nice to see ""Cradle of Life"" delivered from start to finish.

Another area of this film that benefited greatly from the shift in focus was the lead character of Lara Croft. The original gave us only the smallest morsels of character development in regards to Lara and even less for her supporting characters. ""Cradle of Life"" provides a more emotionally developed heroine in Lara Croft than previously seen in her film or video games. For instance, we get to see her struggle with certain situations and/or people along her journey. Not everything with this mission was as black and white as it was before; thus, a more vulnerable side to the beloved video game icon was introduced to audiences. The result of this newfound vulnerability and/or humanity as it were, is a more fully realized character and one that the audience can relate to a little easier than before.

Another obvious weak spot in the previous film were the special effects, some of which were good while others not so much. For this sequel to succeed, the special effects were a major area in need of a significant overhaul. From a visual effects perspective, ""Cradle of Life"" benefited from having a director more familiar with the inclusion of CGI elements into action sequences. Jan de Bont's previous experience directing such films as, ""Twister"" and ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", both films featuring plenty of graphically intensive visual effects sequences, made him far better suited to this film's proceedings than the previous director [Simon West].

This time around, the effects were more realistic, visually exciting, and above all believable. Not having the effects in the movie be mostly science-fiction and/or fantasy related (as was the case in the original), allowed them to feel more natural within the scenes. Previously, the effects were far too obvious, which has a tendency to remove some audience members from the proceedings; however, the CGI employed here were more polished and even subtle at times. For adventure films (especially those in the vein of Indiana Jones) I think it's a better choice to make the CGI appear indiscernible as to whether it's practical or virtual; instead of being so blatantly in your face computer generated imagery that it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.

Now, let's take a brief look at the acting in this movie. Leading the way once more is actress Angelina Jolie, obviously reprising her role as Lara Croft. This time around Angelina is fully in her element as Lara, completely confident and sure of herself and her skill sets. Along with this newfound confidence in the role came some surprising moments of vulnerability as Lara's story arc carried much more depth to it than anything found in the previous film. Angelina, as she has shown in countless other films, excels in mining the emotional depths of a character, and apparently that holds true even if she is portraying a video game creation as well. That's not to say that this role would have ever won her any critical acclaim. I was just pleased to see her take the role seriously as she played Lara with more complexity than perhaps other actresses would have if given the opportunity.

Joining Angelina on screen is Gerard Butler (""300"") as her former lover and betrayer of not only her, but their country as well. Gerard does well enough in the role and seems to really be enjoying himself as the supposedly cold, heartless mercenary. Of course, who could blame him? After all, most of his scenes are opposite Angelina Jolie, that's enough for any man to enjoy showing up to work.

Actor Djimon Hounsou (""Constantine"") shows up in a very small role as a former associate of Lara's living in Africa. It's a shame that such a talented actor is so underrated and underutilized in not just this movie, but so many others that he's been a part of. His character showed potential to be very interesting, but in the ten to fifteen minutes of screen time he received we never really got to see any of it come to fruition. His was a role that more could have and should have been done with, rather than giving his time to less interesting players over the two-hour duration.

As for the villain of the story, character actor Ciaran Hinds (""Race to Witch Mountain"") plays everything fairly one-note as the scientist seeking Pandora's Box for his own malevolent needs. Personally, I was hoping that after the first film's villain was portrayed so flatly and one-dimensional; perhaps the creative forces behind the sequel would attempt to go farther this time. Truthfully, a well-conceived villainous role would have definitely elevated the movie even more; especially if it's apparent that he/she is an equal to the hero/heroine figure. In Ciaran's case, his character never once seemed to be on equal footing with Lara or even Terry for that matter. Despite making almost every other facet of this movie better than the original, it's disappointing that when it comes to the film's primary antagonist that the movie settles for mediocrity once again.

Finally, ""Lara Croft - Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" delivers to fans a Tomb Raider movie that is action-packed and very entertaining, without skimping so much on the story this time around. If you enjoyed the original film, or even if you didn't, I can say with a relative degree of certainty that you will enjoy this one ever more.

This film is definitely a worthy addition to the Croft mythos sending Lara in search of not so mythical Pandora's Box.

As with the film the production values are first rate, the action fast and furious and Angelina looks fantastic. The inclusion of Gerard Butler as fellow treasure hunter and Lara's love interest is also a welcome addition to the cast. On the slightly negative side, I found the dialogue not quite as crisp as in the first film and the exclusion of that tight fitting, bluish-purple shorts outfit of Lara's was an unfortunate choice.

As far as the plot, I liked the premise and the execution of the storyline for the most part but was marginally disappointed by the ending. It wasn't quite as spectacular as one might have expected.

However in general this is just an overblown blockbuster with a plot thats similar to that used in the Indiana Jones films. After an admittedly promising beginning this rapidly descends into stunt after stunt followed by explosion after explosion then gun battle after gun battle and unarmed combat fight ad-nauseum. Credit where credit is due the stunts are well done, and I believe that Jolie did many herself.

So if you like films of this type then this for you - it'll be a great film you should buy regardless of how much Amazon are selling it for. For me it needed a better script and more characterisation. The combination of these two changes could easily have been done at the expense of a few stunts/explosions/fights.

Therefore I had a little bit higher of plateau of entertainment expectations.  This movie definitely satisfied those expectations.  3 1/2 stars worth.

I did notice the emphasis taken off of Angelina Jolie's character in this go-around, like some other viewers.  The camera seemed to love the male character just a bit more.

1916744,4,B0000CABE6,"A funny thing happened on the way to exploiting Angelina Jolie in this sort of clunky but sorta fun movie.  The camera took a look at Gerard Butler and couldn't stop. His first scene establishes him as the film's real leading character and Ms. Jolie takes a back seat despite her daring stunts.  The fact is that this is the first movie I've seen where the camera seems more interested in the leading man's face than the gorgeous, full lipped heroine's.

You know how when a steamy love scene is shot the camera usually lingers on the woman's face and the audience sees the back of the guy's head?  Some directors say that's the only way to shoot a sexy scene, because the audience wants to see how the female is taking the lovin'.  But here the camera is on Butler's face,  registering his reactions--most unusual, and when that's over and he's out of the story for a while, it's hard to get back with Lara and take an interest in what she's risking her life for.  She's really not a woman one can easily connect with.  Her Ladyship Croft maintains a lofty smile as she does her tricks without breaking a sweat.  To help her out, the bad guys are particularly klutzy.

The finale seems somehow off; maybe the director was wise to use it, though.  The alternate ending seen on the DVD extras, again puts Lara in the wrong place, and that silly camera goes right i and dares to reveal its fascination with Butler again!  An audience might have a tear for it, which is never called for in this sort of cartoonish action flick. Still, as I said, it's a bit of fun.",1148083200,5,1561,4.400696864111498

This movie wasn't even a poor man's Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It wasn't anything!  Anything, that is, except trite, boring, superficial...

If you enjoy watching Angelina Jolie strutting around acting like everything and everyone around her is incredibily inferior and quite beneath her dignity, then this is the movie for you.

I was beyond disappointment with this film.  The only reason I watched all of it was for Gerard Butler who did his absolute best to bring depth to a poorly written, barely two dimensional character.

If I sound bitter, I am.  I expected so much more given the quality of the stars involved.  In fact, I almost, based solely on the cast, purchased this film without having seen it first.  Thank God I caught it on cable first.  I should have given credence to the fact that this movie is based on a video game.  Talk about two dimensional.

If I truly wanted to see this type of adventure story I'd go see a James Bond movie where a man plays the main character with a strong arm and sexy type role.  I don't need to see a woman doing it.  Having said that and in my own defence I only bought this movie because I collect Gerard Butler movies. As I've said before, I believe he is one of the future greats (if he's not already) and as such I enjoy watching both his role playing and his career.  I believe Angelina said she wanted a strong male lead playing opposite her and that as far as I am concerned is what she got, and it showed.  I feel the lines he was fed was staged to make her look good and to show that it was her film and she was the star.  He took what I thought was poor material and did an excellent job, as usual.

A marked improvement over its predecessor, CRADLE still promises more than it delivers, and it has the kind of frustrating start-and-stop pacing that makes you feel like you're riding in a car that keeps breaking down just as it begins to accelerate. The basic problem is that no amount of slickly executed stunts and costly CGI effects can compensate for a main character that's a cold fish. Though Angelina Jolie's impressive physical attributes fill the visual requirements of the role, the filmmakers have yet to provide Lara Croft with any discernible personality. The character, like the movie itself, is soulless and ill defined. Given the aesthetic limitations of a film based on a video game, there's still a chance that a good Lara Croft movie can be made, although it's debatable if there's still a market for a third go-round.",1132876800,2,1249,4.868544600938967
1916750,5,B0000CABE6,"I really like this movie. there is alot of action from beginning to end. one of the stunts are pretty cool, like when Lara Croft flips her Jet-Ski and lands right side up. it sucked when Lara had to shoot Terry Sheridan, but he wouldn't listen to her. this movie was longer than the first Tomb Raider, and more exciting too.

1916753,3,B0000CABE6,"Angelina Jolie returns as a distaff Indiana Jones in ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life,"" an action/adventure film (based on a video game character) that is just goofy enough and inane enough to be almost entertaining.

In this follow-up adventure - which is designed to give historians and social studies teachers a severe case of the heebie-jeebies - Lara, the world-famous archaeologist and adventurist, finds evidence that the mythical Pandora's Box is really no myth at all, but rather an actual object loaded with enough plague and pestilence to wipe the entire human race off the face of the planet.  It lies buried somewhere, hidden by Alexander the Great in the 4th Century B.C. when he  discovered how virulent and deadly the contents of the box really were.  Now, twenty-four centuries later, Lara has to try and prevent an evil billionaire capitalist from locating the container, prying open the lid, and bringing an end to civilization as we know it.

Though the storyline is clearly not one to be conjured with, all that really matters in a movie such as this one is that the action move quickly and the stunts be sufficiently enterprising to engage the audience.  Credibility is the last prerequisite in a Lara Croft adventure, as evidenced by the fact that if Lara isn't parachuting smack dab onto the deck of a ship or into the passenger seat of a moving jeep, she's hitching a ride on the back of a great white shark and riding it to safety.  Ah well, it's all in good fun, I suppose, and Jolie not only looks stunning in all the outfits she's been given to wear, but seems to be having a fine time playing along with the joke.

The ending is inevitably anticlimactic, but viewers can have a pretty good time getting there at least.",1123718400,2,1755,4.693811074918567
1916754,4,B0000CABE6,"One up on the last one. Unlike regular sequels where the second is worse than the first & the third is worse than the second etc... the Tomb Raider franchisees have gone against the tide.

Pandora's Box is an intriguing subject just like the illuminati were in the first film, like its predecessor the cradle of life has no shortage of exotic locations, myths & human paranoia, it's a shame they did not open the Box.

As I said in my previous review Angelina Jolie was born to play that part of Lara Croft. From the first scene onwards you can't help but mistake the voluptuous cyber chic for Jolie. Something else caught my eye that I never realized in the first part; her accent; she does a pretty damn good impression of a sophisticated Brit. Having lived in the U.K. myself I can tell the difference.

This movie does not disappoint at all in being a pop-corn flick. With all the pre-requisites of a big budget action/adventure movie, i.e.  dim-witted yet attitudinal villains, death defying stunts, tense & exciting action scenes, futuristic gadgets & an insignificant romantic segment, this movie does not fail to entertain.

Verdict: scrupulously enjoyable. A great movie for Tomb Raider/Angelina Jolie fans. Jolie is the true living form of the Cyber divinity known as Lara Croft (even though her padded bra is quite obvious at times). The only disappointment is not being able to see inside Pandora's Box.

Rating: 4 stars for being better than the first.",1121040000,6,1465,4.7936507936507935
1916755,5,B0000CABE6,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life didn't match the box office success of the original Tomb Raider, but it is easily a much better film.  Basically, Cradle of Life is just a lot more fun than the first movie.  Since the audience doesn't have to be told exactly who Lara Croft is, director Jan de Bont can get right into the action immediately with a classic Lara Croft entrance.  Once the foot is on the pedal, there's no letting up on the gas until the very end, as this film is just packed with incredible action, one exotic locale after another, and - most importantly - Angelina Jolie.  Sure, the premise of the story (a real life Pandora's Box that contains the deadliest weapon known to man) is a little less than believable, but this is an action movie, not a PBS documentary.  There's also a surprising amount of depth to the character of Lara Croft in this movie, and that only adds to the film's strengths.

An earthquake off the coast of Greece leads Lara to the long-lost Lunar Temple of Alexander the Great and an artifact that points the way to Pandora's Box - which is suddenly something quite more than the stuff of mythology.  Ancient armies had been decimated by the mysteriously evil powers lurking within Pandora's Box, and it must be found before it falls into the wrong hands of the impeccably nasty Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), who plans to sell its secrets to as many terrorists as he can.  Unfortunately, the all-important clue falls into the hands of a notorious Chinese gang, and Lara - for once - needs help finding the club's secret hideout.  She asks for and gets Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a man who betrayed his country as well as Lara herself.  The dynamic duo make a most memorable entry into China, where more elaborate action scenes quickly ensue.  Lara's quest, however, will then take her to Hong Kong and, eventually, the heart of Africa where Pandora's Box reportedly lies.  As you might expect, some romantic tension arises between Lara and Sheridan along the way.  Even though we see more of the female side of Lara in this film, she knows what she has to do when the time comes.

This film boasts some amazing special effects and an almost endless supply of stunts (many of which Angelina did herself).  CGI is used in a couple of places, especially the final setting with its Guardian Shadows protecting the location of the box; these scenes lack realism, but the CGI effects themselves are quite good.  The DVD features a number of featurettes all about the making of the film, along with deleted/alternate scenes (including an alternate ending), a director's commentary, a superfluous screen test with Gerard Butler, and two music videos (and I would encourage Angelina fans to watch the Korn video).

I really don't know what else you could ask for in a summer box office action film.  Cradle of Life takes all of the components of the first film and improves upon them by leaps and bounds, goes out of its way to present stunts the viewer hasn't seen countless times before, adds depth to its main character, and features Angelina Jolie in all her glory.",1119744000,6,3117,4.6672760511883
1916756,3,B0000CABE6,"With tongue firmly in cheek, the story of this film is a series of

preposterous events, but what are we to expect of a game made into a

movie? Angelina Jolie is Lady Lara Croft, and is stunning in her skin

tight gray diving suit. Ciaran Hinds (Phantom Of The Opera) is the

villain, a scientist bent on getting his hands on the Pandora's box

containing the essence of all evil, in order to rule the world. Lara is

having none of that, and enlists her former partner Terry Sheridan

(Gerard Butler - The Phantom) to help find it and keep it away from

evil doers.

There are some wonderful set pieces throughout the film as with the

underwater temple; Lara arriving at the boat to start the expedition on

a jet ski (wowser!); the shark to the rescue (huh?); the sub to the

rescue (double huh?). More: at the Croft mansion the kung fu; the

sidesaddle horse riding while shooting at targets (wow!); at the prison

getting Terry released - her in her white fur amid all that filth;

Terry doing pull ups dripping sweat; Terry looking down from his bars

saying ""Croft"" in just the right way to let us know this is one

dangerous hombre. And his devastating comment to Lara ""I AM Charming""

and isn't he just? The motorcycle race between Lara and Terry across

the great wall in China was fun. Him telling her ""don't look at my ass""

as they climb a hill was cute and funny.

The famous sex scene is so reversed - she is the one in charge and he

ends up her prey and victim - is one for the books. Nice eye candy for

all of us out here in the real world.

That's the good stuff. There are some strange choices made by the

director (or whoever?) A wedding celebration on the edge of a precipice

to show the quake at the beginning? Lots of money for what purpose -

didn't add anything for me. The upside-down gunfight as Lara and Terry

escape once again. Sorry, the thrill is gone and it bombed.

Simon Chow is good and in his Hong Kong films a real menace - but here

was wasted. Croft running up the car shooting - a la Chow Yun Fat in

some of his 1980's films - is blatant 'borrowing.' All the shooting out

of glass in the office building - a la ""Die Hard"" - been there done

that.

AND!!! What is with the Shadow Guardians in the last fourth of film. We

go from sort of realism filtered through game playing mentality into

science fiction. Blech! Lame! Cinematography is gorgeous and some of

the sound track music is fine. Overall a more good than bad - 7/10",1115856000,5,2475,4.256465517241379
1916757,2,B0000CABE6,"All I can say is;why watch this when we can watch Indiana Jones?

The only good part in the entire movie is when the unseen people come out of the woodwork, other than that, I though the movie was a complete waste of my time and energy. Talk about chick flicks, this was definatly made just for a guys enjoyment. The entire movie revolved around Angelina Jolie and her body. The action stunk, she never got hurt except for one small slice on her leg, and can one really punch a shark in the nose and then ride on its back? I'm thinking not.

If action is your thing, and plots are not than this movie is completely for you.",1112745600,3,623,4.183333333333334
1916758,4,B0000CABE6,"First of all, Lawrence Bernarbo's review is excellent and nearly the last word on the film. Given that, here's a bit more. First, thanks very much for Jan de Bont for getting the Lara Croft idea back on track after Simon West's disastrous creation of the first Lara Croft, which was so bad that one critic referred to it as the first ""post-content"" movie. In fact, in one of those delicious ""living well is the best revenge"" moments, Jan de Bont (Speed, Twister) brought back Steven de Souza to write the story. In creating  the first Tomb Raider, West had rejected all three of de Souza's drafts. So, Paramount, can we please keep Steven de Souza now?

So what, exactly, is so much fun about a movie based on a video game? Well, first of all, of course, there's Jolie herself, who has created a truly great, mythic character. Okay, I admit, the mere words ""female archeologist"" would have hooked me to begin with, but when you turn the female archeologist into Wonder Woman, well, I'm just doomed to hopeless addiction. Second, it really is a very nice script, that obeys the most important rules of drama. There's a famous rule in drama that if there's a shotgun over the hearth in the first act, it must be fired by the end of the third. In this case, the shotgun is Lara's absolute certainty that ""Anything lost is meant to be found."" She is to discover, after much hardship and no small loss of life on all sides, that ""Some things are not meant to be found."" What she must do to make sure that some lost things are not found is what drives the deeper, more personal struggle.

As just about everyone has noted, Jolie was clearly born for this role. It can't be easy breathing life into a cartoon character, but she actually transcends the cartoonish aspects of Lara Croft and creates a living, breathing, slightly conflicted heroine. It helps that, unlike the Bond or Indiana Jones movies, we actually see the character practicing her skills. After all, don't you secretly wonder how Bond or Jones find the time to stay in shape? It's nice to see the hard work that goes into the famous fighting skills. In fact, in another gratifying moment, the mock battle with staffs at home is repeated for real in her battle with one of the lesser villains. Just one more shotgun over the fireplace.

Finally, Cradle of Life is just an amazingly pretty film, and that is partly what distinguishes it from its rivals. The sheer, ballet-like choreography of the stunts, from the famous dive off the skyscraper to sliding down the ropes upside down is so beautiful it leaves you with a wonderful feeling of, well, rightness. And it may be this consummate grace that gives the film its deeply feminine appeal. Lara Croft doesn't just fight on equal terms with men; she does so with a profoundly female grace of movement, which answers the question: ""What does it mean to be a female action hero?"" In this sense, Lara is more like Sarah Michelle Geller's Buffy than like the women of The Long Kiss Goodnight or the Kill Bill series.

In the end, the director, writers, cast and crew have created a truly satisfying action romp that sets new standards for female characters. They deserve our thanks for saving the Lara Croft myth from post-content hell. Thank you all.",1110758400,6,3257,4.618307426597582
1916759,4,B0000CABE6,"Following the first Lara Croft-based film in 2001, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"", Angelina Jolie resurrected her role as Lara Croft in the 2003 sequel ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"".  Written by Steven E. de Souza, James V. Hart and Dean Georgaris, this second film finds Lara Croft searching a Greek temple that had been lost for many centuries until an earthquake made its location known.  The temple had been created by Alexander the Great, but had been swallowed into the Aegean Sea during a much earlier earthquake.  Swimming down into the depths with two companions, Lara enters the temple, which is quickly giving way to the enormous pressure from the sea above, but discovers an unusual orb being held by a huge statue.  She quickly climbs up to get the orb, but others who also want the orb enter the tomb and are lead by a Chinese mafia leader, Chen Lo (Simon Yam).  Chen gets the orb from Lara, who barely manages to escape the underwater temple alive. The orb is an ancient map to finding Pandora's box and those who paid Chen to retrieve it, under the leadership of Jonathan Reiss (Ciarn Hinds), want to sell its deadly power to the highest bidders.  After being asked by British intelligence to locate the orb, Lara obtains assistance from an imprisoned mercenary named Terry Sheridan (Gerald Butler), who accompanies Lara to China in search of Chen and his Chinese mafia gang.  Though they locate the gang, Reiss gets the orb after several well-choreographed fisticuffs between Lara & Sheridan with Reiss's people and the Chinese gang.  However, Lara is finally successful in obtaining the orb from Reiss at his lab, which is located in a busy shopping center in Hong Kong.  With the secret to interpret the orb, Lara discovers the whereabouts of Pandora's box and sets off to retrieve it, but Reiss and his men are hot on her tail.

With a lot of fun choreographed fights and various special effects, ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" is an entertaining film and was certainly better than the first Lara Croft film in 2001.  Memorable scenes include the Greek temple, Lara's home in England, the trip to China, Hong Kong and the scenes in Africa.  Overall, I rate it with 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.

1916760,1,B0000CABE6,"Okay, okay, so I admit it - I rented this movie specifically to get a peek at Angelina Jolie in a few skimpy outfits. I knew it wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" going into it, but I really didn't know the meaning of pain until the movie started. And I didn't know the meaning of relief until I hit the eject button about 15 minutes later. This has to be the most ridiculous movie of the year. It's hard to believe that Jolie, a wonderful actress who gave us ""Gia"", ""Girl Interrupted"" and ""Hackers"" even agreed to read this script. I don't know how much she was paid to reprise her role as Lara Croft, but they'd have to have paid me at least a million to suffer through the screenplay much less the movie itself. There are two ways to do a movie with a ""pulp adventure"" feel. One is go the route of the Indiana Jones movies, where the dialogue is crisp, the script is smart, and even though the scenes somewhat defy physics, don't go too overboard. The second way is to go the Buckaroo Banzai route, in that the over the top characters exist in their own universe and that universe is consistent throughout. ""Lara Croft: The Cradle of Life"" does none of this. It's a bad James Bond movie. It's an even worse Indiana Jones movie, and it doesn't even come close to the sly wink of a Buckaroo Banzai movie. You know you are in trouble, when, in the first ten minutes, Croft, trapped underwater without her scuba gear, deliberately cuts herself to attract a great white shark, then, when said shark appears, punches it in the nose to teach it who's boss, then rides it to the surface. I got a sore throat and laryngytis from hollering ""You have got to be kidding me!"" at the screen so much. And that was after about 20 minutes. I can't even imagine the pain I'd have felt if I'd watched the entire movie.

The first movie had some tremendously fun action scenes while this one had one or two 'cool' parts and thats it. How many times can we really see Lara arrive or travel by skydiving/etc?

1916767,5,B0000CABE6,"This turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  More often than not film number two in an action series is somewhat lackluster.  But somehow director Jan de Bont managed to work some magic, take a good story, some novel stunts and special effects and decent acting and actually create something that is actually an improvement over the original.

Take a glowing orb that Alexander the Great has hidden in an underwater temple and make it the key to an ancient box full of the worst diseases imaginable.  Pit Lara Croft against a mad biologist who wants to unleash all of Pandora's ills on mankind.  There you have the basic plot, which ricochets from Greece to China and Africa - not counting stops at Lara's mansion.  Add people flying of the top of 1000 foot buildings, shooting upside down and joyriding sharks and you have the big picture.

This is all done quite well.  Yes, theres a lot of spectacle, but there is just enough understatement to it that the impossible almost seems likely rather than engaging one's disbelief.  In fact the only stunt I though was completely faked turned out to be totally real.  In addition Angelina Jolie and Gerald Butler turn in very credible performances.  Again, not enough for Academy Awards, but enough so that the characters develop some dimensionality.  Film work is also excellent, embedding the viewer right in the action. Jan de Bont has a very good eye for scene setting as well.

Some good added features are present on the DVD as well.  Jan de Bont's commentary and five good 'making of' features.  This is simply a fun film, and now that it's down in price, just the thing for the action addict.",1100304000,,1645,4.682926829268292
1916768,2,B0000CABE6,"(Warning: Spoilers ahead)

Why oh why did I go see this movie? I remember seeing the first Tomb Raider movie, and it was one of the most boring action films I had ever seen. Perhaps I was drunk (or under some sort of influence) at the time. Whatever the case, I went to see The Cradle of Life, and came out ready to go to sleep.

In Lara Croft's latest adventure, she tries to stop an arms manufacturer named Reiss from getting to Pandora's Box, which has the power to kill millions of people. To help her she enlists the aid of convict Terry Sheridan, and together they travel all the way from Hong Kong to Africa in search of Pandora's Box.

One of my gripes with this movie is that we seem to get too many pointless shots, which I am sure is supposed to wow us, but instead had my eyes rolling away from the screen due to lack of interest. For instance, one scene has Lara and Terry jumping off of a tall building in flying suits to escape some bad guys. It was cool for a very, very short time, but for some reason the camera kept focusing on them flying for what seemed like forever (okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration). It made me want to yell out ""I get the point! They're flying! Big deal!!!"" There was also another scene in which Lara parachutes into a moving jeep that was picking her up. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think it would be easier (and more logical) for the jeep's driver to stop, wait for her to land, then pick her up, but hey what do I know.

There is no doubt that Angelina Jolie looks great as Lara Croft in her many skin tight and revealing outfits. However, she often times seems to have no personality, as her facial expression does not change all that often. Also, we get no real insight into the character of Lara Croft herself, and what really makes her tick, but admittedly I don't think that there's much depth to Croft's character in the first place. The sad thing is that I know that Ms. Jolie can act, but it doesn't show in this movie. Is it the director's fault? The writers' fault? Who knows?

This movie also tries to work in some sort of relationship between Lara and Terry. But, as with much of this movie, it falls under the category of pointless plot device. The characters don't have any real motivation or need to be together, and in the end the ""affection"" between them seems way too forced and unnecessary.

One of the oddest things I noticed when watching this movie was that I did not get excited during the movie's action scenes. I would even say that some of these scenes (like the fight near the movie's start) were actually slow. Some people might attribute this feeling to me being spoiled by movies like the Matrix, but I very much doubt that considering I have seen many post-Matrix action movies that had cool action scenes (i.e. X-men 2, Terminator 3, and The Hulk).

So is there anything about The Cradle of Life that's any good. Well...there was this one scene in Africa where Lara was attacked by these weird monsters. That scene actually held my attention for some time. Also, as mentioned before, Angelina Jolie just looks great in this movie.

In conclusion, if for some reason you enjoyed the first Tomb Raider movie, than you will most likely enjoy this one. To everyone else who did not, there are better movies out there to spend your money on.",1092700800,5,3336,4.369354838709677

Jolie returns as the indefatigable Lara Croft, aided this time by Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Timeline), a former Marine turned mercenary/traitor.  Butler and Jolie have a fairly good comraderie, although it's definitely Jolie's move every way.  Ciaran Hinds (Road to Perdition, Sum of All Fears, Veronica Guerin) makes for a sturdy villain, all grimace and spit.  The movie revolves around the search for the mythical Pandora's Box; Hinds plays a viral bacteriologist who can release deadly viruses and he wants the box to let loose the contents of Pandora's box as the ultimate weapon.
Jan deBont (Speed) directs with a kinetic energy, and Alan Silvestri's score is impressive.

I thought Lara came off looking weaker in this film and I definately could have lived without that .. um .. somewhat indecent scene that really added nothing to the storyline on a whole. Lara just seemed a lot cooler in the first movie. I did buy the first movie but I don't think I'll buy this one.",1085270400,3,469,4.108695652173913

I suppose it does help that she has an equally sexy and adventurous boyfriend to help her out, although he wasn't always rooting for the good side.  The sequel packed more stunts and punch to its plot, but the first one gave her more grace.
Either way, Croft still dives right in to her adventures head first while the rest of us are left chattering and arguing away her amazing feats.  Maybe we're the ones missing out.",1085097600,4,625,4.4
1916777,2,B0000CABE6,"Angelina Jolie reprises her role as the adventuring hero Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, The Cradle of Life.  While the first movie was long on action and short on plot, they effectively do a 180 degree reversal in this sequel.
The plot involves the race between Lara and a dealer of WMDs (how convenient) to find the Cradle of Life where hidden is the literal Pandora's Box.  Opening the box will unleash a weapon far more powerful than anything man can create.  The dealer wants it to sell to the highest bidder and Lara wants it to keep it hidden.
Unfortunately much of the action of the first is lost, primarily due to the sub plot involving Lara and an old flame, a mercenary she rescues from prison to help her on the quest.  Not sure why they insist on giving Lara a love interest in every movie as it only serves to slow things down and kill the male fantasy.
More importantly, in both movies she's now found herself rescued by her male partner.  Isn't SHE supposed to be the hero here?  I think it really cheapens the character.
Anyway, the fact is Cradle of Life is just plain boring.  I found myself nodding off on a few occasions.  The Tomb Raider movies have been able to capture none of the fun and adventuring spirit of the video games, let alone Indiana Jones movies that they were modeled after.
You have exotic locales and secret tombs and such, but it all comes off very flat.  I think for the franchise to survive they really need a new director.",1084924800,,1461,4.401486988847584
1916778,1,B0000CABE6,"I saw this movie for free, as a friend of mine (for reasons I cannot fathom) bought it and loaned it to me, knowing that I am a huge fan of the Indiana Jones movies.  I can understand someone thinking that a similar film might appeal to me, but when that film is absolute crud ... well.  I knew that both this film and the one which preceded it (which I have mercifully not yet seen) were both based on video games, but this was not necessarily a bad thing: after all, ""The Pirates of the Carribean"" was based on an amusement park ride, and yet the movie was still very enjoyable (of course, that movie had some truly talented artists working behind it, such as Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp).  But perhaps that particular movie was an exception to the rule ... it's very possible that movies based on video games/rides/other sorts of not-exactly-literate entertainment generally aren't that great (but it would be nice if they were). But what exactly were my problems with this movie?  I've got a list of them, and here they are in no particular order:
The first complaint that comes to mind for this has to do with the music.  Though it wouldn't be so bad if we heard it just a time or two, the ""theme music"" for this movie, a sort of ""Lawrence of Arabia""-style sweeping orchestra piece, gets pretty danged irritating the fortieth or so time we hear it.
Second, there's Lara Croft's outfits.  They aren't practical adventuring gear ... they're obviously costumes.  That's the vibe I got right away, when first we saw her jetskiing in that skin-tight silver thing.  She's an archaeologist, not a model, for crying out loud!  Not only that, but Angelina Jolie, in spite of how well she pulled off the British accent, seemed totally phony and unbelievable in the role.  She was more an archetype than a real person ... a glamorous British adventurer simply going through the moves.  The character did nothing for me.
Third, the action and flow of the film struck me as nothing more than a series of incidents or set-pieces ... one cool action moment after another, repeated ad nauseum, from a hardly thrilling skydive to a motercyle ride on top of the Great Wall of China to a dozen more ... It's not exciting in the least, and only inspired for me eye-rolling tedium.  It made me wonder ""what's next"" as each scene went by, and not in a good way.
While the action was up to that point meant to be realistic, the whole climax of the film involving the tree creatures guarding the treasure of Pandora's Box, along with the Escher-style caves the box is kept in really came out of nowhere, inspiring the question ""what the heck is that all about"" rather then, ""wow, cool!"".  One thing I like now, I realize, about ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (which is quite possibly my all-time favorite movie, I should now mention) is that it gave us hints of the supernatural throughout the film, without actually throwing us into a situation where the supernatural was undeniably at work until the very end.  This movie, unfortunately, keeps us (tenuously, I admit) in the real world until the bit toward the end, and the change is quite jarring and feels totally artificial.
I really didn't care for ""Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life"", and so I really cannot recommend it.  If anyone out there can enjoy this, more power to them, I say, but I honestly believe that a healthy dose of Indiana Jones administered through a viewing of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" will immediately cure anyone of their desire to see this film again.  It saddens me to know that while another Indy film seems next to impossible to get off the ground, films like this are in the meantime somehow being released and making people like me always more aware of what the movie-viewing public is really missing out on.

1916779,3,B0000CABE6,"Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) returns in another action packed adventure. The action starts off in Santorini, Greece, where a lost city is discovered submerged under the sea. Lara gets her hands on a orb which will lead to the discovery of Pandora's Box. She is attacked by a Chinese group called the Shay Ling and loses the precious Orb. The Orb is a shining globe which when decoded will show the map of where Pandora's Box is hidden. Lara is enlisted by M16 to snatch back the Orb before it falls int o the wrong hands of the enemy who is intent on unleashing the evils withing Pandor'a Box. The adventure continues across the continents to China and then Africa.
I enjoyed the first film but felt that this particular film lacked the excitment of the first. Angelina does a good jobn with her English accent. Some of the ""horror"" scenes particularly through the jungle of woods in Africa were laughable and unbelievable but this is a fantasy film. Watch this film if you have nothing better to do.

1916780,4,B0000CABE6,"This movie was pretty good and did strike me as having a far better script than the first. The only thing I didn't like was the end. Anticlimatic and dull compared to the rest of the film, to say the least. I loved everything about the scene with the shadow demons.. then you get all hyped up to finally see the 'cradle of life' and.. it's a disappointment. Except for the lack of any sense of direction. This movie is fun and one of the better action films.
And I don't consider Angelina to be a sell out. She does what seems fun to her. Who cares if it is Oscar material or not. This looks like it must have been so much fun to make. Original Sin was also a great part and character for her. I would have enjoyed playing both parts. Academy Awards and prestige are not everything.",1082073600,,782,4.185430463576159
1916781,3,B0000CABE6,"The huge success of the Indiana Jones movies proves there's a market for good action/adventure films. So why put out something with the obvious weaknesses of THE CRADLE OF LIFE? Are the movie moguls just misreading their audience, or are they simply willing to settle for less? A really well done Lara Croft flik could be a blockbuster. Instead, we get stuff like THE CRADLE OF LIFE, wherein they rely on action to make up for the lack of a good story and they rely on sex appeal to cover for under-developed characters. It's disappointing.
The good news is that this Lara Croft movie is better than the first one. What story there is (and it's pretty flimsy) hangs together better, Jolie continues to look stunning, and the action sequences are fun, with some impressive stunt work. But action sequences are almost all there is. And fortunately, I was watching the DVD, not trying to follow it all in a theater. At times, the action comes so thick and fast that it's hard to tell exactly what happened without going back and watching it over frame by frame. I do feel they're improving, though, so if they keep making them, maybe they'll get it right eventually.
Lara Croft II isn't a terrible movie, it's just that it leaves a lot to be desired. A good action flik could be huge, but instead Hollywood is content to toss out a mediocrity. It was mildly enjoyable to watch once. Personally, I wouldn't buy it, though. It takes something more to be worth repeat performances.",1081900800,2,1475,4.633587786259542
1916782,5,B0000CABE6,"While most seem to be either a real big fan of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider movies or someone who despises them, I'll take up the role of a big fan. Just as in the first movie, Angelina Jolie's rendition of Lara Croft is absolutely wonderful. This second film, in what is undoubtedly going to be many, is another great action flick that is enjoyable entertainment from the beginning to the end.
While I only have a vague, passing familiarity with the video games, I can say, without a doubt, that this and the first movie make an enormously enjoyable leap from the pc screen to the silver screen.
Angelina Jolie's performance as Lara Croft, to include her impeccable British accent, is nothing less than stunning. I find it absolutely wonderful to see such a beautiful and agile actress take on the ""James Bond"" type role and handle it with such seeming ease. While these films won't win her any Oscars, they will indelibly mark her among the tops in action film stars. Gerard Butler's performance as Terry Sheridan makes another great performance by him after his leading role in ""Attila.""
Director, Jan de Bont deserves a great amount of praise for his direction of this box office smash, something of which he's quite familiar with having other directing credits to include ""Speed"" and ""Twister."" The score for this film greatly enhances the entire theatrical experience of the film.
The Premise:
Tomb Raider, Lara Croft finds herself on another mission to the save the world as she discovers an orb, which is the map to the Pandora's Box. Unfortunately for her, another tomb raider shows up when she discovers it and steals it from her, nearly killing her in the process. This other tomb raider happens to be working for Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) who happens to be the worlds leading manufacturer of biological weapons.
Lara is soon visited by the British secret service, MI-6 and she finds herself on a mission to save the world, sanctioned by the Queen herself. All she needs now is a little help from an old ""friend"" in Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), who happens to be a former SAS Major, turned mercenary and who is now stuck in a Russian prison. The British government agrees to secure his freedom to help her.
What follows from there is nothing less than another outstanding Lara Croft Tomb Raider action film that is highly enjoyable and I most certainly look forward to future endeavors in this film series. {ssintrepid}

1916783,2,B0000CABE6,"I hate the plot - it's poorly executed & doesn't hang together well enough.  I also found her butler & geek friend to look too different from the previous movie to actually work - they feel like completely different characters.  Overall I also found Lara to be kind of unattractive in this movie (either too chunky or too arrogant looking at all the wrong times).
On the upside I do like the relationship between her & her jail gent - it really works, and feels good (even the ending).  I also like the realistic & semi-realistic toys (although they do date the movie).

1916784,4,B0000CABE6,"""Tomb Raider:  The Cradle of Life"" marks the return of Angelina Jolie to the big screen as video game icon Lara Croft the Tomb Raider for more globetrotting treasure hunting [is a classic] adventure.
THE STORY:
After the mysterious globe she pursued gets stolen out from under her grasp, Lara Croft embarks on a mission to avenge her loss and protect the all powerful Pandora's Box that the globe leads to from falling into the wrong hands.
THE COOL THINGS:
If you've followed the video games or the first film you'll be pleased with this sequel.  All the cool special FX and action sequences you enjoyed in the first movie and in the video game series returns here for Cradle of Life.  The adrenaline is pumped further as Lara Croft gains a partner in the form of a jacked up Aussie ex-con, Terry Sheridan, whom she enlists to help her track down the Chinese syndicate who stole her globe.  Like in the first film we get a whirlwind tour of the world as Lara traces down Pandora's Box and The Cradle of Life from China to Africa and everywhere in between.  The thing I think that separates this movie from the first one is that the story in ""Cradle of Life"" was stronger and better developed than the first one.
BEST SCENES:
1. The Underwater Temple
2. Fighting the Chinese Syndicate
3. The ""Sky-Flying"" Scene
4. The Monsters in Africa
5. Battle for Pandora's Box in the Cradle of Life

1916785,2,B0000CABE6,"I could swallow a review calling this movie the best action film since DIE HARD or SPEED (ah, Jan De Bonts fluke---a great film) before I can swallow another calling it better than the original. REGARDLESS of what you think either film, I don't see how this can be considered better than the first.
Okay, the filmmakers DID acknowledge that the first film had little in the way of character developement or drama. Thats better than this film, which has human drama, BAD human drama. BAD! The plot involving Lara and the-guy-whose-name-I-dont-care-to-remember was suffocating. Former lovers with sexual undercurrents throughout their adventures??? YAWN? How about the whole let-the-criminal-out-of-prison-to-hunt-the-bad-guy thing? Yeah..... AGAIN!
Speaking of bad guys, Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life has a pathetic one. It takes serious acting talent to pull off the a prim and proper British bad guy (in other words, a complete pansy), something that this man doesn't have. At least movies like UNDERWORLD, XXX, and BAD BOYS II had the decency to give us bad guys with long, greasy hair and unshaven mugs to give them some credibility.
 Not even a shark can save this film. Usually, when in doubt and the setting involves the ocean, you can throw in a shark attack to spice things up, like in the Bond films. This time we have a pathetic CG tiger shark that easily be punched in the face to be stopped. I realize that the shark's nose is a sensitive area, but what Lara does is impossible in the physical universe.
Not exciting, not stylish, DEFINATELY not compelling, and not funny, this film is far from the first, but in the opposite direction that most think. Simon West might not know diddly about human drama, but at least he acknowleged this and instead focused on what he was good at: action and style. Better than this pretentious mess of cliches and banality.",1078012800,9,1882,4.899686520376176
1916786,2,B0000CABE6,"The only reason I hope this film gets positive reviews anywhere is so that another is made with a better director.
I might be alone in that I believe that the first film was better than the second.  Basically--my opinion is based solely on the action scenes.  I wanted more from the dialogue and more scenes with her housemates as well though.
The intro for the first was more explosive.
The bungee cord melee in the mansion that leads into the garage was much more fun to watch than any of the riding on the Great Wall or the rapelling face first down a cliff.
Then you have the entire scene in the hall with the statues that come to life, where Lara is shooting and sword--fighting.
Maybe I need to see this film on DVD but Cradle of Life had too few scenes where Lara could have unloaded her arsenal of cool moves---but didn't.
I did like the notion of the play between her and Clive Owen.  For her character it was a nice subplot to see lara's emotional side---(basically to see who she is without being a hardcore ass-kicking superstar).
I'll never miss a chance to watch Angelina Jolie on the big screen, or in the role of Lara Croft,  basically I'm hoping a third film is the perfect blend of the action from the first with the scenery from the second.

1916787,1,B0000CABE6,"This film, like the first, was so bad I only watched it because it came on cable free and there was literally nothing else on and I had the flu. I'm reviewing it so I can crank the overall rating down a bit - I respect those whose opinions differ from mine on the film, but I'd feel terrible is some sucker actually read the reviews and thought ""gee, sounds good - I'll buy it"" based on them. Here's my kick to the rating.

Angelina Jolie, who can act when she chooses to, goes through all the motions. A film this silly shouldn't take itself too seriously, and this one tries not to, but the cliches are huge and the wit nonexistant. Even the set-pieces got boring. Films made from video games suffer no matter what, but this was just sad.

Lara Croft has a great backstory vis-a-vis the game. The studio could have made a great ""female Raiders"" film, and instead they came out with a spandex-wearing, emotionless, witless goofball who fights James-Bond-ish cartoon baddies. Her hijinks with the baddies and her support staff staff made the original Batman and Robin (""WHAM!"") look slick - at least they had camp. This film is a soulless excercise in licensing.

Save the money. Borrow a friends copy on a slow TV night and take NyQuil before viewing. You won't be able to pay attention for long before the drugs kick in, but that's ok.",1076198400,5,1337,4.493827160493828
1916788,3,B0000CABE6,"Well, whaddya know? A sequel that outstrips the original in absolutely every area! They do exist, after all.
Mind you, since the original movie was such a terrible shambles, that's not so difficult to imagine.
Anyway, to synopsise the plot, Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is a chemical weapons developer in search of pandora's Box, which he believes to contain the ultimate plague. Enter Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), treasure-hunter extraordinaire, to stop Reiss and save the world from destruction. Aided in her quest by one-time lover Terry Sheridan (Gerry Butler), her travels take her across the globe and back, from Greece to England, China to Africa, and there's a whole host of enemies to be defeated and puzzles to be solved in the interim.
The first thing one notices about 'Tomb raider' is Jolie's nigh-on flawless accent, and, for fans of the videogame, she's the perfect embodiment of Lara Croft. She does a credible job as a sort of modern female Indiana jones, and her supporting cast are passable, with the exception of Butler as Terry Sheridan, a charismatic actor with oceans of screen presence. Together this pairing works well.
The direction (by the normally excellent Jan De Bont) is pretty standard, with some bizarre slow-mo sequences cheapening the effect of the gorgeous locations. The titular 'Cradle of Life' looks somewhat rushed and in places the special effects look amateurish. But for the most part the action scenes are shot well, and there are dozens of nods to the videogames.
An average action flick, and one which, despite its flaws, is very entertaining, 'Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life' is a decent enough flick, far better than the original, which does a decent enough job of keeping you entertained. Just don't expect Indiana Jones and you'll most likely enjoy it.

1916789,4,B0000CABE6,"I viewed the first tomb raider movie to be just another piece of video-game-gone-hollywood crap. So I never bothered seeing it. I wouldn't have bothered seeing the second one either, if it wasn't that I was bored and nothing else good was on PPV. While my prejudices to Lara's incarnation on-screen weren't completely wrong, I did end up finding Cradle of Life to be a very enjoyable, all-be-it commercialized, movie.
Cradle of life has the sexy Angelina Jolie returning as the hottest broad to ever grace a video game console - Lara Croft. Lara on the big screen is even more amazing than her character in the games, as she comes off as some sort of genetic splicing of a Master Ninja, Indiana Jones, and a Navy Seal. While not quite believable and a little over-done, it works well in context of the movie.
Lara reunites with an old ex, to go after the real life Pandora's Box, which is supposed to contain not only the secrets of the universe, but some really bad juju to say the least. While the plot attempts to explain the box and it's  contents as a sort of plague (thus a bioweapons dealer is also looking for it) it also encorperates supernatural/meta physical sorts of things such as the shadow creatures gaurding it. This confused me a bit, but didn't detract too much as I wasn't expecting an ingenious plot here to begin with.
The acting is generally good, although I may have just been distracted by Jolies hypnotic eyes which always seem to have that ""I want to rip your clothes off"" look on them. No doubt Lara is pleasing to look at, but her portrayal in the movie gives an likable quality, something like a female james bond (she also has lots of gadgets so...)
The action in Cradle of Life is pretty intense and there's no shortage of over the top fight scenes and abundant special effects as is oh so typical of modern mainstream action films. While no one part of this movie is all that good, none are outright terrible either. The style of the film is something like what you might expect if the Iniana Jones series and Mission Impossible 2 had children together. The whole package adds up to be a decent movie, that while it will hopefully never win an oscar, it was a pretty good time to watch... once.",1076112000,,2226,4.50990099009901

Alexander used the temple to store many of his treasures from his vast conquests, but now it is hundreds of feet under water.  Upon locating the Luna Temple, Lara finds an unusual orb.  Immediately, the orb is stolen from her by a gang of Chinese black market thieves who followed her to the location.  MI-6 (British CIA) contracts Lara to retrieve the orb before it falls into the hands of an international bio-terrorist who wants to use the orb as a map to locate the cradle of life which houses the mystical pandora's box.  The box possesses the most deadly of viruses that can kill millions instantly.  With the aid of an old boyfriend Lara sneaks into China to steal the orb.  Along with her staff she decodes the orb's secret to finding the location of the cradle of life.  This film has many daredevil type stunts that anyone can appreciate.

This second installment in the series (and I do hope this is a series) is absolutely fantastic.  Think Indiana Jones and James Bond wrapped into a believable heroine expertly played by Angelina and terrific cast, effects, writing, and music.  This movie met and exceeded every expectation and I tend to think is under-appreciated among the critics.  We've enjoyed it and have watched many times over.  Can't say that about all movies these days.  Gerrard is excellent in his role.  My only complaint is the ending, but I won't give that away.  Not a bad ending, but would have preferred a certain character not be, well, eliminated.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed.  I am eager for the next!",1073692800,,819,4.74468085106383

1916796,5,B0000CABE6,"After seeing the first ""Tomb Raider"" film, I craving for more excitement. When I saw the second ""Tomb Raider"" film in theaters, my craving had been fulfilled. What more can you say about a film that has lots of action, lots of exotic locations, and lots of sexiness from Angelina Jolie? Just read below:
""Tomb Raider 2"" by far had lots of action--about as much as the first film--that kept me on the edge of my seat. The Terra-cotta warriors sequence was absolutely amazing and I especially enjoyed the sequence in the laboratory and high-jump from the Hong Kong building! These sequences also gave me an appreciation for the hard work the filmmakers and cast put into to bring moviegoers pleasing, yet exciting entertainment. The action recieves a rating of 10/10.
The exotic locations in the film are very eye-appealing, especially the underwater temple sequence, which is by far the most amazing set that I've seen in films (especially when combined with lots of rushing water)! I was also espeicially pleased with the Hong Kong setting because I felt that Hong Kong was perfect for many of the action sequences in the film! However, I wished that they had did a sequence involving a submarine battle between Lara Croft and the bad guys, but for now I was very pleased in what was presented to me. The exotic locations recieve a rating of 10/10.
And finally, I believe that the sexiness from Angelina Jolie turned up a notch in this film for it seemed that Angelina Jolie became the character that most fans of the video game have come to known--and love--about Lara Croft. I was also pleased in how Mrs. Jolie didn't seem to show any boredom with her character, and how she had made perfect chemistry with Bryce and the butler (the use of her witty remarks, especially the line ""tea is for guests, the door is for intruders""). The sexiness from Angelina Jolie---hands down--wins my rating of 10/10.
Now I know many critics gave this movie some bad reviews, but I believed that this movie brought more excitement than what was published in the newspapers by the critics. If one really wants to feel the excitement of lots of action, lots of exotic locations, and lots of sexiness from Angelina Jolie, then I suggest checking out this film! I guarantee if you watch it for awhile and appreciate it, it'll be a movie that will surely be an excellent addition to the DVD/VHS collection!",1073433600,2,2386,4.724220623501199
1916797,4,B0000CABE6,"I was trying to rent the Tomb Raider One dvd from Blockbuster before going to see the second Lara Croft.
But no luck, all Tomb Raider rental were all out for the weekend, and eventually, I just cann't wait. Saw it on Saturday at Coliseum. My impression for the first Lara Croft movie wasn't that big hit. So I didn't bring much expectation into the threater for Croft 2. Surprisely, it's a pretty good movie, very exciting all the way to the ending. No boring nor 'talking-too-much' scenes. The plot is good, fighting is fabulous, sound effect is incredible! Only a small tiny disappointment was the character played by Simon Yam didn't last long. Overall, highly recommended. Definitely good fun for 2 hours.",1073347200,9,709,4.772357723577236
1916798,1,B0000CABE6,"You know, I can take a lot of crap. I can look at a flawed movie, scrape away the muck and find entertainment (hell, I even loved Waterworld!). I can usually find a piece of what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. Jan De Bont's directorial career has required A LOT of that from me. Which I don't mind. I'm happy to do a bit of the leg work to be entertained. I loved Speed. Ignored the characters and had a blast with Speed 2. Jumped over the plot holes and got caught up in the chase with Twister. I was with The Haunting right up until before the end. But, with Tomb Raider 2 (I'm not spelling out the entire title, that would take too long. Actually, in the time it takes me to type this, I could have written out the title several times over. Oh well), I lost my patience altogether.
Sitting in the cinema, I grew very angry. If I had C4 strapped to my chest, that cinema would have had a Red Alert situation on their hands (kidding, Mr. FBI. Loosen up, dude).
I loved the original. I saw it was flawed, but how can you not have fun in that flick (providing you neatly fall into that demographic)? A very charismatic and sexy lead actress. Spectacular action set pieces. Two big guns and the boobs to match. The perfect formula. How do you drop the ball on that one?!
Enter De Bont. If there was anything wrong with the first one, it was too much spiritual and relationship crap. So, what do they do here, take out the action and add MORE spiritual and relationship crap. And the action that is there, lets slow it down, so nobody can possibly get any kind of excitement from it.
For me, this movie had NO redeeming features. That opening shark fight was the epitome of RIDUCULOUS. Why did she have to cut herself agian to get the sharks attention? What, the massive stab wound in her leg wasn't enough? And why did it kindly escort her to the surface? Why didn't other sharks get attracted to the blood and finish her off in the THREE DAYS she was marooned, feet dangling in the water? Come on!!
The much publicized bike ride on the Great Wall of China was NOTHING. She's not being chased. There's no danger. It lasts only 5 seconds. When will these hack directors learn, a stunt man doing an incredible stunt (or in this case CG), does not a great action scene make. Put a guy behind her with an automatic weapon (which would have fitted into the ""story"") for God's sake.
Countless times this movie let me down on the action side. The parachute jump that was filmed in one shot from fifty freaking miles off so there is no way we could get a feel of the rush those guys must of had. TERRIBLE!
Jan appears to be the kind of guy who gets a hard on for parachutes opening. The amount of time spent watching parachutes open in this movie could perhaps have been better spent extending some of the fights. Why does the boring parachute jump and a trek through Africa get extended screen time and the only potentially good action sequences get reduced to mere seconds?! UNFORGIVABLE.
But it's not just the big things that make this movie retch-worthy. This is the kind of B-grade bad flick that EVERY SINGLE TIME a boat passes across the screen, it sounds it's horn. When traveling through Africa, bring out the stock footage of EVERY SINGLE SPECIES on the continent. Not one shot is without some kind of wildlife.
And why hasn't De Bont learnt that CG just isn't scary?! (save for Shelob) BOO!!
And drop the coutries!! Too many! That time could hev been spent on a decent action scene!
The more I think of this movie, the more I hate it! HATE IT!!!
The only two good things in this movie should have been Angelina's breasts (but even the exposition on those is virtually non-existent). However, it is a kid in the elevator and SpoungeBob Squarepants. $130 million dollar budget and the best things in it have a height restriction??!!
What the producers of this show need to keep foremost in their attention, is this one simple, yet gravely important fact - IT'S BASED ON A VIDEO GAME!!! You're not trying to adapt a Jane Austin bestseller here! You're priorities are all wrong!
So the first one got crapped on by every critic under the sun. So what? The ones who count (core audience) liked it. They're the ones whose money you want. So when a sequel comes around, why listen to the ones who don't even pay for their movie ticket and chuck in all that [gag] depth, totally alienating your target audience, and causing your company to lose a heap of dough. Oh, but the critics liked it better! Success!!

I give this movie 5 stars and this DVD 5 stars also because the bonus material is GREAT! It gives detailed information on the making of the movie including Angelina's training that includes weapons and hand to hand combat. It is clear, this movie has transformed Angelina Jolie into a real life Lara Croft and she can pretty much kick anybody's butt. And she really looked like she enjoyed making this movie and it was a lot of fun for her and that translated onto the screen. She feels very comfortable in her role as Lady Croft. The character seems to have been made for her. It's a pity so many people don't see how wonderful the Tomb Raider movies are. They just don't make these type of adventure movies anymore. 'The Matrix' movies were all way over done and took themselves too seriously and ultimately lead to the biggest let down in movie history. Tomb Raider is what it is. A fun, action packed adventure movie. You don't have to leave the theater trying to figure out what you just saw. It's only meant to entertain and, for me, it did. I wish they'd make 10 more Tomb Raider movies.",1072569600,,1206,4.536697247706422

The movie moves along at a reasonable clip with few really slow bits and is supported by good cinematography and an excellent soundtrack.  I actually thought this movie was a bit tighter plotwise and less corny that the first movie.
In the case of the DVD there is a fair amount of information regarding the creative process of making the movie including the obligatory sections on stunts, special effects and scoring.  What I thought was a bit missing was some of the design materials that would talk about how the look and feel of the movie came from.

Lowpoints: Script falters at times; predictable.
Conclusion: Ask me why critics HATED the `Tomb Raider' sequel, and I'll honestly retort `beats me'. Although `Lara Croft: Tomb Raider II. The Cradle of Life' isn't a masterpiece by any standards (you'd be better off re-watching Indiana Jones' adventures), it still is better than its predecessor, and is worth the admission price; if you have kids, buy the DVD. The film boasts an ambitious female hero (Jolie ROCKS!), awe-inspiring stunts (people fly!), hot settings (England! China! Africa!) and an involving plot, including frightening creatures that leap at everything that moves, and a wonderful underwater shark-fighting sequence. Despite simple dialogue, a predictable narration and uneven editing, `Cradle...' offers a harmlessly adventurous yarn, and by `harmless' I mean it is not racist, feminist, or discriminatory in any other ways, which is a blessing, with the likes of `Rush Hour 2', `Bulletproof Monk' and `2 Fast 2 Furious' stretching their forced PG-13 rating with dim-witted insults. Those movies' inanity is an insult by itself - the only insult Jan De Bont's audacious, enthused sequel presents to the viewer is the prospect of recollecting its ridiculously lengthy title.",1071360000,,1351,5.693069306930693
1916806,2,B0000CABE6,"This film was the most dissapointing film of the summer. It wasn't the worst, but it was just a waste of everyone's valuable time. Where to start. Lara croft,is played by Angelina Jolie. She's beautiful but this role hasn't spread her range as an actress. The video game based sequel has Croft in search of an ancient artifact called Pandora's Box, ""The most powerful thing ever imagined."" I'm getting tired of the same old plot of an ancient artifact being searched for. Why can the plot be about how the audience can give a damn about this film. The visuals are nice, but there so boring and repitive that i almost fell asleep. The ending is boring as well. At least this film is better than the original. But not by much. I'll just rather play the new ""Tomb Raider"" game that came out this year. Oh yeah that sucks too.",1071187200,6,822,4.450331125827814
1916807,3,B0000CABE6,"The second (and hopefully the last) in the film versions of the Tomb Raider computer game is decidedly better than the first.  It achieves this primarily by not being as ridiculous in spots as the first one was.  This particular film has the oddity of starting off as a story about a female Indiana Jones but ends up being vastly more like a female James Bond.  One of the things I liked about the Tomb Raider computer games was the rather primitive feel to the games:  caves, caverns, jungles, rivers, cliffs, ancient ruins.  But this second film is stuffed primarily with high tech gadgets and gizmos.  The story is pretty uninteresting, but I'm sure no one was really expecting much in the way of plot.
I really, really like Angelina Jolie, but I have to say that at this point she just hasn't hit her stride as an actress.  I don't know if it is that she isn't being offered first-rate scripts or if she or her agent is making some abysmal choices about which films to make.  She is a good actress, with an absolutely gorgeous, unforgettable face, and she should have been able to craft a better career at this point than she has.  She rightly won her Oscar for GIRL INTERRUPTED, but her films since then have been more or less a string of disappointments.  Her next couple of films are unlikely to right the boat.  I am always extremely sceptical about historical biopics to revive someone's career as a serious actor, so I am leery of what ALEXANDER (with Angelina playing Olympias) and LOVE AND HONOR (with Angelina as Catherine the Great) will mean for her career.  She mainly is playing in uninteresting projects, but all indications are that she is a smart, serious woman with some substantive concerns about the world.  So why so many lame projects?  My lone hope is that all of these projects will make lots of money, and make her one of the first actresses that people think of when they have a hot script.  And then I hope that she will make those pictures instead of more TOMB RAIDERs.",1070841600,,2000,4.532033426183844
1916808,5,B0000CABE6,"While most seem to be either a real big fan of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider movies or someone who despises them, I'll take up the role of a big fan.  Just as in the first movie, Angelina Jolie's rendition of Lara Croft is absolutely wonderful.  This second film, in what is undoubtedly going to be many, is another great action flick that is enjoyable entertainment from the beginning to the end.
While I only have a vague, passing familiarity with the video games, I can say, without a doubt, that this and the first movie make an enormously enjoyable leap from the pc screen to the silver screen.
Angelina Jolie's performance as Lara Croft, to include her impeccable British accent, is nothing less than stunning.  I find it absolutely wonderful to see such a beautiful and agile actress take on the ""James Bond"" type role and handle it with such seeming ease.  While these films won't win her any Oscars, they will indelibly mark her among the tops in action film stars.  Gerard Butler's performance as Terry Sheridan makes another great performance by him after his leading role in ""Attila.""
Director, Jan de Bont deserves a great amount of praise for his direction of this box office smash, something of which he's quite familiar with having other directing credits to include ""Speed"" and ""Twister.""  The score for this film greatly enhances the entire theatrical experience of the film.
The Premise:
Tomb Raider, Lara Croft finds herself on another mission to the save the world as she discovers an orb, which is the map to the Pandora's Box.  Unfortunately for her, another tomb raider shows up when she discovers it and steals it from her, nearly killing her in the process.  This other tomb raider happens to be working for Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) who happens to be the worlds leading manufacturer of biological weapons.
Lara is soon visited by the British secret service, MI-6 and she finds herself on a mission to save the world, sanctioned by the Queen herself.  All she needs now is a little help from an old ""friend"" in Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), who happens to be a former SAS Major, turned mercenary and who is now stuck in a Russian prison.  The British government agrees to secure his freedom to help her.
What follows from there is nothing less than another outstanding Lara Croft Tomb Raider action film that is highly enjoyable and I most certainly look forward to future endeavors in this film series.  {ssintrepid}

1916809,4,B0000CABE6,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life is a rare sequel that is better than the ones that came before it.  In the sequel, Lara must find Pandora's Box using a orb that will direct her where to go.  All that it known about its whereabouts is that it is somewhere in the Cradle of Life, where mankind began.  As well, this isn't the Pandora's Box of Greek mythology, but instead something that will unleash a weapon that could wipe out humanity if found.  Also interested in finding it is a biological weapons expert/salesman who sees the possibilities it possesses.  This is an action-packed movie that never slows down from beginning to end.  That is the strength of the movie overall although there is some semblance of a real plot here.  This is an enjoyable movie that will keep you interested throughout.
  Once again, Angelina Jolie reprises the role of globe-trotting adventurer Lara Croft.  Besides being incredibly gorgeous in the role, she is very believable as she performs many of her own stunts.  Gerard Butler plays Terry Anderson, an ex-Royal Marine gone bad who must now work with Lara to retrieve Pandora's Box.  Ciaran Hinds is good as the villain also trying to retrieve the box.  Djimon Hunsou is also very good in a small role.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, 6 deleted scenes, an alternate ending, director commentary, five featurettes about the movie, and two music videos.  This is by no means a great movie, but it is at least worth a watch if for nothing else than to see Angelina Jolie.  For an exciting movie that never slows down from beginning to end, check out Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.",1070582400,6,1647,4.706293706293707
1916810,4,B0000CABE6,"Angelina Jolie is terrific as Lara Croft, a video game character brought to life. I thought she was very good in the first Tomb Raider, and now she's even better. Her physical look, her movement (and that of the stunt crew), her voice, her humour and her darkness are all that they should be, and it's frankly an amazing performance. Gerard Butler, as Croft's ex Terry Sheridan, was also very good, and added some nice complexity to the plot. I also thought the CGI at the end was well done, with some horrifying monsters.  There is a very stylish quality to the film, reminiscent of computer games but not too much so, except perhaps at the very end.
It's just too bad that the script wasn't better, the plot a bit less silly, and the action choreographed better. Okay, I know I'm asking for a lot for a movie based on a video game.  Even  Raiders of the Lost Ark had its weak moments--remember when Indiana Jones climbed aboard a Nazi submarine and it sailed halfway around the world either without submerging, or even less likely, without anyone noticing a new crewmember? Improvement has occurred from the completely nonsensical plot of Tomb Raider I, but there's still room to go.  What is it with characters who routinely deal with devices obviously magical, but who can't get it through their thick skulls that releasing ""anti-life"" just might be bad for them, too?
And Tomb Raider II needed a real villain. We got a lot of bad guys, but nobody who really brought it off.  Even though they planned to release a plague that could destroy all life on Earth, the bad guys never seemed truly terrifying.  The Chinese bad guys were practically ludicrous--and why is it that in Hollywood films, Western guys and gals always beat the Chinese at martial arts, their own game?
Finally, in an action movie, the action needs to work a bit better. The helicopter scene was actually quite poor, and I expect I could put my finger on the moment when the stunt double was used. Still, I have hopes for the franchise. Wouldn't a smart, ironic Tomb Raider III be something to see?",1070323200,,2070,4.611413043478261
1916811,4,B0000CABE6,"Guys get your towels cause Angelina Jolie is @ it again and looks HOT as ever. Within the first fifteen minutes or so u get to see Lara Croft in a hot, silver, skin-tight scuba diving suit! But her sexuality is pretty much a given these days, so besides that this empowering character gives us two hours of an exhilarating, multi-continental water ride.  Much like the first, Lara discovers a coveted archeological find, it is taken from her, and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get it back. In this flick the stakes are higher, the super-villain even more heinous, and she's got more new gadgets and tricks up her sleeve.
  Buried in an ancient underwater temple, a melon sized amber orb glows. Which when activated is a map to find the Cradle of Life, the home to the legendary Pandora's box. An evil scientist hires a Chinese gang of international thieves to pull off the caper. Now these thieves are so ferocious they have to keep a secret lair.
  Lara seeks out the aid of a Scottish inmate Terry (Gerard Butler) to aid her in the finding of the orb. A past relationship between the two is unfurled and serves as unnecessary tension on the already intricate plot. Nevertheless his presence is needed to find the gang and in a few close calls between Lara and her enemies.
 Croft manages to fiddle w/ gadgets and weaponry like the great 007, while swinging effortlessly between anything ranging between falling rocks or buildings. And sliding upside down on a rope as she shoots her way past her enemies is reminiscent of a neo Indiana Jones.... Now I have no problem with an adrenaline junk-ette charged with enough estrogen to turn George into Gina and I think she's the perfect woman for such a hard job.
  Croft has definitely stepped it up a notch for this tomb-raiding sequel and appropriately given even more exciting scenes and battles. From shark riding to sailing in a flying squirrel suit she does it all! Vicariously, us chicks get to feel like we kicked a little butt but not to leave out the guys because there's enough action to go around a theater.

Angelina Jolie in a tight silver jumpsuit reminded me so much of Halle Berrie jumping around in an orange 70s style bikini suit in the latest James Bond flick.  And then there are the gadgets...guns...cars....motorcycles...etc.  It feels like the producers of the movie can't decide whether to make Lara Croft into another Indy...or maybe a cross between Indy and James Bond.  Still, I think this movie's story was better than the first one....that's the reason for the extra star.  The pandora's box scenerio is very timely considering what kind of world we are living in today.  The action in this movie is much more engrossing than the first also.

Just like the first one, it's not a great movie but the sexy Jolie and the action make it a good pop-corn movie at least. Jan de Bont the director of Speed and Twister gives us action all over the place. It's hard to keep up with it all but I still found it all pretty entertaining. Gerard Butler (Timeline, Dracula 2000, Reighn of Fire) makes a good partner for Jolie. The fact that she doesn't know if she can trust him makes for a good sub-plot. Although the action is fun, the artifacts that the movies have Croft go after are silly. I mean I can't even tell you what the Cradle of Life is and why the bad guys even want it. At least in Raiders of the Lost Ark you know the bad guys just want to discover the secrets of the Ark. The villains in the Lara Croft movies are bad imitations of villains you'd see in a James Bond movie.

1916815,2,B0000CABE6,"While I can see some people's liking this sequel, I absolutely did not. Conversely, I rather liked the original, while many people did not. ""The Cradle of Life"" is more linear, but, to me, it lacks the verve of the first in the series. Both movies are silly and cartoonish. The original, though, had three great set pieces - Lara's manor house in England, an amazing temple in Thailand, and another incredible temple in the Arctic. It was rather like a play in three acts, anchored by these amazing, computer-generated sets. It satisfied both as `eye candy' and as a `popcorn' movie. The sequel has only one main set piece - African mountain that holds the key to the movie, which is Pandora's Box. This setting is rather lame. It looks like a 1980s New York disco.
In the original, Lara does what she does to avenge the death of her father. In the sequel, she comes of as nothing more than an archeological plunderer who cares only for the prize, not for the consequences of that prize.
As in the first film, Angelina Jolie is superb as Croft. She is the female equivalent of Michael Keaton as Batman or Tobey Maguire as Spiderman. The movie's failings are in no way hers.",1069977600,3,1173,4.537735849056604

1916819,1,B0000CABE6,"I had not thought it possible that a film might equal or surpass ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" in terms of sheer rancid awfulness, but I was wrong. Along came the ""Tomb Raider"" sequel.
Hold up your hand if you were able to follow the ""story"" of this movie all the way through, from beginning to end. Hold up your hand if you thought the story made the slightest bit of sense. Hold up your hand if you cared one iota about anything that happened in this movie. Hold up your hand if you remembered the plot of this movie after the final special effect had mercifully ended. Not many takers out there, I see.
Face it, we watch these movies for Angelina Jolie, those lips, those eyes, that body. ""Tomb Raider 2"" (I forget the ridiculous title) doesn't even satisfy on that lowliest of levels: juvenile erotic interest. Jolie was so robotically monotonous in this movie that Lara could easily have been played by a software program. Since this movie feels written and directed by a software program, that would have made a whole lot more sense.
I just cannot complain more vocally about CGI in movies these days. Filmmakers just ignore the need for a good script, filling screentime instead with digital effects that nobody really cares anything about. The climactic sequence of this film, in which Ciaran Hinds (a truly interesting actor) is terrorized by CG-animated monsters, is unbelievably, obscenely boring; I could feel my own life force trickling out.
I write this review as a warning to others. ""Tomb Raider 2"" is pure Hollywood crap. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Rent ""Holes"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" instead. Please.",1069545600,9,1636,4.804964539007092

1916821,5,B0000CABE6,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle to Life was just as great as its predecessor, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. That aspect totally blew me away because as the case with most sequels, they usually aren't as good as the first. This one was just as good, if not that, better! It had the perfect balance of romance and action w/ just the right amount of dry humor to lighten up the story.
The action scenes didn't look fake or computerized at all, and Lara's ability to kick-butt didn't look newly learned.
Angelina Jolie is a superb actress and in this particular movie she absolutley out-did herself, playing a tough-girl tomb raider, out to save the world. Her love attraction, Terry, played by Gerard Butler was absolutley perfect for the part. A bit rough-around the edges but still intriguing, he is perfect for the part! Together they are magnificent.

1916823,4,B0000CABE6,"It would be easy to dismiss ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" as being a cross being ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and a James Bond movie except for two things.  The first is that there is nothing inherently wrong with combining those two elements, even if the genesis of your character is a series of video games.  The second is that despite the overwhelming plot similarities between this second Lara Croft film and the first and third Indiana Jones movies, there are actually things going to with the titular character.  We are not talking profound psychological development here, but for an action film there is actually something else going on as well.
The main thing, of course, is the action, which is why the James Bond comparisons are so obvious.  An earthquake shakes the Greek island of Santorini and the next thing we know Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is on the trail of Pandora's Box.  Apparently it was what brought life to Earth and inside it there is one more thing.  Not hope, as most versions of the Greek myth tell us, but a plague that will wipe out all life on earth.  Lara is interested in the box because her reason d'etre is that: ""Everything lost is meant to be found.""  But evil scientist Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), a Nobel prize winner who is apparently searching for the perfect poison, wants what is in the box.  Along for the ride is Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a charming rogue from Lara's past who might be the yin to her yang.
Alexander the Great is involved in all of this as well, but that is just exposition.  As was the case with the first Tomb Raider film, Lara Croft goes globe trotting, visiting as many continents as possible before the final credits.  More importantly, each and every opportunity for putting in some stunts (not to be confused with CG effects) is taken advantage of, including Lara out for a horseback ride.  Director Jan de Bont (""Speed"") and first time screenwriter Dean Georgaris have put together a superior sequel, and Jolie is much more comfortable in the role.  Lara Croft's biggest similarity to James Bond is not all the stunts but the overwhelming sense of being cool.  No matter where on the planet she finds herself, Lara always knows more than here enemies and has friends close at hand.
But beneath the glamorous adventures and close brushes with death, Lara Craft has a series of reality checks to go through in ""The Cradle of Life.""  Part of it is professional, since there is growing reason to believe that finding Pandora's box is not a good idea.  But the other part is personal, since Sheridan keeps insisting there is something between them worth pursuing.  The common denominator is that both of these issues speak to Croft's feminine side.  Clearly she is all woman, but much more, and being put in the position of being either a modern Pandora or an ordinary woman does not make Lady Croft happy.  The endings of these two plot lines might be predictable, but at least they give the character and the movie some depth.
Speaking of being unhappy: This film was banned in China because ""it damaged China's reputation, giving the impression of a country in chaos, with no government and over-run by secret societies.""  A movie has to deserve at least four stars for doing something like that.",1069459200,50,3290,4.678819444444445

Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life has a better story, better action sequences, and better dialogue but it's basically the same.  The writers and directors improved on the detail, but not the big picture which leaves you wondering if there really is anything to improve.  The only saving grace of this movie is Angelina Jolie, who really seems to like the story and puts in a gutsy performance.  Other than that, the film is uninspiring.  If you got a mild kick out of the first movie like I did, and considered it an amusing summer diversion, you'll probably be bored with the second.

However, just before the destruction is complete, she climbs to the top of Alexander's statue and snags a large reflective jewel.

1916827,3,B0000CABE6,"Adventuress/archeologist Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is the first to find the mythical Luna Temple where, according to the film's legend, Alexander the Great kept his greatest treasures which were all lost when a volcanic eruption buried the Temple beneath the sea. The most unusual item in the collection is a glowing golden orb upon which is inscribed directions to the Cradle of Life, rumored to be the birthplace of life on Earth and the resting place of Pandora's Box. Pandora's Box holds the antithesis of life: a lethal plague which could destroy life on Earth if unleashed. Shortly after Lara finds the orb, it is stolen by a Chinese Crime syndicate that intends to sell the orb to Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), an international kingpin who makes biological weapons for profit. Alarmed that Pandora's Box could fall into such villainous hands, the British government seeks Lara's help in retrieving the orb and preventing Rice from finding the Cradle of Life. Lara enlists the help of her former lover and  convicted traitor, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) in tracking down the mysterious orb and the Box to which it holds the key.

""The Cradle of Life"" is the second movie based on the video game ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"". I don't think the writing is as good as the first film, but there are some fairly creative and entertaining action sequences. Angelina Jolie is, once again, the perfect Lara Croft. She looks the part. She projects a larger-than-life presence onscreen. Croft is charismatic, mischievous, tireless and shares with Jolie a certain joie de vivre that makes her captivating even in the midst of the occasional really silly scene. ""The Cradle of Life"" gives us some spectacular views of exotic locales under the Mediterranean Sea, in China, and in Africa. I found the adventures in China to be the most visually interesting, as well as being where the most creative new stunts are employed. The last third of the film goes downhill. Once it reaches Africa, the film employs too many clichs and way too much CGI. It loses all basis in reality and any sense of excitement with it. ""The Cradle of Life"" isn't a bad film. As long as you treat it like most action films and don't insist that it make much sense, the first two thirds of the film are enjoyable on an eye-candy level. This time the filmmakers have included some eye candy for the ladies in the audience, as well, in the form of actor Gerard Butler. Terry Sheridan is a sexy and irreverent bad boy -and not too hard on the eyes.

The DVD: This is a nice fully-loaded disc. The audio commentary by director Jan de Bont is good. It can be turned on using the menu, but it can't be turned off that way. To turn it off, press ""audio"" on your remote. There is a series of five short ""making of"" documentaries called ""featurettes"" that discuss the film's training, vehicles and weapons, stunts, visual effects, and scoring. Other bonus features include a DVD-ROM of the film's website (Windows only), deleted scenes, actor Gerard Butler's screen test, and 2 music videos. I recommend the Featurette documentaries and, if you still haven't had enough, Jan de Bont's audio commentary. If you only have time to watch one extra, I recommend the ""Stunts"" featurette.",1069286400,3,3240,4.802867383512544
1916828,3,B0000CABE6,"It is hard to describe a movie that is so average quality.  British made/based movies today seem to rely too much on computer graphics:  The Lord of the Ring, Harry Potter, and James Bond.  They follow much of the same chemistry that the originally movie had developed and regurgitated it in the following movie with a little different story.  The second Harry Plotter's movie flowed in the similar rhythm as the first movie.  Tomb Raider II also flows in a similar style to the first one which equal to Tomb Raider I is Tomb Raider II.
Angelina Jolie is now almost synonymous to Lara Croft.  Her character is strong, beautiful, and tough, which is simply the whole movie. If you like that, then Tomb Raider is god sent to you.  Her supporting casts and her male companion are even less developed and uneventful then in the first movie.  Her male companion, this time a British's prisoner had the same fate as the first, with having similar plotting question if he would be true to Lara or to himself. The first movie was a two liners: Lara Croft finds the treasure and finding peace with her deceased father.  This movie is a one liner; finding the treasure (Pandora's Box), but not opening it.  The concept about a movie using a great mythical idea of Pandora's Box was not used affectively in the interplay with the storyline.
The graphic was on par with the first.  The action was more Hong Kong's style on the edge of bizarre and cool.  Unlike, the first movie the scenes were not as jumpy and moves smoothly.  Lara's quest for the treasure moves from one area to another chronically.  The first movies bounced Lara from exotic locals to her home and back forcefully.
The DVD content is average to other DVD special, having deleted scene, commentaries, how the movies was developed and created.  There were two average music videos with Korn and Paycheck?  There is nothing too interesting in the special features that I can recommend looking into.  The surround sound is OK, but not too thrawning and nothing like Black Hawk Down.

Angelina Jolie proved that she could always make a hollow character a real character but that's all about the movie. There are different sets and background ranging from the Greek Islands, to the hybrid of modern and fishing Hong Kong, and the African Safari.

That was exactly what I needed to see last night and it looked like it was a bad decision. Except for the extraordinary landscapes where they shot the movie (Kenya, Santorini - Greece, China), and the sexy hero Angelina Jolie, I don't think there is anything else to enjoy.
Despite the fact that the intention was to make an adventure movie, Lara Croft - The Cradle of Life, was boring at times and at a certain moment I started to look at my watch, unpatient to leave the cinema. The film makers did not manage to keep the suspense during the 2 hours, although they seemed to do a good job at the beginning.

Very attractive Angelina Jolie returns as Lara Croft, the female Indiana Jones-type hero.  This time she's after Pandora's Box.

Okay, the story was a little better than the first one and Angelina Jolie seems to be more comfortable playing Lady Lara Croft in this one than in its predecessor, but I was still disappointed.  I would have hoped that the director and his crew would have learned from their mistakes the first time and fixed some of the errors.  Unfortunately, they did not.  So, if you liked the first one, you will like this one.  Or, if you are looking for a film that is a bunch of random action sequences strung together - some of which are actually pretty cool, I'll admit - with a wild, far-fetched ending, then this is the movie for you.  Or, if you just like to watch Angeline Jolie in tight clothing than this is still the movie for you.

I was expecting a bad movie filled with special effects and Angelina's beauty to distract the viewer's attention from the bad plot and story. I was right in some aspects, wrong in others.
The movie is not as bad as I expected. It certainly is much better than the first one. The visual effects and action scenes (jumping from buildings, crashing vehicles, etc.) are very good, thought the fighting scenes are below average for an action flick. Even some of the new characters are interesting, like the ones played by Gerard Butler and Ciaran Hinds. That, the very nice film locations, and Angelina Jolie's presence (tanned, green eyes, full lips and british accent) are the best aspects of the movie. Angelina is a very good choice for playing Lara Croft: natural presence, good acting, excellent facial expressions, shaped body.
Lara Croft has a huge potential as a character: something like Indiana Jones, but with less clothes and much more money and eletronic gadgets. But what really amazes me is that the movie, even spending a budget of $90 millions, has a plot that is so plainly bad! I watched the movie the day before yesterday, and I already don't remember half of it. The studio could pay a better script-writer, at least. And some of the technical aspects are terrible. For example, in the final scenes in the ""Valley of death"" and in the caves, the scenery is so bad that I could not help thinking it was only a studio shot. That always apoils the fun in a movie for me.
I like the Lara Croft caracter. I hope the next installment is better.

The main attraction of it are the exotic locations and fancy stunts.  Other than that, skip it.  Unless you're just into Angelina Jolie (who wouldn't be?) then I guess see it, if you still can.  Angelina Jolie does offer a nice performace to the role of Lara Croft.  Though I think I've had more fun playing the
actual video games than viewing this one.  Well anyways here's the plot:
  Lara Croft returns to find the key to Pandora's Box.  A deadly leader played by Ciaran Hinds wants it to unleash a plauge which could just about wipe out the entire global population.  Croft needs an insider though, someone such as Terry
Shaw to help her track it down.
  Some of the action sequences though are unfortunately short and seem as if they could've been longer to be more enthralling. Though it is better than its predecessor it lacks a solid plot.  Only for fancer and more sophisticated stunts (not action scenes) and locations is this one worth viewing.
  The Cradle of Life is rated PG-13 for Action Violence and Some Sensuality.  The violence includes gun battles, sword and fistfights.  The sexuality is for the most part mild, some sexual innuendo mainly.  Saw it in theatres, if you haven't seen anything else then see it, otherwise wait till it his the shelves at Blockbuster.

1916842,3,B0000CABE6,"Let's face it, LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE is an improvement over is predecessor. The story flows together better and actually makes sense than the previous installment. The action sequences are more exciting and Lara Croft seems more like a real person. Nevertheless, THE CRADLE OF LIFE isn't much of a movie. The story revolves around the mythological Pandora's Box which as we learn in the film, is an actual artifact supposedly containing a biological/genetic disease that could wipe out most of the world's population. A criminal manufacture of such diseases wants the box so he can wipe out the cesspool of humanity and begin again. It's upon to Lara Croft to stop him.

The movie is full of cliches and if you've never played any of the video games, it doesn't offer much except Angelina Jolie and one really awesome skyscraper-diving scene. The film jumps around from one location to the next and Lara's former boyfriend is more of a drag than anything else.

Overall, if you're not a Lara Croft or Jolie fan, you probably won't enjoy this movie and shouldn't waste your time watching this rehash.",1061683200,,1120,4.828125
1916854,4,B0000CABE6,"If you're like me, someone who enjoyed the first movie, loved the idea of Lara Croft and thought that just maybe they could have done more with it, welcome to the film that did do more with it.
Since other reviews have already gone over the plot and their favorite moments, I just wanted to reassure the fans who were hesitating over whether or not this film broke the bad sequel tradition that yes, it does, admirably! Definitely the perfect Saturday night movie with high likability, great stunts, wonderfully choreagraphed fight scenes - no obvious wires - beautiful exotic locales, fine special effects, fun techno gizmos.
It even has a bit of a love story added in for extra emotions. We know Lara is invulnerable, but what about the guy who is her perfect match? Is he a perfect match and will he be able to keep up with her until the very end? To find out, you'll have to see it. I won't spoil it for you! :)",1061337600,4,915,4.420118343195266

1916857,4,B0000CABE6,"The thing that makes Angelina Jolie so successful in most of the roles that she plays is that we, the audience sense a natural intelligence behind those huge, limpid eyes. It is also what makes her so sexy and sultry. As Lady Croft she is not only intelligent but street/smart, physically adept and naturally athletic.
As directed but Jan de Bont, the latest Croft adventure sports an interesting plot line involving a bad guy who wants to take possession of Pandora's box and how and why Croft prevents him from doing so.
Gerard Butler (from PBS's ""The Jury"") looking buff and bronzed, is Croft's latest squeeze but to say that they have a relationship would be neither understating nor overstating the actual situation. Suffice it to say, they have feelings for each other. Unfortunately there is very little romantic play between the two.
""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" gets a bit sappy towards the end but all in all it is a hoot with de Bont pulling out all the stops, production-wise. Jolie also looks swell in her various, spray painted on costumes. And she rides sidesaddle while target shooting as befitting a Lady, too!",1060128000,,1143,4.777777777777778
1916858,4,B0000CABE6,"It seems ironic that this year sees a pantheon of action heroes.  The Indiana Jones trilogy is coming out on DVD.  H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quartermain leads a pack of fictional heroes in LXG.  And that other archaeologist searching for things that might be better left alone, the well-bronzed, well-toned, Amazon-like Lara Croft, is back in her second full-screen adventure.  She is well-equipped as in the first film.  Oh yes, and she also has her usual barrage of hi-tech gadgets, ;.) chief of which is a headset with a small monitor screen extending in front of her eye.
The discovery of Alexander The Great's Lunar Temple under the Mediterranean Sea leads Lara to its watery grave.  The Temple is well realized, down to the giant statue on the throne.  A fight with some gunmen leads the remains of the Temple to collapse, but not before Lara photographs a golden sphere with a series of holes in it.
The sphere is the map where Alexander found Pandora's box,--those who have taken Greek Mythology 101 should recognize that name.  However, its powers were so terrible, Alexander had the box returned to its origin and concealed the map.
Dr. Reiss wants it to use it as a biological weapon and has contracted Chen Lo to get it.  It is Lo's men who ambushed Croft in the Temple.
Croft turns down MI6's usual agents as backup.  Instead, she gets an ex-agent-turned-traitor, the rough-looking bemuscled Terry Sanford, to guide her to Chen Lo, and has him sprung from a prison in Kazakhstan to that end.  However, she has special clearance to terminate him at any times she deems necessary.  They are quite a pair, and one scene with motorcycles show them trying to outrace each other in a clear match of who is the alpha person in this mission, but the two have had a shared moment between them in the past.  At one point Sanford remarks they are a pair and Lara rebuts that they are different, and that difference in character emerges.
Much of the movie scenes are retreads of other action films.  The scene in the temple with two guides mirrors that of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and the parachute scene in Hong Kong that from any number of James Bond movies.  However, the underwater scenes weren't that bad, and the way she parachutes into her African friend Kosa's jeep is sheer style.
And there's no adequate explanation given to why Sanford betrayed his country.  Yet Gerald Butler portrays him as someone who may be good in a fight with weapons, but not trustworthy.
 Lara Croft has ditched the familiar black outfit for yes, the smart-looking silver-gray scuba suit depicted in the movie poster, and a khaki outfit during the China and Hong Kong leg of her adventure.  However, the use of some vehicles seem to be the obligatory equivalent of gratuitous T&A.  Aside from the motorcycle sequence. she shows off doing trick stunts on her waterbike in her first appearance onscreen.  Still, Angelina Jolie proves more than ever, with that long black hair, tanned bod, and hard-set but mischievous eyes, that Lara Croft is her role.
Noah Taylor and Christopher ""Red Dwarf"" Barrie return as Bryce and Hillary, Lara's computer expert and butler, respectively.  Red Dwarf fans won't be too happy, as Barrie doesn't have too many lines, plus his role's a bit thankless and barely noticeable.  In the one extended scene he has, he and Lara are practicing with staffs after the latter's Mediterranean adventure.  And Ciaran Hinds as Rice seems to have read the copybook of the typical James Bond villain a bit too much.
One line repeated is that maybe some treasures are best left alone.  Despite its derivative scenes, Tomb Raider 2 doesn't deserve to be left shut like Pandora's Box.  It merits a few peeks, as it's as good as the first Tomb Raider film.",1060128000,,3754,4.7384615384615385
1916859,4,B0000CABE6,"OK, first let me say that like most other red blooded males, I think Angelina Jolie is absolutely gorgeous.  So Ill pay to see her in any Tomb Raider movie she does.  That being said, I did expect a little more from this one.  The basic plot has Lara Croft searching for Pandoras Box.  As the movie opens, Croft finds an orb that represents the map to the boxs location, the so called cradle of life.  As we would expect, the map has to be deciphered first.  There are also a host of baddies who want to obtain the box and unleash a deadly plague.  The orb is stolen from Croft by a band of mercenaries soon after she discovers it. MI-6, realizing the danger of the orb and the man who has paid to have it stolen, convince Croft to retrieve it.  She agrees with the proviso that she is allowed to spring a former lover turned mercenary from prison, in exchange for his help.  So the journey begins that will lead Lara Croft across the globe in a battle to retrieve the orb and protect its secrets.
The movie features several action sequences with some very impressive James Bond-like stunts.  Jolie plays Lara Croft with a harder edge as compared to the first.  Despite all of the action though, the movie is hurt by the fact that the story seems to drag in several places.  I think a little too much time was spent on retrieving the orb.  Additionally, the love interest story line didn't seem to work all that well.  The last 30 minutes or so of the movie were quite good and featured some pretty cool CGI monsters that guard the cradle of life.  Along with the opening sequence, this was more of what I expected from the movie.  Despite the minor flaws, the movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable.  Its worth seeing on the big screen and the DVD will be a sure buy for me when it becomes available.  3 stars for the movie and 1 star because Angelina Jolie is in it.",1060041600,,1872,4.315186246418338

There were some toys from the movie I'd seen of some monsters or creatures or something and they drew me out.  While they were cool and the movie was better than the original, that's not really saying that much.
Lara Croft finds some sunken treasure from Alexander the Great beneath the ocean, which includes a sphere that looks like a bowling ball made of amber.  She looses it to some other treasure hunters and finds out that it's a map to the Cradle of Life, where Pandora's Box is kept.  The ""bad guy"" wants the box to sell as the ultimate weapon so Lara's got to go save the day.  The monsters I described above are the guardians of the box.

I was kind of a big fan of the first movie, but wasn't really expecting much from this one. But in actuality, it wasn't a bad movie, just a little less interesting. The plot was alright, but there were quite a few good action scenes.

1916873,1,B0000CABE6,"It takes a true master of the cinema to create a film this barren of any entertainment value. The behind the scenes work is so poor, it's a wonder that some wayward microphone lugger didn't catch the producer telling the director, ""don't bother with retakes, people will go see it anyway."" In a film that is at least supposed to wow us with James Bond/Indiana Jones style action, the effects and choreography are exceptionally bad; to the point where it looks like some kid shot the scenes on the Warner lot with his parents' camcorder. The sets look clearly like sets, and in parts even appear unfinished and unpainted. Frequent slow motion moments trying to capture some of the Matrix 'cool' end up choppy and painful to watch. Those of you looking for a rehash of the original - and come on, even the original wasn't that good - this is tragically far from comparison. Alas, the big bad guys over in Hollywood know that with a decent marketing campaign and a name like 'Laura Croft', the movie pays for itself in the first weekend. Who cares if its good? It's not about good. It's about money.
For those of you that are still un-deterred by my heavy reality dosing here, let me move on to the completely ridiculous story. Evil bad guy wants to kill everyone on the planet for a profit with an ancient doomsday device... Pandora's Box. Yup, in 'Cradle of Life', Pandora's Box is real and contains the plague to end all plagues. Alexander the Great hid the map that leads to the box - a sort of pre-modern-civ videotape - in a giant temple underwater. The entire film involves the back and forth hijinx of capturing this object. At the end, they use the map, go to Africa, find 'the Cradle of Life' - where all life came from and is now inhabited by strange monsters - and battle over the box. The final set-piece in the film looks more like a segment of the Universal Studios E.T. ride than it does any place that might actually exist. Growing up (and now, I admit it) I had Star Wars toys that looked more realistic. If you really really really want to waste your money, go see this movie and remember to laugh at all the bad parts; its the only way you'll have any fun.",1059436800,5,2173,4.435
1916874,3,B0000CABE6,"One of the chief pleasures of watching Tomb Raider is the sight of Angelina Jolie's rockin' bod.  It is truly mesmerizing - whether she's packed into a skin-tight wet suit or canting about on her horse.  To add insult to injury, she's a great actress too.  I really dig the sexy English accent she has going on.
This movie rises and falls by Angelina Jolie.  It works because we enjoy watching her.  She is pretty to look at and the movie is pretty to look at.  The plot makes almost no sense.  An earthquake kicks up some artifacts that reveal Alexander the Great's sunken temple, which has been under water for two-THOUSAND years, with a leaky ceiling, and is completely dry inside.  There she finds a prehistoric disco ball, which is REALLY a map to Pandora's Box.  In this movie, the box is a magical (or extra-terrestrial?) thing that began life on Earth.  Riiiiiight.  Of course, disease is the plot-du-jour these days, so it also contains a virus that will eliminate most of the worlds population.
I am unfamiliar with the video game, but the movie has the feel of a video game.  Lady Croft doesn't even bother dodging bullets because she knows they won't hit her.  She is capable of things Indiana Jones wouldn't even dream of and she accomplishes it all while still looking perdy.  Jan de Bont, who I guess has fallen on hard times, directs the movie with a lot of great stunts and it is a diverting couple of hours.  Overall though, the movie leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  All these blockbusters imitate the films of Stephen Speilberg, but they haven't watched them closely enough.  Never end your film on a downer and this film lands on an unnecessary downer.  It's fun but don't go expecting great art - or even a great blockbuster.",1059436800,,1748,4.565916398713826
1916875,1,B0000CABE6,"I'm suprised to be the first naysayer for this movie.  I did like the first movie, and I do think Angie rose to the occasion to make it more than it would have been.  But where that film succeeded I think was in the novelty of bringing a beloved video game girl to the big screen.  It was silly and made little sense - but we indulged because it was kind of a one-time thing - ""let's just see how it plays out on screen.""  Good enough . . . but they couldn't resist sequelitis.
And so we have this mess.  No more novelty, just really lame movie-making.  I tried SO hard to give this movie every chance - but from punching a shark in the face to get a ride in the opening scene - to the completely unsubstantiated twist with her boyfriend in the final scene, this movie laid disappointment after disappointment on me.  With little explanation as to why they were going from one place to the next, the characters just seemed to find ways to constantly have guns drawn and villains to blow away.  Nothing wrong with that - if the action is good - but one-hit wonder Jan de Bont (SPEED) hasn't a clue how to bring any interest to even a simple gun battle.
Completely uninspired, even Angelina seems bored half the time and, aside from a cute moment borrowing bubble-gum from a little girl, she seem to be having no fun with the character (the one aspect that truly made the original memorable).
Sorry, folks, this one's not even worth matinee!",1059436800,8,1439,4.343283582089552
1916876,4,B0000CABE6,"If you liked the first film in the Tomb Raider series, ""Cradle of Life"" will deliver just as much fun. The sequel begins with artistocratic archeological adventuress Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) diving off the coast of Greece, where a volcanic eruption has uncovered the fabled Lunar Temple. Within the underwater temple, Lara discovers a mysterious orb. As with many of her tomb raids, however, things soon go awry, and the orb falls into enemy hands.
Representatives of the British intelligence agency MI-5 recruit Lara to retrieve the orb, which Alexander the Great created as a map to Pandora's Box. MI-5 fears that a scientist known for creating biological agents will use a plague contained in Pandora's Box to create weapons of terror. Lara scoffs at MI-5's offer to send agents to assist her, and insists on an assistant of her own choosing--a possibly untrustworthy mercenary (Gerard Butler) who is her former lover. And thus the quest for the orb begins anew.
Once again, Jolie brings to Lara Croft a terrific mixture of Indiana Jones' daring and cleverness, James Bond's class and grace under fire and an acrobatic combat style, wittiness and sex appeal all her own. She makes a very appealing heroine that both men and women can enjoy. At one point, as she is checking from rural China in via cell phone, her assistant asks her what she's doing, and she coyly comments ""Accessorizing"" as she straps on automatic weapons and knives.
Lara is a woman used to doing things her way, as evidenced by how unimpressed she acts when the MI-5 agents tell her that the Queen requires her assistance in retrieving the orb. She aims her dry wit equally at her mercenary ex-lover and the thieves attempting to keep control of the orb.
The rapport between Gerard and Jolie is somewhat reminiscent of the repartee once seen on the silver screen between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Although their barbs aren't quite as rapid fire as ""His Girl Friday"" dialogue, the tension and lingering attraction between the two add spice to the movie. The question of whether Lara really can trust Terry (Gerard) to not double-cross her, and cut a better deal with the unsavory characters seeking the orb creates additional suspense.
One disappointment in ""Cradle of Life"" was that the puzzles that Lara must solve to find her way to Pandora's Box aren't as complex as the puzzles in the first ""Tomb Raider."" Most of the puzzle work is done via computer with Lara sending images back to her assistant to crack back home. The imperative to find the orb and get to Pandora's Box wasn't quite the race against the clock involved in the first ""Tomb Raider,"" where pieces to the triangle that controlled time could only be retrieved during certain moments in a planetary alignment. Consequently, while the need to beat the bad guys to the next step was obviously important, the clock didn't seem to be running quite as quickly.
Nevertheless, ""Cradle of Life"" does not disappoint with its breathtaking travelogue-style cinematography and its tricky stunts. A series of gymnastic maneuvers that Lara executes to climb atop the roof of the underwater temple and a motorcycle ride along the Great Wall of China were reminiscent of the settings in the first two Tomb Raider games. In other scenes, Lara flees from her captor among Chinese terra-cotta tomb warriors, and then rappels head first down a sheer cliff. The spiral passageways leading to the hiding place of Pandora's Box created an eerie and exotic setting.
Overall, ""Cradle of Life"" is a lot of fun! The love story between Lara and Terry adds a complexity to the action. The exotic settings and the kick-butt stunts add up to a sequel that's just as interesting to watch as the first. See this on the big screen. While I'm sure the DVD will be good, the sweeping views of China, Greece and Africa won't translate as well to the small screen.  See it now!",1059350400,29,3896,4.832335329341317

With that said, this movie is definetly better than the first (and by my standards, the first was pretty much great).  This time around, we don't have the whole I MISS DADDY subplot, but we just have Lara doing what the character was meant to do - going after the fortunes of the lost tombs, with a couple of missteps along the way :-).  To me, anyone that digs the whole Indiana Jones type movies, to miss this one would be a wrong descision. Lara Croft without a doubt, is the new version of that kind of action/adventure hero, and does it without being anything other than Lara Croft (who just happens to be a woman).  This movie continues to tear down the myth of leading action female roles, and we are all the better for it.  Sure, there are impossibilites, non-realities, etc.  But when we go to see these kinds of movies, we willingly leave all preconceived notions at the door and just go in to have fun.

1916878,4,B0000CABE6,"First off, I one of the minority that enjoyed the first Tomb Raider, so I walked into this one with hopes for the best, despite what the critics were saying.  Critics, huh?  Who needs 'em?
Angelina Jolie is radiant as ever; she's sexy, slick, and incredibly intelligent and resourceful.  The part where she sucker-punches a shark is damn cool.  Needless to say, Jolie is the best part of the franchise, even if her acrobatics are unrealistically perfect.
The story and acting is improved over the first.  The ""Cradle of Life"" plot is preposterous, of course, but how it fits into the bad guy's evil plan is pretty sinister, and it makes sense with all the real world fear of chemical and biological weaponry.  The villain is less of a man of action than Iain Glen in TR1, but this new guy is more sophisticated, smarter, and meaner.  Gerard Butler, though half his dialogue in incomprehensible thanks to his accent, works well as Jolie's counterpart/love interest, and his character strikes me as just the kind of guy Lara Croft is likely to fall for.
The locations are beautiful to behold, especially in China and Africa.  The ""sky-diving over Hong Kong"" sequence is just short of drool-worthy.  However, some of the interior sets are just plain bland.
The action scenes are the one downer here; Jan de Bont downshifts from Simon West's starting point, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  I wanted more from the gunfights, which seemed lethargic.  My two favorite scenes in the movie are when Lara duels with Chen Lo (she defends herself with an unloaded bayonet rifle by twirling it like a trained Marine...super badass) and the CGI ""Shadow Demons"" sequence, which I was originally dreading, but the way the scene is edited makes it rather cool.
If you enjoyed the first Tomb Raider, check this one out.  For all its flaws, Angelina is worth it.  ALL HAIL ANGELINA... ANGELINA IS YOUR QUEEN...",1059350400,5,1909,4.801223241590214
1916879,3,B0000CABE6,"Saw LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE TITLE'S TOO LONG last night, and it was pretty good, I guess. It's hard to judge a movie's quality when your expectations are so low. I mean, it's a sequel to a pretty mediocre movie that's based upon a video game. Meanwhile, it's also borrowing elements, mood, whole plot points and its ending from the INDIANA JONES movies. So, though I felt like I'd seen everything in it (with the exception of that marvelous skyscraper/parachute-suit jump that was actually done in real life - no CGI), I suppose I had a pretty good time. And Anjelina Jolie is cool.
It's the sort of movie that you go into with a checklist of things you expect to see. Exotic, international locales. Ancient legends. A glowing box with roots that hearken back to the beginning of time that, if opened, will cause massive destruction. A missing temple. Gang members. Machine gun fire. A good-looking guy with a quick wisecrack every few minutes.
So, though it felt been-there, done-that, I guess I have to recommend it somewhat. It's well-done, and that one stunt is cool.",1059350400,,1075,4.723404255319149
1916880,4,B0000CABE6,"First of all Angelina Jolie is/has become a very beautiful woman.
However this movie was a little too unrealistic for me to believe. I never had the oppurtunity to see the first one but my movie partner reassured me that this one was better. So what I have to go on is just what was on the screen in front me. So this review is not a reflection of the series, just ""The Cradle of Life"".
I do believe in women's independence and have authority and power. But in this movie, Lara Croft was probably thinking ""who the heck are all these co-stars and extras?"". She acted like she did not need anybody's (especially the men) help and became a one woman army (look out Wonder Woman). I thought the acting was a little too ""fake"" or plastic. I don't recall once in the picture that Lara's facial expression changed. When she was happy or sad or angry or determined; she looked unphased. There are two scenes that seemed too odd to me.  The first is when she goes underwater and found the orb. When she was climbing the statue is when it looked odd. It was either a CGI effect or the wire pulled her too early. Still with this scene, she tries to get to the surface because her escape vehicle was destroyed. She holds her breath (amazingly too long) and cuts her arm to attract a hungry shark. The shark (which was horribly computer generated) charges right at her. And in keeping with a cartoon type fashion, Lara proceedes to punch the shark to show who has dominace. The shark woobles it's head and tries to leave. When it does, Lara grabs hold of its' top fin and glides to the surface. The other scene that seems too odd was the ""falling off the rock scene (by wire)"" with her male partner Terry. They are falling backwards off the cliff with guns aimed at the top of the rock. With pin point accuracy they shot their enemies. What was odd was not just the shooting but the way they landed. With split second timing, they flipped right side up and landed on their feet (like a cat). Then acted as though they did not just fall off a cliff; but had a good lunch instead.
As for some good points, Jolie's body looks great and toned. The ""rock forest"" sequence was intense. Those rock creatures were unique and original. For as much fighting and violence, there was very little blood seen.
I guess I would have to see the first one to have a stronger opinion about the series. But this review only reflects how I feel about this movie. It was not a stinker but it did not smell like a rose.
Would I see it again? NO. Would I buy the DVD? Maybe.
It's a good movie if you like action (even if it is corny in some spots) and stiff acting (however Jolie pulled a very good and very sexy accent).",1059350400,,2685,4.295857988165681
