4373497,4,B004GJYRBY,"This is Randolph Scott at hiis best. Good western adventure and very entertaining. I was always a Randoph Scott fan so these old westerns were right down my alley. Well recommended and sustained entertainment. Also, good story lines and Joel Macrae in Ride The High Country is in good form and also at his best. Overall, definitely worth watching.",1333324800,,347,4.898305084745763
4373498,5,B004GJYRBY,"FORT WORTH is not as great as the other movies, but films like RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY with Randolph Scott are as good as they get. COLT .45 later became a TV series of the same name. Warner Brothers used to offer these as singles at the same price you can now buy all four. If you really want to see some of the best Westerns of the 1950s, this is the one to get.",1327536000,11,362,3.84
4373499,5,B004GJYRBY,"Randolph Scott was probably one of the greatest Western Heroes of the 20th Century...2nd only to the great John Wayne!  Most of the films Scott appeared in were Westerns and this excellent collection contains 4! Before I cover the titles...be sure and keep your eyes open for all the character actors! Many would appear later on TV as well as in other classic films!

COLT.45: Scott portrays a salesman of the soon to-be-available firearm.  Troubles occur when his demonstrator model is stolen.

FORT WORTH:  A wayward outpost sets the stage for a story based on fact.  Scott and several volunteers do their best to keep the Mexicans away.

TALL MAN RIDING: Randolph Scott matches wits with an incredibly stubborn horse...'nuff said!

RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY: The very last film for Randolph Scott as well as for Joel McCrea. Two former partners are searching for a gold mine. Included in this arrangement is a very young girl (Mariette Hartley) who is desperate to escape from her abusive Father. It's the ""grand finale"" for Scott and McCrea..even though the ending is somewhat sad.

There aren't a lot of EXTRAS with the exception of a trailer or two.  But I give this collection 5 STARS because the films...as well as their technical quality...are EXCELLENT!  Hopefully, Warner Bros will combine another 4 (or possibly 6) Randolph Scott movies in a package similar to this one?  Believe me! You're going to watch ALL 4 more than once!",1319846400,43,1435,4.884297520661157
4373500,5,B004GJYRBY,Bought this set as a gift for my father. He loves all of the movies and really enjoyed them. Great Purchase.,1312243200,17,108,4.190476190476191
4373501,3,B004GJYRBY,Colt 45 is interesting and valuable from an historical view[point--stereotyping of Native Americans....High Country is however worth buying the set...the other 2 are not up to par with Scott's better work as with Botticher,1307577600,12,222,5.5588235294117645
4373502,4,B004GJYRBY,"Three of these films I would rate as 4 star for what category they are - 50's vintage color westerns with a great western lead actor - Randolph Scott.  An example is Fort Worth, that had a fine plot and many twists to it, keeping you guessing on how it was going to wrap up.  We will be watching them again.  We found Riding the High Country to be less than what we prefer of these vintage films due to the much later age of the actors and content with some off-color words - it was probably made in the 60s. But as a 4 film package for one price, it is a bargain.",1302307200,3,564,3.9298245614035086
4373523,1,B004GJYRBY,Tall Man Riding freezes at the beginning right after Randolph Scott has a shootout with 3 men.  Can't get video to continue due to this flaw! The other films are ok.

4373582,5,B004GJYRBY,"Enjoyable! Good classic Westerns. All 4 are excellent to good. I also thought sound and picture were all good. My order of best is: 1) Tall Man Riding, Real good, slightly different story line, costarring with Dorothy Malone and good supporting cast, which also includes a young Peggy Castle too. 2) Ride the High Country. This was Scott's last appearance in a movie and it was a critically acclaimed one as well. He retired to a wealthy, happy life after that movie. He said, he felt it was one of, if not his best western movie, and he wanted to leave the movie scene on a high note, which he certainly did. Scott and Joel McCrea were great together, as was the supporting cast. Randolph Scott went off into the sunset on his own terms, 3) Colt 45 and 4) Fort Worth. Scott was a very rich, multi-millionaire when he left Hollywood behind. One last bit of trivia. You may notice that Scott rides the same horse in more than one of these movies. That beautiful horse's name was ""Stardust"". While Randolph Scott didn't own Stardust, it was his favorite horse to ride in his movies, and he did so as often as he could.",1451865600,11,1116,4.4487804878048784

The fourth, ""Ride The High Country"" is, in my estimation, one of the 10 greatest westerns of all time.  Good value, even if you only watch the first three once.  Of course, you can always buy ""High Country"" separately and not waste time on the other movies.",1438992000,,403,4.882352941176471

So the value for money was good, and  the bonus material is probably good quality, if I ever get around to watching them.",1397347200,,408,4.0625
4373618,5,B004GJYRBY,"There is nothing not to like when it comes to Randolph Scott films.  While the production values don't measure up to today's standards, the old westerns for the most part were filmed in days or weeks not months or years.  They cranked out many of these films as ""B"" movies to be shown with a main or ""A"" feature or doubled for Saturday matinees.

They are light, fun to watch films that follow formulaic scripts: bad guy wrongs good guy or pals - good guy goes ofter bad guy - bad guy get his comeuppance, or similar tales. Randolph Scott is one of the best good guys in filmed westerns.  He is, for the most part, believable and loveable and sometimes gets the girl.

4373619,5,B004GJYRBY,"THREE RANDOLPH SCOTT FILMS FROM THE '50'S ON ONE DISK, PLUS HIS LAST WESTERN ON  ITS OWN DISK, THIS COMPILIATION WILL SATISFY THE MOST DIE HARD SCOTT FAN AS WELL AS A FIRST TIME VIEWER. IN ""COLT .45"" HE IS AN EX-ARMY SALESMAN FOR SAMUEL COLT, BRINGING COLT'S NEW ""SIX SHOOTER"" TO THE ATTENTION OF LAWMEN. DURING A DEMONSTRATION TO A TOWN SHERIFF, A MAN WHO THE SHERIFF IS THROWING OUT OF TOWN BREAKS FREE, GRABS THE PISTOLS, KILLS THE SHERIFF AND TRIES TO IMPLICATE SCOTT AS AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS ESCAPE. AFTER BEING HELD BY THE NEW SHERIFF FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, SCOTT IS ORDERED RELEASED BY A JUDGE FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE AND VOWS TO RECLAIM HIS GUNS AND CLEAR HIS NAME BY BRINGING THE MURDERER TO JUSTICE. ""FORT WORTH"" FINDS SCOTT RETURNING TO TEXAS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. SICKENED BY THE CARNAGE OF THE WAR, SCOTT HAS HUNG UP HIS GUNS AND TURNED TO JOURNALISM AS A MEANS OF BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE AND PROGRESS. CONVINCED TO SET UP SHOP IN FORT WORTH, HE FINDS HIMSELF IN CONFLICT WITH AN ALREADY RICH MAN DETERMINED TO MANIPULATE THE TOWN FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT. SCOTT PLAYS A COWBOY RETURNING TO HIS OLD TOWN TO AVENGE HIMSELF ON THE RANCHER WHO BROKE UP HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RANCHER'S DAUGHTER AND WHIPPED SCOTT OUT OF TOWN IN ""TALL MAN RIDING"". LAST, BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST,  IS ""RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY"", DIRECTED BY SAM PECKINPAH. CO-STARRING WITH JOEL MC CREA, AND FILMED IN 1962 AT THE END OF THEIR FILM CAREERS, IT HAS BECOME A TRUE CLASSIC WESTERN, TIMELESS AND UNFORGETABLE.. THE STORY IS OF TWO AGING LAWMEN, LONG TIME FRIENDS WHO MEET AFTER YEARS OF SEPARATION, MC CREA HAS CONTINUED TO WORK IN LAW AT VARIOUS JOBS WHILE SCOTT HAS TEAMED UP WITH A YOUNG HOTHEAD AND HAS REDUCED HIS CAREER AS A LAWMAN TO A SIDESHOW ACT.  MC CREA HAS JUST BEEN HIRED BY A BANK TO BUY GOLD FROM A CAMP FAR UP IN THE HILLS AND BRING IT DOWN THE BANDIT RIDDEN TRAIL TO THE BANK. HE HIRES SCOTT AND HIS SIDEKICK TO AID HIM, UNAWARE THAT SCOTT'S INTENTION IS TO CONVINCE HIM TO DOUBLE CROSS THE BANK AND STEAL THE GOLD. ALONG THE WAY TO THE CAMP, THE TRIO MEET A YOUNG WOMAN DETERMINED TO MARRY A MINER AND ESCAPE HER TYRANNICAL FATHER. WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY, THE PLOT IS DISCOVERED AND MC CREA AND SCOTT BREAK BUT REUNITE IN THE FACE OF DANGER. BEAUTIFULLY PHOTOGRAPHED  AND FEATURING AN EVOCATIVE MUSIC SCORE, THE FILM SHOWS MUCH MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN IS USUAL IN A WESTERN, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THE HOTHEAD AND THE YOUNG WOMAN AS THEY FALL IN LOVE AND HE REALIZES THERE IS MORE IN LIFE TO BE VALUED OVER MONEY. WITH A STRONG CAST AND OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES BY THE TWO VETERAN LEAD ACTORS, THIS FILM IS WORTH THE COST BY ITSELF, WITH THE OTHER THREE AS A WELCOME BONUS.",1393632000,,2674,4.428861788617886
