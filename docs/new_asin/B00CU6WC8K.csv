5741494,4,B00CU6WC8K,"I watched this show all the way through and found it quite enjoyable for a number of reasons. 1) the artwork is stellar and not just for the characters but the environments, tech, and the Void abilities. 2) The sound track is awesome, Ryo (SuperCell) had a hand in it so that's a major bonus for me.

What I dislike about this show is the main character, Shu. He's too weak of a character to be playing this main role, in my opinion, but does a good enough job to soldier on and be apart of the 'group' so to speak. He shows some growth as he progresses through into the second half of the series but towards the end he gets a major overhaul in personality and I'm just not sure what to make of it. Also, the latter half of the second part to the series gets a little sloppy with the story and I felt like the ending was lacking.

In the end, would I buy this show despite my list of faults for it? Yeah, I would.",1369526400,34,913,4.038674033149171

5741529,1,B00CU6WC8K,"Subscribing to Funimation's online service gives me a chance to check out new anime. But I find that my newest interest called Guilty Crown is proof that Funimation is wasting their money and that anime is getting worse.

I know that some want to defend this anime, but it seems to be a case of sheep following a wolf to their death. This appears to be the entire plot with elements changing to accomodate it.

The characters do not really grow for that matter. They appear to be doing the same thing, but for different people for the same reason. In the end, if you want high quality anime, then turn to the anime of old. Macross being a prime example, as is Megazone 23.

I bought this only because I wanted it in my collection, this edition is actually very good, the special box and the booklets are amazing and I don't regret buying this.

5741553,5,B00CU6WC8K,"Beautiful animation quality, a phenomenal soundtrack, a creative story concept, but lacking heavily in story structure and some character developments. Plot holes are abundant as well. Oddly enough, I found myself enjoying this anime way more than I should have. There seems to be two opinion that most people have with this anime and nearly no middle ground.

One side absolutely loves it while the other sees it as a monstrosity whose existence should have never been made. Both sides are right to an extent. If story line, plot consistency, refreshing characters, and consistent character development is really important to you, then I would suggest not to watch this. This anime has a very creative concept but its story leaves too many open questions and unexplained events. You are forced to accept things as they come. The character development is lacking as well. Only two or three characters are given any character development, and sometimes it is inconsistent. However, I personally didn't mind this so this could be just a personal preference. However, the anime isn't terrible either in my opinion. I've seen a multitude of anime of all kinds and I can assure you that with all it's flaws, the anime is pretty average compared to many others.
If there is one thing that fans and haters alike can agree on it's on the beautiful animation quality and the breathtaking soundtrack. I personally enjoyed this anime. If you decide to give this a try, I would say go in expecting a shaky character and story setting. That way you can keep a more open mind to it and hopefully the entertainment factor will be better as well.",1410566400,2,1630,4.863309352517986

Extremely unique concepts and amazing artwork & graphics Honestly from episode 1-6 this series was an decent anime to me, but after episode 7(i think its been several months since I've watched this) it REALLY picked up! After that episode i was completely hooked and glued watching anxious to watch the next episode. Now as for the ending, its only gonna be one of two options. Your gonna be satisfied and content with the ending or your gonna have a bad taste in your mouth wanting more. For me it was a good ending but it doesn't stop me from wanting more.",1406678400,,578,4.514285714285714
5741557,5,B00CU6WC8K,"Well, I would have to say for me, this series earns the coveted 5 star rank! The art is great as is the score and I also thought the english dub was good as well. If I had any complaint, it would be the short 11 episode 1st season. Basically, Shu Oma can pull ""Voids"" out of people's hearts, each one varies and has different effects. He joins with a group called Funeral Parlor and together they try to stop the organization called GQ, which is wreaking all sorts of havoc. This has a bit of everything for everyone, you have a mix of mecha, romance, comedy, darkness, and sci-fi and action which comes together very well and keeps the audience drawn in.  If you like series like Evangelion, Gundam Wing, or Cowboy Bebop this should be right up your alley. They leave you hanging at the end of this one, so make sure you also buy season 2!!",1404345600,,841,4.289308176100629

5741571,5,B00CU6WC8K,"Check out more anime reviews: The Huge Anime Fan via Wordpress

I had previously heard some negative reviews of the series so almost passed it up but in the end watched it throughout online and thought it had such wonderful animation and music.

The ending and each episode progresses the character development just enough. There are so many heart-moving themes in this series. It has such an epic feel that feel sorry didn't get my hands on this sooner. After watching online decided to invest on it for a physical copy of Guilty Crown.

With Guilty Crown have to say love the voice actors Yuki Kaji and Ai Kayano. They are so talented and made the characters all  have a feeling of otherworldly and human traits which as have said before felt very epic. The English voice actors did a pretty good job after the Japanese voice cast.

Guilty Crown has so much to offer thanks to its complexity and it helps to dig deep to continue to see what all the themes and connections are since there is so much beyond the surface.",1394323200,2,1020,4.521739130434782

5741573,5,B00CU6WC8K,I really enjoyed part 1 of guilty crown. I did not know what to expect because the trailer is a bit misleading. It is set in the future but it doesn't involve robots as much as it is shown. Each episode passes by quickly which is a good thing because it is not a slow moving anime. The story on part 1 has a lot of action scenes and dramatic moments. I was entertained and I really enjoyed the soundtrack. I highly recommend Part 1 of Guilty Crown and if you want a more detailed explanation of events - I recommend you check out Part 2.,1394064000,,537,4.0754716981132075

5741577,5,B00CU6WC8K,"I loved this series back when it was brand new in 2011 in sub.

My only complaint which could be no ones fault except production error, is that the bluray version of the in episode commentaries is distorted. Only way to ""fix"" is to fast forward. But thankfully this comes with the dvd version as well and that works fine.

Thankfully with anime in dubbed, they also include the sub. Me personally i prefer dub over sub but some voices in here are not fitting, like Shu or Tsugumi. (Tsugumi played by Monica Rial, normally I love her Dubbing but her voice for Tsugumi is not fitting.) I will be watching this in subbed again but in HD!

Overall i personally loved guilty crown a lot, those who loved it should definetly buy the limited edition version. It's great.

This show is just unbelievably good, and I would recommend this to any anime fan. This show has AMAZING action scenes, likeable characters, GREAT visuals, a well paced story, but the Best thing about this show is its soundtrack HANDS DOWN THE BEST IVE EVER HEARD.

5741590,3,B00CU6WC8K,"Guilty Crown is a train wreck, there's simply no way around that fact.  However it doesn't honestly go off the rails till you reach part two.  The first set of episodes are fun enough, even though Shu takes the concept of a whiny protagonist to a brand new level.  They honestly should have ended the series here and that would have been good enough for me.  Video and audio quality are great, Funimation keeps up the consistency of their transfers with this title.  Doesn't change the fact the series is a terrible waste of time if you watch it completely, since I can't tell what they were thinking at all by the end.",1391558400,,619,4.442477876106195
5741591,2,B00CU6WC8K,"""Guilty Crown"" is gorgeous to look at, and has an interesting premise on the surface, but if you walk a bit further you'll quickly realize you're walking down hill.

The animation is fluid, and blends CG effects masterfully.  The fights are entertaining but don't hold up well when compared to other anime.  The character's foundations are all reused material and nothing new is added to them.  The music is compelling, but when any significant moment arrives it's replaced with J Pop.

All these things can be overlooked if they can keep the storyline together and interesting.  They don't.

The main character can pull ""voids"" from other people and each is a unique weapon that's supposed to be a representation of the person whose chest he just pulled it from (giving our hero the excuse to grope our pink-haired-pop star for weapons).  Instead of these tools representing the characters they originate from, they seem to represent the perfect solution to whatever problem currently erks them.  There's no problem solving or intensity.  They don't have to worry because the person standing next to them always has the key.  It's a cool premise that's weakly executed.

Having a young, boy hero get his powers from a hot vixen has also been done to death.  So is having every member of his teen social community jovially being tied to the fate of the world.  The lead heroine is a famous pop star and a terrorist but the authorities can't seem to catch her.  The logic of the show is full of holes like this and the storyline never bothers to explain anything resulting in a bland world ""void"" of detail where the audience is expected to follow the self obsessed emotional narrative of the wandering teens while the oppressive adults shake a gloved fist at them.

The writers of the show didn't care about their story so neither did I.  It wouldn't bother me so much except I'm reminded of how beautiful the show looks and my thoughts go to the artists and animation teams that worked really hard on something so thin.  It's a shame.",1391299200,10,2035,4.732954545454546

5741603,5,B00CU6WC8K,"So wats up? Seeing reviews saying ""Guilty Crown is lost potential."" or ""People are being to harsh?"" Well do you hate plot holes? Scenes being rushed and stuff happening that make you go ""Wuuhhhhhtt????"" and that the animation gives no explanation what so ever to possibly support what happened in that scene? basically plot holes.. IF you can't stand any of that, I do not recommend this anime.

If you got past all that and still want to watch this anime, then this anime is Awesome :3, I love art style and the OP and ED are amazing! Youtube ""guilty crown op"" and pick the first choice ""Guilty Crown - Official OP - Extreme HD"" , This song is what got me to buy this dvd set and watch it. I love supercell :D! So if the OP has peaked your interest, I Highly Recommend you to watch this anime, it was worth while watch even with the plot holes. Keep this review short, If you are very critical about story, Most likely if you hate the 2nd part of Sword art online, you would probably hate this too. If not and your like me who almost likes everything :3 , Watch. its a great show with amazing art and music to back it up!",1386460800,,1122,4.21860465116279
5741604,5,B00CU6WC8K,"So this is my review for the show. To all the people who are being harsh on the show, Funimation ran out of money near the end trying to make the show perfect so they had to shorten it from 28 episodes to 22 episodes. Now here is what the series is about and pardon how choppy the review is because I am trying not to reveal spoilers cause its really hard to explain what its about cause pretty much everything I have to say is spoilers

ABOUT:
This is a series about a teen named Shu who lives in a post apocalyptic world where a virus knows as the Apocalypse Virus is running rampent causing much of Japan to be quarantined while aid is constantly needed. He meets a songstress named Inori who, in a chain of events, unlocks the power of the void (which is where Shu draws out peoples hearts and uses them as weapons) to save the world

MY REVIEW:
The series is pretty much Epic. Great Music, Great Story (For their budget), Great everything. I highly recommend this anime. Even though the last part of it leaves a lot to be desired, it wasn't intentional. I still highly recommend it. It has got music by Supercell (Which is the group that helped with Hatsune Miku and Black Rock Shooter) only more awesome, has got romance, action, sy-fi, robots and pretty much everything you need to make a awesome series.",1385942400,8,1311,4.368852459016393
5741605,4,B00CU6WC8K,"Good start to the series. Art is excellent, story is solid, and while they leave some things to figure out, there is still a good bit of explanation.",1384300800,,149,4.357142857142857
5741606,5,B00CU6WC8K,"Guilty Crown
This is one of the most underrated animes I've seen, but for all the wrong reasons. This show doesn't deserve all the criticism it receives in my opinion. While certain aspects of It might seem clich, this anime still manages to conjure up complex characters and a unique (slightly dystopian) world. Combine these aspects with beautiful animation/music and the best dub I've ever heard from Funimation, and you've got one hell of a show. I highly recommend this to ALL anime fans, especially people who like Evangelion.",1384041600,,532,4.98876404494382

5741608,5,B00CU6WC8K,"This show was a lot of fun to watch. I don't get why people were talking down on it. It has great artwork from Redjuice and an amazing soundtrack by Supercell; how by the way, made music for Hatsune Miku. The show does has some clichs but all in all it's a great watch. If you're a fan of anime, I definitely recommend you pick up this title.",1382832000,,342,4.044117647058823

5741610,4,B00CU6WC8K,"Decent anime, could have been a lot better. The concept of voids is great but they didn't really realize the idea very well via the graphics. Also things like mechs are generic looking and not out of the ordinary from a design perspective.

The main complaint i have after watching the complete anime part 1&2 is the music... it just doesn't set the tone one way or the other. It's horrible singing and a portion of the theme is Inori's singing and Supercell just didn't fit the bill for me because the main theme song is just irritating especially when you have to hear it over and over again or skip the opening sequence to avoid it.

The main characters are ok, and the story develops to a fair degree but i never really felt anything strong for any one character other than Shu which makes sense, but that's a lot of focus just on the main character so the anime lacks depth for me. They toss in that guy? the blond government type attack dog blond guy so generic I forget or never remembered his name... he's in a mech, kills infected citizens like they are threatening scum to be feared and loathed but they never really flesh out his character and he just seemed like they same guy in Escaflowne, or Last Exiles Dio... they just tossed him into the mix and that's kind of how a lot of the characters come off in the anime overall.

Oh yeah, the extra art booklets are excellent with quite a few pages in the two beautiful little books. A big plus is that if you bought both part 1&2 there is enough room in the art sleeve to hold everything unlike some other collection box/art sleeves.",1381363200,2,1593,4.375

5741614,5,B00CU6WC8K,"Guilty crown may turn some off for price. But that is due to funimation dabbling in the extra stuff area. Notably this time is an art booklet. You can find these things from 15 to 30 dollars online so the price upgrade is fair.

This show is not for the happy crowd. It is done by the same people who did death note and attack on titan. People will die and you will feel their deaths. Music is solid all around. And the art is fresh and great.",1378252800,,443,4.034090909090909

5741617,4,B00CU6WC8K,"First of all, I want to say that personally, I really enjoyed this show.

I'm not sure what put people off because they all agree the first part of the show was great but the 2nd was not. I wanted to know what the fuss was about so I watched it and I must say where was the problem?? The 2nd part was more depressing but I stilled enjoyed it. In the end, I just thought people do not like watching depressing things or from what I'm hearing are upset for the mild religious context in the anime?? I really would say if you're going to argue or are easily offended about religious context like every parent does in school, do not watch this anime period.

I digress but moving on.

Personally, I recommend this anime to anyone especially if you enjoyed Code Geass, you will like this anime. Is it better than Code Geass? No. But I liked Guilty Crown in its own way. To add on, The first opening (My Dearest by Supercell) is by far one of my favorite anime openings I have seen period.",1376265600,14,983,4.218085106382978
5741618,4,B00CU6WC8K,"I'm not sure if there is a Manga regarding this show or any other sort of Media, my review for this is based only on the actual Anime, for that is all I have seen.

That being said I find people are being a bit on harsh on the reviews, at least in my opinion. To be honest the plot is doing nothing new. A military organization is trying to wipe out Japan and it's up to the resistance to fight back and keep Japan out of the clutches of this organization. It's not something new but the way the fights, the plot, and the characters are presented seemed fresh and new to me, for the most part I very much found myself enjoying the series.

The stand out here for me was the music and art. If you are a huge fan of soundtracks this is one you may not want to miss. The show does a wonderful job of setting the mood, from sad moments to some of the most epic fights the show can offer. And when it comes to over the top fights this show is not hurting at all, it has enough action to suit almost anyone needs.

When it comes to the characters themselves I found myself connection with quite a few and feeling their pain when the plot turned against them. A couple of reviews I have seen said, the characters seemed almost ""robotic"" or they changed to follow the plot. Personally I didn't see any of that at all. Sure the characters change throughout the show but it's because of traumatic events that affect them, I can't recall a single time where they changed their personality without some reason at all.

Overall I found myself enjoying this show, it's something I will watch again and I always find myself listening to the Soundtrack. I don't think this is one that should be missed. Take the show for what it is, and I think you will enjoy it.",1370563200,48,1747,4.205970149253731
5741619,2,B00CU6WC8K,"NOTHING upsets me more than lost potential, especially in a written work. So many characters and concepts left unexplored, so many opportunities missed, so many questions unanswered.

Guilty Crown's entire existence is lost potential, which probably explains why most of my time watching it either had me rolling laughing or pulling my hair out. When this thing was coming out, it was the most anticipated work of that anime season, and quickly turned into the greatest flop of both 2011 (when it started airing) and 2012 (when it stopped). That is quite the accomplishment. Don't believe me? Ask any anime blog that was covering it as it was airing.

10 years prior to the story, the Apocalypse Virus wreaked havoc on the population of Japan in a catastrophic event known as Lost Christmas (which is in no way related to Second Impact from Evangelion shut up how could you say that). Shortly after, Japan was taken over by a branch of the UN called GHQ and went under pretty much a dictatorship. The plot of the main story follows ""milk-toast Shinji Ikari clone Mk. 289"" Shu Ouma, who is dragged into a civil conflict between this overbearing big brother organization and a local group of terrorists called Funeral Parlor, led by the charismatically bland Gai Tsutsugami. He is led to this conflict by ""blank expression Rei Ayanami clone Model 562"" Inori Yuzuriha, a well known singer who for some reason has not been arrested for working with a terrorist group despite apparently making several public appearances and completing missions in an impossibly flowing dress that may as well just be there to give cosplay enthusiasts a challenge and character designers a hard-on, but otherwise has no functionality for RUNNING AWAY FROM GIANT GUARD ROBOTS. Shu also receives the ability of the Void Genome, which allows him to pull ""Voids"" out of people, which are basically physical representations of people's minds in weapon form. Does Shu have more of a connection to the events of Lost Christmas than he realizes? What are the secrets of the Voids and their connection to the Apocalypse Virus? Why is Inori so expressionless all the time? You'll be surprised how little you care by the end of the series!

Now, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of upsides in this show. The character designs, music, and animation are all fantastic, which would be fine if this were simply an artbook or a soundtrack. But this is supposed to be a story, and regrettably, the place where it falls short the most is with the plot and characters, which makes the effort put into the aforementioned GOOD aspects of the show all the more frustrating. You are not going to like ANYONE in this show by the time it is over, especially the main characters. The romance makes no sense, including main couple (remember that Shinji/Rei parallel I made? Well, subtract the actual development that pair had and fill it in with about 10x more squick), plot threads are rushed before being properly explored, side characters essentially become props (unless they end up dead, in which case they become martyrs...unless they're brought back for drama's sake), the Void thing is horribly inconsistent from person to person, and the ending leaves more awful implications than the beginning did because of how little it resolves. Besides Evangelion, it copies several other shows, along with PRETENTIOUS CHRISTIAN SYMBOLISM that serves absolutely no purpose. Nevermind that the show is shorter than the average anime shows, likely contributing to its awful pacing.

Simply put, if you're looking into a writing career and feel like a challenge as to how to fix a story that is fundamentally broken, pick this up. If you're willing to turn your brain off and just enjoy the visuals and music, give it a go. But if you're critically minded in ANY WAY AT ALL, avoid, avoid, avoid.",1369785600,25,3845,4.892638036809816

8586386,3,B00CU6WC8K,"Just finished this serious on Funimations and felt compelled to voice my confusion somewhere. This series started kinda cool, a crystalizing virus plagues Japan and the government starts using heavy handed tactics to control it. The first half had some nice things and storylines.

Then about episode 12 or so it just devolves into this weird mish mash of ""huh""? The main character ""Shu"" turns into a tyrant for a few weird, dragging episodes derailing the whole plot. Then the whole virus thing is confounded by being the beginning of a ""new humanity"" or something. I lost interest by episode 15 and just soldiered on in an effort to complete it. I am really not sure how this series has dang near 5 stars on here.

I'd say if you really feel compelled to watch this, don't waste your money on buying the discs just get a trial of funimation and feel baffled midway through.

The one saving grace is the animation is really nice. Fight scenes are cool and character designs are attractive. Though not 100% sure why anime always has characters that are barely through puberty and almost always feature some sort of high school setting. Are they trying to relive their youth or something?",1448150400,,1187,4.72463768115942
