8208560,5,B000TBT218,"This is a must see for fans of Lance Henriksen. Besides the Millennium series this is my favorite. A super sexy psychological thriller.  I've watched it over and over.  Henriksen gives a mesmerizing performance  combining mystery, menace,vulnerabilty, hidden sensitivity and uninhibited  primal sensuality. He is a master of complex characters when given the  chance.  Can't imagine why this was not released to the theaters.  Strong  cast.",947980800,5,440,5.5606060606060606
