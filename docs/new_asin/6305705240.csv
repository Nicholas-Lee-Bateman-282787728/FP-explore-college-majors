7893828,1,6305705240,Dude as an avid Rage fan I thought this would be a good addition to my collection.. i was surely mistaken. NO music. No Band Members. Its people talking about the music and not even cool people. Save your money please do it for the kids,1204070400,,236,4.1521739130434785
7893829,1,6305705240,"It's only a documentary, people talking about them and nothing else, there's no music. Son think before do anything in only you like the music.",986342400,23,143,4.76
7893830,1,6305705240,This DVD is basically an interview with people who are Rage fans.  No Music.  No concert footage.  There is less than 1 minute of an interview with Tom Morello.  That's it.  No Zack.  No Brad.  No YTimK.  Definitely  not worth the price.,962496000,62,237,4.4523809523809526
