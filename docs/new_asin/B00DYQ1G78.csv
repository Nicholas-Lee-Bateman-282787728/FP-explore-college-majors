They did a great job in reducing size of same and it is in a neat package.  The series speaks for itself and if you are reading my review than you already know about the series itself.  Lets put it this way, it is priced right and will not last forever.  There are bonus features and so forth, but my wife and I really love watching Magnum and all of the cast in action.  I would strongly  recommend this set.  Great job Universal.",1384646400,102,564,3.8859649122807016

5879136,5,B00DYQ1G78,"I won't bother to explain the series as everybody knows the story of Magnum and his friends... the question is what if anything is different about this complete set from the individual seasons many of us own or bought.....

This is an excellent set which improves some of the seasons where the notorious ""flipper"" discs were originally pressed by Universal. These seasons all feature single sided Dual Layer discs for better operating without the ""freezing"" associated with double sided flippers. The entire set (all seasons and bonus features/episodes) takes up far less space than the original sets.  NO updating on the image has taken place ,we get the same quality of image which is pretty good at best,  but it was a terrific series and Magnum PI remains the most popular Private Eye/Detective in TV history.
I found this at Costco for 99.99 so that is where I purchased and would recommend looking for that as the standard of good pricing as of this writing (November 1st)",1383264000,200,978,4.844311377245509
5879137,5,B00DYQ1G78,"This was always a fun show to watch, and now I can have all the episodes for just a bit more than a month's cost of cable or satellite! They do sometimes air these on cable/satellite channels, but riddled with commercials and the pesky network logo that is always in the lower right corner of the screen. Now I can enjoy this free of these annoyances! Yes, I dropped ALL cable/satellite services and I am using the money I save to buy my favorite shows on DVD or BluRay.
I look forward to adding more classic shows to my collection like this!",1381449600,60,542,4.323529411764706

I am giving four stars for the series itself. The service from Westcoastmedia was spot on. The product (Magnum p.i. The complete series) was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition and on time.
I didn't get to see the Magnum series when it was playing, and I occasionally saw pieces of an episode here or there when it was re-running. Now that I am watching the complete series, it seems a little dated to me. The show is more comedy than I expected, but I am still enjoying it.

5879159,4,B00DYQ1G78,I loved this show very much but when it started I assumed the original theme to Magnum PI might not have been done at production time since it didn't play it on the first disc I tried.  Then I got real disappointed when I found out the theme song isn't even on any of the episodes which turned me off of wanting to watch them.  I definitely won't try and do that again when buying original old TV series.  What a bummer!,1524268800,,420,4.097560975609756

5879187,2,B00DYQ1G78,"Both my husband and I watched Magnum when we were much much younger and enjoyed the show - so thought we would enjoy it now.  Wrong!  One forget what the 80s TV shows were like - mundane dialogue, hokey situations, and above all we now understand why Tom Selleck was accused back then of being gay.....they keep him in very short tight shorts and he prances and twirls; it's not the Tom Selleck we remember as rough and a bit gruff, not the Tom Selleck cowboy Monte, certainly not the police commissioner on Blue Bloods.  Magnum PI has a high-pitched whiny voice with a forced cackle to the point we can't stand him,.... and I'm a big fan of this actor.  So what do we do?  We put these DVDs on in the bedroom when we want to go to sleep -- and it always works within one episode (1/2 hr)  So we gave it two stars for the ability to put us to sleep.",1511136000,,849,4.115151515151515

Tom Selleck has an iconic acting career, but he'll forever be remembered as Thomas Magnum, along with his fellow cohorts on the Hawaiian islands as they fought crime in the '80s.
That said, the DVDs came in a box containing 8 cases, each with a season. Thankfully the DVDs are now one sided, unlike the ones you might've previously gotten or seen.

BUT in their heavy-handed effort to re-write history and take retroactive credit for the production of the series, Comcast felt it necessary to re-do the Universal Studios signature ID.  So the end credits and the theme music are crudely chopped off where the original Universal ID was.  There's now 5-seconds of dead silence and a blank screen before the new Universal Studios ID is shown.  Just annoying, right?

Yes, BUT . . . in Season 3's eleventh show ""Heal Thyself"", this clumsy work also destroyed something more important.  It took away a finaland to manyhealing message that appeared on screen.  As I remember it, It was a dedication of the program to the thousands of Nurses and other medical personnel who also served in Vietnam, who also suffered from PTSD, who also have memories they don't want to face.

5879221,3,B00DYQ1G78,"This Old School private detective drama of Donald Bellisario's that ran on CBS from 1980-88 takes me back to memory lane to when I watched it as a kid every Thursday night before SIMON & SIMON along with the fact that MAGNUM was what made Tom Selleck famous and made him a sex symbol.

I always got a kick out of Thomas Magnum  (Tom Selleck) always having a fallout with his Navy buddies, TC  (Roger Mosley), and Rick "" Orville "" Wright  (Larry Manetti), and with the often disgruntled, Jonathan Higgins  (John Hillerman), especially since Magnum lived on a shoe-string budget, rent-free at a semi-swanky estate in Oahu, with unlimited use of the famous, never shown Robin Masters Ferrari.

MAGNUM also inspired the creation of SIMON & SIMON and MATT HOUSTON in the 80's along with the fact that ROCKFORD FILES inspired the creation of MAGNUM, P.I.; after Tom Selleck guest starred a couple of times on Rockford as the seemingly flawless private dick, (Lance White) in the episodes "" White On White & Nearly Perfect "" back in the Autumn of 1978 and "" Nice Guys Finish Dead "" in the Autumn of 1979.",1497744000,,1097,4.6

Always taking away things from magnum. Forwarding the idea the he was robin masters. Enough! Kathleen lloyd. Why didn't  magnum run as soonas she appeared? Bad news. Also,  killing off jeff mckay in one role and then bringing back as a con man. Should have left that plot line alone. Also, Kathleen Lloyd is very annoying in any role I have seen her in. Also, 2 questions: 1: which (wars) did Higgins serve in, 2. If Higgins knows martial arts, ( from the opening credits) , why didn't use them during the series?

The DVD's are not re-mastered but they are better quality than TV was in the 1980's.  I looked up some Magnum Websites that contain episode lists, trivia, and short scenarios of each show.  The DVD's are arranged in order of season.  Each plastic case holds one season with DVD's in a book type layout.  They vary regarding the amount of episodes each DVD contains.  Each DVD menu tells the episodes it contains and has them laid out in order of original air date.  They all fit neatly in the durable cardboard case.

5879324,3,B00DYQ1G78,"Note: This review focuses on the DVD set, not the series.  I love the series or I would not have purchased the set.  This is an updated, complete review.  Previously, I had written a starter review to pass on information I felt was important.  I have now finished watching the entire series on DVD.

The DVDs are single sided (some original releases were double sided, but in 2012, the series was re-released with single-sided disks).  The picture and audio are just fine and the shows are fun to watch again.  However, if you are someone like me who likes to watch the ending credits, you'll notice something very strange about them.  The music does not come to an end.  It plays on and on.  The credits cut off at various points.  At least one show did not even get through the first third of the credits.  Others stopped halfway and some do get to the end, but it's not a definitive end like you see when watching Magnum on the Encore Channel or when it aired originally on TV.  Oftentimes, there is a strange blackness of a few seconds between the last picture to appear and the Universal logo.  Universal has actually acknowledged that a mistake was made, but noted that it is unlikely to be corrected.  This situation occurs on the majority of seasons, but not all as the last couple of seasons appear to be mostly fine. Thus, enjoy the show, but if you like watching the end credits, be prepared for this unusual situation.

Also, Season 3, Disk 2, ""Foiled Again"" episode has a defect in the beginning voice over for chapter 4.  Magnum begins to speak and then it skips forward.  I'll have to watch the episode on Encore to remind myself what all Magnum said during this intro to the next scene.  This was the only skip on my disks, though there were two very brief disk pauses on two other DVDs in the set.  These do not affect the enjoyment of the shows in my opinion.  They are very quick, short delays of an extra second or two.

There are some extras, but overall, I found them to be limited and disappointing.  There were three bonused episodes from other series.  One was for an episode of The A-Team and I actually loved the one they chose because it featured Kristen Meadows, a favorite actress of mine.  Another was an episode of The Knight Rider.  Neither has a tie-in to the Magnum series.  Finally, there was an episode of The Rockford Files on which Tom Selleck appeared in a couple of shows.  The episode on the DVD is one of Selleck's shows, White on White and Nearly Perfect.  Earlier season sets have a bonus of a Magnum episode from the next season.  I suppose that was exciting when the sets were first released, but for a complete series set, these bonus episodes are unnecessary and not worth much.

The best extra was probably a six-minute featurette on the crossover that was done between Magnum, PI and Murder She Wrote.  There are three commentaries on episodes from season 8, but none include any of the actors.  Two are with a writer and the other is with a co-producer.  They had some interesting tidbits, but tended to veer to talk about the show as a whole instead of including some of the specific tidbits that I like to hear in commentaries.  There's also a promotional show done on the Sleuth Channel when it began.  It focused on the top ten detective shows as voted on by fans.  The other extra is a featurette on 80's TV shows.

The 8 season sets come in a nice cardboard box for keeping.  Each set is a digipak, book-like plastic case.  Each DVD has its own 'book leaf' to rest securely in the plastic case.  The DVDs are all basic with the name of the series and the disk number of the season imprinted on it.  There is no artwork on the DVDs, even though I read on the Magnum Mania site that Season 5 when first released did have individual artwork of the stars on each DVD.

Originally, my 3-star rating is based on the issue with the ending credits and the defect.  I had thought I would up it after seeing the extras in the set, but I'm leaving it.  The extras just were not that exciting, but what bothers me most relates back to the problem with the ending credits.  Universal pulled mostly syndicated copies of these shows and not the original masters that were first broadcast on TV.  There are actually bits of show not included in some episodes on the DVD.  These shows are not cut to bits, as in edited for more commercials, but there are a few moments that do not appear for one reason or another.  You can read more of the details on the Magnum Mania website.  More differences from original broadcast and the DVD versions:  1) The syndicated wrap up version of the Simon and Simon cross over episode (Ki'i's Don't Lie) is used so that they did not need to include the Simon and Simon episode (Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend).  Interestingly, the Simon and Simon complete set does include the broadcast version, including the Magnum episode as a bonus in its set.  2) The Murder By Night episode that was originally broadcast in mostly black and white is a syndicated version with most of the episode in color.

Even with all I've written that are cons about the set, I don't think it should stop fans from buying the set when the set is priced appropriately.  The show was a good one and a better set is unlikely to come along at this stage of the game.  The few omissions are not that crucial to the overall enjoyment.  Though the cons bug me, I am still glad I now own the set.",1452729600,50,5446,4.417085427135678

SOOOO much better than 99.9% of today's tv shows, and one you can actually watch with your family without worrying about the filthy content that is present on so many of today's programs. This set was priced at $95, then netflix took it off their streaming and Amazon raised the price $20 in the next 2 days, so that wasn't very cool, but still well worth the money spent.

Out of all the disks, I only experienced 2 that had a temporary problem with freezing or skipping. After cleaning them to buff out the scuff marks, I have not experienced anymore problems.
  I like this set. The shows are as I remembered them on T.V.  The menus are simple with either playing the whole disk or playing each episode by choice. Each episode has it's own description on the screen.  Some disks have Bonus Episodes from other shows such as from Knight Rider and The A-Team. The quality of the picture and sound is fair. Being older T.V. shows, I didn't expect HD.  I would of given this set 5 Stars, but with the imperfections of the disks, I gave it 4.  Hopefully, other buyers won't have the same problems or any other problems, because it's a great DVD collection  for any Magnum P.I. fan.",1438905600,,1063,4.415384615384616

That being said, this was one of the better detective series ever on TV, and it was one of the starting places for the Belisario franchise, that's worked it's way up through J.A.G. and the three N.C.I.S. franchises.  Matter of fact, you will see some of the same actors in Magnum in bit parts that showed up regularly in the later series.  Magnum is generally treated with a light touch, but the story lines were generally good, there was plenty of drama, and just occasionally, Selleck took the opportunity in Magnum to show a more serious side.  It's a good price, especially if you've wanted the series and didn't want to pay the piecemeal prices at re-sale shops.",1417305600,5,780,4.671532846715328

5879475,4,B00DYQ1G78,"Appears to be the same mastering as the single series collection, but I picked it up anyway as a Deal of the Day or Deal of the Week.  I am giving the single series to my son.  The one thing I'll say for it is that it takes up less room, which is always a good thing.  Plus, I just like owning these complete series packages.  I have wised up and rarely buy single series now, knowing sooner or later they'll come out with something like this.  Same thing with Hawaii Five-O (the Jack Lord version).  Wisely I had not bought those individual seasons.  There are some bonus features in this set that I honestly don't recall if any of them were or were not included with any of the single-season offerings.
Just as an aside, it is very disappointing that Selleck and company never did any sort of reunion movie.  That would have been entertaining or at least nostalgic.  I suppose it's never too late, but somehow Magnum as a 70-year-old wouldn't quite cut it.  The regulars are all still with us, although John Hillerman (Higgins) is in his 80's and doesn't appear to have acted in quite a while.  I digress.
Bottom line, If you are a fan of the series and don't own all the individual seasons, or wish to consolidate as I did, then pick this set up, especially if it shows back up as a Deal of the Day or Deal of the Week.",1413590400,4,1322,4.269076305220883

5879535,3,B00DYQ1G78,"If you collected the individual DVDs then ""The Complete Series"" is a waste since the series is just a packaging of individual DVDs cases. The DVDs aren't remastered either.

The video aspect is TV - 1.33, the DVDs are single sided.

English subtitles is selectable.

The quality of the video may vary a bit from episode to episode (crispness, graininess), and may even within the episode itself - usually when episode starts.

The DVD casing is mixed- about 7 tabs holding DVDs were found broken off, and the plastic holding at least 4 swivel DVD holder were found broken. There is title and a description provided on the DVD case insert. There is no title or description on the DVD itself.

Too bad extras weren't added since the actors are alive - shame on Universal. In Miss Marple of Geraldine McEwan Series there are cast interviews and behind the scenes extras which added value to the series.",1403654400,11,899,4.7006369426751595

* Every disc is single-sided, as opposed to so many series that opt for double-sided.

* Every disc was 100% free of any scuffs or scratches.
* The box that holds the eight seasons is sturdy and features great graphics of Tom Selleck and the rest of the cast

I am pretty strict when it comes to these reviews. If something isn't good, I'm not shy about saying so, but this Magnum PI box set is just perfect.

No flipper disks.  However, it is basically the same sets.  There are no special features or bonus materials that are not on the individual seasons.  For example, season three has a bonus for an episode of season four.  Really?  Why not include the cross over episodes from Murder She Wrote and Simon & Simon???
