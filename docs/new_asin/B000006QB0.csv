7904604,3,B000006QB0,"This is EXACTLY the same tape as the History Channel's ""In Search of History: Roman Legions."" Don't be fooled because it has a different title and different ISBN; they are identical, down to a verbatim narrative and pictures. It is a basic, informative presentation on the Roman legions, but it is NOT, as the title implies, about the lost legions (think Teutoburgerwald or Carrhae here). Enjoy it, but don't be confused.",978393600,11,421,4.943661971830986
