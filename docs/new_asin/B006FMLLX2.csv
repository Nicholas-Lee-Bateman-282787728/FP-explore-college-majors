4985144,5,B006FMLLX2,"This is a positive way to help influence my daughter to not lose her healthy physical image (without the overdone sensual influence of so many other attractive female artists in the music industry) especially for the teen years; every single member of the ""Girls Aloud"" vocal group is healthy and beautiful in their appearance, physically and facially, they have a close emotional bond with each other (like sisters who really care for, and protect, each other), the songs are sung in a pleasant vocal style that is acceptable for all ages with no bad language within the lyrics, and the songs are easy to learn and good to dance to for exercise.
Even though some of the videos might not make sense in the relationship to the lyrics, the videos are just fun and entertaining to watch because the songs match up to the familiar songs from their concerts; the vocal talent of each member is also what is included as one of the main preferences to my daughter and my choice for this vocal group DVD.",1362441600,10,996,4.632768361581921
