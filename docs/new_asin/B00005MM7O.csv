Phillip Kuo(MA-Tee) and John Liu( The Wanderer) put on an Exhibtion  of Entertaining Kung-fu I saw this  movie 7 times when it Originally came  to the Theathers in New York 42nd St. I did not see it again until 14yrs  later and it still gives me the same sensation that it did in 84. The only  Bad thing  about the Movie is that Dragon(no Talent )Lee Is one of the  stars, other than that,Every fan of Hong Kong Kung-fu Movies should own a  copy of this .",940723200,,597,3.957983193277311

7946086,1,B00005MM7O,"I wanted to hear the Wu Tang samples unfortunately there were no wu-tang samples in this video, so if you're like me and that's why you're buying this movie don't do it! Also, overall the movie is garbage.  I love old cheesy kung fu movies but this is absolute crap. Consider yourself warned. It's a complete waste of money.",1382659200,,324,4.491525423728813
7946087,4,B00005MM7O,"Dragon on Fire...Quality of film to dvd transfer very good, but the shots are to tight.  In some scenes people are talking off camera.  Audio okay, overall, a very good film.  Dragon Lee is all action and fine Kung-Fu style.  There are other films with similar titles to this, but only one Dragon Lee.

7946089,5,B00005MM7O,"Nice to get this movie on DVD.There are no extras with it, but the quality is good. Well worth it if you're a true martial arts movie fan, especially a fan of John Liu. Unfortunately, there are a couple of annoying characters in this one, but the heroes make up for it, and the fight scenes are great. This has been one of my favorites for years.",1125705600,,346,4.17910447761194
7946090,1,B00005MM7O,"I'm not sure why people have given this film such good reviews.  Maybe it's one of the reasons why I disliked it even more.  I was expecting a film with great fighting, even without the good storyline, but I was very disappointed.  My main beef with this film is the way Godfrey Ho manipulates the speed of the fighting sequences.  I think he should have just undercranked to make it look like they were fighting faster.  Instead, he snips out frames, so for example, at one second, a guys hands at his waist, while in the next instance it's above his head!  Not to mention the fact that the coreography itself isn't memorable.  Philip Ko is a great fighter (at least, he is in other films I've seen, like 'Tiger Over Wall'), but boy is wasted in this film.  Tino Wong and John Liu are also not impressive in this film.  And what's up with Dragon Lee?  His character goes around making bruce lee faces and manneurisms, but what is the point of his character?  I guess one interesting fact about this film is that it features some 'voodoo kung fu', which would become a popular genre during the early 80's.
If you really are curious about this film, I'd suggest getting it as a cheapie in that 'Dragon Lee' set by BCI Eclipse/Brentwood.  At least, if you dislike it, you won't have wasted your money, and if you really liked it, you'd feel satisfied about getting your money's worth and more.",1056931200,2,1391,4.476190476190476
7946091,5,B00005MM7O,"This movie called, ""Dragon on Fire"" is the TITEST MOVIE in the whole WIDE WORLD!  I'd give it 10 STARS for the highest scale!
I really admire Dragon Lee in this movie!  He is my IDOL!  He is my MOST favorite actor of all time!  Lots of awesome fighting sequences makes this movie ROCK the WORLD!  I like the way he wastes the gang members!  The movie makes me keep my eyes stuck to the television screen for hours!  The movie is very addicing to watch!  I can watch it over and over like many times and still not get used to it!  Dragon Lee's fighting sequences are EXTREMELY EXTRAORDINARY!  The VERY BEST BRUCE LEE IMPERSONATOR!  This is a very must see movie for all Dragon Lee/Bruce Lee fans!
I really love it when Dragon Lee turns villains and enemies on FIRE every time he kicks and punches them plus he also uses Bruce Lee's nunchucks!  That makes people on fire, too!  Lots of blood makes this movie an AWESOME MARTIAL ARTS THRILLER!  I think Dragon Lee is at his very best performance on screen!  His fighting keeps me mesmerized forever!  I think Dragon Lee's fighting is a lot better than Bruce Lee!  He is a total awesome international star for the whole world to see!",1047427200,4,1179,4.3842592592592595
7946092,4,B00005MM7O,"Two men enemies by blood, forced to be partners is battle.  Trained in complimenting styles they come together in order to kill the master of many styles.  Can they work together, or are there hidden ogendas?  Some of the best fights you'll see. Phillip Kao, John Liu, Wilson Tong, and Dragon Lee star in this definite classic.",978566400,3,327,4.701754385964913
7946093,3,B00005MM7O,"I purchased this video because of all the credit it recieved in the review section. But, when I watched it I was saying, ""What the hell is going on?"". The movie brought in characters with out providing a  introduction, and it jumps from scene to scene. I have to admit the  fighting scenes where good, especially the awesome leg fighter. But due to  the lack of a developed story, which leaves you in confusion, I found this  movie a little bit boring. Although, if you just like to watch fight  scenes, I recommend it because there is a ton of them!",948067200,,550,4.405940594059406
7946094,5,B00005MM7O,I am a big fan and collect martial art movies. I first saw this movie in New York around 1980 or 1981.  I saw this movie about 5 times.  Phillip (Kao Fei) is the baddest bad guy EVER!  He is the best in every movie he's  in even on the asian soap operas I tune in.  John Liu is amazing.  Those 2  put on the best end of the film action EVER! I had to buy this movie for my  collection and I still watch it at least 2 or 3 times a week and sometimes  I skip to the end just to see Phillip and John.  This is a classic movie.  I wish they would restore it fully uncut and put it on DVD.  I'd be the  first in line to buy it.  (Now if they could just delete Dragon Lee from it  the better) Sorry Dragon Lee too much emphasism on Bruce Lee.  Let the man  rest in peace.,947548800,3,765,3.652173913043478
