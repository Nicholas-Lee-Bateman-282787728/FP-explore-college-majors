8615076,4,B00FF146JU,"I am a huge fan of ""Peanuts"" and particularly Charlie Brown. I was really excited to see that there was a new ""Peanuts"" DVD that had been released: TOUCHDOWN CHARLIE BROWN! Since this was released around the time of the Super Bowl 2014, I thought that it might include the tv special, YOU'RE IN THE SUPERBOWL, CHARLIE BROWN which hasn't been released on anything except for VHS back around 1993. Sadly, that wasn't the case. Instead, TOUCHDOWN CHARLIE BROWN! is a DVD that contains the tv special IT'S YOUR FIRST KISS, CHARLIE BROWN and episodes 3, 10, and 12 of the CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW. I really like IT'S YOUR FIRST KISS, CHARLIE BROWN. It's a special where Charlie Brown plays an important part in the homecoming football game and then that evening has to escort the queen and give her a kiss at the big dance. Of course, the queen is none other than the little red haired girl. I also liked all of the episodes of THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW. There's a segment on episode 3 entitled ""Football"" that ties into the ""touchdown"" theme of the DVD. However, that's about it. Even though I like all of these specials and episodes, I'm disappointed that TOUCHDOWN CHARLIE BROWN! doesn't contain any new material. I already own IT'S YOUR FIRST KISS, CHARLIE BROWN on the BE MY VALENTINE, CHARLIE BROWN DVD and THE PEANUTS 1970S COLLECTION, VOL. 2. I also own the CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW COMPLETE SERIES, so I already have the episodes that are on this DVD. There aren't very many bad ""Peanuts"" specials, so one can't complain about the quality of the material on TOUCHDOWN CHARLIE BROWN! However, there are at least eight ""Peanuts"" specials that have never been released on DVD that I don't understand why Warner Brothers Home Video doesn't get the material out to the public. Overall, TOUCHDOWN CHARLIE BROWN is a good special with some nice episodes of THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW on it. However, if you've already purchased all the ""Peanuts"" DVDs released so far, you'll want to skip this one because there is absolutely no new material on it (other than some promos of Scooby-Doo cartoons).",1392422400,26,2117,4.708894878706199
