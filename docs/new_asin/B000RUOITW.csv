8202551,5,B000RUOITW,Works perfectly as an ambient background video. It's also a nice alternative to the more typical autumn-leaves themes. I just wish the loop were longer.,1506643200,,152,5.12
8202552,5,B000RUOITW,"What a wonderful program, beautifully photographed and perfect music! This was just what I was looking for as a backdrop for our Thanksgiving gathering!",1443052800,,152,5.375
8202553,1,B000RUOITW,"The only other videos of this type I have purchased were ""A Currier and Ive's Christmas"" and a Christmas across America type of thing.  I, therefore, thought this dvd would follow suit.  However was very disappointed.  The music was serene as was the visual.  However, there wasn't much of it.  Just the same few scenes over and over.  Rather boring all in all.",1196812800,8,361,4.650793650793651
