8451983,4,B0050WM0Y2,"I saw ""The Big Gamble"" on the bottom of a double-bill with ""Seven Women From Hell"" when they first-ran in our town in 1961. And, as much as I enjoyed seeing the film again on this dvd, sadly, this is not the original CinemaScope version, but a 4x3 pan&scan which crops off the edges of the picture. In widescreen, ""The Big Gamble"" was really something to see - sort of a low-rent remake of ""Wages of Fear."" Sad.",1470441600,4,411,4.282051282051282
8451984,4,B0050WM0Y2,"This is a one terrific little movie from 1961 starring Stephen Boyd, David Wayne and the breathtaking Juliette Greco. This DVD version is from Spain and unfortunately is flat full frame from a Cinemascope original. I'm also pretty sure a few minutes are missing, but the suspenseful action sequences of transporting a loaded truck over the mountains and plains of Africa is exciting at every turn. Sadly, this appears to be the only version available, but it's still quite good. Rousing music score by a pre-LAWRENCE OF ARABIA Maurice Jarre.",1402617600,2,541,5.022222222222222
8451985,3,B0050WM0Y2,"I am highly disappointed with this DVD edition, made by Impulso for 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, in Spain. The transfer of this wide-screen film loses most of its sense of adventure and action with the full-frame format, slightly elongated images, and completely altered composition. If you already know ""The Big Gamble"", avoid this Spanish edition. Maybe those who have never seen it, may want to take a look.",1314921600,5,418,5.072463768115942
