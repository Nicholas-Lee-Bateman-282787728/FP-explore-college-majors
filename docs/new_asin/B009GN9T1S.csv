8541322,3,B009GN9T1S,"The plot isn't too much of a mystery. A group of adults are being tortured and killed by a vigilante group because they bullied a couple of kids in the sixth grade. They are forced to play an adult version of the X-game which is more torturous than the one as a child. Do they have sixth grade reunions in Japan?

For those who like a two hour creepy ""Saw"" type of film, this is it. They did a sequel to this film, I'll think I'll pass for now.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.  English subtitles.",1450915200,,501,4.144329896907217
8541323,4,B009GN9T1S,"X Games was  more of a story driven film than a gore fest although there were very brutal scenes of violence and some gore. It's a little uneven in places and very far fetched but still quite entertaining.

We never really know all of the participants in the revenge or exactly who did what to whom until the end of the film.

There are some very tense, uncomfortable moments and lots of blood but nothing that ever takes it to torture porn status. I would definitely recommend it to lovers of Asian extreme films or people that don't mind reading subtitles .",1426118400,,559,4.46078431372549
8541324,5,B009GN9T1S,"I loved te gore factor of this movie. You just sat back and waited for the next thing to happen and slightly freak you out. I especially like that there are not one, but two surprise twists that I did not see coming towards the end of the film. I highly recommend this dvd. To those who are still not sure, check out the trailer for it on youtube first. It helps to be informed.",1405728000,,378,4.053333333333334
8541325,3,B009GN9T1S,"X Game (Yhei Fukuda, 2010)

First off: X Game is not a movie about extreme snowboarding or anything along those lines. Here's a hypothesis for you, and I rush to add I'm pulling this solely from my memory and have done no research on it whatsoever: there's a slasher-film subgenre that arose in southeast Asia a few years back, got extremely popular, and then faded just as quickly into obscurity that seems to center around high schools. (I'm going to step a little farther out on this limb and suggest that it might have been spawned by the enduring popularity of the Ghost School [Yeogo Goedam] trilogy from KoreaWhispering Corridors, Memento Mori, and Wishing Stairsthat has since spawned a number of equally successfully sequels, including the phenomenal Voice.) I can think off the top of my head of a half-dozen or so movies that fit the bill, all Japanese and all released, if memory serves, between 2007 and 2010, I've seen along these lines. X Game is the most recent one to cross my eyes. It's not the best of the lot by any means (the aforementioned Voice pretty much, if you'll pardon the pun, rules that school), but it's not the worst, either.

Plot: A primary school teacher becomes an Internet sensation after his gory suicide is released on Youtube. The next day, the alumni from one of his classes, all of whom must have been drugged in some way, awaken in their old classroom and, after some rather painful prodding, agree to take part in X Game, a series of torture exercises that take the tactics the students used, while they were in this class some years back, to bully a classmate named Mariko. I'm sure you can see where this is going.

X Game never strays from formula, which pretty much by definition means you're not going to get the same kinds of pleasant surprises one finds when one stumbles upon a movie like Voice, Dek Hor (released in English-speaking countries as Dorm), or Say My Name 3x. On the other hand, Fukuda has a sense of pace that some of his contemporaries lack, which makes the film feel like a better option for spending one's time than some of the other flicks that reside in this subgenre (Gosa, Art of the Devil II, Du Saram-yida if you turn your head and squint right). In other words, you don't need to go out of your way to score a copy, but if you stumble upon it on Netflix Instant sometime and you like that sort of thing, you could certainly do worse. Predictable and not terribly inspiring, but kind of fun. ** ",1382140800,,2471,4.546067415730337
8541326,4,B009GN9T1S,X-Game is another entry in the J-Horror category. The flick has an interesting plot about a secret society who take revenge on people who are bullys. But what really sets this flick apart from other J-Horror films are the torture scenes. Only the Japanese can come up with this kind crazy stuff.,1368230400,,295,4.6923076923076925
8541327,4,B009GN9T1S,"X-Game follows Hideaki and three of his 6th grade classmates as they are kidnapped and forced to play the X-Games- the torturous games that this class created long ago to hurt and humiliate a young girl, Mariko. I viewed this on Netflix Streaming (on 12/23/12) where it is titled ""Death Tube"" and has a different description. This is a brutal game, and basically a blend of Saw and Hostel, which isn't a bad thing in this case.

The story is X-Game is basically a revenge tale; a brutally bullied girl forces her attackers to play much more violent version of the game they created. They have a secret organization that captures these bullies and sets them up for their clients- like Hostel. And the purpose is to teach them a lesson on their previous actions/lifestyles- like Saw. A wheel chooses which bully gets gets tortured, and the torturing is administered by the non-chosen bullies; if they don't complete the task, one is randomly chosen to get branded with a large X. The torture in this film doesn't solely rely on gore, although some does; for example, one game forces one victim to sit on a chair full of spikes and barbed wire, another has a victim chug a ridiculous amount of milk, and a challenge has them burn the hair of another. It does have a lot of violence and has plenty of twists at the end- some are predictable, while others are not. It is, however, very long, starts off slow, and a bit confusing towards the end. The acting was decent, and I enjoyed the music (some of it reminded me of ""Dead Silence"").

Overall, X-Game is a brutal game of revenge, with a twisted storyline. As I previously stated, as of 12/23/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming under the title ""Death Tube"" with a different description: if you can't find it, they probably fixed the issue and changed the name back to ""X-Game"", regardless, it's on there. Worth a purchase for torture and some horror fans, a rental or stream otherwise.

X-Games has very strong blood and violence (including some children bullying), no sex or nudity.",1356220800,,2043,4.653739612188366
