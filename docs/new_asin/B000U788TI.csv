8212216,4,B000U788TI,"Very good techniques, and easy to learn instructions.
I started watching and practicing these simple and effective techniques with my 12 year old son and 10 year old daughter, and they not only picked up the self defense moves very easily, but the enjoyed learning it. ( I think they just liked ""submitting their old man."" I found most of the move effective even against an unsuspecting adult man. Very good. Next my wife and daughter are going to study and learn the ""Live to Tell"" woman's defense next, and the Tae bo set for great exercise.",1358899200,,543,4.608247422680412
8212217,5,B000U788TI,Bully 911 addresses the realistic yet overlooked reality of violence between children. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has a child or works with children. I also think this would translate well into a program or siminar for kids to take at a Martial arts school.,1222560000,,272,4.6875
8212218,5,B000U788TI,"My nine year old niece watched this video with her aunt and grandmother and soon they were all practicing the simple, but effective, techniques with confidence and proficiency. Bullying is a real world issue. Don't think it can't or isn't happening to your kid--because they're not likely to tell you even if it is. The information is presented in a casual, matter-of-fact manner that encourages kids rather than scares them. Buy this for your kid or a loved one and watch it with them...BEFORE they need it.",1219795200,2,508,4.850574712643678
8212219,2,B000U788TI,"Probably best for the single parent mother trying to raise a boy, we start from the premise that you want to run first, then talk, then defend yourself.  Unfortunately there is little evidence that running will do more than encourage a bully and talk is nice in theory but I never saw it work other than as a diversion.  The escape techniques are excellent and there is no information which could offend even the person soft as baby poop.  Personally I suggest a more direct approach, but in some situations this would be balanced.  I find a frightening lack of realism about the school yard where kids today may be armed, or junkies or both.  Kids must understand that even the LEO will avoid confrontation with an armed junkie until there are reinforcements.
Overall, I would strongly recommend it where Dad can sit down with son and/or daughter while watching it and discuss family philosophy about violence viewed from the oppressed and as viewed by the oppressor.",1212105600,3,968,4.772455089820359
