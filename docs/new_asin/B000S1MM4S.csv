It has encouraged some of my younger children to read the books based on this series as well. Get it, keep it, all ages. Because long ago, in a distant land...",1214438400,,330,4.015151515151516

From tragedy to comedy, and everything in between, all genres are covered in impeccable style. Right from the start the tales are inspired, but by season 3 it really hits its stride and never lets up. Just buy it!!!",1209427200,2,302,4.611111111111111

It's an amazing series without a doubt, but as of 3.11.2008, the price is over $100 for the 4 season set. One poster noted that if you buy all seasons separately, you'll only pay $85.

I want to point out further that if you buy the Set that includes Seasons 1-3 for $53.99 and then buy season 4 separately for $14.99, you spend a little over $65, which is $35 cheeper than the combined set that includes the same episodes.

This may change soon and this review will become irrelevant, but remember to always comparison shop.",1205193600,20,535,4.505154639175258
2878792,5,B000S1MM4S,"I want this set !! 5 Stars.

But I was doing the math.  If I buy Season 1 (2 Discs) = ~$18; Season 2 (2 discs)=~$18; Season 3(2 disks)=~$23; Season 4 (2 disks)=~$23. (As of Oct 07).  Total cost for seasons 1-4 (8 disks) is ~$84.

BUT if I buy This new Seasons 1-4 Set (Same 8 Disks), it costs ~$100.  hmmmmmm.....

Will keep this in my wishlist until someone at Amazon doublechecks their math, and adjust to ~$80 (or less?)

2878793,5,B000S1MM4S,"Samurai Jack is Mr. Tartakovsky's masterpiece, although I think Dexter and the PPGirls are quite brilliant as well, and he might produce even greater stuff.. According to 'Making Toons', Mr. Tartakovsky was given free reign by Cartoon Network after Dexter's success, and Samurai Jack was the result. It is extremely original both in the story department and in the art direction. Its unconventional in its snappy animation and its cinematography. It's really action-packed and full of weird fantasy stuff and funny surreal characters. In short, It's one of the pinnacles of 2D animation. One can hardly live without it ;)",1191542400,9,621,5.22

All of the episodes are here, it's my understanding not all of them made it to air. The quality is very good, they are not in HD aspect ratio but that is how the series was produced. It looks fantastic on my 50"" TV. Of particular value are the features - interviews and biographies of the team that created this beautiful animated series. It's not entirely for kids, some of the content is a little dark. If you are looking to buy this you probably know that.

2878813,5,B000S1MM4S,"""Samurai Jack"", in this critic's honest opinion, is the fourth greatest action cartoon of all time (and its fifth season revival on Adult Swim certainly helps). The only ones I consider better than it are (in order) ""Gargoyles"", ""Avatar TLA"", and ""Batman TAS"". I also say that without bias as I throw out favoritism when judging these sort of things. To be one of the best action cartoons ever, you have to rely on things such as quality and ambition rather than toy sales (which is why you wouldn't see ""Transformers"" or ""GI Joe"" on my list).
Most of the ambition for this series lies in how it's presented. Rather than being full of dumb action, dialogue, etc. it likes to tell its stories visually and cinematically. Widescreen, fullscreen, multiple screens, almost no speaking roles, however they believe is the right way to frame their shots or tell their stories, they do it! You'd almost think that the show is low budget due to the fact that not only are the story boarders the actual writers, that the creator is involved in co-directing or being the sole director of every episode, that the same people in almost every department are behind every episode, but also that they even hired a couple of the best voice actors in the business (Phil Lamar and the late Mako Iwamatsu) yet sparingly use them--indeed, the villain Aku is not seen as much as audiences would hope for and it's his influence that is more felt rather than his presence. This all goes in the face of most viewer expectations and, as a result, would turn off most casual and amateur viewers--of which I admit, I was one of them. When you dare to go that route, you can't say that a project like this isn't ambitious.
Of course, that's not to say you don't get your fill of the hero and villain throughout this series' run. Mako provides such energy to the all-evil and all-powerful Aku that whenever he is onscreen, your attention is grabbed and is not let go! Jack himself (even though his character is not truly named) is as stoic a hero as any out there thanks to the work of Phil Lamar as his character tries (yet fails) to find a way back to the past in order to defeat this demonic being. This duo makes up perhaps one of the greatest (and most white and black) hero and villain rivalries out there, putting them in strong contention with the likes of Batman and Joker, Clark Kent and Lex Luthor, and Optimus Prime and Megatron.
Genndy Tartakovsky, one of the best animators in the business today, approached this series first with his imagination: he pictured a world overrun by mutants and tried to survive in this world with his girl by his side and a sword in his hand. He then turned to some of his favorite movies (as explained in the Season 1 DVD intro written by him): Conan the Barbarian (most of all), Blade Runner, Star Wars, Seven Samurai, etc. He follows the T.S. Elliot quote stating ""Bad artists borrow, good artists steal"" by making each of these stories and references into his own tales and presenting them to their fullest effect. The idea of a ""chosen one"" samurai character, displaced from his own time, to a totally different world at odds with his own way of life is good enough (""Gargoyles"" also did this quite well) and to turn each episode into a fight for his life and/or what is right adds even more intrigue. Each setting is different allowing Genndy and his team to tell mini-movies if you will and come up with different stories, which according to Eric Radomski was the same approach for the great ""Batman TAS"" even though on his show it would always take place in or around Gotham. Indeed, the very first episode itself will have you hooked and wanting more. I myself would put it up there as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, premiere cartoon episode of all time as well as the Season 3 episode ""The Birth of Evil I-II"" as one of the greatest origin stories ever put to animation.
If you're a collector of great TV shows, animated or otherwise, you need this series as part of your collection.",1495756800,,4018,4.543448275862069

The original run of Samurai Jack series from Cartoon Network. I'd expect another set might come out in the near future, featuring the complete series (Seasons 1-5) when the Adult Swim season finishes up on television, but this is good find, until such a time comes.

The DVDs are in great shape and would have given a 5th star, but the DVDs and even the inside of the cases needed to be either wiped down or shaken over a trash can as there was paper, cardboard, and misc. stuff either on the DVDs or in the containers. The DVD's play fine and have no problems that I've seen or noticed.

So I'll concentrate on the quality of the DVDs:
The DVDs have all in all a very good quality. The only set back is that the covers are made out of paper, because of this you can easily see how the Paperback's quality get worse with every time you watch it. The adventage of this cover is the great design which can be admired when you put out
The DVDs itself have very good quality too. They look very expensively made.
The ratio is the original one (1:1.33) so you will have two black stripes on the sides of your widescreen TV which is only an adventage but I thought I should mention it.

Directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, before he made Star Wars: Clone Wars Vol. 1 and 2, and Sym-Bionic Titan, Samurai Jack tells the story of a samurai transported from Feudal Japan to the distant future by an all powerful Wizard who he seeks to destroy to save the Earth.  The action is stellar, the characters are rich with cultural references to popular culture, and the art work and style in each episode is the reason I purchased this entire collection, even though I had previously seen all of them.  It is a complete series, so making this purchase will mean you never need to buy updates to your collection.  It is so worth it!  I am not selling my copy!

2878918,5,B000S1MM4S,"No regrets in getting all the Samurai Jack I can get my hands on (though I did technically buy the 4th season separately...at any rate...).

Why do I love Samurai Jack? It's hard to describe. I do love Japan, I spent 2 years there, but that certainly isn't the biggest appeal--in fact, I can say that it isn't a very accurate depiction of many aspects of the country, particularly the implications behind what a samurai truly is. I think it's a cartoon with a lot of artistic-feeling appeal. I don't think many younger kids would like it; it's perfectly clean and appropriate for kids, but it is most definitely not the loud, fast-paced, music and bright color-filled experience most kid's shows are. There's a combination of things really. First and foremost, I am in love with the unique 2D animation and subtle audio. It really makes the experience. I think that it sort of embodies Jack... typically quiet and subtle, hiding the awesome strength and skill contained by never-failing patience; but at the same time also able to channel that skill into epic-battle-winning fury. Then slip in some comical moments, the various challenges Jack faces in each episode, and the overlying save-the-world from the evil Aku(which, by the way, actually means 'evil' in Japanese--his face subtly shaped like the Japanese character) theme which is touched upon with varying degrees of weight in most episodes, and you've got one killer cartoon.",1293148800,,1435,4.979166666666667

The colors and landscapes are so stimulating and soothing at the same time.  Wish the series had never ended.  This is definitely a 10 our of 10 star animated creation.  Kudos to the originator and all involved.  It gives us great pleasure.  Such a relief from all the reality on TV.  Our minds and souls need the break.

2878921,5,B000S1MM4S,"Let me start off by saying that this is a fresh take on cartoons.  The reason I fist started watching this was for the art.  Then the story line just lept out at you and pulled you in.  The art is outstanding for many reasons.  They take a no black line approach.  This makes the art flow in the scenes, and stand out as something unique.  The fight scenes are also put together with great thought.  Tartakovsky also pulls aspects that used to be sewn into cartoons (justice, honor, and friendship) and makes them a common theme.
The story starts off in a past time and jumps into the future after he tries to go and fight the evil Aku.  The series takes a very artful approach from there as we follow Jack while he tries to catch up to Aku.  The ultimate goal is to destroy Aku with his magic sword that was his fathers.  We follow Jack as he fights Aku's minions and makes some friends along the way.  Always eager to defend the weak, and to right the injustices that he sees.  Aku is constantly trying to trick and crush Jacks moral.  This is one of those rare jems you can not pass up if interested in anime.",1266278400,5,1112,4.213270142180095

This cartoon is perfect for ANYONE above 7 or 8.  I absolutely LOVE the way the seemingly-simple animation portrays so much meaning!  The animation, along with the brilliant sound effects, create tremendous depth in every scene.  The cartoon is also loaded with great stereotypical (though NOT politically-incorrect) references that would be acceptable (and educational) to any reasonable parent.  GO JACK!!",1252454400,4,567,5.459770114942529
2878927,5,B000S1MM4S,"Samurai Jack!!! The Best Of The Best!!!

I have always loved cartoons, but in the past few years television animation has degenerated for the most part into inane nonsense with no real message or clever writing. There are exceptions however, and chief among them is the masterpiece of animation that is Samurai Jack.

This Emmy Award winning series, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of the greatest animated series ever! Why Cartoon Network ceased its production of the show will always remain a mystery to me. I still think of it as a travesty of monumental proportions.

Each episode in this brilliant series is well written, and amazingly executed. This is not your basic slapped together Saturday morning cartoon. Samurai Jack is high art. There was never anything like it before on television, and there has not been anything to match it since.

Each episode has a theme and a message that can be translated into values and ethics that really matter in life; courage, honor, loyalty, generosity, tenacity, integrity, intelligence, humor, respect, beauty, magnanimity, and education are writ large upon the sandaled path of Samurai Jack's quest.

All of this is rendered in vividly astonishing and utterly unique animation that is cinematic and epic in nature, not to mention every frame could be made into a fine art print. Samurai Jack with his magical, ancestral katana gripped firmly in hand, though alone in a world strange and unknown to him, he stands resolute and triumphant against impossible odds, striving ever forward to defeat evil, uphold justice and mercy, and return to defend his homeland from misery and destruction, thus saving the world from a future of bondage and terror.

If you want a magnificent piece of art and literature purchase this series.

2878928,5,B000S1MM4S,"On a bizarre, futuristic alternate Earth, a lone samurai armed only with the magic sword of his ancestors, treks through a savage world on his quest to return to his own time.

Samurai Jack fights his way through hordes of wierd alien warriors and criminal thugs, robotic armies, and dangerous monsters. He was the prince of a mythical Japanese kingdom in a previous time, liberating his nation from the enslavement of Aku (voiced by Mako), a powerful but buffoonish demonic being who is the embodiment of all things evil. Jack triumphs over Aku, but Aku cast a spell on Jack, sending him many centuries into the future. Jack finds himself in a nightmarish dystopian world subjugated by Aku's all-powerful totalitarian police-state.

Precisely WHY is this an excellent show for young people?

In this profoundly imaginitive series, Samurai Jack is a noble warrior fighting for the cause of justice, right, and good. He generously helps many oppressed people along the way, teaching them how to fight Aku's evil armies and gangs of henchmen. In the course of his quest, Jack frequently endures harsh ordeals of battle, deprivation, climate, and basic survival. He bravely stands alone against powerful adversaries who sometimes inflict grievous and brutal abuse upon him, forcing him to retreat and re-assess his strategy.

... But then Jack counter-attacks with new tactics and even greater resolve, and prevails against his opponents. He NEVER gives up! Not only is Samurai Jack a mighty warrior, he is pure of heart, merciful, and kind.

Being a father, I have largely searched in vain for contemporary cartoons that have anything of substance, suitable for my child.

Children are exposed to quite a bit of nondescript meaningless trash, in animated form. Samurai Jack is a most welcome exception!

I find this to be a triumphant, intelligent, and truly worthy presentation of the heroic ideal for young viewers.",1249257600,88,1915,5.118589743589744
