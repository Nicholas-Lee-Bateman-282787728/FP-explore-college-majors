8042519,5,B0006Q7FMY,"I saw this movie when I was a teen. It hit home because I too had the same problem and my mother treated me the same way. She had hung my sheets out the window a couple of times, but I unfortunately wasn't able to run home and beat the bus. The school was too far away.

Humiliating a child can make matters much worse. I found that because of my mother, I continued to have a problem up until the time I moved out. Once I was away, I didn't have the problem anymore because the stress my mother would put me through was gone.

Parents should think before they speak. Don't belittle a child because of something they did wrong or by accident. Try to correct the problem instead of shaming them. You'll find it works much better.

I would really love to see this movie come out on DVD... or even a re-make of the movie would be great.",1330300800,13,833,4.12962962962963

8042521,5,B0006Q7FMY,"I saw this TV movie when it first aired back in 1976. Lance Kerwin, in some really good acting, plays early teen John Curtis who has a bed wetting problem. The movie lures you in with sympathy for the boy and it is very effective. Michael Landon plays John Curtis as an adult, an ace runner, who we see breaking through the finish line at the start of the film . While pondering the question of his track abilities during an interview, he stares into a wall clock that triggers a childhood flashback. The story unfolds as we witness young John Curtis rising early and scampering to gather his bedsheets for washing. Johns father(Brian Keith)who internally wants to help his son, lives in a household where he appears to be verbally dominated by his wife. As a father with a secret, he tries with heavy machismo to reach and cure his son. At the age of 12 or 13, John's fear of being ridiculed for bed-wetting by his parents and friends is monumental, and understandably so. He desperately tries though shear will and lack of sleep to end or hide his condition to please his parents. You really feel his pain.

  This may all sound like a boring or outdated topic, but stay with it to see a family dynamic exposed and some great acting as well by Brian Keith. John  obviously has a condition that can't be helped. You could almost apply any embarrasing ailment, or even an addiction to the story and get a good message from it. His mother is downright mean and determined to embarrass her son by hanging his urine stained bed sheets out the window for all his friends and neighbors to see. The film takes place in the 50s so you can somewhat understand the naivete'.
 To avoid ridicule John bolts home from school everyday to take the sheets in before they can be seen. Doing this daily, he develops great speed and is recognized by the school track coach as a standout. A wonderful and eventually forceful showing of compassion by dad makes it all worthwhile. As we return to the adult John Curtis at the films end, he makes a bittersweet and humbling statement (in true Landon fashion).
  The Loneliest Runner is a surprisingly interesting and entertaining movie. If your in the mood to stir up emotions, this well done and probably forgotten seventies TV movie will do it. Watching it as a parent by yourself could be a learning experience. The Loneliest Runner deserves a quality dvd release.",1310688000,16,2395,4.581775700934579

It was easy to find at Amazon. thank you.",1249430400,5,237,4.130434782608695
