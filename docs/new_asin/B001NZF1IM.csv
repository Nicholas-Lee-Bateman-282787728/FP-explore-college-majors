8328533,1,B001NZF1IM,"I was totally prepared to believe the story, but was disappointed because I did not feel Mr. Bielek was relating a true story.  I admit I judge this by examining only a few of the speaker's personal traits but I think those traits speak volumes.  Mr. Bielek claims to have stood watching helplessly as his youngest brother was dying, embedded half in, half out of a wall of the Navy ship.  Even a stoic could not remain so unemotional when telling such a personal story, no matter how many years have passed or how many times the story was told.  That he speaks of his brother's horrible demise so matter-of-factly, with little or no emotion, I believe is a ""tell"" and indicates his story is fiction.  Credibility aside, I was disappointed that this was merely a lecture amateurishly recorded, and was not any kind of ""interview"" or documentary.  Still, I found the story interesting and quite detailed, but ultimately I was convinced by the speaker that he was making it all up.",1389312000,,979,4.662790697674419
