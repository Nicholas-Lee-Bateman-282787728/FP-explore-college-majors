4962350,5,B0066E6S3M,Being independent and secure with great strength Belle deals with lovers and with disdainful townspeople. She is uncompromising and is not afraid to challenge those who disapprove of her lifestyle. When some of the community leaders want her gone from her ranch she doesn't budge (till they burn it down). The less law abiding groups (outlaws) she is associated with are a source of enjoyment for her (till they are eventually ambushed and many killed). The mystery that one is left with at the end (I won't reveal it here) keeps one in suspense and with an unanswered question.,1390435200,8,578,4.848484848484849
4962351,5,B0066E6S3M,"Since I am a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery, it is easy to like this movie. I remember seeing it on television several years ago and thought it would be a good addition to my collection when I noticed the DVD was available. I have already watched and enjoyed it. Good cast and interesting story.",1365206400,8,292,4.425925925925926
4962352,3,B0066E6S3M,"This is the most unusual western of them all. A ""spaghetti"" western from 1967 written and directed by Lina Wertmuller who would go on to international acclaim with ""Love & Anarchy,"" ""Swept Away"" and ""Seven Beauties"" for which she became the first woman to be nominated for a Best Director Oscar. In ""Belle Starr"" (terrible transfer, terrible dubbing) you can see where she was coming from and where she was going. With little or no understanding of the American west or its myth, or even a knowledge of the western film genre, Lina's Belle Starr comes to the old west from a fashion layout in 1966. Then Lina tells the story of men and women (and guns) in very much the same way she would in subsequent films. Make no mistake, this is not ""The Wild Bunch"" or ""The Searchers"" but it compares favorably to any of the slew of European westerns from the 60's except those by Sergio Leone. For fans of Lina Wertmuller, this film is a must-see.",1079222400,18,938,4.523529411764706
8494009,4,B0066E6S3M,"Well, being an Elizabeth fan and a Bewitched ""fanatic,"" I guess it didn't take too long to hunt down some of her other movies; those that are available. ""Lizzie Borden"" was great, and this movie was satisfactory. I guess there's some mystery as to who shot her at the end--her son or the mad townspeople.

In any event, pretty good viewing. I'm sure there's better films with Ms. Montgomery, I just have to find them...",1523232000,,419,4.586666666666667

8494018,5,B0066E6S3M,"I love Elizabeth Montgomery.  She had turned into a talented dramatic actress after her 8 years as Samantha Stephens everyones favoret wiitch.  She sure can play scary good and cunning as well.  Belle Starr was a delight to watch.  I never knew the true story of Belle Starr.  I also googled it to get the history of this famous outlaw.  I was very intrigued by what I learned about her.  But , Elizabeth Montgomery will be missed.  She was just a joy to watch.  But now with DVD's and the magic of reruns she will always be watched somewhere in the workd.",1412812800,,556,4.372549019607843
