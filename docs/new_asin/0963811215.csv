3071518,5,0963811215,"The Vicious Sweet is truly an excellent movie, quite different and much more enjoyable than I was expecting this low-budget indie flick to be.  Written, produced, and directed by Ron Bonk (in just his second film), the story is riveting, unpredictable, serious, and compelling.  Sasha Graham gives an amazing performance as Tyler Phenix, bringing her tortured character fully to life and baring all her fears and disturbing memories for all to see.  I might also say here that the movie does not resort to having Graham bear any skin, so folks looking for a nudie horror flick won't find much satisfaction here.  Graham bears her soul but not her body.  There is a little bit of gore, but don't expect to see a blood-letting here either.  The Vicious Sweet is a psychological thriller, not an extreme horror film.
You sort of have to bear with the movie through the opening scenes.  As the movie begins, we see a couple making out in the woods whose good time is ruined first by an animated dismembered hand and then by a party of nuclear-spawned zombies.  Suddenly, we see that we are in a movie theater watching a movie on the screen, and the star of the movie is giggling her head off at the back of the theatre.  Tyler Phenix, scream-queen extraordinaire, has arrived at a crossroads.  Sick of performing in silly B-movies despite her immense popularity among fans, she yearns for something more.  When something more is offered to her, in the form of a marriage proposal and a role in a major motion picture, she backs away, retreats into herself, and contemplates suicide.  Then, in the night, someone grabs her, and she wakes up handcuffed to a bed with a strange man asking her who she is (and by that I mean who she really is deep down inside) and claiming that it is up to him to straighten her life out and get it back on the right track.  This fan of hers knows everything about her, including the worst things of her past, the very things keeping her from accepting all the offers he knows she has been getting for a better life.  The final hour of the 90-minute movie features her captor's unique form of therapy, as he compels Tyler to tell him about the things she is ashamed of-her mother's alcoholism, the abuse she suffered, her early career in porno movies, etc.  Watching this play out is an increasingly surreal experience.  Her captor hides behind masks of some of the zombies and other strange creatures featured in Tyler's horror movies, he drugs his victims at times, and she eventually begins to hallucinate.  One is sometimes hard pressed to know what is real and what is not; whenever I thought I had a handle on what was going on, the scene changed completely, and I was pulled even deeper into the evolving story.  The suspense and tension build for what almost has to be a stunning conclusion.
Here's is where I have a little bit of a problem.  I'm not totally sure I understand the ending, although I think I have a pretty good handle on it.  It is definitely climactic; I can say that much for sure.  This movie almost begs for a second viewing; knowing what I know now, it would be interesting to go back and see what clues or ideas I pick up from the story as it progresses.  This film is shot on video, which may displease some people, but it was filmed this way for a reason (not simply because this is a low-budget production).  I think many viewers will be amazed at how effectively this movie draws you in and secures a mesmerizing hold on your attention.  The first half hour is a little slow, so don't give up on this film prematurely.  This is a great example of just how good an indie film can be.",1045872000,,3642,4.506849315068493

3071520,5,0963811215,"The Vicious Sweet is a bleak, absorbing character study that blurs the line between dreams and reality. If you're looking for routine hack 'n' slash scares, look elsewhere. Writer-director Ron Bonk has crafted a unique  and intelligent thriller, one with an ever-mounting sense of tension and  dread. Bonk has a few sly tricks up his sleeves as well, and he even takes  a few clever stabs at the B-movie industry he works in.
Of course,  calling The Vicious Sweet a ""B-movie"" is a bit misleading. Sure,  it was made on a microscopic budget -- and, well, the low-grade look is  somewhat muddy -- but this one has much more heart and soul behind it than  most of the independent cheapies emerging from the underground horror  market. This one engages your emotions and your mind -- something most  so-called B-movies never even attempt to do.
With The Vicious Sweet, Ron  Bonk establishes himself as a talented filmmaker indeed. His script is  smart and edgy, with believable dialogue and a main character of surprising  depth. His direction is solid; he shows a knack for building tension and  fear, while also interweaving dreams with reality. He only falters in a  couple of scenes where the camerawork tends to distract from the drama on  display.
Then there's Sasha Graham, who also starred in such low-budget  films as Polymorph and Addicted to Murder. Always fun to watch, here she  really outdoes herself. Because, you see, she actually makes us care about  this character who some may see as an unlikable bitch. But no. Her rough  exterior is just a front for all the pain and fear that she keeps bottled  up inside, and Graham hits every note just right. C'mon, somebody please  give this girl an award.
The Vicious Sweet is really one of the most  intelligent and moving indie horror movies I've seen in quite some time.  And it's even got one hell of an ending.",961286400,,1871,4.74223602484472

8243621,1,0963811215,"Thanks for the invitation.  On the one hand, as bad as this movie is, I'd like to take you up on it.  On the other hand, I am committed to non-aggression, so I guess not.

Things I hated about the 90s:

1)  Grunge.
2)  Gangsta Rap
3)  Bill Clinton
4)  Movies like this.

Rule number one for a Scream Queen Movie:  If you bother to have a Skull & Crossbones at all, the Skull & Crossbones must be a credible representation of something scary.  It helps not to use construction paper.

Frankly, I am flabbergasted.  This movie looks like someone's Senior Art Thesis gone horribly wrong.  Entertaining?  No.  Horrifying?  Absoltuely, but not in that cool Horror Movie sort of way.  Amazing?  For all the wrong reasons.

Stilted dialogue.  Non-credible plot.  A villain that can't pull off villainy.  Hackneyed in every possible way without all that inconvenient hacking/slashing.  I really have no idea what is going on here.",1523836800,,922,4.726114649681529

THE VICIOUS SWEET shows that you can still deliver a movie with an intelligent script, creative camerawork, an effective score (by Jeff Jones, who also played a part in the film) and wonderful acting even though you're working with a low budget. It has it's rough spots, but director Ron Bonk's tense writing and sharp direction raise the movie above its weaknesses.",1523059200,,430,4.904109589041096

I'm sorry they wasted the 20 dollars to make this ... maybe they got a gov grant tho for 2 million , the gov likes to throw that money out there. Only other reason is to show this in a theatrics' class to show how bad you can fail. On the bright side  you can go pick oranges in California because of the  tighter immigration . writing review  was only fun on this movie.

As is, it may have made a better radio play; the producer could have invested his time & energy in a worthwhile script & found a couple of decent voice actors.
