It's fun to see a pre-Mel Vic Tayback in the role of Jojo Krako, as well as the series regulars take cracks at Gangster humour.

Good for diehards only!!!!",1330905600,,261,4.531914893617022
7806520,5,6300213536,"""Tribbles"" may be the best known comic episode, but ""Piece of the Action"" is possibly funnier. McCoy doesn't get to do much but assist the two leads, but the interactions with Kirk and Spock are priceless. Also interesting is the guest-starring role played by Vic Tayback, the sort of character actor (he played crooks and tough guys) one would not normally associate with Star Trek.

While trying to help a planet run by gangsters, Kirk and his two pals are captured repeatedly, until Kirk wises up and decides to out-gangster everyone. The Bosses on the planet stop treating Kirk as a chump once he starts acting tough and says ""Look here, da Federation is taking over. We've had it with you penny-ante operators!""

The beauty of this twist is that Kirk for the most part does not depend on a technological solution... sure, Kirk could level the planet or send down a hundred of his ""boys"" (i.e. red shirts) with phasers, but that would violate the Prime Directive. Instead, as in so many of the best shows -- starting with ""The Corbomite Manuever"" -- Kirk has to use psychology. It's one reason the original series stays so watchable, while the spin-offs are more hit and miss.

Priceless are the moments (probably due to co-writer Gene Coon) in which ""Spocko"" tries to keep up with Kirk's gangster talk, with predictably mixed results. The best scene of all features the card game ""Fizzbin"" that Kirk makes up to distract his captors. ""It's a real game, a MAN'S game, probably beyond your intelligence."" That phrase (""man's game"") has been part of my family's language for playing poker ever since.",1187913600,,1602,4.797101449275362
7806521,5,6300213536,"In my opinion, A Piece Of The Action is in the top 3 episode category along with Mirror Mirror and the Corbomite Manuever.  The whole episode is very deep and never uneventful. The action never stops. It employs humor in the form of ""slang talk"" which people like Spock and McCoy don't understand. I cant explain it all here, but I will tell you it is a very good episode.",991094400,6,372,4.314285714285714
