Don't just sit there! Go! Go buy the first tape! I promise you won't be disappointed!) I wasn't going to type up a review, but this one was just too good to not be praised. (Yes, yes, I know i've only gotten to this tape so far, but i couldn't just pass it up!) This one is definitely good. Lot's of chemistry going on between Miaka and Tamahome; Nuriko also starts to dress like a man in this one. It's pretty much just Miaka/Tamahome sap, but its also got enough action in it to keep ya awake ^_^. Hmmmmmm...did i forget something? Oh! How could i forget! Chichiri, the wondering monk, is introduced! Yeah! Chichiri is so awesome! Oh, and one more thing, Yui is found in the Kutou Empire, mind corrupted, making her an enemy to the Suzaku seishi. o.o *gasp*",991699200,,929,4.254237288135593

I think they did relatively well and when some words can be translated as several different ones you just have to find the best in context word you can.  I think this video is great!  Awesome story and Chichiri is so great.  HIGHLY recommend!  (Good job Pioneer, some people appriciate you bringing FY to America.)",988761600,,362,4.507692307692308
7886484,4,6305261555,"Fushigi Yugi is a wonderful anime series. The characters are all great. The only one that I don't care for is Miaka(the main character)who's a bit niave and just... anoying. Well that's just my opinion. See for yourself. Anyways, the story plot is great and it has comedy, action, tragedy, suspence, romance and more! This mainly focuses on Miaka and her chemistry between Tamahome and there adventures trying to find the susaku seven. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the animation quality is a little poor at times. The animators must have gotten lazy. If your worried about which episode to buy, don't. They are all great. And if you like bishonen(fem-looking guys)than this is definantly for you. Over all this is a must see anime that you will love!",978220800,,773,4.733333333333333

7886487,4,6305261555,"In this volume, Fushigi Yuugi really makes the transition from being a fun, light-hearted, conventional shoujo anime, to being a dark cautionary tale, with real emotional depth. It can be a very startling transition. If  you're expecing more sweetness and light, from here on out, you won't find  as much. However, if you're looking for good writing, good acting, and  excellent character and plot development, you're looking for it in the  right place. It's well worth buying the professional version, even if you  have the fansubs; having seen both, I can definitely say that the  professional translation is far superior.",952732800,2,624,5.19
