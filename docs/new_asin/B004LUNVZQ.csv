8434878,4,B004LUNVZQ,"Well made and entertaining  I don't entirely believe Tierney as a nice guy but he clearly demonstrates the fact that he had been a trained actor before his typecast movie career.  Priscilla Lane, usually a reliable actress, gives an unconvincing  performance in this.",1504310400,,267,5.162790697674419
8434879,4,B004LUNVZQ,"The Bodyguard is not Dillinger or Born to Kill, but any movie with Lawrence Tierney is well worth watching.",1454284800,,107,4.684210526315789
8434880,5,B004LUNVZQ,"Good film noir. Tight plot, and not too long. Very worth watching.",1432857600,,66,4.583333333333333
8434881,3,B004LUNVZQ,"Although somewhat entertaining, some critics felt that 13 minutes were cut from the film which would have patched up some of the leaky holes in a somewhat convoluted plot.  Apparently there is a director's cut of the film which runs 75 minutes, but  this version I  have on DVD runs only 62 minutes.

Anyway, Tierney is always interesting to watch and Priscilla Lane makes the most of a role as his love interest,

8434882,4,B004LUNVZQ,"Hot-headed former detective Lawrence Tierney is framed for the the murder of the police boss who fired him. He manages to stay one step ahead of the police as he races to track down the real killer and clear his name, with the help of his girlfriend Priscilla Lane. This is a well paced and efficient B film with some good one liners from Tierney. Interesting to see Tierney in different role to his usual bad guy characters (Dillinger, Born to Kill, The Devil Thumbs A Ride). The black and white picture and sound are in excellent condition for this 60+ year old movie. No extras, not even a theatrical trailer. Picture quality 9/10, Sound 9/10, Movie 6.5/10",1313798400,21,659,4.593220338983051
