8541704,5,B000EQ62DE,"Finally a set of rock water feature videos that are actually helpful! I have purchased numerous rock waterfall videos and Bill Meakin's videos are hands down the best I've ever seen. The quality alone is superb! Every aspect from beginning the water feature to its completion is clearly explained and demonstrated in great detail. I've spent hundreds of dollars on other videos that, quite frankly, wasted my time and left me more confused than when I began; not so with Bill's videos! Whether you're a do-it-yourselfer or a pro, these videos will save you time, money, and lots of frustration with the learning curve. Thanks Bill for an excellent set of videos that I can wholeheartedly recommend!!",1180310400,,699,4.982905982905983
8541705,5,B000EQ62DE,"Wow, Bill you have done it again. For someone wanting to build a pondless waterfall, this video is the one to buy. I have the ""How to Design & Build a Pond"" video in which he made a pondless water fall, and knew I had to have it. I love how the video goes through all of the steps.  Not only will you gain knowledge, but this video will also save you money.  With my last pondless waterfall that I built, it saved me $500.00. Because of Bill, and this video, I've got to say thinks for making me a better pond/pondless waterfall builder.

Thanks Again for all of your help.
