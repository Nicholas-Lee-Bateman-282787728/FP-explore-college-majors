8475157,2,B005IWG5I6,"I got this video because I am 67 and wanted a slower, non-jerky, balance and core video on the exercise ball.  This video isn't nearly long enough to help you unless you do it twice a day or something.  The way she has you move your arms is too fast.  I hurt both arms trying to keep up with the pace.  The balance section is good however.  I thought the presentation was good and Suzanne is a delightful person.",1389225600,2,412,4.1645569620253164
8475158,3,B005IWG5I6,"The work outs themselves are ok but the presentation is a little annoying
I do not like its disjointed and its not consistent
They focus on middle person and crop the modified moves out  often",1362960000,4,192,4.485714285714286
8475159,5,B005IWG5I6,"Suzanne Andrews has a winner for seniors in this DVD showing you how to improve your balance, strength and flexibility. Great music along with standing and seated versions so a beginner can follow along and get results. There are two therapeutic workouts that are safe, effective and fun.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a fast paced DVD, you won't like this one because it moves slowly making it safe for seniors who have balance issues and a good choice as a gift for grandparents.  Also comes with a special feature where you can skip through the introduction and go directly to the beginning of the workout.
