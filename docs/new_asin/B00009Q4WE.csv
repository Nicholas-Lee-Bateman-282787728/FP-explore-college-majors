1888141,5,B00009Q4WE,"I love India (""Acoustic Soul"" is one of my all-time favorite recordings) and when I saw the title ""LIVE In Brazil,"" I was expecting to see her band blow through another incredible electric set...vocal improvs w/Kerisha Hicks, deliciously drawn-out jams, killer chops from drummer Forrest Robinson, the whole nine.) What ""Live In Brazil"" ended up delivering was an experience actually far more rewarding.
Seeing India's band perform an unplugged set of ""A.S."" material would be enough for me. So would a documentary on the wonders of Bahia itself. Put the two together, though, and you got a religious experience, baby. Some of the performances (the band playing ""Beautiful"" while looking out onto the vast expanse of the ocean under an exquisite sunset, the Baiao-flavored version of ""I See The God In You"" in the tall grass, a deeply moving solo performance of ""India's Song,"" Arie's heavenly voice echoing throughout the palatial Igreja De Sao Francisco...etc.) literally brought tears to my eyes. The material (all acoustically performed and mostly from ""Soul"") and setting create a majesty that is altogether beyond words.
Even more affecting was the band's reaction to and interaction with the music, culture, and people around them--India getting downright teary while watching a local musician who reminded her of herself, Forrest Robinson exclaiming ""I BEEN REBORN!"" after an ecstatic ""Video""-turned-Samba-Reggae jam with the legendary Ile Aye in the troupe's hometown 'hood of Curuzu, India and Kerisha getting swept up in song with Margareth Menezes and Olodum...one unreal scene after another--and all beautifully captured. (The extra scenes on Capoeira, traditional music, and behind-the-scenes happenings with the band and crew are merely icing on the cake.)
Arie referred to her time in Bahia as a ""reward""--and that's exactly what this exceptional DVD is for the viewer. If you're a fan of Ms. India, Bahia (or beautiful places in general), Brazilian music, or just watching some of the greatest creative spirits on the planet converge, exchange ideas, play some truly classic tunes, and laugh (a lot), all the while living and breathing the time-honored notion that music is indeed THE universal language, please do yourself a favor and check it out. It's the ""Voyage"" that Arie's sophomore CD may have intended but never fully delivered.",1063670400,7,2354,5.313672922252011
1888142,5,B00009Q4WE,"I have to admit that I had never heard any of India Arie's music before purchasing this DVD. The reason why is because I rarely listen to the radio anymore. It hurts me a little because I don't stay up to date with the newer artist. But sooner or later I get to hear them all. I actually purchased the DVD because of my interest in Brazil. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she decided to do a DVD in Bahia which is one of my favorite areas of Brazil. Her music is actually a combination of folk music and R&B. Although she records on Motown she does not play the Motown sound that most of us are familiar with. Actually her music is quite relaxing but the strength of her songs is definately the lyrics. Her voice is ok but not as powerful as say Jill Scott, Angie Stone or Mary J. The camera work is great and the sound is outstanding. She discusses each song and Brazil thoughout the video. She also features several local Brazilian groups and singers in some of her songs. The videos also feature plenty of sights in Bahia. Her and her band really seem to fit in well with the locals. Music critics like to refer to her type of music as ""Neo-Soul"" or new soul but let's face it, Bill Withers was doing this type of music back in the 1970s! But it is refreshing to hear something besides rap music from new musical artist. So purchase this DVD even if you are not a fan. The beautiful scenery and relaxing songs help to make this a very good DVD. I should add that although I am a fan of Bryant McKnight, I like India's DVD better.
Note: Several famous Brazilian musicians including Olodum, Ile Aiye and Margareth Menezes stop by and jam with India Arie in the DVD!",1060214400,21,1673,4.264150943396227
1888143,5,B00009Q4WE,I find the audio and video quality to be very good. India Arie and all of the players are truly enjoying themselves and making some great music. I fall in love with her every time that I watch it. Besides having a great voice writing great songs and playing guitar she just seems so genuine. She jokes and smiles and just seems lovely in every way. I have gifted this DVD to several friends.,1378512000,,391,4.297297297297297
1888144,5,B00009Q4WE,India Arie never lets me down. She is a talented artist with a spectacular voice with meaningful songs for the heart.,1364083200,,117,4.619047619047619
1888145,5,B00009Q4WE,"Watching the people and listen to their music was wonderful and the scene with india and her crew singing ""In my Head,"" while standing in the water was lovely,",1361232000,,159,4.517241379310345
1888146,5,B00009Q4WE,"Recommended by a musician friend who was in this DVD.  What a great place to make a DVD.  Vibrant.  I felt I was there. Beautiful music, the playing in the water was relaxing.  All around great musicians.  The locals were a treat to watch, very talented individuals.  I would like to visit sometime.",1356393600,,299,4.547169811320755
1888147,3,B00009Q4WE,"This DVD reminded me of why I love India's music... because it is so thoroughly a representation of who she is and how she feels. Her music is so positive and heartfelt, seeing her perform and discuss the music and the location was a welcome change from the mainstream.  She demonstrates again that there's plenty of wonder and beauty out there to enjoy and you don't need an expensive car or any caviar to take part.",1305331200,,417,4.4868421052631575
1888148,5,B00009Q4WE,Wow! this Sista is not only Beautiful!....she's a Powerful! Soul moving little power house!....Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful! in every way...this is a must! have DVD.,1280016000,,166,5.958333333333333
1888149,5,B00009Q4WE,These songs are very relaxing! India Arie has a beautiful voice! My husband and I watched this video on Palladia Channel and fell in love with it!,1251936000,,146,4.444444444444445
1888150,4,B00009Q4WE,"Always loved India's music. DVD shows more of her ""down to earth"" side and her love of life and people.",1227398400,,103,4.2
1888151,5,B00009Q4WE,"I love this dvd!! it is gorgeous to look at and to listen to. India's voice is amazing!! She draws you in with the warmth of her gift,and paints a perfect picture with her words. I can feel the words of each song because they are sung with a deep conviction of her spirit.
  Do not let this dvd escape you!!!",1220227200,,308,4.032786885245901
1888152,5,B00009Q4WE,"I first came across the MIHP series when my wife gave me the ""India Arie in Brazil"" DVD for Christmas. I have always enjoyed India's music and musical style, so she figured it would be a good present. It has turned out to be one of the best Christmas presents ever!! I watch it all the time!!!

I was blown away by the sound, scenery and the talent of India Arie. She has an amazing voice and tone that really sits well with me. To me, her voice is 100% pure. Devoid of big time rifts and show-off styles like many of the more famous performers in the spotlight. What makes this DVD great is the fact that India Aire really felt at home in Bahia. She really appreciated the culture, the music and the history of Bahia. She even sang with some of the local talent and let the musicians play with her band.

The way the DVD is produced makes you feel as if you are right there with India, as she just breaks out in a song. I've seen the MIHP ""Brian McKnight in Brazil"", and I didn't like that one nearly as much as this. For one, the music in McKnight's DVD sounds as if he is in a studio even though he is singing in front of a group of locals. Also, he had the typical American (Wow, you people really live like this...) condescending attitude that Americans take with them when visiting other countries, which was very annoying. As a result of watching both DVD's, I love India Arie more and like Brian McKnight a whole lot less.",1198713600,,1430,4.2153284671532845
1888153,5,B00009Q4WE,"I was determined that this would be a piece of crap for 7 dollars but when i watched this DVD for the first time, i realized it was unlike any other. i was expecting a standard musical perdormance, but like always, India Aire surprises you with a personal and beautiful experience...if you are a devote  fan, this is an epic choice.",1181865600,,332,4.442622950819672
1888154,5,B00009Q4WE,the DVD is excellen. INdia arie is really a great performer..with heart and sould..she delivers and you won't/can't be dissappointed..,1173657600,,134,5.75
1888155,4,B00009Q4WE,"I am a fan of the entire ""Music In High Places"" series, so this met my expectations to the fullest.

Watching india.arie perform in these beautiful places is both relaxing and inspiring.",1140739200,4,186,4.8125
1888156,3,B00009Q4WE,"Surprising, showing northeast Brazil, black and poor, not the real Brazil but lovely and different.

Could have more known songs. Good.",1138665600,,135,5.428571428571429
1888157,5,B00009Q4WE,"I bought several of the MIHP series, not knowing some of the artists.  But I did see India Arie on HDNET and love her voice, and I'm not an R&B fan at all.

Video quality is top notch, as the title is anamorphic.  Love the ""play music only"" features on these.  Check out other MIHP titles, especially the Goo goo dolls and Ryan Adams!",1134345600,3,334,4.171875
1888158,5,B00009Q4WE,"This DVD is what I call real talent. India is in a league of her own.  I mean yeah she does not have the power that some of the other R&B stars have. But I want some of these other R&B to leave the studio and try to record a DVD with just you and a few instruments. We all know they would sound a hot mess.  That's why I like the DVD India is down there in Brazil being REAL! Real with the people, Real with her music and most of all Real with herself.  Her voice is not meant to be a powerhouse but her voice has a conviction that just mesmerizes you as she sings.  I loved her CD's before but I just went back and got the DVD and I must say it's just Fantastic!",1123545600,,663,3.7482014388489207
1888159,5,B00009Q4WE,"""Live in Brasil"" alternates between tastefully done interview cutaways in which India discusses her experience visiting Brasil and on-location recordings with some of the most beautiful footage I have ever seen. The first song features India and her band performing knee deep in the ocean. A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of native Brasilian artists performing their music as well as joining India's group for a block party in Brasil, in a place India says reminds her of Brooklyn.

The sound quality and technical production quality of this DVD is excellent, the best I've heard anywhere. India's music on this release is exceptional both for its creativity and for her uplifting spiritual lyrics and beautiful voice. I felt as if I were traveling with India's band and experiencing the music in a fresh new and personal way. The movie concludes with a montage of behind the scenes footage that is sure to please anyone who wants to know more about the craft of cinematography. We see the crew doing their jobs and enjoying every minute of it, with refreshing candor.

If you like India Arie's music you will love this DVD, and for musicians who want to expand their horizons with the flavor of Brasil, this will also be a hit. But the best thing about this movie is its advocacy of cross cultural experience, which is sorely needed in this age of inflated fears about foreign lands.",1101254400,5,1390,4.836134453781512
1888160,5,B00009Q4WE,"I've enjoyed India's music for the last year and found this
DVD purely by chance.
I quickly sampled the fisrt couple of tracks and thought
great locations and pictures but the sound is too good
so it can't be a live performance, just another playback job.
On another evening I played more tracks and then discovered
on the end a ""making of"" section which clearly shows the
sound crew not running a playback system but placing
microphones and recording the tracks.
This whole DVD is about talent.
Great pictures, great sound recorded on location, and of
course India looking and sounding superb.
If you like latin and soul styled music, this is the one!",1084233600,,652,4.728070175438597
1888161,5,B00009Q4WE,"This DVD is so beautiful, it really shows how spiritual India is. This is a must have in anyones collection.",1074211200,2,108,4.45
1888162,5,B00009Q4WE,"I wasn't a fan of India Arie at all until I bought this DVD. Like another reviewer here, I purchased this DVD out of an interest in Brazil and a general interest in R&B. I find the idea of an American R&B artist collaborating with Afro-Brazilian artists fascinating and much more natural than other cross-cultural collaborations. I think this DVD definitely demonstrates where music will be going, or at least should be going. I agree with the other reviewer that this DVD is better than the Brian McKnight one. There is much more local collaboration on this DVD. The camera works is also superior on this DVD. But the Brian McKnight one is worth purchasing too. Hopefully there will be more DVDs like these!",1065916800,10,708,4.717741935483871
