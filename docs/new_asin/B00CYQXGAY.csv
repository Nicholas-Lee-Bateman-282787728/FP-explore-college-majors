5755083,2,B00CYQXGAY,"To the day I die I will still defend season's 10 through 12 being solid season's of CSI (despite the absence of Grissom). Season 13, however, made a few big mistakes (splitting up Grissom and Sara crossed the line). But this season, everything that can go wrong, goes wrong.

I'm not going to act like this season is awful, it's not. It's still pretty enjoyable at times. But there are mistakes that need to be fixed that still aren't, and they completely miss some great opportunities.

For example, the 300th episode ""Frame by frame"" features special guest star Marg Helgenberger (who left in season 12). In the episode, we see our CSI members try to crack a cold case that goes back 13 years. How could that go wrong? Unfortunately, instead of using an actual cold case from season 1 or 2, they introduce a completely new one that strangely was never mentioned in season 1 (because the case didn't exist!). Instead of actually having Marg Helgenderger's character Catherine return, she filmed ""flashbacks"" for the case. This doesn't work BECAUSE we know what she looked like in season 1. It's too obvious in the ""flashbacks"" that the actress is not the same age she was in season 1. Seriously, whose idea was this? Let's say they still went with creating a new case, and even if the writing sucked, having Catherine return for an episode still would have been great. So who made the decision to just have the actress film ""flashbacks""? Doing this takes much of the impact of the actress returning away because the character didn't actually come back. Since the parts we see her in already happened, having the actress back doesn't do anything for the story. To it's credit, the last 60 seconds of the 300th episode are still worth watching. There's a nice montage of shots from episodes throughout the series that is pretty entertaining to watch. The only problem is that you also see clips from season 1. So even if you can suspend disbelief watching the episode that the ""flashbacks"" really are Catherine from season 1, all of that is meaningless when you actually see clips of her 13 years younger within the same episode. Also, the episode ends by zooming in on a bag that says ""case solved by Grissom and Sidle"" which is pretty much telling the audience ""don't you guys miss it when these characters were together?"" It's like the writers forgot that they slip them up!

Now let's look at the season finale; the departure of Jim Brass. Wait, you didn't know that? This is because the episode fails to make it clear that this is Brass's final episode (it doesn't help that he's only in the episode for 10 minutes). But you can't argue that the actor decided to leave after the episode was done filming because the ending of the episode still implies that he's leaving (but it's only obvious if you knew this before hand). This episode should have had more focus on the character, and whether he left or was killed off, it should have been emotional. This is the opposite of how you send off a character that's been around for so many years, not to mention the fact that the writers REALLY jumped the shark with his daughter in the premiere. I can buy his daughter going crazy, but criminal mastermind? Really?

In reality, the season finale sums up everything wrong with this season; it's sloppy, it's unfocused, and it doesn't know where to go. These are simply two examples of episodes that had so much potential for the show to redeem itself, but somehow it fails every time. Every decision this season makes is just wrong.",1401667200,6,3532,4.655448717948718
5755084,4,B00CYQXGAY,"You'd think after fourteen years, two spin-offs, a host of imitators and numerous cast changes, CSI would be a played out hand by now. Living on past glories. Cruising on auto-pilot until the expense of making it outweighs the revenue it brings. Just a bunch of actors, writers and producers spinning the wheels of the gravy-train and playing on audience's emotional momentum.

You'd be wrong.

The 14th Season of CSI is like a bag of movie-theater popcorn: buttery, oversalted, greasy...and freaking delicious. With only a few members of the original cast left, it retains a great deal of the charisma it originally had when it rightfully swept to the top of the ratings heap in its first season. It opens with a resolution to the cliffhanger which ended Season 13 (""The Devil and D.B. Russel""), and after clearing that up, begins the usual yearlong sojourn into the investigation of brutal murders, twisted motives and head-scratching disappearances. Some of the best episodes:

""Torch Song"" -- the CSI team investigates an arson that left a musical venue burnt to the ground, four people dead, and a huge list of suspects behind.

""Last Supper"" -- A cynical-amusing take on murder at a reality game show that looks suspiciously like ""Top Chef.""

""Frame by Frame"" - Kathryn Willows returns in flashbacks for the show's 300th episode.

""Check In and Check Out"" -- this episode, about mysterious death occurring in a sleazy motel, was strongly reminiscent of the Grissom years.

""Keep Calm and Carry On"" -- CSI is very good and grabbing viewer interest early and then twisting the plots until they look like rigatoni; this episode, whose plot is way too complex to explain, is a prime example of this.

""Boston Brakes"" -- The team investigates murders that may -- or may not -- be linked to a shadowy wing of the U.S. government.

""De Los Muertos"" - Nick travels to Mexico to investigate the mysterious death of a young Mexican-American girl. An outstandingly tense, gritty, and black-comic look at a nation on the verge of total governmental collapse.

""Long Road Home"" - Gene Simmons of KISS guest stars in this bloody but often hilarious story of rock-band debauchery gone horribly wrong.

""The Fallen"" - A superbly brutal and twist-ridden story that has a shooter storm LVPD HQ and take Russel hostage.

I mention these specifically but really, there are very few losers in this bunch (""Love For Sale"" is a very good story and ""Killer Moves"" reminded me of some of the earlier ""impossible mystery"" episodes like the dead frogman in the tree or the time Warrick had to investigate the spontaneous combustion killing).  I originally wasn't crazy about Ted Danson being cast on CSI but he grew on me very quickly and now seems as if he's been there for ten years rather than three -- a calm, confident, fatherly presence reminiscent of Grissom without looking like an imitation. One thing I particularly enjoyed was the development of Marc Vanns character, Conrad Ecklie, in the early part of the season. Marc Vann has long been a quiet asset to the show, and now has a chance to show off some of his acting ability with meatier story lines. And the 300th episode was nicely done  I thought it was very classy of them to show Gary Dourdans face, considering the ill-will that surrounded his departure from the show.

Now, the trouble with CSI at this point is not that the story lines are uninteresting (on the contrary, if anything the story lines are now too fantastical), but rather that the formula has become too rigid and therefore too predictable. I used to be wrong about 60% of the time when I tried to figure out the guilty party in the early going; now Im right about 80% of the time (or better). On top of that, the plots have gotten so preposterous as to strain my suspension of disbelief. Is there anyone in the cast who hasn't been shot, kidnapped, killed someone, been the target of a serial killer, etc? And since were on the subject, how many brilliant, diabolical serial killers with a flashy M.O. can possibly visit one city in 14 years? Remind me never to go to Las Vegas! Finally, Ive never quite been able to recover from the loss of Grissom and Warrick. The show just isn't the same without them, and I say that with all respect to both Ted Dansen and Laurence Fishburne, both of whom I enjoy(ed). As for the HD-type image quality, it's horribly unflattering to hairpieces, makeup and age-lines. (Somebody needs to stop the pancake makeup on Elizabeth Harnois STAT.)

Having said that, for a show thats been chugging along for fourteen years, CSI has done a damn fine, even a spectacular, job of maintaining its best quality, which is its sheer addictability. This is binge television watching at its finest. I can go through five or six of these episodes as casually as I can eat a bowl of the afformentioned popcorn. Angus Young once remarked that the greatest compliment AC/DC could get as a band was that the new album sounded just like the old one, and I think that this season of CSI is just like the last one. Tight storytelling. Outrageous plots. Sci-fi science. Stylized dialogue. Vegas history. Mood lighting. Beautiful women. Twisted motives. And corpses, corpses, corpses.

Heres to another fourteen years of it.",1396828800,21,5249,4.7759381898454745

I never did understand Fishburne's character and how it added to the mix.  He's awesome but it felt that his part never fleshed out.  The stories always were fascinating even after so many years.  I think it ended appropriately.  Just buy it, sit down for the long haul, and enjoy.",1500508800,,428,4.341772151898734

5755586,5,B00CYQXGAY,"Another excellent series of this incredibly good TV series and thankfully a box set that I can view here in the UK. I guess that CBS are about the only producers making DVDs that we can see over here because they have a product of which they are proud - well done CBS.  This series gets better with each season. I had got very despondent with it when Will Peterson left but since the appearance of Ted Danson it has regained it's sparkle. I'm unsure of Elisabeth Schue's character but I imagine she appeals to many viewers and I guess she will grow on me. Elisabeth's portrayal of her character is certainly very good, she makes the character very believable. Having visited Las Vegas several times I appreciate the lovely views of the area all around Vegas as well as the shots of the town itself - so keep it up CBS, this is one of the best series to come out - I hope there will be many more",1425859200,3,894,4.258823529411765
