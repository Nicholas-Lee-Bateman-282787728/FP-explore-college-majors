D. Gray-man is a great series. It has has action, comedy, and drama. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all pretty good. This series keeps the viewer interested with plot twists, and the introduction of great new characters. I can't find anything not to like about this series. This doesn't have anything to do with season 1, but the anime is unfinished. After the 2nd season the show just stops. I really enjoyed watching this series and it bugs the heck outta me when they just cut it off like they did with this one. They only released 51 episodes, but I think there are actually 103 out there. If you know any news of new D. Gray-man releases I'd appreciate it if you could leave me a comment on it. Anyway, this is a great series and is well worth watching.",1354665600,,1144,4.447619047619048

8349869,5,B0023S4A26,"Let me just start off by saying that this is truly one of the greatest anime's I have ever seen. It's got a little bit of everything, action,comedy, romance, horror. While Part two does leave you hanging, it doesn't leave you with a cliffhanger. The series is still ongoing but the anime is taking a break as it has almost caught up to the manga. I hope that within a year or so they will be able to continue the anime. Until then I definately recommend this series for all dark anime lovers.",1246924800,5,492,4.301075268817204
