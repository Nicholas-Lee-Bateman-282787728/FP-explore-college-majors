2669650,5,B000JCE3N4,"The cop drama and martial arts are great fun but the relationship and history of the two main characters is what this show is really all about. As different as day and night these two still love eachother like father and son at the end of the day. Finding eachother in very original circumstance and in the most unusal of places, these two form a bond that time and differnces can't break. Like nothing that came before or has come since, this show is worth the time.",1204934400,2,467,4.379310344827586
2669651,4,B000JCE3N4,"This brought back some fun memories.  My sister & I enjoyed watching this when it first came out and we enjoyed these DVDs!  The evolving of the relationship between Grady & ""B"" is fun to watch and works well.  The only ""complaint"" is we wished there had been some additional footage such as bloopers or interviews with the cast.
All-in-all well worth the wait!",1200096000,,361,4.609375
2669652,5,B000JCE3N4,I REALLY ENJOY FIRST SEASON OF STREET JUSTICE I HOPE THAT THEY RELEASE THE SECOND SEASON SOON.,1189728000,2,94,4.588235294117647
2669653,4,B000JCE3N4,"What a thrill to see this show available on DVD. I remember watching the show in first run syndication in the early 90's. It was a joy to see an actual television show about a relationship between two men, so often prevailing attitudes do not allow such a thing.

Carl Weathers was great, and Bryan Genesee was very likable in his role, as well as a terrific martial artist. Too bad his career never went past B-movie status.",1188086400,4,425,4.448717948717949

8149852,4,B000JCE3N4,Carl Weathers does a good job. Not enough action in the episodes.,1414281600,,65,4.5
8149853,5,B000JCE3N4,"A great show I watched it when it premiered in '91 thru '93, I just loved Grady Jamieson played by Bryan Genesee a great martial artist and actor, a great show I loved it when I was 11 or 12 years old when it came out. It suited me just fine, I was happy to get a complete series DVD collection. I was so excited when I found this tv series on Amazon.com and it only cost me  thirty bucks to order it and get to my house In about 3 or 4 days. In fact i'm watching Season 2 @the moment I'm up to episode crosswise. Good episode so f I am in such a good mood at the moment.",1408924800,,571,3.71900826446281
8149854,5,B000JCE3N4,I spent about five years wanting to be Grady on this show. It was the best television memory of my childhood. I was so bummed when it was cancelled.,1398211200,,148,4.137931034482759
8149855,5,B000JCE3N4,anyone that grew up in the 80s-90s with a background in kickass tv shows would remember street justice and should 100% get the DVD... sucks about the ending...,1380499200,,159,4.714285714285714
8149856,5,B000JCE3N4,"My adult son was looking for a set of ""Street Justice"" DVDs. When I found these on Amazon, he was thrilled.",1354752000,2,107,4.142857142857143
8149857,5,B000JCE3N4,This was a short lived show that had great action yet unfortunately was not well marketed. It had particularly good story lines for the time and excellent martial arts sequences. Only regret is this series did not last longer.,1256688000,2,226,4.82051282051282
8149858,3,B000JCE3N4,"Street Justice is one of those shows that independant networks would buy either to fill a late night or a Saturday afternoon slot.

It was okay as a cop show. It had all the factors...an Older cop with a younger partner...Canadian location to look like New York...and formula plots. IT filled a void on a saturday afternoon.

And now on DVD, I can watch them all and still thrill to the show. A show like this may not be a major draw, but its like popcorn and will fill you up

8149859,5,B000JCE3N4,"I used to watch this show in the early '90s and was disappointed it only ran for two seasons. Carl Weathers made an excellent ""straight-as-an-arrow-cop"" and Bryan Genesse can not only kick some butt - he looks mighty fine doing it! I was very excited to find the first season DVD set. Now that I own it and have been able to ""walk down memory lane,"" my only regret is that the second season is not available!!",1223856000,,409,4.324675324675325
