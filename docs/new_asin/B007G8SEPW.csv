5084776,3,B007G8SEPW,"Interesting entry from this Columbia B picture series.  Unlike Boston Blackie, the comedy is supplied by the sidekick Eric Blore and it is not overdone, letting the murder be solved progressively by the Lone Wolf.  Good show made all the more enjoyable by an excellent transfer.",1341446400,8,278,5.021739130434782

8516208,5,B007G8SEPW,"I have always loved the Warren William as the Lone Wolf because he plays the part so well.  I also love the fact that the plot is so unpredictable.  I never know ""who done it"" until the very end & most of the time I am good at predicting endings.",1429228800,2,246,3.9

8516214,4,B007G8SEPW,"With 29 of his 65 movies now available on DVD, and a recently published comprehensive biography (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-William-Magnificent-Scoundrel-of-Pre-Code-Hollywood/dp/0786448784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren William: Magnificent Scoundrel of Pre-Code Hollywood</a>) finally available, it's been a banner year for fans of actor Warren William.  Largely forgotten due to his untimely death in 1948 at the young age of 53, the increased interest in ""Pre-Code"" Hollywood films and their availability on DVD along with showings on Turner Classic Movies has introduced younger movie buffs to his timeless wit and debonair charms. Over six feet tall and suavely handsome with a deep rich voice and a marked resemblance to a younger John Barrymore, moustache and all, William was soon a top-billed star.  Many of his early characters had little sense of decency and little self-doubt.  Adapt at playing aggressively amoral, but outwardly charming rogues with and without conscience, he excelled as unscrupulous lawyers, heartless businessmen, con-men, cads and hard-hearted seducers with a calloused exterior masking an even-more-calloused soul.  He excelled in the racy, sexy, but realistic Pre-Code films. When the Production Code went into effect, William adapted playing a variety or roles, dramatic (""Madame X,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Imitation-of-Life/dp/B0068FZ0W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Imitation of Life</a>""), historic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleopatra/dp/B001QFFBAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Cleopatra""</a>, ""The Man In The Iron Mask""), musicals (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gold-Diggers-of-1933/dp/B000E0OE2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Gold Diggers of 1933""</a>, ""The Firefly"") and comedic (""Go West Young Man"").  But William's most entertaining later career films were Crime Mysteries. He played an ersatz Sam Spade (renamed Ted Shayne) in the 2nd ""Maltese Falcon"" remake ""Satan Met a Lady,"" two shots at Philo Vance (""The Dragon Murder Case"" and ""The Gracie Allen Murder Case""), was the first Perry Mason in four adaptations (that BEG for a set), and for Columbia from 1939-43 as Michael Laynard aka The Lone Wolf in nine films.  Three of these have been recently released as SONY CHOICE COLLECTION ""made to order"" CD-R's, the last,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passport-To-Suez/dp/B005DL6PO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passport To Suez</a>, the penultimate,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Counter-Espionage/dp/B005DL6PDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Counter-Espionage</a>, and the third, our reviewed ""The Lone Wolf Meets A Lady.""  The picture quality is outstanding!  Crisp, clear Black & White with a touch of grain but nary a scratch or speckle.  No extras whatsoever, a trailer would have sufficed, but trailers from all the films would've been heaven (I CAN dream...).  William's rapport with his butler/side-kick/former-partner-in-crime, Eric Blore's Jamison, is perfect, just enough comic banter without lapsing into ""schtick,"" plus Blore's character has a wily mind of his own, unlike poor Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Holmes adaptations.  His vocal dislike of the police and fond memories of a life of crime provide many a fun moment.  Also welcomed was a cameo from Shemp Howard as a pickpocket!  The plot about a stolen necklace that sets a string of murders in motion is adequate, but the interaction between the characters, like Laynard's with police inspector and plant aficionado Crane (a wonderful Thurston Hall) is what makes B-pictures so entertaining.  Cross your fingers and purchase these DVD's, hopefully there'll be more to come.......
