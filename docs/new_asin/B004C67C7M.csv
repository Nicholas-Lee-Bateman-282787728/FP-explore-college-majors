8422815,5,B004C67C7M,"I can't recall ever seeing a more realistic treatment of German occupation in World War II. Even now with most of the participants in WWII long dead, all of Hollywood seems to remain in propaganda mode on this subject, i.e. all WWII films must depict German soldiers as evil Nazis and all others in occupied Europe as brave soldiers of the resistance. This series, which is a British production ca. 1978-80, is remarkably different. It shows fanaticism by the minority on both sides, but most of the characters lack those deep convictions and instead understand themselves to be minor players in a much larger drama, just trying to survive without undue compromise. The result is an engrossing human drama which accurately depicts history.",1522540800,,739,5.016260162601626
