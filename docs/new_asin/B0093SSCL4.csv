8535340,5,B0093SSCL4,"This is an easy to watch 1957 western with no shooting; in fact, the hero does not wear a gun except in one scene when he does not use it. He is a stranger who comes to what seems to be a friendly town. We do not know who he is or why he came. He discovers that all the town people are engaged in drilling an oil well on land that he understands belongs to an Indian. He does not know what happened to the Indian. He later understands that the Indian was hung. He does not know why. People call the Indian Joe Dakota, but the stranger says he is Joe Dakota. A local young woman falls in love with him and helps him.",1519603200,,615,3.888888888888889

8535342,5,B0093SSCL4,"An actor & a great stuntman,JOCK MAHONEY stars in a Universal-International ""b""western..BUT CLASSIC.
Notice how he walks too. I heard it's from a accident when he was a stuntman. But he walks..""TALL"".UNIVERSAL has so many,many,western classic from the 1950's..that never were released to dvd. This is one of them. I have a dvd print...not bad..had it a long time got it from a video store out of state. A great cast. Playing good guys & not bad guys are Claude Akins & Lere Van Cleef playing brothers. They work great together. A great part of the western is Jock Mahoney & Charles McGraw fighting in OIL!! A real classic fight. Made in 1957. Mahoney plays a stranger..seeking out who killed his friend,Joe Dakota. Luana Patten plays the young girl of interest to Jock. She also was the child star in ""SONG OF THE SOUTH"".Sadly she has passed away at the age of 57 in 1996.  Universal-International made the best of the West in 1950's..however..they just don't release them,sadly.
If and when...DO BUY IT..I WILL..if I live long enough. LOL.Hard to believe foreign dvd's of OUR MOVIES are out there..but won't work on U.S. dvd's. Why they have them & we don't. It doesn't make any reason why we don't have them for US.",1378944000,,1217,4.713615023474178
8535343,5,B0093SSCL4,"awesome english language version of great 50s western, starring great stuntman-action hero jock mahoney, promptly and securely received, great value",1360281600,2,148,6.45
8535344,5,B0093SSCL4,"The best 'B' movie western of all time starring the great Jock Mahoney. Something of a mystery 'oater', there's a good twist about the name. Plenty of action, but without any of Mahoney's trade-mark stunts that he performed, particularly in his much under-rated western series Yancy Derringer (now available!). The double-gorgeous female leads of Luana Patten and Barbara Lawrence help things along supported by a who's who of screen heavies (some of who don't turn out to be villains in this one) Lee Van Cleef, Claude Atkins, Anthony Caruso, but eclipsed by the talented, gravel-voiced Charles McGraw. A highlight is Mahoney singing snippets of the title song, he didn't have a bad voice. The story was part-written by William Talman, for those old enough to remember, Hamilton Burger in the original Perry Mason series. Far too expensive at 23 quid (English colloquial for s) in my view, so I'll have to wait a few more years before I invest, those of you rich enough though, go for it.",1350172800,,989,4.892857142857143
