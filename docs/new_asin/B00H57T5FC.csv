6132918,4,B00H57T5FC,"Blue Ray is very nice, but for animation it doesn't make a remarkable difference.  I really like having all of season 2, as you can never catch all of the episodes on Disney XD in the correct order.  Too bad this series is over, as it was much better than the current Avengers Assemble, which seems more geared toward pre-teen and early teen group.  The extras on the DVD are not that big of a deal, more like re-tread ways of showing the existing animation and stories.  One of them has factoids from Marvel Universe in it, but none of it provided additional footage or behind the scences stuff.

I was big Avengers collector of the comic in the 70s and 80s, so these stories do a good job of attracting an old school comics fan without turning away today's fan.  I'd say this video is more for serious and adult fans (late teens onward) that really enjoyed the stories.  The episodes do a good job in continuing story lines across multiple episodes, so it really has an extended story line feel to it.  These are more serious stories without the annoying humor and animated cut-aways targeted at ""pre-teen"" and ""early teen"" viewers shown in the current Spiderman, Hulk, and Avengers cartoon series on Disney XD.

Plenty of other non-Avengers type heros shown in the series too, such Wolverine, Thing, Power Man, Iron Fist, Invisible Girl, and Mr. Fantastic.",1416182400,10,1359,4.652719665271967

6132920,5,B00H57T5FC,"The Amazon in Canada(Amazon.ca) has these blu-rays for much cheaper. I paid $33.00 for season one & two, (Prices have risen considerably since I wrote this, however it shows that the set is unavailable now from U.S. Amazon so it's still worth checking Amazon.ca.) that's including postage. Type in: The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Seasons 1-2 (Amazon Exclusive) [Blu-ray]. Or they are also available individually.

Season two of Avengers, Earth's Mightiest Heroes has the complete 26 episodes on two blu-ray discs. Both packaged in the regular blu-ray case with the discs on spindles, one on each side of the opened case. Behind the discs are the episode lists.
Season two episodes are in a different order than the dvds.

  Blu-ray season 2 disc 1 compared to Vol 5 two dvd set:

  1. The Private War Of Doctor Doom
  2. Alone Against A.I.M.
  3. Acts Of Vengeance
  4. Welcome To The Kree Empire
  5. To Steal An Ant-Man
  6. Michael Korvac  (The first 6 are in the same order as the dvd)
  7. Who Do You Trust?  (v5 #8 on the dvd)
  8. The Ballad Of Betta Ray Bill (v5 #7 on the dvd)
  9. Nightmare in Red (v5 #10 on the dvd)
  10. Prisoner Of War (v5 #12 on the dvd)
  11. Infiltration (also #11 on the dvd)
  12. Secret Invasion (v5 #13 on the dvd)
  13. Along Came A Spider...(v6 #1 on the dvd)
  14. Behold The Vision (v5 #9 on the dvd)

  The dvd vol. 5 exclaimes an exclusive Never-Before-Seen Episode  ""Powerless""  but that's just one less episode for vol. 6.

  Blu-ray season 2 disc 2 compared to Vol 6 two dvd set:

  15. Powerless  (dvd vol. 5 has this as an exclusive Never-Before-Seen  Episode but that's just one less episode for vol. 6.)
  16. Assault on 42 (v6 #2 on the dvd)
  17. Ultron Unlimited (v6 #3 on the dvd)
  18. Yellow Jacket (v6 #4 on the dvd)
  19. Emperor Starl (v6 #5 on the dvd)
  20. Code Red (v6 #6 on the dvd)
  21. Winter Soldier (v6 #7 on the dvd)
  22. The Deadliest Man Alive (v6 #8 on the dvd)
  23. New Avengers (v6 #9 on the dvd)
  24. Operation Galactic Storm (v6 #10 on the dvd)
  25. Live Kree Or Die (v6 #11 on the dvd)
  26. Avengers Assemble! (v6 #12 on the dvd - there is no episode #13 on the dvd set Vol. 6 because there were 14 episodes on vol. 5.)

  That's it, 26 episodes for each season. Verily, one of the most incredible animation collections on the planet. And the blu-ray set is stunning in color, sharpness, sound, etc. It's a must have collection for any Marvel fan young or old. Not released in the U.S.(yet?) it is being sold as an import from Canada. If the Amazon sellers prices are to high, you can get it at Amazon.ca at an excellent price. I paid $33.00 for both seasons direct from Amazon.ca and that included the postage. It's just as easy to buy from the Canadian Amazon and the exchange rate is around $1=$1.",1409702400,12,2792,4.291828793774319

6132922,5,B00H57T5FC,"This was a great series for 2 seasons. The roster rotated some episodes but kept the main core focused as it delved into their back which is rarely seen in animation, as it is always action, action, action. Ms Marvel, Black Panther, wasp, the Skrulls and Kree, Mar-Vell, and others were featured. Great add to collection.",1405814400,7,321,4.75
6132923,4,B00H57T5FC,"26 episodes on glorious Blu-Ray.

Season 2 of The Avengers takes a step back.  The real Captain America is missing for a significant part of the season, as is the Hulk.  The best Hank Pym I've seen in animation is replaced by Yellowjacket.  Yuck.  Tony Stark again gets a chance to show that he is the villain of the show (Emperor Stark) as well as the star (He gets rid of Galactus, completely ignoring that the Big G has a role in the Universe).

The Hulk has a point, as the Avengers didn't seem to work too hard to get him released.

Still, it's pretty good overall.  I agree with my wife that it's no Batman:TAS or Justice League Unlimited, but it is quite watchable.

As the show was cancelled, we do get a finale in the last episode, but poor Amora is still a victim of Surtur.

There actually are a couple of Special Features this time that aren't just interviews.

No subtitles.

Multiple people have asked, so I checked, and the order of episodes matched what I saw on that site that Amazon doesn't want me to name.",1397952000,14,1025,4.336842105263158

6132952,3,B00H57T5FC,Its pretty good for marvel animation. DC animated cartoons when it comes to voice acting and choice of background music will always be better in my opinion like justice league or young justice. but marvel animation voice acting/ music editing/ story telling is not as good as their live movie counterparts like Thor and Captain America winter soldier. But I'm sure someday they will get the hang of it. but avengers is better then all the marvel animated stuff they did before except for spectacular spider-man.,1428624000,,511,4.953488372093023

6132956,5,B00H57T5FC,"If you're buying this then I don't need to tell you how awesome this series is. Sadly despite it's awesomeness it has yet to receive a North American Bluray release, or even DVD season sets. In Canada however they were released, which makes this an import. First I will say that these are much cheaper on Amazon.ca. I paid $26 for both seasons which included shipping. The only down side is I had to wait almost a month for them to arrive.

Once it did though I was quite pleased. While it's a bit annoying that everything on the package is written in French as well a English that alone is a pretty minor complaint. Inside under the disk trays are lists of episodes which is a nice touch. The disks themselves each house 13 episodes.  The Bluray itself is not entirely in English like the prior disk but that's minor. Though still annoying because it asks what language up front yet has both.  The HD transfer is flawless and looks as good as any other animated series I own.

All in all I am quite happy with this. I am unsure if it will ever get a North American release on Bluray like Wolverine and the X-men or Spectacular Spider-man. Both those series were produced by different studios and released under other labels. Even if they are released these sets are more then ""worthy"". The only reason I could see buying any future release is if you prefer the package art.

Bottom line if you like the show then this is a must buy. If you don't mind waiting I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon.ca over here to get it at the best price.",1423008000,3,1543,4.4
