By the way if you get the chance, see them. Can't say to much else about the movie itself, but if you are a Lordi fan, you will love it.",1227139200,,307,3.7384615384615385
3521813,4,B001D262JW,"What's to say about this interesting gem? Well I know the concept of a band being in a movie usually has a comical feel behind it, but the fact that this is in the horror genre takes an original spin to it. At first buying a movie I hadn't seen first was a bit risky because I usually wait until I've seen the movie to judge whether or not it's worthy to buy on DVD. Luckily after going against my rule I bought a horror movie with a basic yet unravelling plot, traditional horror where characters have conflicts with each other and a twist occurring at every Opportunity. Overall this movie was pretty awesome and I recommend any fan of Lordi to get this movie.",1226793600,2,662,4.304
3521814,2,B001D262JW,"I've been a fan of Lordi for six years now, meaning that I was listening to their music long before they won Eurovision and gained international fame. Thus far, I have loved everything the band has done, including their 2004 short film, ""The Kin"". Needless to say, I was excited when the band first announced their plans to make a full-length horror movie. It made sense: of all the bands in the world, which would be better suited to make a movie about monsters than the Finnish ambassadors of shock rock? The film originally premiered in February 2008, but I endured an extra ten months for the DVD release. This proved a wise decision, as it turned out, for had I been in a theater, the monsters themselves would likely have come down to tell me to stifle my groans of disappointment.

The story: Sarah (Skye Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-the-Dark/dp/B001MLZNKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against the Dark</a>) is a little girl suffering from an unknown mental illness. When her father (Noah Huntley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B0031EDXFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>) attempts to remove her from the hospital, they and a group of strangers comprised of a benevolent nurse (Dominique McElligot, ""On Home Ground""), a brave security guard (Leon Herbert, ""The Paradise Club""), a paranoid commuter (William Hope,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B000G6BM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>), and a disturbed homeless man (Ronald Pickup, ""Waters of the Moon"") find themselves trapped in the building as it undergoes a dark transformation and becomes filled with bloodthirsty monsters.

I tried approaching this movie in different ways, trying to make it work for me. First, as a showcase for the band and their onstage personas; this didn't work, since the monsters have disappointingly little screentime. Secondly, as an '80s-style splatter film, since Lordi draw much of their inspiration from this medium; didn't work either, since there's very little blood and gore and, again, few monster moments. Finally, I tried to watch it as a movie that intentionally confused the audience, and this may work best since the film offers absolutely absolutely no enlightenment after leaving the audience in the dark for so long with the unexplained the twists, turns, and other weirdo plot elements. I'm left to believe that the filmmakers themselves lost track of what kind of story they were trying to tell, since the film is so convoluted and stingy in giving hints that would explain what's happening. It's been pointed out before, and I'll reinforce the complaint: there is no explanation as to why the hospital transformed, what the monsters are doing there, or what Sarah's condition is. Some aspects from ""The Kin"" are present - the manipulating of time and space and the horror of life after death - but they only make the film's plot a bigger mystery never to be solved. It's really frustrating, even for a fan.

If you're counting on the fear of the unknown to tide you over, I'm afraid that the film isn't very scary, either. Reliance on cheap jolt scares are a death knell, seeing as there's nothing very frightening about slow-motion shots of windows and walls exploding. The monsters themselves also look very much out of place: with the exception of Awa and Lordi, their costumes don't even fit into the film's art design, and will have viewers who are unfamiliar with the band wondering if Kita's armor, OX's nose ring, or Amen's being a mummy have anything to do with the solution to the plot. The acting also needs help: even though they're playing cardboard characters you've seen in a thousand other horror movies, Hope, Herbert, and Pickup especially need to spend a few lessons with their acting coaches, and Skye Bennett will start annoying viewers before she arouses sympathy.

I'm not sure if I can accurately express how disappointed I am in this movie. True, maybe I was foolish to expect anything great from a film made about a rock band (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Meets-the-Phantom-of-the-Park/dp/B000FSF30O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park</a>&nbsp;should have taught me better), but for all that seems to have gone into its production, you'd think that they could have done just a bit better. Director Pete Riski should've known that he was not shooting a music video and Mr. Lordi should've known that fans were expecting more from him and his group than cameos and a poorly-composed plot. I'm afraid that the only folks who'll be interested in this film are fans of the band, but then again, like me, they too will be struggling to stay awake.",1226620800,11,4845,5.481927710843373
3521815,3,B001D262JW,"While going through the lineup of the batch of Ghost House Underground flicks, I came across Dark Floors without knowing that heavy metal band Lordi was starring in it.  I'm far from being a big fan of the band, and often have trouble keeping my laughter to myself when I see them in their monster outfits, of which they appear here as demons stalking a handful of people in a hospital after time has mysteriously stopped.  Could the key to surviving lie with a young autistic girl (Skye Bennett)?  Or are these beasts just simply out for blood?  It's hard to keep track of what all is really going on in Dark Floors, as the film is unapologetic at completely explaining itself.  Still, Dark Floors does boast some impressive production values for a flick of this type, and the set design of the hospital is dreary and creepy.  All in all, Dark Floors is worth a look for horror fans, and especially so if you're a fan of Lordi.",1225756800,,928,4.461538461538462
3521816,3,B001D262JW,"The full title of this film is apparently ""Dark Floors: The Lordi Motion Picture,"" which is important because&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lordi/dp/B000AA4FU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lordi</a>&nbsp;is a heavy metal group from Finland that dresses up in elaborate monster-like costumes.  I was not really aware of this and since I had never heard of the group before was not able to recognize them when Mr. Lordi, OX, Amen, Awa, and Kita starting popping up as the monsters in this 2008 movie (and, of course, they have recorded a new song, ""Beast Loose in Paradise,"" for the end credits).  This matters because since I did not know these guys from Adam, there were just monsters.  Imagine, if you will, that this was ""Dark Floors: The Kiss Motion Picture,"" and every time Space Ace, Starchild, Catman or the Demon popped up you would laugh you ass off (I say this remembering full well that the band popped up as superheroes in several Marvel comics, including both ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-The-Duck/dp/0785108319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard The Duck</a>"" and a magazine printed with REAL KISS BLOOD).  Actually, Lordi looks more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GWAR/dp/B00000ICNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GWAR</a>, the thrash metal band than Kiss, but either way you understand the principle.  For fans of Lordi, this movie has an inherent comic element that we ignorant types are not burdened.  Also, know going in that while half of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-House-Underground/dp/B001ECDVGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost House Underground</a>&nbsp;films released on DVD this October are dubbed, ""Dark Floors"" is not.

Young Sarah (Skye Bennet) is autistic and with health problems, but the hospital cannot come up with any answers, so her father, Ben (Noah Huntley), wants to take her out of there.  But the elevator breaks down and they, along with the others in the elevator, find that when the doors open the hospital is deserted.  and we quickly get the feeling that we are not in Helsinki any more.  Lordi, no.  As they move from floor to floor, things get progressively more decrepit and more dangerous.  Of course the ability of any of this group to get out of the hospital alive relies on Sarah, because she is autistic, and what we do not know about autism can work as the deus ex machina in any horror movie.  Besides, when people check out the phones in this hospital there are whispered requests demands for the girl, so even the people in the movie know that Sarah is the key.  The other characters along for the ride are Emily (Dominique McElligott), who is clearly a bit smarter and braver than the guys she is stuck with, which are Jon (William Hope), Walter (Philip Bretherton), Rick (Leon Herbert), and Tobias (Ronald Pickup), the crazy old coot who is the only one with a clue and who handles the requisite exposition duties.

The working title in Finnish for this film was ""Punainen liitu,"" which translates as ""Red Chalk,"" and actually is more appropriate for the plot here since the floors in this film are not particularly dark (and when they get dirty so do the walls and ceilings).  I think that the vibe this movie was going for was like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Hill/dp/B000GCFO0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Hill</a>,"" with the whole ""what the hell is happening here?"" vibe, more than any other recent horror movie that comes to mind.  My complaint with Lordi is not that these are heavy metal guys running around in monster costumes, because since I had never seen them before that was easy to forget.  Instead my problem is that the movie ends up being like a fun house at Halloween, where you go through the thing and periodically monsters jump out, you jump, they disappear, and you keep going.  Being the monsters in a horror movie would appear to be self-indulgent at face value, but the five band members pretty much have the smallest roles. Director Pete Riski does not come up with anything special for this horror film, but then there is nothing special being set up by Pekka Lehtosaari's script.

The bottom line is that if I knew who Lordi was then I probably would have laughed every time one of them showed up, but I did not, so I was able to actually take this movie at face value.  There is very little blood and gore, and the oppressive atmosphere quickly dissipates because there is no real sense of moving towards a climax because why this movie telegraphs from the opening moment that the little girl is going to save the day, there is no real sense of what she is saving them from.  I suppose a case could be made for the horrors of existentialist angst, but there is just grabbing for straws to try and make sense of this film.  Besides, because of the limitations of the young actress playing Sarah, the character works best when she is not saying anything, so she is unable to carry the off the big finish when she has to start talking.  The end game reminded me of what I thought was the best film of 2006, which is why I round up on ""Dark Floors,"" but I do not want to ruin the best part of the film if you decide to check it out (I think it will be obvious).  This is not the best (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-of-the-Dead/dp/B001D262LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance of the Dead</a>"") or even one of the better (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Substitute/dp/B001D262KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Substitute</a>"") DVDs in this GHU collection, but it is definitely in the middle and not one of the really bad ones.",1225324800,3,5847,5.384868421052632

Now the bad stuff. The rest of the movie! There is not much of a story to speak of, no character development, the writing is just awful, there isn't even that much gore. It seems that this is a vehicle to promote a Heavy Metal band from Finland called Lordi. Remember Gwar? Same thing. A group of self proclaimed rock stars in stupid monster costumes. The plot has something to do with a little girl living in a nightmare, or just having one, you really can't tell which one. I even saw some of the plot from ""Silent Hill"" in there for some reason.

There is a plot element of time loops, frozen time and overlapping characters (which is the whole thrust of the excellent Triangle) which is cool. You might say that this is just sloppy writing intended to creep you out without making any sense, but the nightmare tone is appropriate to the horror genre (and what may in fact be a child's fantasy). My big complaint is that the monsters mostly look like what they are, a bunch of critters from a Kiss knockoff band. But the acting and production are pretty solid. Not nearly as terrible as some are saying, it isn't going to make anyone forget Psycho or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre either.

I can tell you this, Dark Floors is nothing more than a few scenes of good SFX and sound.

It seems to be just another churned out scary movie for ppl to buy and nothing else.

3521839,4,B001D262JW,"I saw this movie on tv a couple of days ago, and fell in love with instantly. I like the idea behind the movie, but I REALLY wish they would have shown EXACTLY what happened in that blasted hospital that started it all. WHY did the demons attack, kill everybody except the little girl, her dad, and the people with them. Why does the homeless man be the only one who remembers every time the little girl 'reboots' everything with her mysterious power?

What happened inside the hospital to cause it to be over run by those monsters to begin with? How long has the little girl been rebooting everything back to the day everything went to pot? Where did her power come from? Was she the target of the demons from the beginning when the hospital invasion first started, or did they start targeting her after the first reboot because they want to get out of their too now? How and why did the hospital staff and patients all die, when moment ago they were alive and conversing with the 'survivors' before they got on the elevator? how did that one doctor who had been treating the little girl, get the idea that they should hand her over to the demons to begin with before he was killed as well with his voice recorder device recording his final words? What happened?!

We need a prequel to Dark Floors to find out EXACTLY what the heck happened inside that hospital BEFORE the main characters got trapped insise the hospital. It obviously happened when they got in the elevator and it suddenly stopped for a few minutes before starting up again, but since the loop never seems to END, then what HAPPENED in the rest of the hospital that led to everyone else turning up missing/dead, while the elevator gang seems to be the only survivors of whatever happened outside the elevator that led to it becoming a haunted hospital of horrors with ghostly monsters wanting them dead? How long have they been in the loop? Has anyone from outside the hospital tried coming in to find out what was going on when they lost contact with everybody in the hospital? Or is the world outside the hospital just as bad outside as it is inside the hospital?",1391212800,,2133,4.5090439276485785

3521868,3,B001D262JW,"Dark Floors (2008) is a Finnish supernatural horror thriller, that takes you on a weird journey through the wards of a hospital.  The story is atmospheric, and the special effects are mostly well executed, but the plot is slow moving, and a bit all over the place, as the characters make their way through what appears to be an alternate reality.  Director Pete Riski and Tomi Putaansuu, better known as ""Mr. Lordi"", came up with the story.  Lordi, and his four bandmates in the metal band Lordi, appear in the film as malevolent ghosts, demons, or monsters.

A young girl named Sarah (Skye Bennett) is a patient in a hospital, and after an accident occurs while she is having an MRI, her father Ben (Noah Huntley), decides to take her home in the middle of the night.  Wheeling Sarah in a wheelchair, Ben enters an elevator on the eighth floor, as Emily (Dominique McElliot) a nurse, attempts to talk him out of leaving.  Riding down with several other passengers, something strange occurs and the car jerks to a stop.  Eventually the doors open on the sixth floor, which appears to be deserted.  The setting is quite eerie, as the group sees no one, until they encounter a woman with her eyes gouged out.

Retreating in fear, they enter a stairwell, and move down one floor to the fifth, which is also deserted.  Acting as a group, these people are remarkably clueless, and Ben is continually losing track of his daughter.  When a ghost suddenly appears, Rick (Leon Herbet) a security guard, fires his gun with no effect, as the group heads down to the fourth floor.  Breaking from the pack, Jon (William Hope) attempts to take an elevator down, but is attacked and wounded by some kind of monster, before being rescued by the others.  It appears that Sarah is somehow the key to the strange events.  The survivors continue to work their way downwards to try and reach safety, but a deadly journey lies ahead for those who manage to stay alive.

Dark Floors is a fantasy where anything can happen, but with a freehand to do almost anything, the direction the story takes is somewhat disappointing.  Even after seeing what they have seen, these people are trudging along with no sense of urgency to get out, seemingly unafraid for their lives.  Putting his daughter's life in the wrong hands, Ben is a guy with questionable judgment, and major problems maintaining focus on the task at hand.  Watching him gets to be increasingly frustrating, as he's painfully slow to react, and is kind of a bungler.  The film would be more effective if a solid emotional connection was established with Sarah, but she remains mostly a mystery, and a person that is difficult to really care about.  You might expect that some endearing quality might emerge about her, but it just doesn't happen.  While things seem to end well, it's hardly uplifting.

Dark Floors is a slow moving atmospheric thriller with good production values, that for better or worse, features each of the members of the band Lordi to fairly good effect.  A reoccurring element involving loops in time, doesn't seem to add much to a story that is a more than a little obscure.",1316908800,,3134,4.6996336996337
3521869,2,B001D262JW,"After briefly being trapped in a hospital elevator during a power outage a man and his autistic daughter, along with a nurse, a security guard, an old man, and a business man, find themselves in a hospital that somehow became abandoned in the intervening minutes. It soon becomes apparent that something has happened to them and that the hospital is filling up with malicious creatures intent on getting what they want no matter who they have to go through to get it.

Stylistically, the movie is a slam dunk. Initially trapped several floors up, the hospital and its contents undergo a very effective rotting, aging effect as the characters make their way toward the ground floor and what they presume to be an exit. Walls, doors and equipment show fatigue and the entire hospital seems to close in around them creating a surprisingly effective atmosphere. Equally effective is the slowly unraveling realization that this is not the first time they've been here and that it all revolves around the autistic daughter in some way.

If they'd have stuck with those plot devices and the equally effective eerie sound effects this would have been a surprisingly good psychological horror film. It's not particularly graphic so all the of the chills can be portrayed by playing on actual fears, and all but one of the characters are actually likable enough that you want them to make it (and the one that's not likable isn't supposed to be).

Unfortunately, Lordi shows up.

Lordi is a Finnish metal band that dresses up in weird ""monster"" outfits before going on stage to perform (similar to acts like Gwar). While this sort of cheesy, goofball stunt may entertain metal heads in the frozen expanse of Finland, their paper mache and rubber-faced presence absolutely ruins this movie by completely and instantly removing all believability. Watching a large man dressed like a pig in armor chase a normal looking fellow through an otherwise spooky hospital is just too hilariously stupid to be scary.

The one saving grace is that the Lordi-monsters aren't particularly threatening so they don't really get much screen time. One is easily dispatched when the autistic girl looks at it funny, another is thrown off an elevator shaft, one falls out a window, and yet another is simply killed outright by a crippled old man. The only one that isn't a complete wuss actually works in-costume without ruining all of the mood, but his character still works better as a formless blob of creeping rot and would have been better off not being shown.

Overall, it really is unfortunate that this movie chose to include a bunch of large men in goofy costumes chasing the main characters around what was an otherwise creepy and menacing hospital. If they'd simply left the presence chasing after the characters as nameless and faceless it would have been an unusually smart, interesting horror movie. It still wouldn't be a great movie, but it would have been better than most of the pointless, boring gorefests that studios try to pass off as ""scary"" anymore. Sadly, that's not what they did, and with the presence of Lordi the movie is simply ripped from the category of creepy and deposited firmly into the category of campy, and for that I can only say that you might as well just avoid it so you also avoid the disappointment that comes from watching it.",1314316800,2,3341,4.852631578947369

I had no idea this flick was subtitled ""The Lordi Motion Picture"" until I was about thirty minutes into it, bored, and looking it up on IMDB. I originally committed it to the DVR because Philip Bretherton is in the cast list; I'm an unrepentant As Time Gos By fanboy, and if a member of the principal cast shows up in anything, I'll watch it. Let me save you the trouble: he's actually in the movie for less than five minutes. Just a bit too long to be called a cameo, but nowhere near enough for the fourth billing he gets. So, yeah, five minutes of Alistair Deacon vs. eighty-five minutes of a second-rate Gwar knockoff. You tell me if it's worth it.

Plot: Ben (<em>28 Days Later...</em>'s Noah Huntley) is at the hospital with his daughter Sarah (<em>the Pillars of the Earth</em>'s Skye Bennett), who's autistic, for some routine tests when things start going weird. First, after a power fluctuation, the MRI machine Sarah is in catches on fire. Then, on the way back to the room, a schizophrenic old man, whose name, we later learn, is Tobias (<em>Never Say Never Again</em>'s Ronald Pickup), stops them in the hallway, whispers something into Sarah's ear, and seems to bless her. Despite the urging of her nurse, Emily (<em>Moon</em>'s Dominique McElligott), Ben decides he wants to take Sarah home rather than keeping her in the hospital to complete the tests. When they get on the elevator, Emily in tow, they're joined by Tobias and a guard, Rick (<em>Alien 3</em>'s Leon Herbert), and a hospital executive, Jon (<em>Aliens</em>' William Hope). When the power fluctuates again, trapping them in between floors, something happens; when it comes back on, the elevator dumps them off on the sixth floor instead of in the lobby, and the hospital is deserted. Except for them... and a bunch of interdimensional monsters who want something from them, played by members of the band Lordi (in their usual makeup).

This is all well and good, and that's a surprisingly competent cast when you think about it. But the plot of the movie ends up being defined by the band's mythology, which kinda makes sense if you think about it (that the movie is defined by it, not the mythology itself... which I assume was the product of a great deal of ingested licit and illicit substances). Which also wouldn't necessarily be a problem. Worldbuilding is done, and done well, in movies all the time. But no explanation is given here. Whether the assumption was that no one but Lordi fans would see the movie or that those who saw it wouldn't care what was going on I don't know, but it had to be one of them. Why? Unless you're familiar with the band's mythology, what happens in this movie makes not a lick of sense. And even those casually familiar with it (e.g., me) may have a hard time following along.

As well, this is, you know, supposed to be a horror movie. That would be stretching the case a little. Did you watch the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries version of <em>The Stand</em> fifteen-ish years ago? Remember towards the beginning, when Stu Redman (Gary Sinise) tries to get out of the hospital after everyone else has bought it? In the book, that scene is kinda terrifying, but in the miniseries, it's more about determination and perseverance; it's sad, but it's not scary. You can say the same of the hospital journey in this movie, as long as you retool the definition of ""sad"" to be closer to ""pathetic"". *",1307664000,2,3458,4.720198675496689

3521873,5,B001D262JW,"I hadn't planned on writing a review for this movie, but I felt compelled to do so after I saw the utterly unfair reviews others had written for it. Let's start by clearing up the assertions that this movie *never explains itself *leaves the audience confused. This movie DOES in fact explain itself and it DOES give all the necessary clues to figure out what is going on within the first few minutes in fact, so the only way it leaves the audience confused is if the audience member didn't put the clues together. Hubby and I were glued to the screen and watching every detail trying to figure out what was going on during the movie... that my friends was part of the fun. After it was over we still hadn't figured it out, but after maybe 5 minutes (tops) I realized that a line that had caught my attention at the beginning was one of the major keys to the movie and we unraveled the secrets of the movie in a just a couple minutes from there. As someone who usually anticipates every plot twist in most movies, it was refreshing to watch a movie that I didn't catch onto immediately and had to think about.

To give you a hint, without spoiling it for those that haven't watched it yet, pay attention to what the father says to the nurse (as he is trying to leave with his daughter in the beginning) about what happened in the MRI/CAT scan thing. Then pay attention to what the security guard says about the air conditioning as they start to look around, and look at the walls as they change. That will give you the first part of the equation. To put the 2nd major piece together pay attention to what the *potential spoiler alert* girl says to the monster about light and dark in the garage. A little imagination and you're there. *end spoiler alert*

The acting was decent, the atmosphere creepy and the plot twists engaging. Don't expect a slasher film (very little in the way of blood and guts,) it's much more a psychological thriller with paranormal occurrences. I'd watch it again :)",1301270400,5,1993,4.442622950819672

The characters are mostly one-note: the nurse is concerned, dad is a brave defender of his daughter, the businessman is self-interested and obnoxious. The actors hit those notes well.

The monsters are well-done, and there are several genuinely scary moments in the movie. You know when you hit the climax, and that's when things shift. I like the ending, where resolution is implied rather than stated. You'll know what I mean after you see the movie.

3521876,3,B001D262JW,"A father and his invalid daughter are trapped in a deserted hospital along with several other strangers as the dark hallways come to life with gruesome demons. DARK FLOORS is a stagnant haunted hospital tale that never gets off the ground. It feels like a scrapbook of more successful Horror features butchered in to a single incoherent film where the characters just wander about the halls aimlessly for over an hour. When the occasional demon does appear, the characters are rarely frightened or even stunned. The decayed hospital setting is sufficiently creepy, but the only workable elements of the entire film lie in the creature FX and costuming of the demons themselves. Considering the costumes belonged to the Shock Rocker band Lordi, and that the film was initially conceived as a poor excuse to mass market the band on the international market, it cant even take credit for these creations. DARK FLOORS proves to be a bland, uninspired, and unoriginal Horror film that relies far too heavily on the strength of its villains while forgetting about minor elements like character or plot.

3521878,3,B001D262JW,"Dark Floors is a rare horror film that may entice some viewers but may have them leaving the viewing experience with mixed feelings.  This films starts off on the right foot, setting up a dark tone from the start and placing the audience in the midst of what initially appears to be a great horror film.  The opening scenes are promising; a little girl with a disability is being tested at a hospital for possible treatments.  Always armed with a paper and crayon, the little girl seems to be drawing events before they occur.  This leaves the audience to believe that either she is psychic or she can see the dead.  A plot twist that could add to the overall ""horror"" of the film.

However, the story becomes more complicated when it's revealed to the audience that somehow time has frozen.  This causes a ripple effect on the characters within the film by leaving their past, future, and present selves to all be capable of interacting with one another.  The actors experience encounters with themselves in many instances, including shooting themselves and talking to themselves over the hospital's intercom.  All of these events are gradually explained, all while the cast is busy fighting off various monsters that all seem to be after the young girl, for an undisclosed reason that is never fully revealed to the viewer, making the overall plot very difficult to follow and/or comprehend.  The film, at one point, even has a ""Silent Hill"" type moment where the cast is somehow placed in a different dimension where they cannot interact with the people they see until returning to the alternate world in which they are trapped.  This never truly adds to the film, in fact it only contributes to a higher level of confusion overall for the audience in an already difficult to understand plot.

The film has a nice line up of scares in store for the viewers which range from ""jump"" moments placed at appropriate times, or just overall well done scary moments that include dark hallways, elevators, and an overall dark ambiance that is portrayed.  The lighting and acting is quite good and contributes quite nicely to the feel of the film.  However, no amount of environmental set ups can save Dark Floors from being a hard to understand horror movie.  The film's ending makes you wonder why everything has been occurring the entire time and it makes the viewer believe that the events that just occurred in the film are going to repeat all over again.  This made me ask myself, ""How many times has this already occurred"", a question that is never answered either.  The final encounter between the disabled girl and the lead monster (lead singer of Lordi) makes even less sense.  One would assume that with that encounter occurring that the story could end there, however, the entire situation seems to comes back into play again.  I am a Metal fan, however, I do not like the band ""Lordi"" since their musical style does not fit into my spectrum of taste, but the band did a great job in this movie despite the overall terrible and almost non-existing plot.  I purchased this movie simply because I'm a fan of horror films, however, I could not fully recommend this film to anyone due to the horrendous storyline.  If you're looking for some good scares, a great ambiance and environment, but do not mind trying to figure out a story, then this film may be a good choice.  Had the story been more clear and precise in explaining itself then I could say that this was a good film, but in the form it was written I can simply state that it's mediocre at best.",1262649600,12,3558,4.677367576243981

The acting is decent, and in some places actually fairly good given the nature of low budget horror movies. The plot starts out murky and gets even less clear as the movie progresses. This is a shame because there's an interesting twist half way through the movie where the characters learn they've been pulled out of the space-time continuim and are acting and fighting (in some instances) against themselves. Its a neat idea that a better writer could have fully explored and explained better. However, dragging everything down is the fact its Lodi. Its hard to take this movie too seriously when you know its a band in masks. And some of the masks are just plain bad. In sum - no Lodi and a better writter would equal a bettter movie.

It's cheap entertainment with no messages, and the fun is in the experience. Given that LORDI is the ""reason"" for the film, it seems that each characters abilities are used in the story ( if only KISS could have chosen an appropriate vehicle when they went for a film, and also, the set of wings on the Lead Singer puts Gene Simmons set to shame) , so whilst I have never heard a bit of Lordi prior to this film
( nor am I going to go out and buy some of their albums) it looks like they chose well for a Feature vehicle, and the Singer, as stated in the film commentary, seems to understand mythic conventions in films, and Horror, so the ending is not as wrong as some state( I do find it funny that he has the same manic Laughter as Ace Frehley ).
Anyways, whilst my opinion is that this film is well cast, well scripted and well executed, it will fall into the love it or hate it category.

The point of all of these psychological horror films (Where I'd classify this) is to end with a twist that doesn't leave room for any explanation. I'd rather this type of movie end with a bang rather than a tired twist ending. Though having Lordi maintain their costumes for this film is a novel idea, they brought nothing to the film.

8291088,3,B001D262JW,"If you're a Lordi fan, then seeing the band members as the monsters in this film is perhaps a good enough reason to check it out. They 2006/ECS winning lineup is present, and though they don't get a lot of screen time, they're all there and some effort is made to bring in their individual mythologies (especially Amen). Still, they're not on screen for that long, no Lordi music is used as part of the movie (except for the credits), and as monsters, they're not really that important to the plot other than to provide reasons for the protagonists to run or die. Only Mr. Lordi is significant but only as the embodiment of the evil in this film's alternative dimension.

 If you're not a Lordi fan, Dark Floors is an interesting Silent-Hill-like film that does some things very well but is a mixed bag in so many other ways. It's never a 'bad' horror film, and it's better than some of the bigger budget dreck that comes out. It's highly atmospheric, visually beautiful, and the performances are across the board acceptable if never good or great. The Lordi band members as the monsters sorta work but mostly don't because nothing about them feels inherent in the Silent-Hillish atmosphere of the film. There's no reason for a mummy to be there other than Amen's character is a homage to the classic Mummy horror films; nor do Kita or OX make any inherent sense. Awa and Mr. Lordi come the closest as a ghost and a demonic embodiment of darkness, but still, it's a stretch. Otherwise, it does some smart things by playing with time and reoccurring events that add to the atmospheric quality. None of it, however, ever really rises consistently to good, though moments can be excellent if viewed independently of the film.

To enjoy the film, I think the best way to approach it is to view it as a really interesting fan flick. Mr. Lordi's deep love of American, European, and Japanese horror films and all those different versions of the horror genre comes through, though it's channeled through what I guess must be a kind of Finlandish perspective and then worked back out. None of it completely works, but it borrows enough from so many different manifestations of horror that at times, it does a lot more than the sum of its parts.
