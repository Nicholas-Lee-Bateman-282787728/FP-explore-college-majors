8054342,3,B0007Z0OA4,"Every one of the titles on CHILLING 20 MOVIE PACK are available on other MILL CREEK box sets-- however there is no single package (other than this one) that contains them all. Typically, this DVD company provides a nice mix of lesser-known films at a very fair price-- and such is the case here.
