2259327,5,B0008FXSSS,"Wow - this is a really reat NDN movie - Eddie Spears is great as Black Cloud - really has a great scowl down - wonderful to see this young actor's career take off and really growing with each role he has undertaken.  Rick Schroder - did an excellent job of capturing NDN angst, survival and spirit to continue...

Even though the venue for the movie was boxing - great story line.

2259328,4,B0008FXSSS,"I purchased the movie before even seeing it. I just knew I wanted to see it and keep it as a movie. After reading initial reviews of it, I thought it would be great. I always like good boxing movies, but better yet..I liked good human characters.

Let's see what Ricky can do with this one under his belt and onto bigger better things.

Go BlackCloud!

Go Ricky!",1122854400,2,362,4.294117647058823
2259329,4,B0008FXSSS,"There are several things about this film by Rick Schroder that make it special. One is the location. The cinematography of the beautiful Canyon de Chelly is spectacular.  One has the feeling of a John Ford/John Wayne western at times.  Another plus is the wonderful company of indigenous actors.  Russell Means is a standout as the boxing coach.  Julia Jones is impressive as the single Mom who is in love with a troubled young man played by Eddie Spears. Spears does a good job as a mixed blood Indian youth in the midst of an identity crisis. Tim McGraw's music is an added plus to the film, and it works well. Although McGraw made his acting debut in the film, he seems very natural in the role of the sheriff.  The boxing scenes are very well done, thanks to an adviser who worked on Rocky, The Champ, and a lot of other films of that genre. This is Rick Schroder's tribute to the West that he loves, Native Americans, etc. It's a good debut for him as a filmmaker.",1121212800,17,969,4.391061452513966
2259330,1,B0008FXSSS,"Once again, Hollywood has managed to sneak its head into the what could have been a great Indie film from Ricky Schroeder. Many of the past films based around Native Americans always have flashes of animals whom do not have a purpose around the characters nor plot always plague the story line.

Aside from the horrible senseless script. I have to say that the acting of Eddie Spears is almost as wooden and cranky as Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones.

His character is the typical ""Hollywood Cliche"" of a African-American young thug making it big, through redemption and persistence to get that record contract.

The only person I would have to say almost saved the film was Russell Means. You can feel the sense of the pain his young boxer is going through from his eyes and the way he speaks to his young protege.

Alot of the symbolism and mythology are not exact to Navajo/Dine culture. You can feel the way they try to speak Navajo is utterly wrong and can feel like Adam Beach trying to speak Navajo in ""Windtalkers"".

I live on the Navajo Nation and most young Navajo do not appreciate their culture as that Eddie Spears portrays in the film. They do not dress in that fashion as well.

The film is trying to send a message, just not sure what message is, but it attempted.

Go watch, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man or Rocky if you need to feel inspired.",1119312000,6,1398,4.523809523809524

2259349,2,B0008FXSSS,"This movie would've been good had it not been so racist. It's racist towards white people and gives Native Americans a bad name with tons of stereotyped cliches. Eddie Spears couldn't play dead. His character can be summed up as a typical drunken indian who hates whites, listens to rap music, & dresses like a cowboy, all the while trying to pass as spiritual and traditional. I thought him dancing like a fool after burying his dead grandfather in the desert was a face palm worthy moment that was not only embarrassing, but I'm sure you would've heard laughter and/or groans of resentment if you would've caught this in a theater! The only good part was when BlackCloud gets the s*** kicked out of him and drowned in a toilet. Sadly he lives but the good thing is the guys who did it got away with it and the sheriff let them get away with it since he beat his nephew down earlier in the film. Trust me he deserved it!

2259370,5,B0008FXSSS,"When I read customer reviews about this film, I had mixed feelings about whether I should take the time to even watch it. So when I made up my mind to order it, I had to rent it to see if I'd made the right choice. I'm glad I did, because this film touched me.
Here's this young twenty-something year old Black Cloud who is trying to live a good life. He's a up and coming boxer who has this great girl and tries to make a honest and meaningful perspective on his life. Then he finds out that his veins flow the blood of white men who, from his point view, are the bain of existence because of what his people have suffered under the white man's reign. That's where self-destruction takes Black Cloud on an emotional rollercoaster, and he begins to make decisions that he'll eventually regret.
Losing himself in what he has learned to be his doomed heritage, Black Cloud turns his back on everything that he once stood for. He quits boxing, breaks up with the love of his life, Sammie, and hangs with the crowd that were once losers in his eyes.
With a drunk for a father, and noone else to turn to, he finally seeks advice about his mixed blood heritage from his grandfather who spiritually and emotionally guides him to the truth.
As Black Cloud comes to terms with who he really is and accepts it, he begins to slowly pull his life back together.
It definitelely wasn't what I expected. This film is much more to the eye when really studied. You'd definitely have to watch it more than once to get where its coming from. For a film that had a budget of just under a million dollars, I thought it was brilliant. The cinematography just made me want to be in the film myself. It was capturing and cast a new light on Native American acting.
Good job, Mr. Schroeder!
P.S. I'm hoping there will be a Black Cloud 2. I would like to know more about how Black Cloud copes with obstacles in the boxing world and what effects it may have on his relationship with Sammie. And they never really said if Jimmy died or not, only that he was touch and go (didn't look like he was going to make it).
Eddie Spears is an actor who brings grave emotion to his character and can't wait to see more of his work.",1196208000,3,2194,4.2764423076923075
2259371,5,B0008FXSSS,"This story was well played by a stellar Native American cast.

2259372,3,B0008FXSSS,"I like Eddie Spears, so I really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, he played a character almost identical to that of Shane in Dreamkeeper (2003).

Actually, Black Cloud shares several plot lines with Dreamkeeper: the absence of a positive father figure in the young man's life; a girlfriend whose father isn't too pleased that his daughter is hanging out with Shane/Black Cloud; the wise grandfather who dies in his sleep when his grandson finally gets the message what it means to be an American Indian; the young man (sort of) coming to terms with his father before riding off on a horse.

Rick Schroeder hinted at many, if not most of the problems on Indian reservations. However, this movie would have been better if he had chosen one main theme, explored it more and developed the relationships between the characters better.

I just hope Eddie Spears won't remain stuck in the role of ""angry young Indian""!",1186963200,,920,4.8471337579617835
2259373,3,B0008FXSSS,"Who would've thought that Rick Shroder from ""Silver Spoons"" would come out with a film of his own? That deserves a lot of credit. He's all grown up now! And to boot, he stars a little in his own film. You take boxing, a troubled Navajo Indian with a chip on his shoulder, and ""Black Cloud"" is what this is all about. With Tim McGraw added to the cast, it really isn't half-bad. The boxing action was decent. But to me it was rather predictable.

You have Black Cloud, a great boxer who is given a chance to try out for the Olympic Boxing Team. But Black Cloud is just that, and he has the inner demons to prove it. His insecurity is something that rings a bell early on. And along with the demons come adversity. Black Cloud faces it, and at times he gets into trouble. But along with his troubled soul, he has great potential. The question is, will he persevere? Will he be the warrior he knows he can be? Responsibility is to be taken, and somebody has to step up at some point.

Some might want to refer to this as, ""The American Indian Rocky!"" Come on! You might have the same results, granted. And while this is good, it is overly predictable. Being directed by Rick Shroder, talk about your silver spoons! The ending wasn't that original, and it was indeed too perfect. My wife and I looked at each other at one point during a certain fight. Then we said, ""If his eyes rolled back like that in a professional fight, let alone an amateur fight, that fight would be stopped!"" We had a good laugh at that one. But it was a good show. Not altogether a throw away. If it is possible for Rick Shroder to take that SILVER SPOON out of his mouth, he might make some great films one day. Good luck, little boy!",1185321600,,1707,4.24923076923077

I was surprised to learn that Ricky Schroder, wrote, directed and produced this movie, per the back of my box. You will not be disappointed if you like family clean movies. There is a couple of fight seens that you may want to check out before letting the little ones watch with you. Other than that, I only have good, good things to say.",1174435200,,484,4.329670329670329
2259375,4,B0008FXSSS,"This is by no means a great film, but it is certainly better than many reviewers here give it credit for.  Schroeder is to be commended for his efforts.  The low budget is evident throughout, but the acting is solid and the message an important one.  Even if it is a bit overwrought, one of the greatest issues for American Indians today is struggling with their identity and where they fit in this world.  What some may see here as melodramatic racism is actually a very real stigma that many ""mixed-bloods"" have to face.  In the end, this facet of the film makes it an important one, and a decent addition to the woefully inadequate genre of Native American film.

Eddie Spears is excellent - I hope to see him get more work.  If only Indians could get roles in films where their ethnicity was not the primary character.",1165795200,,822,4.476510067114094
2259376,2,B0008FXSSS,"Ricky Schroeder must be a terrific poker player.  It seems that everyone in this movie must have lost a bet to him.  I can't think of any reason why anyone would want to be in this stinker of a movie.

 Touted as a Native American ""Rocky"", Black Cloud feels more like a psychedelic mish-mash of ""The Power of One,"" ""Smoke Signals,"" ""When the Legends Die,"" and ""Eight Seconds.""  Eddie Spears plays Black Cloud, an up and coming Navajo boxer (this movie is often rented by swooning women who notice his bulky boxing build on the cover).  But he's tortured.  His mommy's dead, his father's a raging alcoholic and his girlfriend has a child with an Indian-hating bronco rider.  He doesn't trust whitey, rides horses in slo-mo and can't decide if he should try out for the Olympic Boxing Team or become another drunken Indian.

 All this confusion trickles down through the movie.  Every fifteen minutes, we hear a different genre of music.  We go from psuedo-flute music ala ""Dances With Wolves,"" to Country, Rock & Roll, Rap, Classical and I think some Techno thrown in.  All we need now is some Zydeco, Buddhist Chants and Japanese Taiko drums.

 This cinematic hopscotching can be blamed on Ricky Schroeder.  Name sound familiar?  He's the `Silver Spoons' kid; you know, that 80's sitcom.  He wrote, acted in and directed Black Cloud.  Granted, some shots are cool, but he doesn't understand how to use action slo-mo like John Woo (Face Off) or Robert Rodriguez (Desperado) or tell a story like them.  Not many get a chance to write and direct movies; this excitement must have inspired him to write an epic tale of the hardships facing Native American men who box.  Though he writes with a sympathetic hand toward the plight and conflict of Native Americans in a modern world, he can't help but load the movie with stereotypes: evil cowboys, corrupt Indian agents, mouthy gangsta's, a lone sympathetic white man, animal spirits and the ever present issue with alcohol.  The only Julia Jones, who plays Black Cloud's honey-mutton, escapes stereotyping and is woefully underused.  As for Eddie Spears, he still stuck in his ""Dreamkeeper"" persona and more often than not you want to slap him and tell him to snap out of it.  Peter Green surprisingly plays a straight man in this movie and also under used.  And Tim McGraw?  Like his music, his acting is wooden, forced and drab.  Stick him in a corner, toss a war bonnet on his head and give him a can of cigars and he'd have provided the irony in this flick.  I do note, however, his character as the sheriff is hard to pin down.  Is he a good guy or bad guy?  At the end of the movie, no one was sure; call it good or bad writing, I liked that bit of duality.

 The mere fact this 'Phantoms' quality movie went nearly straight to video tells you many things about the acting, directing, story-telling, cinematography and the like.  'Smoke Signals', while not achieving its full potential, garnered praise for acting and directing. 'Black Cloud' had enough fine actors, but the writing kept them from doing their jobs well. Case in point: Wayne Knight. His sliminess could have been pulled off better, but his cartoon jerk-ness robbed the scene of drama and added little to this cinematic travesty. Like 'Phantoms', 'Black Cloud' had the cast, but not the writing, direction or heart of other movies like 'Clearcut', 'Medicine River' or, sad to say, 'The Darkwind.'

 To me, there are too many Native American-themed movies that rely heavily on the wrongs inflicted by the white man.  It gets tiring and boring.  Even ""Smoke Signals"" couldn't disgorge the tortured Indian motif and if anyone says that Steven Segal did Indians justice, I've got a cement block and a boat ride that'll alleviate their troubles.  Ricky Schoeder's heart went out to the Navajo, but he ought to have kept it tucked safely between his lungs.  Black Cloud is a ninety-seven minute noble attempt, but that's all that it is.  I don't recommend this movie lest you wish to learn what not to do in a Native American moving picture show.

 And what ever you do, don't play cards with Ricky Schoeder.",1163808000,2,4119,4.719495091164095

In fact, I probably wouldn't have watched the movie if it weren't for him.  I don't think he's getting near the credit he deserves for his contribution to the movie, but that's just me. All in all, it's a good movie, and I feel that it gives an accuarate portrayal of modern life of young American Indians on the Rez today, simply because Russell Means, being who he is, would not have been a part of it if it didn't, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Mr. Means.",1147392000,5,540,4.133333333333334

  ""Black Cloud(2005)"" is about the personal struggles and triumphs of Navajo boxer Black Cloud. (Full name) Black Cloud (Eddie Spears) faces racism from the local residents and city police near the Navajo rez. Local Sheriff Powers (McGraw) knows about the personal struggles of the Navajo Nation people. And he sees Black Cloud as a survivor, so he gives Black Cloud the benefit of the doubt when he gets in trouble. The only outlet Black Cloud has is boxing. Boxing keeps Black Cloud out of trouble when it is so easy to find on the rez. When an Olympic scout (Peter Greene) sees Black Cloud fight on the boxing under-card of an arrogant Olympic hopeful Rocket Ray Tracey (Pooch Hall), he sees Black Cloud making the Olympic boxing team. But will Black Cloud's personal demons get the best of him? Black Cloud's father is an alcoholic. He has constant parties at his house and has no time for his son. So, Black Cloud seeks out his coach and mentor, Bud. (Russell Means)

  Black Cloud's girlfriend Sammi (Julia Jones) has a son by rodeo circuit, white bull rider Eddie. (Schroder) When Eddie tries to reunite with his ex, Sammie, Black Cloud's anger gets the best of him and he opens a can of whip ass on Eddie. Will this put an end to his Olympic shot?

  The character relationship and dialogue could have been developed more. The background, relationships and why Black Cloud does not trust the white man were not explained thoroughly. A lot of the stereotypical Native association is utilized like alcoholism, trust, mysticism and poverty. But this is the first time I've seen Native Hip Hop in a film. The typical hard partying and attitude came along with it. Native Hip Hop has been actually infiltrating and influencing the younger generation on the rez for many years. Whether that is good or bad can still be debated.

  The film shows the beauty of the Navajo Nation rez located at the four corners. Rick Schroder utilizes boxing coach Jimmy Gambin (Rocky, The Champ) to train the boxers. The boxing elements in the film are action packed and realistic.

  Recognizable Native actors include; Nathaniel Arcand (Jimmy), Saginaw Grant (Grandpa) and Branscombe Richmond (Peter). ""Seinfeld's"" Wayne Knight makes a special appearance as the special favor, white power monger Mr. Tipping.

  Rick Schroder (Little Ricky in Silver Spoons) utilizes his experiences from acting and growing up in the entertainment industry to help with filming. The DVD shows his potential as a director, but his script writing on this film could have been more polished. Will the financial risk of movie making leave Schroder high and dry in the future?",1128643200,10,2821,4.878406708595388
2259382,3,B0008FXSSS,"I'm a big fan of Rick Schroder's acting in such programs as ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""NYPD Blue,"" so I really wanted to like ""Black Cloud,"" his debut as a director/screenwriter, a lot more than I did. The film's not terrible, but it is something of a disappointment. To begin with, Schroder did himself no favors by making a boxing movie at the same time that two other actors-turned-directors, Clint Eastwood and Ron Howard, released veritable masterpieces of that genre. And then, though Schroder the director shows confidence and visual flair, Schroder the screenwriter doesn't seem quite sure of the story he wants to tell. Does he want a rousing boxing flick in which the underdog triumphs a' la ""Rocky,"" or a searing indictment of the racism and dead-end prospects young Native Americans face? Frankly, I found the second story by far the more effective of the two, particularly as acted by Eddie Spears as the titular character, a young Navajo boxer consumed by frustration and hatred of the white man's world. (His hatred, at least in the context of the movie, is thoroughly justified; every major white character except one in this movie is an irredeemable monster.) When he sticks to Black Cloud and his plight, Schroder works strongly and sharply, and he elicits excellent performances not only from Spears as Black Cloud, but also from Julia Jones as Black Cloud's girlfriend Sammi and Nathaniel Arcand as his best pal Jimmy. (Schroder also contributes a sharp performance as Eddie, Sammi's vindictive ex-boyfriend and the father of her child.) But these scenes never really mesh with the boxing portions of the movie, so that the entire film in the end seems soft and diffuse. Schroder's directing of his actors is uneven; Russell Means is a little shaky as Black Cloud's boxing coach, and Tim McGraw is downright bad as the bigoted local sheriff. Also, Schroder makes the mistake of segueing into Navajo mysticism, which produces some embarrassingly awkward screen moments, particularly toward the end. ""Black Cloud"" is good enough to make me hope that Schroder will do better with his second effort, but not quite good enough for me to recommend.",1127865600,11,2156,4.991666666666666
