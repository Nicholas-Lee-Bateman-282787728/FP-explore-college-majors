3098795,5,B0012U9VI4,"This comedy is definitely a ""Loren vehicle"". The camera does not neglect ANY of her unbelievable features, with plenty of close-ups, and her equally unbelievable figure clad in the most provocative regal costumes. The difference between the Loren-Cleopatra (seductive femme-fatale) and the sweet, scared blond girl she plays is striking, and she appears in both roles on the same frame.

I'm a Loren fan and I had to have this early performance of hers dripping sensuality. She would have made a much more impressive Cleopatra than Elizabeth Taylor.",1175299200,15,549,5.238636363636363

8247818,4,B0012U9VI4,"Love this movie . Its a good laugh and nice to see sophia when she was really young, wow!!!!!!!  Entertaining, kinda like the prince and the pauper and other movies like it. She always steals the show with her presence.  Paul",1438560000,,225,4.463414634146342
8247819,3,B0012U9VI4,"This version has great picture quality, but all the nud scenes of Sophia are edited out, i have seen this movie with the nude scenes included, but lesser picture quality. Too bad the Koreans edited this film, it could have been a collectors item.",1437264000,,246,4.613636363636363
8247820,5,B0012U9VI4,"Very good example of the humor of some of Sophia Loren's movies. Plus, she (as usual) is amazingly good looking.",1397779200,,112,4.65
8247821,1,B0012U9VI4,"I guess I got what I deserved. I bought this glunk, knowing I wouldn't like it, but I thought it was worth $14 to see Sophia in the altogether. Phooey!",1391990400,,151,4.066666666666666
8247822,4,B0012U9VI4,"This Korean import is an excellent restoration (both sound and video) of this mildly amusing 1953 Italian sex farce. The only jarring note is that the artwork on the DVD is taken from the 1934 Claudette Colbert movie. Korean language subtitles can easily be turned off.

Potential buyers should avoid the non-Korean version of ""Two Nights With Cleopatra."" As noted by my review, that DVD is an unrestored mess.",1335916800,,410,4.942028985507246
8247823,4,B0012U9VI4,I purchased Korean version of this DVD. Outside DVD cover has Korean describtion of the movie. DVD is excellent quality. Perfectly restored copy with very bright colors. it looked amazing in my DVD player. I was very surprised how well it is restored. I recommend the restored Korean version. Audio is English. subtitles are in English and Korean can be turned of.,1330041600,6,364,4.887096774193548
8247824,5,B0012U9VI4,Item received in good time and was in good condition. Would deal with this person again,1270944000,,87,4.5
8247825,2,B0012U9VI4,"This is a mildly amusing Italian farce, best known today for the scene showing Sophia Loren taking a nude swim (this clip is all over the Internet).  However, the quality of this DVD is really disgraceful.  It has not been restored at all, so colors are badly faded and there is dirt everywhere.  Furthermore, the DVD is dubbed in English, rather than being available in Italian with English language subtitles.

Hopefully some day a properly restored DVD in Italian with subtitles will be available.",1226793600,7,500,4.916666666666667
