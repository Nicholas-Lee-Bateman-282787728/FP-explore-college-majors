8579917,5,B00CBKKWHI,"This is an almost forgotton gem about a chinese gangster in the so called limehouse area of London. George Raft is wonderful as always, and yes, it is a bit odd to see him cast as an oriental, but I think he pulls it off. His character is a gangster with a heart who falls in love with a white girl, a big taboo in its day. Give it a try.",1379289600,,338,3.7746478873239435
8579918,1,B00CBKKWHI,Not the best of George Raft.  Could not even watch all of the movie because did not find it interesting nor entertaining. Not a fan,1378857600,,131,4.24
