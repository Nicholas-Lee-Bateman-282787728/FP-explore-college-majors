8148170,3,B000IZJRLU,"""Pehchaan"" (recognition) as pictured here is the remake from the 1990's, and therefore the product information is in error.  This version stars brooding action hero Sunil Shetty and now superstar Saif Ali Khan, back when both were fairly new leading men, and the story is skewed toward them, rather than their prominent father (as played in the original with Vinod Khanna), in order to give them as much chance as possible to show off their good looks, fighting skills, and, in Saif's case, trendy clothes.

The basic story is pretty straighforward: a criminal blames his lawyer for his conviction, and takes an opportunity to get revenge by kidnapping the lawyer's wife. When she returns obviously pregnant, her husband rejects her, assuming she was raped by her captor.  The lawyer raises his two sons to consider their mother dead, while his prominence increases and he becomes a wealthy judge.  The motherless boys grow up and take different paths, with the eldest (Sunil Shetty) trying to please his father in every way, while the younger (Saif Ali Khan) plays the irresponsible bad boy.  Then one day he hears rumors of a teenaged girl who dances in tawdry clubs and may be the daughter of his mother, and his search for the truth of the past has a dramatic affect on the family.

The film is very typical of the early '90s, when producers were searching for a way to meld the hangover style of the 1980s with the progress of the new decade; the resulting messy masala movies were tepid affairs, enlivened only by the introduction of a brash new generation of actors which included the breakout ""King Khans,"" Shah Rukh, Aamir and Salman, as well as Akshaye Kumar, Ajay Devgan, Sunil Shetty and Saif Ali Khan. The production has all the hallmarks of the way Bollywood films were made before 1995, when Aditya Chopra's film ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" revolutionized the Hindi film industry and changed the way Indian movies were made. ""Pehchaan"" is not as fast-paced or Westernized as current Bollywood, and suffers by comparison, but for the viewer who is willing to put those considerations aside and look at the film as part of its time, there are some rewards to be had.  This film is also recommended for fans of both Saif and Sunil, showcasing their youth and charm before their later film personas were fully formed.",1313107200,,2330,4.824561403508772
