7905295,4,B000007W8U,music was delightful and retained it's original production quality. I would like to see others with the sound tracks listed on the product before buying.,1370995200,,153,5.16
7905296,5,B000007W8U,"This is another wonderful video by Helmut Lotti.  His vocal ranges are extradonary, his performance is magical.  I totally agree with the other review, so there is not much more that I can add, except start listening and buying Helmut Lotti.  Perhaps we can convience him to come to the USA for a concert!  I will be the first in line where ever it is! Don't miss his other album, Helmut Lotti Goes Classic, its even better if thats possible.  More exciting songs are displayed in that endeavor, this performance had a subtle gentleness because of the tender selections of the music he sings.  His love for his daughter and respect for humanity are evident in all his performances.  He really touches my heart.  Total enjoyment.  I highly suggest purchasing this video.",1082851200,3,769,4.765151515151516
7905297,4,B000007W8U,"Somewhere between the Lawrence Welk crowd and Andrea Bocelli's fans, are the many (mostly in Europe) that appreciate Helmut Lotti. Purists may dismiss him as ""schmaltzy"", but Helmut has a truly fabulous voice, with a huge range, and a magnificent timbre that for me, makes his voice irresistible. He started singing at an early age, and at 19, having listened to his idol Elvis Presley for many years, impersonated him under the pseudonym of  Kevin Leach. He does 2 songs in this concert in honor of his musical hero, and really captures the Elvis sound, with the velvety deep tones, but Helmut's voice is usually a tenor with a ringing vibrato, and he can really belt out the high notes.
Originally shown as a PBS special, this open air concert in Belgium's Cleydael Castle is interspersed with short interview clips which are in English, and there are subtitles for when he talks to the audience. There are 3 extra tracks on this tape, not seen in the TV performance. The Golden Symphonic Orchestra is ably conducted by Andr Walschaerts, and the setting is lovely, with water between the stage and the audience.
Born in Belgium, Helmut was 26 when this concert was taped in 1997, but looks like an adorable teenager, and oozes boyish charm.
Many of the songs are lyrics set to classical melodies, and the song list is:
""Comme Facette Mammeta""
""La Paloma""
""Amazing Grace"" (a la Elvis)
""Shalom Alechem"" (marvelous !)
""Gloire Immortelle"" (""The Soldier's Chorus"" from Gounod's ""Faust"")
""Tiny Hands, Tiny Feet"" (""Cradle Song"")
""Muss I Denn""
""Mother Nature"" (with Alice Libell)
""Back in Time"" ( to ""Dance of the Hours"")
""Das ist der Tag"" (""Waltz of the Skaters""...this is Helmut at his best !)
""My Love Will Never Die"" (which he wrote for his daughter)
""Why"" (from ""Swan Lake""...ends with a blazing high note !)
""John Brown's Body"" (""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" a la Evis again)
""Marinja""
""Der Lindenbaum""
""Stenka Rasin"" (in Russian)
""The Stars""
This is a well produced concert, and though it may be ""schmaltzy"", it is also fun, and if you appreciate wonderful voices, Helmut is a treat to listen to. Total time is 74 minutes.",1064966400,6,2123,4.816438356164384
