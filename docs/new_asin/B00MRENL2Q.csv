Just like the Volume I video of this series, watching it is very much like getting a personal briefing from a close, knowledgeable friend with lots of details and pictures to give you an accurate view.  We learned of many places to go and things to do that we would never have known about without this video.  We were also able to set our expectations appropriately for the sailing conditions and distances we would cover.

This DVD is well thought out and complete for the avid or timid adventurer.  It takes a lot of the fear out of the process for one of us on the Molly J team.

An anchorage for every mood was right on!  Numerous tips and recommendations provided concerning passage making, anchorages, provisioning, dinning out, snorkeling, day trips and local contacts. The photography both above and underwater is fantastic! I found the information concerning customs and immigration when leaving Chiapas Marina very helpful as well as the details concerning taxis in the area.
