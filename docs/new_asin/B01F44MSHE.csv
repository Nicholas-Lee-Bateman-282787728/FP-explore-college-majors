7743056,5,B01F44MSHE,"Tyrone Power made his most indelible mark with his performance of Zorro, the legendary hero of old California.

Directed by Russian-born Rouben Mamoulian, also known for the 1931 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and the stylish Silk Stockings (1957), last of the great MGM musicals starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, The Mark of Zorro has a distinctive dramatic flair. Utilizing the chiaroscuro talents of cinematographer Arthur Miller  a master of light and shadow in black-and-white film  he gives the adventure a distinctive film noir look.
Zorros story has been made into film again and again by the likes of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who established the role, Antonio Banderas, and Guy Williams on 1950s TV. Often compared to Robin Hood, notably immortalized by Errol Flynn in 1938, and The Scarlet Pimpernel, 1934, with a perfect Leslie Howard, hes got more in common with todays Dark Knight  the Batman himself.

Batmans creator, Bob Kane, credits the masked avenger as his inspiration. Zorro cloaks himself in black  mask and cape included. His trademark signal is a Z sliced into fabric, stone, wood, etc., a sign that evil-doers better beware, while giving hope to the oppressed. Theres no Batmobile; Zorro rides a high-spirited black horse. He also has an over-educated alter ego, Don Diego de Vega, son of the local alcade, a wealthy, law abiding magistrate. Like Batman, Diego disguises himself as an ultra-sophisticate.

And he has an arch villain  Captain Esteban Pasquale played with daredevil panache by Basil Rathbone. Both Power and Rathbone demonstrate their skill at swordplay before they face off in a dynamic finale. Rapier slim and starkly handsome, long shots showcase their near-balletic expertise. Again, Miller uses shadow against stark white and deep blacks to increase dramatic effect.

Yes, Kino Lorber has once more provided a fine 1080p transfer from the Fox vault. It surpasses broadcast and earlier home-viewing presentations with solid blacks and gray scale complemented by bright, white highlights. A Spanish dance between Power and Linda Darnell, the beauty portraying the Diego/Zorro love interest, is a literal shining example. Both have so many sequins on their costumes, the effect is like watching a light show.

Audio via DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 delivers clear, well-balanced sound in a good blend of dialogue, effects (gunfire, galloping steeds, steel-on-steel) with a terrific Alfred Newman score. The only thing missing is a subtitle option  necessary for keeping housemates undisturbed and combating our own outside special effects without taking down the neighborhood.

The plot is simple. An accomplished military graduate, Don Diego returns home to Los Angeles of the 1800s to find his father replaced by a corrupt government regime. With the army as enforcement, the newcomers are intent on taxing every peso they can get from the village farmers, with the occasional beating thrown in for fun. So the locals are overjoyed when Zorro appears to toss them a curve ball or three, seizing their riches  with interest  and returning it to those who are most in need. The gold is then doled out by the local church, in this case headed up by Fray Felipe, played by Eugene Pallette of the deep, rasping voice. Pallete also played the definitive Friar Tuck in The Adventures of Robin Hood. In his own way, like Power, hes an unmistakable presence blending comedy with 1930-40s badassery.

The Blu-ray disc has two good extras ported from the initial DVD release. Tyrone Power: The Last Idol documentary, an episode from A&Es early Biography series, has interviews with two of Powers wives, his daughter, and acting friends Alice Faye, Roddy McDowell and Piper Laurie. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Power came from an acting family, who hit upon hard times in the 20s. Following the stage, his father disappeared when Tyrone was young. The two caught up together later and formed a deep bond. Power senior guided his sons early acting career offering seasoned advice.

Tyrone became best known for costumed dramas like Lloyds of London, In Old Chicago, Captain from Castile and my personal favorite, Prince of Foxes. Im sad to learn he didn't much care for Foxes, a film set in the Italian Renaissance which also featured Orson Welles and Everett Sloane. Made after WWII, he looked older, wearier and ably conveyed a more mature, somewhat bitter character.

His personal favorites included more contemporary dramas such as Witness for the Prosecution, directed by Billy Wilder and co-starring Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. There he played against type as a man on trial for murder. Its also available from Kino Lorber; theres a trailer on Zorros disc, as well as for the 1951 Western, Rawhide. Power also starred in the 1947 film noir, Nightmare Alley.
Despite a lucrative film career, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps soon after the outbreak of WWII as an experienced pilot. Too old to fly in combat, his missions concentrated on transporting supplies and the wounded.

The other big extra is a so-so commentary by film critic and author Richard Schickel. He delivers smart anecdotes and scene-specific technical observations between long, drawn out pauses. Still, he is mostly caught up in Powers bisexuality and Don Diegos fop persona without any seeming background on its history.

A fop was a derogatory term for a man obsessed with appearance and style coined in the 1700s. Skilled in fashion, swordplay and vocabulary, the fop became a generally comic, sometimes menacing icon of plays, books and film  but not necessarily homosexual. He was perfectly depicted by Tim Roth as the arrogant Cunningham in Rob Roy (1995). George Sanders made a career of him  off screen and on  in All About Eve, Rebecca and The Picture of Dorian Gray.

The most recent example is Johnny Depps stylin pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow  a character that gave execs at Disney a heart-stopping turn when shown the first dailies. (Its pronounced e-gre-gious!) The Scarlet Pimpernels Sir Percy Blakeney hid behind the fop during his life-saving exploits in the French Revolution. Christian Bale brought out the self-centered playboy/dandy disguise of Bruce Wayne in Chris Nolans Batman trilogy.

Looks like Tyrone Powers Don Diego, the mask of his hero, is in good company. And you will be, too, with The Mark of Zorro. Dont miss it.

7743058,1,B01F44MSHE,"This review concerns the quality of the picture in this Blu-ray version of The Mark of Zorro. Just to make it clear, I love this film but this Blu-ray transfer stinks. They should be ashamed. I would not waste my money on this version of the film. It's clear that these companies just don't care about these older films, there just isn't enough money in it. I have been watching The Mark of Zorro streaming on Amazon in HD and it is far superior to this piece of crap. If you already have this on dvd don't waste your cash (the extras are the same) I'm tired of being insulted by these companies.",1470096000,4,596,4.283185840707965

7743060,1,B01F44MSHE,I love this movie. It is great entertainment. I should have read the one star reviews before buying this Blu-ray version. I already have the DVD version and thought the Blu-ray would be an improved quality.  I was wrong.  The DVD is better. The picture quality is just as good as the Blu-ray. It has more special features and it has subtitles which the Blu-ray does not. I am very disappointed and I feel I wasted my money on this Blu-ray..,1487635200,5,440,4.419753086419753

7743063,1,B01F44MSHE,"It's a shame that the colour version wasn't made available on the blu-ray as well, there should have been a choice of both. Contrary to what many people think I believe that in the not to distant future without colourisation of B&W films that they will be forgotten about by the mainstream, colour can add a life and dimension to a film. It is unbelievable how many critics had nothing to say of George Lucas Star Wars changes with CGI, but then criticize B&W colourisation.",1483056000,,474,4.588235294117647

7743065,5,B01F44MSHE,"Don Diego de Vega (Tyrone Power) leaves the comforts of 19th century Spain to return to his parents in Los Angeles, California. His father was mayor but has been replaced by a new and corrupt alcalde who is the puppet of Captain Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). Diego soon discovers how oppressed the regular people are. He maintains a foppish, spoiled persona by day, but at night he maraudes as Zorro. He robs from the alcalde to give back to the poor. Zorro enlists the aide of the local padre, Fray Filipe, to redistribute the wealth. Diego falls for the alcalde's beautiful niece (Linda Darnell), who is more interested in the heroic Zorro than the popinjay Diego. So the plot and main character is a combination of The Scarlet Pimpernel and Robin Hood moved to 19th century California.

What could have been a run-of-the-mill, derivative action film turns out to be a highly entertaining and action packed movie. Tyrone Power makes a great, athletic hero and is also perfect as the spoiled aristocrat. Rathbone is an excellent villain (even better than his performance in Robin Hood). Their sword fights are exciting and impressive. The stunt work is also amazing. Diego's schemes to return his father to control are fun and logical, and he plays every angle he can to convince the alcalde to go back to Spain. He manipulates the alcalde and his wife in different ways to great effect, while he also woes their niece. All the while Diego keeps his parents in the dark, causing a bit of household strife. The big battle at the end is exciting and satisfying.

I'm surprised this film is not more popular. It's just as exciting as Errol Flynn's Adventures of Robin Hood (maybe more so) and is much more substantive. My son saw about one minute of this film on TV while we were in a hotel and loved it (we had to switch because it was my daughter's turn to pick what to watch). Happily our local library had it on DVD but we will probably get our own copy of this wonderful action film.

A fun bit of trivia--Eugene Pallette played Friar Tuck in the Errol Flynn film and plays basically the same role, albeit as Fray Filipe, in this film. Filipe is a more substantial character, so this film has the better performance.",1480982400,,2216,4.633587786259542

7743068,3,B01F44MSHE,"Standard Zorro fare with the masked bandit stealing from the authorities. Of course, a young girl falls in love with the mysterious desperado. This version of the Zorro story is of mild interest with not enough action until the last fourth of the movie, when there is more action and a higher level of interest. If you enjoy adventure movies of the 30s and 40s, you will like this film. I prefer the 1998 Mask of Zorro with Banderas and Zeta-Jones.",1476662400,,448,4.54320987654321

8760037,4,B01F44MSHE,This DVD version by a specialty operation Kino is far far superior to the botched release in DVD by the studio. Latter was poorer than the VHS version in picture defects and a poor transfer.  The movie is black and white adventure at its best.  The movie script is taut and there is no wasted frames.  It just zips along and every one of the studio actors are at top of their form.  The music is great Newman and Friedhofer.  Narration by Shickel adds nothing to the picture but I suppose we have to expect a narration tract.  No information and little there.  But this is a good action picture and well worth having in Blu Ray.  I do wish the company would have included at least a two page booklet of the film and its generation of Zorros in filmic lore.  It deserved such.,1519948800,,775,4.289655172413793
