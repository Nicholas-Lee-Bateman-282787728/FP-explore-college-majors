3010816,5,B000Y11BC6,"Jackie Chan is one of my favorite actors - I absolutely adore the outtakes and I always wince a little depending on what he's doing since he does the majority of his own stunts.  Or at least he did.

Are these two great movies?  No.  Are they funny with some action thrown in and entertaining?  YES!

3010859,5,B000Y11BC6,"I have been a western fan all of my life, and I hate it when movie maker make fun of the genre. But these two are so well done and funny, they are the exception to my rule. Jackie is  funny and a brilliant martial arts expert/stunt man, and Owen Wilson was never more perfect for a wannabe western bad man/American hipster. There are many action packed hilarious scenes throughout both films with Roy (not Roger) Owen Wilson and Jackie (John Wayne) Chan, lousy name for a western hero. Some fun points in Shanghai Knights that tickled me were the fact that they were helped in London by and inspector Doyle, Artie to be exact, and the bad guy is Lord Rathbone. An actor named Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes in many film. Also notice the pop music hits that back up that punctuates the film. I think both will keep your attention and laughing through the movies.",1455062400,,862,4.490445859872612

3010937,5,B000Y11BC6,"I like both these movies so when I fond I could get them as a twin-pak, I immediately ordered the pair.

SHANGHAI NOON:  This is a fun movie full of Jackie Chan feats  to delight the eye and boggle the mind.  Owen Wilson is great as the totally inept braggart of a bankrobber who is basically good at heart, and the two make a great enough team to film a sequel to this story.  There are cliches galore, little in-jokes about Westerns, etc., through the characters names, snarky remarks, and even posters on the sides of barns. It's fast-paced and funny, with plenty of recognizable faces who've since become more recognizable in TV series.

SHANGHAI KNIGHTS: With the music to ""England Swings like a Pendulum Do' in the background the two hapless heroes arrive in London and are immediately thrown into havoc and mayhem as they meet a young Scotland Yard man named Arthur Conan Doyle who's attempting to use a new method of ratiocination to solve crimes.  The puns fly thickly in words as well as in the background music. The fight scenes are as energetic and fantastic as expected.  It's ridiculous, sarcastic, and tongue-in-cheek with a few risque moments here and there.

These are two fun movies and I recommend them.",1433203200,,1222,4.699530516431925

The result is entertainment that makes you laugh, touches your heart, and makes you wonder how they can do the amazing stunts. Owen Wilson contributes his own unique kind of humor that adds another dimension to the antics onscreen.

3011021,4,B000Y11BC6,"With the success of ""Rush Hour"" in 1998, more films to showcase martial arts movie star Jackie Chan continued well into the 2000s and this time around, pairing him with actor Owen Wilson in the martial arts action comedy western film titled ""Shanghai Noon"".

Earning over $99 million in the box office, the film featured the filmmaking debut of Tom Dey (""Showtime"", ""Failure to Launch"") and feature a screenplay written by writing duo Miles Millar and Alfred Gough (""Spider-Man 2, ""I Am Number Four"", ""Smallville"").

The film featured an all-star cast with Jackie Chan (""Rush Hour"" films, ""The Karate Kid"", ""Shinjuku Incident""), Owen Wilson (""Midnight in Paris"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Cars"" films), Lucy Liu (""Kill Bill: Vol. 1, ""Lucky Number Slevin"", ""Charlie's Angels""), Roger Yuan (""Batman Begins"", ""Skyfall"", ""Syriana"") and Xander Berkeley (""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", ""Air Force One"", ""Gattaca"", ""Taken"").

With the success of ""Shanghai Noon"" in the box office, it would guarantee a sequel in 2003 titled ""Shanghai Knights"" but this time directed by David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Fred Claus"", ""The Change-Up"").  But bringing back both writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.

VIDEO:

""Shanghai Noon/Shanghai Knights: 2-Movie Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Having owned both DVD's, picture quality for both films look amazing on Blu-ray!  Colors are much more vibrant, the film doesn't look like it's nearly 14-years-old.  Colors are vibrant and sharp outdoors, black levels are nice and deep.  If anything, both films definitely looks much better in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Shanghai Knights"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital (note: Spanish is 5.1 on ""Shanghai Noon"" and 2.0 on ""Shanghai Knights"").  I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that the films did not receive a DTS-HD Master Audio conversion as most films from Buena Vista or Touchstone Home Entertainment receive a lossless audio conversion.  With that being said, both films had active surround Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks when they were released on DVD.  As can be said with the soundtrack on Blu-ray!  Good use of surround channels for the action sequences and LFE, while the second film tend to utilize the music soundtrack a bit more with its modern music.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It was a chance to see a different side of Jackie Chan, combining martial arts, action and western?  Who would of thought that this concept would work?  But in 2000, people came out to see Jackie Chan, the legendary martial arts actor who has been in movies since the 1960s.

While many Americans saw Jackie Chan in the popular 1981 film ""The Cannonball Run"", while martial arts fans were treated with fantastic Jackie Chan films through the '80s such as the ""Police Story"" films, ""Supercop"" films and ""The Legend of Drunken Master"", many had to import these films or watch them at a film festival.

Until 1995 and many had the opportunity to see Jackie Chan in a film that was dubbed but tailored to Western tastes with ""Rumble in the Bronx"".  This led to past films he made, being dubbed in English and being released in theaters or direct-to-video and by 1997, he was making films such as ""Mr. Nice Guy"" and ""Who Am I?"".

But it's the police comedy ""Rush Hour"", where people had a chance to see a film directed by an American and combining Jackie Chan's martial arts skills with comedy, playing opposite to an American talent.  ""Rush Hour"" was a box office success and would spawn two more films, writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar would create an action western but utilizing another American collaboration with Jackie Chan but with Owen Wilson, who was not the big star as he would later become, as the only major films he had appeared in were ""The Haunting"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Anaconda"".  Suffice to say, ""Shanghai Noon"" would continue showcasing Jackie Chan as the legendary martial arts actor on the big screen, while Owen Wilson would show that he can do comedy films and be a headliner.

The film would also allow Jackie Chan to incorporate his Hong Kong fight choreography using his crew, but also working with an American crew to have an East meets West type of production, but to also showcase Jackie Chan's Buster Keaton physical comedy-style that he has been known for.

""Shanghai Noon"" would go on to make over $99 million and in 2003, it sequel ""Shanghai Knights"" would go on to make over $88 million.

It has probably been a decade or more since I have watched each of these films.  At the time, I was still on a Jackie Chan high, and really wanting to watch every film that he has starred in.  One thing that we know about Jackie Chan is that he is an actor that is so dedicated, but also willing to sacrifice his body in order to make these films.  He makes it look easy, when you know, he's probably been hurt countless times while shooting the film.

My thoughts on ""Shanghai Noon"" was that the film gave Jackie Chan a chance to show that collaborations between an Eastern fight staff and a Western staff can be done and how important fight scenes are in getting the timing right.  That is the experience that Jackie Chan brings to a film.

While ""Rush Hour"" plays on the racial card for a lot of its humor, ""Shanghai Noon"" is more or less about two guys who were not that great at what they do.  Jackie Chan was not a good Imperial Guard and Owen Wilson was not a good Outlaw.  But these two found a way to work with each other and take on significant odds.  It's a classic story of underdogs managing to get the job done!

""Shanghai Noon"" also starred Lucy Liu who was best known during the '90s and early 2000s for ""Ally McBeal"" but 2000 would prove to be a banner year for Liu who would star in both ""Shanghai Noon"" and as one of the angels in ""Charlie's Angels"".

But the film was fun and a pure popcorn action film with two unlikely talents to be put together in a film and it worked!

As for ""Shanghai Knights"", the film tries to bank on new director David Dobkin (who would later direct comedy films ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Fred Claus"" and ""The Change-Up"").  When I watched this in the theater back in 2003, there were a few things that bothered me about the film.

For one, how would they address the women that were part of the lives of Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon from the first film, how would they utilize one of the most well-known martial arts actors from Hong Kong with Donnie Yen and how would the story be with the characters leaving America and going straight to London.

While bringing the story to London would allow for great play of names such as Charlie Chaplin and Artie Doyle (or Arthur Conan Doyle), it's one thing to have fun with that.  But the problem was that the writers tried to take what made the first film enjoyable but taking them out of the western environment and bringing them London.  It just didn't seem right, nor did the character of Rathbone in the beginning, killing Wong's father.  The character didn't seem ominous, he looked too much like singer, Josh Groban.

And while Jackie Chan was able to deliver in action as expected, the story also suffers from third wheel problems, by giving too much time for Chon Lin.  While it's great for the film to showcase Fann Wong in action scenes, I often wondered if they knew how awesome of an actor  Donnie Yen was.  This could have led to one of the greatest matchups in an American martial arts film (ie. think Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li), but instead, they gave more screentime to the character of Rathbone and it just didn't seem right. The battle between Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen's characters just fell flat and how it ends was just terrible.  The utilization of supporting characters and antagonists didn't seem right and while the film was OK, ""Shanghai Noon"" was so much better!

As for the Blu-ray release, having owned both DVD's of the films, both films definitely look so much better in High Definition, but I was surprised both did not receive the lossless treatment.  Both are Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS-HD MA 5.1 and I found that to be surprising.  But both had wonderful soundtracks when they were released on DVD years ago and still sounds active through the surround channels and a bit of LFE utilized as well for this Blu-ray release.  Both films are featured on one Blu-ray disc.  You also get all the DVD special features content included with this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Shanghai Noon/Shanghai Knights: 2- Movie Collection"" are entertaining as popcorn action comedy films.  These films are definitely not the best Jackie Chan films, nor his worst.  But I found these films much more easier to stomach without the racial comedy as seen in the ""Rush Hour"" films.

""Shanghai Noon"" was a much better film than it sequel ""Shanghai Knights"" and while I don't see a third film ever being released (especially with Jackie Chan's comments on America and his previous American films made earlier this year), the release of both films back in the early 2000s was about interest in both talents, good timing and the timing was just right as people wanted to see more of Jackie Chan, the martial arts action star and Owen Wilson, the up-and-coming star.

For those who enjoy this film, while it doesn't have the lossless soundtrack, it's definitely worth upgrading for the picture quality and I do recommend this ""Shanghai Noon/Shanghai Knights: 2- Movie Collection"" for fans of the two films or are fans of  Jackie Chan or Owen Wilson.",1372896000,5,11564,4.85145482388974

3011038,5,B000Y11BC6,"""Shanghai Noon"" has long been one of my favorite American Jackie Chan films, featuring not only classic Chan combats but also a partnership with a non-Asian actor that is lively and enlightening instead of depressing and demeaning;  it was directed by a JC fan who was invested in presenting the Hong Kong Jackie persona that the world loves in a more Hollywood format that American audiences were comfortable with, and Tom Dey absolutely got it right.

With a witty ""fish out of water"" story that pays homage to the great Westerns (from glossing ""High Noon"" to naming Chan  a Chinese sound-alike for John Wayne) while playing havoc with the genre's conventions, and a great cast from both East and West (supporting standouts include HK martial arts actor Yu Rong-guan using an array of Chinese weaponry, American Roger Yuan playing an Imperial villain, and Xander Berkeley as an ethically challenged lawman), the film manages to be exciting, endearing, amusing, and really quite amazing.

""Shanghai Knights,"" while not as good a film, and with a lesser director, is still a worthy second outing.  As with most sequels, there is a bit of reaching in order to unpin the happy ending of the first film and reunite the protagonists in a new adventure, but the lack of a more original and compelling script is made up for with some eye popping action (including two sequences that morph the classic bits of Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last"" and Gene Kelly's ""Singin' In The Rain"" into brilliant Chan martial mayhem), and a battle with rival Hong Kong martial arts star Donnie Yen.  Best of all, the odd couple chemistry of fast talking Owen Wilson and fast moving Jackie Chan remains a highlight.  It'a a pity they didn't do more films together.

The combination of both films into a single Blu-ray Disc works fine, due to the increased ability to hold information, and all the special features of the individual DVDs are included as well.  The upgrade in image is substantial, and the price is reasonable, so if you really like either or both of these films, the Blu-ray is worth getting.",1369180800,12,2080,4.836619718309859

3011066,4,B000Y11BC6,i love shanghai noon... shanghai knights not so much. i think this is worth it because you get two movies for the price of one thats it but if you can find shanghai knights for cheaper i would just buy that,1267660800,2,206,4.048780487804878
3011067,5,B000Y11BC6,it is nice to have the two movies packaged together in one collection. i bought both movies on their own. i wound up scratching both dvd's. when i saw that amazon had the two movies packaged toghether i just had to buy. it is worth the money to purchase this dvd. i would reccomend purchasing this item instead of the two movies on their own.,1264636800,6,342,4.276923076923077

3011069,5,B000Y11BC6,"I like action movies with some humor and these fit the bill.  I'm not into martial arts for itself and had bought Shanghai Noon on VHS mainly because Owen Wilson was in it and I like his comedy.  The combination of him with Chan is, at least in these two movies, irresistible.  I don't know about anyone else, but these are great movies for me.",1242518400,4,344,4.2615384615384615
3011070,2,B000Y11BC6,"Once again, I see an attractively priced set of films that I'd like to purchase, until I notice that it's only available if you purchase the full-screen version of the film.  I first noticed this when I was looking to purchase 'Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit'.  They had a nice set where you could also get all of the Wallace and Gromit shorts along with the film.  Since the set only included the full-screen version of the film, I passed and bought the wide-screen version separately.  Next, this past Christmas season I looked to see if they were selling a boxed set of the three 'Santa Clause' films.  I was happy to see that amazon was, for the very reasonable price of $30.49.  Happy, that is, until I saw that you could only get the set if you didn't mind missing 30% or so of the film - you know, like you do if you watch it in full-screen.  Now this, another set I'd like to get - but I'll be darned if I'll buy in in full-screen.  I can only assume that these sets are available like this because retailers are left with massive amounts of copies of these various films in the full-screen format, so they package them in the hope that people won't notice that they're full-screen, or else will be so happy to save a couple of bucks that they'll take the inferior format.  Not me - I'd rather pay a couple of bucks extra to see the film the way it was supposed to be seen.",1235952000,7,1402,4.260377358490566

3245356,5,B000Y11BC6,"I have been a western fan all of my life, and I hate it when movie maker make fun of the genre. But these two are so well done and funny, they are the exception to my rule. Jackie is  funny and a brilliant martial arts expert/stunt man, and Owen Wilson was never more perfect for a wannabe western bad man/American hipster. There are many action packed hilarious scenes throughout both films with Roy (not Roger) Owen Wilson and Jackie (John Wayne) Chan, lousy name for a western hero. Some fun points in Shanghai Knights that tickled me were the fact that they were helped in London by and inspector Doyle, Artie to be exact, and the bad guy is Lord Rathbone. An actor named Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes in many film. Also notice the pop music hits that back up that punctuates the film. I think both will keep your attention and laughing through the movies.",1455062400,,862,4.490445859872612

3245434,5,B000Y11BC6,"I like both these movies so when I fond I could get them as a twin-pak, I immediately ordered the pair.

SHANGHAI NOON:  This is a fun movie full of Jackie Chan feats  to delight the eye and boggle the mind.  Owen Wilson is great as the totally inept braggart of a bankrobber who is basically good at heart, and the two make a great enough team to film a sequel to this story.  There are cliches galore, little in-jokes about Westerns, etc., through the characters names, snarky remarks, and even posters on the sides of barns. It's fast-paced and funny, with plenty of recognizable faces who've since become more recognizable in TV series.

SHANGHAI KNIGHTS: With the music to ""England Swings like a Pendulum Do' in the background the two hapless heroes arrive in London and are immediately thrown into havoc and mayhem as they meet a young Scotland Yard man named Arthur Conan Doyle who's attempting to use a new method of ratiocination to solve crimes.  The puns fly thickly in words as well as in the background music. The fight scenes are as energetic and fantastic as expected.  It's ridiculous, sarcastic, and tongue-in-cheek with a few risque moments here and there.

These are two fun movies and I recommend them.",1433203200,,1222,4.699530516431925

3245518,4,B000Y11BC6,"With the success of ""Rush Hour"" in 1998, more films to showcase martial arts movie star Jackie Chan continued well into the 2000s and this time around, pairing him with actor Owen Wilson in the martial arts action comedy western film titled ""Shanghai Noon"".

Earning over $99 million in the box office, the film featured the filmmaking debut of Tom Dey (""Showtime"", ""Failure to Launch"") and feature a screenplay written by writing duo Miles Millar and Alfred Gough (""Spider-Man 2, ""I Am Number Four"", ""Smallville"").

The film featured an all-star cast with Jackie Chan (""Rush Hour"" films, ""The Karate Kid"", ""Shinjuku Incident""), Owen Wilson (""Midnight in Paris"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Cars"" films), Lucy Liu (""Kill Bill: Vol. 1, ""Lucky Number Slevin"", ""Charlie's Angels""), Roger Yuan (""Batman Begins"", ""Skyfall"", ""Syriana"") and Xander Berkeley (""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", ""Air Force One"", ""Gattaca"", ""Taken"").

With the success of ""Shanghai Noon"" in the box office, it would guarantee a sequel in 2003 titled ""Shanghai Knights"" but this time directed by David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Fred Claus"", ""The Change-Up"").  But bringing back both writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.

VIDEO:

""Shanghai Noon/Shanghai Knights: 2-Movie Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Having owned both DVD's, picture quality for both films look amazing on Blu-ray!  Colors are much more vibrant, the film doesn't look like it's nearly 14-years-old.  Colors are vibrant and sharp outdoors, black levels are nice and deep.  If anything, both films definitely looks much better in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Shanghai Knights"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital (note: Spanish is 5.1 on ""Shanghai Noon"" and 2.0 on ""Shanghai Knights"").  I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that the films did not receive a DTS-HD Master Audio conversion as most films from Buena Vista or Touchstone Home Entertainment receive a lossless audio conversion.  With that being said, both films had active surround Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks when they were released on DVD.  As can be said with the soundtrack on Blu-ray!  Good use of surround channels for the action sequences and LFE, while the second film tend to utilize the music soundtrack a bit more with its modern music.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It was a chance to see a different side of Jackie Chan, combining martial arts, action and western?  Who would of thought that this concept would work?  But in 2000, people came out to see Jackie Chan, the legendary martial arts actor who has been in movies since the 1960s.

While many Americans saw Jackie Chan in the popular 1981 film ""The Cannonball Run"", while martial arts fans were treated with fantastic Jackie Chan films through the '80s such as the ""Police Story"" films, ""Supercop"" films and ""The Legend of Drunken Master"", many had to import these films or watch them at a film festival.

Until 1995 and many had the opportunity to see Jackie Chan in a film that was dubbed but tailored to Western tastes with ""Rumble in the Bronx"".  This led to past films he made, being dubbed in English and being released in theaters or direct-to-video and by 1997, he was making films such as ""Mr. Nice Guy"" and ""Who Am I?"".

But it's the police comedy ""Rush Hour"", where people had a chance to see a film directed by an American and combining Jackie Chan's martial arts skills with comedy, playing opposite to an American talent.  ""Rush Hour"" was a box office success and would spawn two more films, writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar would create an action western but utilizing another American collaboration with Jackie Chan but with Owen Wilson, who was not the big star as he would later become, as the only major films he had appeared in were ""The Haunting"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Anaconda"".  Suffice to say, ""Shanghai Noon"" would continue showcasing Jackie Chan as the legendary martial arts actor on the big screen, while Owen Wilson would show that he can do comedy films and be a headliner.

The film would also allow Jackie Chan to incorporate his Hong Kong fight choreography using his crew, but also working with an American crew to have an East meets West type of production, but to also showcase Jackie Chan's Buster Keaton physical comedy-style that he has been known for.

""Shanghai Noon"" would go on to make over $99 million and in 2003, it sequel ""Shanghai Knights"" would go on to make over $88 million.

It has probably been a decade or more since I have watched each of these films.  At the time, I was still on a Jackie Chan high, and really wanting to watch every film that he has starred in.  One thing that we know about Jackie Chan is that he is an actor that is so dedicated, but also willing to sacrifice his body in order to make these films.  He makes it look easy, when you know, he's probably been hurt countless times while shooting the film.

My thoughts on ""Shanghai Noon"" was that the film gave Jackie Chan a chance to show that collaborations between an Eastern fight staff and a Western staff can be done and how important fight scenes are in getting the timing right.  That is the experience that Jackie Chan brings to a film.

While ""Rush Hour"" plays on the racial card for a lot of its humor, ""Shanghai Noon"" is more or less about two guys who were not that great at what they do.  Jackie Chan was not a good Imperial Guard and Owen Wilson was not a good Outlaw.  But these two found a way to work with each other and take on significant odds.  It's a classic story of underdogs managing to get the job done!

""Shanghai Noon"" also starred Lucy Liu who was best known during the '90s and early 2000s for ""Ally McBeal"" but 2000 would prove to be a banner year for Liu who would star in both ""Shanghai Noon"" and as one of the angels in ""Charlie's Angels"".

But the film was fun and a pure popcorn action film with two unlikely talents to be put together in a film and it worked!

As for ""Shanghai Knights"", the film tries to bank on new director David Dobkin (who would later direct comedy films ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Fred Claus"" and ""The Change-Up"").  When I watched this in the theater back in 2003, there were a few things that bothered me about the film.

For one, how would they address the women that were part of the lives of Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon from the first film, how would they utilize one of the most well-known martial arts actors from Hong Kong with Donnie Yen and how would the story be with the characters leaving America and going straight to London.

While bringing the story to London would allow for great play of names such as Charlie Chaplin and Artie Doyle (or Arthur Conan Doyle), it's one thing to have fun with that.  But the problem was that the writers tried to take what made the first film enjoyable but taking them out of the western environment and bringing them London.  It just didn't seem right, nor did the character of Rathbone in the beginning, killing Wong's father.  The character didn't seem ominous, he looked too much like singer, Josh Groban.

And while Jackie Chan was able to deliver in action as expected, the story also suffers from third wheel problems, by giving too much time for Chon Lin.  While it's great for the film to showcase Fann Wong in action scenes, I often wondered if they knew how awesome of an actor  Donnie Yen was.  This could have led to one of the greatest matchups in an American martial arts film (ie. think Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li), but instead, they gave more screentime to the character of Rathbone and it just didn't seem right. The battle between Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen's characters just fell flat and how it ends was just terrible.  The utilization of supporting characters and antagonists didn't seem right and while the film was OK, ""Shanghai Noon"" was so much better!

As for the Blu-ray release, having owned both DVD's of the films, both films definitely look so much better in High Definition, but I was surprised both did not receive the lossless treatment.  Both are Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS-HD MA 5.1 and I found that to be surprising.  But both had wonderful soundtracks when they were released on DVD years ago and still sounds active through the surround channels and a bit of LFE utilized as well for this Blu-ray release.  Both films are featured on one Blu-ray disc.  You also get all the DVD special features content included with this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Shanghai Noon/Shanghai Knights: 2- Movie Collection"" are entertaining as popcorn action comedy films.  These films are definitely not the best Jackie Chan films, nor his worst.  But I found these films much more easier to stomach without the racial comedy as seen in the ""Rush Hour"" films.

""Shanghai Noon"" was a much better film than it sequel ""Shanghai Knights"" and while I don't see a third film ever being released (especially with Jackie Chan's comments on America and his previous American films made earlier this year), the release of both films back in the early 2000s was about interest in both talents, good timing and the timing was just right as people wanted to see more of Jackie Chan, the martial arts action star and Owen Wilson, the up-and-coming star.

For those who enjoy this film, while it doesn't have the lossless soundtrack, it's definitely worth upgrading for the picture quality and I do recommend this ""Shanghai Noon/Shanghai Knights: 2- Movie Collection"" for fans of the two films or are fans of  Jackie Chan or Owen Wilson.",1372896000,5,11564,4.85145482388974

3245535,5,B000Y11BC6,"""Shanghai Noon"" has long been one of my favorite American Jackie Chan films, featuring not only classic Chan combats but also a partnership with a non-Asian actor that is lively and enlightening instead of depressing and demeaning;  it was directed by a JC fan who was invested in presenting the Hong Kong Jackie persona that the world loves in a more Hollywood format that American audiences were comfortable with, and Tom Dey absolutely got it right.

With a witty ""fish out of water"" story that pays homage to the great Westerns (from glossing ""High Noon"" to naming Chan  a Chinese sound-alike for John Wayne) while playing havoc with the genre's conventions, and a great cast from both East and West (supporting standouts include HK martial arts actor Yu Rong-guan using an array of Chinese weaponry, American Roger Yuan playing an Imperial villain, and Xander Berkeley as an ethically challenged lawman), the film manages to be exciting, endearing, amusing, and really quite amazing.

""Shanghai Knights,"" while not as good a film, and with a lesser director, is still a worthy second outing.  As with most sequels, there is a bit of reaching in order to unpin the happy ending of the first film and reunite the protagonists in a new adventure, but the lack of a more original and compelling script is made up for with some eye popping action (including two sequences that morph the classic bits of Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last"" and Gene Kelly's ""Singin' In The Rain"" into brilliant Chan martial mayhem), and a battle with rival Hong Kong martial arts star Donnie Yen.  Best of all, the odd couple chemistry of fast talking Owen Wilson and fast moving Jackie Chan remains a highlight.  It'a a pity they didn't do more films together.

The combination of both films into a single Blu-ray Disc works fine, due to the increased ability to hold information, and all the special features of the individual DVDs are included as well.  The upgrade in image is substantial, and the price is reasonable, so if you really like either or both of these films, the Blu-ray is worth getting.",1369180800,12,2080,4.836619718309859

3245557,4,B000Y11BC6,This is pretty funny...maybe because I love Owen Wilson...but I don't feel as if you are wasting time that you will never get back. It's all good if you are just looking for some silly laughs.,1303171200,,192,4.361111111111111

3245563,4,B000Y11BC6,i love shanghai noon... shanghai knights not so much. i think this is worth it because you get two movies for the price of one thats it but if you can find shanghai knights for cheaper i would just buy that,1267660800,2,206,4.048780487804878
3245564,5,B000Y11BC6,it is nice to have the two movies packaged together in one collection. i bought both movies on their own. i wound up scratching both dvd's. when i saw that amazon had the two movies packaged toghether i just had to buy. it is worth the money to purchase this dvd. i would reccomend purchasing this item instead of the two movies on their own.,1264636800,6,342,4.276923076923077

3245566,5,B000Y11BC6,"I like action movies with some humor and these fit the bill.  I'm not into martial arts for itself and had bought Shanghai Noon on VHS mainly because Owen Wilson was in it and I like his comedy.  The combination of him with Chan is, at least in these two movies, irresistible.  I don't know about anyone else, but these are great movies for me.",1242518400,4,344,4.2615384615384615
3245567,2,B000Y11BC6,"Once again, I see an attractively priced set of films that I'd like to purchase, until I notice that it's only available if you purchase the full-screen version of the film.  I first noticed this when I was looking to purchase 'Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit'.  They had a nice set where you could also get all of the Wallace and Gromit shorts along with the film.  Since the set only included the full-screen version of the film, I passed and bought the wide-screen version separately.  Next, this past Christmas season I looked to see if they were selling a boxed set of the three 'Santa Clause' films.  I was happy to see that amazon was, for the very reasonable price of $30.49.  Happy, that is, until I saw that you could only get the set if you didn't mind missing 30% or so of the film - you know, like you do if you watch it in full-screen.  Now this, another set I'd like to get - but I'll be darned if I'll buy in in full-screen.  I can only assume that these sets are available like this because retailers are left with massive amounts of copies of these various films in the full-screen format, so they package them in the hope that people won't notice that they're full-screen, or else will be so happy to save a couple of bucks that they'll take the inferior format.  Not me - I'd rather pay a couple of bucks extra to see the film the way it was supposed to be seen.",1235952000,7,1402,4.260377358490566
3245568,5,B000Y11BC6,I like these movies very much. Both actors did a great job and kept me laughing. Would recommend to those who like these actors and want some good laughs.,1233100800,,154,4.344827586206897
