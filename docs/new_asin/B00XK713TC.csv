7170523,5,B00XK713TC,"A terrific authoring of a terrific movie! A lot has been already said of this movie on IMDB and other cinema forums. This is Anurag Kashyap's magnum opus and truly worthy of a great BD release.
The Cinelicious Blu Ray, comes thru finely, in every aspect - great picture and audio quality and a fair amount of extras. I had purchased an earlier version of this movie on DVD (authored by Eagle) and was terribly disappointed by what they offered. However this version sets a new benchmark and its authoring was supervised and approved by the director so what you are seeing the definitive version.

Highly recommended (the Cinelicious BD only).",1442966400,2,642,4.783783783783784
7170524,5,B00XK713TC,"This is an epic, violent, long sprawling gangster movie. It follows these characters lives over 7 decades through two 2.5 hour movies. They will both be included on this blu-ray release.  This movie was made in 2012 but just got its first american theatrical release earlier in 2015. There were imports of this movie that i heard had awful quality. This movie is in IMDB's top 250 (deservedly so) with a 95% on rottentomatoes as well as 89% on metacritic and a 4/4 from rogerebert.com . a must see",1435190400,7,497,4.584269662921348
7170525,3,B00XK713TC,"Generally, the movie is okay. There are parts that are better than others. Struggling with the idea it was worth a gangs of wassapur 2.",1434153600,,135,4.44

8716103,1,B00XK713TC,No strong charactersense other than protagonist.  Could have done better by including lyrics folk music of the region. Weak movie overall.,1473638400,,138,5.571428571428571

8716106,5,B00XK713TC,"As long as you can handle subtitles (and as a film lover you should), you need to see this film. It is north of four hours long and I binge-watched the entire thing with no difficulty whatsoever and wanted more. This is a engaging crime-family story like you've never seen before. They start out with fists, then knives, then home-made handguns that blow up in their hands. By the end of the film they're using AK 47s. It is great!",1461456000,5,431,4.4

8716108,5,B00XK713TC,"Ridiculously great crime drama, spanning the course of an epic 80-year blood feud between two warring mafia families. The Cinelicious blu-ray is high quality A/V-wise, but be warned the English subs have a few typos. Still very much worth getting though.",1459900800,5,254,5.219512195121951
8716109,4,B00XK713TC,"The movie is extremely violent. The ""bad guys"" at that moment are bad shots but it doesn't screen as a over staged fight. Actions have consequences and people die, sometimes needlessly.
I have no trouble recommending this movie to my most of my friends. It is 5 hours of ""oh no. Here it comes.""",1453680000,4,294,4.462962962962963
