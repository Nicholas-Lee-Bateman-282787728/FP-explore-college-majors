7946127,5,B00005MMMP,"Although Cocco did receive some exposure in the U.S.A  in 1997 , it was not until i brought the film 'Kotoko' (2012) that  I knew of her. I am a huge fan of PJ Harvey, Kristen Hersh, The Breeders through to Some Girls. I hear a lot of PJ Harvey in Cocco's music, there is one song that sounds like it belongs to ""To Bring You My Love"". The musicianshiip of  the backing band is on par with any indies band, and completly caught me by surpise. Most songs are in Japanese,  and I do not know Japanese. Being a fan of The Cocteau Twins made it a non iissue, it just meant feeling the songs more, instead of seeing them more which I find when listening to English lyrics. And the videos are some of best I have seen.
I have spent a lot of time and energy  tracking down anything and everything by Cocco, Cocco Best Clips (there are three versions) is worth more than the asking price , much more.
