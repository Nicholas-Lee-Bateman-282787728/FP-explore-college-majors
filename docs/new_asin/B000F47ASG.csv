I hope they will ask for it for years to come.",1425340800,,136,3.566666666666667
8182041,1,B000F47ASG,"When it arrived the video box was in French, not English. I sent it back and am still waiting for resolution. The shipper says it is common for videos to be in both French on one side and English on the other and I should have kept it and reversed the liner????? I did not want to open something first and then try to send it back. It was sent with no explanation of what to do.

I do have another Maggie and the Ferocious Beast video that my daughter loves but we bought it elsewhere. I'm going to consider it a loss as I doubt I will get any resolution with this. I will update this if I get this resolved. It was shipped through Inet Video.",1179100800,,643,4.0234375
