3781876,5,B001RXB4K4,i love it that they have this whole collection !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and also if u like teen titans u need to buy this !!!!!!!!!!!,1338768000,,132,4.782608695652174
3781877,2,B001RXB4K4,"Teen Titans is a great series, but as the prices stand now (as of March, 2012) it's cheaper to buy each of the seasons individually rather than in this combo pack. Just some friendly advice.",1332633600,10,190,4.457142857142857
3781878,5,B001RXB4K4,"My husband and l bought this for our 3 1/2 year old daughter.  It's her favorite show.  We all love watching Teen Titans.  It's now becoming my 5 1/2 year son's favorite as well.  May be funny, but it's true.  I find myself watching episodes of Titans even when my kids are in bed for the night!!  Well written, humorous, good vs. evil it's got it all.
Would recommend to anyone who like superheros!",1326844800,4,399,4.324324324324325
3781879,5,B001RXB4K4,"I had several programs recorded before they went off the air, but the kids and I had seen them all numerous times.  For us, this was well worth the price as they both love TT and it's a cartoon I can handle.  We usually get up and dance around when the theme song comes on since it is so catchy and I was pleasantly surprised when we heard there are a few of the songs in Japanese, just like they were on TV.  If you're a TT fan, I recommend the whole set.  One irritant, there are two DVDs in each box and the flimsy hinge holding one of the DVDs arrived broken in most of the boxes.",1316822400,,584,3.9237288135593222
3781880,5,B001RXB4K4,"This is a fun tv series that my 7 year old watched in syndication and now has revisited at age 11.

Although not entirely true to the comic books, this is still fun to watch.  The animation is stylized, but it does not detract from the story.  The rapport and interaction between characters is consistent and the scenes are cohesive with the metaplot that comes together in Season Five.

Very similar to the Batman series and Superman series, but not as dark, and with more humor.

The complete Seasons 1-5 does not come in a sleeve or have different artwork that span the cases.  It is simply 5 DVD cases shrink wrapped together.  It's a good buy because they did split up Season 1&2 and for the seasons combined, this is your cheapest and most straight forward run.

Don't forget the Teen Titan's movie, Trouble in Tokyo, and their upcoming film next year in 2011 (so we hope!)",1273017600,24,879,4.518987341772152

3781882,4,B001RXB4K4,These DVDs put together all episodes of Teen Titans (excluding the post-series movie) in one neat shrink-wrapped package.

3781892,5,B001RXB4K4,"Still holds up, and it's Americanime, the first of its kind. Beautiful yet bizarre art. Dramatic american style but it endures constant metamorphosis into Japanese hyperbole. What I mean to say is that it when it gets too hilarious it is also often still mature and well directed enough to maintain emotional impression.

3781897,3,B001RXB4K4,"Loved that season 1 and 2 are even with french dub, what happened with the rest? English dub is fine, and the fifth season, the menu is terrible... it seems a cheap creation ... until the fourth was great the menus... the boxes are so delicate.... why you can't invest in a better material? At least I am happy with this serie, I really love the teen titans.",1507420800,,358,4.279411764705882
3781898,5,B001RXB4K4,"Fantastic series. There is comedy, action, and drama all in one series. It is rare that a show masters seriousness and comedy. This is easily one of the best animated series ever made.
Interestingly, there aren't any episodes that are bad. Some are nowhere near as interesting as others, but the series never gets annoying or insulting towards the audience like many cartoons today.
The highpoint of the series would be Season 4. It is extremely dark with implied rape (you'll know if you read the comics).
The lowpoint would be Season 3's story arc's finale. It is pretty lame how Brother Blood wants to turn himself into a Cyborg. It isn't explained very well, and I suspect the writers simply got lazy in rapping this story arc up.",1506988800,,734,4.6976744186046515

My only negative was with the shipper. The delivery date kept changing and changing until about a month later I finally got my product (meanwhile, I'm a Prime member and was to have receive this within 2 days).",1506038400,,385,4.260273972602739

I wanted to get this series before the actual live action movie came out so I could familiarize myself with the characters - bad guys - plot and so on once again.  I am giving this 4 stars because I received duplicates of season 5 and there was no Season 3 in my set.  No biggie really you always take a chance when ordering anything online.  I know some people received all the seasons and others had certain seasons missing and duplicates of others.  I will just order the season I don't have seperately... like I said not a HUGE disappointment but packaging should be thought out more carefully.",1493164800,9,687,4.3700787401574805

3781947,5,B001RXB4K4,"Got this for my boyfriend's b-day & he LOVES it, as do I!!! Great marathoning times!!! AWESOME CHARACTERS, ARTWORK, ETC.!!!

My only complaints are:
*they ended at Season 5 with no final wrap up
T_T

*the continuing of Teen Titans is Teen Titans Go (shivers; WHY?!?!)
IF YOU'RE A PARENT & HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GREAT CULTURE & COMPLETE GARBAGE THEN I'D RECOMMEND TEEN TITANS (NOT TEEN TITANS GO UNLESS YOU WANT JERKY KIDS WITH NO CONSIDERATION OF OTHERS!!!)

Best way to show between the 2:
*There's a character called Cyborg who's literally around 90% machine & 10% human. In order to take down a school for villains, they decided the best way to take it down was to have someone go undercover to school there. Cyborg invents a ring that allows him to look completely human due to what human features he has left. (I barely recognized him at all!) So Cyborg has the ring on & is checkin' himself in the mirror going, ""Oh, yeah~"" & flexing his muscles & what-not when he notices his co-worker, Starfire, in his room. Embarrassed, he asks how long she's been standing there. She replies not long & continues saying she thinks his new form is pretty cool, but that she prefers the ""original version"". He replies, ""This is the original version."" THE FEELS!!!!!!!!!!!

*(I've only seen 1 ep. of Go, but 1 is just enough to justify not watching any further.) There's an episode where the main 5 superhero characters are in a dodge ball tournament. They only have 1 more team to defeat: actual ""villains"" (like from the villain school) who PLAY BY THE RULES TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE & THEY ARE THE VILLAINS(?!). Anyhow, the ""superheros"" see how great their team is because they are beating them. Instead of being good sports, they decide to CHEAT. & they DO. & they WIN. But there needs to be a moral lesson right?! HA, I laugh at you! The bad guys find out they cheated & confront them & they go, ""So? YOU'RE the bad guys, we're the good guys, we can arrest you any time we want!"" AFTER SAYING THIS, OTHER GOOD GUYS (special police?) TAKE THE BAD GUYS AWAY & THE SO-CALLED ""SUPERHEROS"" PARTY FOR THEIR ""VICTORY"". I KID YOU NOT, WHO WOULD DO THIS?!?!

...Ahem, anyhow, JUST TEEN TITANS PLEASE!!!",1479254400,13,2190,4.548223350253807

I could of always sent it back but I really didn't like that episode anyway. I especially needed this ever since I've seen the new TV show ""Teen titans Go"".

It's stylish but catchy opening theme music (sung by Puffy AmiYumi) that came in English and Japanese made it stand apart from the norm. It's writing style was entertaining, comical and well thought out without breaking it's unique quality. Diverse in many different subjects without necessarily repeating what other shows have already done. The characters have very lively personalities without being cliche and their interactions with one another are amusing, heart warming and moralistic. Warner Bros. have done an excellent job of bringing back a DC comic classic, giving it a modern touch, with a Japanese sense of humor and a twist of romance drama.

Well-written and terrifically animated with bits of humor slipped in at just the right times, the series holds the interest of viewers of all ages.  The storylines usually have a bit of a moral or an inspiration but are never preachy.  I recommend it to any family that loves superheroes and anime!",1415059200,7,430,4.3375
3782163,5,B001RXB4K4,"I've been a big fan of Teen Titans for a long time. I remember watching the show religiously back when it was fresh on the air, as well as being a huge fan of Deathstroke and Raven of DC in particular. I'm still very fond of the depictions of the Titans and other heroes/villains from the DC world  in this show. It is very well written, giving great depth to the characters. You get a real sense of familiarity with Raven's troubles and what drives her, or Robin's desire to be the same kind of strict and perfectly trained hero that Batman is. Even the less commonly appearing characters feel well flushed out. Which is another thing; there are a lot of great DC references and cameo appearances!
There have been those who've complained that Deathstroke was renamed to simply ""Slade"", due to the complaints of the word 'Death' in the name, but this doesn't bother me, since MANY heroes and villains alike refer to the character as 'Slade' in the comics across it's existence. His personality and actions are a little different from what you'd see in most Deathstroke fiction, but this is because it focuses on his time as the primary antagonist to the Titans. Being that (duh) it's a Teen Titans show, not a Deathstroke one. His frighteningly cool and collected attitude and perfected tactics and combat abilities reflect well the kind of villain Slade can really be. The show does not disappoint.
It'll always be an absolute top choice for comic book adaptation in my eyes, and is likely my favorite animated adaptation overall. DC's characters and worlds really shine in the Teen Titans series. I absolutely suggest this to anyone who loves DC, and can accept the negligible to moderate changes made in the adaptation.",1413936000,19,1722,4.74
3782164,3,B001RXB4K4,"The set is packaged together after-market as a set, which is fine, but a bit misleading for a ""Complete Series.""

3782170,5,B001RXB4K4,"Love the series and it's great to watch it all over again. It's too bad it didn't go on for longer. I hate the new dumbed down kiddie version. It's so terrible and just makes me glad that I own this series. The quality is the same as when it aired on tv. The only thing I would have liked is the ability to skip the intro. I own other cartoon series on DVD where they were kind enough to let you skip the intro to the start of the episode, but I guess they didn't care to allow you that option for this DVD series. The voice acting is great, if you are a fan of DC and teen titans it's great to own. It's not really accurate to the comics, but I like the different approach they went with.

This is not any different from the individual seasons that you can purchase individually. All amazon really did is put all 5 separate seasons and wrap them together. I wish they would have released a complete series edition, which probably will happen years later which will really bug the hell out of me. Sometimes it's cheaper to buy all 5 separately since prices go down. I've been monitoring the price difference between the complete and individual seasons, and I just decided to buy the complete set when the prices were the same as individual seasons.",1406246400,,1248,4.288135593220339

All of the discs were included, in tact and in near perfect condition. There were no skips, ""unreadable media"" or poor sound quality. It took longer than I expected for it to get to my address, but I don't think that that's the fault of the seller or the site.

The series is just as I remember it, funny, deep, a bit dark and very real, even considering the fact that none of it could occur.

A good price, for great quality for an excellent show. Thanks to amazon and the seller, five of five",1399248000,,605,4.252173913043478

3782193,5,B001RXB4K4,I started watching this show in 2003 at the age of 12 when this aired along with my 7 year old sister. Ten years later and now ages 22 and 17 we have recently rediscovered this on Boomerang (making us feel a little old after remembering these episodes airing originally). We love this show and we have seen the new short animated series and have had a few chuckles with it. It is nice to have all the episodes on DVD and not have to stay up late on Mon-Fri. The only minor quibble is the day I went to go buy the complete series (for my sister's birthday) all together the price was raised at least $10 from what it was when I checked it two days before. I decided to buy the seasons individually and in the process this saved me some money. I advise all who think of buying the complete series to double/triple check as I did.,1381968000,,827,4.142857142857143

Every episode, some bonus features, it's great! The only problem (at least to me) is season 5. It just leaves a cliffhanger and is pretty cliche.

3782205,5,B001RXB4K4,"What else is there to say?

Alongside the Justice League animated series, Teen Titans is my favorite animated show. The show spends a lot of time dealing wht the characters, making them actual people, and I just love the entire cast:

Robin is stoic and intelligent, a Batman in miniature. His only weakness is his obsession with Slade and his inability to let go and have a little fun.
Raven pretty much defines the term ""Goth Girl,"" but you still can't help falling in love with her just a little bit more every time she's on the screen.
Cyborg and Beast Boy are the heart and soul of the Titans. Always cheerful and ready with the hijinks, I can't figure out which one makes me laugh harder... or which one would scare me more in a fight.
And Starfire... her smile is like sunshine. Her voice like a breath of fresh air. For a girl that can bodyslam a fire truck, she is possibly the sweetest alien you'll ever meet.

If you love superheros, and if you're not a stick in the mud, you will love this show.",1366761600,18,1007,4.345744680851064

I couldn't believe how much story and development could be shown! The theme song is wonderful! It's right up there with the Spongebob theme as the greatest TV show theme song ever! I love the drama of this show and the balanced mixture of comedy. Neither of them are overdone! What I really love about this show too is Beast Boy. He's just a great comic relief, not to mention he has all three of my favorite colors on him-black, purple, and green. The other titans are great too; Starfire's pleasantly naive but fierce in battle, Raven is gloomy but sarcastic, Cyborg's booyas and huge appetite are great, the comedy list goes on. I like how the episodes vary from funny like ""Bunny Raven"" or dark the Season 4 story arc episodes ""Birthmark"", ""The Prophecy"", and ""The End, Parts 1-3"". I just adore it! This is a wonderful show balanced for kids and adults of any age.",1365811200,,1009,4.580110497237569
