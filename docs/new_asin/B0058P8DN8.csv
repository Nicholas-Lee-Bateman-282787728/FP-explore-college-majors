The writing is exactly correct, it goes from the beginning to the middle and the end. The magic of the rock booms like thunder. I dare you to watch it once because that's impossible. Anger is his middle name!!",1416528000,,371,4.23943661971831
8462160,5,B0058P8DN8,This is an absolute own for any THOR fan! Disregard the negative reviews. Get some of the best THOR footage ever captured right here! Killer stuff from the God of Metal Thunder!,1320624000,,177,4.5625
8462161,4,B0058P8DN8,"Got this recently because I am a longtime fan of THOR...got all his records & cd releases. Had to have this to add to the collection - includes some great old live stuff I've never seen and some other rare stuff. I wouldn't make this the introductory video to new THOR fans, but for old fans like me its a welcome addition.",1320624000,2,323,4.225806451612903
8462162,1,B0058P8DN8,"This is truly the worst attempt at being smart, entertaining, or worthwhile that I have ever seen.  The graphic are amaturish. The photography just bad.  The music maybe OK but you are so distracted by the bad that you do not get to think of the good there may be in the music.  You can have my copy free, if I do not simply trash it first.",1320192000,,340,4.044776119402985
8462163,4,B0058P8DN8,that is fun to watch showing the evolution of the band from the 70s to now. If you are a fan of Thor you will enjoy this video especially the live footage from his concerts. WE LIVE TO ROCK!!,1318377600,,191,3.923076923076923
8462164,1,B0058P8DN8,"Here's what the Rock Opera is:
A collection of the same Thor videos and live songs that are available on the Anthology DVD and youtube. On this Rock Opera DVD, they play all the same videos and have a narrator tell a story over the music videos. The only new content for this DVD is a brief battle sequence with a Thor body double and old unseen footage of Thor spliced in. There's really no new footage of Jon Mikl Thor. As a fan I'm very disappointed. If I go to see a movie sequel, I don't want to see old footage re-edited and sold to me as a new project.",1312675200,5,559,4.045045045045045
