In the midst of the mafia representatives visit all hell breaks  loose. before you know it the IRA has blown up a number of his businesses  and he has no idea who or why. The manner in which he picked up and  interrogated other gangland characters was interesting ( see the movie )  and his explosion at his chief lieutenant, and subsequent murder, is  appaling.

""The Long Good Friday""

Rating: 5

Title: Shand is ambitious, charismatic, uncompromising and he is a gangster

""The Long Good Friday"" tells its narrative in an unusual way,

The opening sequences are a pastiche of seemingly dissimilar violent happenings; the gel that holds them together is the enthralling musical theme. As the film progresses we are eventually let into an explanation. It's all a huge misunderstanding, grounded on unwise pronouncements taken by Shand's minions and misconstrued by the provisional IRA, who feel their interests are threatened. While the audience knows the real events that caused the problem, and eventually Shand does, it appears that the provisional IRA is none the wiser. The climatic ending and the movie's final scenes are, quite simply, with the zooming in of the camera, held for effect, of Shand's sneering face in full detail, as his eyes shift from side to side, and eventually his mouth breaks into a terrified grin, as it dawns on him on how it feels to get a dose of his own medicine.

This movie is one remarkable piece of work, not only for the late Mr Hoskins performance but also for the synergy of the cinematography, the power of the musical composition, and, in a strange way the rather appealing nature of its at times very violent sense of humour. This is an excellent piece of 20th century British cinema making and is therefore highly recommended.",1411344000,,1427,4.949790794979079

771999,5,6304080018,"Bob Hoskins, the star of this film, died this past week, in his 70s of Parkinson's Disease. It seems a fitting time to review his very best film, The Long Good Friday. He made a lot of great films, seemingly effortlessly, but he never surpassed this one.

He is Harold a gangster in London who has done very well for himself. He has a casino, a yacht, fancy car, Helen Mirren as his long term girlfriend....what more could any guy wish for if he was lower class and wanted to vault into the monied class? Well, nothing material but Harold has a big problem develop nonetheless. Someone is suddenly very interested in eliminating Harold and everyone he knows for seemingly no reason whatsoever. Harold has done nothing different from his usual ""accepted"" criminal endeavors so what in the heck is going on?

Part of the answer is to be found in a minor character in the film. None other than Pierce Brosnan in a very early role before anyone knew who he was. You can't miss him because at this young age Brosnan is the most gorgeous male most people have ever set eyes on. If you thought he was good looking later on, wait until you see him here. Surprisingly, Brosnan is one of the bad guys!

This film put both Helen Mirren and Bob Hoskins on the map in the film world. They would work non stop from this film forward. I don't think Brosnan ever had a lapse either.  But the primary moving force of the film is Hoskins, the exposition of his character. Whatever you might feel about Harold all through the movie, there is a long scene in a taxi cab near the end where you have to give him his due for sheer guts and unflinching indomitability. That taxi scene is a classic of the cinema which no film fan can ever forget.

They gave it good try, but the chief problem with the movie is that it just isn't noirish enough to be the film noir that it tries to be, since what we see is all well-lit and technicolor and just doesn't seem menacing enough.  The Godfather movies proved you could do gangster movies in color, so maybe the producers didn't study those adequately.  Granted, Hoskins and the rest of the cast are watchable, but the man just never seems quite as menacing as he tries to be. The famous scene in the meat locker, with all his enemies hanging upside down, just doesn't come off, and the scene where Hoskins is talking rough to his longtime mistress (Helen Mirren), then immediately apologizes, just doesn't click (would a gangster that nasty turn into Sensitive Man at a moment's notice?  No way).  The plot is intriguing (gangster trying to turn legit), the movie is never boring, and it does have a very satisfying ending, but I think it's a tad overrated.  The look never seems quite menacing enough, and neither does Hoskins, who just seems too darn likable to be the tough guy he is playing.  Couple him with an animated rabbit and he is in his element, but here, not so great.",1391731200,,1317,4.555084745762712
772054,5,6304080018,"Savagely quiet, `The Long Good Friday' is one of the best mob movies to come out of the 80's, and it stands the test of time thanks to some rich character development and a thrilling performance by Bob Hoskins.  As a ruthless mob boss reaching his hands into the entrepreneur side of things, Hoskins has never been better than he is here.  Such subtle development of passion and pressure before his eventual (and inevitable) combustion.  Every moment of Hoskins' screen time is effectively manipulated to pull us in, right where he wants us, before that unrelenting savagery tears us apart.

That confrontation scene is brutal.

The film tells the story of Harold Shand, mob boss to London's underworld who is trying to hook up with an American partner in order to turn London's docklands into the future home of the Olympics.  The IRA start to bark up Shand's tree, with a series of deadly bombings meant to take him out, and soon Shand finds himself at the short end of the rope trying desperately to pull himself back up to the top.  In the meantime, he's shuffling the support of his wife, the waning interest of American mobsters and suspicious activity of those he considers close associates.

Hoskins is easily the biggest draw here, but he's not the only one to single out.  Derek Thompson has a very integral role and sells his scenes with a brilliantly layered backstory, and Helen Mirren is sensationally underplayed as Shand's wife.  She, like Hoskins, bottles so much and creates such internalized tensions.

Tense from start to finish, and smartly written to make good use of every facet here, this sharp thriller is one of the best out there!",1381795200,,1657,4.778947368421052

I'd never even heard of it before perusing a magazine article about the PS2 game 'The Getaway', which listed its top inspirations from British gangland cinema. Along with Michael Caine's 'Get Carter,' 'The Long Good Friday' properly catches the grit and chagrin of 1970s Britain. Though Hoskins' Harold Shand has raised himself to a different level of the food chain than Caine's Carter. He's a man living in the past, still enamored by the Bentley motors, fat Cuban cigars, the pomp and trappings of a once-was empire as the modern age crashes in around him. Anyway, great film. Keep an eye out for P.H. Moriarity (Hatchet Harry in 'Lock Stock'), Paul Freeman (Belloq of 'Raiders' fame), and a gum-chewing Pierce Brosnan in his first on-screen role.",1359504000,2,813,4.9416058394160585
772056,5,6304080018,"There's Godfather I, Godfather II, and Goodfellas.

The Long, Good Friday is right up there with the all-time great gangster movies.  This is the movie that put Bob Hoskins on the map, playing Harold Shand, the Cockney leader of the London underworld.  And it's not your typical performance of the stereotypical gangster.  Hoskins has nuance as a street thug trying to become legit, as both a businessman and as a lover.

Helen Mirren's take as Victoria also goes against typecast as the gangster moll.  She is sophisticated, loving, yet every bit as cunning as her man.  The two together make this movie.

The first introduction to Shand in the movie as well as the ending sequence are close-ups of Shand.  The ending bit makes movie history as it is a two-minute close-up of Shand's face in which you, the viewer, essentially, read his thoughts. This is movie-making at its best as no words are spoken by Hoskins...but you don't need a word of dialogue to know what he is thinking.

This movie if full of gems...but be forewarned: I've seen this movie about a dozen times and until I bought the book of the screenplay, I couldn't understand much of the dialogue as it is in heavily accented Cockney along with unusual Cockney expressions which lends both the character to the movie as well as some frustration in not understanding exactly what is going on.  Not sure whether this version has subtitles,  which it desperately needs.  Nevertheless, don't let this put you off from seeing what is movie-making history.

Youtube has at least two documentaries that were made on the film over the years; indeed, they may even be included in the extras of this version.  If not, check them out on youtube AFTER you've seen the movie!",1355788800,2,1729,4.75503355704698

772061,4,6304080018,"The Long Good Friday (1980) takes you into the criminal underworld of London, as a mob leader struggles to maintain control over his empire, in a fast paced tale, often punctuated with realistic violence.  In a breakout performance, Bob Hoskins stars as gangster Harold Shand, a no nonsense fellow, with some big ambitions.

Set in the late 70's, Harold Shand is meeting with representatives of the Mafia on a Good Friday weekend, when a series of violent incidents, upsets his normal operations.  Shand learns that a number of his associates have been violently murdered.  Shand, his girlfriend Victoria (Helen Mirren), and his American visitors, narrowly avoid being in caught an explosion, which sets off an intense search to find the source of the unknown threat.

Shand and his men rumble through the underworld, spilling a little blood, threatening those who may know something, and trying to shake loose a little information from rival criminals.  Eventually it comes to light that without his knowledge, one of his men was involved in an incident in Belfast that may have set off reprisals by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).  Vowing to ""crush them like beetles"", Shand takes violent action against IRA representatives, and although his relationship with the Americans goes sour, as he leaves them, Shand feels that things are still looking up.

Stylish, gritty, and British to the core, The Long Good Friday is perhaps the highpoint of John Mackenzie's directorial career.  The violence is plentiful, but never seems gratuitous, and has a genuine sense of realism, as the plot unfolds in a credible and compelling manner.  Featuring an edgy score by Francis Monkman, the film takes a look into organized crime, and taps into the feeling of unrest and terror, that was part of the IRA's mystique.  Experts in demolition, they were not to be taken lightly.

Bob Hoskins thoroughly assumes the role of Shand, which fits him like a perfectly tailored suit.  Displaying a wide range of emotions, Hoskins is tough as nails, while also displaying sensitivity at a widow's loss, shock and anger after killing a close friend, and amusement when dealing with a young street tough.  Helen Mirren is very good, as the acting performances are mostly solid throughout, including the film debut of a youngster named Pierce Brosnan, who would later collaborate with Mackenzie in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fourth-Protocol/dp/B000BMTBI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fourth Protocol</a>&nbsp;(1987).",1334361600,,2544,5.440203562340967

If the above doesn't appear as a live link, then simply copy and past into the address bar of your browser. The news, however, is simple: the disc is single-layered, and the feature doesn't even occupy all the space it could (18gigs, where 25 was available). Screen shots demonstrate that the disc gives a marginally brighter image than the existing SD-DVDs, but is otherwise unremarkable, and has no supplements, not even the supplements on the old Anchor Bay ""Special Edition"" from a few years ago. Detail is mushy, with nothing particularly standing out, though the colours appear to be somewhat improved. It looks to me as if an existing master, of reasonable quality, has simply been turned into a quick blu-ray. What needs to be done is to remaster the film specifically with blu-ray in mind.

When he accidentally kills a betrayer, Bob sobs on his gal's shoulder. Some tough guy! His moments of supposed menace seem almost comical, as there's no real nastiness in Hoskins compared to the great screen gangsters. Bob's a reliably fine actor, but miles away here from his performances in Mona Lisa and others.

Mirren is quite believable though, and the bit players are fair enough; Brosnan has next to no lines and nothing to do, so he hardly counts. My main issue was the very slooow pacing, and the slowly-revealed plot, too slowly in fact, so that we stopped caring who did what and just traded bets on how long before the next corpse showed up, covered with movie blood. I'd suggest taking the under. (Six feet!)

The reviews here comparing this to The Godfather are insane. That film moves well and is full of legendary lines and performances; this film plods along with a vague plot, a weak ending, and very few memorable lines. The direction is haphazard and adds zero tension or menace, apart from, ""What the heck is going on here, who's fighting whom, and why should I care?""

All in all, I expected a lot more from the reviews here, and would have to say this is one of the most disappointing ""gangster"" movies I've ever seen.

772102,5,6304080018,"I like gangster films, Lock stock and two smoking barrels, snatch, layer cake, rock n rolla, scar face, i can't but wonder did long good friday influence these types of films, IMO i think so. I caught this little film gem on netflix. Bob Hoskins gives a great performance, he plays a gangster trying to broker a real estate deal over the easter weekend, entertaining his financiers who are from across the pond... NY, meanwhile everything is slowly unraveling around him, his best trusted man is killed, his mother almost blown up, and a pub he owns gets blown to bits. Meanwhile he is trying to keep the NY financiers from leaving. Helen Mirren who by the way looked very lovely back then when she was younger, plays his mistress and confidant. And watch out for a young Pierce Brosnan as a hitman.

Hoskins plays a mobster with such vitality, grandiose performance, a man almost on the edge, trying so desperately not to come unraveled while all of this is going on. Hoskins plays the character as a man who rather shoot and ask questions later. A gang leader who doesn't like to be screwed with, doesn't want to be the one shoved around, where he does the shoving in this town. Of course with this type of movie it's always this type of character's downfall and in the end what goes around comes around shall I say. I thought the movie had tight direction, a well thought out, steady paced story, viewer getting tidbits on who is betraying hoskins. Oh and the ending, the range of emotions Hoskins is feeling, way he conveys it through his facial expressions with the camera on him for over a minute, can't beat a better performance than that, he showed anger, disbelief, realization, acceptance for his fate.

The movie felt gritty, the underworld of London back in the 70's, early 80's, definitely has that Limey feel, that British flair, as I said I can't but think if Guy Ritchie used this type of story arch for his movies, borrowing elements from Long Good Friday, intricate plot, cast of shady/ interesting characters, witty dialogue, having that underworld London feel.

So if you want to watch an old school Limey gangster film and have all ready seen all of Ritchie's movies, rent this one, you will not be disappointed.",1264982400,,2233,4.66243654822335

772155,4,6304080018,"Before this movie was released, with the exception of Michael Caine`s Get Carter, British gangster movies were little known around the world and even at home, they were little appreciated. With Harold Shand, a brash, rough pint sized gangster on the make, Bob Hoskins changed that and paved the way for a whole raft of gritty crime thrillers set in the British Isles. Although few of the later movies rose to the heights claimed by Caine and Hoskins.

Harold Shand is a London gangster from the old school, he is the man that the real life Kray twins might like to have been, bursting with ruthlessness, animal cunning, aggression, hubris, charisma and ambition he sets out to transform himself into a businessman cum developer who will succeed because the qualities that make him a good gangster will allow him to defeat any legitimate business rival. He is assisted by his girl Victoria (Helen Mirren) - several grades above the classic Barbera Windsor style of gangster`s moll - who understands her man`s strengths and weaknesses and gives him the support and guidance that he needs succeed without threatening his perceived alpha male dominance.

Shand`s big idea is to get in on the development on London`s docklands and to cash in on an upcoming bid to host the Olympic games. He turns to an American crime syndicate for backing and the movie is set on an Easter weekend when he is playing host to mobster Charlie (Eddie Constantine) and Tony (Stephen Davies), Charlie`s lawyer.

Harold`s plans start to come unstuck as his organization quakes under attack from an unknown enemy who is planting bombs and assassinating Harold`s men. Victoria, assisted by Harold`s right hand man Jeff (Derek Thompson), attempts to keep the Americans on-board while Harold must find out who is behind the attacks and deal with them. He finally works out what is going on but can his gangster instincts deal with an entirely new threat?

Hoskins and Mirren are outstanding. They are an unlikely couple but they will have you convinced. Great acting from them both is helped by a script that gives them plenty to work with. Unfortunately, the two of them do a fine job of highlighting just how poor is the rest of the acting. Jeff has betrayed Harold but he hardly gives a hint as to what his motives might have been and all of the other characters seem to be determined to deliver their lines and collect their money and that`s it.

The uninspiring supporting actors do not detract though. The script and the editing deliver a tight package that it always moving along and holding your attention. The camera work is good too - you are there in Harold`s London and not just in a studio with a few street scene backdrops.

If you like this film then you will want to catch ""Mona Lisa"" in which Hoskins gets quite close to the Shand character. All of the subsequent Brit-gangster movies will entertain you but never reach the same level. For that, you should perhaps try ""Trainspotting"" but not if you found Hoskins` accent difficult!",1233446400,2,3018,4.7831094049904035
772156,3,6304080018,"The Long Good Friday, considered one of the best British gangster flicks, takes the classic story of hubristic downfall and sets it in late-seventies London. Bob Hoskins plays Harold Shand, a gangland kingpin trying to ""go legit"" by investing in some shorefront property which will one day host the Olympics. After a trip across the Atlantic to meet with his American gangster counterparts, he brings them back to East London where he hopes to convince them to invest with him in the shorefront property.

That's when things go wrong: his henchmen start dying and his local haunts get blown up, raising doubt in the Americans about the security of their potential investment. Harold Shand, in an interesting twist, turns from gangster to detective, and ruthlessly investigates all his known associates. Some unforgettable ultra-violence ensues, as he hangs his suspects on meat hooks, stabs his right-hand man in the throat with a broken Scotch bottle, and eventually discovers that it's all been a misunderstanding. But it's too late, and he's in over his head, against the law and against none other than the IRA. Drunk on power and a thirst for revenge, Harold Shand's arrogance finally proves to be his Achilles heel.

What's not to like about a gangster flick with a plot like this? It's also got a classic moll played by Helen Mirren, and a host of other actors who would later go on to become stars in their own right, most notably Pierce Brosnan in a non-speaking role as an IRA hitman. But the problem with The Long Good Friday is that it completely lacks style.

You can fault modern gangster movies for gratuitous stylized flourishes - most notably Ritchie's overwrought attempts - but here you have a movie that is completely lacking in any style at all. The lighting, the camerawork, and most annoyingly, an atrocious eighties synthesizer soundtrack, seem like they came straight out of an uninspired television movie. What saves The Long Good Friday are two things: Bob Hoskins' excellent incarnation of a pugnacious and racist gangster boss, saving every scene he is in, no matter how blandly directed. The other thing that saves this movie has to do with a fortuitous premonition.

This was made at the very beginning of the eighties when Margaret Thatcher came into power, ushering in, along with Reagan, the philosophy of unfettered free market liberalism. Harold Shand repeatedly refers to his gang as ""The Corporation"", and it's easy to see him as one step removed from a ruthless CEO in a legitimate corporation. Add to this the specter of terrorism, and you have a movie which resonates with anybody witnessing the 21st century. This universal quality, and some stand-out scenes make this a must-see gangster movie; but, in terms of quality filmmaking, it is nowhere near the best of the genre.

Any gangster movie will inevitably be compared to classics like Mean Streets and The Godfather, two classics from early 70s American cinema. Or perhaps British contenders from around the same time like Get Carter (which has a great soundtrack, by the way). The Long Good Friday can't hold a blowtorch to any of these. Even in terms of trashy appeal, DePalma's Scarface trounces The Long Good Friday. I could go on for days trying to pinpoint the exact point at which trashiness becomes aesthetically appealing, but I wouldn't be able to prove anything. It's just an intuition I have, which doesn't really have any logic to back it up. I can just say that close to 30 years after this movie was made, it looks and feels dated -- but it's still worth a watch, if not for Bob Hoskins' performance, than for what it portends.",1226966400,4,3639,4.881877022653722

772158,5,6304080018,"This movie is excellent from the cast of actors through the plot and the realistic brutality that is far more shocking for it's realism than many of the movie scenes that almost glorify the act of killing and the crazed manner in which people die,that is all to frequently seen in movies of this ilk.
The stone cold realism of someone being stabbed in the swimming pool shower scene, in this movie carried out by a very young Pierce Brosnan is so much more disturbing for the cold quick and mechanical taking of a life watched draining away with a simple scene of blood swirling down a drain as the victim lies dead,with only this trace of his existence left,than the wild shoot outs and incredible fire and fist power which is empty and ridiculous in so many films.
The lack of airs and graces along with a lack of pretence as to who is who and who does what is also something that marks the movie as sitting in a category with very few other films of this genre.
Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren as the principles are a suitably cold couple.
Bob Hoskins especially seems to relish the role of being the top man,and the outtakes and follow up interviews from years later are of great interest to any film lover.
They are far more interesting and revealing than many of the two hour ""lost scene,outtake"" discs that are usually the drivel that did not make it past the cut,that is why they are ""lost"" for so long,they should never be seen,as they are terrible.
I am cynical in that i do believe these discs are deliberately held back for cash ins at a later stage,to ease the viewers money away from them to see a load of not much at a bloated price.
I have not layed out the plot or said to much about the movie,more about the atmosphere,however giving things away to first time viewers is very unkind.
I would suggest that you do get this movie and enjoy it for yourself,you will soon see how far the quick and simple efficiency of action is far more memorable and frightening than so many other movies action filled with guns,weapons,hundreds of deaths etc yet ultimately empty of any resounding memories or of wanting to watch the movie again or tell your friends about it.

772159,3,6304080018,"This is a film is that is nearly great. Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren turn great performances as a gangster couple in the London of the early 1970s. Mirren in particular gave her role a take almost never seen in this sort of film. She is a competent partner of Hoskins playing something closer to the corporate wife than the old-style gangster's woman. Nothing like her performance has been seen before or since.

Where the film goes wrong is that while it develops an elaborate mystery of who is attacking Hoskins, it gives an answer that isn't all that interesting. What we get is the Irish/IRA as a kind of faceless and nameless invincible monster. They are everywhere and seem to know everything while Hoskins (and everyone else in London) doesn't even know who they are. They don't speak, are rarely visually shown and amount to little more than ciphers within the film.

Hoskins made the role interesting by seeming competent, but by the end of the film he is made out to be a total fool. It would have been a better film if the Irish had been more human or (better yet) the complexities of Irish Loyalist and Nationalist gangsterism had been used. With more political dialog and a better ending, this film would have reached the level of greatness. As it is, its very, very good but flawed.",1206835200,3,1296,4.606060606060606

772161,5,6304080018,"This film, together with Get Carter (the original) are the two finest British crime/gangster films you can get.

Bob Hoskins gives his best ever performance as Harold Shand a cockney gangster whos trying to do a deal with an American over the (as was then) wasteland of London docklands. Unfortunately while he's in the states one of his gang has upset some rather nasty people. Upon his return things start to go badly wrong.

This film is full of great scenes - perhaps most memorably when the men Harold suspects are trying to muscle in on him are brought in hanging upsidedown from meathooks - Harold has a quiet word:

""For more than ten years there's been peace - everyone to his own patch. We've all had it sweet. I've done every single one of you favours in the past - I've put money in all your pockets. I've treated you well, even when you was out of order, right? Well now there's been an eruption. It's like f**kin' Belfast on a bad night. One of my closest friends is lyin' out there in the freezer. And believe me, all of you, nobody goes home until I find out who done it, and why"".

Its all marvellously done, and the ending is very clever indeed - you will never forget it once you've seen it. The whole film is complimented by excellent music composed by Francis Monkman (who played with Curved Air and Sky).

Helen Mirren gives a great peformance as Harolds wife/girlfriend. The cast includes quite a few familiar faces such as Eddie Constantine and P H Moriarty as 'Razors'. The most noteable is a small role for the as then unknown Pierce Brosnan.

This film is also an interesting piece of British history as you can see docklands as it was before before Canary Wharf existed.

772162,4,6304080018,"""The Long Good Friday,"" (1980), made from an original script by Barrie Keefe, starring Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren, directed by John Mackenzie, makes just about everyone's short list of greatest British gangster movies.  In fact, greatest gangster movies, period.  It was nominated for a BAFTA (British Oscar) on its release.  Gangster movies are said to depend on the energy and performance of their protagonists -- see George Raft, Jimmy Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson-- and this one made a star of Hoskins, who captured the explosive violence of its protagonist Harold Shand, a cockney gangster.

The late George Harrison, of The Beatles, served, among others, as the film's Executive Producer. The film opens on Good Friday, and is, in fact, full of Easter imagery.  Shand's mother goes to mass; and scenes set in a slaughterhouse and a warehouse present specifically Christian iconography. ""The Long Good Friday"" is also set at a significant time, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's own Euro version of the greed-is-good 1980's.  In fact, at moments, it almost seems the film is quoting Dante Aleghieri's famous Italian Renaissance poem ""The Inferno,"" that also is set at Easter, and concerns the greed is good crowd of its own time and place.  At any rate, the film makes good use of its era, as Michael Caine's memorable ""Get Carter"" did of Britain's sourly swinging 1970's.

Shand appears to be on the top of the world as the film opens.  During Thatcher's reign, London's extensive docklands are just beginning to be profitably redeveloped, and he's getting in on the ground floor.  He expects to get additional seed money for his projects from Charlie, a visiting American gangster, nicely played by that iconic French actor Eddie Constantine.  Shand's got a gorgeous, upper crust, tough, sexy, smart mistress, Victoria; as played by Helen Mirren, nobody could doubt that she has her say in his organization.  But while he's in the States, hooking up with Charlie, things begin to go wrong for him.  And it takes him too long to figure out what's happening.

Pierce Brosnan, then evidently at the start of his career, has a bit, nearly non-speaking part: apparently he improvised one line, and it stuck.  But he plays a bare-chested pool scene, showing off a fine body, and a charming smile, but, oh, those terrible not-yet-improved-to-American standards teeth!  And he drives the car in the movie's gripping final scenes.  Hoskins and Mirren give remarkable performances, together and on their own, never more so than these final, almost wordless scenes together.

772259,5,6304080018,"Watching this again after several years is like experiencing an episode of Life On Mars, only vastly superior.  No need for flashbacks as we're actually there: with the clothes, the cars, the non-PC language and an undeveloped London Docklands.  A time when gangsters had (supposedly) strict rules of behaviour and decency, and worked with corrupt police officials with little danger of media exposure.  And although this is a violent, fairly realistic film, it all has a strange feeling of innocence about it. If only they knew what was around the corner!

Add to this Barrie Keeffe's marvellous script, lots of dry humour (it's almost a black comedy), Bob Hoskin's loveable villain, Helen Mirren as his upper class moll, and early appearances from Pierce Brosnan (hardly speaking, but wonderfully nasty), Gillian Taylforth and Eddie Constantine - and you have 109 minutes of pure pleasure.

The lead performances launch this film into arguably the best British gangster film ever made.  Bob Hoskins is ferocious and commanding as the sedentary king pin, Harold Shanz, and Helen Mirren redefines the role of the ganster's girl as the loyal, highly influential and intelligent wife, whose essence serves as the bridge between Harold's existence as a typical gangster, and as a civilized and powerful businessman.  What makes Bob Hoskin's performance even more noteworthy is when he wrapped up filming Zulu Dawn (1979), he became terribly sick and soon discovered a monstrous tapeworm inside him (discussed in an interview on the DVD's supplemental material), but after reading the script agreed to do the film, tape worm and all, and in the end delivers an unforgettable performance.

Shand, a powerful figure in the underworld, using politcal and law enforcement connections is at the precipice of concluding a huge real estate deal along the London waterfront.  In the entrepreneurial times spawned by the philosophies of Margaret Thatcher, Hoskins is looking to legitimize his businesses.  Advised and comforted by his cultured and level headed girlfriend Victoria played nicely by Helen Mirren, he hopes to enlist the financial backing of the American Mafia.

French cinema legend Eddie Constantine playing Charlie, the prospective American partner arrives in London to consummate the deal.  In conjunction with his arrival, the sky begins falling on Hoskins' head.  One of his chief lieutenants is knifed and another blown up in a car bomb.  When a bomb is found in a Hoskins backed casino and another explodes in one of his pubs, his American counterparts become jittery.  With the deal tottering, Hoskins, who can't imagine who could be muscling in on his turf, sends out his troops on a seek and destroy mission.

Notable in this film is the appearance of a youthful Pierce Brosnan as an IRA gunman.

772262,5,6304080018,"It's a helluva call to make but I would consider this my all time favourite gangster movie - if The Godfather trilogy is the Shakespeare of gangster films, and Scarface is the Opera of gangster films then THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY is the Dickens of Gangster films with some Jacobean tragedy overtones.  It says as much as any film about the Irish determination to wage terror in their quest for justice; it is rich in the class issues that bedevil English society; it touches on immigration issues; it understands thed power and potential for corruption in local government; it highlights the cultural cringe the UK has for Hollywod -the use of  Eddie Constantine as a visiting gangster from the USA is a master stroke - he can't get out of England fast enough, so pervasive is the violence, so dangerous is the place- he likens it to a war zone; but this also highlights another theme: as in so many things Harold (played brilliantly by Bob Hoskins) is constantly looking to the past in terms of the greatness of the ""British Empire"" and the trappings of the past - a Rolls Royce (which is blown up), the Church (to which only his ageing mother goes), and the gentry (his partner who is taken from him, played by the great Ms Helen Mirrem.

There are many highlights - Harold's temper is one such and he loses it from time to time using a broken bottle to give the face of one his lieutenants a Jacobean makeover, but the final minutes when the camera rests on his face as he is unexpectedly driven off into the night by the Irish and we read in his silent face the surprise, anger, rage, dawning realisation of his fate, acceptance, and defiance all flashing across his features, we see cinema acting at its very finest.  Not a moment that should be cut in this film. And how many films can we say that about?

It is seldom that a video company can release a film that surpasses a Criterion edition but Anchor Bay has done it. Its version totally eclipses the earlier Criterion release. And at half the price to boot.

Some commentators have placed The Long Good Friday at the same level as The Godfather and Scarface. Personally I wouldn't go that far, but it is a superb movie. Made in 1979, it stars Rob Hoskins in probably the role of his life, as London Mob Kingpin Harold Shand and a young Helen Mirren as his wife. It also stars the even younger Pierce Brosnan in his first film role, as an IRA hitman out to get them. The story is straightforward enough. After subduing all his rivals and establishing himself as king of the London underworld, Shand is set on expanding his empire by tying up with the American mob. On the day he is to seal the deal with his American investors, his lieutenants are killed one by one, his properties across London are bombed. Unknown to him, his underlings have been quietly dealing with the IRA for their own ends. Unfortunately, a mistake leads to the deaths of several IRA operatives and the organisation is out for revenge. It is a violent movie but the violence is implied rather than explicit. Some unforgettable scenes include the one with the rival bosses being strung up on meathooks at the abbatoir as Shand questions them, another where one of Shand's men is left crucified on a garage floor, and of course, the final extended closeup on Shand's face as he contemplates his fate at the hands of a smiling Pierce Brosnan.

Anchor Bay has restored the picture beautifully with hardly a speck of dirt to be seen, the image looking sharp with just the slightest amount of film grain, colors vibrant and black levels deep and rich. It is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.77:1 with anamorphic enhancement. The audio too has been restored, though it is still essentially monophonic. The dialogue is much clearer now, clear enough to decipher the Cockney dialect. Unfortunately Anchor Bay has followed tradition by not including subtitles on this DVD. Video companies should know by now that for many Americans, Cockney is about as intelligible as a foreign language. Anchor Bay obviously knows this because it includes a long A-Z Cockney dictionary on its DVD but it would have done better with optional subtitles. Apart from the new feature length commentary by director John Mackenzie, there is a 54 minute long featurette ""Bloody Business: The Making of The Long Good Friday,"" the US and UK trailers, Talent Bios, a Posters and Stills Gallery, the Cockney Glossary, the complete screenplay in Adobe Acrobat format, and an illustred 8-page booklet featuring an article on the movie.

I see that a list of Cockney slang definitions is offered on this DVD, but for a film like the Long Good Friday such a list should be offered as a supplement to optional subtitles, not as a substitute for them. To compress the rich colloquial language of The Long Good Friday into subtitles would be quite a challenge, but it wouldn't be impossible.

The Long Good Friday is a film millions of people (including me) consider to be the greatest gangster film ever made.

Given the films structure the viewer is in the same riole as Hoskins, piecing together information to make sense of events and uncover who is creating merry hell.

My Idea of a Mob boss, is not somebody who cries on his wife's shoulder after whacking one of his cronies in the head with a bottle and then thrusting the business end of the broken bottle  into his throat. The reason behind this action of course was the said crony was one of the people responsible for causing his organization to tailspin right at the critical point of the organizations development. I don't recall Al Capone crying after he smashed in his associates head with a baseball bat at one of his board meetings.

 I will say the first 60% of the movie was quite good especially the scene in the meat locker,  or let me say the beginning of that scene. After that the movie seemed to lose direction precisely when it should have gained it, since your kept pretty much in the dark up to this point.

The ending was pretty good, with the exceptions of ""the Americans"" whose accent was horrendous and quite un American, and also another example of weak underworld figures. The one thing that became evident at the very end however, is that the story should have been about the Irish Mobsters as opposed to their English counter parts.

 If this is the English version of a Mobster, I will be organizing my own crime syndicate

starting tomorrow, I will need several raw recruits, no experience necessary other than

through knowledge of  ""Good fellows"", ""Casino"", ""Scar face"" and  throw in ""the Godfather"" for good measure.

Come equipped with a tire iron, cigarettes, a healthy apatite for the top quality English Ales

and a blade in case we attend a soccer match and have a run in with some soccer hooligans.

I will give ""layer cake"" a shot but if I could suggest one for others to see, I would go with ""infernal affairs"", good story, good plot twists and ruthless criminals, also that DVD has

subtitles so you will have no problem understanding what is going on or what is being said, which is another thing that ""the Long Good Friday"" DVD was also lacking.

I apologize if I have no appreciation for the director who did this work or if it was one of

his few ventures in the English language, I just did not care that much for it, and believe me

I wanted to enjoy it.",1136851200,4,2411,4.532407407407407
772300,4,6304080018,"I ordered this film for our collection because it is a) British, b) showcases character actors in leading roles, and c) is one of the few movies Eddie Constantine made in English.

The film follows Bob Hoskins' character, a Brit mob boss who has worked his way up the ranks, through the course of what is ultimately his demise.  Helen Mirren is his mistress - her character has the thankless job of trying to help Hoskins maintain some semblance of self-control.  Constantine plays an American mob boss who is in negotiations with Hoskins on a business deal.

We found the film a dark but fascinating character study.  The whole cast is superb.  I took one mark off for the sometimes hard-to-follow dialect accents.  (They aren't as bad as the ones in say, ""Godsford Park,"" but it can make for some hard slogging.)

This is NOT a mainstream film, nor will it excite those who are used to major special effects.  However, if you are looking for something well-crafted and in depth, give this one a try.",1129852800,2,1001,4.642045454545454

Also the one negative in the movie was the American actor Eddie Constantine who plays the mafioso ""Charlie."" He played him almost as if he was a higher class of bookie. Speaking of actors besides Bob Hoskins, Derek Thompson (who played 'Jeff') was particularly good. I also caught this coincidence - the pimp in Brixton was named ""Errol"" and the night watchman towards the end of the movie was named ""Flynn."" The final scene in which Bob Hoskins is in the car with Pierce Brosnan in the front seat holding a gun on him with Francis Monkman's score playing, is a classic and must have taken many days to film just right.",1127174400,4,845,4.565789473684211

The worst part is that in the extras in an interview with Bob Hoskins and Barrie O'Keefe,Hoskins tells of how horrified he was on first seeing the original version released by the American studio and how they had dubbed his own voice to make him sound like 'a Geordie'(thats someone from Newcastle for any Americans who may be reading ).He was so outraged he threatened to sue the company.

Surely it's the most dazzling display of an actor's craft to hold in close facial shot for a prolonged time showing a variety of emotions cross the features? Hoskins does this to perfection, showing (at least) disbelief, anger, realization, fear, grim amusement and acceptance over a 90 second period, all the while set to pounding soundtrack and flickering lighting from passing streetlamps.

agro: agravation, trouble
bottle: nerve
boozer: bar/pub
wanker: masturbator
gob: (as a verb) to spit
nancy boy: homosexual
Non-slang:
abattoir: meat-packing plant
Special Branch: governmental unit responsible for dealing specifically with (among other things) ""the Irish problem.""
There are a bunch of other Cockney words as well and lots of glottal stops, but for the most part you're able to understand the dialogue that really matters. Yes, subtitles would probably help. It's an unfamiliar dialect and you need to tune your ear. (Actually, compared to real Cockney, it's pretty easily understood.) In fact, when I watched it again last night, I specifically paid attention to how much of the dialogue I understood and realized I was missing 1/3 to 1/2. And I could still figure out what was going on.
And this is definitely a film worth watching over and over and over again. The plot is, well, ""twisty"" only begins to describe it. In fact, this is one of those films in which you're put very much in the position of the hero. Little facts are revealed to you in seemingly inconsequential order. Like a jigsaw puzzle, it starts by working around the edges, and then working its way to the center. Because you generally know only what our hero, Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins in a masterfully controlled performance) knows, you are as astonished as he is when the truth is finally revealed. (In fact, The Long Good Friday presages much of what you experience in Memento, but it's the better film.)
What all this means is that you have to be patient with it. In the beginning, you're shown a series of apparently random scenes. Then, gradually, the whole comes together and the previous scenes suddenly make sense. It may be this gradual development of the story that makes this film so much fun to watch over and over again. I've now seen it twice in the past week and will probably sit down and watch it again in the next few days.
Yes, it's tough, it's violent, it's very, very complicated. Which is, of course, what makes it so much fun. (And let's not forget the brilliantly jangling musical score, reminiscent of The Third Man's famous zither.) If you're looking for arty capers like The Thomas Crowne Affair (either version), or witty elegant capers like To Catch a Thief or How to Steal a Million, look elsewhere. But if you like, say, The Killing, or the Godfather trilogy, this one might be right up your alley. Just don't go down it alone.",1057190400,8,2553,4.791383219954649

The English actors playing the parts of Americans are rather amusing.  They don't quite get the accents right.  Hoskins' scene at the end when he lectures the Americans is particularly funny, because no American would actually have any idea what he was saying.  It all seems like a skit on Saturday Night Live.

I had much difficulty understanding the mostly ""cockney"" English, doubly difficult due to significant audio distortion at most all audio levels!  If it weren't for the fact that the story is so absorbing, and I am a big fan of Bob Hoskins, I probably would not have been able to sustain an interest to watch the DVD through to the end.  But I did!  However, I have to watch it at least one more time to catch all the dialogue I missed the first time!!!  Also, although the picture quality was mostly decent, the DVD contained many white splotches (original film deterioration?) that most likely could and should have been cleaned up with more attention by Criterion, especially since Criterion provided NO extras (except for a couple of trailers) with this edition.  Why are Criterion's prices so high for bare minimum and, in this case, average technical quality DVDs?  Objections aside, this is an intriguing ganster flick!",1008028800,35,1227,4.745283018867925

Shand, one of London's leading gangsters, is trying to build up a legitimate business empire, and needs the clout of the cosa nostra to get his project of the ground. But when his investors arrive on Good Friday, what Harold thought would be a day of uninterrupted business dealings turns into a nightmare of carnage where Harold comes up against an enemy threatening to destroy the empire he has built.
 The Long Good Friday is a bombastic British gangster movie, full of memorable scenes and dialogue, and a barnstorming central performance from Hoskins. It is a classic tale of betrayal, of the old order of Shand's close knit organisation challenged by a new, ruthlessly efficient adversary, and a perfect comment on Thatcherite imperialism. And it has a pay-off to die for. In the final scene, Hoskins gives one of the best non-speaking performances of all time.

Hoskins, anxious to go legit with a multi-billion-pound Thameside development deal, is suddenly bedeviled by acts of terrorism against his organization; in a jigsaw-puzzle style that leaves the audience as much in the dark as Hoskins, but which finally becomes plain with ferocious clarity, the identity and motives of Hoskins' attackers are revealed. ""The Long Good Friday"" is a marvel of good acting, witty dialogue and kinetic energy, helped by a propulsive music score and photography that manages to be both gritty and lyrical.

Bob Hoskins is outstanding as London mob boss, Harold Shand...masterminding a major construction development along the river Thames that will nett him, and his American backers, millions of pounds. Shand has everyone on his payroll...politicians, police and enforcers...but then suddenly everything starts to unravel, and Harolds world turns upside down in the space of a day. MacKenzie's film moves with intent and purpose and Barrie O'Keeffe's screenplay keeps the suspense at a finely tuned pitch. A terrific support cast headed by the sulrty Helen Mirren as Harold's wife, Victoria....Derek Thompson as the cowardly, opportunist Jeff....P.H. Moriarty as the aptly named bodyguard ""Razors""....and Bryan Marshall as the drunken councillor, Harris, further contribute to the success of this challenging film.
Clever use of authentic London locations and creative cinematography lend a further hand to enhance the claustraphobic atmoshpere closing in upon Harold Shand and his crew...the viewer really feels through Hoskins emotional range, the unnerving pressure that is causing him to come apart at the seams. Excellent transfer to DVD...sound and color both superb...it's a pity that Criterion didn't add a few extra goodies that they usually package with their fine presentations.
A solidly crafted, gripping film with A grade performances by a splendid English cast...and keep your eyes open for a very youthful Pierce Brosnan in a minor role.
FOOTNOTE : MacKenzie also made another powerful movie three years prior in 1979 called ""A Sense of Freedom""...based on the true story of Glasgow gangster, Jimmy Boyle, and his life in jail and out.

I don't know if it's the  idea of the IRA bombing London pubs which is too close to home, or  maybe  the fact that the likeable cockney gangland  boss is also capable of  killing someone with his bare hands in a fit of rage. Either way, it is  nevertheless a brilliant film; however I cannot agree with it's description  as the best ever British gangster film, for me that will always be  ""Get Carter"". That said, there are many parallels between the two  films, the most obvious being that they both visually document an area of  England immediately prior to it's re-development. In the case of ""Get  Carter"" it is the city of Newcastle. In ""The Long Good  Friday"" it is the London Docklands. Harold Shand's ideas for  redevelopment,  although essentially criminal, are a precursor to the  actual renovations that would see redundant wharves transformed into  riverside apartments for the upwardly mobile eighties professional. He has  a real desire to use Mafia money to bring some culture into the  area...""A little bit more than a hot dog...Know what I mean?"".  Arguably the most famous scene is the five minute closing shot which starts  at the Savoy Hotel and fades into the end credits leaving the viewer to  ponder on the film's conclusion. The Non-Anamorphic picture on the  Criterion DVD is nontheless excellent.

772446,5,6304080018,"If I'm very enthusiastic about THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY, I'm forced to admit that two trailers as extra features don't deserve a loud applause. Even from a Criterion point of view. Anyway, sound and audio are very well  treated as always in this collection and I strongly recommend this  investment to any movie lover.
Hollywood gangsters movies, since the  thirties, have described the rise and fall of a great number of Scarface  look-alike. Generally, the first third of the movie exposed the hero's  childhood and his fights to become the boss, the second third exposed his  struggle to stay the boss and the last third his irresistible fall.
John  Mackenzie chose with THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY to present the last 36 hours of a  London mobster. We suppose that he has killed a lot of rivals to become  what he is now but that's not the movie's point and Mackenzie hardly gives  us any explanation about Bob Hoskins' past. He's the boss since ten years  and everything seems allright. He's part of the establishment and cannot  understand what's happening when his men are murdered.
Apart of the  extraordinary performance of Bob Hoskins in an Al Capone role, what's  terrific in THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY is the way Mackenzie describes this  mobster's ending. Bob Hoskins literally explodes in his taylor made suit,  he's a beast which doesn't understand what's going on and becomes enraged.  You have to see him committing murder and hear his bestial shout.
It's  also a movie about morals and ethic. What upsets the most Bob Hoskins, it's  not the murders in themselves but the fact that they are committed in front  of a church or in a swimming pool. His opponents just don't play by the  rules. Shame on them.
NB: look for Pierce Brosnan in the role of an irish  killer and for the great photography of London.
