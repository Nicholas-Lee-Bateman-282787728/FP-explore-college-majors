8482910,4,B005Q44344,"Considered to be ""The BEST"" of the various movie company reviews...BUT...not in my opinion.  Don't take me wrong as it is a GOOD and ENJOYABLE vaudeville comedy/song & dance vehicle of the period.  ""Hollywood Review"" (M-G-M) and ""Show of Shows"" (WB) have a lot more memorable songs and moments.  Still ""P-O-P"" is a must have to complete the set.",1414454400,,345,4.813559322033898
8482911,1,B005Q44344,"The movie itself is a great piece of history and entertainment, but the hack job done on the digital transfer should be a punishable crime. Whoever did it completely disregarded the original aspect ratio and cropped off the top of the film in order to make it widescreen. What a shame.",1410566400,2,285,4.607843137254902
