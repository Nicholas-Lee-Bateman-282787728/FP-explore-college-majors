8006803,4,B00015HVWE,"For what it's worth, Gut Pile is a simple, low budget horror flick that is able to use its resources effectively. There isn't much to the story other than a hunter killing somebody accidentally, and then he comes back from the dead to get revenge on the man and his friends a year later. There is a creepy, isolated atmosphere to the film, and the acting is good for a production like this. Many people bring up Evil Dead when talking about this film, and the similarities in camera work, setting, and situations are striking. I feel it has enough to work on its own though. There are some cool gore scenes here and there, but it's not a full on splatterfest. All in all, it's great popcorn entertainment. It's not even an hour long, so if these kinds of flicks are up your alley, it's worth checking out.",1509667200,,805,4.409395973154362

8006805,3,B00015HVWE,"This is an extremely cheap shot-on-VHS independent horror flick that copies THE EVIL DEAD with its POV camera shots with that unseen force moving through the woods. The simple plot is about a hunter who accidently shoots someone and buries the body which results in the spirit rising and entering a nearby scarecrow. That guy returns later with a couple of his buddies for a vacation in a cabin that's near the scene of his crime, and now the ghost wants his revenge. The body count is limited and only has that guy being killed by the hunter, and the scarecrow or spirit gets a couple of those guys. There's some spurting blood from the beginning scene when he's shot, and the scarcrow chops a guy up off-screen; and you see his body parts flying around. Another man is found dead with his guts hanging out near the end, and the half-human scarecrow monster looks pretty good for a film that's so cheap. The movie has some pretty good music at times, like near the end when you finally see the scarecrow. There's no nudity, and there's those POV EVIL DEAD camera movements with the scarecrow or ghost moving through the forest. The acting is basically what you would expect from a VHS home movie, but the directing is pretty good. The atmosphere and woodland scenery are decent, and the film is short with a decent pace. It's not a bad flick for an ultra-cheap VHS movie, and the gore effects are acceptable for the movies extremely cheap budget; however, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are used to seeing a lot of these cheap VHS horror flicks.

It's an extremely cheap VHS movie, so the quality is about what you would expect. The sharpness is OK, but it's a mess in many places with lots of color bleeding. The short film STUMPED has no gore or nudity, and the short flick I'VE KILLED BEFORE has some gore and is a much better flick with decent directing and some good suspense.",1376784000,,1886,4.530791788856305
8006806,5,B00015HVWE,"There's always love when I watch an Evil Dead knock-off even if it is a shot-on-video flick.  If you can sit through a Polonia Brothers flick and enjoy it, well then this is for you my friend!  I'm too nice when it comes to judging horror movies so I'm not sure you wanna take my advise haha.  Give 'Gut Pile' a chance and then later, you can beat me up haha.",1259020800,,359,4.028169014084507

  GUT PILE is the lowest-budget movie I've ever seen.  It makes me think we should have a new category - the no-budget picture.  According to the `making of' feature bundled on this dvd, the film makers were having problems coming up with the $100 per roll of 16-mm film.  I guess we have improvements in video camera technology to thank for this.
  Those involved in the making of GUT PILE make for a short list; I believe the highest number of folks on the `set' at any time was five, and the usual number was two. During the week they worked their real jobs, and shot this one on weekends and vacations. So, pick five people at random and how many of them do you suppose are brilliant actors, or editors, or writers, or directors?
 There are some interesting camera angles and editing here.  If you're a gore fan (I'm not) some of the special effects are passable.  Sub Rosa, who distributed this dvd, included a half-dozen or so trailers for other dvds on their roster, and they all seem to be similar slasher/gore fests.  Yawn.  I think once is more than enough for me in this genre.  I haven't got the heart to give GUT PILE one-star, but I'd strongly recommend you think twice before opting for this no-budget EVIL DEAD rip-off.",1089676800,2,1413,4.490196078431373
