7874174,5,6304557892,"The story line like many karate movie is always about revenge, but I love how this story explained the event leading up to the revenge and the fighting skill was much better than these lately made movie with the same fight routine. I believe any kickers fan will enjoy, I have absolutely no idea why anyone would give it a (1) star.",1506470400,,332,4.370967741935484
7874175,1,6304557892,"Despite having been inducted into the Kung Fu Hall of Fame, not all Carter Wong movies are made equal, with this one featuring a young Carter Wong being pitted against several nemesis, one of whom constitutes a young Samo Hung, both of whom have not developed their martial arts skill to their fullest and, thus, failing to live up to expectations in a wushu film that does not showcae them at their best.

If you're searching for the best Samo Hung movie, go watch Odd Couple; and as for Carter Wong, Born Invincible - both of which are cult classics that are considered martial arts essentials for any kung fu fan.",1409961600,,616,4.54954954954955
7874176,4,6304557892,"I think the other reviewers have covered this film in good detail.  The cinematography and music give the film an epic look, the deaths are overly dramatic in slow motion, the subtitles are burned in, and the fighting is decent but not the entire  point.  Personally, I like the story and the acting.  Polly Shang Kuan looks good and Carter Wong brutalizes thugs. There are some weaker fights but the action between Polly and Carter is good and the death match between Carter and Sammo is good.  As mentioned in other reviews, the fighting is mostly hand-to-hand (I saw about 3 kicks during the entire movie). The picture is very nice but not perfect, some scenes are a bit dark, and it is widescreen.

I just wanted to let people know that you can get this at a good price in a double feature two-disc DVD with ""Wu Tang Swordsman"" included.  I got the same Xenon discs as the single releases.  ""Wu Tang Swordsman"" stars Carter Wong as well and is fullscreen and dubbed.  It's not in the same class as ""Shaolin Traitorous"" but hey, the double set is currently cheaper than either single DVD if you buy it new from some Amazon sellers.",1301097600,,1134,4.519607843137255
7874177,4,6304557892,"This is one of those movies that gives off the vibe that it has just as many positives as negatives, but gets you to watch it again anyway and you cannot figure out why right away.

As someone else mentions in their review, not only are their subtitles, but they are white and fade during certain scenes in the movie. Once more, they are poorly translated.

However, the storyline of the movie just seems to be put together well and the carrying out of the storyline all the same.

One particular aspect of the movie that jumped out to me was the theme music. Some of the characters have flashbacks during the movie and the music that plays during them just has such a presence about it. The same music plays during the death of the vast majority of characters.

When they combine that music, with the flashback effect that is seen throughout the movie, and the focus on the bracelet of one particular character as she is falling to the ground and to her death(Don't want to spoil it for you) is just purely cinematic. I cannot find any other way to describe it.

This is a movie that I recommend purchasing.  In my case, the subtitles were so poorly done, I just figured enough to determine what was going on and now I watch it without paying any mind to the subtitles.",1215734400,,1270,4.405982905982906
7874178,1,6304557892,"i have a xenon release of this, that is not in english(like the product details state), instead, it is hardsubbed, meaning that the subtitles are in the actual video. it has both chinese and horribly translated english at the same time. the worst part is that the subtitles are completely white, no outlining at all, so if the screen is white or even sort of light, you can't read them. 2 thumbs down!!!",1183766400,3,403,4.534246575342466
7874179,4,6304557892,"I though this flick really high-lighted the brilliant performance by the great Carter Wong,,,I though this flick was truly entertaining and a pleasure to watch.  A fantastic addition for the collection.....the choreography and cinematography well placed, and nicely put together!!

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,,I noticed Sammo Hung's name as part of the cast (Staring0,,I did not see him anywhere in this movie, perhaps an over-sight on my part,,but I'm confident if he existed in the flick,I would have noticed him,,as he's one of my favourite old school performer.  Needless to say, Sammo Hung not bein g the most transparent, did not take anything away from this old school kicker,,you will be entertained!!",1152489600,3,711,5.219298245614035
7874180,4,6304557892,"Shaolin Traitorous is a well made film with a very good cast. The main characters in the film are played by Carter Wong, Polly Shang Kwan, Chang Yi, and Sammo Hung. Their fight scenes are very well done, and their acting in this film is also very good. This is one of the better films that Polly Shang Kwan has starred in, and she stands out as one of the better actors and martial artists in the film. The film's cinematography is excellent, especially in the outdoor scenes, and this high quality widescreen version lets the viewer enjoy it.
 The plot consists of a young boy (Carter Wong) who sees his family killed by government officials (Chang Yi & Sammo Hung). The boy enters the Shaolin Temple to learn kungfu in order to get revenge, and when he is grown up, he sets out to do so. Polly Shang Kwan plays the adopted daughter of Chang Yi's character.
 The fight scenes were well choreographed, especially Carter Wong's and Polly Shang Kwan's, and well executed also. These two actors were very good in this film. Sammo Hung is very young in this film, and one of the highlights of the film is a weapons fight in the mountains in the middle of the film, between him and Carter Wong. The fight scenes, like the rest of the film, were filmed very well, using a mix of hand held camera and tripod shots, and also a mix of close ups and long shots, and nothing ever went out of the frame. The sets as well as the outdoor settings were very good, giving the film an excellent backdrop. The only things I didn not like about the film were the corny fighting formations of the villain's hechmen, and the overly dramatic deaths. I would say this is a generally well made film, and this is a high quality VHS version.",1042156800,4,1715,4.389937106918239
7874181,4,6304557892,"SHAOLIN TRAITOROUS (aka TRAITOROUS, 1976) is a well-produced kung fu film with excellent cinematography, location filming in Taiwan, clever fight choreography and a top-notch cast. Carter Wong (BORN INVINCIBLE) and Polly Shang Kwan (LADY WUTANG) play the hero and heroine while the villains are portrayed by Chang Yi (EAGLE'S CLAW) and a future star-director of the genre, Sammo Hung (MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER).
The plot is a standard revenge tale told in a concise manner that involves a boy witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of corrupt officials and growing up to achieve vengeance. The boy goes to Shaolin Temple to learn kung fu in a superb training sequence that ranks with some of the better-known Shaolin Temple scenes in kung fu cinema. By the time the boy has completed his training, he has grown up to be Carter Wong and soon sets out on his mission. He meets Polly Shang Kwan along the way and, after some initial antagonism, the two become allies and confront the villains.
The bad guys employ a particularly clever maneuver involving dozens of imperial guardsmen performing a variety of formations on cue (including standing on each other's shoulders, three men high) as Sammo Hung bangs out different drumbeats. Sammo and Carter engage in a particularly exciting bout against the backdrop of a mountainous landscape midway through the film.
The surprisingly high-quality VHS edition offers a pristine letter-boxed transfer in its original language (Mandarin) with English subtitles.",1002585600,4,1501,5.232365145228216
7874182,3,6304557892,"Carter Wong, Samo Hung, and a star studded martial arts cast added with a  great story line full of hate , revenge, and lies. The only thing wrong  with the movies was the fight scenes. A little to choppy, and the flow was  not what you would expect from such classic stars.  A must see for fans,  but could have been much better.  Should have been.",969148800,2,349,4.212121212121212
