Pick it up, you won't be disappointed",1252195200,,226,4.463414634146342
2383051,3,B000AA4JMA,The Blue Ray is different than the DVD.  The DVD is the music plus the documentary.  The Blue Ray is music only and they left out the most awesome young horn players. I know as I am from N.O.,1243382400,4,191,3.871794871794872
2383052,5,B000AA4JMA,"I rented this from Netflix last week and liked it so much I had to buy it.  Very well documented and covered many great NOLA musicians. I was wondering why I had never heard of it, but then realized that on the realease date, we were a little busy with a couple of hurricanes. It was so nice to see the Sanger Theater still in its glory.  Hopefully the ""Broadway South"" credits will get it up and running again because it was a beauty.",1234915200,,435,4.166666666666667
2383053,5,B000AA4JMA,"I agree with the other reviewers, this is some great stuff. You get a documentary of New Orleans music, or you can just play the concert without the documentary. Its a great dvd!!! This DVD features some of New Orleans greatest musicians, too numerous to name, it also includes Bonnie Raitt, and Keith Richards. Like another reviewer pointed out buy it, even if you don't like New Orleans Funk, buy it anyway, because when you watch it then you'll like it and become a fan also.",1234051200,,478,4.569767441860465
2383054,5,B000AA4JMA,"I was fortunate enough to grow up in an era that new and different music was king, while at the same time some of the best popular music was being produced. All this took was switching from AM to FM radio. Because of this, my ears always seek new music that feeds the mind and rocks the soul. I was familiar with the New Orleans sound, but not enough to really get into it.
Well, this DVD open my ears and educated me of how influential this music scene really is. The music just covers so much territory and crosses the boundaries of every known style of music. The musicians, are top shelf, kicking it really hard and having a blast doing it. It is hard not shake ""dat ding""  while watching these guys get down. The narration is superb that explains the roots of the music and than injects the live performances to further the point. A very well done DVD and well worth the purchase price. If you love music or better yet a musician, you owe yourself to buy the DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-It-Funky/dp/B000AA4JMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make It Funky!</a>",1210464000,4,1111,4.878306878306878
2383055,5,B000AA4JMA,One of the few videos that pays tribute to the musicians of this great form. Thoroughly enjoyable !!!!,1207440000,2,102,4.722222222222222
2383056,5,B000AA4JMA,"This DVD was awesome.  I discovered the program while channel surfing, and it was so good, I bought TWO copies.  The DVD is even better, because it gives you the option of seeing the entire documentary or you can watch just the amazing concert.  The explanations of the history of the New Orleans sound was so clear and fascinating.  If you love New Orleans Blues, buy this.  You'll love it.  If you don't know anything about New Orleans Blues, buy this.  You'll learn so much. If you don't like New Orleans Blues, buy this anyway -- you'll change your mind!!",1185235200,12,559,4.53
2383057,5,B000AA4JMA,"I rented this DVD on a whim... and was BLOWN AWAY !!

I like to think of myself as a bit of a musicologist, from Chicago blues to Stax R&B to that unique amalgam of styles called N'orleans jazz. The performances on this DVD concert-documentary are nothing short of stellar. The Joint is Jumpin'!!

The documentary sections will remind the viewer of the critical importance of New Orleans in the history of American music. It will also demonstrate that the heart and soul of NOLA is still alive (if not entirely well) in the aftermath of Katrina.

This DVD is a party on-film... Rent it, buy it, DIG IT !!",1181260800,7,604,4.472727272727273
2383078,5,B000AA4JMA,"Great music and history of New Orleans music. (A Great and Good friend is an backup singer, Irene Sage who is an NOLA star in her on rite)",1376006400,,138,3.9642857142857144
2383079,5,B000AA4JMA,What entertainment! It is both educational as well as a documentation of New Orleans music. It is well worth having my CD/DVD collection.,1364860800,,137,5.0

2383084,5,B000AA4JMA,"Oddly enough, this disc is floating around ""cheapie"" stores for two dollars. It is a great presentation of New Orleans music and culture.

What I like very much about it is that it was based around a concert event on Aug. 28th 2004 - the same weekend a year earlier than when Katrina hit.
That said, it is purely a celebration of New Orleans music and culture/history without the baggage of Katrina.
New Orleans has come back and continues to thrive, but any documentary post-Katrina can't help but show the scars. This film is pure New Orleans in all of it's FUNKY beauty!

Excellent music, great archival footage of the Mardi Gras Indians and the origins of the Mardi Gras parades. I watch it every year on Mardi Gras day.

Buy it, get yer Ya Yas out (to quote Rolling Stones) and party your A$$ off!",1269216000,2,802,4.47945205479452

2383086,5,B000AA4JMA,"This is an excellent DVD for who that does like jazz and R&B. It is a perfect story about New Orleans, its music and musitians. I would strongly recomend this DVD!!!",1261353600,,165,4.354838709677419
2383087,5,B000AA4JMA,"The city of New Orleans is as much a part of this music as Kermit Ruffins trumpet or George Porter Jrs bass. From Treme to the Quarter, the city breathes in second line. This film is a great introduction and tribute to some of the worlds finest music.

Be aware however that Professor Longhair appears only in film clips, as he was long dead by the time this was made, Amazon ""actors"" not withstanding. But Jon Cleary and Alan Toussaint do a great version of the Fess classic ""Tipitina"" that shouldn't be missed.

The performers here- from the Meters to Nevilles, Snooks Eaglin, Walter ""Wolfman"" Washington, to the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, are all stellar. A must see.",1258243200,2,667,4.6440677966101696

8076705,4,B000AA4JMA,Great history of the New Orleans music!  My Dad played piano when it was still illegal for black and white musicians to create music together - Circa 1930's.  I learned a lot from this film on what struggles he may have encountered.  Excellent!,1462492800,,244,4.627906976744186
8076706,5,B000AA4JMA,"Very enjoyable and entertaining, as well as educational music of historical and current New Orleans' music.  Jazz & many blended
musical productions.  Especially the piano work of some of the greatest.  Allen Touissant on piano was awesome, as were other
pianists and instrumentals, as well as Irma Thomas singing.",1462492800,,314,5.36734693877551

8076712,5,B000AA4JMA,"I enjoyed the real ""spirit in the air"" generated by the on-screen comments by the multitude of New Orleans music people. Some were entertainers some were in the music business but ALL appreciated the depth of the music. It really brought home the significance of the music from that area of the country. Unique is too simplistic a term. How about authentic, raw and emotional music that was produced and continues to have a significant influence on the music scene today.  I really LOVED the concert as well.",1381795200,,508,4.7727272727272725
8076713,4,B000AA4JMA,"okay so the headline is probably too serious, but this is a really important movie, fantastic collation of the key figures, music, and history of one of music's most important eras. This is a movie not only to watch once, but to buy, to keep, to watch again and learn from.",1377734400,,273,4.372549019607843
