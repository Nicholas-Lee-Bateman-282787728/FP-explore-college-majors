7923057,4,B00004TRD4,"Santa brought this to my 4-year-old and he loves it. He had a few Spidey toys but had never seen THE Amazing Spiderman in action. From the first note of that high energy blaring theme song he was glued to the TV like never before. Don't let reviews that dis the low budget animation keep you from getting this epic that tells the tale of how Spidey came to be. Get the original story before Hollywood does to Spidey what they did to Batman. The animation isn't a make or break like most people pretend it to be. I mean sure there is some real super looking stuff on TV these days, but kids today love Thomas the Tank Engine and Bob the builder which both make claymation look hi-tech!
The only ""disappointment"" may have been the Electro show. During the energy crisis days of the 70's this show had a little more meaning and intrigue. My son still loved it mind you, but they should have included another foe that figured a little more greatly into Spidey's webslinging heroism of the late sixties and early seventies. I highly recommend at least the Spidey video, which can be bought separate.",1010102400,9,1094,4.475

Now, after watching these, his new hero is spiderman.  I must admit, I rather enjoyed seeing these again myself.  The only problem I've had is tring to get the spiderman theme song out of my head!",1000944000,3,355,4.515625
7923059,3,B00004TRD4,"An excellent look at the vintage approach to comic book heroes.  The Mighty Thor, Sub-Mariner, and Spider-Man.  The animation is, at times, odd.  But the voices and stories are definitely timeless.",962841600,7,197,5.290322580645161
