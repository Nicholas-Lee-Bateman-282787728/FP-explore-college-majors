1666191,4,B00005UQ7A,"I just watched all four of the brave archer movies, and would like to know where's the archer in brave archer? I saw absolutely no archer or archery in any of the movies. The fighting was good, but the story lines were hard to keep up with at times. In closing I like to say that Alexander Fu Sheng and the Venoms made the movies worth watching.",1259712000,,345,4.164179104477612
1666192,5,B00005UQ7A,"No wonder ""One Armed Swordsman"" was disappointed with this movie (beyond some close-mindedness): this truncated adaptation of  Hong Kong writer Jin Yong's ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"" came from director Cheh upon finishing his run of Shaolin movies, with ""The Five Venoms"" soon to come. With that, the movie goes in reverse (sort of) as the to-be-expected Cheh chaos  leads to the love story: from dark to light, almost. Blame the source material for OAS's response! Everyone else who enjoys a break from the ""usual"" Cheh will like this work from the man himself ( by the third sequel, Cheh put the story six feet under by abandoning Fu Sheng [to an unnecessary, lesser role] and letting the ""Venoms"" run rampant). Alexander Fu Sheng fares well, aided and abetted by a supporting cast who give plausiblity to the fantasy. Among them, four soon-to-be ""Venoms"" are found: Chiang Seng (two quick walk-ons as a guy without a tongue), Lo Meng, Lu Feng and--stealing the show--Kuo Chui as ""the Pope's brother""! Yet another great Tokyo Shock DVD, from picture, sound, commentary (from Brian Camp),and a nice touch of other extras. Not a kung-fu movie; another good reason to catch this....Love, Brother Fang.",1255478400,3,1202,5.005
1666193,1,B00005UQ7A,"This movie deserves 0 stars but unfortuanitly i have to put 1 (-_-)
THIS IS NOT A KUNGFU MOVIE!!!its a Corny-Ass love story(on sum Titanic iSh)
with [...] characters,a stupid plot(that totally switches up! OMGosh the movie
starts off with a decent(martial arts)story but as soon as this guy
meets a girl EVERYTHING CHANGES!& the original story is abandoned.

1666194,5,B00005UQ7A,"I loved this movie!  It's different from most of what I've been watching lately in that it's a costume piece epic that focuses on story and character development more than mindless action.  There's still plenty of action, but in shorter bite-sized moments.  And the story isn't perfect -- basically you have a huge cast with people coming and going quickly, so there are loose ends.  I saw Shaw mega-star Ti Lung during the opening credits but I don't recall him from the movie -- I think they had to cut him out.  It's quite long by their standards.  But I enjoyed every minute and wish there was more.  So many great stars, some great comedy, and I must admit I loved the sweet love story that starts in the most unexpected way and lasts the entire rest of the movie.  I have such a huge crush on Niu Tien's character.  She was amazing!  My god I need a woman like that!

On this new Tokyo Shock dvd the picture quality is absolutely beautiful.  Language tracks are English 5.1, English mono, and Cantonese mono, along with English subtitles.  There's also a commentary track from some expert, but I never do commentary tracks, sorry.  The extras are a photo gallery and trailers, as well as a textless version of the opening credits, but I'm not sure why that's included.  You see all the major characters, but it's not like a Liu Chia-Liang action opening.",1244851200,,1360,4.56198347107438

1666196,3,B00005UQ7A,"This movie is ok. Its not great, its not spectacular, its just ok. This movie is a love story. The only thing this movie has is name recognition. The fact that this movie has the dudes who played in the venoms series doesn't make it any better. The fact that this movie was made by the Shaw Brothers doesn't change a thing! It needed more action and more killing! There was some but...not enough. If your buying this movie to collect a Shaw Bros. classic then yeah buy it for that reason but for something to watch buy something else!",1239667200,,534,4.35
1666197,4,B00005UQ7A,"This is the first of a four film series.  This widely considered the best of the four stories released in the Brave Archer series.  There are fantasticasl moments that really provide the escapism some viewers so desperately crave.  Then there are the extremely well crafted hand to hand choreographed fights eg. the fight initial between Lee Yi Min and fu Sheng is great.  Then there are touching moments eg. when Fu Sheng offers his only protection against the cold winter climate to a young beggar.  The fantastical, with Fan Mei Sheng as snake lord, and the blind witch who is justifiably feared by ALMOST everyone.  Peach Blossom Forest is a tribute to true escapism and the three fingered drunken monk played by the immortal, Ku Feng is perfect.  You actually sense the air of respect the duo have for him through fear of uncertainty.  This is a wonderful film and a must have for any self respecting kung fu fan.",1230076800,11,918,4.69375
1666198,3,B00005UQ7A,"I believe the movie is great,but the one I purchased was edited and too short. I would love to have the entire movie. It was so short that some of the cast were not even in the movie. Important cast members died in the movie without a scene showing their fates. The movie I purchased was a dvd.",1186531200,,294,4.086206896551724
1666199,1,B00005UQ7A,"This movie is quite lame considering the cast and crew.  It was definately recorded from tv.  You can easily see where the recorder stopped for commercials.  At one point you can almost make out the station identification at the break.  Despite the great cast the kung fu is quite bland, and the acting is hideous.  I believe the person recording this movie forgot to hit record after one of the commercials.  There is way to much important information missing when names and events are mentioned.",1018742400,6,497,4.788235294117647

1666244,1,B00005UQ7A,"I have been watching Kung Fu films since the 1970's, and this is like a bad Chinese soap opera. I am stunned at all of the ""fan boy"" suck up attitude by people reviewing this film. It was a struggle to keep up with the characters and outrid storyline. The dumb segments where the archer and his girl friend meet, separate, and meet and separate are as disjointed as a jigsaw puzzle missing important pieces. I find it hard to believe Cheh Chang and some of his Venom mob lent their considerable skills to this absolute mess of a film. And as much as I love Fu Sheng, he comes off as a brainless twit. I am selling my copy on Ebay.
Good luck to the next sucker who drinks this Kung Fu Kool aid. Not sure if I can get through Part two. Good Lord. The Emperors new Clothes? Yeah, this is that story incarnate! No one can see how bad this is because everybody else is saying how good it is! HIDEOUS! Classic? I think not! Kid with The Golden Arm blows this trash away!",1411516800,2,964,4.160427807486631

7954988,3,B00005UQ7A,"This movie is in Mandarin and has closed caption if you turn it on.  As of June 2017, this movie title showed a different movie on Amazon than the one prior to June 2017 (which you will find reviews for a different movie).  So, here is a review of the revised version.  The revised version is one of three part series, so locate the Brave Archer 2 and 3.  I think they made a mistake with the title as there is no archer in this movie.  As for this first movie, the story is about two sworn brothers who each has a wife and child.  The children were born at around the same time.  A Taoist monk who is a family friend names the two kids and offers them each a sword.  The mothers exchanges to swords, so that they have the names of the other kid.  However, the two sworn brothers were attacked by a prince's army.  One wife and her child is saved by seven kung-fu masters while the other wife and child is taken by the prince.  The kid who is raised by the seven masters has a moral compass and seems to be a good guy who attracts more kung-fu masters along the way.  The other kid raised by the prince is going around being playful and lies to his mother, and just doesn't seem to concern himself with morals.  One of the fathers was killed in the attack while the other father raised an adopted daughter.  Somehow one day, the three kids meet and the father is taken back to the prince's home as a prisoner and finds his ex-wife there.  In the end, the two brothers go their separate ways without knowing there fathers' past.  The kid with the moral compass becomes attracted to a girl of a great kung-fu master, and must pass an exam to marry the girl.  Be aware this movie doesn't have too many fight scenes, but has a decent story that continues to part 2 and 3.

This movie on Amazon was a different movie prior to June 2017:
Villain Has a Son Who is Adopted by Good Parents Who Wants Him to Be Good, But the Son Strays:
Good story about a young man who is the son of a major villain.  His father was killed by another villain, but he mistakenly believes that his adopted/god parents are the ones who killed his father after hearing this from that villain even though this villain is the actual killer of his father.  The parents who adopted him are actually the good people and their goal was to make sure that this kid grows up to be good knowing that his father turned out to be a bad guy even though he grew up along side with his god father at a monastery.  The problem with this film is the ending is very abrupt as if there is a part II to this film.  We don't know what happens to this son after the god father takes him to the same monastery that his father learned his kung-fu.  The fight scenes were well choreographed and story is good, but the ending needed work.",1492905600,,2782,4.178236397748593
