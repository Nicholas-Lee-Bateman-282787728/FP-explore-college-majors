2123533,5,B0002V7SO8,"This movie polarised reviewers. Those that wanted a Gram Parsons biopic didn't like it, because the film makers changed some details to make it work better as a movie. Those guys will be much happier with the BBC's biopic out next year.

Those that can accept that 'Grand Theft Parsons' uses one of the most famous of all rock 'n roll stories as a starting point for a terrific road movie just loved it. And I guess Amazon readers will be the same.

If you're a 'Grampire' and you want a documentary, then wait until the BBC one comes along.

If you want to kick back and watch a fun, touching and cool movie about responsibility and friendship, then I can't recommend this highly enough.",1093910400,12,688,4.488
2123534,5,B0002V7SO8,"This is my first review on here. I watch a couple of movies a week, but have never really seen the point in adding my thoughts to a long list of others. So why now?

Well, I wouldn't want you to miss this movie. It's that great!

'Grand Theft Parsons' stars Johnny Knoxville, who I don't really care for. But he's absolutely perfect here as Phil Kaufman, the man who steals Gram Parsons' body. He doesn't mug, he doesn't overact and he doesn't try too hard. But he does do this: he absolutely nails the part! And the rest of the acting is also stellar. Christina Applegate is perfect as the wronged woman, Robert Forster is the heart of the film as Gram's father, and there's a guy called Michel Shannon who might just steal the whole thing!

It's all about human loyalty, responsibility, friendship, honor and decency. It's a buddy movie, that's also a drama, that's also a thoughtful love story and a laugh out loud comedy, all with a rocking soundtrack.

My advice, for what it's worth, is to stop reading my nonsense and go buy this movie - you won't be sorry.

Five big, fat, juicy stars!",1093910400,10,1093,4.445

2123545,5,B0002V7SO8,"The movie basically outlines the historical facts of Gram Parson's death and subsequent events.  After reviewing both, the movie and historical accounts, it appears to me that a lot of the creative license that Kaufman took was probably to protect innocents, and to avoid conflicts and legal actions from some who might have been less than innocent.  Humorous dialog and situations that are not exactly accurate are probably not extremely exaggerated, in comparison to the real humor that obviously attached to an actual airport theft of the body and fireball cremation in the desert.  The only part of the movie that appears to be completely false is the role of Gram's stepfather.  Necessary politics, maybe, or money?

In some respects the historical account is more humorous.  There is the historical account that in the police chase after the fireball, Kaufman and friends got away because the police were, ""handicapped by sobriety.""  The Joshua Tree Park officials handling (or more factually, non-handling) of the site of the cremation is also interesting.

In summation, I think the movie does a good job of presenting the pathos of the actual events.  SADDENING, SICKENING AND FUNNY AS HELL.  I would also recommend that anyone interested in country or rock music history read, at least, the Wikipedia account of the actual event.  Just google Gram Parson's death.",1441584000,,1373,5.13963963963964

2123549,4,B0002V7SO8,"This has got to be one of the most overlooked films ever. The film itself is very well made and the acting is better than you might think it would be. I mean who knew Johnny Knosdviille could really act? And the highlight of this film is an inspired performance from Michael Shannon as the burn-out hippie Larry Oster-Berg. He is hilarious. Fans of Parsons will want to see it just because it's about Parsons, but there's a flip side to that coin because even if you never heard of Parsons you'll enjoy this film because the movie isn't really about Parsons as much as it is about Kaufman and his determination to honor his promise to his best friend no matter what. This line from the review on IMDB written by Anonymous sums it up perfectly a story so extraordinary that if it didn't really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times Amen to that brother.",1437782400,,972,4.435754189944134

2123574,3,B0002V7SO8,"Released in 2003, this obscure movie is based on the weird events after country rocker Gram Parsons died just shy of his 27th birthday in 1973. He and his buddy, Phil Kaufman had a pact that if one died before the other the survivor would spread the other's cremains at Joshua Tree National Monument, a place Parsons loved. A couple of months after they made the pact Parsons' died and Kaufman felt duty-bound to carry out the pledge. So he steals Gram's body from the L.A. Airport and goes to Joshua Tree to carry out his promise. Of course, the authorities catch wind of the theft and are on the case; others too.

Johnny Knoxville is a solid protagonist as Phil Kaufmen and Michael Shannon is amusing as the hippie with a flowered hearse that Kaufman hires to transport the body. Christina Applegate plays Kaufman's ex-girlfriend and Marley Shelton his current girlfriend, both joining the chase. Robert Forster plays Parsons' aloof dad who feels bad about not being closer to Gram.

This all sounds more entertaining than it actually is. There are too many dull stretches (like the overlong airport sequence), but Knoxville and Shannon play well together and Applegate is always a pleasure to behold (she has such a striking look), not to mention the authentic locations. So it's nothing great, but it's worthwhile if you like the folk rock of the late 60s/early 70s and have a taste for quirky, unique independent movies.

The film runs 88 minutes, but feels longer.

2123578,5,B0002V7SO8,"Great movie! I avoided this for years because of so many negative reviews -- lots of people HATE this film. Then I saw a few moments of it on TV.... and was mesmerized. I rented it immediately and loved it.

It is very very funny black humor, smart and well crafted, with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. And it's moving at times, too.

I don't care anything about Gram Parson's hippie dippy cowboy music, it's just not my cup of tea. But this is not a bio pic or a music pic, it's black comedy fiction very loosely and I assume very inaccurately based on real events. So if you want to learn the truth about this incident, go read a book or an article, cause this movie just uses that tale as a jumping-off point. In other words, this ain't the history channel, it's the hysterical channel.

Michael Shannon is just astonishing and hilarious as the stoned-beyond-stoned hippie Larry Oster-Berg. Shannon's performance reminds me of great screen weirdos like Crispin Glover and Steve Buscemi -- yeah, he is that good! Every moment Shannon is on the screen is wonderful, and he's in most of it.

Oh, and there are some gorgeous backgrounds here! Stark stunning desert shots, cool crumbling roadside motels and bars, and the like.

Gram Parsons die hard fans pretty much dislike this film due to the ""artistic license"" taken with the facts. I won't comment on that, I will leave that to Parsons historians and concern myself only with the film. Johnny Knoxville has never been a favorite of mine but he does a darn good job in Grand Theft Parsons as Phil Kaufman, Parsons road manager and friend and apparently, mastermind of the theft. Michael Shannon is dead on perfect as the clueless hippie, Larry Oster-berg, owner and driver of the getaway hearse. He delivers his lines with a dead pan sincerity that is pure genius. This goofy film makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it. Of course, it helps if you have a weird sense of humor to begin with. It's well worth the small price of the DVD.",1298937600,2,959,4.474285714285714
2123582,3,B0002V7SO8,"I remember seeing the ad for this movie a few years ago after I had just discoverd who Gram was and was intrigued by the story, of course. I just read all these review a couple of days ago and then got a copy and watched it yesterday, so I knew what to expect. Small indie movie without much script and suspect acting. But, hey, Christina Applegate is usually entertaining and easy on the eyes. Not a jackass fan.... Anyway, i thought it was average. Johnny Knoxville actually plays the part spot-on and the humor portrayed by him and the cast in a naturally humorous story (truly no disrespect to the deceased -- his music is absolutely fantastic in my opinion)is understated, dark and subtle. I expected a lot of stupid humor and there was just enough to make it funny, I thought. I think the opinions that trash this movie are rather wrong. It's a low budget flick to be sure, and with moderate expectations it was a rather entertaining short movie. Sure a better script and more in-depth analysis of character relationships would help. But I thought the characters were mostly believable, not to overstated or ridiculous. Christina's character is maybe the exception, but the world is full of people who act like that when they have their one chance at money. I actually thought her whole role and acting was rather hilarious. One reviewer criticized her agent for getting/allowing her this role, but I think it must have been fun and attractive to her, and she pulls off the psycho gold-digger with gleeful aplomb. She's not quite A-list, ya know. So for a change of pace from what I might usually see, this was a fun time.",1294099200,,1628,4.617241379310345
2123583,4,B0002V7SO8,"I really like this movie and have seen it several times.  Yes, it takes a LOT of license with the facts and the characters, but Phil Kaufman was involved in the making of this film, so he must have had some approval.
I'm a fan of Gram Parsons, but this movie is not about Gram.  The opening credits are great, as they show a montage of pictures of Mr. Parsons, and they go by too quickly.
THIS movie is entertaining and funny without being slapstick.  The characters are well defined and well acted, and even though the story is a little gruesome, it is portrayed in a way that just makes you smile.  The characters are exagerated, but hey, it's entertainment.  If you want to see a funny film that is not all about sex and booze jokes, see this one.",1294012800,3,750,4.290780141843972

2123595,2,B0002V7SO8,"This movie would have simply been a bad low budget move with Johnny Knoxville in it, but because it was written around a real musician, and one well-respected, it was kind of insulting.  It was pretty bad, and it unnecessarily re-wrote all sorts of detail in a very interesting historical event.  To follow what actually happened would have made a better story.  I thought that they'd quit doing  this with movies, but I guess not.  Although it wasn't based on a book, this reminded me of when they used to destroy books when they turned them into movies.

I'll watch it again, though, and try to pretent it isn't about a musician I appreciate.

A good point is that Johnny Knoxville's cousin, Roger Allen Wade (?), wrote a pretty good song for  the closing credits.",1257724800,,766,4.622222222222222
2123596,4,B0002V7SO8,"I don't know about Robert Forster, but when he's on, he's on, and when he's overworked, he acts like he's been hit over the heat with an anvil.  That's the mode we find him in as he speaks his lines as Gram Parson's father, apparently stricken by grief when his son dies of an accidental overdose of drugs in Southern California in the 1970s.  When he arrives at the airport, he discovers that his son's corpse has been commandeered by road manager Phil Kaufman (Johnny Knoxville) in a psychedelic yellow hearse, and the chase begins.  Forster can barely even pretend to be interested in this strained road farce, but such is his gravitas that for awhile, we read his pained features as the earnest and moving performance of a man doubled over by the pain of surviving one's own child.  Since the real Parsons Senior died in the 1950s, he's playing a part that didn't really exist, and something of that unreality is perhaps affecting his weightlessness here.  Jack Lemmon did it all much better in Costa-Gavras' Missing, and I don't even like Jack Lemmon, but he was risking something emotionally, whereas for Forster, the draw seems to be the next paycheck over the horizon.

Christina Applegate is playing someone fictional too, but at least she seems to have read even the other parts of the script.  But gee, Christina, all I can think of, get a new agent.  Even Marley Shelton is getting the better part in this movie, and who is Marley Shelton?  (Well, everyone knows her as the girl whose strange resemblance to Heather Graham made people think she was Heather Graham's stunt double.)  Here Shelton plays the girlfriend of Johnny Knoxville and winds up with a strange understanding of Christina Applegate's greedy gold-digger survivor.  The two women undergo a unique bonding while the grand chase is on.  And who gets to play the late Gram Parsons?  None other than Gabriel Macht--soon to leap across the world's multiplex screens as the embodiment of Will Eisner's pioneering comic super-hero The Spirit.  He's great here in a very tiny part and let's hope he does The Spirit with half of the spirit he brings to this very misbegotten, yet entertaining indie potboiler.",1228435200,4,2179,4.806970509383378

2123598,1,B0002V7SO8,"The truth at the center of this story is far more compelling than the shallow retelling here. Artistic license should yield a more substantial script at the very least.  The male leads rise above the writing, but they can only take it so far.  Why ignore the complex relationship between GP and his stepdad and Phil's reaction to that?  Isn't that where the story is?

2123599,3,B0002V7SO8,"This movie surprisingly had great cinematography, screenplay and was well carried-through by all cast members.  While it succeeds in being subtly humorous, the main plot of a corpse being transported by stolen hearse from LA to Joshua Tree, CA is perhaps too morbid to begin with, especially since it's based on the actual death of the `70's `Alternate Country Western' singer Gram Parsons, September 1973.  But overall, I believe these offbeat, low-budget, independent film-makers often present interesting stories, otherwise not available.  Unfortunately, without the budget for studio voice-overs, the audio fades in some crucial dialog points.  However, this film includes actor summaries and is well acted by the primary 3 players, Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman), Christina Applegate (Barbara) and Marley Shelton (Susie).  And it soon delivers as a true, picturesque, hippie `road-trip' style flick, which I automatically enjoy.",1189555200,3,934,5.739130434782608
2123600,2,B0002V7SO8,"I saw this movie on Cable in a motel room in Chicago and I really felt for Applegate's Character. I thought back to the time I visited Joshua Tree and about my personal relationship with a man with a serious substance abuse problem. I did stay in the Gram Parson's death room at the Joshua Tree Inn about 10 years ago, and I feel a certain connection to him in a way. When I saw this film, I just thought how terrible the woman Applegate's character is based upon must feel if she were ever to see this film. Gram Parsons basically killed himself. If you haven't lived with and loved an alcoholic or drug addict, you have no idea how this woman felt or would have reacted to his death. Of course she's going to be angry, what kind of person dies like that? He drove out to the middle of the desert and overdosed. He was alone in a hotel room, and he killed himself with substances. Sure, he was a great song writer, but come on, I'm sure he wasn't perfect, he wasn't a saint. You people don't know what it's like to fight for someone with an addiction. You people don't know what it's like to fight every day to make this person whom you love stop using drugs, stop drinking and want to live. To BLAME Applegate's character in the end, was just a low blow. Who are you to make that kind of assumption? That Parsons killed himself to get away from her? Maybe he had his own demons that Applegate's character didn't have any control over. Who are you to accuse her and that she had any influence in his death? You write this screenplay and make her responsible for his death, in the end. He killed himself. Maybe he was beating her, there are several different types of abuse, mental, physical, emotional, sexual... did you ever think of that? Maybe Applegate's character had been abused beyond her limit of tolerance.  Maybe he was too insane to live... and his death was the final blow. Death was so easy for him and he left behind a cross for her to bear.  Maybe she was just trying to save him, and after his death she had a normal reaction of anger and frustration. Even in the synopsis of this film they call her ""Betty (Applegate) the psycho exgirlfriend""...living with a drug addict makes you psycho...that's not fair. What misogynist wrote that discription? To the screenwriter... were you there? Did you witness private moments between the two of them? How dare you say she would be responsible for his suicide. Do you have any idea what it's like to pick up the pieces after something like that happens? His death was a selfish, careless, loveless act. It was his choice, in the end.  To include that line at the end, about how he did what he did to get away from Applegate's character did a disservice to all women involved with men with substance abuse problems. That line adds insult to injury. Maybe she was in for the long haul and he was a black hole and maybe she was just trying to pull herself out of the pit he dragged her into. Unless you lived her life, you have NO RIGHT to make that accusation against her. It doesn't help that he was famous and people sing his praises and basically forget that he had a substance problem. He killed himself, she had nothing to do with it... no one is defending her and the screenwriter should feel ashamed.",1183161600,,3264,4.391735537190082

If you're a Gram Parsons fan, particularly in the elderly set, this movie is likely to give you the deep blues. I was really excited to see that someone attempted to tell this weird tale of comradeship, love, and stupidity, and I hope that Phil Kaufmann earned a few bucks from it. Sadly, the movie just doesn't make it, whether as a buddy movie, as a comedy-drama, or as a tale of weirdness. The actors seem to be giving it an earnest effort, but the script is just so stiff (no pun intended) that no one could have carried it off effectively. The movie fails to shed much light on Gram Parsons, who, contrary to the film's depiction, was largely unknown to the masses at the time of his death (the Byrds' Sweetheart album was a commercial disappointment; the Burrito albums were commercial disasters; Gram's own first album was already in the cut-out bins when I bought it for $2 in early summer 1973. His death created some anticipation for his second solo album, but essentially no one bought it at the time. If you don't believe me, look at the Billboard charts, where it hardly measured in the top 200 LPs! Gram's legend would come later, thanks to large measure to Emmy Lou Harris' devotion). The film is success, however, in revealing that Parsons commanded an immense amount of respect from his friends and colleagues. One hopes that someone else tries to tackle this compelling story sometime in the future, hopefully with a better script and a stronger vision.",1138492800,6,1581,4.65

And, you shouldn't judge Johnny Knoxville because of what he has done in the past, he was cast great in this movie. The only problem I had with it was Christina Applegate, but thats cause I don't really care for her since Married with Children, she will always be known as Kelly Bundy to me.

2123615,5,B0002V7SO8,"I never write reviews on Amazon, but was shocked that everyone but the spotlight reviewer panned this film. Though I can imagine skepticism would stem from Johnny Knoxville being in a movie were he had to act (since he is most famous for the Jacka** movie and TV Show) Knoxville turned in a great performance. He seemed at ease with the character and was able to subtly convey his lines. His understated approach to the part serves to contrast the absurd situation his character is in and lends realism to the film that would be lacking if Knoxville had tried to ham it up for more laughs. The scene where he tries to rent the hearse and can barely mask his anger at the hearse's drug addled owner's incompetence had me on the floor rolling with laughter. I wasn't familiar with actor Michael Shannon before this film but he does a great job as the owner of the hearse. His cartoonish over the top hippie was the perfect Ying to Knoxville's character's reserved Yang. (a point which Shannon's character cleverly brings up.)

As if great dialogue, suburb acting, and a yellow hearse with flowers painted on the side weren't enough to make you want to see this film immediately if not sooner; the sound track alone makes the movie worth watching, it uses a lot of Parson's songs but also other great songs from the era.

 In the end this film goes beyond being a great comedy to become a great film.  Having Gram Parson's father as a character added a lot of weight to the last half hour of the film, with Robert Forester conveying all the resignation, sadness, and guilt felt by his character his downtrodden facial expressions. This is a movie I would recommend to anyone.",1119916800,14,1672,4.581939799331104
2123616,1,B0002V7SO8,"First, I loved what Gram did for music, his legacy is as strong today as it was in the begining. How his tragic death could be made into a ""black comedy"" is beyond me! how his father could be portrayed as a cold fish human, no emotion, and this druggie driver of the hurse, what an insult! What this movie should have been is a telling of Gram's life UP to his death!, and then quickly work in the ""burning"", all this bitching and fussing, lying and chasing, come on!,what an insult to a man's mark left on the music world, This mans life burned at a pace few of us can comprehend!

2123617,2,B0002V7SO8,"Well, here's the perspective of an old Byrds fan....  For what it's worth, I once had the good fortune to see the Parsons/ Hillman Burritos deliver a scorchingly hot unforgettable set at a private Hollywood party shortly after their first album.  And  have never forgotten Rolling Stone's extraordinary  investigative reporting piece, senselessly tragic and absurdly comic, relating the full story of Parsons' demise -- with details far more jaw dropping than anything here.  (And touching things, like the Byrds playing a series of gigs around the San Fernando valley to raise money for Kaufman's legal defense, each set including the ghoulish oldie ""Monster Mash"".)

This is a truly bizarre chapter in the history of California folk and country rock, and I direct anyone interested to the Rolling Stone archives.  It is also the stuff of a great if  bizarre film -- which maybe someone will see in a hundred years or so.  But while certain people are still living, I would imagine just the legal clearances necessary for an honest telling are daunting.  What is also required is unflinchingly honest story telling courage -- which is here missing in spades.

Basically I have to say the actors, director, writing, and striking desert photography in this film are pretty much up to snuff most of the time.  So They had the talent in place to deliver an honest picture...  Gram's music, though skimpy, is also good...  It's just that they skipped the real story and substituted a wholly imaginary and inoffensive formula yarn.

This fictional concoction misfires from the start: news of Parsons' unexpected death has minimal impact on his longtime roadie Phil Kaufman.  The man scarcely misses a beat; it's pretty much, ""Oh man, we made that pact over beers, so I've gotta go get his body"" -- almost as casual as picking up someone's luggage at the airport.  This lack of emotional substance, whether humorous or sober, sets the tone for a film that feels increasingly shallow, forced, and insincere.

And if my memory serves, after Kaufman and his hippie pal snatched Parson's body from LAX, the drive to Joshua Tree was pretty much without incident.

Yet that trip is the focus of this film, filled with mostly bogus events in an imaginary story that slides from silly to goofy.  Parsons' girl friend chases them across the desert because she can't collect Gram's fortune until someone identifies the body for a death certificate (but San Bernadino County would not have shipped an unidentified corpse with no death certificate to New Orleans); somehow Kaufman's girl friend tags along with her to ""save"" Kaufman, though the girls dislike each other.  Meanwhile Gram's stepfather witnessed the body snatching from his airplane window seat on the runway, so without notifying police he grabs a car and also gives chase.  The California Highway Patrol somehow gets wind of this anyway and is thrown into the mix, on the lookout for the ""hippie hearse"".

What follows is a watered down version of Burt Reynolds' old ""Cannonball Run"" movies.

Simply put, I would hate to have this movie on my conscience.",1114300800,8,3102,4.978640776699029

In fact, I'm not sure if some of the reviewers have actually seem the film. FYI, the guy with the beard is Phil Kaufman - Gram (seen in a dream sequence) actually doesn't have a beard in 'Grand Theft Parsons'.

I have no great interest in Gram Parsons, and I bought this DVD because it looked like it might be a lot of fun and I'd read some great reviews in the press. I'm happy with my choice, and thoroughly enjoyed the film, which I found amusing, touching and really well told.

I'm not particularly interested in whether Gram's father is 'like the real thing' or if Val Kilmer should play Gram Parsons in a film about Gram Parsons (which this is not.) I'm looking for insight into whether the film is any good and whether it's worth my twenty bucks, and for what it's worth, I'd say 'yes' to both.

There are some nice documentaries out there about mister Parsons, whilst this is a film which is clearly signed as being 'based on a true story'. If you're into the man and his music, I'd suggest you get one of those. If you'd like to see a movie which - although it won't rock your world - will put a grin on your face and make you feel just a little better about life, then I can recommend 'Grand Theft Parsons'.

In any case, his botching of this fascinating story must be why the movie never made it into theaters for more than a day. The fictitious characters are silly and/or unrealistic, and Gram's father is nothing like the real thing (why?). Read Phil Kaufman's autobiography, Road Mangler Deluxe, for the true account and to get to know Gram Parsons (who is basically just a stiff in the movie version) and the others involved.

However, being that I went into this expecting it to be a comedy, or at the very least humorous, I was completely disapointed. This movie is NOT A COMEDY, nor is it even funny most of the time.

It was not what I would have expected with Johnny Knoxville as the star. He plays Kaufman, best friend to and road manager for Gram Parson. Johnny doesn't shoot himself, or let alligators attack his nipples, or do any crazy stunts for that matter- he's just a very cool actor who gets into character and does a stellar job.

Grand Theft Parsons a rough and tumble road movie with some very meaningful sweet moments, as well as some very funny ones- many of which were courtesy of Christina Applegate. Also a guy named Michael Shannon plays the hippie along for the ride with Knoxville. Shannon totally steals the show.

I would highly recommend Grand Theft Parsons both to Gram fans and those unfamiliar with his work.

The story is the journey, and yet despite this there is a sufficient denouement for it to not just fizzle out at the end; it's climax is touching rather than moving.

I imagine this film will be rediscovered one day, and I hope that time will be kind to it. There are some genuinely original and funny moments - quite Coen brothersesque at times.

Johnny Knoxville is the star.  the main charecter who along with a buddy steals the body.  then travel in a yellow flower painted hearse.  I watched this for Christina Applegate who plays Gram' girl friend and she thinks she should have the body.  He role is pretty much a obnoxious hippie.
