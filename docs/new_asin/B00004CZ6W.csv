7920150,4,B00004CZ6W,Loved Keith David's character and several of the actors turned in workman performances. With double and triple crosses going on it's my kind of movie. But the most fascinating thing is that one of the major actors and producer or director were involved in a real life headlines grabbing incident that landed them both in jail. I digress. Watch the movie.,1472774400,,354,4.819672131147541
7920151,5,B00004CZ6W,It's intense.  There should be a part 2.  I'm an actor and would love to star in it as one of the lovers.,1437609600,,105,3.5217391304347827

7920154,5,B00004CZ6W,"I found this movie cool keith david really put on a performance and added much character to the plot. There are parts that did not jive w/the rest of the movie, but it low budget yet cool all the way.",1348099200,,200,4.025
7920155,4,B00004CZ6W,"I think it's a cool short film, and Keith David really does help the movie go a long way w/his performance.",1347148800,,107,4.142857142857143
7920156,2,B00004CZ6W,"Not one night, just view it once, then move on.  Another of the long line of indie ""gay interest"" films that homosexuals will add to their ""viewed it"" list. As one tv character mused, ""despite poor films, it is your duty to view and support gay cinema.""  Here is an example.

Luckily, there will not be a similar production for another 20 or so years.

I would add this dvd to my shelf holding ""U-Turn"", ""Truth or Consequences"" and ""Kalifornia"" only because it includes talented Keith David--""johns"", ""Men at Work"", ""Spawn"" and numerous other titles [see IMDB and the fan forum accalades].",1179705600,2,589,4.745098039215686
