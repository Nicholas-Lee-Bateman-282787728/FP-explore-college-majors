8169270,5,B000MGUZKC,"If you are into railroading as a hobby, this DVD series shows railroading across the world, in this case in the Mediterranean area. I find it interesting to see  different areas of railroading. The picture and audio are very good, and there's a lot of other items of interest.",1381881600,,276,4.63265306122449
8169271,3,B000MGUZKC,"I bought this because I like to travel on trains in foreign countries.  I enjoyed this DVD when they focused on trains, and the life around train stations, and the quick excursions into the surrounding areas.  Unfortunately, at least 1/3 of the DVD focused on visits to wineries (port and sherry).  If you're a fan of wineries, then this DVD is for you.  If you're just a fan of train journeys in a foreign land, you'll wonder why they spend so much time on wineries.",1232582400,3,467,4.458823529411765
