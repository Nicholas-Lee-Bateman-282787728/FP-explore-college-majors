8324994,5,B000BZ8MUY,Beginner guitar- level 2 is an easy to follow approach to learning guitar. The videos are very clear and include a split screen feature so that you can see both the right and left hands. The videos can be down loaded onto a video capable ipod which makes viewing the lessons easy. Videos are divided into short lessons and contain a loop feature that allows you to play a lesson over and over. Of course the greatest benefit is that you can learn at your on pace. I would definitely purchase more of these lessons.,1252627200,,514,4.421052631578948
8324995,5,B000BZ8MUY,"Listen people. This is it. If you want to learn to play guitar, this guide pretty much takes you by the hand and truly explains it in a way that makes so much sense. I've been trying to learn how to teach myself the guitar for years. Since starting this course, I have learned more in four weeks that two years reading other dull ""Guitar for Beginner Books"". I love it and highly recommend this course. Awesome.",1185494400,,411,4.35064935064935
8324996,4,B000BZ8MUY,"As with Level 1, the split-screen video presentation is very effective.  Also, there is a good mix of playing songs and learning basic mechanics such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, bends, etc.  However, the authors seem confused about whether to make this a true follow-on to Level 1 or a stand-alone product, and end up with something that is not quite either one.  On the one hand, it starts out with some very basic things (how to hold the guitar, how the strings are numbered, etc.) that are covered in Level 1.  On the other hand, there is no book with this one, so if you don't have level 1 you will want to buy a book of chords, as only a few are covered in the video.",1170633600,2,678,4.31496062992126
8324997,5,B000BZ8MUY,"I started w/ iPlayMusic's Level 1 product and loved it. This just took my play to the next level. Great lessons, fun songs and still that super-easy video method. There is no better video series out there for learning guitar- period!",1136160000,5,233,4.7073170731707314
