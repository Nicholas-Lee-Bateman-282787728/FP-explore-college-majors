8485734,5,B005T3AN46,"One of the original nwobhm bands that began that wave of metal back in the 80s. This live Dvd brings all of their past and present songs performed with excellence,great riffing,vocalist by Doogie White is an excellent fit. Great shots of all band members with short interviews tops this Dvd off,worth the money if you're a fan of this veteran British metal band.",1371427200,,362,4.761904761904762
8485735,5,B005T3AN46,"I am embarassed to say I had never heard of Tank until the revamped line up's 2010 release War Machine with vocalist Doogie White.  This was one of my top albums for 2010.  I immediately started trying to acquire their past albums as it turns out the band has been around since the early 80's.  The DVD War Machine Live captures the revitalised Tank performing tracks from War Machine as well as great tracks from their classic albums.  The DVD is shot in a small club somewhere in Poland and the band sound great and stand and deliver the metal without any gimmicks.  My only complaint is I wish they had waited and filmed a concert at one of the more high profile European festivals that I'm sure they must have played.  The club is too small and the lighting could have been better.  I still highly recommend this DVD for anyone into the twin guitar style metal of Maiden or Priest.  Tank are no clone and have their own identity and style, I only offer Maiden and Priest as a comparison as I'm sure Tank escaped many other metal fans attention over the years.  Get anything by Tank if you can.  They also released another cd in 2012 called War Nation, that I can not recommend highly enough.",1364342400,,1195,4.415525114155251
