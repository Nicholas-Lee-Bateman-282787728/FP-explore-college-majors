3655608,5,B001JAHQW0,"Its surprising though when this was on Australian TV how much of each episode was cut.  Not that that was a bad thing, all the cut stuff was American politics and it would appear there is/was a huge issue with the colour of people's skin - considering a lot of the ''humor'' (which also was cut) was based around the *faux pas* of appearing racist; again no loss that this quasi-humor was cut.  Nevertheless, season 2 is my favourite of all the MadTV seasons.",1372723200,,459,4.4523809523809526
3655609,5,B001JAHQW0,"As a huge fan of MadTV I'm so glad this second season came out finally! - I live in Switzerland and ordered it from the USA. Came in today and I watched half of it right away :)

- very good image quality, considering 4:3 SD TV-resolution
- no unwanted commercials etc. on the DVD
- may be watched without unwanted breaks
- sound is good
- DVD sealing seems high quality to me: smooth, rounded edge of the discs = long life expectancy!! (cheap ones have hard, sharp edges and so, air may enter between the 2 layers)

So: It's just what we fans expect it to be! - Not more, not less. And I hope we'll not only see all 5 promised seasons from that DVD company, but also season 6-14 (Please!!) .",1372032000,,692,4.118518518518519
3655610,5,B001JAHQW0,i just order it & i cant wait for season 3 come out & i also need download more mad tv on xbl & there will be season 4 & 5 cant wait for those,1370822400,,142,3.085714285714286
3655611,5,B001JAHQW0,Completely funny!!!! I Love it and watch it all the time and also share with my friends.  Looking forward to some more season of Mad TV.,1370044800,,136,4.230769230769231
3655612,5,B001JAHQW0,"While I wasn't happy to wait so long for the second season, I'm very happy that it finally came out!  Here's the rundown:

The set is composed of four discs, one-side each (unlike season one, which was three discs, both sides).  There are five or six episodes per disc.  There aren't any special features to speak of, but they're not needed.  We're here for the content, right?

The episodes are:
Disc 1
  Christina Applegate
  Ice-T
  Kim Coles
  Jack Wagner
  Neve Campbell
  Kevin McDonald

Disc 2
  Joe Rogan
  French Stewart
  Harry Connick, Jr.
  Andrea Martin
  Superbowl Special

Disc 3
  Rodney Dangerfield
  Queen Latifah
  Tommy Davidson
  Bobcat Goldthwait
  Pauly Shore
  Thomas Calabro

Disc 4
  Mark Curry
  Adam Arkin
  Ryan Stiles
  David Faustino
  LL Cool J

At the beginning of ever episode, you get a ""Coming up on MadTv"" promo that previews some of the sketches for that episode.  I would have preferred special features as opposed to a preview before the episode, but that's okay.

There are some great impressions and sketches, such as Phil Lamarr as Michael Jackson and Snoop Dogg (then known as Snoop Doggy Dogg).  Christina Applegate gets the season off to a great start with her beauty, wit, and talent.  This season is worth watching more than once.  Purchase the set!  You won't regret it!",1368748800,9,1319,4.806451612903226
3655613,5,B001JAHQW0,"It's about freaking time that those clowns at Warner Home Video finally started putting out the rest of Mad TV. I scooped up season 2 as soon as I saw it at my local Walmart where I work, and it was definitely worth the wait and worth the price. There's not a single episode in this set that doesn't crack me up and leave me in stiches, this set is hilarious. I understand that season 3 will be coming out later this year so I'm looking forward to picking that one up too.",1364860800,8,472,4.086021505376344
3655614,5,B001JAHQW0,"THis show is still as funny as it was when it was first aired...I can't wait for
season 2...This is worth watching repeatly",1358726400,6,123,4.391304347826087
3655615,5,B001JAHQW0,"Mad TV may rerun on Comedy Central, but the show still need more DVD releases.

It has been 5 years since Season 1 came out on DVD!

3655762,5,B001JAHQW0,"I've always liked Mad TV, so when I saw in season 1 that season 2 would be coming soon, I couldn't wait. Turns out we'd have to wait a pretty damn long time before season 2 finally came out. In fact, it was nine years between the release of season one and season two on DVD. So I have to praise Shout! Factory for correcting this grave mistake and releasing this season.

The sketches are usually very simple, and there are some hilarious jokes. Obviously some of the humor can get quite adult at times, but it usually sticks to being hard PG rated material. These comedians are always wonderful to watch. The chemistry between Phil Lamarr, Nicole Sullivan, Mary Scheer Orlando Jones, Artie Lange, David Herman, Debra Wilson and Bryan Callen is a very important element of this show's success. These very talented people simply have everything that it takes to make the show click.

Wherever one actor was lacking in another area, another would compensate and provide a wealth of comedic genius. True, there are some sketches that didn't quite hit the mark, but somehow when watching these guys perform, that really doesn't matter much. They were always very funny, the guest stars were a welcome treat even if you didn't know them that well. The mean-spirited humor was well-written and executed with such energy that I've got imprinted memories of laughing so hard that they've become very important and precious memories to me.

If you loved the first season, this season is too a must.",1404345600,4,1489,4.763565891472868
3655763,5,B001JAHQW0,"I bought MADtv season 1, The Complete season. It's very nice to recap what I missed as an 11-12 year old, back in 1995-96. Season 1 had closed captions along with subtitles. Any of the viewers choosing. Plus it has extras. Like the gag reel, deleted scenes, and the 200th episode from season 9 (2003-2004)

Fans are very happy that Shout Factory has finally released seasons 2-4 on DVD. Season 2 is just like season 1. The break promos got newly improved. The introductions of the cast is still the same as season 1. Last season for  Bryan Callen, Orlando Jones, and Artie Lange.

The only problem is: No subtitles or closed captions. Without the extras. But, still a must have for MADtv fans out there. Box looks nice in clear form. That holds the 4 disc.

I bought MADtv: Seasons 3 and 4 at Amoeba Records in Hollywood. Now I own all 4 seasons. Hoping Shout Factory gets to release season 5. (1999-2000)",1398038400,,905,4.5

3655770,4,B001JAHQW0,"A classic Sketch Comedy Show that tackles many taboo subjects while making you laugh.  MADTV is not for the squeamish or the easily offended.  There is no such thing as political correctness in this show and every issue that is ""made fun of"" is more to make you see just how ridiculous being offended really is.  The 1st Amendment is openly practiced in this show with little bias politically.  (All sides of every issue are made fun of... eventually).

I did not think the skits where that funny, I am a snob when it comes to it. BUT, at least they are trying, and are a limited of shows like this to choose from anyways, so it is respect more than anything. Anyways, a must watch regardless, awesome special guests throughout the season. I would not watch them again myself, just purchased to watch them once, then resold. Not great, but watchable.
