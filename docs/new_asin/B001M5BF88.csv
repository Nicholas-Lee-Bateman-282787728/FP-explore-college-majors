8320490,5,B001M5BF88,"This is the first film of Joselito when it was 9 years old, with a simple plot but with an extraordinary performance of him as if he were an experienced actor, where he  sings the classic songs in his superb and incomparable voice such as La Estella y el Monaguillo, La Campanera, Ol la Barca Velera, El Pregon de las Campanas, Galopa Jaca, among others, The edition of this film is taken with care . It is an edition of the film for collectors and lovers of the art of this phenomenon of masses that was in its time Joselito.",1241913600,3,526,4.26

8320492,3,B001M5BF88,"Joselito made so many films demonstrating his wondeful voice range, and beautiful songs.  I was a little disappointed in ths film, but still love him.  I wish more of his better films were released.  If you enjoy Joselito, this film was OK.  It seems that the films he made in Mexico were a lot better.  I love ""EL CABALLO BLANCO"", and ""LAS ADVENTURAS DE JOSELITO Y PUGARCITO"".  They contain a lot of my favorite songs, and display great humor.  I'd like to see more of his films.",1236902400,3,480,4.448275862068965
