4935198,5,B00637HXNG,"I was surprised and delighted to find this disc available at a local big box store, although not yet released to all outlets.  This is what 3D is all about!  I have a 59 inch 3D TV, and a powerful surround speaker setup.  You are there!  The sound is very clear, and you feel as if you're part of the crowd.  The 3D is also very well done, with lots of depth, and very clear video.  The camera work is excellent.  And what about the band?  Well, I'm not a Scorpions nut, but I love rock music, and this is as good as it gets.  From rockers to ballads, these guys really know how to put on a show.  The twin guitar attack is ferocious, the drums thundering, and the lead singer's voice shines through it all, just as they did back in the 80's.  There are a number of shots from half way back in the audience, lots of people capturing it on their cellphones, and you really feel as if you're enjoying the concert right along with them.  Highly recommended.",1327795200,17,954,4.181318681318682
4935199,5,B00637HXNG,Just got this as a USA exclusive thru a big box chain. I don't have a 3D blu-ray player and I can CONFIRM that this WILL play in a standard blu-ray player. I have an older model Insignia player with the most current firmware I could download and this disc plays as any standard blu disc available. I am guessing if you have a 3D model it will probably play either way depending on your individual players setting. Picture and sound (DTS and PCM)are both present as audio options as well as a 33 minute documentary. 2 hours of pure heavy metal bliss for everyone to enjoy!!,1327536000,34,572,4.355140186915888

4935206,5,B00637HXNG,Very cool Video. I was a little worried about it being 3D. I was not really sure if it was worth the 3D experience but I have to say I really loved it in 3D. It also works in just Blu Ray players as well. Scorpions are still great as well. Klaus Meine is right on and his voice has not lost a step at all. Highly recommend to Scorpion fans or 80 Rock fans all the way.,1454198400,,368,3.730769230769231

4935218,3,B00637HXNG,"I must elaborate. First this is a fantastic show. The Scorpions are Totally Outstanding!!! The audience is totally energized by the band. The vdeo quality is first rate. Everything is going great until ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"". The DVD picture & sound stalls countless times. I clean the Blu Ray player & the DVD & try the last two songa again. Same result. Disappointment for me I was going to give it a 5 star rating based on the band performances.
  Next I try to watch the Bonus: Behind The Scenes"". I select English captions (subtitles for translation) and begin. The picture plays, people are speaking in german (totally understandable) however, the subtitles stall. For example: One roadie is asked what he will do after the tour & he says "" I don't know, maybe sell asparagus & tomatoes."" That caption stays locked on the picture for over 8 minutes. Klaus Meine, Rudolf Shenker, and Matthias Jabs are  interviewed (very interesting to me) yet relatively very very little  is translated in captions. So unfortunately all of that information is lost.
  I think the Scorpions (musical perfectionists) would be appalled if they saw what the end product of their concert and backstage interviews turned out.
  So you may inquire: Why not return the DVD? Because I live in China now. The bureaucratic BS involved with documenting payment, taxes, duties, and import customs fees in order to ship the DVD back for replacement would be a monumental headache. It's not the fantastic performance by the Scorpions, it's the poor engineering of the DVD that brings the rating down.",1433462400,2,1579,4.887640449438202

4935220,5,B00637HXNG,I love the blu-ray of this concerts. The 3D is absolutely amazing on my TV. Several times I felt I could actually reach out and grab a guitar or the mic from Klaus.

4935228,3,B00637HXNG,"Too bad this incredible show was recorded in substandard definition and without the latest 3D technology and equipment, the best that was available at that time in 2011. It is very grainy and the 3D effects are fair at best. Regular 1080P Blu Ray would have been a much better experiance than this production. Sadly this remarkable show recorded in Germany was one of the best ever performances captured, now lost in time with no true HD footage to save it. The good news is that the 5.1 surround sound is fantastic!  The setlist is exactly the same as one show I attended in August 2010 on this tour in Salt Lake City Utah at USANA Outdoor Ampitheatre. This show was mind bending and one never to forget, out of many I attended over the last 30 years. Be prepared for a less than true HD video experiance as well as poor early 3D quality effects. With that said, it is well worth owning and watching over and over. The disc plays on any Blu Ray player in 2D or 3D. It looks quite good on a smaller size screen, such as a 15.6 laptop with Blu Ray optical drive or small TV screen. The increadible sound, musical performance, crowd participation along with Klaus Meine's German language narrative more than make up for the poor video quality. I dearly love this show and hold it close to my heart, as all Scorpions fans will. Watch it with an open mind and enjoy history made in Germany.",1418256000,,1386,4.4140625

4935236,5,B00637HXNG,This video has beautiful 3-D effects. Makes you feel like you are a part of the audience. I was a little disappointed in the Scorpions music selection for the concert. Some of the songs themselves left something to be desired; they are just not on par with the rest of the music this group is known for. Other than just not liking some of the song selections the concert is excellent & I would definately  recommend it to any fan of the Scorpions.,1403308800,,447,4.385542168674699

This isn't just an incredible concert, but they filmed it in 3D, and they knew what they were doing! I'm a 3D snob, and I have to say this is one of the best uses of 3D I have seen. You literally feel like you are in the crowd watching the show, and it is an AMAZING concert! I'm literally speechless. Let me say INCREDIBLE, AWESOME, and AMAZING a few more times..,.",1397260800,6,464,4.1098901098901095
4935240,5,B00637HXNG,It is highly recommended to die hard and casual fans a like!  I can see a benefit to bands putting out their concert videos in 3D after something like this.  It really brings the concert into your home the closest way possible and it has a strong fairly well done 5.1 dts-hd master audio track to go with it.  I will say though 2 things I wish it had were a 7.1 dts-hd master audio track and I wish the subtitles for the concert and especially the behind the scenes section were more accurate and on point as you only get about 1/3 to maybe at best half the subtitles leaving having to guess what they are saying if you don't speak German.  Otherwise totally worth it and especially for the price on amazon!,1395878400,2,707,4.253731343283582
4935241,5,B00637HXNG,"I've always loved The Scorpions.  And I love 3D.  Having seen other 3D concert videos, and being disappointed (Joe Satriani's, for example), this one is very well done, and I love watching it and showing it to others.",1393545600,,217,4.684210526315789

4935251,5,B00637HXNG,"I have to point out that I do not yet have a 3D TV,and, as such my review deals more with the performance of the band and the audio mix. I do have to say that it has a remarkably clear picture, and I can get a sense of what I've read from other reviewers regarding the advantageous close ups with various members of the group and how those scenes must really pop in 3D. Great choice of a setlist, not bogged down at all, and a good cross-section of old and new. VERY cool guitars,especially Rhythm guitarist Rudolph Schenker's automobile-themed guitars. Also very eye-catching were the Flying V and Explorer styled acoustic guitars played by Schenker and Lead Guitarist Mathias Jabs.
A very good punchy audio surround mix makes this show a keeper. It's a shame that these guys are about to hang it up, as they appear to have a lot of mileage left,but it's better to go out on top,I suppose. This event was an awesome way to document this epic band at the top of their game.",1372377600,3,973,4.3812154696132595

Also, when they did some smoke effect on the stage the picture got rather ""flat"" but I've noticed that on other Blu-Ray concerts when they use smoke on stage with lighting or lasers.

The picture freezes a lot and for some reason only what is in the foreground of the picture seems to stay focused. Everything in the background shakes from side to side during the entire concert. Imagine watching an entire movie oscillating your head side to side really quickly. Its annoying and nauseating. I don't know if it is only my copy that does that? All my other 3D movies play without any problems. The silver lining is that I was able to see this concert live, so I am not left wondering how cool it must have been to be there. Bottom line: quality is inconsistent, sometimes it is incredible other times it seems it was recorded with a Hi-8 handheld recorder so I'd avoid buying this blu-ray at all costs.",1354752000,,895,4.397590361445783

Only after looking at the making of it on the bonus reel does one get a true impression of how monumentous a task putting this together must have been. Given the size of the crowd, they really need to sell a lot of these to start turning a profit when one thinks of how expensive it is to record, edit and master an entire concert in 3D.

I would have given 5 stars, but somehow the atmosphere doesn't compare to the Wacken concert...the fans didn't seem to get into it as much...maybe the demographic was different, as I saw a lot of more mature folk in this, as opposed to at Wacken.

On this one which is all region and needs a 3d tv to really apprieciate this blu ray, really is a excellent show. And in 3d it looks even better than a normal concert video. It was shot in 3d by professionals too. The big hits from the 1979-90's era on this one too. With a few other songs. Sadly there are no earlier songs from the 1972-78 era on here. Those songs sound alot different than the later efforts but they are still great.",1343692800,,692,4.290076335877862

Can anyone give me an answer as I don't want to be disappointed when I recieve it. I do not want the Blu-Ray version as I do not own a Blu-Ray player. Also will the 3-D version still play in regular DVD players if not then this is a drawback and do you/I need 3-D glasses to see it? Please respond.",1340496000,,570,3.71900826446281

After watching this disc I can say only: WOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!! x2 !!! Two times,because the 3D and because the concert.
This disc is the perfect showoff disc when you have 3D devices!!!! Unbelievable 3D quality,much better than most of 3D movies or animations. I couldn't move from couch for 2 hours,till the concert ended,I enjoyed every second of it and didn't get dizzy or headache from the 3D.
The concert,the music,the band,everything is perfect,this is a must have for any Scorpions fan!!!!! I am almost 40 now,i grove up with Scorpions,they were my favorite band when I was teenager ....now,25 years later this guys still ROCKS!!!!!!!

The 11 cameras are all 3D and placed in the right places to have the best experience during the entire concert. Even the behind the scene in the extra is filmed in 3D. Throughout the concert, you are in the audience with hands standing all around you. The band knows where the cameras are and they are doing everything to take advantage of it.
The menu is beautiful, the song selection is amazing. The DTS-HD audio is as usual with Scorpions, crispy clean and very well adjusted to hear all the instruments equally and Klaus' voice perfectly.
Thank you Scorpions.",1333756800,11,682,4.691666666666666
4935285,5,B00637HXNG,"My DVD had a manufacturing defect. It played  the video and audio for songs 1 - 10 perfectly but songs 11 -21 would freeze/skip.  Unfortunately I was past the 30-day limit for a full refund by the time I played the DVD past song 10 so I am out of luck - Amazon will not give me a full refund and won't pay shipping - so it is not worth the effort to send it back.  Beware - of the manufacturing defects!

Important Update:
The DVD did not have a defect - it was a problem with may Samsung DVD firmware; firmware needed to be upgraded.

Although my Samsung DVD is only 1 year old, it required a firmware upgrade in order to play the ""Scorpions
Live in 3-D"" correctly. After downloading the new software/firmware to a USB drive from the Samsung support site and
installing it, the Scorpions DVD worked correctly.  It really confused me  that the DVD would play normally on the first 10 tracks and then have problems starting at track 11, which made me think it was a manufacturing
defect - but it really was a firmware problem.

My guess is this ""Scorpions Live in 3-D"" was recorded using leading-edge Blue Ray technology all customers should upgrade their firmware.

Klaus' vocals are still great, and the band is tight. A nice mix of old, and new tracks here, but was surprised ""No One Like You"" was not on set list.

Editing is fast but uncanny in its operation. Camera subject and angles are timed with the music.

Generally, when there is a solo, that is the view - the subject of the solo. This is where most editors fail. They don't seem to care what the music is doing. Here, the music is what the video is all about.

3D is best I've seen.",1472688000,3,381,4.053333333333334
