8035756,4,B00030EXKU,"The version of the ""Village People: Live in Japan"" DVD that I own was purchased from Amazon.fr (the Amazon.com store in France [scroll all the way to the bottom of this screen and you will see the links for the Amazon outlets in different countries]). I paid EUR 17,70 for the DVD and EUR 16,40 for expedited shipping, for a total of EUR 34,10 (about $59.00 in US currency). I received the item in three business days.

Before you purchase this DVD from anyone, make sure you contact the seller to verify what format the disc is in.

NTSC vs. PAL
United States DVDs are in the NTSC format (not PAL). Discs formatted in PAL, which is Europe's standard, have a different frame rate (25 frames per second) than discs in the US (around 28 fps). If you can get a PAL disc to play in a NTSC DVD player on a US television, the picture will look warped, the aspect ratio will not look right (stretched or squeezed image), and the color will be nil.

""Region 1"" vs. all other regions
United States discs are formatted for Region 1 DVD players. Discs of other regions will not play on US DVD players, with the exception of Region 0 discs, which will play on any DVD player in the world.

To play a PAL disc with a region of anything other than Region 1, you have a couple of options, the easiest of which is to purchase a multi-region DVD player that can convert from PAL to NTSC. They are not expensive (less than $100 in most cases). For example, this is an excellent player: >>HIGHLIGHT & COPY & PASTE in Amazon Search Bar >> Pioneer DV-383S Multi Region Code Free Zone Free DVD Player PAL/NTSC on ANY TV << <<

The other option is to override your DVD player's factory settings via its remote by pressing a predefined ""testing code."" You can find the codes easily on the internet simply by performing a search. Type something like this in the search bar: ""hack region code"" and then the model number of your DVD player. Generally, all this will do is make your player region free. It will not make your player capable of playing PAL discs.

So, before you buy a DVD that is imported, like ""Village People: Live in Japan,"" these are the questions you'll want answered in order to see if the disc will play on your player at home:

""What region is the disc?"" and ""Is the disc in the NTSC or PAL format?""

The ""Village People: Live in Japan"" DVD available from France is in PAL and is Region 2.  If this review is attached to a listing for the DVD with this or a similar title, the listing MAY be for a DVD in a different format.

You can always watch a PAL disc on your computer and the picture and sound will be fine. Generally, though, you're only allowed up to 5 times to change the region code of the video playback system on your PC. There is software available to get beyond that little problem. Just search for it on the internet.

Now for a review of the concert:

The Village People recorded this concert at the Budokan Hall in Tokyo a short time after they finished filming their movie, ""Can't Stop the Music"" a/k/a ""Discoland: Where the Music Never Stops"" a/k/a ""You Can't Stop the Music!,"" which came out in June 1980.

There is a live band on the stage behind the men, but it only plays at the beginning of the show, during the introductions, and in between songs. In other words, all of the music comes directly off their records (like karaoke). The backing vocals are also prerecorded. The only one singing live is Ray Simpson, the lead singer (The Policeman).

The Soldier (Alex Briley) has a solo called ""Save Me"" and he sings this song live, too.

By the time this concert was filmed, the group was already quite accustomed to having fans scream and cheer at them, which may explain why they seemed none too pleased with their Japanese audience who essentially just sat there quietly while the group performed some of their lesser known tunes. David ""The Construction Worker"" Hodo had already achieved notoriety as everyone's favorite member of the Village People - so when he was introduced to the non-speaking Japanese audience and no one clapped, he gave them a disgusted look and a wave of his hand, saying, ""Oh, you people suck!""

At first, David Hodo truly looked like he was enjoying himself, whipping his trademark hips with gusto (the first thing he does when he pops out on stage is to grab himself - ? la Michael Jackson). But the life seemed to drain out of Hodo after his grand introduction fell on flat Japanese ears. After that, he just seemed to go through the motions of the tired dance routines the men had to learn and repeat everywhere they performed.

Glen Hughes ""The Leatherman"" (God rest his soul - he died of cancer a few years ago) constantly swiped at his nose, which made him look like he had just done a couple of lines back stage. And he looked quite zoned out.

Felipe Rose ""The Indian,"" the one member of the Village People who seemed most happy with his body, often had a dumb look on his face, as if he was thinking, ""I hope I'm doing the right routine.""

Randy Jones ""The Cowboy"" appears to have wet his pants toward the end of the concert.

Alex Briley ""The Soldier"" or ""Navy Seaman"" also amazed me with his deep and soulful vocals during his -- and the only -- solo during the concert.  His place in the Village People lineup has always been far stage right (sort of like a period at the end of a sentence).  A great deal of camera time is spent on Briley during the show and his abilities as both a dancer and singer finally get the attention they deserve.

Ray Simpson, ""The Policeman,"" has a powerful voice, a fact that really becomes evident in this concert. Most of his singing occurs at the top-most reaches of his vocal range, so I was surprised his voice held out for the duration of the 70-minute show.

For most of the concert, only Simpson's microphone was turned on and every time he passed by Felipe Rose, you could hear the jingling of the little Indian's bells on his toes.

Simpson also had the annoying habit of lowering his microphone when he wasn't singing, causing the mike to get a little too close to the monitor speaker on the floor, resulting in ear-piercing feedback.

The most awful, worst possible aspect to this DVD is that the concert is in MONO! Can you believe that? Later, during the sweetening process (perhaps for this video release), the sounds of audience roaring were dubbed in. Oddly enough, the roars of the audience are in stereo. It's actually quite amusing to ""hear"" the audience roar while we ""see"" them sitting there, quiet and stoic.

The sheer fun of watching these guys perform was worth the price of the DVD. It's nostalgic, yet hysterical at the same time.
