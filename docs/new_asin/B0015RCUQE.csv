If you haven't tried TNA out, give this one a shot.  I'll also recommend Bound For Glory 2007, Great Show.",1208217600,,286,4.339622641509434

8259597,4,B0015RCUQE,"The best matches on the card were The Lethal Lockdown match which was a good reminder of the old NWA/WCW Wargames matches and even the old ECW back in the 90's & The TNA World championship match between Samoa Joe & Kurt Angle which was perfectly booked and executed. The worst matches were The Queen Of Cage match,the intergender tag team match & the Cuffed in the Cage match. Those matches were a bad reminder of WCW in it's dying days and even ECW on Sci-Fi. The Rest are O.K.I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1276819200,,510,4.214285714285714
8259598,4,B0015RCUQE,TNA fans were dreaming of this day since Samoa Joe walked into TNA in 2005.  Lockdown '08 is probably the second best Pay-Per-View TNA has put on next to Bound For Glory 2007.  The crowd was obviously into the matches and this made it very enjoyable to watch on DVD.  The main event was probably the best match of the year for TNA so far.  Angle and Joe always set the house on fire.  I recommend this for all fans of TNA.,1220227200,,422,4.097560975609756
8259599,3,B0015RCUQE,"1. Jay Lethal vs. Curry Man vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Shark Boy vs. Johnny Devine vs. Consequences Creed in an xscape match for the x division title- This was a good match to kick off the show almost every year since lockdown has started they have kicked off the show with an x division match which I think Is a very good idea. There was just so much energy in this match. There are always a lot of high risk moves in these matches and this one was no different. I really liked the order of eliminations as we did not get to see lethal and dutt again and we got to see some new match ups. Great match to kick off the show. Winner and still X Division Champ Jay Lethal. Match Rating 8.5/10.
2. Angelina Love vs. Velvet Sky vs. Salinas vs. Rhaka Khan vs. Traci Brooks vs. Christy Hemme vs. Jacqueline vs. Roxxi Laveaux in a queen of the cage match - This was not as bad as I thought it would be. Going into this match it look like it would be to clustered but the two wrestlers got in the ring quick and they got down to it. Not a bad match nothing to write home about but it's worth a look. Winner Roxxi Laveaux. Match Rating 5.5/10.
3. BG James vs. Kip James- Well this going into the match looked bad and no surprise here this was an awful match. No blood or anything after all the heat between these two. Not worth a look at all ending sucked and the after math was very predictable. Winner BG James. Match Rating 2/10.
4. LAX vs. The Motor City Machine Guns vs. The Rock N Rave Infection vs. Scott Stiner and Petey Williams vs. Kaz and Eric Young vs. Black Reign and Relik in a cuffed in the cage match- Well this also had the opportunity to be a big cluster mess but it turned out ok. I am not going to say I really support the booking here and all the teams involved but they made the best of what they could. The rules were kind of dumb but it was something new to try. I don't think this will be a match they will keep trying to use. I thought it was a terrible call having super eric come in and take out 4 guys its unrealistic and not good booking. Winners Super Eric and Kaz. Match Rating 7/10.
5. Awsome Kong and Raisha Saeed vs. Gail Kim and ODB- When you watch this match you will think going into this it's a handicap match but awesome kongs partner came in and fooled everyone as she really knows how to wrestle. I read something on the Internet were it said that Raisha Saeed knows how to wrestle really well and has been training. It showed in this match and it made it a very enjoyable match. Winners Gail Kim and ODB. Match Rating 7/10.
6. Booker T and Sharmell vs. Robert Roode and Payton Banks- I really like booker t but going into this match I was not that excited because this feud has been going on for 4 months now and still noting is resolved. I think that even booker t cant hold a feud and make it interesting for 4 months. Anyway a ok match not much to say. Winners Booker T and Sharmell. Match Rating 6.5/10.
7. Team Cage Christian Cage, Rhino, Sting, Kevin Nash, and Matt Morgan vs. Team Tomko Tomko, AJ Styles, Team 3D and Cowboy James Storm in a Lethal Lockdown Match- This was a very good lethal lockdown match and took us back thee years to the spot with aj styles on the ladder with the table. Just lots of solid action but this was brutal to watch. Not much to say second best match of the night and you will like it a lot. Winners Team Cage. Match Rating 9.5/10.
8. Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe For the TNA World Heavywieght Championship- I liked the strategy they used here with going with the mma type booking for the first 5 minutes lots of people disagree. But lets think we have already seen these guys wrestle 4 times its nice to see them try something new here After that it was back to kick butt style. Angle and Joe never disappoint and this was no difference. Just everything you want from submission to false finishes its. All here I agree with the booking giving Joe the title even though I am an angle fan he deserves it. Winner and new TNA World HeavyWeight Champ Samoa Joe. Match Rating 10/10.

Well that raps up another I would give TNA Lockdown 2008 a grade of 56/80 which means this was good ppv just almost an awesome pvv missed it by 1 %. Anyway pick this up as soon as you can anywhere there really is more good than bad so come on and pick it up. If you could tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1215129600,3,4397,4.124708624708624
8259600,2,B0015RCUQE,"looking back at a reviewI wrote when the pay per view finished I still wonder why I bought the show. (This was the review, so these were my thoughts of the show based on what we knew THEN.)

maybe I was expecting too much but for ordering my first TNA pay per view, it just felt like I was watching a 3 hour impact. NOT worth the money

I'm ok with Jay Lethal keeping the TNA X Division Championship but having devine be in the final two was a joke. Plus having Dutt taken out first was just a bad idea. Ok if Lethal had to keep his title I would have taken Creed out first (don't really care about him) then Shark Boy (Please kill that gimmick now, PLEASE), next Devine. Have Lethal pin Dutt, (maybe just maybe add to the story there) then allow curry man and Lethal to put on a good match.

Roxxi Laveaux becoming the ""Queen of the Cage"" was just a way to get all of the knockouts in and progress a boring storyline.

BG James taking on Kip James should have happened years ago, but I guess they needed the ""former partners face off at Lockdown"" match

Super Eric winning the ""Cuffed in the Cage"" Match. Ok I guess I can deal with this attempting to move a storyline, but after the pre match attack it was so obvious that Super Eric would arrive.

ODB & Gail Kim defeating TNA Women's Champion Awesome Kong & Raisha Saeed was a good match, but why in the hell is it happening before the ""mixed tag"" match. Sadly for Kong even though she is fun to watch TNA has built her up so strongly in a very slim divison. (ODB, Kim, Roxxi and maybe Raisha Saeed if the story goes that route are her only worthy challengers) That Kong will get the title ""stolen"" from her so the other knockouts can have a reasonable chance.

Booker T & eye candy 1 defeated Robert Roode & eye candy 2 in a Mixed Tag Team Match. Can we get this over with, I've seen Booker vs. Roode before.

Team Cage defeating Team Tomko in the Lethal Lockdown Match was nice to watch, of course Sting had to be the last one out (needs to retire, and hey he is my second favorite all time, but his time is over though). I was a little shocked that Nash was member number 3 for Team Cage. It was just missing that ""major spot"". (and no going off the short ladder onto a table was not a major spot. If the ladder would have tipped the other way allowing them to fall off the cage, that would have been the major spot.

Angle vs. Joe, sorry that was just a victim of too much hype, Being 1000% sure that Joe was going to win (without spoiler notes, come on who honestly thought Angle was going to win) just takes a lot of the excitement out of a match. That start did not help either, and the fact that I heard myself say ""hey your in a cage match, why don't you guys start using it"" was a bad sign.

To top it all off the first thing I see after the match is not a video recap of the show but a preview for the next Pay per view, totally focusing on Angle. (wow what a way to treat the new champ, in what they built up to be the biggest match in history.)

And no I am not a TNA hater, and I actually watch TNA more then WWE but come on they can do better

8259602,2,B0015RCUQE,"This is the first time I've done this with a TNA PPV as normally, I would review match by match but I'm not going to waste my time here & get the point. Normally LockDown is one of TNA's best PPV efforts & is seen as one of their big PPVs (like how WWE has Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series). However, this was the worst effort yet & the worst PPV I've seen since Turning Point. It was TNA's bad (and I'm putting it lightly) booking along with just trying to shove everyone on the card that really dragged this PPV down. The undercard had matches either sucked (B.G./Kip after the excellent buildup with the ""Rough Cut"" segments, the mixed tag), had stupid booking (""Cuffed In A Cage"" was a huge cluster & had the #1 contendor/challenger for the World Title at the next PPV in Scott Steiner eliminated FIRST!!! while the comedy act in Eric Young/Super Eric won the match), or were just decent (Knockouts tag match & the ""Queen Of The Cage"" after the whole ""get in the cage"" part which was a waste) with the only above average being the Xscape match with the X division. In the main event, Samoa Joe FINALLY won the TNA Championship but their match was a disappointment to me as they tried to work a Mixed Martial Arts style which kept them grounded throughout the entire match instead of doing the type of wrestling that what made their first 3 match series TNA classics. The best match on the card was the Lethal Lockdown match which some cool spots but that wasn't enough to save this PPV.

This is a PPV was a dud with only 3 matches being ones I would watch again while the main event where Joe wins the World Title (which I feel is heavily overdue) didn't have the big payoff as the match was boring the first half of it. So in the end, unless you just REALLY have to see one of the 3 good matches on here...skip it.",1211068800,,1847,4.338150289017341
