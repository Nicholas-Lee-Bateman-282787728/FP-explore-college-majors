2699203,2,B000KX0IMM,"Trilogies can reward a movie viewer with expansive character and plot development - witness the Godfather. Similarly, Infernal Affairs has a part 2 chronology prequel to part 1 both with fully realized stand alone plots that complement each other as a set, albeit not on a grand multi-generation and geographic scale as Coppola's classic epic. Unfortunately after a confused first and a second somewhat forced attentive watching part 3 remained vague and annoying with its choppy flashback and flash forward vignettes which have little cohesive coherence except as related to parts 1 & 2. The twist ending IMO seems unbelievable and unsatisfying. Part 3 plays like a compilation of deleted scenes from 1 & 2 + an alternate ending fluffed out to feature length. Badly.",1341878400,3,767,5.144
2699204,4,B000KX0IMM,"Acting and movie was great but the overall storyline felt forced.  This is part 3 of a 3-part serie and if you want to, I would recommend starting with Part 1 and subsquent part so you won't be disappointed by the earlier parts that was released later.",1340150400,,252,4.361702127659575
2699205,5,B000KX0IMM,"I don't think this is overrated one bit; a travelogue of madness, corruption, and the looming shadow of slain innocence, ""INF3"" is damn near perfect.  Andy Lau definitely takes the cake here as the corrupt and just about totally crazy Inspector Ming, now head of Internal Affairs.

The dreamlike flow of the film takes it's cues from David Lynch; and you can tell that the director was very flattered that Martin Scorsese adapted ""INF"" for ""The Departed""--when Wai (likable as always playing undercover cop Yan in Ming's demented flashbacks) smashes an ashtray over a rival Triad's head just as DiCaprio smashed a glass over someone's head in Marty's version.  Plus, the corrupt officer from the original is now renamed ""Officer Billy"", like ""Billy Costigan"".  So I guess people who complain about Scorsese ""ripping off"" ""INF"" should stop, since the creators themselves seem tickled pink.

Rather than people just getting shot constantly and elevator doors opening and closing, we Mak's real writing and directorial talent as he depicts the tortured soul of Ming, a man awash in the blood he has on his hands: it is clear that his mission to ""be the good guy"" was a failure from the getgo.  As Shen, the undercover cop playing arms dealer says, ""Men are changed by events, not events by men""--true, and Ming can never escape the events he changed.

We are also treated to some of the things we didn't see in the original: Eric Tsang is touching as the confused Triad Hon Sam, so loyal to Yan that he breaks a bottle over his head to protect from ultimate retribution from another gang.  The theme of self sacrifice is strong in this film, and vengeance as well: the unforgettable last scene in which Ming finally ""answers for his crimes"" (without managing to accomplish the goal of getting rid of himself entirely) is unforgettable.  This movie is art.

A brilliant conclusion to the trilogy.",1202688000,3,1892,4.8478260869565215
2699206,4,B000KX0IMM,This is a good movie don't get me wrong but it was a real let down. This was not as strong as the first 2 of the trilogy. The one thing we do get to see is the downfall of andy laus charector both mentally and profesionally. The movie shift to much from the past to the present that you start to whish that they stayed in one place for one second so that you can get a grasp of what is going on. This is like the godfather the first 2 are a masterpiece but the 3rd part even though it is good it leaves you dissapointed by the way it turned out in the end. If it was not for the great performances from everyone this would have gotten a three star from me.,1172275200,,656,3.8308823529411766
2699207,3,B000KX0IMM,"Infernal Affairs III doesn't live up to its predecessors, but not for want of trying. Its biggest problem isn't the intriguing prequel/sequel structure that juxtaposes the aftermath of the first film as Andy Lau tries to be the good man he wants to be, with disastrous consequences, alongside the last months of Tony Leung's undercover man life. Rather, it's the fact that it takes so long to really find its stride. It's not until the two-thirds mark that it really kicks in with a hospital scene where past, present and possible future collide that completely wrongfoots you. You're suddenly in a whole new place that makes you rethink what you thought was going on, leading to a powerful ending that isn't as affecting as II, but leaves one character quite literally in the circle of unending, inescapable hell. It's also here that the theme of loss of identity starts to work overtime, as Lau forgets who he is, participating in the dead Leung's sessions with the court-appointed psychiatrist and setting out to expose a corrupt cop oblivious to the fact that the evidence incriminates himself.

While Lau spends most of the movie thinking he's digging a tunnel when he's actually digging his own grave, the flashback scenes involving Leung are very different to his character's trajectory in the previous movies. If Lau is a bullet train to hell, for the first time we see Leung's character in his happier moments as he is filled with hope for a future the captions gradually counting down to his death constantly deny him. In that sense it's less subversive than the first two films, which broke time-honored HK thriller tradition by letting the bad guys win, but it works on its own terms, and while it does take too long to sort itself out (or rather for the characters to lose sight of themselves), there's a constant governing intelligence to it that separates it from other HK pictures of its ilk. Indeed, it's only really in comparison to the other two films that the third seems the lesser. It probably would have helped if they'd spent a little more time on it - it was released only two months after the second film. However, you really need to see the films in the order they were made to get the most out of them: nearly all of the film's emotional touchstones (such as the oft-repeated ""Everything will be ok tomorrow"" or the song that first linked the characters) relate to the previous films.",1169078400,4,2412,4.742857142857143

8159611,5,B000KX0IMM,"Infernal Affairs III is the final movie of the Infernal Affairs trilogy. It tells the story before and after the events of the first Infernal Affairs. Added to that,it gives also an explanation of the consequences of the events in the second Infernal Affairs. Overall,it tells everything that needs to be told and ties the gaps about everything in the story of Inspector Lau and Yan.

To fully appreciate it and understand the story completely,one should have probably seen the first and second film. It definitely won't work as a stand alone film as some events aren't fully explained. As for the story of Inspector Lau into becoming a full fledged cop,I felt that it was somewhat lacking in terms of interest as it tried to become more of a psychological thriller to distinguish itself from the other films in the trilogy. In trying to be different,it somehow came out short considering that Lau's character isn't interesting without the involvement of Yan. But despite of its shortcomings,I still consider it a good one as better than the second film but not as good as the first film which happens to be a classic.",1410220800,,1118,4.7927461139896375

Of course you have to be in the Chinese cop ""shoot-them-up"" mystery mode, if not , forget it.",1357344000,,186,4.3428571428571425
8159615,5,B000KX0IMM,"I'm glad I picked this up as I have always wanted to see if there was more to the story of ""The Departed"".  I wasn't disappointed.  From the hallucinations to the flashbacks, this movie ties the story together well.",1347926400,,215,4.487179487179487
