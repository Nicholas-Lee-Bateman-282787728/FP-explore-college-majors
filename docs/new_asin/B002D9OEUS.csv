3909987,5,B002D9OEUS,"This series of dvd's is a great collection of the different sciences there is.  My five year old grandson is hypnotized when we watch this together. He watches them over and over, and can tell you all about the the science he's learned.",1359417600,2,236,4.488372093023256
3909988,5,B002D9OEUS,I bought this video specifically for the xylem and phloem song.  It is a great visual to compliment the material.  The kids liked it and I found myself singing the tunes in my head after showing it to the class.  I highly recommend this video.,1356652800,,243,4.355555555555555
3909989,4,B002D9OEUS,"I used this DVD in my fifth grade classroom.  It a great review of 4th and 5th grade California State Science standards.  I was worried that my students would find the old style computer graphics and corny jokes lame, but that was not the case.  The show really held their attention and the students sincerely enjoyed watching it.  I especially like the review test at the end.  It not only reviewed the concepts of Life Science, but also went over test taking stratigies.  I plan to show this and other Rock and Learn dvds in April to help prepare students for state testing in May.",1352419200,,583,4.504761904761905
3909990,4,B002D9OEUS,Have not reviewed the entire DVD but seems to be great for teaching young children. It is what I expected.,1334016000,,106,4.35
3909991,5,B002D9OEUS,"This DVD is a super review after a Life science curriculum, or as an introduction. If used as an introduction, I still recommend viewing it again after the year's study is completed. Older and younger elementary kids seem to like it (even though they will benefit from it very differently), and it helps to highlight a few key points. The online printables are a wonderful addition to this, too.",1332374400,,395,4.739130434782608
3909992,4,B002D9OEUS,This product is a good learning tool for first and second graders. The information was clear and easy to understand. It could have been better if some real kids were included instead of just cartoon figures.,1289433600,3,207,4.777777777777778
3909993,5,B002D9OEUS,"Excellent DVD. Cartoon base catches the attention of youngsters as small as 3-4, and the content is informative enough to teach all age ranges even adults. So, this reaches all age ranges. Its not something you want to see everyday, but maybe once a week or so and you will be amazed at what you may learn. Probably most ideal for ages 7-14, but both younger and older will learn from it. I have bought many of these rock 'n learn videos and I am happy with them all. Especially telling time! and all the science ones!!!!",1285804800,8,521,4.381443298969073
3909994,5,B002D9OEUS,"We have all of the Rock N Learn science DVD's and my kids love them all. The information is presented in a fun, yet accurate way that is easy for kids to process and remember. After watching the DVD's just a couple of times, the kids are able to recall almost all of the information. For example, after watching Earth Science three times, they were able to recall all of the planets (in order), the different types of rocks and the water cycle. These DVD's go beyond just helping the kids remember isolated facts - they are understanding how the information fits together. Out of all of the science videos, one (I can't remember which one...) had a statement that could be construed as evolutionary. We will definitely purchase any new science videos that Rock n Learn produces!",1262649600,15,778,4.644927536231884
3909995,5,B002D9OEUS,My 6 year old daughter loves it,1440892800,,31,3.5714285714285716
3909996,3,B002D9OEUS,"Kids complaint that the content is a bit boring and they expected there are more attractive photos and interesting experiments in this DVD. They are a bit disappointed but for me, I think the content is quite educational.",1439769600,,221,4.842105263157895

3909999,4,B002D9OEUS,"Ordered this for my media-focused kids to help reinforce some of the science we're learning at home. The singing plant grated on my nerves, but they were engaged and I'm always amazed at how much they retain from things like this they've watched!",1433030400,,246,4.744186046511628
3910000,5,B002D9OEUS,"I love this series. I teach Science. The only thing I hated was that they showed the animal cell being more peanut like and the books show them being a sphere. Sorta confuses the kids. Also, I'd bet on having a remote control. They'll REALLY BREAK THINGS DOWN and sometimes you don't need to hear allllll the specifics..",1428019200,,320,4.5344827586206895

3910002,5,B002D9OEUS,"My 6 yo is loving this video - she says she wants to be a scientist when she grows up. I almost didn't buy it for her since it says Grades 3-8, but she loves it! We're homeschooling and the Rock-N-Learn videos have been an awesome supplement.",1423008000,,242,4.170212765957447

3910007,5,B002D9OEUS,"Both of my kids loved this! They ask to watch it all of the time. My 4 year old explained the water cycle to me over dinner, after watching (in very simple terms, so he understood it). I am excited to check out some more of these videos.",1418169600,,237,3.9583333333333335
3910008,5,B002D9OEUS,I love all the Rock 'N Learn products. They're very useful for my homeschooled son.,1413936000,,83,4.6
3910009,5,B002D9OEUS,The kids love it.  I have a 6 and 9 yrs. old and they don't mind watching it at all.  I later found out that the teacher in 4 grad. had already introduced one of the DVD to my 9 yrs. old.,1407283200,,187,3.4285714285714284

3910011,5,B002D9OEUS,This is an excellent DVD.  I chose this video as a quick review on Life Science. I highly recommend this DVD.,1398643200,,109,4.190476190476191
3910012,5,B002D9OEUS,"I love all Rock N Learn videos. They are great learning tools and the kids really enjoy them! Each video is packed with information but they present it in a way that is fun. I recommend this video and others by Rock N Learn for all children, this would be a great tool for schools.",1384473600,,281,4.127272727272727
3910013,3,B002D9OEUS,Well we have several of these science rock and learn videos. The content is pretty decent - but the accent is a mess. Not sure why they would choose to have a thick fake accent to teach children words and information. Some of the words are pronounced differently on the video than Americans would speak it - so that is confusing for learning. & some of it the accent is so thick even I had to really concentrate to hear what word was being said.  Perhaps good for some children - but for any child with a learning disability I think it adds to the chaos.,1383091200,6,554,4.226415094339623
3910014,3,B002D9OEUS,My fourth graders didn't find this one as good as the others. The topics go more deep and it didn't cover topics that I wanted it to cover.,1367884800,,139,4.0
8364952,5,B002D9OEUS,"My kids love Rock'N'Learn DVDs.  We have several, and the great thing is that my younger ones loves watching the more complex material that I have purchased for my third grader, while my third grader still enjoys watching (and therefore reinforcing) material she has already mastered.

Also, when I'm teaching my children new concepts, I can easily sing or reference a quick clip from one of these videos to help reinforce any material I'm teaching them. Songs simply help concepts to ""stick."" A great learning supplement for both home-schoolers and traditionally-schooled children (we have both in our family).",1515283200,,611,5.224489795918367

8364955,1,B002D9OEUS,"The graphics terrible, voices hard to understand, and content was not presented in the most engaging way.  As a science teacher with a Biology major, I hated this show.  It does not really teach anything - only a review.  You cannot select which topic to review in the menu either so its one long run-on.  Not practical for classroom usage let alone for home usage - only for test prep if you can bear with it long enough to watch the entire thing.",1489708800,4,448,4.36144578313253
8364956,5,B002D9OEUS,Great video to introduce kids 5 and older to science. Was enjoyed by my gifted 8 and 5 yr olds.,1481328000,,95,3.8
