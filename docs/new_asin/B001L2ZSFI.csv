This movie is an excellent addition to my collection.  It has everything that a good movie needs: a good plot, action, drama and, unlike most movies these days, this one is suitable for the entire family.  I would recommend this movie for anyone looking to find a good movie to watch.",1289865600,11,458,4.416666666666667
3677626,4,B001L2ZSFI,A great strong family movie that teaches whats more important family or success.  Stephen Collins from 7th Heaven shows himself to be not just another tv star but a real actor with alot of depth and feeling. The rest of the cast captures your heart as well. A great plotline and a great movie for family viewing.,1245628800,18,312,4.473684210526316
3677627,5,B001L2ZSFI,"Looking for a movie for the entire family? Every Second Counts details the importance of families hanging in there, even when times are tough. It teaches the lesson that choices do have consequences...and they do make a difference. I would highly recommend this movie as it had no foul language and no objectional material - truly a rarity in today's movie world.

3677628,5,B001L2ZSFI,"Every Second Counts was such a heartwarming film! I enjoyed it the whole way through. The story of Brooke's dedication and the pressures from her father are very real.
