The sleeve artwork is very inferior to the actual animation when it comes to portraying characters, and there's no booklet or even special features. Even the DVD itself has no artwork and is only a solid color. Yet you do get 7 great episodes of the TV show, but I believe there was only 13 episodes so really a complete series set would've been easier. Now who knows if they'll release Vol. 2? (Just like how Disney just stops releasing cartoons like Gummi Bears, Gargoyles, The Tick, and other companies do that too with cartoons like Inspector Gadget, Count Duckula, and I'm still waiting for Silverhawks Vol. 2, and who knows if they'll ever release Season 3 of the newest Ninja Turtles cartoon)

As for the cartoon itself I'm glad some episodes I remembered were on this set, and here's a breakdown:

1. Sign Of The Dragon - Count Dracula's captured the team's werewolf, the current descendant of Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man!). The team has to rescue him from Dracula's clutches.

2. Stalking The Beast - The team makes a trip to Talbot's ancestral home to fight a werewolf problem and he hopes to find the werewolf who bit Larry Talbot in hopes of ending the family curse. This story gives a variation of the events of ""The Wolf Man"" (1941) in flashback sequences and the silver tipped wolf's head cane is intregal to the plot.

3. Immortality Of Evil - Count Dracula wants to use ancient Native American magic to gain true immortality unless the team stops him.

4. Return Of The Creature - A skeptic of the MOnster Force needs their help while trying to explore the ruins of a sunken city...because it's population of one is the Creature From The Black Lagoon!

5. Dark Deception - Meet Abraham Stoker (named after Bram Stoker), a vampire hunter of the classical sort who distrusts technology and prefers a wooden stake and a hammer! While Dracula's away from Transylvania the Monster Force take the oppurtunity to study records at a monastary before joining Stoker on a raid of Castle Dracula itself!

6. He Walks Again - Enter the Mummy! Im Ho-Tep is unleashed to do Dracula's bidding, but the Monster Force decides otherwise!

7. Dark City - Every 100 years it appears at a different location for one day, and then vanishes once again with the humans it lured into it's evil clutches!

The series was notable for using a modern descendant of the original Wolf Man as a hero alongside the Frankenstein Monster, a psychic, their leader the scientist Dr. Crawley, and two others who help fight monsters around the globe! Vol. 2 if and when they get around to it should have more memorable episodes of this unfortunately short lived series! Though, I think if it had a catchier theme song it might've lasted longer...action cartoons and instrumental theme songs don't go together that well, and the theme is boring and not very memorable.",1255737600,4,3013,4.648496240601504

8366101,5,B002DUJ9MA,"Being a fan of the Universal Monsters, it was great to see them get their own cartoon.

And they do have a pretty interesting storyline for a children's cartoon.

It is great to finally be able to watch these cartoons again, even if we only get 7 episodes instead of the entire 13 episode run.",1424304000,,293,4.3090909090909095
8366102,3,B002DUJ9MA,There are no special feature to this DVD.  That's kind of a drag considering the concept for this show was pretty fun.  It would have been great to see concept art or storyboards or commentary tracks.  I would have taken a commercial or two from the toy line in the extras.  There was enough of a suggested back story for this show to run 3 seasons or more but...  alas.  I remember there were action figures tied in with this show..(that's where the real money is at).  If a volume 2 ever gets released I'll get it to complete the set.  This is good if you're just looking to flesh out those nostalgic memories of this show.  Cheers!,1420761600,,634,4.305084745762712
8366103,4,B002DUJ9MA,"An instant classic for 90's animation fans.
Very recommended.",1414368000,,61,5.888888888888889
8366104,5,B002DUJ9MA,"I had NEVER seen or heard of Monster Force before, being a huge fan of Universal Monster movie's of the 1930's and 1940's as well as 1980's The Monster Squad and I even enjoyed 2004's Van Helsing starring Hugh Jackman, so I HAD to at least give this a shot, I was hesitant and unsure, it really didn't look all that good and didn't last long at all on TV, one season in fact. So I started this this morning and finished it this evening, and my verdict is this..... This is one the the greatest animated show's I have ever seen, especially of it's kind, as far as animated monster shows go, it is one of a kind! This show is truly PERFECT! The only thing I hate is that this was a COMPLETE season, only a single volume with no second one in sight! A dang shame! This deserved proper treatment! I HIGHLY recommend this to any fans of Universal monster movie's like I am and just fans of 80's and 90's animated action shows! These are the coolest animated monsters that I have EVER and probably will ever see! Dracula is perfect, absolutely Dracula, not played for laughs or incompetent like so many villains in very well known shows were, Frankenstein's Monster is a good guy and is really cool looking too and Dracula and Frankenstein even go head-to-head at one point! The Wolfman is a good guy and while not the coolest looking of the werewolves it is because he is a good guy, the other werewolves are super killer looking! My biggest concern was The Mummy which looked stupid on the cover, but actually he was pretty cool! The Creature from the Black Lagoon episode is the best Creature from the Black Lagoon anything that I have ever seen! There are also other vampires, werewolves, zombies, killer vampire skeletons, and other monsters! This show is so kick-butt man! An absolute blast! This show is not the usual predictable kind and really is of better quality in story, and the voice acting is great, the heroes are cool and have really cool gadgets too, I cannot recommend this show enough, buy it now! Please release Volume Two guys, PLEASE!

Monster Force: Volume One ***** out of *****

8366106,4,B002DUJ9MA,"Loved the series, but was disappointed that Universal could not make this a complete series. It is amazing that it has been over 3 years and they still have not released the rest of the series.",1362873600,,193,4.388888888888889
8366107,5,B002DUJ9MA,"I remember this series when I was younger and it brought back some good memories, plus the stories in some of the episodes could make some really good movies some day in the future.  They are original, and give the universal monsters the respect they deserve. Better yet make a present day version/update of this series now that would be cool.",1256601600,2,343,4.622950819672131
