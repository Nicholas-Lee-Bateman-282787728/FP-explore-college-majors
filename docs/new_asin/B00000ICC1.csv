1220832,1,B00000ICC1,"Everyone should know that if you already have Back Street Stories, don't buy this video. It is a waste of money.  It is exactly the same as Back Street Stories, except it has an American narrator instead of a British  one.  So, I guess it makes this video better than the other one if you  don't want to hear that thick British accent.  I was really  disappointed about the video because for most of it, other people are being  interviewed, not the Boys.  Also, the interviews with the Boys are really  short and they basically say things that any BSB fan already knows.  The  only thing good/interesting about the video is that it shows footage of  them when they were just starting out, (Nick was soooo young!).",944611200,46,713,4.52755905511811

7909969,5,B00000ICC1,I have this vhs from way back when. Love BSB but sad because I no longer have a VHS player and cannot watch it. Any one know where I can purchase this on dvd or blu ray format?,1429056000,,176,3.6578947368421053
7909970,1,B00000ICC1,The clips on this video are good the only problem is that on the copy that I received there was no sound. Plus the picture quality was BAD! I would not recommend this video. As far as I can tell all of the footage is also available on the VHS Backstreet Boys: The Video. I would recommend buying that one instead.,1016323200,,313,4.147540983606557
7909971,5,B00000ICC1,This video was really awesome! I love how it has videos that us American fans never got to see. (...)It's a really great video!,1004486400,,127,4.333333333333333
7909972,4,B00000ICC1,I liked this video cause it had stuff from Eurpore that of course me (being an american fan)would have never seen!!I loved this video.,969580800,,134,4.625
7909973,2,B00000ICC1,"I bought this video a few Months ago and was disappointed, but yet I wasn't. I enjoyed seeing the boys young, and was really happy to see Kevin being silly, because now he seem a little up tight. I thought it should  have had more interviews with the guys, or at least showed more scenes with  them. It was also a little hard to understand what the narrator was saying,  because she was English: so If your going to buy it, buy the one with the  Amercian narrator. I have only watched this BSB video once, because it  wasn't that great, but if your a collector of BSB material than buy it. If  you want a video that shows the boys than don't buy it. It's up to you!",957571200,12,665,4.116279069767442
7909974,3,B00000ICC1,"I really enjoyed and loved seeing the videos for five of their songs.  The only complaints I have is the use of coloring for the interview parts.  I mean, one minute, everything's all blue, next minute everything's all  yellow.  The constant change of colors made it difficult to concentrate on  watching their interviews, and made my eyes hurt after awhile.",956793600,,358,4.9
7909975,4,B00000ICC1,"this was a great video and it is perfect for any fan who enjoys bsb. this is an older video (1996) and is european. it shows the making of their european video anywhere for you and it also shows the videos for get down,  quit playin games and the other version of i'll never break you heart. it  has a few live performances and clips from mtv europe. this is a wonderful  video, but i wish it was longer... only 55 min.",951091200,11,419,4.085365853658536
7909976,4,B00000ICC1,"This is a cool video I luv seeing the guys when they where young it's funny seeing that & seeing them picking on each other (especially nick) & interviews on people who know & work with them, the only problem  is there's too much talking but I enjoyed it well though.",946339200,9,267,4.235294117647059
