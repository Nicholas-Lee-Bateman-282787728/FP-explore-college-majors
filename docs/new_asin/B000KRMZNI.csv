8158809,3,B000KRMZNI,"I thought I was buying the TV Series, ""Up Pompeii"", but that's not what this is.  It's a movie based off the TV series.

If you've seen the TV series, I don't think that this movie is as funny as that.  There are a number of scenes with exposed women's breasts.  This definitely was never shown on American TV.

I've only watched part of the second move ""Up The Chastity Belt"" but it seems about the same.  Lurkio is now Sir Lurk-a-Lot and he is a servant...same basic premise with different scenery and different supporting characters.  This takes place in England during the reign of King Richard.

I don't have a region 2 DVD player and since you're only allowed to change regions about four times.  I didn't want to change and then change it back.  The way I was able to watch this was with ""WinX DVD Ripper Platinum""  [...] which was able to read the DVD and rip it to a file.  Once I have that file I can watch the file or burn it to a DVD if I needed to.

I was going to use ""DVD Decrypter"" to create an ISO image and then play that using MagicDisk and RIP it from there.  I think that will work too (and those two programs are free) but I haven't tried that with a region 2 DVD, since I was able to RIP the file with ""Winx DVD Ripper Platinum"".

I'm not sure that I'm going to keep any of it.  It's not worth watching a second time.

I think Frankie Howerd was best when he was interacting with a live audience and he didn't have that for either of these movies.",1347667200,2,1470,4.119718309859155
