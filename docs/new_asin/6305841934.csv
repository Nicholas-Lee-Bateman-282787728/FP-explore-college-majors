I remember when I first saw this in the movie theatre,  and I just fell in love with both actresses.  I am quite a movie buff, and  I just can't say enough about this movie.

1084316,5,6305841934,"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO AUNT ALICE (1969) Dir:  LEE H KATZIN Stars;  Geraldine Page, Ruth Gordon, Mildred Dunnock, Rosemary Forsyth, Robert Fuller
Superlative campy thriller, brilliantly acted by its main  protagonists. The fantastic Geraldine Page stars as a psychotic widow with  a penchant for growing the very sturdiest and handsome of Pine trees - her  secret is human fertiliser in the form of a series of butchered companions.  Slowly suspicion rises and a friend of one of the deceased, now fertiliser  fodder, begins to catch on to Page's dastardly deeds.
Geraldine Page  delivers a tour de force performance as Claire Marrable - oozing a charming  menace and evil with every breath. Yet there are severe undertones of  humour and one senses that the actors involved would have a good cackle  after every take. Page's performance rates with the most vintage camp EVER.  She obviously relished and thoroughly enjoyed the role.
Ruth Gordon, best  remembered from the wonderful Harold and Maude, delivers a typically feisty  and spunky performance as the Aunt Alice of the title. It is vintage stuff  and works equally successfully as a taut thriller but best of all as the  blackest and most wicked of comedies.  Please also appreciate the totally  schizo music score that is so appropriate for the film. A gem from director  Lee H. Katzin and producer Robert Aldrich who gave us another cult  favourite, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.",961891200,8,1440,5.072649572649572
1084365,4,6305841934,"In the early 1960s director Robert Aldrich teamed aging stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in a suspense thriller called ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" The movie was a smash hit. Two or three years later he brought the two actresses back for ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"". Crawford dropped out and was replaced by Olivia De Havilland. Again, Aldrich struck pay dirt. In 1969 his production company made yet another such movie, ""Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice?"", starring Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon. This was directed by Lee H. Katzin. I don't think it was as successful at the boxoffice, but the important thing is that Alice is almost as much fun as Jane and Charlotte.
Page plays Claire, a woman of sixty or so. In the opening scenes she finds out that her recently deceased husband left her with virtually nothing. Furious because her grand lifestyle has ended, Claire moves to the American Southwest, where she cooks up a scheme. She hires timid little old lady housekeepers and, over time, convinces them that she can make them a lot of money in the stock market. Once an unsuspecting employee turns over her life savings, Claire kills her and buries her in her garden, marking each grave with a new pine tree. Soon the yard is filled with trees. One day a new housekeeper named Alice [Ruth Gordon] shows up. Alice, however, has an ulterior motive. One of the women was her friend, and Alice suspects that Claire is responsible for her disappearance. Thus begins a grand game of cat and mouse.
Unlike Davis and Crawford, Page and Gordon were not movie stars fallen on hard times. They were great character actresses with extensive stage experience. Both had had an occasional starring role in films but had played mostly supporting roles over the years. They were older but hardly faded. If anything, they were at the height of their popularity when they made ""Alice"". They are the reason the movie, otherwise an outlandish melodrama, is still worth seeing. Gordon is outrageous fun as Alice, playing the part with true professionalism, yet barely able to conceal her glee and amusement at being in such a movie. But it is Page who dominates throughout. Her Claire is both hilarious and sad. Sometimes she stalks, sometimes she slithers through the movie, reminding one of a cross between a leopard and a cobra. She's obviously having a grand time.
Other Geraldine Page movies I particularly like are ""Summer and Smoke"", ""The Trip to Bountiful"" and ""Sweet Bird of Youth"". Great Ruth Gordon movies include ""Harold and Maude"", ""Where's Poppa?"" and, of course, ""Rosemary's Baby"".",1024617600,25,2590,4.888636363636364
1084366,4,6305841934,"While the movie certainly belongs to Geraladine Page and Ruth Gordon, I watched it because Robert Fuller was in it.  And believe me, he's never looked better. I always liked him in Laramie and Wagon Train, and was delighted to see him in a non-cowboy role.  Everybody else was pretty much over the top, but I'd watch it for him any day!",1005955200,,336,4.403225806451613
1084367,5,6305841934,"Don't let the title fool you. This is not a parody of WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?. AUNT ALICE is its own little film, and what a nifty one it is. The great Geraldine Page stars as Mrs. Marrable, a widow whose husband left her only a stamp album. Unable(and unwilling) to cope with poverty, Mrs. Marrable is able to live up to her station by devising a plan that consists of hiring-then murdering housekeepers for their private incomes. The plan works very well until Mrs. Marrable makes the mistake of eliminating wispy Miss Tinsley(Mildred Dunnock) whose feisty friend, Mrs. Dimmock(the delightful Ruth Gordon), promptly applies for a position at the Marrable residence in order to solve this bizarre missing-persons mystery. Theodore Apstein's script(based on the novel 'The Forbidden Garden' by Ursula Curtiss) is a superlative mixture of spine-tingling suspense and dark comedy. The supporting cast performs competently enough, but the film ultimately belongs to Page and Gordon who both turn in positively flawless portrayals. The DVD is an absolute must for collectors. DVD lovers may at first be put off by the lack of extra material on this particular release, but it does include the original theatrical trailer(which isn't included on the VHS release), and the film itself never looked better. Highly recommended!",1001894400,6,1328,5.181395348837209
1084368,5,6305841934,"Geraldine Page is one of the greatest actresses of our time. This movie, paradoxically, perhaps demonstrates this better than her more ""serious"" work such as ""Sweet Bird of Youth,"" ""Summer and Smoke"" and ""Interiors"" because SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON INVOLVED WITH THIS MOVIE WHO HAS A SHRED OF TALENT (besides Mildred Dunnock, whose role is too small to help). In the other movies I mention, Page is in the company of talented actors and directors; in this movie, she's surrounded by a complete lack of talent and/or ability. Page gives a spectacularly wonderful performance and a witty characterization that is altogether astonishing in the midst of so much bad acting and directing. THE ACTING STINKS, STINKS, STINKS EXCEPT FOR PAGE. Ruth Gordon was always a ham, and she is here too. Still, she presents enough of a character for Page to work against. The music score is ridiculously overbearing, inappropriate, hysterical and maudlin, sometimes all at the same time. My copy of the DVD has the worst sound of any DVD in my collection. The voices are tinny, weak and distant, while the scritching violins are in your face, along with every telephone ring and every other unimportant sound effect. Clearly Anchor Bay or whoever is responsible for producing the DVD botched the entire sound process. The best scene in the movie is with Page and the dog. This is because Page is the only one with lines in this scene, and she shows how she can rise above the tawdriness of the production and the (lack of) direction. Still, even her purring-est, steeliest, scorching line readings barely make it past the ""music."" I've waited for years to own this performance, and I'm grateful that I can see Geraldine Page at the height of her powers (but, then, when wasn't she?), but I'm disgusted by the low production values of the DVD presentation (not to mention of the movie itself). The voices at times literally buzz with distortion. Unless you're an admirer of Geraldine Page, stay away. If you do appreciate her, however, it's definitely worth putting up with all the garbage around her. Fortunately, the DVD has chapter stops, so you can skip a lot of the muck. My recommendation: press the forward-scan button every second Page is not onscreen. But you might be tempted to scan backwards and watch Page again and again as she gets a chance to do her thing, which is great character work and an astonishing variety and depth of emotion. I look forward to quality DVD releases of ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" and ""Summer and Smoke"" in particular, but Geraldine Page is virtually flawless in everything she ever did.",999993600,,2600,4.831838565022421
1084369,5,6305841934,"Geraldine Page is the champion scenery chewer of all time and ""Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice"" gives her a role to really chew. She gets to go over the top as a middle aged widow who hires old lady companions then kills them for their life savings. She gets to rage, go mad, murder and wear a horrendous fright wig that will thrill any fan of middle aged actresses in lurid question asking horror movies.",998006400,,405,4.413333333333333
1084370,5,6305841934,"Anchor Bay is a wonderful company, releasing some truly demented little gems on high-quality DVD's for demented little viewers like me.
This is one of the best of the ""Star slumming in b-movie guignol"" you can find- it's well paced, well written and fantastically well acted by Geraldine Page (the scene where she tries to kill the dog is amazing) and Ruth Gordon.  Nobody in the movie is truly who they seem, except the nice young woman next door, and I am not going to tell you one more thing.  Go get this movie right now- you'll have a blast!",986774400,2,546,4.45
1084371,3,6305841934,"The original poster of this movie really stayed in my memory! Even though I was four when the film first came out, I remember my family talking about the plot of murders and people buried in the garden. Over the years, I'd seen parts of it on TV, but finally broke down and bought a copy of the video. Definitely worth the money!  While it's not the scariest movie I've ever seen, the premise is pretty creepy, not to mention macabre! I LOVED Geraldine Page's cackle sewn throughout the film; that really added a campy twist. All the acting was fine, and for an addition to the 'Baby Jane' genre, 'Aunt Alice' definitely holds its own!",986256000,3,635,4.474137931034483

1084373,4,6305841934,"Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon are the formidable females of this Gothic  ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""/Hush...Hush, Sweet  Charlotte"" spin-off. Page is an Arizona widow who maintains her very  comfortable lifestyle by murdering her housekeepers and appropriating their  savings. Gordon is a tough amateur sleuth who hires on as her next victim  in hopes of getting to the bottom of missing persons mystery. A very fine,  entertaining tale of suspense. I dare say it's more than a little  farfetched at times, but the strong performances by the veteran leading  ladies are always believable and make the film reach the pinnacle of art.  The newly restored, widescreen edition from Anchor Bay is absolutely  flawless and is a must!!!!!",968803200,2,739,5.186440677966102
1084374,5,6305841934,"I vividly remember seeing this little flick back in 1969 when it was originally released theatrically and I found it much more enjoyable than the supposedly ""bigger"" movie of the double feature. The acting of Gordon (she's not especially eccentric in this) and Dunnock is first-rate as usual yet it's Page who has a field day in her incredible tour de force interpretation of the murderous middle-aged Mrs. Marrable. Scenes which linger in the memory are many: when Page catches Gordon combing out her wig collection, Marrable winning a contest (she discovers this one evening while tipsy & opening her mail), a scene has Page tear into Gordon ""Did I say you could help yourself? "" after Ruthie's poured herself a brandy; there's the ""Gordon dumping scene"" and the ironic ending which concerns postage stamps. I'm so glad this little gem has found it's way to video; Geraldine Page was surely one of the finest actresses to grace the stage and screen; her acting is a fascinating joy to behold!",966038400,8,994,4.852941176470588

A throwback to the 60's with the clothes, hairdos and cars. Gerald Fried's score fits perfectly with the movie also. It's a game of cat and mouse between a seemingly penniless widow and her housekeeper.  Who wins and who loses?  YOU need to watch to find out.  Superb classic acting by Geraldine Page as Mrs. Marrable and Ruth Gordon as Mrs. Dimmick.",1386720000,,483,4.569767441860465
7896619,4,6305841934,"Not-so-grieving widow Claire Marrable is horrified to hear that her supposedly wealthy husband has apparently left her penniless. But, being a practical (and resourceful) type, she hits on a scheme to keep her in the comfort to which she wishes to become accustomed. Relocating to the Arizona desert, she hires elderly housekeepers with no known relatives (but tidy nest eggs) and sends them to their rewards a bit sooner than they planned. And their remains become mulch for the widow's growing garden as each is buried under a quickly flourishing sapling. This later entry in the ""horror hag"" sweepstakes features absolutely wonderful performances from Geraldine Page, who has a high old time as the haughty, demented and thoroughly relentless Mrs. Marrable, and Ruth Gordon, as Alice Dimmock, her new housekeeper, who isn't quite what she seems to be. On the sidelines are Rosemary Forsyth, herself a (young) widow with a nephew, Robert Fuller as Miss Gordon's nephew, and Joan Huntington as the scheming wife of Page's nephew. With a cast made up of widows and nephews, how scary can ""Aunt Alice"" be? Not very. But it's a delicious black comedy which allows Page and Gordon the opportunity to give the performances of their lives. There's also a neat cameo from Mildred Dunnock (""Death Of A Salesman"") as the luckless servant who precedes Miss Gordon. One of the best ""Grand Guignol"" films ever made!

7896620,4,6305841934,"The MGM DVD re-release sees little extras other than being in widescreen.  No matter, this film is deliciously wicked.

7896621,4,6305841934,"Aunt Alice is really an oddity in some ways.  Baby Jane and Charlotte were first of course and both had their moments, but  the camp scale is upped a bit here due to the way the mod, ultra-cool early 70's sets and clothing look to the viewer  today.  Page is wild here:  creepy and scary at one moment and then hillariously funny the next.  Gordon is all plucky determination as she investiagtes the mystery of Page's character.  Together, they are a delight to watch as they spa and smack each other with equal glee.  Great fun.",1092960000,6,529,4.4375
7896622,4,6305841934,"Claire Marrable, a destitute widow, finds a way to keep herself living the good life by hiring a series of housekeepers whom she eventually murders, steals their life savings and buries them in her desert pine tree garden. An incredibly fun movie which derives pleasure from the lead actors. Geraldine Page (as Mrs. Marrable) and Ruth Gordon (as Alice Dimmock, the latest housekeeper who is actually trying to find out what happened to her friend who mysteriously vanished while working for Marrable) chew the scenery to the hilt and it is so much fun watching the interactions between the two. Watch Page's reaction when Gordon tells her the amount in her savings account - priceless! The film as a whole suffers somewhat from some dull supporting characters and a dreary romantic sub-plot involving Gordon's nephew and Page's neighbor. Still worth it for the acting dynamo of  Page and Gordon and even Mildred Dunnock manages some nice moments in her few scenes. And you'll never forget the frenetic zither music score!
The quality of the dvd is very good. The picture is sharp and the colors are strong. The only extra feature is a trailer for the film which delivers the memorable tag-line - ""Whatever happened to Aunt Alice is more terrifying than what happened to Baby Jane""!",1074643200,39,1281,4.903225806451613
7896623,5,6305841934,"They do not make movies like this anymore. Geraldine Page plays a nutcase hell bent on murdering every housekeeper that comes to work for her. What makes it so memorable is how she discards of the bodies (I won't give anything away here). Also adding effect is the spectacular music. Ruth Gordon joins the cast as a housekeeper trying to catch her out. Bad move Ruth.
While this film might seem dated to many, no moviegoer can argue the brilliant acting and suspense. An all round favourite.",1061251200,7,491,4.655172413793103
7896624,4,6305841934,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE, IT IS HIGH CAMP, FUNNY AND BLACKLY HORRIFYING ALL AT THE SAME TIME. BOTH GERALDINE PAGE AND RUTH GORDON HAVE FUN WITH THEIR ROLES, ESPECIALLY THE FORMER, USING HER FACIAL EXPRESSIONS TO THE HILT, ROLLING HER EYES AND INFLECTING A SARCASTIC TONE INTO HER VOICE. RUTH GORDON, IF MORE RESERVED, IS JUST AS GOOD, AND VERY DIFFERENT THAN IN ROSEMARY'S BABY, SHE SEEMS REFRESHINGLY SANE IN THIS. THE PLOT MOVES ALONG AT A FAST BUT ENJOYABLE SPEED, WITH ONE OR TWO RED HERRINGS  A LONG THE WAY. IF YOU LIKE PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERS, A WITTY SCRIPT AND GOOD ACTING, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE. I RECOND HITCHOCK WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT TOO.",1047600000,2,649,4.643478260869565
7896625,5,6305841934,"Anchor Bay is to be graciously commended for delivering this delicious concoction to DVD. A very black murder tale is marvelously enacted by two top ladies of the old school of acting---Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon. They are perfectly matched in a deadly cat & mouse game that is one of the most entertaining films of it's kind. Page is left high & dry (she thinks) after her husband passes on so she moves to Arizona to make the best of it. However, her lifestyle is not to be denied as she carries out a wicked plan to supplement her modest income. What follows is a series of ""companions"" who mysteriouly disappear after allowing Page to ""invest"" their savings. Meanwhile, new pine trees keep popping up around her house. This is where Gordon comes in as she hires on to be the next companion. Actually on the trail of a friend who vanished while employed with Page, she has to match wits with the devious woman while trying to keep one step ahead of her at all times. The two Grande Dames go at it in high style and the viewer can just sit back and enjoy. Rosemary Forsyth co-stars as a new neighbor with a small son and a dog who runs afoul of Page and suspects something is wrong. The scene with Page trying to kill the dog (who just won't cooperate) is an amusing highlight. A most enjoyable thriller and very recommended---especially for fans of Page and Gordon.",1032048000,2,1372,4.47011952191235
