The artist is true to himself and real in his relationships as you enjoy his dialogue with himself and his wife.  Their commitment to each other is heart-warming and beautiful.  Most documentaries run long for me even when they're only an hour but not so with The Cardboard Bernini.  I couldn't wait to see what would become of his phenomenal creation out of cardboard.  A MUST SEE for any lover of art and life!!!",1362441600,,533,4.568421052631579

5622784,1,B00BI7Z78E,"Love the artist, absolutely hated this documentary -- what I could watch of it, that is.  The cinematography was so bad that this film was simply unwatchable.  We've all become accustomed to the ""found footage"" films with the shaky, hand-held camera cinematography, so for this to be unwatchable, a new level of terrible filmmaking has been achieved.  I was literally nauseous after 5 minutes.

I don't like to low-rate documentaries since they are generally filmed with low budgets and feature wonderful topics; however, this is the exception.  I tried, twice, to get through more than 20 minutes of this film and simply couldn't stomach it.  What a shame.",1461715200,,657,5.037037037037037

5622804,5,B00BI7Z78E,"To watch other artists at work usually gives a window of a short how to on their approach to problem solving, which fascinates me. What wasn't expected was the insight to the very spark that drives the artist. It evolves slowly throughout the documentary, giving youthful beginnings up until the actual moment of realizing a life-long drive to the inevitable end. It startled me, shook me but gave me an understanding of how the glorious act of creativity sometimes resolves itself. It is about the art work, true, but how it came to be; the support of a rock solid partner, a life lived in love and humor and away from false bravado and the limelight, and an unswerving focus on the creation. Just watch it. You won't be disappointed.",1430956800,2,735,4.661538461538462

5622811,5,B00BI7Z78E,"The Cardboard Bernini is a film that I will never be able to get out of my head, and I wouldn't want to. The story follows the creation and destruction of James Grashow's cardboard rendition of the Bernini Fountain in Italy, with behind the scenes footage of Grashow's intricate artistic methods, interviews with friends and family, and constant insights into his wise and honest thoughts.  Director Olympia Stone coaxes her audience to ask every important question that humans have ever asked: Why create? Why are we here? What's the meaning? Am I afraid? What is death? What is love?  And although the answers will never be concrete (or even cardboard) Stone and Grashow leave you filled with wonder, gratitude, and appreciation of the unknown.",1374451200,2,746,5.008064516129032
5622812,5,B00BI7Z78E,amazing film about the creative process and a philosophy of the circle of life! Listening to Jimmy describe his vision of life and art was thought provoking as well as moving!,1372204800,,175,4.67741935483871
5622813,5,B00BI7Z78E,"In documenting the creation (and destruction) of James Grashaw's cardboard fountain modeled after one of Bernini's, filmmaker Olympia Stone takes viewers on a journey through and beyond the artistic process. Jimmy is such an incredibly open and articulate subject. We quickly realize this is not just a film about art, creativity, or even the realization a particular project, but rather a more universal tale of the human spirit. This documentary is about life and death, joy and despair, the past and the future, an individual and relationships. At the center of the film is the fountain -- a monumental project made from pedestrian materials -- which achieves ""success"" in museum settings before its planned dissolution in the rain. It is easy to make the connection between the life cycle of the work of art and our own mortality. What is extraordinary about the film is how knowing what is to come does nothing to diminish the range of emotions we feel as we get to know Jimmy as an artist, a husband, a father, and a human being over several years of interviews. The film is a beautiful, intimate portrait of an artist. It is also a work of art, and like all the best ones it reminds us what we know about life and invites us to feel deeply.",1370995200,,1247,4.672727272727273
5622814,5,B00BI7Z78E,"My first viewing of The Cardboard Bernini was at the REEL Independent Film Extravaganza last October. To me, Jimmy Grashow's creation of a cardboard Trevi fountain - and Olympia Stone's film about that creation - seem as monumental as the original Trevi fountain. The film is about the impermanence of existence and about people who create (showing how the mind of an artist sees the world and makes sense of existence) and yet the film says so much more; it weaves the threads of life into a beautiful dense rich cloth: both magical and of the world.

I felt my own mortality made visible, and I felt exposed. The film depicts a life cycle. I was riveted both visually and emotionally....I could not take my eyes away from the screen for the entire 76 minutes of running time. I sat in silence, an internal space  of deep appreciation for the creation of something so great and expansive.

The project began in 2007, and this is where the film begins. We are introduced to James Grashow, and right from the start he has you. He speaks about his work which mirrors life, its fragility and impermanence. He shares with us why he chooses to work in cardboard. For Jimmy, cardboard aspires to be more and tends to be forgiving and malleable, perhaps like people. He talks about needing to make the Trevi Fountain, to construct it (giving incredible attention to detail like fish scales and some elements that most people would never see) and to show it (it was ultimately shown at The Taubman Museum in Richmond, Virginia - usually the final step for most artists)....and yet Grashow wants to see the work through to the next stage..the one most artists don't think about: the works ultimate demise.  Which in this case takes us to the outdoor patio of the Aldrich Museum of Art in Connecticut.

I  love the way Grashows family is woven throughout the film, showing its paramount place in his life. He is an incredibly self aware person, one who is loving, deeply conscious on all levels, and incredibly gifted. And the rhythms of the score mirror the creative process and caused me to feel like I was participating in the creative process with Jimmy.

Olympia Stone provides a stunning, provocative, and sublime ending and every time I see the film I am deeply moved. Her vision and Grashows stimulate me to see the world and understand it in a slightly different way each time.",1369094400,,2376,4.683453237410072
5622815,5,B00BI7Z78E,"The Cardboard Bernini is so much more than a film about art or an artist.  It's about growing old while remaining passionate about ones desires to accomplish the unthinkable. Through laughter, tears and self-realization, we learn what drives a man to his ultimate goal.  This film speaks to something many of us fear, death, the final chapter, while exploring how this ultimate end affects those closest to us.  The Cardboard Bernini is about life and the fragility of one's soul and the relationships we form as we navigate the decades spent on earth. The idea of creating a film where perishable cardboard grows in to a magnificent series of interconnected sculptures serves as a dynamic and thought provoking metaphor for our own mortality, and it's a brilliant move on the filmmakers part to take audiences in this direction.",1364342400,5,829,4.992753623188406
5622816,5,B00BI7Z78E,"The film follows the creative arc of an epic project from beginning to end, offering us an intimate look into the life, studio and workings of an extremely generous and multi-talented artist. Jimmy Grashow is master of his material as he magically transforms humble cardboard and glue into classical mythic figures long venerated in the art world. From deeply troubling issues to colorfully humorous anecdotes, from historic photos to close-up detail shots of the artist's hands at work, all play their parts in this celebration, as we are led up to the inevitable dramatic finale. Fascinating, heartfelt and touching.",1364169600,,618,5.252525252525253
5622817,5,B00BI7Z78E,"I was surprised and delighted by the documentary.
It's a quirky and moving meditation about the meaning of art, love and mortality.",1362700800,,131,5.0
5622818,5,B00BI7Z78E,"Jimmy Grashow is more than an artist - he's a philosopher, a comedian, a sage, a teacher, and a completely mesmerizing screen presence.  Olympia Stone so wisely let him - and his work - speak for him/itself in ""The Cardboard Bernini:"" the result is a spellbinding trip with Jimmy through the multi-year process of the creation and disintegration of his beyond-intricate, gorgeous cardboard fountain.  I was by turns impressed, intrigued, horrified, amused, and inspired - and I don't think I took a breath during the entire film.  It's genius!",1362614400,6,543,5.078651685393258
5622819,5,B00BI7Z78E,"This is an amazing documentary. One part love story and one part eulogy, the film tells the story of artist Jimmy Grashow's elaborate fountain made out of cardboard. ""You can judge an artist by his medium,"" jokes Grashow, who has the film presence of the greatest actors. ""My medium is cardboard."" The film touches on ideas of mortality, creativity, despair, redemption, love, and luck. I brought 4 friends to a screening, and we all laughed loudly and loved the story of the fountain that couldn't hold water. We knew each other better for watching it together, and spent an hour after the film deep in conversation in the theater parking lot. Buy it. Watch it. Share it. You'll enjoy it.",1362528000,2,689,4.75
5622820,5,B00BI7Z78E,"The Cardboard Bernini

I have always regarded sidewalk artists as brave. The very good ones. They release their creations to the elements in what seems an heroic gesture of defiance. Wind, rain, snow and public foot traffic soon distort and destroy the original statement, leaving only the de-contextualized remnants to speak for their creator.
""The Cardboard Bernini"" may be the grandest of such wonders. In both scale and skill, it certainly is a finalist, as portrayed in Olympia Stone's deft and highly entertaining eponymous film. James Grashow has been amusing and dazzling the art world for decades with his stunning woodblocks, papier mache, fabric and cardboard creations. Some of the most iconic record albums of the 60s and 70s bear his stamp along with numerous woodblocks published in leading newspapers across the country during those years. Grashow could have made a career as an illustrator, but then, he wouldn't be the prodigious artist he is today.
I first became aware of his razor-honed sense of humor several decades ago, when I saw an exhibit of ""House Plants"" at the renowned Allan Stone Gallery on the upper east side of New York. Comprised entirely of cardboard, they blossomed with detailed, brilliantly-colored, miniature houses at the end of their stalks. Pun intended! Over the years, Grashow has continued to explore the limits of his imagination, an odyssey which, hopefully, will never come to an end, at least in my lifetime.
Ms. Stone's film follows the artist from his initial impulse to create, then intentionally desecrate, his own work. And what a piece of work he has chosen-- Bernini's wonder, The Trevi Fountain! Grashow tells of his inspiration, which grew from his initial horror at seeing some of his work dissolving in the limbs of a tree at Allan Stone's suburban home. Recovering from the shock, he saw something unexpectedly magical in the decomposed figures he had created several years before.
Few artists I have ever heard of hold such reverence for paper, especially cardboard, as does Grashow. It is a medium of endless possibilities in his hands, and we watch with amazement as he slices, bends, and pastes his myriad elements of Bernini's colossus together. All the while, we sense an ongoing ambivalence in Grashow's decision
to offer the finished work to a museum that will agree to its slow demolition by weather. His wife, friends, fellow artists, all plead with him to re-consider this decision. The enormity of the piece itself, combined with the days, months, years of its creation, build to a climax worthy of its inspiration. Fortunately for us all, the journey is beautifully and respectfully preserved in this excellent film.

The artist profiled, Jimmy Grashow, is so brilliant and sweet and wise and charming. I could listen to him talk forever. Watching him work is a joy. Seeing how the film ends is heart-breaking but life-affirming. The film is so rich, I could watch Carboard Bernini again and again and get something new from it. This is a beautiful film.

8568943,5,B00BI7Z78E,"Thank you for bringing this artist to my attention.  I personally had never heard of him before.  Though truth be known, I actually cried...like his wife...when he let it all disintegrate and was panicked throughout the film knowing this was his end goal.  As an artist of sorts myself, I do understand what he was trying to do, but I have to say...I don't agree with it.  For many struggling artists...myself included...to have the kind of talent that allows you to be able to create such an amazing piece and allow others to enjoy it should, in fact, be the goal.  Understanding the artist's personal journey, I do understand that the need for him to allow it to be destroyed is certainly his choice.  But I grieve for those who will never know the greatness of his talents by experiencing it for themselves.  I hope he has gotten that out of his system.",1488326400,,856,4.555555555555555
