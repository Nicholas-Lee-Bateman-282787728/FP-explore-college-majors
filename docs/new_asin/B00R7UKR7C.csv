6901813,5,B00R7UKR7C,"I really love The Fall and was wanting season 2. I actually already had season one, but the package for season 1 & 2 was $10 cheaper than simply buying just season 2. Go figure. I know you can watch it on Netflix, which I have. But it was one of the shows I wanted my own copy of.

In any case, the video and audio were excellent quality. There were two special feature interviews and deleted scenes. In warning, this was from the UK. I have a region free DVD player so I can watch it in the US. If you don't, you won't be able to buy the seasons to watch until they are released on Amazon in the US.",1425254400,15,600,3.918032786885246

An examination of sexual predator, which is framed against the locale of, post-Troubles Belfast. This is Where a cop has to deal with sectarian riots outside a murder scene. In addition, where a serial killer's painstaking plans can be confounded by Loyalist thugs?

Dornan plays Paul Spector grief counsellor, former Samaritans voluntary helper and serial killer who is terrorising the city of Belfast. This series revolves around a PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) investigation in Belfast into a string of Murders. Detective Superintendent Gibson played by Gillian Anderson, who is on secondment from London's Metropolitan Police Service, heads the police investigation. This is a gripping cat-and-mouse series, where Dornan plays an intelligent, articulate - but deeply flawed character who gives into his deep dark desires, yet his misogyny seems rather selective or maybe he has a degree of self-control. Whatever, the case, vis-&agrave;-vis his predilections each episode of the five part episodes of this first season is a rather addictive to watch, as we see Detective Superintendent Gibson trying to find him and stop predatory killing spree. The provided Mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of Belfast after the troubles, is none the less still a potential tinderbox, where sectarian gangs still hold sway. Some may be less satisfied by 'The Fall' finale - or feel that they were left hanging, whatever the case this series leaves enough mileage to run into season two.

This series as with the first exhibits disturbing voyeurism, where the audience is placed in the uncomfortable position of watching the killer, as he carries out his perverse crimes. Unlike other shows in the genre, the audience is precluded from a synopsis of dangling different suspects to maintain suspense - as we already know the psychopath from the onset. The figure we are given is a humanised psychopath because the homicidal sadist was not some socially pathetic loser, but a softly spoken man called Paul Spector, with a wife and a loving daughter, and a career as a bereavement counsellor. The Fall, has been called the most popular drama in the last two decades (the in UK media) and has returned for series two very much as a slow burn thriller as opposed to a bang.

This is a series that stands accused of misogyny, and of portraying the glamorisation violence against women. The first episode is set some 10 days after series one's unresolved, if not vexing, finale. The episode follows a prolonged hunt for a murder weapon in a Belfast river, and a hospital bed testimonial from Spector's half-strangled victim Annie Brawley, there is Spector's return from self-imposed exile. There are a total of six episodes in series two, for me a cleverly crafted series that on one level or another makes the viewer pretty uncomfortable - and poses some very disturbing questions about for example relationships, the effects of 'grooming' on children, as well as adults, and at times seems to come close to crossing the line - my humble opinion.

6901821,5,B00R7UKR7C,"I have a DVD drive that will play region 2 (Europe) DVDs so I bought this as soon as I discovered it because I was very anxious to see season two.  It definitely does not disappoint; it's as good as season one, maybe even better.  I hope that VERY soon season two will be released on region one DVDs so the US can enjoy this amazing British TV series.  Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan are mesmerizing lead actors.",1433289600,4,415,4.294871794871795
6901822,5,B00R7UKR7C,"Great Show!  Second season is in the mail.  I bought a multi region dvd player just for this show, of course I'll use it for others.  Highly recommended.  Most of us in the US will shake our heads to cops without guns.  Regardless of that, big bang for the buck!!",1432857600,3,263,4.18

8694456,5,B00R7UKR7C,"Intriguing series, although a bit violent and graphic. Would like to see it continued  to at least develop Gillian Anderson's character more.
There are hints as to what drives Stella Gibson but would like to understand the character a bit better. Cast is quite good.",1498521600,2,266,4.911111111111111
8694457,4,B00R7UKR7C,"I saw this on amazon prime streaming video. The first two seasons were quite good although the subject matter seeking a serial killer is dark.

The third season takes up where series two ends and I did not care for it. If you like very slow build up while waiting for something to happen you might enjoy it.

For series 3 I might suggest that if you watch it that you fast forward  and watch some parts of the first episode(s) and then watch the final episode of series 3.",1496188800,,472,4.222222222222222

Seeing Jamie Dornan in this role after FSOG was a little unsettling at first, only because the roles are so different, but what an amazing way he played it. All the actors really, it took the whole of them to make this series!",1494115200,,281,4.64
8694459,5,B00R7UKR7C,The acting was superb. The series was brutal and engrossing. Totally enjoyable thriller. Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson are both excellent in this series.
