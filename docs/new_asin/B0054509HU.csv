4559781,3,B0054509HU,"David Rasche plays Marshall, a xenophobic customs/immigration officer. In his final day before retirement they toast his life with a little JD, something he indulges in a little too much. They select which people to harass by randomly picking their passports. Marshall's bad side comes out by pushing a Brazilian (Hector Bordoni) into an altercation which resulted in his death. While in prison, Marshall decides to make restitution to his Brazilian family by going there himself. In Brazil, he is aided by Bia, a prostitute (Cristina Lago).

The story is told using flash backs. Marshall is searching for the daughter of the victim based upon some home film footage for some strange unexplained reason he was allowed to keep. The movie then flashes back to his last day at work in JFK immigration. Marshall is extremely over the line. I have doubts if someone who uses Latino slurs such as his, would even he working in such a position. I thought the acting was good, but the story was not compelling. We already knew the guy was dead, so when we got to that climax it was no surprise.

IMDB has this film listed under its Spanish name ""Olhos azuis.""

Two of the three immigration officials ,in the movie were terribly rude to everyone. They seem to just pick a few people out of passports,like a game and then give these people a very hard timem and laugh at them. You have an airport, taekwondo, smugglers, a poet, alcoholism ,prostitution , silly questions, heartache , racism and apologies.",1528070400,,473,4.925
