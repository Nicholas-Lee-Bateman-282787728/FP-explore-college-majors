8327657,5,B001NPDOL8,"One of the first TV series in my memory (I was only five). I recently revisited it on youtube to catch up with Will Hutchins who has lately been contributing hilarious articles (Western Clippings Website). The episode I was so fortunate to see (Return of the Canary Kid) has since been pulled and was the one whereby Tom was mistaken for The Kid with hilarious consequences (Will played both parts). When the real Canary Kid shows up, Tom (Will) has to use his wits to outsmart the gang. Not a shot was fired nor another man's wife defiled. I miss smart television... don't you?",1376006400,4,578,4.5673076923076925

8327661,5,B001NPDOL8,"From everything I've read about this show it must be great. I love Cheyenne, Lawman, and many of the Maverick episodes, all produced by Warner Bros., as was Sugarfoot, so it is probably a really great show. But I'll never really know for sure unless someone releases it on DVD!",1345852800,2,277,4.56
8327662,5,B001NPDOL8,I watched Sugarfoot and Maverick religiously as a kid. But Sugarfoot was my favorite.  I always wondered why Will Hutchins didn't go on to bigger and better things like James Garner did.  Had a crush on Will that wouldn't quit. I'd purchase Sugarfoot on DVD in a split second if it was available.,1320969600,5,296,4.566037735849057
8327663,5,B001NPDOL8,"I'm from the UK and remember these American TV series with great affection. Even at this young age I could appreciate the difference in top quality and lack lustre series. The good ones stood out. As kids we would discuss in depth the next day the programme we saw the night before. Sugarfoot, or Tenderfoot as it was known over here was one of the good ones along with Bronco layne, & Maverick. Why aren't they being released whereas lesser series have been put out. A general point, why are we subjected to paltry offerings in the form of best of Season dvds in colour. I want to see the early episodes in black and white, as I remember and loved them. When some series eventually went to colour this was usually after the series had run for a few years, consequently the ideas/scripts were no longer fresh and were well past their best. So give us complete seasons from day one even if they were in black and white. What executive makes these decisions, are they actually from our era, because they certainly don't appreciate the nostalgia and high regard these series were held in, not only now but when they were first shown. Do they not read comments from potential customers. We are also fed up of series being released and then the seasons split up into volume 1 and 2. We all know this is a rip off so most of us will not buy them when presented like this. The execs then wonder why they don't get bought. Get it together and provide the customer with what they want and value for money. It can be done, wanted dead or alive the complete series was released in full at a value price. Moving to modern times when will one of the best detective series, 77 Sunset Strip be released. In summary, certain series were hugely popular at the time and for good reason, stop releasing rubbish and give the customer what we want at reasonable prices.",1270339200,22,1848,4.438235294117647
