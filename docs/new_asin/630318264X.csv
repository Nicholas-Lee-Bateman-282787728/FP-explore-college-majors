591037,5,630318264X,"The cartoons on this ""Animaniacs"" compilation all come from the first and best year on Fox, when the gang at Warner Bros. TV Animation were at their peak in terms of writing and visual invention.  These particular cartoons were all written by John P. McCann, a specialist in finding the fun in ""spooky"" subject matter (and like most of the best Animaniacs writers, a gifted sketch comic).  Within the general theme, this collection has a lot of variety, including two welcome contributions from the cat-dog team of Rita and Runt.  Here's a cartoon-by-cartoon evaluation: ""Draculee Draculaa"" - one of the first Animaniacs cartoons to be recorded and animated, this cartoon shows just how quickly the show hit its stride; the TMS animation isn't as slick as it would later become, but the Warner sibs' trademark combination of innocence and knowingness is here, as are plenty of good one-liners and visual flourishes.  Dan Castellanetta guest-stars as Dracula.  ""Phranken-Runt"" - perhaps the best Rita and Runt cartoon; it's very funny, beautifully animated by TMS, and the Rocky Horror-esque songs contribute to the story rather than slowing it down.  Mr. Squeak, the large but uncoordinated mouse, is the scene-stealer here.  The late Richard Stone comes through with one of his finest background scores.  ""Meatballs Or Consequences"" - One of McCann's best and most quotable scripts, replete with satirical knocks at Ingmar Bergman movies, bureaucratic red tape, and (ahem) Steven Spielberg.  ""Scare Happy Slappy"" - a good, standard Slappy Squirrel cartoon, with plenty of pointless violence and meta-humor.  The sadly defunct StarToons provides excellent animation, particularly on the hapless Walter Wolf.  ""Witch One"" - a short Rita and Runt, nothing spectacular but with some funny ""Beauty and the Beast"" song parodies.  ""Hot, Bothered and Bedeviled"" - The Warners meet Satan.  Animaniacs at its best and least kid-friendly, with many unforgettable moments -- inlcuding Satan's idea of an agony that is worse than all others. No bonus material here, and some of the closing credits are inaccurate, but for 50+ minutes of pure ""Animaniacs"" entertainment, this tape is a sound investment.",1025568000,15,2190,5.294797687861272
591038,5,630318264X,"With the Pinky and the Brain cartoons, Spielberg productions found the root cause of the Warner Bros. classic animation success: a good story that appeals to adults will win over children. I have had the good fortune to watch my son appreciate more about these cartoons over the years, and, when he's ready to vote, I'll be sure to get him to watch ""Meet John Brain"" again--a clearer explanation of the electoral process than anyone ever got from ""Schoolhouse Rock."" ;) Now, if only Warner Home Video would release P&tB on DVD . . . .",1023408000,16,534,4.572916666666667
591039,5,630318264X,"Animaniacs is the best show with the best music! This is my review of every song: ""I'm Cute"" is a very cute and funny song thanks to Yakko and Wakko getting bored. ""Snitchelbank"" is very funny when you are seeing the cartoon, the same thing with ""Make a Gookie"", a parody of ""Fealing Grovy"". I like how they combinded 2 cartoons to do ""Our first day of School"" and ""Wakko's America"". H.M.S. Yakko has a funny story and the songs get better and better near the end. Can you sing ""Yakko's World"" without the words? I can! ""I'm Mad"" is a great song to sing along with my sister Nina. The theame song is great and very energetic. All in all, this is great!",999475200,19,652,4.266129032258065
591040,5,630318264X,"This tape contains the Animaniacs Stew ep of the incredibly groovy show Animaniacs. This basically involves the characters being switched around: Slappy and Dot are swapped, Pesto wanders about on Runt's back, Brain has  to manage taking over the world *and* watching Mindy at the same time.  Bottom line: It's Animaniacs. You should buy it.",960768000,12,341,5.181818181818182
591041,5,630318264X,"This video is great!  It has lots of Animaniacs episodes about winter.  Besides a little belching, it has a few good lessons, takeoffs, and jokes.  The Animaniacs are just as zany as ever!  If you like Animaniacs, you'll  love this video.  You'll probably also like other Animaniacs tapes(see  Customers Who Bougth This Also Bought:).  :-)",954547200,4,339,5.036363636363636

591089,3,630318264X,"I liked this Animaniacs collection, but it wasn't my favorite.  Unlike the other reviewers, I would think that if you owned only one, you would want some of the classics.  You don't want Brain in Button's place, you want a classic ""Pinky & The Brain.""  I am an Animaniacs purist.  :)",1174089600,,283,4.490196078431373
591090,5,630318264X,"A lot of the forgettable cartoons that Cartoon Network got from the merger with Warner Bros. are out on DVD, like The Oblongs and Mission Hill. So where are the great ones they got like Freakazoid, Tweety and Sylvester Adventures, and last but not least, Pinky and the Brain? I'm not suggesting anyone pay a lot to get this video on VHS, but Amazon lets you sign up to let the studio know we're all waiting for--Narf!--these cartoons on DVD.

Pinky and the Brain was by far the funniest segment of Animaniacs and other related Tom Ruegger 'toons. This video is especially funny because Brain breaks in between the cartoons trying to subliminally influence TV viewers and take over the world. Maybe studio execs need to watch this video to remember what really great cartoons they once made, and to realize how many people want them.

Let's hope we can have it on DVD asap. I can't wait & I would pre-order it (as I'm sure many other fans will be happy to do as well).

591092,5,630318264X,"In many way, Steven Spielberg's Animaniacs was ahead of its time of being retro.  Make Sense? Well the Animaniacs were really a throw back to the golden age animation of the 1940's.  This tape includes all Halloween/horror themed episodes in the usual chaotic style of the Animaniacs.

The shorts on this tape include:

""Draculee Draculaa"" - The Warner Siblings think that they have gone to Pennsylvania to find their parents (pencils) but instead wind up in Transylvania. They decide to stay the night in Dracula's castle. Dracula tries to bite Dot's neck, so they pull his teeth out for Dot to wear in her hair to make her look like Sheena Easton.

""Phranken Runt"" - Dr. Phrankenstein creates a monster dog, named Scout, to destroy a village, but Scout is struck by lightening which shorts out his brain. She does not have any spare dog brains to replace it. When Runt shows up, she plans to use his brain, but Rita sets Runt and Scout free.

""Meatballs or Consequences"" - Wakko eats one too many meatballs at a meatball eating contest in Sweden, and is declared living impaired (kaput) by Death (who has a Swedish accent). Yakko and Dot beg to be taken to the nether realm along with their brother, and then play checkers with Death to be allowed to stay with their brother.

""Hot, Bothered, and Bedeviled"" - The Warner siblings are trying to get to Six Flags Over Flushing, but end up in Hades instead. Satan wants to torture them but proves to be no match for the Warners. Satan kicks them out when Yakko freezes Hades.

There's also a Slappy Squirrel and Walter Wolf short that are of lesser quality than the ones I mentioned above.  But I've always preferred  the Animanicas themselves to some of the other characters.

Quite manic and hysterical and good Halloween fun.",1106611200,6,1777,4.681672025723473
591093,5,630318264X,"Just sat back and watched this tape with the family last night for the first time in a few years.  Boy this is some funny stuff.  Wakko, Yakko, and Dot are Warner Bros. crazies in the best tradition of Warner's golden age of the 30's and 40's.  This 45 minute or so tape features 6 holiday shorts featuring the Animaniacs, Wacky Squirrel and Pinky and the Brain.

Thier take on an upbeat and swinging ""Little Drummer Boy"" is a joy.  The Great Wakkorotti (read Pavarotti) Belches ""jingle Bells"" and is sure do delight the kids.

There's a nice take on Scrooge as the Animaniacs save Ralph the Security guard's job at the Warner Brothers lot from mean old studio Head Mr. Plotz...

All very good and fun stuff.  Good animation and songs.",1103673600,2,735,4.515151515151516

591116,5,630318264X,The Animaniacs live up to Warner Bros.' reputation when it comes to cartoons.  They are reminiscent of the old classic Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck cartoons.

591118,5,630318264X,"This particular Videos is amazingly funny for adults and the kids. It's got Holiday flavor, music and more. It is fun and energetic and clever. Clever anuimation and color schemes for the Holiday Season.
You'll hum at the tunes and laugh at the two brothers and one sister Yakko, Wakko and Dot.
Twas The Night Before Christmas: An interesting telling of a Classics. Funny and witty.
Yakko's Universe: This is a Christmas rehash of the famed explination by the Warner kids of how the universe works.
Little Drummer Warner: An upbeat and traditional telling of the special gift for a special child.
A Gift Of Gold: A real sweet story of the short lived lif of wrapping paper.
A Christmas Plotz: A great twist of Dickens A Christams Carol. And fun too!
The Great Wakkorotti: Okay this is my least favorite. Why its a little much, cute, but I'm sure the kids will love the belching Musical.
I watch this abong 30 others every Holiday Season. Watch it! Buy it! (11-30-03)",1070150400,6,966,4.654970760233918
591119,5,630318264X,"Okay yes they do talk fast, but this particular video has a great learning addition: both Wakko's America and Yakko's world is on this tape. Even if they kids don't get all of it, they'll pick up on some of it, and before you know it, maybe they'll recite the state capitals without much trouble.
It is fun, and while not all of the tape is relavent to the classroom, Animaniacs do provide a screen for learning that isn't evidant in many other 'educational' tapes.",1069200000,11,465,4.482352941176471

Other episiodes in this video are Temporary Instantly where the warners go onto a sound stage. Then in  Hello nice warners the Animaniacs help Thadeis Plotz in his office. Finally in Video Review the warners describe movies and what they are about.

7840439,5,630318264X,"One of the first performances I did (and throughout) in high school was Yakko's World, usually to a shocked yet applauding audience. My mother bought me this video after my earliest shows as sort of a way to improve the craft. I cannot believe it is almost nine years later that I received the singalong. It was a fun video at the time and Animaniacs was one of the most important satires to come out of Hollywood, ever.

Numerous singalongs from the hit TV show Animaniacs are featured, such as Yakko's World, Wakko's America, Schnitzelbank, Dot's I'm Cute and H.M.S. Yakko.

Looking at it today in this day and age, Animaniacs is still great, how it played true to life in many ways. There is no Chicken Boo in this video (BOO!) but is still a must have for every Animaniacs fan. It's funny for kids, adults and even critics alike.",1358121600,,833,4.509933774834437
