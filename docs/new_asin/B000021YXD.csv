7915283,5,B000021YXD,Dominique Barbier gives insights into horsepersonship you get nowhere else.  His instruction and demonstration are in a class of their own.,1400198400,,139,5.619047619047619

7915285,2,B000021YXD,Nice video to watch him ride his beautiful Lusitano stallions.  It would have been nice to also see him ride some 'problem horses' in a clinic to see what a difference his style makes when he rides a horse with difficulties. Too many times one has to see the same pictures of him riding around his farm. Some of the interview sections were too long - the book explains it a lot better. If I buy a video I want to see more 'hands on' material than talking. The 2 videos could have easily been combined into one and sold for less. $ 79 is definitely way overpriced for what you get.,1014076800,6,580,4.178571428571429
