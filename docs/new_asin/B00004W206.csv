7924406,5,B00004W206,"Alright there is a reason why you are looking at this movie on here and that's got to be because its so incredibly bad that its funny. Well its def that bad  its unbearable. My family and I rented it A LONG time ago by pure mistake. We couldn't finish it but its been a part of my family as a joke ever since. Every time we couldn't find a movie on TV, Me or my dad would scream ""YO PUT IN THAT BBQ MOVIE!!"" So for his birthday.....I bought it... We tried to watch it...Still could not finish it.. Its just horrible but it made his day and this movie has pretty much kept my family together. SO YO THANKS BAR B Q!!! WHERE DAT SEQUEL AT YO??? jk please no....",1381708800,,658,3.984848484848485
7924407,5,B00004W206,Bar B Q the movie is a ridiculous tale and despite its budget it really gets its point across.  There actually a few famous faces in this movie.... [...],1348099200,,153,4.275862068965517
7924408,1,B00004W206,In addition to being generally amateurish and inane and woefully unfunny this film is also very mean-spirited to gay folks too.  There's a hideous 'comic' sequence where a campy gay guy is mistreated by other party-goers that the film-maker thought so hilarious it's shown all over again at the end.  Most depressing.,1106870400,2,317,5.076923076923077
7924409,1,B00004W206,"The biggest crime this movie ever committed was not being watched and rated on imdb by enough people that it could be included in the bottom 100 movies ever made. This movie is largely regarded as the biggest tragedy to come out of the year 2001. The biggest 'star' of the movie is Layzie Bone from the band Bone Thugs n Harmony who had a pretty sweet song called 'Crossroads' which is the name of that terrible movie that Brittney Spears made, I guess the point I am trying to make is just because you can sing does not mean you can act (Vanilla Ice is the exception to this rule).

My friend Paulie purchased this movie because the guy at the DVD store said ""do you like the movie Friday"" of course ""Do you like the movie next Friday"" almost as much as Friday, ""Then you should buy this"" in retrospect the guy at the DVD store was pretty racist and may as well have been saying ""you like a comedy with black people in it?... well here is another one that is in no way like the other two movies I mentioned except for the colour of the main actors skin""

They should have a directors commentary on this film which is just him saying ""I'm Sorry, I'm Sorry oh lord I am sorry"" over and over for 90 minutes.

To summarise this movie was so bad I now hate Bar-B-Q's and other food cooking activities that take place outdoors just because they remind me of Bar-B-Q, if you are terrible in life and wind up in hell you will be watching this movie on a loop sitting next to the racist jerk who works at my friends local DVD store.",1022457600,2,1524,4.194539249146757
7924410,1,B00004W206,"First of all I would like to say this film doesn't even deserve 1 star, but I had no choice but to give it one.
On the cover that was on it in my local video rental store it read 'No. 1 US Box Office Smash Hit!'-HELLO?!? They obviously thought people over here in Ireland wouldn't find out that this is a failure of a movie so they thought they could pass it off as a 'good' film. When watching it, I actually felt embarassed- ...embarassed for wasting 4euro on it and for the actors who in 5 years time may find some sense and realise how completley stupid they were. If a bad storyline(which, by the way, doesn't exist) and a bunch of talentless actors who were so unfunny it makes you cringe watching it isn't bad enough- they could've at LEAST got decent camera men! In almost every scene-the camera swayed around or/and the leads for the'filming equipment'(which probably consisted of two seriously cheap camcorders and a baaaaaaaaaaad mike!)were visible while one of those grey fluffy microphone-things hovered aimlessly on the top of the screen. I seriously doubt that the camera-men/man knew what they were doing and to be honest I could've made a better job myself with my handheld camcorder and a bunch of my friends-who, by the way are all aged 15/17.
But then the film was nearing the end- it showed the whole crew dancing and just having fun as regular friends-and that just made me think to myself that they're just a group of good friends (good, rich friends!)having harmless fun. I mean, if you were 20,innocent,and living free and had the opportunity to throw together a movie with your best friends which probably wasn't even gonna be viewed by more than a handful of people- you'd probably be up for it right?
So, okay, this film is no 'It's a BeautifulLife' -or 'Mrs. Doubtfire' for that matter-To those who have watched this movie-who cares if it's garbage-lighten up and don't let it bother you. It's not like the people who made it expected anyhting more than a good laugh from it. It's only a movie after all,isn't it?
TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT YET SEEN THIS MOVIE-don't even let it pass your mind to consider renting this movie-it will only get you worked up, or in my case, leave you with a great deal of sympathy for the people who get worked up by it!",1021766400,3,2282,4.5144927536231885
7924411,1,B00004W206,If you strapped a camera on a monkey's back and just let him walk around town it would be still better then this movie.,1015804800,,119,4.0
7924412,1,B00004W206,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. That counts student films,All of the movies on IFILM. Every movie anywhere. This thing is not even a movie it's a collection of unfunny bits  With the actors standing on their marks not moving for fear of falling out of frame or stepping out of their key light if there were any key lights.
(...).
I hope everyone reads this and saves themselves the pain of sitting and trying to watch it.",1011398400,,447,4.321428571428571
7924413,1,B00004W206,"I picked up this movie in blockbuster because of the cover, and because i like black comedies. It started and for about half an hour this one guy was organising a bar-b-q. The way the scene's just cut made me question the producers ability and sanity. I thought however that i will bear wih it and that when the bar-b-q starts, the fun will begin. I couldn't be more wrong, all it was, was cutting to different scene's about different people talking about nothing to do with anything.
 I admire the way the director managed to fool all these actors into taking part in this atrocity and the way he hid the story-line so well, that no has since found it. I admire also the way that so many (30+) pathetic actors managed to fool the casting crew into appearing on this film. Think about it- the main actor was supposed to be this big-time actor in hollywood, so you would think they would hire someone with at least a little
talent. My suspicion is that they were all best friends with some cash to burn making a movie.
 The movie was so bad that some-parts where made funny. EG, that prat who spoke in the posh English accent and those Sissy's (epsc
near the end when they where trying to act hard). This movie signals hope for all ameteur film makers and right now i can't belive i spent $5 on it.
PS. I can't wait for the two new movies comming out, BAR-B-Q UNCUT in which there is an extra 45mins of phone conversation at the begining and secondly BAR-B-Q 2 in which all are favourite actors join up to hold another bar-b-q but this time in somebody else's house, i can't wait, the suspense is killing me.",1001376000,9,1607,4.3533333333333335
7924414,1,B00004W206,"Yikes, just yikes.  My friends made me watch this horrid movie and I can't fathom how it got made.  About half this movie is the guy throwing the BBQ talking on the phone to make sure everyone was coming.  The BBQ itself has no purpose and there is no real story.  I expected so much more from a movie with a box so colorful.  In addition, the cinematography is so terrible. ...  Run don't walk away from this movie.  THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!",988070400,3,438,4.204819277108434
