1807309,5,B00007ELDF,"I must admit, when I first saw the movie at the late, lamented Worldwide center (second run movie house) in Manhattan, I thought it was noisy and unfocused, and a lesser effort by a brilliant director.  I bought the DVD anyway, mainly because any Terry Gilliam movie is worth having, and Criterion versions doubly so.  Well, my opinion of the movie has done almost a complete 180 degree turn.  Perhaps the movie, coming out during the epicurian excess of the Clinton years, seemed like a sad relic of decades gone by-sort of an art house Cheech and Chong movie.  But now, with the nation and the world in such turmoil, and the divide between the left and the right in this country moving back to center stage, the movie feels completely of, and perhaps ahead of, the times.  Far from being a pro-drug movie (Duke and Dr. Gonzo are never held up to be the good guys, and their various ""trips"" are scarier than anything the anti-drug legions can come up with.) this is a movie about anesthesia,  One group may use drugs, another may use money, or power, or sex, but the effect is all the same.  These are people trying to escape from the reality of their existence, and for our ""heroes"", the anesthetic doesn't so much wear off, but pulls them even deeper into the horror.
The movie itself is an overlooked gem, but the good folks at Criterion have packed the dvd and companion disc with some of the best features they've ever attempted.  A Terry Gilliam commentary is always welcome, and Depp and Del Toro have their say, but how about a commentary by Hunter S. Thompson in full gonzo mode.  Well, it's here, and the second disc covers both the film's checkered life (especially the WGA screenplay flap: who'dve thought that arbitration was so fascinating), and the historical context of ""Fear and Loathing"", including some footage of the real Dr. Gonzo, Chicano attorney Oscar Ceasar Acosta (who's been missing since the mid-70's) reading from one of the books he authored.  In short, the disc succeeds as both a film, and as a study of a much misunderstood era in recent history.  I'm not sure yet, but it may just be the best DVD purchase I have ever made.  Thanks, Hunter Thompson, Terry Gilliam, and Criterion.",1046217600,14,2214,4.634271099744246
1807310,5,B00007ELDF,"This is not a drug movie. This is a movie about a modern day genius. A man who was is not scared to take the world on. A man who could do anything and feel any way he wanted to any time he wanted. Isn't that the american dream? Isn't that freedom? We go on with our every day 9 to 5 lives, and consider a man like HST irresponsible. When in reality he is doing exactly what all of us want to do but are scared to. I say hats off to you MR. Thompson and thank you for inspiring me to do EXACTLY what I wanted to do,which was get back with my X wife and my 3 Kids. HST FOR PREZ!",1046044800,2,576,3.653225806451613
1807311,1,B00007ELDF,"I bought and read the book after the movie came out. I loved it and couldn't wait to see the movie.  Then I saw the movie.  I know the movie never meets the expectation after a book, but I really didn't see a shaved head Depp when I read the book.  The lines come from the book, but they sounded very forced or fake to me.  Maybe it was because the best parts of the book come from what's going on in his mind, and that is hard to translate to a movie.  I wanted to love this movie, but I have to admit I never finished it.",1045526400,4,523,3.8055555555555554
1807312,4,B00007ELDF,"If, when you rent this film, you are expecting a Cheech and Chong film, think twice.  People frequently compare the two, but Fear and Loathing is not only infinitely better, it is not the screwball comedy everyone seems to think it is.
Johnny Depp plays Raoul Duke, alter ego to gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who wrote the book this film is based on.  He is sent on an assignment by Rolling Stone to cover a motorcycle race in Las Vegas.  Coming along for the ride is Dr. Gonzo (aka Oscar Zeta Acosta), Duke's repulsive attorney, played by Benicio del Toro.  The two rent a very expensive convertible and bring along with them a case full of illegal drugs.
The film is essentially the journey of two drug-fueled madmen through one of the most unfriendly cities in the country, but it's also a study on what life was like in 1971.  In the end, as funny as it may be, it's really a docudrama.  Gilliam directs the film in his classic ""nightmarish"" style, creating a truly hellish vision of America.  But the biggest surprise of all is how true the screenplay is to the novel.  Sure, like any adaptation, some good stuff is taken out, but if you compare what's written down, there isn't that much of a difference.
Most enjoyable, however, are the performances.  Johnny Depp is hilarious as Duke and Del Toro, despite how disgusting his character is, is nothing short of a scene stealer.  The film is also ripe with cameos, the most memorable are the ones delivered by Harry Dean Stanton, Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, and of course, Flea of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
I recommend this to any Gilliam/Thompson fans, though in order to enjoy it, you need to watch it in a generally filthy atmosphere, and for some of you, you may need to see it more than once to really appreciate this.  Overall, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a very good film filled with moments that stick with you for a long time.",1045440000,47,1904,4.521865889212828
1807313,4,B00007ELDF,I completely understand those who think after awhile this movie just knaws at your brain in the painful way redundacy always does.  But i can't help giving this movie a good review....its too damned funny.  Benicio and Depp are perfect and (along with the book) this movie has to have the most quotable funny lines in any movie I can think of.,1045008000,2,343,4.516129032258065
1807314,5,B00007ELDF,"Here's my candidate for the most underrated film of the 1990s: Terry Gilliam's film of Hunter S. Thompson's magnum opus revolted many critics and drove audiences away.  It's absolutely brilliant.  Depp's performance as Thompson's alter ego Raoul Duke (the inspiration for ""Duke"" in Garry Trudeau's comic strip _Doonesbury_) may be his finest to date, and for my money, Benicio del Toro's method performance as the bloated Dr. Gonzo surpasses his Oscar-winning work in _Traffic_.
With his Monty Python pedigree, Gilliam proves more than a match for Thompson's hallucinatory source material.  His shifts in and out of Duke's consciousness through the film reflect a similar instability in the book's own point of view.  One often gets the sense in Thompson's writing that he's observing himself meticulously, but has lost all control of his actions.  Gilliam's cinematic technique puts his audience in precisely that same unsettling position, and as a result, _Fear and Loathing_ may be the most honest film ever made about the experience of drug addiction.
After nearly five years of undeserved obscurity, this little-seen gem finally gets its due in a glorious new 2-DVD edition by Criterion.  It offers nearly total immersion into the gonzo world of Thompson, and features newly commissioned artwork by cult illustrator Ralph Steadman.  The oodles of extras tell you more about Thompson, Steadman, and Dr. Gonzo (aka Oscar Acosta) than any sane person would ever want to know.  Even Thompson himself gets into the act, contributing a typically garbled commentary track from within his Colorado compound.  But for the general viewer, the most helpful extra may be Criterion's new English subtitles for the film, especially given that the slurred speech of Depp and Del Toro is none too easy to understand.
Buy this DVD or rent, but for God's sake see it.",1044748800,3,1854,5.194630872483222
1807315,5,B00007ELDF,"This DVD finally gives one of Terry Gilliam's lesser-loved (but brilliant!) films the red carpet treatment.  The commentary from Gilliam is crazed and passionate; Depp and Del Toro really show off their wit, charm, and intelligence along with producer Laila Nabulsi's back-stage insight, and the last commentary is a rather odd and screwball one from Thompson himself.  I won't tell you a thing about the last commentary.  You've got to buy this and check it out on your own.  (Here's a hint: 'Screeee-ahhhh! Raaaaaaaagh!' *other assorted sounds*)
The second disc is crammed with some great goodies as well - Depp reads letters written to/from Thompson. There's a great BBC documentary showing HST and Ralph Steadman undertaking a trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.  Another gem is a snippet from an audio-book recording of Fear & Loathing with Jim Jarmusch as Raoul Duke!  All definitely worth it.
Fear and Loathing isn't just a drug movie (as all the extras on the DVD will reiterate over and over again) - it's a truthful, imaginative, twisted, and subversive take on the death of the most idealistic decade and generation. We get to see it all through the eyes of two renegade professionals, one a journalist and the other a lawyer, both fighting the good fight against scum and villainy.
We can't stop here!  THIS IS BAT COUNTRY.",1043971200,63,1335,4.906666666666666
1807316,5,B00007ELDF,"One of those movies you can't watch straight
Just like when you watched Wizard of Oz in mute along with Pink Floyd's ""Dark side of the moon"", Fear & Loathing is one of those movies that you have to at least live part of the lifestyle to get through it. I saw it the first time and fell asleep right around the middle, after they got out of the hotel (the incident with throwing the tape recorder into the bathtub), but it was only temporary.
On second viewing (and after reading the book about 3 more times), I was in a state of mind that wasn't quite right. Lying in the basement of a friend's house at 4am with the carpet soaked from the leaking house, drugs, booze, just DIRTY. And then, the whole movie made sense.
It is a great film. But it is also a great book. Some parts of the movie take things from the end of the book and mash them right in the middle, which ends up working okay.
It's a good movie, just make sure you're in the right state of mind...
The criterion collection will bring alot of the behind the scenes things.. like info on Oscar Zeta Acosta (Dr Gonzo) and should prove worthwhile.",1043798400,2,1108,4.231132075471698
1807317,4,B00007ELDF,"How could a movie like this be made in the late 1990's, when the caricature of a civilization that Thompson saw in Las Vegas has spread across the country and found itself in every local mall, fitness center, specialty shop, and Longaberger party?  Yet, in this hideous state of the world, Terry Gilliam somehow found enough people with enough money to thrust this film into mainstream distribution, showing that there was still at least a shred of hope at this late stage in our de-evolution.
There's a lot of drug use in this movie, but it comes across as noble and necessary self-medication against the creeping rot of ordinary culture and ""normal"" mental states.  The main characters have no choice but swallow and smoke as much as they possibly can to preserve their humanity.  And swallow and smoke they do.
This is colorful, spontaneous and well-crafted affair.  Don't expect your parents to either enjoy or understand it if they are over the age of 40, and the odds of them liking it if they are under 40 are still low.  It is just too odd, long, despairing, and simultaneously carefree for modern sensibilities.  Oh well.  Enjoy.
And please, whatever you do, don't do drugs.  You're liable to find yourself ogling reptiles at the local bar and grill.",1042416000,20,1259,4.7695852534562215

1807321,3,B00007ELDF,"This is a review of the film, not the Criterion Collection presentation. ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is the film adaptation of one of the most important American novels of the 20th century, written by Hunter S. Thompson. Although the book is widely read and praised, I find it to be an interesting albeit poorly organized account of a Las Vegas thrill ride. The plot of the book is held together by a thin thread, and I found this to be the same in the movie.

The best thing about this movie is the performance given by Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo. He's a thunderous powerhouse as the crazy sidekick to Johnny Depp, who portrays Raoul Duke, the main character in the book. I'm a Depp fan, but I found him to be very strained in this performance.

I give credit to Terry Gilliam for trying to reach for great heights with this movie, I just don't think he got there.",1427846400,,873,4.3496932515337425

1807341,4,B00007ELDF,"To be clear - this movie is not for everyone. In fact it's probably not for a lot of people. However, for people that like Hunter S. Thompson this film is an inventive and zany adaptation of one of his most memorable works.
I've read through many of the reviews, both positive and negative and it seems to me that the majority of the people that have given the movie either a one or two star rating have clearly approached the movie without ever having read the book. In light of that fact it is somewhat more understandable that the movie could be seen as a confused, jumbled and chaotic mess by some watchers, but if you've read the book you'll know that it was similarly chaotic and wandering, but in the best possible way. Many people have complained that Terry Gillian was the wrong director for this movie, but in my eyes he was probably one of the only people with a warped enough cinematic vision to portray the truly bizarre events that take place as creatively as was possible. I think someone like Oliver Stone (who has been mentioned by some reviewers as a potentially better choice as director) would not have been able to capture the humor that is pervasive in the novel in the same way Terry Gilliam has.
Another thing that clued me in to the fact that many viewers had never read the book was the fact that many of them complained about the dialog being boring or to ""out there"" etc. Those that have read the book would know that almost all the dialog in the movie, especially the voice-overs, comes directly from the book itself.

It should be obvious from what I've said above that most of the people who did not like the movie would not like the book either, and therefore they really aren't in a position to judge the merits of this film. You really have to be a fan of Thompson to enjoy the film and many Thompson devotees will absolutely love it as I did. When I first heard about the film I was having trouble imagining how anyone could replicate the idiosyncrasies of the book and yet when I saw it I was greatly impressed.

So, for those that enjoy the writing of Hunter S. Thompson this movie is an absolute must-see. For those who have not read the book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, I would recommend you check out the book first and then if you find you dig it I would then say get the movie. And finally for those people that don't like his writing or more particularly don't like this book, I would avoid this movie like the plague, because it's almost certainly not going to appeal to you.",1362441600,3,2523,4.377398720682303

1807353,2,B00007ELDF,"Here we have a case where a film's reputation is much bigger than the film itself. I found and bought this version of Fear and Loathing at a local yard sale at a really cheap price. I had heard a lot about this film, and was interested in finding out what all the fuss was about. After watching this film for the very first time, I'm really not sure what I can say about it. Simply put, this film is a crazy, drug induced journey to well...nowhere. Now I realize this was based on a the H.S. Thompson novel, and maybe the book explains things better and goes into greater detail, but as far as this film adaptation, I'm just not understanding why someone would be interested in making a movie like this. For me, there is no real plot..the film really doesn't go anywhere. Apart from the amazing acting performances by Johny Depp and Benicio del Toro, there's not too much to keep me interested. A large majority of the film is simply seeing these two characters take various drugs and watching what happens. And though its entertaining at first, by the end of the film, it gets very old. Maybe I'm missing something, maybe there's some deeper meaning that I'm not seeing here, but for me, this film just isn't that special. Yes, there are some good chuckles here and there (though I don't consider this a comedy), and like I said..the acting performances by Depp and del Toro save the movie from being a total disaster. I guess what I'm trying to say is there just wasn't even depth in the story to make a 2-hour movie. Like I said, overall, not a lot happens in this film. There's no real interesting storyline or plot, no climatic ending..nothing at all that would keep most audiences interested in to what's happening. If you wanna do a drug crazy movie..great, I'm all for it, but you gotta have something more than just the drugs! I just think maybe that this wasn't right novel to use to adapt a movie into. Now as far as the DVD goes, the packaging is awesome, plenty of special features, and a cool booklet to boot..so if you're a fan of the film and don't have this edition..its definitely worth getting..I have no complaints about that at all.

1807354,5,B00007ELDF,"I'm not going into what this movie is about or how it is, since that's well covered ground. I will say, though, that the review Amazon's chosen to use as the lead description on this page is little short of insulting to this movie and its fans. Shannon must be some sort of an inbred monster from a desolate backwood to make the kind of backward slanders he does.
What this review's more interested in is why you should buy this particular version of this film. Obviously, you're a fan of the movie (or at least the book) or you wouldn't even be looking. Or maybe you're a Gilliam fan...or a Depp fan...or a Del Toro fan, for that matter. This film covers on all fronts, and so does Criterion's treatment of it.
There are three distinct commentaries to the feature: the director, Terry Gilliam; stars Depp & Del Toro, with producer Laila Nabulsi; and the crowning achievement, the Beast himself, the late Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.
All three commentaries are better than you might expect; they're certainly better than I did. Gilliam's is obviously most concerned with the film-making aspect, as well as all the nuts and bolts of getting the movie made at all. It's interesting, if not terribly entertaining. The Depp/Del Toro/Nabulsi commentary is certainly the most interesting, but again not too entertaining; unfortunately, this is one of those times Criterion did 3 separate commentaries then spliced them together into a reasonably coherent whole. Lots of wonderful tidbits from all three speakers, particularly Depp and Nabulsi, who both have extensive and intimate knowledge of Thompson himself to inform their input. The last commentary, Thompson's, is a strictly-for-fans affair. Though not the incoherent rambling I was expecting from him, it is still a largely off-target thing, recorded with him, Nabulsi, and another aide viewing the film at what seems to be Owl Farm. This commentary is the reverse of the previous two: fairly entertaining, but not very informative.
There are also deleted scenes with commentary only from Gilliam. There are only about four, but they are fairly long and Gilliam gives interesting comments on all of them.
The entire second disc is a bit of a Thompson fanboy wonderland. I had a copy of the 1978 BBC documentary already, but it's nice to have a more durable copy, and it is really something any fan of the man's work should see. If nothing else, it's one of the few filmic documents of Thompson contemporary to his finest work. 'Hunter Goes to Hollywood' is a fun look at Thompson dealing with this movie and the team putting it together. Very entertaining, but not anything worth watching more than once (or maybe twice). There are some pieces from Oscar Acosta, the inspiration for Del Toro's character in the movie, and these are a revelation for the casual Hunter reader. Some additional artwork from Ralph Steadman, Thompson's longtime illustration counterpart, is a visual feast (and I should certainly mention the wonderful footage on disc one of Steadman illustrating the film title!) -- some published, some not, mostly at least rare. The excerpt from the Fear & Loathing... audio performance is...okay. If you have the disc, it's superfluous, and if you don't, you probably won't care.
The booklet for the set is THICK. I haven't read it yet (it's the only thing in the whole set I haven't 'done' yet), but I don't really get why Hoberman's Village Voice reprint/rewrite is what dominates. I'd have rather had Nabulsi do a little writing, as she's clearly in the know and could probably have made an even more significant contribution. The two Thompson pieces are 'Jacket Copy for Fear & Loathing...' which I've read somewhere before, and 'Instructions for Reading Gonzo Journalism,' which I may have read before. So, not anything rare, unprinted or even entirely necessary.
Overall, this is a must-have for Hunter Thompson fans...but not for anyone else, really. It's a greater film than it'll probably ever get credit for, but it'll always have it's most special place in the fans of Gonzo, and this is its best representation for that crowd.",1238457600,5,4099,4.942028985507246

1807359,3,B00007ELDF,"Classic American novel about weird America and the harsh come down of the 60s generation receives mediocre film treatment. Criterion Collection must have added this film because it'll bring in funds for the truly good films that deserve to be added. That's what I've assumed when I see films like this or THE ROCK in their catalogue. The history of the making of this film with its long list of who's who in the film industry that tried bringing the cult novel to the screen is fascinating. Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone both wanted to direct but didn't make it happen. Actors Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando and the Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi duo were considered (you guess who would have played Duke and Gonzo out of each pair. LOL). John Cusack was a possibility as the Doctor at one point. Unfortunately this is far from the best movie they could have gotten out of the book. Alex Cox (SID AND NANCY) might well have proven to be the best director for the job, but had ""creative differences"" with Thompson. Too bad. One interesting idea to my mind was making an animated feature. Filmmaker/animator Ralph Bakshi and Thompson himself wanted to do it. As the story goes, they tried to get Hunter's girlfriend -who for some reason had the rights- to go with the idea, but failed. She was set on doing a live action. The idea was to do the style of Ralph Steadman's illustrations for the book. Bakshi: ""I kept telling her that a live action would look like a bad cartoon but an animated version would be a great one. She had a tremendous disdain for animators because it wasn't considered the top of Hollywood. Hunter also could not make her change her mind. So she made the pic with Johnny Depp, and got the film I told her she would get - it would have been more real in a cartoon using Steadman's drawings."" Well, I'm a fan of Terry Gilliam and Hunter Thompson did get behind him. And after Hunter met Depp he wanted nobody but Johnny Depp to play him. Depp hung out at Hunter's farm absorbing and learning about the character and Hunter shaved Depp's head. Who can deny that Johnny Depp was the best (of known actors) to play Dr. Gonzo? Hunter liked the performance. And Benicio del Toro is a riot as 300-pound Samoan Raoul Duke. Put on about 50 pounds for the role. The actors fated to play these characters finally do seem the most fit to have done it. There are nice moments when Depp/Dr. Gonzo narrates. The words of the ""Wave Speech"" are very memorable. It's the kind of writing that marked Thompson as a one of a kind, singularly gifted author. In the passage he perfectly captures the mood of his time, the sense of that cultural moment that the 60s and the hippie era was over. ""You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning...And that, I think, was the handle--that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting -- on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark -- that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.""

Amazon review says, ""this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control"".

1807364,5,B00007ELDF,"I take issue with the Editorial Rant from Jeff Shannon. It seems his superficial judgments are against the backdrop of the film and the context of the characters use of drugs to come to terms with their experience. Why would Amazon appoint a ""critic"" with such moral apprehensions to appraise a film which is clearly outside of his capacity to undestand?

You aren't into drugs? Fine. Neither am I, and personally, Las Vegas has never impressed me, but that isn't the point. Let's put this film into perspective as a product of a novel story and a cinemotographic achievement. The direction from Terry Gilliam evoke a powerful response from the viewer. To film this story requires such incredible creative genius, few are actually qualified to the task, one attribute being a dark sense of humor. and then the subject matter of course requires some thinking. Then we have the performances. I can't figure out between Benecio and Johnny Depp who stole the show as the performances are spectacular. There are enough cameo appearances to set records, further challenging the idea that this was a disaster of a film descending on hollywood.

The 70's was an unparalleled era and caught within this period are 2 characters awake enough to realize that their own lives were not enmeshed within the forces that guided to the times. So in an attempt to explore their existential quest, they embark on Las Vegas to test the fruits of the American dream through its most celebrated product Las Vegas. There is an element of being lost, desperate to make sense of it all...were they hippies? Rebels? Misanthropic and depraved animals? Why weren't they happy to be a part of it all? So this experiment takes shape spontaneously and within the folds of the adventures, you find a narrative still curious and growing more cynical which if you can suspend your judgment will mirror your own thoughts (at least mine). Seperation anxiety grows, but behind it all is the humor of a certain director. Thus you find yourself watching the drama/comedy/documentary.

Criterion has passionately enhanced the experience of this awe-struck viewer. And I think as time moves on, this film will be lost to obscurity, but not for all. If nothing else, it has +500 reviews as of this writing. Like it or not, it has aroused attention, too bad (for them) if the vast majority of lifeless and sleeping sheep don't get it.",1203638400,2,2390,4.867321867321867

1807366,5,B00007ELDF,"At the start of the 70s, a somewhat freelance journalist takes a friend, a lawyer working on very difficult and potential dangerous case, with him on an assignment to Las Vegas to clear his head and talk about the case, free of LA's racial boiling pot.

Anything but that. Or at least that what we believe, because the Journalist, Hunter S. Thompson publish a fictionalized version of the trip in Rolling Stones, later becoming a book, and became what is regarded as one of the greatest novels in American literature.

After decades of government hell and multiple drafts of the screen play, Terry Gilliam is handed the directors chair and the rolls of Thompson and his Chicano rights activist  Oscar Zeta Acosta are handed over to Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro.

I have no idea why I like this movie, I was never really a Terry Gilliam fan or Johnny Depp fan, but one day out of boredom I barrowed my brother's criterion copy of Fear and Loathing.

ZAG! I don't know what it is, I don't know what is going on, I got lost at many points, but I loved what I was watching. Who the hell is Raul Duke? What kind of lawyer is Dr. Gonzo? Holy Hell, did they actually do all those drugs and trashed two hotels? Thankfully the multiple commentaries explain what was going since I never read the book before hand.

The movie has it's own hypnotic feel to it, the way the came swings around and the odd angels it's at, very bright colors, Johnny's acting. It's a psychedelic tale of two friends, trying to cover to events, a motor cycle race and a conference on dangerous drugs, but instead writing a story about themselves trying to cover the said events and the chaos that ensues with the aid of some LSD, some mescaline, and a lot of ether.

Journalist abound are mystified why so many people, mostly older teens and young adults are attracted to this story. Hunter himself thinks it's idealism of youth and the story's pro-freedom theme makes it resonate for youth. Thompson ""Wave Speech"" sounds like a condemnation, of what? His own generation. They had all this momentum, this energy to change the world, to kick Nixon out of office and stop the world, but instead they tuned in, turned off, and dropped out. As Stephen King said, ""We had chance to change the world and opted for the Home Shopping Network in stead.""

1807367,1,B00007ELDF,"This is for me probably the worst film Johnny Depp has ever appeared in.  Two hours of non-stop Gilliamesque nightmare - it never lets up. There is no rhythm - it's a non-stop assault on the eyes and ears. The editing is far too fast, the dialogue is so mumbled it doesn't make sense even on the few occasions when we can make it out.  Depp here assumes a bandy-legged walk, a bald head, aviator dark glasses and a cigarette holder as he morphs into the character of Hunter Thompson's alter ego.  Benecio del Toro gained forty pounds for the role of his partner in crime and plays it like a debauched thug. Depp nails a brilliant characterization, but there's no script to allow him to give a performance.

It's a druggy's road trip with hallucinations bouncing off the walls.  No plot, no sense.  Depp's narration identifies Thompson's generation as one of permanent cripples and perpetual seekers. There's a lot of the first and none of the second in this film.

There are a number of cameos from Tobey Maguire's long-haired balding albino teen to one camera shot of Lyle Lovett.  Both Michael Jeter and Gary Busey have one scene each. Christina Ricci (with whom Depp appeared in THE MAN WHO CRIED) has a small role.

I am astonished at Criterion even releasing this film, not to mention its loving assemblage of documentaries, stills, story boards, etc. in its supplemental disc.  This is the only occasion in their entire catalogue that blatantly does not make sense.  Even if it were a cult classic, which I doubt, it has no reason for being.

This film is not about drugs or indulging in hedonism; this is about America.  It shows Vegas as the dark side of the American dream, with all the slot jockeys (or whatever Hunter S dubbed them) trying desperately to have that one final fling at success, whatever that really means.  Depp gives another masterful performance as the deranged but brilliant Hunter S, and Del Toro is hilarious as his lawyer.

Thompson's great book didn't translate to a great movie. But Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a trippy, psychedelic experience that is a pretty good movie. Johnny Depp plays the alter ego of Hunter S. Thompson, Raoul Duke. Duke is a journalist traveling to Las Vegas, with his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who some weight for his role) and a trunk full of drugs and alcohol. Weed, cocaine, ether, acid, uppers, downers, screamers, laughers, and beer. They've got it all. They're traveling to Vegas to cover a bike race but once there, they find themselves more preoccupied with discovering The American Dream than covering any race. The movie doesn't have a basic plot, certainly not something that can be easily explained. No scene leads you to believe what the next scene is going to be and few scenes seem connected to the previous scene. It's, essentially, a series of surreal imagery all under the master direction of Monty Python-alum Terry Gilliam. This is a movie, I think few people will deny, is a movie you'll enjoy most while using drugs. You'll enjoy it more if you've used drugs. And you'll enjoy it about as much as me if you realize how silly, yet true, this film is. Most of the sane people in this movie seem more insane than Duke and Gonzo, even though we're seeing them from Duke and Gonzo's perspective. The imagery in this film (while occasionally cheesy, which is the point) is really good. The performances are great. Johnny Depp is hilarious as Duke and proved that he's one of the finest actors alive right now. He embodies the role and it's obvious he did a lot more with the character than what was on paper. Benicio Del Toro is completely loathsome as Gonzo, while also being hilarious. There's a slew of celebrity cameos including Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Mark Harmon, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Gary Busey, and more. A lot of people won't like this movie. A lot of people don't like this movie. That's OK, I think the filmmakers even knew this wasn't a movie for everybody. I've watched it three times now and it has grown on me with each viewing. You'll either get it or you won't.

1807387,1,B00007ELDF,"Maybe it's because I had never read the book and never heard of Hunter S. Thompson before this movie, but I found this movie to be unbearably boring and so utterly pointless!

At what point in the movie-making process while reading the script aloud, did they realize that this isn't a movie?  Or maybe that the book couldn't be made into a commercial movie?

The ""story"" if it can be called such, is apparently about a journalist and his fat hispanic friend (called his lawyer) who go to Las Vegas to write an article on some motorcycle race of some sort or something.  That's completely irrelevant, because probably 5-10 minutes is actually spent on that subject, with an additional 20 minutes at most devoted to the guy actually trying to accomplish the task.

The rest is just Johnny Depp as the main character rambling mindlessly about a variety of subjects, most of which deal with drugs, or drug-related things.  Others having nothing at all to do with anything.  They are quite literally taking every drug known to mankind, and the movie chronicles them taking drugs.

There are some scenes in which the duo are in their hotel room, where the ""lawyer"" freaks out in a bathtub and threatens to kill himself.  In other scenes, they are in the hotel club, or at a restaurant.  No matter where they are, they are always high on some drug, and Johnny Depp's character (Thompson himself based on his experience, under a fake name) is rambling or talking very very quickly and nonsensically.

There are cameos by minor celebrities, some of which are world famous today.  Gary Busey is on screen for all of three or four minutes as a highway sheriff who sexually harrasses JD's character.  Tobey Maguire is on even less as a hitchhiker who bails out of the car when he realizes the duo are stoned out of their mind and crazy.

The only moment in which I had a great laugh was in the beginning, where they are hallucinating that they are being attacked by bats as they drive down a desert highway.  When the ""lawyer"" stops to pick up the hitchhiker, JD's char says ""We can't stop here!  This is bat country!"".  That line and its delivery alone deserve the movie its one miserable star.  I expected better from Terry Gilliam.

If this movie was attempting to be shocking or pro- or anti-drug or stylish or artistic in some way, it is obviously only a most acquired taste, like a group of people who think consuming waste is an acquired taste.  There is no moral message here, nothing pro- or anti-drug, nothing shocking save that these two aren't dead by the third day from taking so many drugs, or stylish or artistic.

It is a film worth seeing because it not only demonstrates (to the closest I've seen on film at least) just what a ""trip"" is like, but also it is a reflection on the transition of the late 60's to the early 70's and the ""American Dream"" (which those in Las Vegas so desperately seek to acheive).

Johnny Depp masterfully channels the persona of Hunter S. Thompson (in fact, I keep forgetting during the film that it's Johnny Depp....truly a sign of great acting) and Benicio Del Torro plays ""Dr. Gonzo"" is a way that is a combination of humorous, curious, and frightening.

This is not a picture for everyone and the people who do not like it are not wrong and don't neccesarrily ""not get it"". This movie is made a certain audience.

The movie is good, do not let the above paragraph distract you, because it is expertly directed by Terry Gilliam, he of ""Monty Python"" and ""Brazil"" fame, who brings his slightly, okay totally, skewred perspective and skills to this film, and the two lead performances from Johnny Depp, who is flawless as ""Raoul Duke"", a Thompson psuedonym, a performance that isn't just mimicry even though at first it may seem that way, and Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, who some feel is a little over the top, but to me fits the vibe, anarchy for all vibe that the film has.

Features wise this is another top notch effort from Crtiterion, featuring three commentaries---one with Gilliam, one with Depp and Del Toro and with the man Thompson himself---, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, an audio recording of Gilliam discussing the controversy over the screenwriting credit, tons of footage with Thompson, and a funny section of Johnny Depp reasing his and Thompson's correspondence with one another.

A bizare, entertaining and mesmerizing dark comedy drama from the director of ""12 Monkeys"" Terry Gilliam and based on the classic book by Hunter S.

In his books, the writing is the thing. In this movie, the mumbling, the drugs, the vomiting, and the '60s is [sic] the thing. But I repeat myself. What is funny on paper is not necessarily funny onscreen; while you have the distinct feeling that Thompson on paper is spinning a yarn full of hyperbole and grand guignol, onscreen you're face-to-face with a love letter to '60s psychedelic over-indulgence.

1807400,5,B00007ELDF,"Certainly ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"" in one of the best book titles ever. How else would one respond to such wretched excess? They say, ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."" My response is, thank God! Let's keep it that way!

Hunter Thompson, lately canonized in death and very much admired by Johnny Depp, was always entertaining and often extremely funny. Recent attempts to pass him off as an important author rather than a psychotic, self-destructive pop-culture drug-addled icon, probably say more about the deplorable state of contemporary writing than anything else. His books, more rants than literature, are staggeringly narcissistic and yet, fail to provide much insight into his real character - such as it is. Still, they're impossible to put down.

Gilliam is arguably the most daring and visionary director alive, and Depp is easily one of our best actors. The alignment of this talent pool seemed volatile at the very least, if not a recipe for disaster. Then - a syzygy - strange alchemy occurred - powerful voodoo. The result is one of the most truly unique and fabulous movies you might ever hope to see, wildly original and other-worldly.

Depp becomes Thompson, an achievement so incredible even Thompson probably doesn't know what it means. Benicio Del Toro, who I first encountered here and have come to admire greatly, is note perfect. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a '60s film about drug excess; drugs are the vehicle, not the destination. FALILV looks in awe at bats and giant lizards lurking behind neon, chrome, sequins, feathers, and smooth marble; the cheap glitz and flashy glamour of the American dream, passing itself off as substance in the midst of a desert.

For all his (countless) faults, if Hunter Thompson had never existed, it would have been necessary to invent him. The same may be said for this film. A masterpiece, and an American classic. Congratulations once again to Criterion, another excellent re-issue.",1138924800,5,1974,5.009146341463414

Terry Gilliam is an awesome visual director in the same way that Tim Burton is an awesome visual director: every single frame bleeds its own distinct style of beauty, but sometimes the story just doesn't hold it up, or the stylistic elements get in the way. However, what could possibly be better to found Gilliam's surreal psychedelic imagery on than Hunter S. Thompson's story of his exploration into the American Dream? Still, it's a hard thing to pull off, translating Thompson to film, and while Gilliam does succeed, it's largely from the support of the incredible cast working under him to work out. Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro especially have to really work on exaggerating when needed, slowing down when necessary through what feels like hundreds of

hallucinagenic scenes with just barely enough narrative structure to pull them together.

Of course, the outcome is pretty fantastic, but it sets this movie squarely in the ""love it or hate it"" section of the world's video library, which is pretty much Gilliam's career simplified anyways.

1807408,5,B00007ELDF,"That ""Fear & Loathing..."" the film is more frequently panned than praised says more for it's galvanizing attitudes than for the quality of the work. A collection of two articles written about the death of the American Dream (NOT the assignments he was given, natch), the book ""Fear and Loathing..."" imploded the myth of middle class grandeur while, on the surface, offering no alternative other than constant drug addled frenzy; it was and still is easy for the puritanical mindset to see this more as a rationalizing of the drug culture than a dissection of American bourgeois mentality. But that's their loss really... What Hunter S Thompson is really trying to say goes beyond even the oft-repeated mantra that taking drugs is a REACTION to the BS state of 60s politics and society rather than an end in and of itself; he treats the omnivorous consumption of narcotics as a perfectly valid base on which to found his mordant observations on the American Way, unapologetically choosing to toke first and ask questions later. And based on the scathing accuracy of his observations, who's to say he was wrong?

""Fear and Loathing..."" wasn't the first of Thompson's works to treat the underpinnings of middle-class schizophrenia as the psychic equivalent to a bad acid trip, but it was certainly his most lucid, the cornerstone of his ethos even if he would write more insightfully and coherently both before and afterwards. Yet it's that point of view which either draws you in or revolts you immediately depending on one's temperament, a truly galvanizing role reversal whose essence dictates that, in order to really understand the American mindset, one must either be OF the conformists - in which case one would be blind to his own hypocrisies - or AGAINST the conformists, by which the only real understanding of the conformist's world could be ascertained by looking at his own non-conformist world through the prism of a fun house mirror. That analogy may be somewhat obtuse if you approach Thompson's work without a large dollop of surrealist thinking, but Hunter was never one for layman's terminology, and neither was Terry Gilliam one to oversimplify his source material.

There are those who are great fans of the novel who nonetheless look harshly on this film adaptation. In my opinion this is unfortunate, but I believe I can see why these fans may feel the way they do. In many ways, Gilliam's theatrical version usurps even the outlandishness of the book itself in it's carnivalesque portrait, there rarely being a calm moment to get one's bearings. My contention is not that Gilliam failed in his adaptation, but quite the opposite: I believe it's the literary nature of the book itself that makes it easier to absorb, in it's case the kaleidoscopic imagery being left more to the reader's imagination, which makes for the capability of either enhancing or ""normalizing"" the scenery of the text at the reader's whim. With the film, no such luxuries are afforded; the utmost imaginative capabilities are presumed as a pre-requisite, and Gilliam proves capable of keeping up with even the most abstract fantasist in this regard.

Taken in this context there is nothing to be held against the film at all. The performances are all flawless. The cinematography is appropriately earthy and washed out, nearly all the indoor scenes exhibiting the type of dim lighting favored by drunks and acid casualties, and even the outdoor shots appearing as if filmed behind the filter of tinted sunglasses. There are only a few scenes included in the book which are not adapted into the movie, and three of those are included as deleted scenes on both the Criterion edition and the Universal disc, the former being far preferred over the latter for it's encyclopedic wealth of bonus materials.

The Criterion release adds to the Universal debut with three commentary tracks, including a snarling, incoherent one with Hunter himself, his assistant along for the ride mainly to keep him on the subject, although - true to his character - he spares no expense taking potshots at the end results of the film, although one eventually gets the impression that nothing would have left him satisfied short of a production he himself shot, edited, and starred in (despite his friendship with Johnny Depp he can't help but take a few exceptions to Depp's portrayal of himself, particularly his cruelty toward the dwarf during the early Flamingo Hotel sequence).

Disc two houses most of the extras, the best of which is the 1978 documentary ""Hunter Goes to Hollywood"". This lengthy doc can be slow going at times but hits it's peak when Hunter actually gets to meet and talk with one of the Watergate conspirators (I won't ruin the surprise by disclosing which one but suffice to say it's not Nixon -- that would've warranted it's own full blown docu in and of itself). There is also a movingly pithy elegy to the vanished (presumed deceased) Oscar Zeta Acosta, that ""high powered mutant"" who was ""God's own prototype"" and Hunter's erstwhile companion for years before his disappearance. Speaking of Acosta, there is a lengthy reading by Oscar himself from his own ""Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo"" which is interesting but can get cloying after while; Acosta, for whatever his other merits, is not much of an engaging reader.

Finally, but not conclusively, there is an interesting excerpt from the audio CD version of the book featuring Harry Dean Stanton (who played the judge in the film). This is a scene at a taco stand in Vegas with Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo inquiring on the whereabouts of the American Dream, which the teenage taco vendor takes to be the name of a defunct dance club. It's an interesting thematic riff which never really takes off, and it was almost certainly an easy cut for the screen adaptation. There are wealth of other extras, divided up into matters relating to the book itself and those of the screen adaptation, and the packaging is some of the best you'll ever find on a DVD, so the extra cash for this Criterion release over the bare bones Universal one is a no-brainer. Even if you've never seen the film and aren't sure you'll like it, you'll be more likely to appreciate what all parties were trying to do here with the benefit of the supplemental material.",1129248000,5,6289,4.889409559512652

1807423,2,B00007ELDF,"I was first hipped to Hunter S. Thompson after reading an interview in a 1974 Playboy magazine, I was 18 at the time.

Despite thinking he might be insane (and thankfully he was, but in a good way)I was fasinated by his take on current events and the rich life he led. Since that day I have read everything he has ever written and have a library of all his works, ""Fear and Loathing"" being a favorite.

When I first found out that Fear and Loathing was being made into a movie I was thrilled, but did not get too excited having seen more than a few favorite books butchered in movie form. But after seeing who was involved in the making of the film I figured they couldn't lose....I was wrong.

It does not even come close to doing the book justice! If you have never read the book, or you were not alive during those crazy times you might enjoy this movie, but I recomend reading the book and skipping the flick. I have not seen the new version with commentary, and that part may be interesting, but despite whatever is said on this disc I know for a fact that Thompson was not pleased with the final product despite being a big Johnny Depp fan (as am I).

1807425,5,B00007ELDF,"I've heard a lot of bashing from professional critics on this one, but I feel this film was widely misunderstood by many. With a film so ambiguous and inexlicable in all it's drug raving madness, how can you bash it? This is exactly what it's like for most addicts: A repetitive drug frenzy with no rhyme or reason that is killed off by the next drug frenzy that ends with the same bad payoff. That's the horrors of addiction. You go from one horrific drug experience into the next one with open arms, because the addicted mind isn't willing to accept the horrors that keep happening, while things just keep getting worse and worse. That's what Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was. A compelling, no holds barred descent into the helpless blunder and infatuation of a mind wrought with various substances.
Moving on, the performacnes from Depp and Del Toro were awesome and memorable moments in both of their careers. I don't think anyone else could've pulled it off as well as they did. I also thought the visual style to the movie is really what drove the movie. You just don't see carpet designs crawling up people's legs or a bar full of bloody man sized reptiles in movies a lot. Or the nightmare that was the Bazooka Circus scene. You just can't take your eyes off this movie, and when the movie ends and you go back to your normal life, it almost feels like you are coming down off a drug itself.

Anybody familiar with the good Doctor knew it was a miracle he lived to the age he did. his death was a shock but then again not so, after all, Hunter was something of a fatalist in life. ""Fear and Loathing"" is a great adaptation of his most famous book, 7 years from the movie's release to Hunter's death. The fact that Johnny Depp and Hunter were good friends may play a role, but this is quite possibly Depp's best role! I am a fan of Depp and all his good roles, but his Hunter is dead on and although there is little known of ""Dr. Gonzo""...Benicio Del Toro does a pretty amazing Oscar Acosta. Like all films adapted from great books, the book is usually better but this is a fascinating movie with career roles by both Depp and Toro, both amazing actors in their own right. Like the book, the movie is about as hallucinatory and zany and twisted as it gets, but comedy is what it boils down to. One of the funniest moments in the movie is the appearence of a pre Spider Man Toby Macguire rocking a "" young guy bald on top long in back"" 70's style hairdo. It's crazy this took 25 plus years to be made into a film, the REAL story is so much like a film anyway!

1807427,4,B00007ELDF,"They thought Fear and Loathing could never be made into a film - and to an extent, they were right. But Terry Gilliam's film is no turkey, rather a flawed classic. Transferring the crazy ramblings of the written page to the screen was obviously no easy task, but there are moments of genius here. The tone veers wildly from farce to horror - one minute Thompson is taking copious amounts of drugs, the next his companion is plunging into a mental nightmare as the narcotics take their terrifying effect. Depp and Del Toro are excellent in the two main roles, managing to anchor a film which could so easily have flown completely off the rails, but don't expect a nice easy narrative to follow. Criterion have created a lovely package, although the third commentary with the now sadly deceased Hunter S Thompson suffers from some terrible sound quality. The BBC feature is incisive, and there's a very interesting piece on who got the screenwriting credit plus an intriuguing alternate ending which is rather downbeat considering the previously madcap pace. It's also a pricy DVD, but then you sometimes have to pay for quality. In the end, it's about as near as anyone will get to putting Thompson's gonzo journalism onto the silver screen, and is 100 times more interesting than your average multiplex crowdpleaser.

1807429,4,B00007ELDF,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was widely panned at it's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 1998.  In ""Premiere"" magazine's end-of-the-year list of the critical consensus of the year's films it finished around 95th out of 100 films.  So why does this film have such a devoted following?  Answers to that can be found in this superb package from Criterion.  As for the film itself, it's true to it's subject matter.  Writer Hunter Thompson a.k.a Raoul Duke circa 1971 is deeply apprehensive of the decay that he perceives is at the heart of America.  How does one cope with such grotesquery but with copious amounts of chemicals?  The question remains in imbibing said chemicals do they help you cope or do they just fuel the fear and paranoia?  I do not feel that this film advocates drug use.  The preponderance of it is more of a reflection of it's central characters' dependence on it and it is played so broadly and grotesque that it would be made unappealing to any thinking person watching this film.  I think where director Terry Gilliam succeeds is in showing the decay prevalent in America, Las Vegas being the magnet for said decay.  I think where he is less successful is in illustrating the social upheavals of the day and the creative processes that drive Duke.  Johnny Depp, however, is excellent in capturing the spirit of Duke which is apparent when viewing the real-life Thompson on the DVDs supplements.  Benicio Del Toro is equally fine as Gonzo, Duke's partner in crime and attorney.  As for the supplements there are three commentaries and I chose Terry Gilliam's.  Like any good commentary, it sheds light on the creative processes involved in making the film and almost makes you think it's a greater film than it really is.  There is a filmed segment of Johnny Depp reading correspondence between he and Thompson that is hilarious.  Another involves a visit by Thompson to the set of ""Fear and Loathing"" that is interesting.  Lastly, there is a British ""Omnibus"" segment on Thompson circa 1978 that shows him as a man who is weary of people not separating him from the real person and the Duke alter ego.  On an eerie note, this documentary concludes with Thompson visiting with an Aspen mortician discussing how he would like his remains disposed of.",1109548800,,2282,4.775510204081633

Hunter S. just died so I'm sure many of you have looked at this DVD, and it's worth buying.  Before making this film, Depp went and spent a while with Hunter S. in Woody Creek mimicing his every move, and it shows because his performance is flawless.  There are a few parts that Gilliam put in that shouldn't have been, like the scene where Duke throws the coins at the midget.  Hunter S. denounced that scene.  But he put the ""waves"" speech in the movie which is very important, one of the most important pieces of dialogue in the movie.  If you are a fan of the culture of the late 60s and early 70s then you'll like this film, it symbolizes the time through the weirdness and the idea that people shouldn't believe everything they see.

There are a great many problems with the movie:  it lacks a coherent plot line; whatever story-line exists will be lost on those unfamiliar with Thompson's book ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas; it indulges the actors in one long crude skit of bombastic drug humor (like a drunk - not funny to those who are sober).  More fundamentally, the movie breaks with the book in the one element that makes the book coherent and vibrant and that is its political, social and cultural commentary.  Thompson has a keen eye for capturing the American weltenshaung, and doing so in poignant and insightful ways.  The movie makes a faint nod at this element of Thompson's work by placing the character Thompson and his sidekick ""lawyer"" in a convention of district attorneys and police chiefs discussing the ""drug problem' whilst the main characters are stoned out of their mind.  This could have been a good movie- even perhaps a great one had the producers shown more moxie in inserting some of Thompson's pointed social commentary.

1807440,5,B00007ELDF,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

The overall message is that if you're going to go down, you might as well go down in flames, and take everyone down with you. The counterculture was dieing in 1971, the war against the old and evil was almost over, and this film represents it in full.

Hunter Thompson (a.k.a. Duke) and his attorney Oscar Acosta (a.k.a. Gonzo) are assigned to write for Sports Illustrated about a motorcycle race just outside Las Vegas in the agonizing desert. They've only got the weekend to do it, and very little money for other amenities. However, that's not at all what they do. Instead, they rent a convertible sports car, trash their hotel, and terrorize the casinos. And why?

Because they're completely stoned on drugs.

The movie starts out as an outrageous comedy for the truly sick minded. The sheer shock value can runs along the likes of Fight Club, for this is mostly a comedy, but a word of warning: it's not for the faint of heart. If you know anything about psychedelic drugs, then you know that there's a down side. The frightening side effects can scare even the strongest of stomachs, and as for violence or sex? Well, sex is hardly anywhere and there's only one scene of bloodshed. However, during the more serious sides of the picture, both hang will hang over you like a black, ominous cloud of nervously waiting to be horrified. I swear, on some levels this could work as a Hitchcock flick.

Yet thankfully it doesn't, and although the film is unsettling every time you watch it, there is a plus side to it all, a reason to appreciate it. At the end of each night's LSD trips, just before they call it a night, Johnny Depp narrates Thompson's book and describes the reasoning behind it all, like a Greek philosopher amongst cave men. Thompson's words, coming out of Johnny's voice, are so poetically profound and deep, that it suddenly makes you want to watch more and more of this stunning artwork.

But then, as if the sun piercing through the black night and giving way to the next morning, the comedy comes back to give a jolt to your systems.

As for any thing I don't like, I personally don't like the idea of screwing around with valet, waiters, and other work slaves to the corporate machine (because I am personally one of them and we should be treated better), but somehow it doesn't detract from the film. That, and the utterly disgusting array of hotel room violations (you'll see).

The very last scene is of Raoul Duke rocketing out of Nevada in his white convertible (the original red one was, well, you'll see). Jumping Jack Flash blares out of his radio, and suddenly the overwhelming philosophical thoughts that numb you are instantly blown away by this explosive rock song. As he finally smiles really big and drives off into the horizon with the American flag waving on the car, you'll feel that you've been down a brutal war with this strange man, and you've both come out victorious and heroes. At this point it becomes an epic, and as the credits drive by you'll feel like you've just been through something extraordinary with these two, weird guys.",1093478400,7,3113,4.637023593466425
1807441,5,B00007ELDF,"Hunter S. Thompsom,Duke (One of the Greatest Journalist) saying:

This is not the right time for psychedelic drugs............. Then there goes Duke and Dr. Gonzo in the movie dropping ten hits each of sunshine acid all at once, to Experience the living Las Vegas and reach the heighest peak, where duke were experianceing bars and pubs turning into reptile zoo.

""One Other Thing  you learn after years of dealing with drug people, you can turn your back on a person but never turn your back on Drugs"" Duke narrating, when his attorney Dr. Gonzo was almost reaching the sky sitting in the bathtub tripping about killing someone with a pistol in his hand, then obviously Duke got paranoid and locked him up in the bathroom, and started taking more acid.

They never realized what they were doing all this time, and what messes they have done. They kept on changing hotels, they broke all the laws, did everything that they were not supposed to do. They even took a young girl in to their hotel and made her take acid with them.

""Ether was wearing off, Acid was long gone mescaline comes in ..............."".  Saying this Duke and his Attorney gets in to a theme park all shaking and jerking, after about some time they get thrown out, but they were giggling and laughing at each other when they were carried out.

Of course its an all American dream, drug was spreading all over states at that time - going for a road trip to Vegas with a suitcase full of Drugs of all kind, starting from Marijuana to cocaine, acid, mescaline etc. The movie is hilarious and funny as hell, will make you laugh for hours. Some people might need to watch the movie twice to get the scenes, and what it means.

The whole movie is based on Hunter S Thompson's experience, actually he was suppose to cover a dirt race and attend a conference about drugs, in Vegas.

1807442,4,B00007ELDF,"""We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold""

 This opening line sums up what the viewer is about to go through for the next two hours. I bought this film on DVD, without ever seeing it before. I had heard of its funniness and its weirdness, but overall, I didn't really know what to expect. What I got, was an unforgettable experience. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a fast paced, exhilarating, comedic experience.

 The movie is almost a straight interpretation of the book of the same name, based on the true accounts of Hunter S. Thompson. The story is pretty straightforward, as it deals with Hunter S. Thompson, a journalist and political junkie posing under the name of Raoul Duke, going to Las Vegas with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo to cover a motorcycle and dune buggy race, in 1971. However, before their trip begins they pick up a suitcase full of enough drugs to make the trunk of the car seem like a police narcotics lab. Thus begins a different ""trip"" for them altogether. From there, begins a series of misadventures involving Duke and Gonzo as they search for their meaning of the American Dream.

 Let me address the fact that first of all, this film is directed by Terry Gilliam who did Brazil and 12 Monkeys, so right of the bat, this movie is weird. As our two heroes get more and more wasted throughout the movie, Gilliam effectively uses interesting camera techniques to make the viewer understand how the doped up guys are seeing things. It is quite strange and disturbing at the same time.

 I would also like to address the actors in the film. Raoul Duke is portrayed by Johnny Depp, who does the job brilliantly. This is one of Depp's best performances in my mind, as he captured exactly how Hunter S. Thompson acts. Apparently, Depp even lived with Thompson for awhile before shooting the movie so he could learn how to act. Overall, Johnny Depp's acting performance is reason enough to see this movie. However, Depp's greatness should not overshadow his co-star's performance, as Benicio Del Toro, who portrayed Dr. Gonzo did an amazing job. At first glance, the viewer will hardly recognize that this is actually Benicio Del Toro because he is fat and has crazy hair and such. It certainly is, however. Del Toro actually put on forty pounds for this film and I cannot stress enough how good his acting is. There is one scene in the movie, when Dr. Gonzo is completely wasted, and he's lying in the bathtub mumbling to himself, listening to ""White Rabbit"" by Jefferson Airplane. He wants to commit suicide suddenly so he asks a paranoid Duke to throw the radio into the tub when the song peaks. This scene is both hilarious and disturbing at the same time, and Del Toro acts so well here, that it actually seems like he was on drugs.

 In conclusion, this movie can sometimes be thought to be more of an experience than an actual movie. The film has excellent direction, which gives it a unique and almost artistic feel to it. Also there is a hilarious plot with a lot of funny situations, which makes the movie never get old. However, if not seeing it for the experience, the weirdness of the direction, the plot, and the comedic elements, then I would recommend seeing it for the brilliant acting performances alone. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an unforgettable experience.

1807443,3,B00007ELDF,"The first time I started to watch this movie I got a big headache. At my friend's urging I watched it again, and still got a headache. Maybe a little less of a headache, but that's besides the point. It wasn't a headache because the movie's plot made me think, it was a headache because the film was just damn strange.
Offbeat camera angles and dim colored lighting are used throughout the movie. The film quality seemed low and it was hard to understand Johnny Depp's narration at times. The film is very strange in all aspects, including its plot. Hunter S. Thompson (Depp) is supposed to be going to Las Vegas to cover a race in the desert for Sports Illustrated. His lawyer accompanies him on this journey for some reason. They don't really get much reporting done and spend most of the time taking illegal drugs. I kind of lost track of the plot and hardly remember how it ends. Was there even an ending? It seemed kind of like the movie just trailed off.
At one point in the movie they mention something about following the American Dream. Somehow I don't believe the American Dream has anything to do with a suitcase full of illegal drugs. Maybe it was just an attempt to find some rationale behind the entire film.
I'm almost ashamed to admit that I found it hilarious at times. I laughed hysterically when at one point Thompson thinks he's standing in a bog and everyone is a lizard. When I was laughing I kept thinking, this is based on a true story, and now this guy is making money off of it? I felt kind of bad for supporting his drug-induced craziness. However, it's almost kind of an anti-drug movie in it's own strange way. Hunter S. Thompson looks like he's having the worst time of his life, and surely should have been arrested multiple times. I don't know, maybe this movie appeals more to stoners and druggies since they can relate to Thompson.
This film is definitely not for everyone. If you are easily offended, I wouldn't recommend it. If you're looking for a normal movie, you really should be someplace else. Look at the cover of the DVD. The whole movie is kind of like that.

1807444,5,B00007ELDF,"First things first: FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, the film, is quite good. If you can stomach its content, it IS a rather fun drug odyssey with a fair amount of underlying social commentary. Some of it becomes muddled and the reviews were horrible (Ebert gave it 1/4) but I enjoy this more than Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, to be honest (which, ironically, Ebert also gave a negative review).
THE DVD
An overall wonderful experience. First, the packaging: superb. Criterion is always good at packaging their DVDs and this is one of my favorites. On the inside is an essay by a film critic and two discs. The first has the film, newly remastered under the supervision of Gilliam, along with three commentary tracks: by Gilliam, Depp and Del Toro, and Hunter S. Thompson. Wisely, they had someone interview him most of the time since he's obviously a bit of an oddball and would be prone to sitting there and saying nothing.
The second disc has some extraordinary specials, including an old BBC documentary about Thompson (whose semi-truthful novel this is based upon), TV spots, the theatrical trailer (with optional commentary by Gilliam - which I've never seen before), poster and photo galleries, Hunter Goes to Hollywood (an amusing short documentary about Thompson visiting the set of the film), a selection of somewhat bizarre letters between Depp and Thompson that date back to the pre-and-post-production of the film (Depp reads all of them to the camera for us).
Overall, one of the best DVDs I own. The film isn't a classic, per se, but it IS enjoyable. I'm sure part of my appreciation for it comes from this superb DVD, which is one of the finest I own in terms of special features.
Criterion can sometimes disappoint with single-disc DVDs priced in the $40 range but this one is fairly reasonably priced (compared to some of the others) and packed with special features to whet any die-hard fan's appetite.
A must-buy for fans, and a must-see for others - I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a blind buy for a number of reasons. It's very selective taste. You love it, or you hate it; it might be good to rent it first. But definitely rent this version, not Universal's.",1089504000,5,2182,4.759894459102902
1807450,3,B00007ELDF,"I've listened to Hunter Thompsons complaints about the film and I have to say I agree with him about how the style and the tone of the film detract from the characters humanity.
 The whole film it feels like you're watching some insane carnival ride which on one level is appealing yet is also dangerous as the film descends to the level of farce, and you feel no real emotion for Thompson or Oscar.
 Another danger of course is the drug use is trivialized, Hunter s. Thompson says 'hey drugs worked for me', yet having seen several of his interviews and documentaries its painfully obvious thats drugs HAVEN'T fully worked for Mr. Thompson.
 He has a cruel streak a mile wide, he is often paranoid, his motors too big for his boat so to speak. I'm not condemning Hunter S. Thompson, perhaps he's aware of what drugs cost him and thinks on balance that it was worth the price. I'm not sure. There is always a price though and that point doesnt come across in the film.
 Though its hard to argue he abused the enhanced consciousness drugs gave him, perhaps the ugliest part of a drugged up Thompson and Oscar was the way they often sensed peoples weaknesses and preyed on them like vultures. Total abuse of consciousness.
 That part of my review may sound overly critical of the film and Thompson but it had to be said. As far as the film goes, the cinematography and visuals are absolutely stunning, the acting of Depp and Del Toro and the supporting cast with a few exceptions are first rate. The film is extremely entertaining of that there is no doubt. The dialogue creates a sense of the surreal, however unfortunately no depth of feeling shines through the surreal. What you see is what you get and thats ok, but of course its a little disappointing that the film got so close to something enlightening and just stopped right there at the brink.
 Overall I'm entertained by the film, its always good fun to see someone flip the bird to the establishment and get away with it. Luckily I'm bright enough not to try and retread Thompsons path, those times and that path is long overgrown.",1087948800,,2090,4.545212765957447

1807452,5,B00007ELDF,"Wow, Criterion really outdid themselves on this DVD.
While I really enjoy the movie, especially Johnny Depp's incredible performance of Hunter S. Thompson (watch the extras on the  DVD to see how closely Depp imitated him), I have always become somewhat bored near the end of it.  Maybe the constant drugged out characters just lose their initial appeal, maybe the lack of any plot or storyline forces you to expect some sort of climactic point which never arrives.
Anyway, I like the movie, but loved the DVD.  How can you not appreciate a 50 minute BBC documentary from the 1970's featuring Thompson and Ralph Steadman.  There is a reading featuring Jim Jarmusch as Raoul Duke.  My favorite part though, is the commentary (one of 3 total) featuring Hunter S. Thompson himself.  He is certifiably nuts.  He lets loose with a couple of crazy screeches during the commentary.

1807457,5,B00007ELDF,"This film is nearly indescribable. It ranges from interesting and funny (often hilarious) for the first part of the film, to a trip into the depths of hell. It has been said, in reviews on this website and elsewhere, that it is a movie for drug users, yet I beg to differ. If anything, this film, along with the great ""Requiem for a Dream"", is the greatest anti-drug statement ever put on film. It is not only an EXTREMELY accurate and fascinating depiction of drug use, but a disturbing depiction of the complete hell that drugs can put one in. See it once, and you will come out of it feeling as though you have a hangover. See it again, and again, and you cannot help but be entertained. The performances are awesome, and Johnny Depp manages to be riotous at times. The dialogue, particularly in the voice-overs, is biting, witty, and intelligently funny. Intelligence is not what you'd expect from your typical drug movie. It is beautifully photographed, and has a great soundtrack. Terry Gilliam, the brilliant director, has said of his film that you will not like it upon seeing it first, and that you may well have no idea what is going on. Repeated viewings will register the film as great. It will make you laugh, cry, and wail in misery, but the end product is, I'm convinced, one of the masterpieces of recent cinema.
People say Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is ""not for every taste"", but really now, what person on earth could have this taste? It is not a matter of taste, for this film defies taste, it has no taste. Anyone is capable of seeing it and enjoying it. Just give it a chance, it's such a monumental effort.
The entire film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I think can be described as the character Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio Del Toro) is in the very end of the film:

The book was based on the true story of a drug crazed self proclaimed doctor of journalism and his sidekick turned loose in Las Vegas to cover a dirt bike race called the mint 400. Thompson, known as Raul Duke (Depp) and his attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta known as Dr. Gonzo (Del Torro) run amok in their desperate search for the American dream. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Torro are absolutely great in this movie. And the cameos are great: Flea, Lyle Lovett, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin, Cameron Diaz, Steven Schirripa, and even Dr. Thompson himself all make an appearance in the film.

1807460,4,B00007ELDF,"Visionary director Terry Gilliam (Brazil, 12 Monkeys) helms this would be mess (which was originally set to be directed by Repo Man and Sid & Nancy director Alex Cox) based on Hunter S. Thompson's drug induced ""gonzo"" journals.  The film revolves around journalist Raoul (Johnny Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) traveling to Las Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs to seemingly cover a motor cycle race, and we're treated to the duo's hallucinatory visions brought to us by the always great Gilliam.  If not for Gilliam's visionary directing and the outstanding performances from Depp and Del Toro, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas would be a pure waste of film.  And while the film borderlines on annoying, and the film outstays it's welcome thanks to it's running time (over two full hours), Fear and Loathing still manages to funny and enjoyable for the most part, and has since become a cult classic and is now part of Criterion's DVD series.  Had it been in the hands of Cox however, this could have been something really special.  Look for cameos aplenty from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Mark Harmon, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, Ellen Barkin, and Law & Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni.

The Movie: When I first heard that they were adapting my favorite novel, Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" I was thrilled. When I heard that Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame, the master behind Brazil was to direct it, I felt an overwhelming excitement, which doesn't come over me much. The movie is arguably the best adaptation since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". In addition to an incredible ability to stay true to the source material, the variations in the film do nothing but improve it. I honestly don't think I have anything critical to say of the film. It launched a liking for Depp, Benicio plays the best fat, drug-addicted Samoan ever, and appeals to justa bout all fans of true cinema.
The DVD: As they normally do, Criterion adds great supplements that enhance one's appreciation for the film. They make a great first impression w/ the menu, Disc 1 being what can be assumed to be Ralph Steadman writing the Title, and Disc 2 an animated Steadman drawing. The highlight is the feature-length commentary by Hunter himself (not that the Gilliam track is anything to look down upon). The 2nd disc, among other things) has a great BBC documentary, and a dialogue further explaining some problems w/ the screenplay credit.",1073865600,3,1505,4.726235741444867
1807467,5,B00007ELDF,"Fear and Loathing is just outright ""wet your pants"" hilarious at every junction. Not only does Del Toro sport the best beer belly in the business but Depp's take on Hunter S. Thompson just goes to show what a talent he is because the performance is 610% perfection in every department. This film just cracks me up!
The problem with this film is that it assaults mainstream movie-goers unconditionally from start to finish by never conforming to the standards that keep them ""safe"" inside their shell. If you don't let go then chances are you are another false member of that which Hunter S. Thompson is expounding about - the crook called the ""American Dream"". The person on your left is laughing. The person on your right is sitting smug faced. The one behind is complaining and the one in front is crying. The result is that if you hate this movie you hate it because you can just never understand it, like the business guy who walks into the toilet only to see a grown man sniff LSD from another's felt sleeve. The person leaves confused, will never understand it, because he has never experienced anything like that and has no clue what it is all about. People will try and deal with all of this by labelling it somehow. ""Drugs! Its all about those druggies and only druggies will get it!"" some may cry out. The truth is that people who may have done drugs will know a little about the unconventionality that this film is based on but yet again there are many others who will also get it, but never have done drugs. This film attacks a certain type of personality - those who are stuck so far up their own orifice with the American dream that they have limited their perceptions of life indefinitely and remain wooden throughout the rest of their existence.
Here we see two guys just make it to freedom of the ""self"" in any way that they can. The movie is one big trip of letting it all go and is by the far a screaming ride of absolute insanity from start to finish. There is not many mainstream Hollywood productions that do this and Gilliam's take on it is done passionately. This is just a wholly original riot of a move about utilizing mayhem and madness to transcend the banality of chasing phantoms that very few will obtain. While masses delude themselves with power and riches, the rest will just put their feet up and play with the cards that they have been dealt.
This movie is a wonderful experience that just goes to show that not everyone in life is an Ikea slave debaser of themselves. This is a film that has some humanity sown in among the insanity. Love or hate it, it is still needed and fills that cultural void nicely.",1073606400,16,2643,4.462809917355372
1807468,5,B00007ELDF,"I believe the quote at the begining of the movie and a quote HST used quite a bit throughout his career pretty much sums up the crux of the movie and it goes something like...""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."" I would also recommend that if you are going to watch the movie, that you also read the book as well. To me the movie is totally insane, funny and whether you like it or not will make you deal with certain issues that you may find disturbing to your sensibilities, don't panic, this is normal. If you are a true red blooded american who likes to follow the rules( at least when people are looking which incidentaly is the american way) then there is a possibility that you may find this movie offensive. But this should not stop you from watching the movie and finding a way to deal with it as did Mr. Duke and Dr Gonzo. Now it is also imperative for me to bring out at this time that what is also overlooked by the ""critics"" and casual observers as well is the tremendous work done by both Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro which in itself is worth watching this movie. Next, do not try to make sense of this movie, that would be a mistake, simply experience it as did the good Doctor and his Attourney and then decide for yourself how it effects you or affects you for that matter, but whatever you do, do not dismiss it, the decision must be made. Really there is no reason for judgement or maybe there is, but that is up to the viewer to deal with and deal with it you should. The bottom line is this, You should take two things away from this movie: 1. It is important, no matter what the circumstances are to always get the ""story"". And 2. If you buy the ticket then you must take the ride. If the viewer can keep these things in mind before, during and after this movie then I think you will be doing just fine and dare I say have a new found appreciation of what the good Dr. and the movie are trying to achieve.",1070150400,,1965,4.119791666666667

1807491,5,B00007ELDF,"Here's something for Brandon DiSabatino (reviewer): I have read Joyce, Nietzsche, Sartre AND Burroughs.
I have never considered ""Ulysses"" to be a reason not to make exciting art just for the heck of it. Jim's whole story is just a ramble. A beautiful sprawling wonder of a ramble, but a ramble nonetheless. Do you accuse Joyce's work of being empty?
I have never considered ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" to be a bible for the supression of fast paced fiction (remembering here that Thompson has repeatedly hinted that this 'autobiographical' piece is far more a novel than anything else).
I did not find anything that denounced good cinema in ""Existentialism""; exactly the opposite, to be frank.
And as for Burroughs (consider ""The Naked Lunch""): Do you REALLY think that Old Bull Lee would be at odds with Hunter S.?...REALLY??? It was part of this old heroine addict's dream for the world to see people like Thompson running around a tarnished America without a leash.
I realise that in this instance, what I am about to say could be seen as something of a ""pot-calling-the-kettle-black"" statement, but did you honestly think that your review would be helpful to anyone that wasn't a so-called 'intellectual'?
I loved this film. I loved it BECAUSE it wasn't about anything; BECAUSE it was different, and although all the classic reading of past years is of course still applicable to modern living, it just isn't, in fact couldn't be, anything like ""Fear and Loathing.""
Bloom's exploits in ""Ulysses"" are indeed interesting and frequently bizarre, but to the general public today, it simply won't mean as much as it did when it was written. The vocabulary used by Dublin's bohemian residants of bygone days was indeed got down pat by Mr. Joyce, but when it comes to recounting hallucinatory experiances in a desert, surrounded by some of the world's most venal and destructive ideals, Leopold Bloom and his kidney breakfasts just do not--cannot--pass muster!
On more than one occasion, I have actually mentioned Ulysses as a valid latter day comparison to Fear and Loathing and other films of it's ilk, but I've never tried to set the two up as competitors. Kerouac's ""On the Road"" also strikes a similar chord.
This is a film that you need to relax into from the writer's point of view (this being, after all,the whole point of reading((and watching movies)). The writing flows, if only you let it. People who seek to debunk Thompson in the way that DiSabatino does in his review are invariably anal people without any sense of creative fun; the kind of creative fun that all the best writers of bygone eras expounded until their voices were horse with the shouting.
You need to chill. I mean, ""Erasehead"" for crying out loud! Get a grip.
If you're not stunted in all the ways that Thompson hates, then you have to see this film. Totally brilliant, and at times, totally misunderstood.

1807492,5,B00007ELDF,"There are two ways of looking at this film:
1. Two men, every drug known to civilization, and Vegas!
-or-
2. Two men stuck in a 60's mindset, trapped in a city that represents everything wrong with America.
The first is how many viewers will initially see the movie, and though there's nothing wrong with looking at it that way, it entirely misses the point of the film. The second, though essentially the same as the first, is how it's meant to be seen. Also, the quote at the beginning explains a lot about their personalities...
""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.""
But many viewers dismiss it and look at the characters as simple drug addicts. However, DO NOT let me stop you from adding your own interpretation to the film, I'm just providing the basic groundwork. The great thing about this movie is that 10 people can watch it and come up with 10 different meanings for the movie.
The greatest aspect of this movie is not the over the top drug hallucination sequences, or even Johnny Depp's portrayal of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (which in my opinion, is his best performance to date). It's the dialogue that pulls the movie together, hilarious and endlessly quotable.
One of the largest gripes with the film is that it's pro-drug use, though how someone could come up with that theory is entirely beyond me.
To sum it all up, great movie, watch it, love it.",1066262400,9,1396,4.5
1807493,5,B00007ELDF,"This movie not about drugs, violence, sex, or the love generation, it is about something much more basic... something that in the United States we call ""The American Dream"".  . That is some kind of sense of righteous destiny in a place where good always triumphs over evil and nice guys finish first. The book is about that, or rather the realizations that it's not true: the death of The American Dream.
Basically, most folks believe that it is their right -- as long as they aren't hurting anybody else... they pretty much should be allowed to do what ever the heck they want to do, even if, and maybe especially if... the things they want to do harm themselves.
This movie is based on the book of the same name -- which it follows closely -- written by Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, whose alter ego basically is Raoul Duke.  Thompson liked this movie adaptation of his book.  The book was what Uncle Duke saw as a failed attempt at Gonzo Journalism... that had at its heart that sometimes the best truth is encased in fiction.
Some other more recent movies have, in their own ways, also been about the same subject matter: ""American Psycho"", ""Gladiator"" and even, in a rather weird kind of way... the Lord of the Rings movies.
The American dream either died somewhere along the way or did it simply never really existed at all, and we are somehow just mourning its passing like a bunch of drug crazed wacko's in the same way lots of other folks on a long strange religious trip mourned the death of a flat earth?  Many of us believed in The American Dream once, we were raised to believe in it.  But then something happened... something bad? Nixon took office and started defecating on the Constitution? Maybe we just woke up -- grew up?  Who the heck knows really, because I doubt we really ever understood just what we believed in at the time.
To quote a line from the book (from the wave speech): ""History is hard to know, because of all the hired bulls*, but even without being sure of ""history"" it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time-and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.""
The book and movie are, in some kind of way, an examination of ourselves... in the way you sometimes hear that an unexamined life is not worth living... the problem is that, when we look deep into the inner core being of ourselves...sometimes we find nothing.  Which leads to the ""paradoxically benevolent BS"" -- ""the desperate assumption that somebody-or at least some force-is tending that Light at the end of the tunnel"".
Which is why, in my opinion, a lot of people don't like this movie.  They are uncomfortable thinking about themselves in ways where the conclusion isn't clear and succinct.  They want to believe they are holding on to life firmly by the handle. They want to live in a world where everything makes sense. Of course, they are wrong. Or maybe, in the unkindest cut of all, they are perfectly correct.  The world does make sense - and airplanes are supposed to crash into tall building and thousands must die in order to feed the egos of the small groups of evil men who run the world. These are scary places and times, ones where you don't need drugs or alcohol to be scared.  But then maybe only the truly sane are getting whacked out on acid and heroin.
There are lots of good extras on the DVD's, the best are:
- A few scenes cut out of the film
- Three excellent commentary tracks from the Director, Actors and Hunter Thompson.
- A BBC documentary
- Johnny Depp reading from selected letters by Thompson
It is a very good movie if you are open to uncomfortable thoughts.",1063670400,12,3746,4.5266272189349115
1807494,2,B00007ELDF,"I remember checking this movie out quite a long while ago and thinking  very little of it. Very recently I saw it on cable and decided to give it a second chance. I have come to my definite conclusion about this movie. It's a visual masterpiece, I haven't seen images this horrific and intriguing since David Lynch's Lost Highway. Terry Gilliam is an amazing visionary and he truly brings to life the eyes of the binge drug addict. It's sleek look and feel is a great contrast to the disturbing images and the bright colors of Las Vegas.
The script must have been amazingly difficult to write. Most of what Depp and Del Toro say must be improvised I can't imagine anyone making any sense of what their saying or even what is going on in certain scenes. Depp and Del Toro give stellar performances that are almost too convincing, again proving that Depp is the most underated character actor of our generation. Del Toro is almost unrecognizable as Depp's lawyer who always ""legal advises him"" on important decisions such as when he thinks they should go see Debbie Reynolds in concert. Only to be kicked out a few minutes after entering.
Every aspect of this movie is done so professionaly from the editing to the film score/soundtrack you couldn't have a tighter film put together. So why the two stars you ask? Well it's simple, while I understand this film documents the culture of the times and where American was at (Check  out how many times you see the American Flag) during this time in our history. This film is a very true depiction of the lives of many sad people and how their day to day minute to minute lives is to do anything that comes their way, to remain high for as long as possible. But ultimately what does the viewer get for watching this movie? What do you come away with? What is this production communicating to you for two hours of your time? History data aside it says very little about anything. I'm not looking for a Moral but I'm looking for something, anything to take away from the movie. That feeling that the directors and actors have made any kind of statement is very fulfililng when watching such a well made movie. This movie is ultimately shallow and lifeless. The performances are brilliant but the only poor souls you feel bad for is the waitress at the end and Christina ricci who get caught in the war path of these two individuals.
Depps character is constantly questioning why he's in vegas, what is his mission, what is he there to do. Unfortunately so are we. I can't love, even such a well made/directed/ and acted film when it leaves me feeling so numb and empty.",1063584000,,2611,4.54140127388535

Fear & Lothing in Las Vegas is the movie that pop's up in my mind when asked ""what's your favourite movie"", i have seen it about eight times now and it keeps getting better.
Yes, it is f***** up, but that's what makes it so intersting and fun.
Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro portray their roles brilliantly as Raoul Duke & DR. Gonso, two drug abusing friends looking for the american dream.
Well if you liked the book (wich is brilliant) then i can't imagine you not likeing this.

1807496,5,B00007ELDF,"This is not a big star, ""lets see the cliche Hollywood machine churn another yarn that is identicle to the infinite other yarns that have been churned before,"" kind of film (yes film...not movie).  The narrative is obscured due to the mental state of the main character/narrator (Depp), and his  sidekick/lawyer (possibly imagined with the help of hallucinagens) played by Toro.  An unrelyable narrator with a twisted sense of reality is an effective technique to experiment with the traditional narrative form.
This is pure Johnny Depp-style off beat cinema that challenges cinematic conventions, and that questions deeper issues within the human experience.  Those who have seen ""Time Bandits,"" ""...Baron Munchausen"" and ""Brazil"" know Gilliam is not concerned with making a movie that fits within the parameters of traditional narrative, and traditional cinema.
My advice is to sit back with plenty of soda and popcorn at your side so you won't have to miss anything.  Take it scene by scene, and unlike what the...review suggests, you don't need to be stoned to enjoy this film.  It is a feast for the eyes, and a safe escape from reason.  But, be sure to question everything the screen shows you, and try to figure out what is real, what is made up for the hell of it, and what is drug-induced psychosis.",1061164800,,1308,4.945205479452055
1807497,5,B00007ELDF,"I didn't get a chance to see this film in theaters, nor did I rent it when it first came out. Why? Universal obviously are horrible at marketing their true gems. Anyways I rented this film a little over a year ago, and I still can't believe what a great film it was. Despite what everyone says about this film being too insane to watch over once, or that no straight person could watch the film over once, this film is perfect. Benecio Del Torro and Johnny Depp give their best performance of their career. They will scare the hell out of you at times, and make you bust your gut laughing the next time. Filled with great cameos like Harry Dean Stanton, Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Gary Busey, ""Flea"" of Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and numerous others. I guess the most overwhelming part is the directing and the director of photography. They both seem to show you the madness Hunter S. Thompson describes. This film shows drugs as no other film as ever had. The film was not nominated for an Oscar, which was the most pathedic thing I've ever seen. Depp and Del Torro give performances that are rarely seen in films these days. The Criterion Collection version of this DVD is a hefty price to pay for one movie, but it's worth it! It's totally worth it. The audio commentaries (three of 'em) are excellent. The other content of the DVD's are good too. A few good documentaries, theatrical trailers, t.v spots and more!

1807509,5,B00007ELDF,"I would love to read all the viewers' reviews with this movie but they're just too plenty (more than 300).  That just goes to show that a lot of hype was created in this film.  In viewing this film, you do not really have to understand the whole essence of the story.  You'll just be stuck and get entertained with the ecstatic behaviour of the two main characters under the influence of drugs.
  You may categorize this movie as one of those 'weird' films but after viewing it together with the supplementary commentaries, there's actually a political and social essence of the film although not broadly shown as much as the profound drug use of the two.  I liked this movie because there were a lot of cameos and aside from that, you'll never see any movie of this kind.
  Now, I don't believe that you have to at least have had drugs or that this movie tries to encourage the use of drugs.  It is definitely just the opposite of that.  Most people might think of this film as a pro-drug use but it is actually not.  How would you like seeing your friend as a demon?  And also, you don't have to be a drug user or have tried drugs to appreciate this film, contrary to other people's opinion.  This film is enjoyable and I like it.",1057708800,,1232,4.327510917030568

Despite all this, I absolutely HATED this film. It was painful to watch - an utterly wretched affair of bizarre confusion and mayhem. Watch if you must, but you have been warned. I would recommend seeing some of Gilliam's other (very fine) films, such as Time Bandits, 12 Monkeys, or Brazil instead.",1057622400,5,657,4.6239316239316235

This film is not for the average person. This film has deep undertones of social commentary that many won't pick up on. This film is NOT about drug use or abuse. It is a grim look back on the strange decade known as the 60's though the eyes of a reported in the 1970's. Its about politics and how the system has failed.

This is an absolute cult classic of our time.  Me and my roommate watched it every day for 5 days a couple weeks back.  And guess what?  It hasn't lost a single bit of its value.  In fact, its gained more.
Yeah, this movie is not for everyone.  If you are offended by drug use/abuse (this movie has the latter) theres a good chance you'll be offended by this movie.  However, my roomate's only drug use has been with Alcohol, and the movie has become his favorite.  As the good doctor says on his commentary when asked if this movie is a pro-drug movie:  ""Its a pro-freedom movie""

Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, Brazil, and others) does a wonderful job of translating the freewheeling and explosive style of this book to the screen, including creative interpretations of the psychedelic experience which seem untainted by the Hollywood predisposition for embellishment and hyperbole.  Depp and del Toro are very convincing and seem to have emersed themselves in the roles.
As always, Criterion has done a wonderful job of giving us the best possible presentation of this film with all of the extras we've come to expect from their releases.  Sweet.",1052438400,,684,5.373831775700935
1807516,5,B00007ELDF,"If the words ""we were somewhere around Barstow......"" mean anything to you then you will totally dig this film. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas is a milestone in American literature and has an amazing and well deserved cult following ever since it's release and made author Hunter S. Thompson a living legend. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, basicly it follows a drug drenched oddessy made to Las Vegas by outlaw journalist Thompson and his 300 pound 'Samoan' attorney Dr Gonzo. Their assignment may be to cover a motorcycle race, but their mission is to find the 'American dream'.
Hunter S. Thompson tells us on the DVD comentary that he feels the film is ""wonderful"" and while he finds small faults in the film, particularly Depp throwing coins at a dwarf, he clearly acknowledges that the bringing his own legendary book to the screen is an enormous undertaking. The already cult film truely captures the feel of the book, the humour, the choas, the fear and loathing. Johny Depp hung out with Thompson to get his character down and practically becomes Thompson. Benincio Del Toro doesn't exactly look like Dr Gonzo, but did put on weight for his role and manages, according to Thompson, to deliver a fairy accurate protrail of his complex character. When I first saw this film I was a little worried that the book I loved so much would be ruined by some Hollywood scum, but ex Monty Python Terry Gilliam gave the fans a brilliant adaptation. In fact I do not believe that I have seen a better film based on a book.
The two disk Criterion Collection set gives a film an awesome DVD treatment. I don't know where to begin, 3 commentaries, one with Thompson! Deleted scenes, including the one I really wanted to see in the orginal film involving Duke and Gonzo telling a country cop about the drug and satanist situation. Archival footage of Oscar Zeta Acosta the real Dr Gonzo reading from his own book! An old BBC doco featuring Thompson, behind the scene footage of Thompson on set, trailers, Johnny Depp reading correspodence from Thompson on camera orginal artwork gallery,a booklet iside the DVD case (the case itself is absolutely gorgeous) and even parts from the audio cd of the book! In short worth every penny of the price!

Terry Gilliam's masterpiece FEAR is one that truly defines late 60s and 70s culture. Through the story of the gonzo journalist himself -- Hunter S. Thompson -- Gilliam is able to produce a truly magnificent movie.
With co-stars Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro playing the parts that would normally be the opposite of the roles the actors normally play (and the ones that leave girls drooling), these heartthrobs let loose on a story that truly needs to be let loose. It is my opinion that only Gilliam, Depp, del Toro, and producer Laila Nabulsi could have created such a vivid reenactment of Thompson's masterpiece.
Criterion ups the ante by providing one of the best DVD's in recent memory by combining extremely intriguing commentaries by the actors, and even Thompson himself, as well as various film clips of the making of FEAR and deeper looks into the story that will leave Thompson fans thrilled.",1051315200,,1038,4.804469273743017

-out, loady-supreme movie! as a matter of fact it is an extremely
expert example of adapting book into film. 75% of films based on books usually end up finding a new direction in certian points of the story to help an audience comprehend the plot, or rather,
""get it"" and be able to get up and rent their next movie and plop back down onto the couch, remote in hand. i suppose this movie is a desired taste and most people really will never get
to know where it directly comes from, but that should not stop you from seeing the truly entertaiing story that is being told.

An existential morass of meaningless chaos is navigated by two chemically and morally wasted seekers in FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.  More an exploration of images and spirit than plot, Terry Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's trip (pun intended) to Las Vegas to cover a motor cycle race is mostly a non-narrative, non-linear reflection of the mental state of Thompson's alter ego Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his sidekick/lawyer Doctor Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro).

7975388,5,B00007ELDF,"""We can't stop here, this is bat country"". Fantastic movie, sort of a comedic drug odyssey through desert cityscapes. Johnny Depp has never been better than when he plays Hunter S. Thompson, I think it is easily one of his best roles-top 3. Benicio Del Toro however is probably the main reason this movie is a classic and Where The Buffalo Roam (also about Hunter S. Thompson) is slightly above mediocre. Depp, like Murray, does a fantastic job as Thompson but ever good protagonist needs a loyal sidekick and Del Toro is perfect. He lends so much to the film with an award-worthy performance. Very enjoyable, bizarre, and hilarious.",1513036800,,633,4.81651376146789
