8284151,4,B001BP14U8,"I needed a set of episodes from one of Misty's Pokemon and this DVD does that, covering three main key moments from the funny duck's time with everyone's favorite girl from the series.  Here are the episodes in Chronological order:
1.) The Ninja Poke-showdown - Ash's sixth gym battle against Koga, plus a Team Rocket attack where Misty discovers Psyduck's amazing powers
2.) Lights, Camera, Quacktion! - Funny Filler episode where the gang visit a movie set trying to get a Wigglytuff to cooperate on set.
3.) Bye Bye Psyduck - One of my favorite battle episodes where Misty battles another water trainer to prove her worth and she does (the ending of this episode is hilarious!)
I would have liked it if they showed how Misty got Psyduck (the episode Hypno's Naptime) but since Psyduck was barley present I'll give that a pass.",1440460800,,829,4.756944444444445
8284152,3,B001BP14U8,"When I saw these available I thought it was a neat idea...compile episodes based on your favorite Pokemon where they play a bigger role than usual. The Pokemon series has grown so large and has gone through so many arcs now that it's hard to keep up with, making these pretty nice.

The issue is that each DVD only seems to have 3 episodes, which seems like a waste of a DVD. It's only around 5 dollars over Amazon, so you get what you pay for, but I'd personally rather pay about 15 dollars if I got a more rounded collection of episodes featuring the Pokemon I liked the most. I realize that it's harder for some Pokemon than others(Pokemon like Pikachu and Meowth appear in almost every episode and have a solid role, whereas others, like Psyduck, are much more limited), but I feel like you could've found more than 3 episodes to feature.

It's okay for what it is, but I wouldn't bother with the whole collection, as it seems more like a money sink than a true collection of Pokemon episodes. It might be worth the 5 bucks for your favorite Pokemon, but outside of that, the appeal doesn't last long. If you've never ventured into Pokemon before, buy another DVD set to get a better feel for it.

As a side note, it has no special features or extras, just the dubbed episodes that aired in the US, and the DVD case doesn't snap together securely either(again, its 5 bucks, so I got what I expected).",1261440000,,1404,4.392307692307693
