The video is very crisp and clean, and it was shot nicely,  avoiding the frenetic change-shots-every-2-seconds style in many concert Blu-rays.  Less compelling is the concert itself, partly because of the small-club venue and also because the band just stands still and performs.  The hits are well done but they're rarely more exciting than the studio versions.  And there are many too many close ups of sweaty faces, arms and torsos; I felt like I was in a sauna much of the time.

Bush is one of my favorite bands, and Live! includes all the right songs.  But it's not a disc I need to see more than once.  You may not either.",1462060800,,673,4.459016393442623
8536770,5,B0096N6510,"Bush at its best!! Good, clean, crisp Blue Ray DVD with a lot of camera angles. All of there hits live plus 2 videos and an acoustic set of about 5 songs but the live concert footage is the best. I might have seen this somewhere before(or parts of it) on Directv. Very satisfied and would highly recommend to Bush fans or anyone else who likes to Rock!",1433894400,,352,4.1911764705882355

I have no more words to describe it, it simple amazing! I hope much people like bush band, but it is enough that just real fans like it!",1384041600,,282,3.7966101694915255
8536773,4,B0096N6510,"I was curious about this bluray because the AXS (originally HDNet) broadcast was riddled with Gavin's pre-recorded vocal tracks (used as backing vocals for live performances) being mixed LOUDER than his actual live vocals. It sounded horrible, especially during the chorus'. The first song of the concert, ""The Mirror of the Signs"" has been omitted from this official bluray release, and if you watched the live broadcast, its easy to tell why -- the performance was not very good (it was one of the first times they played it) and Gavin's live vocals were not on 'time' with the pre-recorded backing tracks.

When it comes to live rock bands, Im not into click tracks. Im not into pre-recorded vocals, Im not into sound effects -- I want live and raw. Bush's Woodstock 1999 DVD is a better example of this.... BUT, I will say that for THIS release, it was remixed from the live broadcast and the backing vocals have been lowered to make it much more listenable. Visually, the concert is stunning. A+ video. Performance wise, its not Bush at their absolute best but its good to great at times. ""Alien"" was fantastic.

Plays is 3 USA bluray players I tried. 1 PS3 and 2 different Sony bluray standalones. No worries if you are in the USA purchasing this. Trust me!",1371168000,2,1263,4.684684684684685

BUY IT NOW!!!",1367020800,,199,4.2105263157894735
