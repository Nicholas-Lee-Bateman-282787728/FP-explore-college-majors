8459354,5,B000MAZPIA,"While this must be categorized as natural horsemanship, it's the most useful natural horsemanship DVD I have seen and I use it's lessons every day in jumper and dressage training.  He's the first i have seen to start a conversation with horses by doing something for them.  I practice what I have learned from this DVD and it works.
 Frank Bell rides several different, unfinished horses of various breeds in his video. Much of the footage is from clinics where he demonstrates in front of an audience. He's honest about the nature of horses and the real concerns we have working with them everyday.  He works with several breeds at several levels.  He rides several different horses himself onscreen.  Methods are demonstrated and then the viewer is shown how to evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques by the reaction of the horse.
  I am a semi professional horsewoman that works with unbroke young horses and brings them up to show level dressage.  I appreciated the honesty of this video and the emphasis on the horse's reaction and the horse's mental and emotional and physical response.  Establishing and gently evaluating a horse's trust is central to safe and kind horsemanship and this video can advance the experienced and inexperienced horseperson.  It is especially oriented to the horse handler who wants to enhance a comfortable and safe two-way relationship with a horse.  Even someone with an advanced technical relationship with horses can benefit from this accurate portrayal of the structure of trust.
  If you want to be around horses you cannot help but be interested in and find enjoyment in Frank's approach.  I have watched this video several times and learn something every time by listening to the carefully spoken live narration and the unpracticed response of the horses.",1257379200,10,1805,5.03030303030303
