1178998,4,B000003KLO,"I used to watch this movie on tv quite a bit, and it always cracked me up!  I've never been a huge Frankie and Annette fan (they were before my time), but in this movie I really liked them as the parents!  It begins when Frankie and Annette go to visit their daughter (who's boyfriend is living with her), taking along their son (who is more or less, rebelling and having an identity crisis).  Songs are interspersed through the film, which are funny and entertaining; there is a cameo by Pee Wee Herman, and much more!
Pajama parties, surfing, motorcycles, beach bon-fires, etc., this film is full of moments of randomness and light-hearted fun, with couples ""fighting"" and making up all over the place!
For those of you worried about content: this film is somewhat family-friendly.  There isn't much language in this film, the content is more some drinking in a bar/lounge, a married woman flirting, a woman flirting with a married man, a girl with a live-in boyfriend, hangovers, etc.  In typical ""Disney"" style, they wrap up all the loose ends and end the film on a syrupy, happy note!
If you like the beach, and aren't afraid of a little singing, I'd pick this up to watch one day, if just for a temporary diversion from the same old movies that are always on...",1083888000,9,1267,4.588495575221239
1178999,3,B000003KLO,"3 stars if they don't put this extra on, and 5 stars if they do.
This is a great movie.  But my favorite song ""We'll Go On Forever,"" performed at the end, was never released on the soundtrack.  There will probably never be a new soundtrack, so please request that they give us this song as a bonus audio track in its full form.  In the film, the song is interrupted by dialogue, so Paramount just needs to obtain the original song in its complete form.  They could also add ""Pajama Party Tonight,"" which also was not on the soundtrack.
""Do you worry 'bout tomorrow?  Will it be as good as yesterday?  I just look in your direction, and then I'm glad for what we have today.  What I like about a love song is that you never can wear it out.  You and I are like a love song- in the end, we always work it out...""",1080259200,4,810,4.082278481012659
1179000,5,B000003KLO,"I have watched this movie almost since I was born (1981), so I may be a little partial.  But, the review that said something about Big Bird is completely false and only someone who wants attention.  And I guess they got it.
  This is a very funny movie that does spoof the beath party movies.  Don't take it seriously, including the cameos that pop-up throughout just like some of the present day comedies.  It takes you for a comedic ride on the beach, day and night.  Back to the Beach is for everyone old and young, even for a 20 year old.",1034812800,2,542,4.254901960784314
1179001,4,B000003KLO,"I absolutely refused to watch this movie in the theatres, or on video.  A friend asked if I had seen it and I responded 'I hated the beach movies.""  He responded, ""so did the people who made this movie, you'll enjoy it.""  I watched it, I loved it, I still love it!  It's sarcastic, which I believe, is why a lot of people don't ""get it.""  Great sarcasm, great cast (who better to make fun of themselves?) and great Frankie Avalon and Dick Dale surf music. Everything that was great about the surf movies (music)and everything that was terrible, made with fun.",1003708800,7,559,4.4411764705882355
1179002,4,B000003KLO,"Can't wait for the DVD to arrive!
It's amazing how some people just can't see the humour in this totally insane parody of the early Beach movies.
However, both Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello -- and Connie Stevens for that matter -- seem to enjoy sending up their earlier screen personas, and this movie is wildly enjoyable as long as you don't expect anything more than a totally mad, insane parody of a genre.
The director of this movie is an Australian, which probably helps explain the nature of the comedy content. I'm Australian, which helps!
But ignore the 'one-star, worst film ever made' type of reviews, and give this a chance -- it is MEANT to be an over-the-top cheesy take-off, and if you enjoy absurdity, you'll love it.",1002672000,31,739,4.6923076923076925

So many 1960s cameos: Gilligan, the Skipper, Don Adams, Wally, The Beaver & Mrs. Cleaver. My only complaint, the kid that plays their uber annoying son.

In my opinion, totally acceptable for kids of all ages & ages 6-10 may take more of a liking to it -- kind of an outdated Disney's Teen Beach movie. If you by chance grew up, circa 1980 something; you may recall (what I refer to as) the ""FLORISSANT BOOM!""  I think this was  a summer (1980 something) trend. I was still very 1st-4th grade... The bathing suites & sunglasses come to mind.  A one-piece bathing suite made to look like a two-piece...Genius!!  A two-piece with a zipper between your breast -- Hot!  Florissant orange, yellow, green, some red, some blue, even purple, SPUD MacKenzie for gosh sakes.  You will have to have some level of respect for that era, as well as; be able to laugh along with it and everyone else making fun of it. (The ""mullet"" exists & thrive on respected people...and...steroids are nothing new...I'm just saying). It will take a certain type of sense of humor to enjoy this movie.  I gave it 3 stars (3 stars = its ok).  I did this because, maybe 25% of people (between the ages of 34-42) maybe will laugh.  Some more than others... The majority of people will regret wasting the time they will never get back.  Give it a chance; it's cute, for the most part very clean, comical & it's the ""Disney's Teen Beach"" movie of the 80's (meets the 50/60's...)

If you want to laugh, and look back and just have a fun time, this is a great movie to get all of that. Even though the movie is decades old, the humor is still the same...parents seeing their children, not as they were at that age- but as they want them to be (like them)...Some of the humor is also for those ""insiders"" that remember Annette used to be in Skippy peanut butter commercials - that HAD show up here; Stevie Ray with the wind blowing his hair (inside the bar!).

There are many cameos from old TV show stars in this film, but they are not all that memorable. It's hard to come down so hard on a family friendly movie that means so well, but this film is mildly entertaining at best! The DVD transfer is fine with no extras at all!",1222560000,3,590,4.184210526315789
1179503,4,B000003KLO,"More than 20 years after they were the rulers of the beach, Frankie and Annette finally got hitched and moved to Ohio!  Frankie got a job as a used car salesman and Annette is busy making peanut butter sandwiches.  The years have made them a bit uptight and square(Frankie especially).  But when they decide to take a family vacation to Hawaii with their son(probably the most irritating and grating child ever put on film.  He shuffles around the movie looking like he just stepped out of the Blue Oyster Bar), they decide to pay a quick visit to their daughter(Full House's Lori Loughlin) who still lives in California.  They wind up back on their old beach and soon the fun begins.  They have to deal with a daughter that's now engaged to a surfer, their son joining a punk surfer gang, booze, old flames, breakups and makeups.  Basically they fall back into all those plot conventions of their early films.  At the film's climax(if you can really call it a climax) Frankie has to regain his crown as he faces off with the head surfer of the rival surf gang for control of the beach, and in the process face down the same enormous wave that ended his surfing career back in the day and sent him packing to Ohio. You can be sure that by the end, Frankie saves the day, everybody kisses and makes up, and the entire beach parties the night away.  Sound silly?  Of course it is, it's a Beach Party movie!!  It's all lighthearted feelgood goofiness.  It may be the 80s, but it's got the same tone and structure of those old films, and we wouldn't want it any other way.  There are some funny cameo appearances by Gilligan and the Skipper, Wally and the Beaver, Pee Wee Herman, and O.J. Simpson(!).  Unfortunately, series regular Harvey Lembeck passed away before this film was made, so there's no Eric Von Zipper and his biker gang, The Rat Pack.  Of course it wouldn't be a Beach Party movie without a few musical numbers as well, though not as many as the 60s films.  The most impressive being a guitar dual with Dick Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughn who are performing the Chantay's immortal classic, Pipeline(unfortunately it's shown very briefly, but you owe it to yourself to see the official video on Youtube.  Excellent song!).  Fishbone even show up to do a song with Annette!  Both Annette and Frankie do a great job of parodying their famous Beach Party roles, right down to some funny cracks about Frankie's hair style(he's referred to as looking like ""an Italian loan shark"" by one character) and pokes at Annette's goody twoshoes personna.
It's brainless, it's silly, it's fluffy, and even corny(at the end of the film, Annette says to the camera, ""Aren't we the corniest couple you've ever seen?"").  But most importantly, it's fun!",1209772800,4,2739,4.6314699792960665

Because, the beach movies were campy as get out to start with, but, they had an adorable quality to them, and a specific formula: Frankie does something stupid, Dee Dee gets mad. They flirt with other people to make each-other insanely jealous. They make up. (Yes, this happened here, too, but... meh.) And, where was Dead-Head, Animal, Candy, the Von Zipper Gang, for pity's sake? And, what was with Pee Wee Herman???

This is the first movie I can remember going to see in the theater when I was little and my family has loved it ever since.  From the singing and surfing to fighting and finding love, this would please any fan of the original beach era.  It does take some getting used to seeing Annette and Frankie together in a different decade and as parents, but enjoyable just the same.  They adjust well and I don't believe they could have pulled off a beach reunion any better than this.  The guest stars are endless from yesterday and today.  And I give two thumbs up for the soundtrack; it made me want to stay at the beach.",1122595200,,769,4.411347517730497

1179515,5,B000003KLO,"This film is a lot of fun. Frankie is as corny as they come and Annette- she STILL looks good, dry hair or not. The son and daughter(Lori Loghlin-GORGEOUS) are a little wild but good kids. LOTS of cameos- PeeWee, Gilligan,Skipper, Wally, Beaver etc. Good, if not great, music. BUY the DVD, and BUY the CD, which I just happen to have for sale on Amazon. But after reading 30 reviews I have one question? HOW COME NO ONE MENTIONS THE LATE GREAT STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN'S 5 SECOND APPEARANCE?",1111536000,,485,4.46067415730337

1179569,5,B000003KLO,"There are quite a few people proclaiming this the worst movie ever made.
They're wrong.
This movie was so funny that I had to be rushed to the hospital for emergency intestinal repair surgery when it ended.
This movie may be the answer you seek, even if the question is about dry cleaning.  See this movie.
Buy it, rent it, do something.  We must save this before ""they"" ban it.  It's an important piece of cinema, and a work of art.
Most importantly, Salvador Dali loved this movie.",1089417600,6,483,4.465909090909091
1179570,4,B000003KLO,"I grew up watching this movie.  I looked forward to watching it each summer.  BACK TO THE BEACH pokes fun at it's two lead stars - Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello (who produced this film).  This is part of the hilarity of this film.  It spoofs the beach films for which the stars are famous for.  This would be Annette Funicello's last theatrical release before her multiples sclurosis sets in.  She has the greater parts in this movie.  One highlight in the song ""Jamaica Ska"" for which she sings and dances.  What you have to remember is that all the cheesy dialogue and lame jokes are intentional.  Remember this and the movie will put a stitch in your side from laughing so much.  So in the spirit of this movie I'll say - Dude, you totally gotta see this rituous movie.",1088553600,,779,4.460992907801418
