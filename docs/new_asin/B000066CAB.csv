1712542,4,B000066CAB,"I've been recommending these videos for years to friends. We have them all now.  This set is great because it has Baby Mozart in it....definitely the best of all of them. However, my children 3 1/2 and 18 mos. love the other 3 too.  Both my children recognize the music played when my husband plays his cds. If they see toys or paintings that appear at stores, etc. they point them out and tell me which video they appear in. I just wish they hadn't put Baby Doolittle World and Neighborhood in the same set.  I also wish these sets were on DVD!",1031097600,10,545,4.271844660194175
1712543,3,B000066CAB,"We got this gift pack and volume one for a baby shower gift.
Volume one is not so great, but Volume 2 has Baby Mozart and Baby Van Gogh in it, which are both great. If you enjoy the Baby Einstein videos and don't have these, this deal is pretty good, since these are the best videos in the collection. My older daughter Emmie is just over two years.  She doesn't get very much stimulation from them, but will still watch them with her new sister and me.",1024358400,19,453,4.1477272727272725
1712544,2,B000066CAB,"We got this as a shower gift for my second baby, and are glad we didn't buy it ourselves.
The Baby Shakespeare video is a good gentle form of entertainment.  We were disappointed with Baby Bach. The music is nice, but it is much of the same toys used in Baby Mozart swirling around, so having both are not neccessary.
We like the idea of Einstein, but my child will not watch it, and shakes her head ""no"" when we put in Baby Newton...",1024358400,3,434,4.166666666666667

My 18 month old loves the Baby Einstein movies and this bundle was a great way to get a few differnt movies at one time, and for cheaper than doing it seperatly!

1712557,4,B000066CAB,"As most parents, I am the kind of Mom who wants to give my daughter (7 mths) any head start I can, so when I'd heard about Baby Einstein I had to give it a try.  My sister bought this set for my baby (4 mths at the time) for Christmas.  The first DVD I put in, Language Nursery, I was very disappointed with... although I agree with teaching different languages at an early age, I feel English should be taught first.  Language Nursery spoke many languages, but only about 10% of the video was in English.  At first I kept restarting the video, thinking I'd selected a different language at the menu, but that's just the video.

However, the other 3 videos in the set are very great (and altho I was unhappy with Language Nursery, my daughter wasnt).  They keep her interest like nothing else does and we quickly became Baby Einstein addicts, buying up as many as I can.  Every parent needs a break here and there and it's nice to be able to put her in her jumper, put a Baby Einstein DVD on and know that she's watching something educational.

Maybe other parents would disagree with me about the Language Nursery DVD.  Anyways, overall I am very pleased and would encourage anyone to give them a try.",1299715200,,1202,4.378378378378378

I'm a first time mom and I wanted something for us to do together and we bonded quick. If you take the time out to sit with your baby and go throw the video with them you will later be surprise how much they learned. Shes now 19 months and she knows her colors,shapes,ABC's and 123's and love learning new things.

The classical music is also a plus, I play the music when I don't want her to watch television or when it's time her to go to sleep. It's a great way to calm your baby down when they had a busy day. The Baby Einstein is a great collection and if you take the time out to use it right I can almost promise you will love it just as much as I do!!",1267142400,,774,3.8987341772151898

1712565,5,B000066CAB,"I used these when my son, now 7, was a baby.  I could put him in his exersaucer or bouncy seat and turn one of these on and have 20 minutes to (gasp!) take a shower, or wash dishes, or fold laundry.  He was captivated by the bright colors, the music, the other babies and fun puppets.  I don't think most REALISTIC parents believe that letting your child watch a movie for half an hour a few times a week is rotting their brain.  We also bought some of the companion music-only CDs for in the car or naptime.  My son recognized the music and would be instantly soothed.  We are expecting #2 in April and I've registered for a new Baby Einstein collection, as ours were passed on to friends and relatives several years ago.",1261872000,,722,4.272058823529412

The DVDs are good. Colors are vivid and attracting my 1.5 years old son. But my wife didn't like the fact that it does not have any commentary with the images displayed. So, it's just stimulating vision but not associating hearing (language) with images.",1258588800,2,293,5.0

1712568,4,B000066CAB,"As always, Baby Einstein was awsome. But you would probably do better ordering a better gift set. The DVDs in this set aren't all grouped together by age. The others are a little more expensive but are all from the same age group.",1253750400,,230,4.372093023255814
1712569,5,B000066CAB,"As a grandma who keeps my 14 month old grandaughter 2 nites a week, and who has trouble getting her down to nap and to sleep at night, I was amazed at how effective these videos were at both grabbing the baby's attention (it was like she was hynotized) and getting her sleepy enough to just lie down before the 30 min tape was over and go to sleep.

My daughter had them and used them so I ordered them for myself.  As I only had an old TV w/a VHS as part of the TV in the baby's room, I ordered the VHS tapes.  My daughter has the DVD's.  The TV must be placed so that the baby can see it from a sitting position in her crib.  But they work like magic.  There are 4 different 30 min tapes (or DVD disks if you order those) and they all use the same baby friendly format.  I don't know yet for how long she will be mesmerized by these, but for right now, I can highly recommend them for their sleep inducing qualities.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Einstein-Gift-Pack-Volume-1-Baby-Bach-Baby-Newton-Baby-Einstein-Baby-Shakespeare/dp/B00009RGC5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Einstein Gift Pack Volume 1 (Baby Bach/Baby Newton/Baby Einstein/Baby Shakespeare)</a>",1252713600,,1206,5.091370558375634

He loves the music, sounds colors and its very educational for him.  Each time he watches them its like he's never seem it before.  He's face light us and he sits perfectly still.

1712575,4,B000066CAB,"We have the Baby Einstein Gift Pack volume 1, that includes 4 tapes - Baby Bach, Baby Newton, Baby Shakespeare and the Language Nursery. It has been a month since my 10 month old daughter started watching these. In fact, her TV time every day is pretty much just the Baby Einstein video time. She started out plainly surprised and it was not clear how she felt about them. Now she is much much more expressive...she loves them! She is actually seeing a lot of things that I teach her using a book. I think her reaction to the different moving colors, shapes and objects is very much along the lines of what effect it  was intended to generate in a baby. I watch it with her every time and use it as a tool to teach her a lot of common things. Baby Newton and Baby Shakespeare are very educational. Baby Bach is a delight to watch for her and she particularly enjoys the music. However we did not quite relish the Language Nursery. For babies and kids, I think it is a little too early to hear so many confusing foreign noises, when they are actually still trying to communicate using one or may be two languages . Also, some videos overuse a few toys. There is a repetitive display of certain unappealing toys. Watching my daughter watch it every day, I am convinced that it is worth every penny. I would strongly recommend it to any parent who would like to teach and have some fun TV time with his/her baby.",1112400000,3,1409,4.337121212121212

Not so impressed with some of the newer ones like Doolittle, and he one with the computer graphics turns me off, but the kids like it.

I have 13 of the baby einstein dvd's, 6 of the cd's and 4 of the books!  My 10 month old daughter adores each and every one of them.

If you buy these you will go nuts and maybe even get so pissed, you crack the disks engaging your son/daughter into some dangerous activity. I hope you use this info wisely, and interact with your child/sibling instead of forcing them to watch the dumbest DVD ever.

Now, I've read some negative reviews on here and I must say I can see the point that those parents are trying to get across.  But Julie Clark tells us at the end of every video that you should watch with your child and discuss what you are seeing.  This is an opportunity to interact with your child, this is not intended as an electronic babysitter (Nick Jr. is the electronic video, or didn't you know?).  So if used properly they are learning videos.

The only problem that I have is with the music that is performed.  While the selection of music is wonderful and appropriate, its all performed on synthesizer.  There aren't any authentic recordings of Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, or the other composers that are on the other videos.

My baby has never had a pacifier into her mouth, but these videos have definetely been her pacifier all this time.
I can't explain the emotion she feels when she watches me inserting the videocassette for her, she claps her hands, sings, dances, etc!

Doolittle is a little disappointing.  I have not purchased Newton yet, and may not, due to reading of the reviews.  But, in comparison to the other series out there, Baby Einstein is the top.  I still use the other videos, because they seem to provide more direct education.  Yet, I have to work harder to keep my son's attention with the other videos.

They challenge their minds and capture their attention like nothing I have ever seen before! They are supposed to be on a child's level, not adult level!  Many of my friends also have these videos and rave about how their children adore them! Once the children are old enough, they start telling you what they are seeing on the screen.  It introduces them not only to music, but to the world. If you are watching these videos with your children, it is a great time to interact with them by explaining what they are seeing on the screen and telling them what color it is and what kind of animal they are seeing, etc.  Absolutely wonderful!

1712594,1,B000066CAB,"The only ""Einstein"" in this Baby Einstein is its creator, Julie Clark, for duping thousands of people into believing that her videos are eduational. Yes, my 13 month old does like to watch them, and why not? The videos are mostly a series of toys, puppets, disco balls, and kenetic sculptures set to music. My son would eat candy all day if I let him too, but I have the sense to tell him no. That's what these videos should be, a treat. Kids may be mesmorized because of the way it's presented, and if you  want your kids to sit and watch something beause you need a break, then that's fine. What I have a problem with is everyone saying how educational they are. Frankly, I do not see what they learn from watching a bunch of toys. I would rather my son PLAYED with toys! Most experts frown aginst any baby under a year watching any TV anyway, it seems we are going to have a new generation of couch potatoes! The only tape that had some eduational qualities is Baby Newton. It talks about and shows shapes. The WORST tape is Baby Einstein. It shows toys and other interesting objets while the background audio is of women speaking in foriegn languages, but not about what the child is looking at. It is confusing and pointless! What will a baby learn from that? At least Sesame Street counts in Spanish and is actually counting something, and that's free! The other two tapes are good eletronic babysitters, that also feature Julie Clark's spoiled brat kids. In Baby Bach one of them actually says,""The video of ME is all done? I'm not the STAR anymore?"" I personally do not find this amusing. I think she is exploiting her percotious children and people are falling for it. Not me. If you disagree and are so enamoured by this series, let me know...",1037318400,37,1753,4.461059190031152
