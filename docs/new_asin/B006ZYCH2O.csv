5043991,4,B006ZYCH2O,Outlander could have been a much better flick but it was fun enough for me to give it what I did. Wolfhound on the other hand tried to be spectacular but it jumped around like a jumping bean on steroids. I wanted to really like it but it just could not pull itself together. By the way I love foreign films.,1368835200,,307,4.049180327868853
5043992,3,B006ZYCH2O,"Outlander is well made and interesting. I give it 4 stars. However wolfhound was only a 2 star movie.

Thanks!",1365206400,3,110,4.5
5043993,4,B006ZYCH2O,"Outlander is worth it.  Wolfhound is tedious, on the level of the very first of Arnold's Conan movies but way worse.  It's a ""C"" movie, painful to watch.",1360540800,3,153,4.428571428571429
5043994,4,B006ZYCH2O,"I wanted Outlander because I enjoy these types of movies. But, WolfHound was a pleasant supprise. Both are excellent movies",1352764800,,123,5.2
5043995,5,B006ZYCH2O,"I was originally just going to buy Outlander but noticed the double feature that
included Wolfhound (that I don't know a thing about), but for two more bucks, what
the hay!
As it turns out, what you actually get, is two separate cases and movies, they just
pack both separate movies together in shrink wrap and call it a double feature.
What I am use to (and what I expected) was two movies on one disk, or a two disk
flap case.
So, you can pay $23.68 for separate movie orders, or $13.44 for the same thing.
You figure it out!
Addendum:
I watched (or tried to watch) Wolfhound, and my recommendations is to just buy
Outlander and don't put yourself through the Russian (badly made) Wolfhound.
My copy is going in the trash, and it takes a lot for me to toss a disk!",1338336000,24,766,4.289655172413793

8507340,5,B006ZYCH2O,Very satisfied with purchase,1425600000,,28,6.25
8507341,5,B006ZYCH2O,Good.,1423872000,,5,5.0
8507342,3,B006ZYCH2O,"Loved the movie Outlander could not get it as a single DVD to ship to Australia so bought it in the double with Wolfhound. All I can say is very B grade, dubbing is dreadful and the movie is worst, could only watch 10 mins and that was enough.",1414540800,,243,3.979591836734694
8507343,4,B006ZYCH2O,"All delivered on time, great effort. Received 2 individual DVDs instead of the double?",1412121600,,86,5.214285714285714
8507344,3,B006ZYCH2O,Outlander was good but I had seen it before.  Wolfhound is a foreign film that is badly done and not worth watching.,1389225600,,116,4.2727272727272725
8507345,4,B006ZYCH2O,I got the two because it was cheaper to get two movies than just Outlander alone.  And the movies come in their own wraping. Outlander is excellent. Thats why I bought the two.  Wolfhound is ok. Its dubbed and a very poor version of sci fi.,1381449600,2,240,4.195652173913044
8507346,5,B006ZYCH2O,"Order arrived in no time! I will have to come shop again. Great service, thanks for that! Cant' wait to watch my movies.",1380153600,,120,4.260869565217392
8507347,3,B006ZYCH2O,Love OutLander love anything sci-fi related but WolfHound is a subtitled movie and I do not like that at all. I understand the Lord of The Rings and Conan references but if this movie was in english instead of Scandanavian or whatever I would love it better.,1377561600,,258,4.51063829787234
8507348,5,B006ZYCH2O,"I order this DVD set primarily for ""Outlander"", but happy to find the Russian movie ""Wolfhound"" unexpectedly entertaining.  Good combo offer.",1368921600,,141,5.714285714285714
