The problems I had with it is hard to find a hard copy video of it for some reason. I have to look for years to find someone that was able to sale me a used copy that still worked. The length of it is the some as most adult anime. The only thing I can say if you find a copy buy it.",1514937600,,414,3.5604395604395602

I've NEVER seen a Hentai quite like this.  One that ends on a particularly sad note.  The main male character kind of reminds me of Tenchi in a way, giving his kind, indecisive nature and all.  I really liked the sensual conversation before and during the lovemaking scenes. All of the women (especially Mayuki), were extremely lovely.  I made mention of Tenchi Muyo earlier because the women from that series reminded me of the ones in Koihime as far as appearances go.  Musashi (the male character) is Tenchi, Nami is Kiyone, Anzu is Sasami, Suzaku is Ryoko and Mayuki is Ayeka.  Yeah, I have my twisted fantasies and all, but this is merely an observation.  Oh, and I also like their (the women from Koihime) alternative appearances.  When they took on the roles of princesses from their respective kingdoms.  What makes this one unique is when everyone in the ""kingdom"" has to cast their vote.  To either keep Musashi within their realm or exile him on a permenant basis, erasing his memory of the girls and the tender experiences he and they shared with each other.  I won't say what happens, but I'm pretty sure you can guess.  Buy it, and be prepared to be ""wowed!""",1252022400,2,1396,4.5951417004048585
