1972318,4,B00015HVI8,"This one makes six straight seasons of good Science Fiction televison. While Daniel Jackson is mostly gone now, replaced by Jonas Quinn, the stories generally still manage to achieve a high level of just about everything.
I liked the Osiris and Thor bits, and I thought ""The Other Guys"" was a bit too silly (it had a few Star Trek joke bits and Enterprises John Billingsley was a guest). The Air Force starship ""Prometheus"" was ridiculous becasue it would take far too many years to design and build such a massive object(It's only been about 7 years or so since Earth first ran into the Goa'uld, you'd need more time than that just to understand the technology let alone even think of using it)
The best parts of the episode ""Descent"" were the water scenes in which Carter and O'Neill almost drown in a corridor (that was a specially built set made up to be sunk in a deep pool)and the one in which Jonas must do a little underwater circuit work to save them.
""Frozen"" was one of my favorite episodes ;the body of a woman is found frozen in ice in Antarctica not far from the location of the second Stargate found on Earth. She revives during the thawing process and is determined to be from Earth's distant past, probably one of the Ancient races that really did build the Stargate system. Unfortunately she's infected with some virus, alomst kills everyone in the lab. In the end she saves them but dies in the process. O'Neill can't be saved so the Tok'ra take him away to be, grudgingly, temporarily implanted with a symbiote. The next episode ""Abyss"" was a sequel to this one, and was pretty sloppy in some ways, it did have Daniel Jackson appearing to O'Neill to help him out.
As always you've got O'Neill's humorous/ dumb commentary in each episode, sometimes that guy can seem too stupid for the job.",1075161600,15,1809,4.569230769230769
1972319,5,B00015HVI8,"Another great Season of Stargate SG-1.  If you are here, then I don't have to tell you that!  I always search everywhere on the internet and try to get some advance notice about DVD releases.  As with the prior seasons, the format is Widescreen anamorphic - 1.78:1 and the audio is Dolby Digital 5.1. Disappointingly, MGM's site had very little information.  I especially wanted to find out what the ""Director Series"" is in the extras.  I could not find out too much.  Only one website had this description:  The Director Series features give insight into the working day of the director on issues such as script development, prop and set creation.
Here is an episode guide, with a tiny description.
1. Redemption - Part 1:  The Stargate malfunctions and threatens to destroy all life on Earth.
2. Redemption - Part 2:  Teal'c and Ryac decide to destroy the weapon that has turned the Stargate into a bomb.
3. Descent:  After being ambushed, Carter and an SG-1 team crash into the Pacific Ocean.
4. Frozen:  A woman who has been frozen for thousands of years is thawed and returns to life, infecting the others with a deadly virus.
5. Nightwalkers:  Immunitech is implanting Gou'ald symbiotes into the citizens of an Oregon town.
6. Abyss:  Jack is captured and tortured by  the Gou'ald.  Daniel Jackson's ghost returns to help him.
7. Shadowplay:  The Kelownans, who are from Jonas's home planet, negotiate for Earth's superior military technology.  Dr. Kieran, a Kelownan scientist, tells Jonas that he is part of a resistance movement trying to save the planet.
8. The Other Guys: Felger and Coombs try to rescue an SG-1 team, who was taken captive by the Gou'ald.
9. Allegiance:  Artok is suspected of Ocker's murder, and then is murdered himself.
10. Cure: The Pangerans offer to trade the secret of a miracle drug for instruction in how to use a gate.  However, there is a problem with the drug.
11. Prometheus - Part 1:  Operatives posing as camera crew hijack a new spacecraft that combines human with alien technology.
12.  Unnatural Selection - Part 2:  Replicators have overrun an Asgard world and created a time distortion there.
13. Sight Unseen:  An ancient artifact from another planet is responsible for the spread of a contagious ""disease"" on Earth.
14. Smoke and Mirrors:  Senator Kinsey is assassinated by a man who looks like Colonel Jack O'Neill.
15. Paradise  Lost:  Colonel Maybourne and Colonel O'Neill end up on a planet that Maybourne says is a secret alien paradise.
16. Metamorphosis:  Gou'ald queen, Nirrti, may be creating a race of super human warriors through the manipulation of DNA.
17. Disclosure:  The  U.S. and  Russia disclose the existence of Stargate to the United Kingdom, France, and China.
18. Forsaken:  SG-1 finds three human survivors on another planet that are under attack, seemingly without a reason.
19. The Changeling:  Teal'c believes  he has lost his symbiote.
20. Memento:  The SG-1 team hear of a mythical Stargate on an inhabited planet.
21. Prophecy:  The citizens of an alien planet believe that the SG-1 team have arrived to fulfill an ancient prophecy to free them from tyranny.
22. Full  Circle:  The ghost of Daniel Jackson tells O'neill that Anubis is scheming to steal the Eye of Ra.",1075075200,217,3247,4.880952380952381
1972320,4,B00015HVI8,"Stargate from the begining has been one of my favorite TV shows. Especially as of late. I've given up on Star Trek. This season while better than most shows was just not up to par with the level of previous SGSG1 seasons. I know there were reasons but I could never get past Jonas being Parker Lewis. Anyway it's definately worth picking up. But if you want 5star SciFi check out ""Firefly"".",1075075200,14,390,4.430555555555555
1972321,5,B00015HVI8,"Having grown up with the original Star Trek TV series, plus all of the subsequent movies and other Star Trek television series, I must say that the storyline in the Stargate SG-1 episodes puts Star Trek to shame.
Can any Sci-Fi afficionado not be impressed by the originality of the entire Stargate setup, from the effect of seeing a starship come out of hyperspace to the warm feeling one gets when the Asgard (usually represented by Thor) show up and that special music starts playing?
This is probably the only TV series in which I'll purchase every season's DVD boxset.",1074384000,65,573,4.74
1972322,5,B00015HVI8,"For some reason, each season of StarGate, IMO, gets better as a lateral, one being my least favorite, up on and so forth getting better. Season six was no exception. The opening three episodes were some of the best in the series, and the finale was nothing short of amazing. The addition of Jonas' character was great as a team member, and further plot lines in the show itself grew. Finally some results from the shows original main premise, aquiring technology to fight the Goa'uld, is shown in the F-302 and F-303.
The story of the Asguard vs. Replicators comes to an end, and at the end of the season, we get a new sense of direction for the plot of season seven. And as for season seven, while some of its episodes are mediocre, most of the newer ones are awesome(like Grace and Evolution part II), and the finale is going to be like watching a theatrical movie, becuase that is what it was intended to be.
The DVD looks great, plenty of these ""Directors"" featurettes, whatever they are, and audio commentary on each episode. Widescreen is still looking good also.",1073952000,63,1069,4.572916666666667

1972331,3,B00015HVI8,"In Season 6, Daniel Jackson was replaced by the ultra-irritating Jonas Quinn (and if you watched season 5 you know why his inclusion on the team was so controversial with the fans!)  Also, TPTB would have done better to have him bring a different skillset to the table instead of cranking out an unconvincing ersatz Jackson.  (They did much better job with Ben Browder & Claudia Black in the last 2 seasons; the characters they played were far more interesting and engaging than Jonas Quinn!)

1972380,5,B00015HVI8,"This show is really fun Sci Fi.

It's got comedy from Jack as he handles tough situations with grace and jokes. It's got drama. It's got action. It's just good all around entertainment.

I didn't watch this show when it originally aired. I am seeing it for the first time now, in 2016. That's significant because there have been a lot of changes in television over the past 15 years that could have easily made this 1990's show outdated and unwatchable. Namely the advent of HDTV. Sci Fi in HD is a different experience than Sci Fi in standard definition.

I am happy to say that Stargate SG-1 works despite being a 4:3 aspect ratio (bars on the sides) standard definition presentation. The thing about sci fi is that everything centers around a good story. If you have a good story, older special effects don't matter. That's why the original Star Trek series is still watchable despite the low quality effects and Shatner's acting.

SG1 is a great story. It's fun. It's entertaining. And it takes Gene Roddenberry's approach to sci fi, which is that the story should be about the people, not about the science. The science should be a plot element, not the entire story. That's what made Star Trek work, and it's what makes SG1 work. SG-1 goes pretty light on actual science with all the spaceships that look like Egyptian pyramids, for example. But that makes the story fun.

Each episode is about the people interacting with other species or other branches of humanity. The result is that the cast learns about itself and what it means to be human. Just like Star Trek had Spock and Data and 7 of 9 type characters who were emotionless people that served to highlight the humanity in the rest of the cast, Stargate has T'ealc who's character serves a similar purpose.

It's a very entertaining show and you don't have to have enjoyed it when it originally aired to pick it up and start liking it now.

Watching it on the Amazon FireStick I find the video quality to be good. Again, it's standard definition. There is nothing they can do to increase the resolution. But the color depth is good. The clarity is good for SD.",1477872000,,2125,4.591029023746702

Yes, even Dr. Daniel Jackson in his new form of being. Maybe this time Jonas can ask Dr Jackson questions he didn't understand about Dr. Jackson's work and O'Neil and Carter can finally get married (after an Ori attack of course), T'ealc and his son find piece and T marries Dr. Fraiser.

Jonas Quinn is a fantastic addition to team and has a good quality of judgement that Dr. Jackson, despite moral rhetoric, would often be lacking (such as when he tried to take over the world when he had the knowledge of the goa'uld, as seen in his vision from the Harsesis).

The stories are good gaining both friends and enemies and they contain heading toward the ""Lost City"". I only got to watch the first two seasons when it originally aired. Then years of catching sindicated shows (not always in order). So it has been good for me to go through the whole show.
I am almost through season 7 which will then open me up to SG Atlantis, so I'll have two shows to watch. I love this Amazon set-up.
these are just two shows of how many that I want to watch? I have years of enjoyment and with retirement not far off...

1972812,5,B00015HVI8,"This is definitely an all time great sci-fi series, with its unique blend of science and Egyptian, as well as Norse, mythology. It is definitely a creative triumph and  kept the viewer riveted season after season. Coupled with a great ensemble of actors whose characters mesh seamlessly, along with intriguing plots, it is little wonder that this series was able to stay the course for ten amazing seasons.

Season six wrought many changes, as Michael Shanks went on hiatus, causing his character, that of Dr. Daniel Jackson, to miss most of the season, for reasons defined in season five. Instead,  the character Jonas Quinn,  played by Corin Nemec and previously introduced in season five, would play an expanded role, in effect filling the void created by the absence, for the most part, of Dr. Daniel Jackson. While some viewers had a problem with this, I did not, though it changed the dynamics on the Star gate SG-1 team, as the character of Jonas Quinn is quite different from that of Dr. Daniel Jackson.

Notwithstanding this major change,  season six still rocked, and I was riveted from beginning to end. It was interesting to see that the insidious Replicators were still on the loose in the galaxy and creating havoc. Some things never change. All I can say is that I am hooked and binge watching season after season.",1448236800,,1329,4.807017543859649

1973098,5,B00015HVI8,"I bought this instead of the 10-season set because (a) it was cheaper to buy each season separately and (b) there were reviews of the 10-season set complaining of poorly manufactured disc retainers allowing the discs to be loose and scratched during shipping. The individual season sets do not suffer from this issue.

I loved all 10 seasons of this series, and have enjoyed many episodes more than once, so it was only logical to purchase the entire set to watch again in the future. It's an excellent sci-fi series with immersive plot arcs embedded across the series combined with well-done, entertaining individual episode plots that are easily able to stand on their own. The characters and the story are equally compelling, due to both quality writing and great acting.

If I could make one change about the series, I would have kept Richard Dean Anderson's character in a more prominent role throughout, but I recognize that actors sometimes have to move on. While Ben Browder took some getting used to (mostly just because I missed Anderson's presence), he filled his role well and the series continued to thrive as a result.",1431302400,,1132,4.890625

The long-term Goa'uld storyline progresses very well with Anubis as the main threat.  That along with some smaller storylines makes for a pretty good season in their 6th year.",1419897600,,430,5.294117647058823

1973428,4,B00015HVI8,"I really enjoyed the earlier seasons. I liked this show. I have to say though that it seemed like the writers were running out of material.

It's too bad there are so many shows and movies that are pay per view only when you sign up for Amazon Prime. I was almost shocked but more disgusted when I looked at title after title and series after series that were/are pay per view only and NOT covered by Amazon Prime. Amazon advertises that they provide so many thousands of movies and TV shows that you and I can stream instantly. It's too bad Amazon didn't feel it was necessary to be more honest and up front about the fact that you and I/we have to pay extra money per each movie or episode on the overwhelming majority of what they have to offer. Someone may very well benefit from Amazon Prime but I think it is Amazon who benefits the most. I don't buy that much from/through Amazon and if I want free shipping I can just wait until I have the minimum size order to get free shipping. For me, Amazon Prime is NOT worth what they're asking so I cancelled it. As for Stargate SG-1 I usually do enjoy some sci-fi  and especially so when there are worm holes, time travel and or many alien species. Add to that the constant battle between good and evil with the good side always coming out on top and for me it's a winner. It's too bad I have to miss the last season because I will not pay $99.00 for a service that doesn't provide near as many FREE movies and episodes as the advertising leads to believe. I'll just keep using Netflix as my standby for television viewing. At least they don't try to get me to slip up and pay for movies and episodes. No, Netflix doesn't give me free second day shipping but I could care less. As for free music I already get that elsewhere.",1410739200,,1775,4.2485207100591715

I was pleasantly surprised to find the series again on Amazon Prime. Part of why I like the entire SG-1 series is that it evolves over time from relying just on the Stargate to actually using the technology the teams have garnered over the years and adapting them for their use (such as the Prometheus). The show often pokes fun at itself and other science fiction shows (""Sir, you can't call this ship the Enterprise"") and the myriad subplots are varied enough to keep you curiosity going.",1402012800,,661,4.516666666666667

1973522,5,B00015HVI8,"Season 6 remains at the peak of the Stargate SG-1 series.  Characters fully developed, relations that are dependable and those that you know will fade and reappear.  Stargate had the luxury of a long good run based on the multiple tiered storyline that continues to unfold in Season 6 with the apex yet to come and the decline still ahead.  At some point all long running shows fall into a pattern but SG had a successful one that supported a long, good, run.  Season 6 is still in the midst of the height of the show with good seasons ahead.  It definitely hit a point at which to much change left long term fans falling away, but Season 6 is still a ways away from reaching that point.  The show started a franchise of shows based on the strength of some of those long running story lines and sometimes crossed the line of how much could be kept secret in the information age, but just because a few stories didn't develop that I would have liked to have will not diminish the quality of the show and its long run.  I think season 8 levels off and 9 and 10 are where the decline actually occurs, but I have to re-watch them to assess them.  My opinion is that 6 is still riding the crest of success and quality and the show remains strong for some time yet.",1400716800,,1259,4.260504201680672

Everything else was par for the course - good fun, tongue in cheek portrayals, not taking itself too seriously, but still advancing the mythology.  As far as ranking against other seasons, I would put this one toward the bottom, but even toward the bottom, it is still a great show, as I enjoy even some of the cheesier Stargate,",1392854400,,555,4.485148514851486

1973564,3,B00015HVI8,"Some of our very least favorite episodes occur in Season 6.  It appears to be a combination of Jack being diverted to other places and things, Daniel Jackson having ascended to another plane of existence and being absent for most of the season (with occasional guest appearances), the SG1 teams chemistry losing a lot with the replacement of Daniel Jackson with Jonas Quinn, and some tired writing, some of which felt reminiscent of the X-files and other Sci-Fi series.  In fact, we started to wonder if the entire writing team had left the show-?  For one episode, it must be that none of the main cast were available for shooting because the film editor spliced together scenes from past episodes under a cover story that was so poorly conceived and executed that it made me cranky.  There are still some very good episodes, though, so we watched the entire season, although we groaned at the end of some episodes.

I simply dismissed the series thinking that it could never work because it recast the characters. Having said that, its an awesome show that carries on the Stargate mythos better than a film series could have done. I loved that they added a bit of humour to the O'Neil character which is vastly different from the film version.

What I love especially about the series is how they expand the universe that was somewhat touched upon in the film but never really addressed. If you've never seen the series, pick up the first 3 seasons and get a taste for it...

Its a great show for sci-fi fans and people who enjoy great chemistry between actors.

A winning formula (as is evident by its 10 year run(not including Stargate Atlantis)) was stumbled upon with this show. Including long story arcs, as well as short arcs wrapping up, most of the time, within each episode. While watching Stargate SG-1 i not only enjoyed the story plots, but also the character developments, as well as the first class acting skills of much of the cast. Anyone interested in action sci-fi should most certainly, at the least, give Stargate SG-1 a watch.

1973714,5,B00015HVI8,"Stargate SG1 is a brilliant series.  Television has not seen its like before or after.  Just the right combination of action, humor, heroism, character depth and interplay, along with imagination that is out the kazoo.  Richard Dean Anderson MAKES the series so when he takes a hiatus starting some in Season 7 and 8, and definitely in Seasons 9 and 10, it makes you long for the earlier years of the series - including Season 6.  (RDA wanted to work less so he could be with his young daughter).  But the first 8 seasons are all terrific.  Season 9 and 10 need Anderson.

Season 6 includes one of the best episodes of the entire 8 year series, Abyss.  It is about Jack O'Neill captured by the evil Ba'al who torments him and kills him and revives him over and over in the sarcophagus.  But what makes it special is Daniel Jackson, played by Michael Shanks, who returns in a ""snippet"" role trying to help Col. O'Neill get through the harsh time in which he finds himself.  Daniel Jackson is ""ascended"" so he has ""rules"" as to how much or how little he can help anyone.

Let's just say it's a great episode.  Others in this season are also well done:  Descent, Frozen, the Other Guys, Smoke and Mirrors, Paradise Lost, Full Circle - just to name a few of the really good episodes in Season 6.

Stargate SG1 never gets old.  Wish it could have been followed up with a movie.  RDA and his cast needed to continue to be on screen.  Maybe one day.......",1379980800,2,1448,4.40377358490566

1973902,5,B00015HVI8,"Stargate Seasons in general are excellant watching.
In the two-part season opener the Star Gate is destroyed because of an attack on Star Gate command by Anubis.  In episode 8, (one of my favorites), the brainy combat inept SG scientists, (Feldger, Coombs & Meyers), cowboy on up when the chips are down and perform an impromptu rescue of SG-1; who planned to be captured as part of their mission.  SG-1 gets blackmailed by a reporter from earth aboard the new space-capable ship, ""Promethius"". Polical aspirations on Earth threaten to usurp General Hammond's command, Senator Kensey is assassinated in broad daylight on earth and General Hammond decides to inform Ambassadors from other major Countries on Earth of the Star Gate program's existance.
  Alot of the episodes in season six include earth politics or other planet politics in relevance to the Star Gate program.
  Other episode highlights include SG-1 reviving a frozen 'Ancient' discovered in the arctic and Jack O'Neil consents to become a Tok'ra, in order to thwart a fatal 'Ancient' disease consuming his body. In another episode, Jack O'Neil,(now a Tok'ra), is captured & tortured by  Ba'al.  Everytime O'Neil wakes up revived from death in his cell, an ascended Daniel Jackson appears and speaks to him.
In the lead up to Season 7 Daniel Jackson seems unhappy with ascention and appears to other SG-1 team members in an elevator on the base, asking for help.",1362614400,,1427,5.042553191489362
1973903,5,B00015HVI8,"Season 6 of Stargate was a disappointment to some because we lose Daniel Jackson for a bit.  The stories continue to be strong, however.  Apparently our actor had a movie deal and left (mostly) for the year.  Still, he makes appearances (being ascended) from time to time and his replacement (an Alien with the ability to learn new things quickly) does a fine job.

Really, the season barely misses a beat.  And while Season 9 and 10 changes our cast radically with RD Anderson leaving the main spot (don't consider any of this spoiler alerts since the show's logo include pictures of the actors involved each year), Season 6 maintains our other characters (as well as Daniel Jackson from time to time) so it gets 5 stars from me. Well done.",1362441600,,741,4.625954198473282
1973904,5,B00015HVI8,"I have to say this is on of the best shows ever produced.  So many seasons, and has great action, story lines, and characters.  I have watched this from start to finish many times.

Season 6:
""Redemption"" features a brand new opening sequence, with various shots of the gate spinning, and Michael Shanks' name being removed to make way for Corin Nemec's in between Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis. In most of the shots in ""Abyss"" where Ba'al is talking to O'Neill, Cliff Simon is actually talking to a stand-in for O'Neill and not Richard Dean Anderson due to the limited time Richard Dean Anderson had in which to film the episode. Most of ""Paradise Lost"" was shot at Pitt Lake, near Vancouver.

1973961,1,B00015HVI8,"I never understood the slavish adherence to the idea that the Stargate is a secret to all Earth.  Seems like having a space ship is more a threat to the show's formula than the idea that Earthlings knew about the Stargate.  It's as though that element of the show is the key to everything.  In the end, it simply doomed the show.  There is nothing plausible about it.  There are a lot of people who ask questions and many of them not only don't care what the government thinks about their opinions, they want to confront and challenge the authorities.  Billions of dollars do disappear, but people are not content with ""classifed"" being repeated a thousand times.  This is the weakest element of all of Stargate.  It mystifies me that they kept it up for more than a dozen years.",1329436800,,779,4.514285714285714
1973962,5,B00015HVI8,This is the funniest episode in all Stargate shows together.  The guest stars are very talented.  To see characters who are not as freakishly brave and lethal as SG-1 is refreshing--though the episode ends in that manner.,1329436800,,221,4.945945945945946
1973963,4,B00015HVI8,You want to know how this episode plays out.  From Teal'c's early long gaze at the forest the viewers are kept in tow as the events roll on.  There is suspicion.  There is deception.  And there are questions for the castaways and their foe in the brush.  The achievement of this episode isn't in the intensity of animated explosions.  It is in wrapping the heroes up in a simple struggle to solve a puzzle of strangers in a strange world and see the whole picture for themselves before the lives of friends are lost.  Gate fans must watch.,1329350400,,539,4.438775510204081
1973964,4,B00015HVI8,"Viewers are lead down many different paths even to suspect the hero of being behind an assassination.  Previous story-lines converge to create a condensed thriller of an episode with many satisfying twists and turns.  Sen. Kinsey and the NID are back, as well as some insidious alien technology that seemingly would pose a threat to the basic integrity of the US system of government.  Sam, Teal'c and Jonas are sent to find out who is behind the assassination.  The three heros want to know what means the perpetrators used to kill Kinsey and to frame O'Neill for the murder.  The question of whether O'Neill is guilty is dispelled shortly after the opening credits.  So no time is wasted building suspense in that area.  Instead, the suspense derives from the moot point of proving O'Neill's innocence to the public without the possibility of revealing the Stargate program and all those wacky goings on under Mount Cheyenne (go ahead and quibble with the name).  The conclusion is satisfying and not entirely expected.  We know the fixed cast is not in jeopardy, but the surrounding guest cast is.  Another question is will these lovable allies survive the struggle to expose the evil doers?  Find out by watching it!

The Tok'ra are my favorite good guys.  Too bad they weren't featured in Atlantis ever.  Here they come to the Tauri's aid in reversing the ""cure"" manufactured by another race of human's. They continue to be noble when they find out their founding queen is the source of the cure, has suffered greatly as a result, and is about to pay with her life.

""We thought we had found the cure for all disease, and now it may kill so many of us.""  I thought that was poignant.  It's the historical axiom of unintended consequences.

I had to stop the payment on that which cost me and the representatives from columbia house could not and even refused to commuincate with me to let me know what was happening.

1974023,5,B00015HVI8,"The first five seasons of STARGATE SG-1 were notable for their remarkable consistency not only in quality but in style and substance.  There was, in fact, little actual variation.  But Season Six brought some major changes.  First, Michael Shanks took a year off from the show to pursue his own projects, though he did reappear in a few episodes either as Daniel Jackson or as the voice of Thor.  Second, Daniel Jackson's place was taken by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn, who had appeared in a Season Five episode as a denizen of another planet.  Third, for much of the season the show abandoned episodes that involved them exploring new planets.  They didn't completely skip visiting other worlds, but they did far less than in previous seasons.

Despite these changes, though certainly not because of them, the show remained steady and solid throughout the season.  There were a number of truly superb individual episodes and the show generally maintained the quality that had distinguished it for several seasons.  Corin Nemec did the best he could to fill the gap left by the departure of Daniel Jackson.  To compensate for his lack of education compared to Daniel, the writers gave him an unusual ability to absorb new knowledge.  There were also hints that his physiology was unique in some way that felt as if it would have played a major role in future seasons.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, I suppose), the return of Daniel Jackson to the show precluded the need for Jonas, and he was with only a tiny bit of ceremony shipped back to his home planet very early in Season Seven.  I personally had mixed feelings about Jonas's presence and departure.  He never really meshed with the other characters and never seemed to be a part of the team the way that Daniel had, but on the other hand the way he was so obviously just jettisoned the second he was no longer needed was rather bothersome.  As it was, any attentive fan could sense the abandonment of future plot lines.

The absence of Daniel Jackson in Season Six was definitely felt.  Daniel functioned as the conscience of SG-1, the unapologetic idealist.  He adhered unrelentingly to classic liberal ideals of fairness and justice and was unsparing in his efforts in support of those ideals.  Without him, the team sometimes seemed to be without the focus they had had earlier.  Not that the show ever flagged in quality or interest.  It just felt like a different show.  In many ways, the show felt his absence more than it would feel the absence of other characters who left in Seasons 8 and 9.  There were many good things in Season Six, but Daniel Jackson's absence defined it as much as the more specific things that happened.  The season also increased the number of references to the Ancients, which would lead to major things in subsequent seasons.

No fan of SG-1 would want to miss this season, but it was the harbinger of things to come.  Namely, each season from here on out would bring major changes in the show, with at least one major character disappearing in each of the next three seasons.  The uniformity of Seasons One through Five would give way to an evolving cast of characters.  In a way, one could divide the series into Seasons One-Five and then Six onwards.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just very different.",1152576000,17,3304,4.7272727272727275

I expected this season to be crap because of the loss of Daniel Jackson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jonas was an acceptable substitute. I read tons of reviews saying that Michael Shanks(Daniel Jackson) left the show because of stress and tension, and through commentary on the seventh season premiere, learned that he just left because of his new-born child. His guest star roles were outstanding. The best episodes were: Paradise Lost, The Changeling, and Full Circle. Other great episodes were: Redemption p1 and p2, Descent, Abyss, Shadow Play, Allegiance, Cure, Prometheus(no more Simmons-YAY!!!), Unnatural Selection, Smoke and Mirrors, and Prophecy.

1974029,4,B00015HVI8,"This is the first season without Daniel Jackson as a central character. He does some cameo and guest star work but he is no longer a part of the team. We are not even sure if he is really alive.

This is also the weakest season so far. It is still good entertainment and presents some fun ideas but they seem a little more strained this time around. I don't think this is because of the Jonas Quinn character who replaced Daniel. I've enjoyed watching him trying to establish himself in the team. Its just getting a bit old. I still give it 4 stars but just barely.

Episode synopses appear below.

Redemption Part 1 - The season opens with the SG1 team still in disarray over the loss of Daniel Jackson. They have tried out 8 replacements and none have worked out. The one person who really wants to be on the team is Jonas, the alien who defected to earth at the end of last season with a supply of Naquadria, the new element even more powerful than Naquida. Teal'c receives word that his wife is dying and heads through the gate to attend her passing. He finds his son bitter over the loss of his mother and wanting to prove himself in his father's eyes. The supply of naquadria brought back by Jonas has proved to be a boon and allowed the development of an experimental fighter with hyperspace capability, something even the ghouls don't have. Meanwhile, a wormhole is opened in Earth's gate and nothing comes though. The SGC is unable to shut it down and being open constantly threatens to blow up the earth if the power is not drained off. O'Neill and Carter are sent off in the new fighter to try and get help from the Asgard but it doesn't the hyperspace capability does not work. Teal'c learns that it is Anubis who is attacking the Earth's gate and tries to figure a way to help. Gen. Hammond is having his own problems with the Russian liaison and a primadonna scientist. There are many different small stories here that will have to wait until the next episode to be resolved.

Redemption Part 2 - The Stargate is still set to explode and take the earth with it. Teal'c and his son decide to do a little father and son bonding by taking a ship to the planet where Anubis has his weapon and trying to destroy that weapon. Meanwhile, the crew on earth is trying to figure out how to save the planet. Between Maj. Clark, Jonas and the primmadonna, they come up with a harebrained scheme to use the new fighter to take the thing into space so that it will not be on earth when it goes off. The convolutions making this difficult are too much to get into; watch the episode. Needless to say, things do not work as planned but the Earth gets saved at a price. It looks like Jonas gets to join SG1 and the Russians will have more access to the SGC

Descent - At the close of last season, Anubis had captured Thor and tried to download his mind and knowledge into his mothership. The SG1 crew managed to rescue Thor but not before the damage had been done. Thor is now in a coma and it is doubtful if he can ever be revived. Now, Anubis' mother ship has shown up in the solar system. The good news is that it seems to be deserted but that begs the question of why a perfectly good ghoul mother ship would suddenly find its way to Earth without any ghouls aboard to attack and keep things interesting. The SG1 team heads on over to investigate. They find a derelict with the self destruct activated but on hold for an unknown reason. They also encounter some middle aged, mutant ninja jaffa. It seems that when Thor's mind was downloaded, he managed to sabotage the mother ship and halt the countdown, giving it instructions to head to earth. The ninjas manage to sabotage the sabotage and the ship crashes into the Pacific. Now, it is a race against time to see if the SG1 crew can be rescued before the hull breaches and the ship explodes.

Frozen - In this curious episode, the SG1 team heads back to Antarctica to the site where the alternate Stargate was found. They have found something new. They find a woman but the amazing thing is that dating shows that she is older than humanity: several million years. It is the archeological find that will set everything we know on its head. As the body is removed from the ice, everyone is amazed to find that she is still alive. She is very frightened when she comes to and is in bad shape but she heals remarkably fast. Remarkably, she is one of the few people ever encountered by the SGC who doesn't speak English. She is a fast study, though. She only ever manages to say one word at the very end but she does begin to understand very quickly. On the down side, everyone around her comes down sick. They get worse and worse. The girl show an ability to heal them but each time she does so, she gets weaker herself. There are more people to cure than she can handle. She dies before she gets to Col. O'Neill and it looks like he is done for. The only hope is a Tok'ra symbiote and he can't stand the Tok'ra.

Nightwalkers - I have been referring to the Goa'ould as ghouls because I was too lazy to type the apostrophes. In this episode, we get to see at least some of them as night stalking ghouls with an ambiance right out of the 50s and 60s horror movies. Last season, a billionaire kidnapped Maj. Carter in order to learn more about the ghouls in the hopes that he could be cured of his disease. It did not go well for him. In this episode, we learn that after his death, his company carried on with a line of research cloning ghouls. The experiment has gotten out of control and a small town has been taken over by the ghouls. Two things working in the SGC's favor are that the ghouls are immature and can control their hosts only at night, when they are sleeping and that they are not as bright as they think they are.

Abyss - A recent episode ended with Col. O'Neill on the verge of death and being taken off by the Tok'ra in the hope that a symbiote will heal him. He was completely missing from the previous episode but, in this one, we learn that he and the Tok'ra possessing him have stolen off for unknown reasons. The Tok'ra have been reticent about letting SGC know what is going on but have finally come clean, partially and against their will. It looks like the colonel has been captured by Ba'al, a previously unknown ghoul system lord. As he was captured, the Tok'ra infesting him left his body. Now, Ba'al wants to know what they were doing on his planet. And he is resorting to torture to find out. A normal torture session can be ended with death. O'Neill's problem is that whenever he dies, he is brought back with a sarcophagus and it all starts over again, worse than before. To keep him company, Daniel Jackson puts in an appearance. In order to help him out of this untenable situation, he wants to help O'Neill ""ascend"". The problem is that O'Neill doesn't want to ascend. He just wants to die before he can divulge any information. It is an ugly situation.

Shadow Play - The SGC gets a communication from Jonas' home planet. The political situation on that planet is getting worse. Jonas' country fears invasion by an alliance of its two enemies. They are threatening to make preemptive use of the naquadria bomb. They want to negotiate with Earth for military technology so they will not need to use the bomb. Earth is skeptical. They don't really trust these people. They are, after all, the same ones who tried to frame Daniel Jackson. In a Machiavellian web, everyone has ulterior motives. Things are made more confusing by Jonas' former mentor who claims to want to begin a coup with the aid of a resistance movement. His judgment, though, is not quite right. Nobody trusts anybody else. It seems to be politics as usual. They seem to be trying to draw some parallels with Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project.

The Other Guys - This is a comedy episode. The SG1 team is offworld with a group of scientists. They are all dweebs in the nerdiest sense of the word but one of them has a severe case of hero worship for Col. O'Neill. When the SG1 team is captured by some Jaffa working for Anubis, the geeks take it upon themselves to mount a rescue mission. In the finest tradition of the Keystone Kops, they manage to wreak mayhem at every step of the way until they find SG1, only to learn that SG1 is on an undercover operation. The geeks come through, though, when the original plans fall to pieces. This one is lots of fun.

Allegiance - A Tok'ra outpost is overrun. Because there is not other choice, the SG1 team evacuates the Tok'ra to Earth's alpha site, a planet which nobody has the coordinates for. The site is staffed primarily with free Jaffa. Therein lies a big problem. The Jaffa do not like the Tok'ra. The Tok'ra hate the Jaffa. Col. O'Neill dislikes the Tok'ra but the Jaffa are getting on his nerves too. When a Tok'ra is killed, the rest are sure that a Jaffa did the deed. When the suspected Jaffa is killed, the Jaffa are sure that the Tok'ra have extracted revenge. The situation is getting more and more tense. There is a hidden enemy afoot with a strategy of divide and conquer.

Cure - The SG1 team visits a new planet which is eager for trade and relations. They seem very open and even offer a miracle drug which cures all human ailments in trade. What they want are gate addresses. The problem is that the gate addresses they insist upon are all ghoul home worlds. Even when warned of the danger, they insist that those are the addresses they wish. Teal'c and Jonas stumble onto the source of the wonder drug. They are using ghouls. They even have a ghoul queen. Things are not as they seem, however. The queen is not a ghoul. She is a Tok'ra. Her freedom will condemn to death countless of the natives who are addicted to the drug processed from the bodies of her offspring. It is much less macabre than it sounds.

Prometheus - Maj. Carter is surprised when a reporter confronts her and asks about the Prometheus project, a secret project involving building a new, hyperspace capable ship. She has some of the facts. She has enough to frighten the politicians into letting her take a camera crew on board. They agree to swap exclusive footage in exchange for keeping the story under wraps until the Pentagon is ready to release the information. Nobody is happy with this arrangement but they get less happy when the camera crew turns out to be a bunch of NID rogues bent on rescuing Col. Symmonds and the ghoul who took over the millionaire last season. The hijacking takes place and the SG1 team finds themselves stranded in an unknown location on an experimental ship and now way to get home. It's a cliffhanger.

Unnatural Selection - The previous episode ended with the SG1 team stranded in an unknown position aboard and experimental human ship with no way to find their way home. The Asgard are there to save the day, however, in the person of Thor. The catch is that SG1 has to also save the Asgard. The battle against the replicators is fairing poorly. They have lost their home world. The trap they had set did not work. They want SG1 to fix the problem. They had constructed a bomb to slow down time around the replicators. The idea is that hundreds of years would pass for the rest of the universe while moments passed for the replilcators. Hopefully, that would buy some breathing room. The problem is that the replicators found the device and reversed it. Time for them has passed at an incredible rate and the have evolved. The human role in this is to get to the planet and reverse the time bomb. The assumption is that human technology is so backward the replicators will not see it as a threat.

Sight Unseen - The SG1 crew brings back an artifact from an otherwise deserted planet. It is a high tech piece of equipment but nobody is sure exactly what it is. Not long after their return, Jonas sees an alien bug flit through a wall but nobody else sees it. They think he is crazy until they start seeing bugs as well. It turns out that the device was used by the ancients to study life in other dimensions. It's only used to see; the bugs have no access to our world. The problem is that those who come into contact with the machine start seeing the things. So do those who come into contact with anyone who has been in contact with the machine. This leads to widespread sightings in the civilian community and the SG1 team has to figure a way to contain the secret and reverse the process.

Smoke & Mirrors - The sleazy senator is back. He's back until the first few minutes of the show when he is assassinated. All the evidence, including videotapes, show that Col. O'Neill is the assassin and he is arrested for the murder. It is up to the rest of the SG1 team to clear him but they have very little to work with. Among the clues are memories of the mimic devices aliens used in the episode, FOOTHOLD, to impersonate earth personnel. The other clue is an admission from an NID agent that there is corruption there. As always, money increases the sleaze factor, especially with politicians. What's worse, the sleazy SOB's get even worse when they are cleared.

Paradise Lost - Harry Mayborne, the former NID colonel in hiding, turns up in Col. O'Neill's backyard. He is tired of living on the run and wants a pardon. He says that he has the key to a secret cache of alien technology and weapons located when the NID was running its illicit Stargate program. He agrees to help the SG1 team locate it only if he can go along. The deal sounds too good to be true but Mayborne has been semi-trustworthy in the past so they agree to take him. When they get to the planet and the ""doorway"", he does have the ""key"" device. Instead of just opening it, though, he tries to zap everyone and go through the doorway by himself. Col. O'Neill goes through right on his heels. It turns out that Mayborne thought he was escaping to a sort of paradise. Its true that he couldn't stand running anymore but there never was a hidden cache. Now both of the colonels are marooned in very primitive circumstances with no way to get back. The paradise shows signs of former habitation but nobody is alive there. The SGC cannot locate them and a native plant is causing Mayborne to lose his mind. O'Neill has a hard time not shooting him just on general principles.

Metamorphosis - The Russian SG team comes home with a desperately sick human. The human claims that his race is being wiped out by the ghoul, Nerti. A rescue team goes out led by SG1 and finds a bunch of people who regard Nerti as a goddess who is healing them of a terrible plague. In truth, though, she is the cause of their problems she is using the local peoples as guinea pigs while trying to develop an improved model host. She is changing them drastically and they are dying without her treatments. They are also dying with them. The SG1 team wants to rescue these people but they don't want to be rescued. Instead, they demonstrate telekinetic abilities and capture the SG1 team for further use in Nerti's experiments.

Disclusure - It looks like some of the episodes were running over budget so it was time for a retrospective episode that is made primarily of old footage with minimal new material. Gen. Hammond leads a briefing at the Pentagon for selected foreign ambassadors. In it, he discloses the existence of the Stargate program and makes a pitch for international cooperation in fighting the ghouls but wants the program to remain secret to prevent panic. The ambassadors can hardly believe what they are hearing and, even after they believe, are eager to publicize the program for political advantage. They are aided in this by the slimy senator who sees this as an opportunity to gain control over the program for his own ends. The episode is mostly a bunch of flashbacks as the General and the senator argue about the merits of USAF control.

Forsaken - While investigating a new planet, the SG1 team finds a crashed ship with three human survivors. They are human and are more technically advanced than earth but they have no knowledge of the Stargate system. While discussing with the stranded humans the possibility of fixing the ship, they are all attacked by other aliens. The marooned spacefarers say that these other are barbarians who have been killing and eating them but the colonel is suspicious. He is especially so when they insist on killing all the aliens they encounter and refuse to try and take prisoners. Not all is as it seems.

The Changeling - This is a strange one with more overtones of budgetary problems. Throughout most of it, Teal'c bounces back and forth between being a firefighter (the rest of the SG1 team are other parts of the crew) and being a member of SG1, but with things not quite as they should be. In each state, he thinks he is dreaming and that the other state is the ""real"" one. In each state, he is giving up vital body parts to keep his old mentor, Bray'tac alive. In all states, he gets visited by Daniel Jackson. I say that this one seems low budget not because it is poorly done, but because firefighter sets cost much less than the extravagant Stargate sets. It is otherwise well done, if a little confusing at first.

Memento - The SG1 team is assigned as liaison to the newly commissioned Prometheus ship, the one introduced at the end of the last season as humanity's first starship. They are simple there as advisors, not in a command capacity. While on their maiden voyage, there is a problem with the hyperdrive and no spare parts are on board. They are too far to reach earth and too far from their destination to get help their. Jonas notices that they have popped out of hyperspace near a planet for which they have reason to believe a Stargate exists. They have never been able to reach the planet and surmise that the gate is buried. They decide to go looking for it. The natives are suspicious. The president wants to help them and the military leader thinks they are bent on conquest. They all think of the gate as a myth. The SG1 team and the Prometheus find themselves stuck in the middle of competing political factions and worldviews. It's a good one.

Prophecy - The SG1 team visits a planet where the human population is enslaved by a minor ghoul who is forcing them to mine naqueda. The team is ready to help them throw off the ghoul yoke but there are a couple of problems. Jonas is starting to have accurate visions of the future. The problem is knowing which way to act. This condition seems to be the result of a brain tumor inflicted by one of Nerti's eugenics experiments. The tumor looks like it is going to kill him. Meanwhile, back on the planet, one of the human slaves wants to be a good little toady and gain favor from the ghoul. He betrays SG1. The problem is figuring how to act in light of Jonas' predictions.

Full Circle - While riding the elevator at SG1, Col. O'Neill has encounter with Daniel Jackson who warns him that Anubis is on his way to Abydos to retrieve an extremely powerful artifact, the Eye of Ra. Jackson warns that with the Eye, Anubis will become too powerful to confront. O'Neill is worried that everyone will think he is crazy because Daniel has ""ascended"". They believe him because many of the others have run into Daniel as well. Daniel finally decides to take a stand and help the earth team. In doing so he makes a deal with Anubis to prevent the destruction of Abydos. That is semantically equal to saying he made a deal with the devil. Anubis has been a shadowy figure all season but in this one we learn a little more about him. Its not pretty. On the plus side, it looks like Daniel will be back next season. Also, some more strange plot lines are in store for the future.",1139184000,6,19692,4.445459579180509

As I was going to have major surgery which would lay me up for a couple months, I ordered seasons 1 through 5, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  After the ascension of Daniel at the end of season 5, I just had to continue to see what happened and I didn't want to wait for reruns, so I ordered season 6.

The very first thing I noticed was a substantial improvement in quality!  While 1 - 5 looked great, season 6 looked spectacular, almost HDTV-quality.  The only thing I can attribute it to was the fact that SciFi channel had taken over the series and was perhaps filmed in HD for future broadcasts.

Anyway, I've just gotten started on season 6 and like what I see so far, in both picture, sound, and story quality.  In fact, I like it so much I've bought season 7 as well!",1128902400,7,945,4.216666666666667

I do like Corin Nemic as Jonas but his character does not have the passion that Daniel did when it came to finding relics, ancient dialects and well just in general.
Overall though, the season is great. Some fantastic acting by the whole cast. I think Stargate is unique in the fact that it has a very strong ensemble cast and none are really weaker than the other.
I really look forward to getting my Season 7 boxed set for Christmas and really cannot wait for Season 8 to wrap up and come out in the boxed set.

I watched each season 6 episode through once on TV, and even though I can rewatch every other season over and over again, I have no desire to see season 6 six again. There are a few good episodes in, like Abyss, but far too many dull, pointless ones, like the X-Files rip-off Nightwalkers.

It's the only season I skipped buying the DVDs for. I suggest you do the same.",1103500800,2,535,4.047169811320755

Too bad they couldn't be more imaginative with the execution of this character.  What a terribly unappealing, wooden, and pale imitation of the original character he was supposed to replace.

I wish these episodes would be sold individually.  If I could, I'd pick Abyss (one of the all-time best episodes), The Changeling and Full Circle.  The rest I could honestly live without.

This was Stargate at its worst - no question.  An abysmal season, but ""Abyss"" was worth the price of the set alone - one of the finest hours of Stargate ever.",1099267200,5,674,4.767241379310345

Without Daniel Jackson, the show fell apart.  Boring, bland, plot holes you could drive that ugly spaceship through...yuck.

The team of SG1 isn't a team without the four characters of Jack, Daniel, Teal'c, and Sam. Season six failed to capture my interest with the rebuild of the team. There simply wasn't any chemistry to get me past the weaker episodes or to allow me to ignore the hole where Daniel belonged. The hammer to the head push of the new character just made things worse. So, for me, season six consists of three episodes where SG1 was all present and accounted for.",1093564800,23,632,4.552631578947368
1974044,5,B00015HVI8,"I have always believed that Stargate SG-1 is one of the best things happening on TV, and I see no reason to change my mind now.
There have been rumors going around for a year or so that the final season is near.  Now, with the premier of ""Stargate Atlantis"" on sci-fi the intent of the show's producers is clear - the tablet found at the end of season 6 that speaks of the ""lost city of the ancients"" and all the ensuing related plotlines in season 7 refer to the lost city of Atlantis, and are thus the spin-off point for ""Stargate Atlantis"".
Having said that, season 6 is definitely worth watching for its theme development around the deepening mystery of Anubis.  Although Daniel Jackson makes several appearances, it is also anti-climactic since I have become fond of Jonas Quinn by this time.  In season 6, I think that the character of Sam Carter has been getting a progressively tougher edge since the death of Daniel Jackson, and I'm not sure I like it all that much.  I much preferred the softer, more personable Samantha from the previous five seasons.  Perhaps this character evolution is all related to a higher design for the series?
The DVDs all come with featurettes and supplementary material and options for the home viewer.
Overall, I give Stargate SG-1, season 6 my usual rating of five stars for continuing to be some of the best TV being produced.",1090022400,5,1368,4.590163934426229
1974045,3,B00015HVI8,"The weakness of season 6 is not the loss of the Daniel Jackson character, but the negative & dark shadowing of the story lines.  The stories & plots tend towards the hopeless and destitute, with very few positive or upbeat endings.  Much too much emphasis is put on the ""ascension"" aspect, to the point of wondering of the show has developed a religious agenda. There are a few good episodes in the group, but the only people who would really need this set are the hard core SG-1 fans, or those who just want the complete set.",1087603200,10,526,4.412371134020619
1974046,5,B00015HVI8,"After the Season 5 debacle, I was unsure about what to expect with Stargate SG-1's sixth season.  I was afraid that year 4 would be the peak and that the show ""jumped the shark"" in Season 5.  Fortunately, that was not the case.  Hopefully, the mediocrity (if that's a word) of last year was an isolated incident.
Anyway, the season begins with SG-1 still trying to find a fourth man.  Ever since the death/ascension of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), they have been unable to find a suitable replacement.  Refugee Jonas Quinn (Corinn Nemec) has expressed a desire to join, but Col. O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) never seemed to warm up to the idea.  Also, Anubis (David Paffly) has found a machine created by the Ancients that uses one stargate to destroy another, and he used it to attempt to destroy Earth.  Using the new X-302, a craft capable of aerial combat and intersellar travel, O'Neill successfully avoids disaster, but the Antarctica gate is destroyed.  After that, we don't see Anubis for a while, but the threat of his powers is always hanging over the heads of the SGC.
Anyway, with Jonas as the new member of SG-1, the team embarks on another year of amazing missions.  This year, we see the end of the exiled System Lord Niirti, known for her attempts to create a superior human host through genetic experimentation, we are introduced to some technology of the Furlings, one of the members of the intergalactic UN group who rallied against the goa'uld, Earth's first interstellar capital ship, Prometheus is unvailed, the Replicator threat is ended (I think), and, in one of my favorite episodes, Gen. Hammond (Don S. Davis) discloses the existence of the SGC to representitives of the UK, France, and China.
This year did have a few problems, but the season as a whole made up for them.  Some great episodes include ""Redemption Pts. 1 and 2"", ""Descent"", ""Nightwalkers"", ""Abyss"", ""Shadow Play"", ""Allegiance"", ""Prometheus"", ""Unnatural Selection"", ""Smoke and Mirrors"", ""Disclosure"", ""The Changeling"", and ""Full Circle"", the best episode of the season.",1086480000,6,2068,4.9681159420289855

1974048,5,B00015HVI8,"I like many of the other reviewers, had never seen this show.  Then one Christmas, as a gift and a replacement for Season 1 of Enterprise (not out as of this review) my brother purchased the boxed set of Stargate-SG1 Season 1 fron our local mall.  Being at home, graduating from college, I managed to find some free time to flip on the SCI-FI Channel and caught 3 episodes in season 1 and I was hooked.  I considered buying it from Amazon until I was hinted not to.  Even knowing one of the gifts I got for Christmas did not ruin the excitement when I opened the box.  Since then, I've had that same excitement every time I order a new season from Amazon (2-6).
Some might say that with the departure of Dr. Jackson, the show fell a notch or two, but I disagree.  If Micheal Shanks was unhappy at the time, let him be unhappy, and let the show staff pick someone who will exhibit the excitement I shared above. Coren Nemeck was that person.  Although the staff took a great risk with this action, ignore it because the intriguing plot lines and interesting twists will ""hook you"" regardless of who plays what role.
That being said I would encourage you to do what I did and start at Season 1 so you understand the plot lines and twists.  You'll be glad you did.
A note on Enterprise:  What's the big deal, just because IMO a great show airs on a second rate network doesn't mean it's not great.  Tune in and you would realize that Season 2 was very much like Stargate in the idea that the entire season was focused on character development and ONE plot line.

1974049,5,B00015HVI8,"Great sci-fi is a rarity these days, with too many TV shows (Andromeda, Farscape, the last three Star Trek series) boasting mediocre acting and writing, at best, to go along with admittedly impressive visuals and occasionally very intriguing concepts and plot strands.  Stargate SG-1 is the exception, easily the best sci-fi television series since Star TreK: TNG, and possibly the best ever, period.
With its mixture of intelligent and engrossing stories, terrific acting, cool special effects, and thrilling action, no other show on TV comes close to the combination of quality episodes SG-1 delivers.  Season six, in particular, is quite possibly the best season of the series, though admittedly, this is the only season of SG-1 that I've seen every episode of.  Season six stood out with the addition of Corin Nemec's Jonas Quinn, whom I liked at least as much as Daniel Jackson, probably more.  He was a fantastic addendum, adding much humor and enthusiasm to the show.  It's too bad he was booted off the show by season seven.
Redemption (part I): B+, a terrific premiere episode that presents the first dangerous threat from Anubis.  Drags when it focuses on Teal'c's personal life, but a necessary set-up.
Redemption (part II): A+, quite possibly the best episode of Stargate, period.  It's as suspenseful and exciting as TV gets, and not even David Hewlett's annoying Dr. Mckay can mar it.
Descent: A, that's two absolute winners in a row with yet another one of the all-time best episodes; SG-1 investigates a seemingly empty Goa'uld mothership.  This episode boasts the most in-depth and creepily atmospheric exploration of a spacecraft since Event Horizon.
Frozen: B+, intriguing episode focuses on the discovery of a human enclosed in Arctic ice.
Nightwalkers: B, Invasion of the Body Snatchers-inspired episode about a town that is possessed at night. Derivative, but entertaining and with a few nicely done eerie moments.
Abyss: B-, Jack O'Neill is captured when seemingly betrayed by the Tok'ra symbiote that healed him and has to deal with torture from Ba'al and discovers Daniel Jackson might actually still be alive.  Nothing special plot-wise, but RD Anderson has great chemistry with Michael Shanks, and the prison cell is a cool design.
Shadow Play: B-, decent episode about possible world war on Jonas Quinn's home planet.  The plot twist is quite reminiscent of a certain Best Picture Oscar winner a few years back.
The Other Guys: B+, very funny episode that introduces goofball Felger, who sets out to rescue SG-1 when they're captured by Anubis' forces.  Surprisingly enough, this episode is funny without hampering the excitement.
Allegiance: B, an invisible killer stalks a refugee camp; a bit derivative of Forbidden Planet and Predator, but effective and suspenseful, nonetheless.
Cure: A, a miracle cure called Tretonin apparently has both a horrible side effect and an even more shocking discovery of its origin. This story presents one of the series' most compelling ethical questions and is one of the season's best.
Prometheus: A-, the spacecraft Prometheus is hijacked; another very exciting and suspenseful episode.
Unnatural Selection: B+, SG-1 arrives at a Replicator-overrun planet and discovers some strange inhabitants.  The visit to the planet is atmospheric and the final scene is particularly memorable.
Sight Unseen: B-, a very lightweight episode reminiscent of From Beyond.
Smoke & Mirrors: A-, when Senator Kinsey is killed, all evidence points to Jack O'Neill as the assassin.  Plot-wise, this is one of the most enthralling episodes of the season.
Paradise Lost: B-, an initially very intriguing premise about a hidden cache of weapons and a search for a society that lives in paradise doesn't really go anywhere, but it's still not bad.
Metamorphosis: B, experiments being performed by the Goa'uld Nirrti in search of the perfect host leads to some troubling discoveries on the inhabitants of a planet.
Disclosure: A-, ultimately little more than a clip show, but this episode does an excellent job of relating the history of the Stargate while also portraying the tensions between nations over the SG program.
Forsaken: B+, SG-1 arrives on a planet of stranded pilots that are being hunted by aliens in the forest, but the situation isn't quite as it seems.  The plot twist is fairly obvious, but it's nonetheless a very exciting episode.
The Changeling: C+, probably my least favorite episode of the season, this is one of those ""what is reality and what isn't?"" episodes that's more than a little plodding and tiresome.  It's a nice acting showcase for Christopher Judge, whose Teal'C is experiencing different lives and can't tell which is real, but little else.
Memento: B+, a test flight of the Prometheus results in an accident that strands the crew and SG-1 on the far side of the galaxy.  To get the necessary supplies, they need to find a stargate, but they arrive on a planet that seems unwilling to help.  The lack of trust from the aliens is an interesting twist on the usual ""aliens who arrive on Earth, but are distrusted by humans"" angle.
Prophecy: B, Jonas Quinn gains the ability to tell the future, and must prevent the deaths of Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.
Full Circle: B+, the season finale features the return of Daniel Jackson, who warns SG-1 that Anubis is in search of an artifact that could make him virtually invincible.  The episode boasts a nice return to Abydos (the planet that ""started"" it all, if you've seen the movie), a welcome guest star role from Alexis Cruz, and some first-rate action sequences.",1085097600,10,5588,5.081877729257642
1974050,5,B00015HVI8,"I tuned in to this show on Showtime when it first aired.  I only paid for Showtime, so I could watch this show.  I quickly dumped Showtime when Stargate SG-1 switched to the Sci-Fi Channel.
As for the episodes - beginning with Season 1, I felt it didn't have the best start with the emphasis on Sam being the female with the overreactive, defensive attitude, but that quickly faded.  The show grew to be one of my favorite shows.  This show just gets better and better, and I love that they pick up on previous story threads.  I was always a big Star Trek NG fan, but the characters' apparent amnesia sometimes after very emotionally charged previous episodes drove me bonkers.  These characters change and are affected by what they go through.  I love the story ideas, but the characters and their interactions really make the show.
Although I was sad to see Daniel Jackson go for Season 6, Jonas Quinn was a great addition.  I wish he could some how have become a regular character (like having him on the Atlantis spin-off, but oh well) when they brought Daniel Jackson back.  My husband prefers Jonas Quinn to Daniel Jackson, but I love both of the characters and was kind of conflicted about Jonas leaving.

1974052,5,B00015HVI8,"Not being a Showtime subscriber, I had never heard of Stargate until a couple of years ago.  While channel surfing I came across reruns a few times. Since I love good Sci-fi, I watched a few minutes each time. I was totally unable to understand what was going on, it always seemed as though I was coming in at the middle of the story without knowing who, what, where or when. Fortunately, my son started watching some of the earlier shows and began to get hooked.  He asked me to get the original movie and year one of the series, which had just come out.  Knowing him to be a young man with good taste, I bought them the next day.  He and I started watching, then my daughter and finally my wife.  Within 2 weeks we were all hopelessly addicted.  We since have purchased and watched years 2 through 6 and watched year 7 on the Si-Fi channel.  I'm the type of person that sees a movie and doesn't want to see it again for about 10 years, but this program I can watch over and over again.  I said it is the BEST TV series ever and it is, nothing else even comes close.  I don't mean just the best science fiction series, I mean the best series of any genre.  It has a perfect mix of action, drama and comedy.  The character development has been excellent, you begin to feel you know Jack, Sam, Daniel, T'ealc and all the characters personally.  The plot lines have evolved throughout the series, continually building and developing.  That is why I couldn't pick up on the show and appreciate it in the beginning.  In our instant society few if any other programs have any real depth.  I have begun to evangelize my friends, offering to lend them my DVD's.  So far everyone who has taken me up on my offer has become equally hooked. I hope that this show runs forever and that the rumors about season 8 being the last are false.  I'm also hopeful that Stargate Atlantis will be of the same quality. If it is a tenth as good, it will be the second best program on TV.",1081296000,17,1964,4.264864864864865
1974053,4,B00015HVI8,"The 6th season of SG-1 has some great episodes, but is more for the hardcore fan than the casual one given the advancement of several plotlines at once.  I say this as someone who didn't start watching the series until midway through season 5; until I'd had a chance to catch up through the DVD sets and SciFi network marathons many of the plots just didn't make much sense as standalone work.  Comprare this to the first few seasons - where the team is more intent on exploring the galaxy, and as such the producers must give you enough background information in the episodes to keep up - and it's the primary reason I take one star off on this year.
That said, there are some classics in the season in which actors finally get to act - one of the few valid critiques of a great series in which plot has usually taken precedent over individual accomplishment.  Abyss is the first episode in seasons in which Richard Dean Anderson, confronted with being killed over and over again, has to show depth in his repeated encounters with Michael Shanks as his one potential escape route.  The Other Guys probably made many scifi fans cringe as they saw a little too much of themselves in the geeky guest stars (John Billingsley, Dr. Phlox of Enterprise fame) rescuing the mighty SG-1 team.  The Changeling gives a great acting platform to Chris Judge as Teal'c confronts an alternate universe for himself - and you finally get to see what Chris Judge acts like when he goofs off.  And of course, Full Circle is one of the outright best episodes of the series as two or three plotlines finally resolve themselves and Michael Shanks returns.
I'll echo what has been said elsewhere - the media quality on this set is actually quite good, especially compared to season 1, where my DVD player has had problems.  My only gripe - one that I've had for several of the DVDs - is I wish they'd included more outtakes and behind the scenes work.
Net net, clearly worth a buy if you're a decent fan.",1081036800,7,1981,4.516759776536313
1974054,5,B00015HVI8,"*HEART POUNDING! TENSE! EXCITING! CAPTIVATING! EDGE OF the SEAT!
ADDICTIVE!
YES! YES! YESSS!!
Even though we have the `death' of Dr. Daniel Jackson, we see him so often that he is not really missed. The new team member Jonas, blends in well and brings his own touch to the show. Refreshing.
WOW! It seems like the writers finally woke up and remembered the reason for the STARGATE and the reason for SG-1. Exploring NEW worlds, obtaining technology to fight the Gaou'ld  [? Spelling? ]. Making new friends.
I especially like the episode DISCLOSURE when the existence of the Stargate was revealed to other nations. [About time I thought]. Even though this was a `clip' show, it was interesting, exciting and even funny. The ending was in a word `checkmate'.
These series reminded me of the earlier series of adventure and excitement. A lot better than season 5 with its soap opera style wishy washy shows.
THIS IS A DEFINITE must HAVE.

When I reached the last episode, I delayed washing it for about 2 weeks...just to savour the final episode and it was well worth it! True Sci-Fi.
WELL DONE SG-1, ""Impressive... most impressive""",1080691200,3,1129,4.814432989690721
1974055,5,B00015HVI8,"I have learned to expect TV shows to become less fresh, maybe boring, after five or six years.  Not this one.
One of my favorite parts of this series are the off-world episodes where SG-1 meets usually primitive cultures outside the main storyline.  These remain as strong as ever in season 6.  As do the Earthbased villian episodes, and while our buddy Apophis has been [very likely] dead for a while, the Goa'ulds that filled his power vacuum are not any nicer... (a good thing)
We thought we lost Daniel.  We didn't.  Instead of losing an influential character, we gained another great one (Quinn).  And though this season may not have the serious-while-sidesplittingly-whimsical episode like Wormhole X-Treme! or Window of Opportunity, wow, aside from possibly a slight decline in humor this series is as strong as ever in season 6.",1080518400,,836,4.935714285714286
1974056,5,B00015HVI8,"My favorite show in the world is Stargate SG-1.  Because I didn't start watching the series till halfway through season 6 i was pretty much out of the loop on most of the stuff, so when I found that they were selling the DVDs of the series I was so excited.  The DVD extras are great for this season, the have commentaries for each episode (they alwyas have the director there and usually the visual effects guy, and sometimes they get some of the actors in there to talk about the epsiodes to!).  They also included ""The Director's Series"" on some of the discs where they gave the directors hand cameras and had them shoot some behind the scene stuff, that was awesome.
And of course as always the episodes are amazing.  If you haven't gotten all of the seasons yet, I recomend that you do.  Every season has had supurb episodes and I will be very sad when the day comes that they (heaven forbid) cancel the show.
So in short if you like the show you need these DVDs.  Your really should get them from Amazon.com  they have the BEST prices on the sets that I have seen anywhere.  I have bought the last two seasons from them and had them ship in next day and the amount that I paid on Amazon.com with shipping is less then I was paying in store.",1080518400,2,1246,4.272340425531915
1974057,5,B00015HVI8,"People new to Stargate fandom often have the unfortunate view that everyone who watched Season 6 hated it because Daniel wasn't there. Therefore it doesn't even get given the chance, simply because the actor *chose* to leave the show.
The opinion of Season 6 minus Daniel = Horrible is only that of a very vocal minority. Don't let it put you off watching this amazing season.
Season 6 is very different in tone, storyline and effects. But it's in no way any less wonderful.
The actors have a peppiness that makes you realise how much they love their job. Richard, Amanda, Chris, Don and Teryl light up the screen, and Corin Nemec brings a refreshing and very welcome change.
Storylines are (for the most part) intriguing, interesting and gripping.
And the effects? Just wow.
I'd reccomend this season to fans old and new, young and old. Let the best Sci Fi show on TV draw you in like it has so many others. Spread the love of the show, for it's still not getting the recognition it deserves.",1079568000,9,993,4.584269662921348
1974065,1,B00015HVI8,"I was disappointed when I heard that Michael Shanks would be leaving the series after the fifth season but since Jack has always been my favorite character I figured I could deal.  Sure I missed Daniel but I still wanted to watch season six for Jack, Sam and Teal'c. But while I still enjoyed watching them - especially Jack - the season was pretty much ruined for me by the total waste of space called Jonas. I tried really hard to like him.  I WANTED to like him. But I found him so annoying and dull. He sucked the life out of every scene and just didn't seem to have that same spark and chemistry with the rest of the characters that Daniel always had. I found that the episodes I enjoyed most were the ones he wasn't in much.  If only they had gone with a three person team I think I would have enjoyed the season a lot more and would have given it a higher rating.  All I can say is thank God TPTB came to their senses and asked Michael Shanks back and gave Jonas a one-way ticket back to Kewlona.",1079481600,13,1003,4.128205128205129

1974068,3,B00015HVI8,"Season Six and Season Ten were the worst seasons of Stargate SG-1. Not only did we miss out on Daniel Jackson (for the most part), having an ""alien"" like Jonas Quinn that was more American than the Russian team members in ""Metamorphosis"" was inexcusable. In that episode, by the way, the Russians pass through the Stargate and still speak Russian. (If the stargate programmed one's speech, or language, to match the worlds to which it was connected, it should have made the Russians perfectly easy to understand once they had passed through its event horizon.) But the Russians couldn't communicate with the world's inhabitants while the Americans could.

The best episodes were the ones with guest appearances by Michael Shanks. Jonas pulled down the season, but it's still worth owning, even if one has to swallow an ""American"" alien.

Dumb idea, but the show recovered and even survived the addition of the insufferable Ben Browder and Claudia Black, who, unlike Browder, grew on you.",1078704000,,987,5.012195121951219
1974069,5,B00015HVI8,"As I've only watched Stargate as it has come out on DVD, I had no idea what to expect from season six, especially with several of my Daniel Jackson-obsessed friends bemoaning his loss during this season's run.  But Jackson or no, season six is a remarkable addition to the Stargate timeline.
The first few shows of the season are in that uncomfortable place of having a few very good elements (the introduction of Jonas Quinn, for me, being one of them) and a few rather questionable ones (as in the episode ""Frozen,"" where the A-story of finding the preserved body of an apparently 'ancient' advanced human is taken over by the B-story of how this human carries a deadly virus, the episode ending up focusing more on how to cure the virus, forgetting entirely about *explaining* the virus and the human who carried it).
However, with the episode ""Nightwalkers,"" with its stylized cinematography and old-school body-snatchers storyline, the season comes into its own, and the episodes that follow only get more interesting.  Viewers will need a fairly keen memory of shows in seasons past as nearly every episode relies on information learned years ago, but I believe the shows hold up nicely on their own as well, simply through the sophistication of the show's ability to put new twists on classic SF and general drama plots.
Not to mention, the show begins to more openly acknowledge and poke fun at other classic science fiction shows, such as Alf (mentioned in ""Sight Unseen"") and Star Trek (particularly in the episodes ""Unnatural Selection,"" in which O'Neill suggests calling their new spaceship the 'Enterprise,' and ""The Other Guys,"" in which two bumbling scientists try to play heroes and end up nearly ruining an undercover mission-- look for the Klingon Bat'leth used as a random set-decoration in the Goa'uld/Tok'ra's throne room).
Stargate fans tend to be very critical of Corin Nemec and his character Jonas Quinn, as he is technically the season six replacement for Michael Shanks's Dr. Jackson, but Jonas is a refreshing change in the line-up.  Where in seasons four and five, Jackson came off as slightly bitter, bored, and morose (seemingly reflecting Shanks's own attitude at the time), Jonas is optimistic, curious, and energetic, and provides a good counterpoint to O'Neill, Carter, and Teal'c and their team dynamic.  Much as I like Daniel, it actually makes me sad that Corin Nemec left the show when Shanks asked to come back in season seven.
The production values of the show in season six are stellar, with solid scripts, cinematography, directing, sound editing, soundtrack, and, most notably, special effects.  Looking back at season one, Stargate has come a long way in what they are capable of in the realm of computer graphics.  Of course, the slightly under-whelming Asgard puppets are still dragged out on occasion, but the writers have enough self-awareness to let the characters make fun of the suddenly non-CG Asgard (from ""Unnatural Selection""-- O'Neill: ""I thought you were going for a new body."" Thor: ""This is my new body.""  O'Neill: ""...Right."").
The DVD set for this season is also leaps and bounds ahead of the past collections.  The digital transfer is beautiful, and holds up well on a 43"" LCD flatscreen, owing to the improved method of filming used in Stargate's production begun in season five.  The 5.1 Dolby sound is, as usual, more than adequate.  The DVD finally includes the actual opening sequence used in the airing of the show, instead of the 'cross-eyed Ra' opening from the Stargate film that was inexplicably used for the past few seasons.  The graphic design for the DVD cases and menus has finally been updated and looks more subtly sophisticated than before, though using a font for the episode titles that looks strangely like the one used by Lucasfilm for the titles of the Star Wars prequels (a moot point, I know, but strange nonetheless).  The Directors Series featurettes included for almost every episode are a welcome addition and a nice attempt at reaching out to the DVD audience, some of them providing amusing and/or unique looks into the production, others doing little more than recapping the episode and showing a few moments from the other side of the camera.  The inclusion of audio commentaries once again (as done in seasons four and five) is equally welcome, and provide both insight (from directors, writers, actors, visual effects supervisors) and humor (particularly from director Peter DeLuise and actor Gary Jones, who plays the recurring character of the nearly-nameless technician, who has appeared in every episode since the beginning of the series).
Compared to the often-dull seventh season of Stargate currently running (where B-stories consistently eat their A-stories, and Richard Dean Anderson is barely an on-screen presence) and the horror that has become of the Star Trek franchise, ""Enterprise,"" season six is looking to be the pinnacle of current televised science fiction.

When one member of the team is in trouble, the rest are there to help at any cost. In ""Abyss"", Daniel Jackson returns to his friend's (Colonel O'neill)aid as he is being tortured. Back on Earth, the rest of the team desperatly tries to figure a way to get their firend home. This is just one example of the many great episodes you will find in this season.
