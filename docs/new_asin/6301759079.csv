356788,5,6301759079,'Carousel' is certainly the best and curiously least appreciated of R & H musicals put on film.  This movie possesses a poetic beauty rarely captured in movies (especially nowadays).  Shirley Jones and Gordon MacCrea  are captivating as Julie and Billy.  And Henry King adapts the story for  the screen far better than did Fred Zinnemann with 'Oklahoma' the year  before. A must to own on DVD!,947462400,7,393,4.878787878787879
356789,4,6301759079,"Not as good as the other Rodgers and Hammerstien screen adaptions but still worth while. Brilliant scoring by Alfred Newman and wonderfully sung by the leads. Photography is often breathtaking (especially in widdescreen  version). Unfortunatly there was much post production tampering. Two songs  were cut (""Blow High, Low"" and ""Your a queer one Julie  Jordan"") and others shortend. Also the screenplay departed somewhat  from the original stage version in an attempt to ""lighten"" up the  subject matter. The performers do not act as well as they could sing. Jones  is good, but McGrae seems to be in over his head. A stonger director could  have worked wonders. Yet despite its faults, ""Carousel"" is still  much better than many of the other ""Broadway to Hollywood""  transfers. Perhaps we just expected too much. Anyhow buy this in wide  screen and enjoy the glorious score and visuals.",925862400,5,887,5.097222222222222
356790,3,6301759079,"However one can quibble with the film itself - Jones too young as an actress and MacRae too old and charmless for the complex leads, some very static camera work, some stilted acting,the score makes this a must-see  adaptation and the THX restoration in both pan and scan and widescreen  versions is the definitive one.  The compositions are memorable and far  more accessible than those in THE KING AND I on video (as most shots are  half shots as opposed to long shots) making facial expression more easy to  read.  The beautiful widescreen backgrounds of location work in Boothbay  Harbor, Maine and Carmel, California give the eyes something to feast on  when the dramatic content of a scene is not up to par.  The DeLuxe color is  restored to richness and brightness and the print is crisp and clean -  altogether the finest print we have seen of the work.  This may be the  original premiere print as the CinemaScope extention logo reads  ""Introducing CinemaScope 55"" - not seen on any other print I've  been exposed to.  Note: The original 55 millimeter process was abandoned  early in the filming, settling for conventional 35 millimeter with Scope  lens conversions, but the ads and campaigns were all set with the 55  process announced, so it was released with some not quite truthful hype.  Comparing the wide screen version to the pan and scan, it is amazing to see  so much of the richness of composition lost in the former - especially the  first shot of Louise running along the beach in twilight.  Fully half of  the screen (the right half) is forfeited and a breathtaking moment in  lighting is lost.  This restoration is the definitive version - not since  the premiere has there been a brighter, truer, more colorful print  available.  Run out and buy BOTH the pan and scan and the widescreen  version of this memorable restoration.",921110400,8,1851,4.762658227848101

356855,5,6301759079,"Some reviewers have made negative comments about the ""color balance"" of the digital transcription of ""The King and I"". in this set. Rest assured, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the colors of this transcription. What they fail to understand is that this was filmed as a musical stage performance. Standard theatrical stage lighting practice is for there to be cool tones (blues) coming from lighting aimed from one side and warm tones (reds) to be aimed from the other side. This enhances apparent depth. You will see exactly this convention if you attend a live stage performance to this day. In the movie the actor's faces will appear to be warmer or cooler in tone depending on exactly where on the stage they are standing and which way they are facing. If facing toward the ""audience"" their face will be bluer on one side and redder on the other. However, on the big screen a viewers apparent distance from the actors is much less than it would be in an actual live theater, so the effect will appear more pronounced.",1517356800,,1028,4.685082872928176
356856,5,6301759079,"Carousel is one of the greatest musicals every filmed.  The stars and supporting cast are all excellent singers or dancers.  It is the tragic story of a nave young woman who marries a handsome man lacking principles, and they don't express their mutual love until it's too late.  There are two climaxes: the tragic one and the ending one.  Both climaxes bring tears to the eyes.  The songs are all very good, and some are sublime.  The soundtrack is the best I have heard on film, with every word of dialogue and song being crystal clear.  It is a very poignant movie.",1517184000,,568,4.509803921568627

356858,5,6301759079,These are some of our favorite musicals - that dates us as we saw the originals - Fun to see how different they are - example of the great changes in American culture - Now Oklahoma seems a bit 'corny' but still fun. Too bad they did not have Ezio Pinza for South Pacific - no singer like him.,1516147200,,293,3.983050847457627
356859,3,6301759079,"These movies weren't as exciting as the clips in the ad that made me buy the set.

I did not watch State Fair.  Couldn't take that much goodness.  Heard enough of the conversation with Shirley Jones.  Learned from it that Frank Sinatra was supposed to play Billy in Carousel (good grief!) and only didn't because he got mad about something and walked out.  Also that he was supposed to play Harold Hill in Music Man, but Wilson threatened to pull out if he did.  Hollywood's brain is in its wallet!  Stopped listening to the conversation in disgust during the praises heaped on Hammerstein.  I think after Oklahoma! Rodgers and Hammerstein dragged each other down.  When he wrote Oklahoma!  Hammerstein said he was in the shadow of Larry Hart and never wrote better.  I agree.  I also think Rodgers' music for Oklahoma! was so good because he was still in or fresh from his years with Hart.  I was never a fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and I'm still not.

Only The Sound of Music and South Pacific were as long as a show. The others were shortened to about 2 hours with songs left out.  Sound of Music left out lots of song too.  Rodgers by himself (Hammerstein was dead) wrote two new ones.  South Pacific kept all the original songs plus one (My Girl Back Home) that had been dropped from the show.

Sound and picture on all discs were fine.

Carousel (Rodgers' favorite of all his shows - he was a Billy Bigelow himself!) is the ugliest show they wrote - the domination of a woman by a cruel man - and her endless ""love"" for him - and the clambake scene - the clams and lobsters steamed to death and then eaten by all these darned nice folks who ""aren't in a mood to putter"" - and kindly, poetic Hammerstein wrote the lyric for this  trash - Though the end when Billy tells Julie that he loves her and always did and she somehow hears him - redeems the whole weepy debacle - and I cry - just I guess as I am supposed to.",1516147200,3,1925,4.324022346368715

356912,2,6301759079,"I have adored this musical since I was a child.  The two stars is for the editing and censorship.  Please note that this version is missing some of the most emotional scenes.  They cut the scene where Billy hits Carrie, followed by  her singing He's Your Fellow and You Love Him afterward.  Such editing of classics to remove currently offensive material sanitizes them in a way that they no longer resonate as they used to. At least let us know when you edit for political correctness.

357031,4,6301759079,"At one time or another I remember seeing most of these films growing up. My mother had this set so I thought I would take a trip down memory lane. There are multiple copies of the films but I only stayed with the ones I remembered.

I started with State Fair which had two version of the DVD.  I found I liked the older black and white version better then the one with Ann Margaret. The original had a tighter story and characters you just well....liked. The 1962 version seemed like many shots bound together.

Next was Carousel. Never one of my favorites and I was reminded why. I think there could have been more to the characters but this was a musical so character development was given way to music.

Then came Oklahoma. Not a favorite of mine but not one I would avoid.

After that was South Pacific.  I did like this film though the ""Color Blast"" shots did get annoying at times. Probably very cool in the films day but now the effect is not as striking.

Then came the two best; The Sound of Music and the King and I. What I could say for these films has been said many times. The only thing I would throw out is that for their age; they still hold up with time.

As mentioned there are extras but I was not interested in them. Well, actually I did watch the ones for The Sound of Music and the King and I.  I was interested in the background pieces and was surprised to learn the original Maria Von Trapp had a cameo in the film.

Overall, a nice trip down memory lane. But, I am not an ardent fan of musicals so I will not pick up this set (I can always borrow it again if the urge arises ;) ).",1493510400,,1605,4.115384615384615

357142,4,6301759079,"I confess that I didn't like the opening sequences of this film as much as I did in other Rodgers and Hammerstein's musicals. The beginning of Carousal is kind of awkward because it uses background music to show the moment in which the major characters, Billy Bigelow and Julie Jordan, fall in love with each other at first sight at the carousel. It is a very slow beginning when compared to the other R&H films. Yet, once it starts, it is quite a beautiful musical. Not only the songs are beautiful, but also the ballets that appear, June is Bustin' All Over Ballet and Louise's Ballet, and the songs that are sung with a chorus, Blow High, Blow Low; A Real Nice Clambake; Stonecutters Cut It on Stone; What's the Use of Wond'rin'; You'll Never Walk Alone. The ballets and the choruses are things that I personally enjoy very much in a film. The film's restoration is also a great job and helps appreciate the film's quality.

There is also a second disc with special features and an earlier French film based on the same story, titled Lilliom. Although one has to watch this film with French subtitles, it is quite interesting to watch. So, I think this is a great buy for musicals lovers.",1482624000,2,1191,4.53953488372093

Carousel did not go over very well in the 50's because of the death and the ghost coming back.  Too dark for they day.  Fast forward 60 years and we see a wife beater, a wife neglector, and a man who slaps his child's hand for not accepting his gift, even though he was a stranger to her.  To add insult to injury, one of the songs say even though they were hit, it didn't hurt.    Jigger was a jerk.

So that was a real distraction.

R&H were at the top of their game and the wonderful songs come almost one right after the other. Gordon MacRae's powerful voice is perfect for this role. He had effortless range and spot-on phrasing. Shirley Jones brilliantly plays the a naive girl in love, with just a little streak of stubbornness to make her character interesting. And her voice--an angel. There's enough dramatic suspense in the plot so you don't get bored waiting for the next song or dance number. The video and audio quality are good considering the age of the recording.",1462924800,4,639,4.818181818181818

The music is in my opinion the best ever written by R&H, with ""The Carousel Waltz"" and songs like ""If I Loved You,"" ""Soliloquy,"" ""A Real Nice Clambake,""  ""Mr. Snow,"" ""When the Children Are Asleep,"" and, of course, ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" It is a great story, but don't expect laughs. This is a drama of operatic quality and breadth. The story won't appeal to everyone. I watch it rarely, but mostly for the exquisite songs, and thus usually listen to the CD of the music. I could listen to it over and over again.",1462665600,6,687,4.4523809523809526

The storyline is horrible - nothing redeemable about either character, when it comes right down to it - she's weak and driven by hormones, he's a lout and driven by hormones. Trying to turn them into sympathetic characters loses it for me.

And the scene where the mother and daughter stare off over the camera in wondrous reflection that 'a hit is just like a kiss' is danged uncomfortable, at best.

But musicals aren't really about the storyline.

Four tunes that have become iconic:  ""If I loved you"", ""June is Bustin' Out All Over"", ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", and the opening ""Carousel Waltz""

In the last scene Billy Bigelow strikes his daughter hard on the hand but she tells her mother it felt like a kiss. The girl asks, can blows not hurt and her mother who was beaten several times by Bigelow, says thats right; in effect saying beatings by a loved one must be accepted.

The cast is magnificent (with the slight exception of Gordon MacRae who was a great singer but not much of an actor). If you like classical musicals, this is a must-see.

359045,5,6301759079,"I love this movie. I was very young when it was first released, but it had an impact on me that I have never forgotten. The film has been criticised for the one major change it made from the stage play. We know from the opening that Billy has died in the film, whereas in the show you don't. I think this makes the story even better, because we want to know what happened. And the opening sequence in heaven is brilliant. Frank Sinatra famously walked out when he realised he would have to film each scene twice for the two film processes, but Gordon McRae is wonderful. Billy needs to a be a hot number, which Frank, apart from his sensational voice, wasn't. The entire cast is perfect. Audrey Christie is wonderful as the older other woman, and Rod Alexander's recreation of Agnes de Milles famous ballet is excellent. I would love the trimmed footage back, but it's never going to happen. It's not without it's problems however. Barbara Ruick is a pain in the neck, weeping and whining away in the background, and Susan Luckey, who was a terrific dancer, is a bit charmless as Louise, but the score is one of R&H's best.",1408492800,,1123,4.456310679611651

A week or two ago, it was  ""If I Loved You"" from ""Carousel,"" which I hadn't seen in years.  That song was still rambling around in my head a couple of days later, so I came here and ordered the movie on DVD. While I'd never cared all that much for the story, I'd always liked the music and Gordon MacRae's baritone voice.

He has really good feet and mine are lame, so I'd admire him very much, still do. As an in the closet gay man, growing up in rural Nevada, TV was the only way of seeing others. I had and perhaps still do, have a crush on him, he is so handsome and has good feet, something I don't.

359359,3,6301759079,"I liked the movie, overall, however this is not a movie for youngsters. I have a 10, 7, and 5year old and I regret letting them watch it. We enjoyed the few dancing scenes they have in the movie, but it is just not appropriate for kids. For beginners, the movie starts with the guy being in heaven, so the whole movie you know that there will be some point that he dies. There are a few scenes that are as though the men are making inappropriate passes at the women, like they are out in the woods, and it just seems not right. Like I said, it is ok for an adult, but not ok for a kid. Then the part where it finally shows him dying, ok I will give this, it's not gory and horrifying, but it is just tough on the little guys to see and then understand. For the last 25 mins of the movie, if not more, he is a ghost and is going back to talk to them in the human world. AGAIN, NOT ok for kids!! The love part of the movie is even sad because it is still not obvious that they are truly in love, until the end when he is a ghost and admitting to her that he really did love her. I do love the song from the movie, IF I LOVED YOUgood tune, and very catchy, we sang it in Choir in school. I would prefer watching a Doris Day movie again or another classic, then to watch this one ever againglad I saw it once, that was enough for me (which says a lot because I am a old classic movie junkie)!!!",1393632000,,1390,3.8636363636363638

359439,5,6301759079,"This collection includes much more than was expected. We were expecting one copy of each of the listed titles but found, to our pleasant surprise, that all but one title was inclusive of multiple versions of that title.
 The Carousel title is inclusive of the American version of the movie, from the 1950s, plus Liliom, the French language, English subtitled, 1934, B&W version, upon which the American version of Carousel was based. Prior to seeing this, we were not aware of the 1934 video.
 The State Fair title includes the 1945 version, with Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, Vivian Blaine and Jeanne Crain in the lead roles, as well as the 1962 version, with Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Pamela Tiffen and Ann Margaret in the lead roles. Those familiar with the title will remember that there was an earlier, B&W version, from around 1933, with Will Rogers, as the family patriarch but I don't recall the other players. That 1933 version was not included in this DVD set. While the 1933 and 1945 versions retained the venue of State Fair in Iowa, the 1962 version chose to change the venue, to Texas, for no discernable reason. Each of the three versions has its strengths and weaknesses and each kept to the basic plan of the story but with wide variations, in the details and side issues.
 The South Pacific DVDs includes the Broadway version, at 157 minutes in length, as well as the road show version, which ran for 172 minutes.
 The first of the two Sound of Music DVDs contains the video, while the 2nd DVD contains a special introduction, by Julie Andrews, as well as additional background info, about the show, the characters, the von Trapp family and, for some reason, a Mia Farrow screen test.
 The Oklahoma DVDs contain the Broadway version of the video, on disk one, plus the slightly longer and full screen/wide screen, Todd-AO version, on disk two.
 The King and I also provides 2 DVDs, with disk one being the play and disk 2 providing interviews with the players, plus background info, about the show and performances.",1393200000,21,2028,4.730878186968838

359496,4,6301759079,"As a musical theatre vocal coach, I have collected nearly all the major musicals releases.  The Rodgers and Hammerstein collection is indeed for the value asking the definitive collection..  South Pacific, Sound of Music, Carousel, State Fair, King and I and Oklahoma.

The irritation?  The transfers to dvd are not consistent, I was rather annoyed to see that State Fair was in a widescreen different medium.  No consistency.  No major extras, no historical liner notes/booklet. In other words you get the complete collection, but mediocre packaging like these titles were thrown together quickly.

I'm a bit insulted as I feel with such great movies they could have created more extras, etcs. But you get what you pay for.. so if you want the basic essentials.  This is a value buy.

State Fair has both the 1945 and the 1962 versions, and I again enjoyed watching them with no commercials!

Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein are the Verdi's, Puccini's, and Mozart's of our century!
I don't mean to diminish the fine work done by Sondheim, Lloyd-Weber, and their contemporaries, but the contrast of achievement is just too great to put the latter group in the same category (my opinion).
Few can put the best possible words and music together to so EXACTLY capture a moment or emotion.
The acting in all is also top notch!
For those who know these great creative masterpieces and for those who don't, I HEARTILY RECOMMEND this compendium of PURE AWESOMNESS!",1389139200,,740,5.024390243902439

I suppose those were market driven choices made by the studio back in 1956 but it compromised the original power of the original Broadway production. Image and sound as presented in the streaming online version is OK, not great, considering the original film was shot in a large film format (Cinemascope55) with 6 tracks of audio. If this were available on BluRay with better image quality and better surround sound, I would purchase even with all the flaws in this production, but it isn't.

But why oh why were two songs deleted? Infuriating. Two songs are missing from ""The King and I,"" important songs"" and it bothers me because I remember them from the first run of those two movies.

361228,4,6301759079,"Originally a play called ""Liliom"" by the Hungarian playwright and novelist Ferenc Molnar, this was the second collaboration by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, a successor to their show Oklahoma. The Broadway show dates from 1945 and the film from 1956. It tells the story of the romance between a cotton mill worker (Shirley Jones) and a carousel barker (Gordon Macrae) who works at a fairground. It was filmed in CinemaScope and Eastmancolor and contains another crop of fresh tunes, some of which have become ""evergreens"": `You'll never walk alone', `If I loved you', `June is bustin' out all over', and the Carousel waltz that opens the show. Waltzes were a speciality amongst Rodgers' many compositions with both Hart and Hammerstein. The film is a little wistful in that our hero, Billy Bigelow, the barker, dies in an attempted robbery, but he is allowed back to earth for a while to see how his daughter has grown up, which also gives him a chance to repent for his sins. The original story is not one that lends itself to adaptation as a happy-go-lucky musical and other reviewers are right to question the whole morality of the piece. However, I'm sure the storyline made for good dramatic theatre. The music is sumptuously orchestrated and played by the studio orchestra conducted by Alfred Newman, who has very many film scores to his credit. Thoroughly recommended.",1345075200,,1384,4.944206008583691

361283,5,6301759079,"When was the last time you had a dance? Carousel is a musical's musical. It is the product of a time period in film making history that produced great, extraordinaire, & epic musicals that could never be topped. The music and the story were written by the dynamic duo known as Rodgers and Hammerstein. Carousel is essentially about a carney barker criminal type named Billy Bigelow. He is employed as a hype man for a carnival carousel.  This doesn't necessary sound like the backdrop for the greatest story ever told, but with the proper direction Henry King was able to turn this number into a classic of the big band song & dance variety.  The story is basically about Billy Bigelow falling in love, dying young, and returning to make things right. The story is great but the real attraction here is the song, dance, choreography, costumes, big greased up haircuts, and sideburns. Its all out of sight. If you do like musicals about life its a given that you probably love this film. If you don't like musicals I suggest you watch this movie and give it your full attention. You might make a great discovery. It will enlighten you. Essentially you might want to stand up and sing a song as loud as you can.

361342,3,6301759079,"Carousel seems to have been one of the least successful of the great 1950s film musicals.  When I saw it for the first time recently, although I had no preconceived judgments about it, my response to it was not very positive.  Even though it contains some fine and famous songs, such as ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and ""If I Loved You,"" I felt only minimal enthusiasm for it as a musical and I found the dance sequences very  forgettable except for Louise's ""carousel dance.""

As some other Amazon reviewers have pointed out, the story is on ""the dark side"" for a musical.  My thought was that at the end, even though Billy's spirit was given a chance to come down to earth from Heaven  in order to make up for some lack-love mistakes in his life, and although I was moved by the love he expressed in his ""spiritual form,"" I never felt he was a very sympathetic character.  For me, he most approached being lovable when he was singing the song in which he looked forward to interacting with his unborn child, ""Billy,"" whom he imagined would be a copy of himself whom he would love.  I never felt that he ever really loved the girl he got involved with, even though he married her.

Although I wasn't particularly turned off by the character played by Shirley Jones, I just felt a disappointment in her character too--maybe a lack of depth there.  Since the themes in the story were serious and tragic, I think that the female lead should have been just a hint deeper as a character and less saccharine in appearance.

At the end of the film, my thought was ""This is a very odd musical.""

Perhaps other viewers react differently to Billy.  Certainly, there are many rave notices from viewers who found Carousel to be a great, satisfying experience.  I don't wish I'd never seen it.  I AM GLAD THAT I SAW this film of the musical, mainly because it caused me to ponder about why I did not find it successful.

(I had the same reaction after viewing Brigadoon.  Before I saw it, I had really liked the idea of a village that could disappear and reappear in ""time,"" and I thought I'd really enjoy Brigadoon.  Except for liking very much the ever-genius dancing of Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse in it, I still simply can't figure out why Brigadoon just did not come across well on the whole either!)",1320019200,,2290,4.47710843373494
361343,5,6301759079,"I purchased this boxed set for my mother, age 91.  She loves these movies, particularly ""the Sound of Music""....
For me, they're OK,I'm not a big traditional movie fan.  I saw most of them as a child in the theatre, and especially remember enjoying ""the Sound of Music"" and (to me the far superior ""The King and I""....which was the first movie at which  I cried at the ending!)

I must add I bought the boxed set used. I've never had a problem with buying used CD's or DVD's via Amazon third party sellers.  The boxed set was shrink-wrapped, and every DVD is in perfect condition. And FAR less expensive!

Someone had an issue with the ""letter box"" format of the ""The King and I"".  If you think about it, that is the way you see movies in a theatre: rectangular shape.  When they ""reformat for your TV"" as they say, you get a square shape that leaves out part of the original picture to fit the traditional TV shape.

The sound quality is good, of course that depends more on your home speakers but even with my mother's tube TV, older model, the singing and the music sound great.  She is VERY happy with the set, and replays them often, especially....""The Sound of Music""!!",1315440000,,1175,4.423255813953489

One, can the producers please figure away to do away with, or at least minimize the effects of the colored lenses used in ""South Pacific?""

I usually buy movies used on VHS or DVD save much money buying used. If Its a black & white or a cartoon then I will buy It on VHS If Its a very good movie I will buy It on DVD but If Its a classic I buy It on Blu-Ray but I think Blu-Ray Is over priced after all when People bought DVD They though They were buying the best Not knowing They were being lied to by these corporations trying to sell them a new copy that has been compressed or should I say stripped. In the 1970's & 80' & 90's a large screen CRT was 25 Inch and People did Not complain about the picture quality If They got a good reception & the vertical hold was Not off but People want a television with good color and the old CRT which People I read on web still wish made which has a brighter clearer more colorful picture than these newer plasma and LCD televisions and now they are trying to get Us for more money coming out with LED television. People have asked Is It worth buying Blu-Ray If have standard television? Absolutely, I just said movies on DVD were compressed or should I say stripped so You will notice a difference. I have watched this movie on both standard CRT television and My Computer LCD wide screen monitor, the standard CRT looks better but It cuts some of the picture off but the wide screen more of the picture Is visible and I Am Not just saying that, this Is a true wide screen movie shot on 70 mm film Not a compressed or chopped off picture to look like wide screen.",1289347200,,1871,4.1287671232876715

361475,3,6301759079,"I confess that I was never fond of Rodgers & Hammerstein's film versions. I purchased the Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection only for the music, because I saw the films when they were released, and though I was a real fan of musicals (the Kelly and Donen and Minnelli ones) I hated CAROUSEL, THE KING AND I and SOUTH PACIFIC. Later I saw OKLAHOMA (not in Todd-AO, because in my country Uruguay was released only in the CinemaScope print) with several songs deleted, and I was not very fond of it either. And I never wanted to see THE SOUND OF MUSIC, probably because I had seen DIE TRAPP FAMILY already, an awful german film (corny, schmalzy and sugary), and I thought the Robert Wise version would made me the same impression, which I confirmed later, when I saw it with my kids. So, why should I buy THE RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN COLLECTION? Well, in the first place because I'm buying all the musicals that I can get, and second, because the films were remastered, with the two versions of STATE FAIR (the first one good, the remake awful), the rare Fritz Lang's french version of LILIOM and the opportunity to find out, once and for all, why THE SOUND OF MUSIC is the most loved family film of all times. And I must recognize that I couldn't find the reason. The film is better than I remembered, and Julie Andrews certainly steals the show, but that's all. I can stand OKLAHOMA (except for the unbearable Gloria Grahame) because the music is glorious. And the same goes for SOUTH PACIFIC (with an impossible Rossano Brazzi, dubbed and a lousy actor), but THE KING AND I is simply unpleasant. Deborah Kerr (dubbed in the songs by Marni Nixon) is a good actress, but why she tries all the time to be adorable when she is simply mellifluous and corny? And Yul Brynner (who stole the Oscar in 1956 from Laurence Olivier in RICHARD III, Rock Hudson and James Dean in GIANT and Kirk Douglas in LUST FOR LIFE) is always overacting, ignoring that a cinematic performance shouldn't be a stage recreation. I can't stand him. I never could. So, the films are all watchable (the prints are really good), the extras are always interesting and the music is, most of the times, worth listening. The films (all of them) are second rate, dated, overlong, boring and the best way to demonstrate WHICH IS THE WORST WAY TO ADAPT A STAGE PLAY TO THE SCREEN. Gene Kelly, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Charles Walters, George Sidney and George Cukor, among others, knew it.

361478,4,6301759079,"This review contains a few spoilers.  I'm also reviewing this from the perspective of the decade in which it was released, so you may find me a bit paranoid.

The things that I most enjoy about films from this era is their virtually-ironclad understanding of ethics and fear of God.  It's for this reason that initially, I was turned off by Carousel.  There were times, in fact, midway through the film, where I felt that it was genuinely trying to lose me, and working hard to ditch both the ethical and theological beliefs of its audience, but after having thought about it for a while, however, I'm no longer convinced of that.

Carousel is a Rodgers & Hammerstein production, and like all of their classic productions, it's rich with music and dance, and the singing is excellent.  They clearly had to go to a lot of trouble to find talent for films like this, and I appreciate the work they did.  Before computers started taking the place of actors, this was how it was always done, though certainly they did it better than most.  The sets are nice, the costumes appropriately-tasteful for the most part, though not extravagant, and the performances of dancing and singing were impressively-done.

In this film, a carousel barker named Billy Bigelow falls for a young girl named Julie, and they later elope together.  Billy, however, has never been able to control his temper, and is more than a little arrogant and self-righteous to boot, to say nothing of being rash, impulsive and having an easy time justifying acts of wickedness, if he thinks he can get something out of it, and he's the main character of the drama.

Eventually, it turns out that Julie is pregnant, and Billy commits to assisting a delinquent friend of his (even worse than him) in robbing a rich man in order to help support his own family.  However, the robbery doesn't go off as planned, and Billy dies in the process.  He ends up in a place that certainly isn't Heaven, but doesn't quite seem to be Hell either, and there, he's given one day to go back to Earth and change things for the betterment of his wife and daughter, who is now fifteen.

Billy is depicted as a reprobate at every turn.  For a while, I figured this film would pull out of that trend, much like Groundhog Day or Liar Liar.  However, much to my surprise, the character retains his rash, foolish, arrogant demeanor up to the very end, regardless of any positive character traits that he might also have.

At first, that confused me, because many of the other characters seemed so accomodating to his behavior, even to the point of treating his abuse like it was something other that what it was; a lack of real consideration for other people's feelings.  I just couldn't make heads or tails of what they were trying to say.

I was ready to pronounce firm judgement on this film based on that alone, when it occurred to me to look at it in a different way, and suddenly, I found that the film, while still imperfect, wasn't trying to tear ethics to shreds anymore.  If I were to rate this film, though, I would label it PG-13, because moral people will dislike it unless they look at it in one specific way.  Just the fact that I have to think about it this way, though, is probably a point for it, rather than against it.

This movie is essentially the story of an anti-hero struggling for redemption, while still burdened by all his own faults.  In some ways, this story is tragic, and the character of Billy Bigelow is tragic as well, because his own behavior and pride are what keep him from this redemption, but he is at least able to change enough that the people closest to him don't suffer too much from his presence in their lives.

In that respect, it's a bit like trying to filter ""It's a Wonderful Life"" through ""The Picture of Dorian Gray.""  They go out of their way to imply that Billy is definitely as much of a jerk as he seems to be; that he really is guilty of everything the other characters accuse him of, and that he has absolutely no regrets about it, aside from the way things turned out.  However, he does still seem to have this desire to not hurt the people in his life, even though it doesn't motivate any of his real actions until the very end of the picture.

The other characters, however, give him much more leeway than he deserves, and he, predictably, abuses their trust.  Again and again, he makes a mess of his life, and it's only by great care and subtlety that he manages to avoid destroying his wife and daughter too.

This, I'm convinced, was the real point of the movie; the fact that our actions do have consequences for the people in our lives, for good or ill.  By dwelling on this wicked man, and how he ruined his own life, we can be led to question our own actions; are we truly doing the right thing, or are we leading ourselves down a path of despair and emptiness by thinking too much of our own desires, when others depend on us?

Watching the film with this mentality dispels all my issues with it except two, and these two are the reason why I gave it one star down.  The first is that half the musical numbers felt surreal and abstract, as if they didn't really belong where they were put, and didn't have much to do with the plot of the movie as a whole, but this is just a design choice when you get down to it, and it's not movie-wrecking on its own.

The second point is Louise on the beach in her invisible stockings and shoes.  Near the end of the film, one of the characters says that Louise is on the beach in stockings and shoes, just like Billy used to be, but when we see her, she's completely barefoot, and not only that, but she does several dance moves which reveal virtually her whole legs under her dress, just before a selection of oddly-dressed circus performers dance out and imitate a carousel.  Not only is this completely out of nowhere, but if this were a more recent film, I'd almost accuse it of doing this whole sequence for shock value.  Heck, if it were a more recent film, it WOULD have been done for shock value, and it would have been a lot more shocking and revealing, so I'm glad it wasn't a more recent film.  I hope no one ever re-makes this movie, based on this alone.  What's going on on the screen may seem tame to us, but in the fifties, this was what it meant to push the bar, and I'm not really in favor of doing that.

On the whole, though, this is not an unenjoyable movie.  Just don't show it to kids, because the mixed messages are so thick, you could cut them with a broadaxe.  I said earlier that I'd rate this PG-13, and I stand by that.  If you show this to your kids, be prepared to do a lot of parental guiding.",1277596800,,6667,4.386991869918699

361541,5,6301759079,"I count ""Carousel"" as one of the three best American theater musicals ever--along with ""Porgy & Bess"" and ""West Side Story."" R & H had so many good musicals, but this one may have the best music and the best story. This 50th anniversary edition (no blu-ray?)has two CDs of high quality video and lots of extras, highlighted by the commentary of Shirley Jones and a duet of ""If I Loved You"" by the original Broadway leads, Jan Clayton and John Raitt from a 1954 TV show.

I sang in a group which included Jan Clayton's understudy years ago, and was a member of the chorus in a local production of the show. Clayton displays a slightly darker soprano than Shirley Jones and a pixie quality not unlike Mary Martin, who introduced the duet in the TV show. Raitt is a somewhat stronger high baritone than Gordon MacRae, but both in my view served the role well vocally.

I won't get into the plot and performances which are covered extensively in other reviews, but did want to comment on Shirley Jones' commentary--especially regarding Frank Sinatra, who was supposed to play Billy--prerecorded the songs, but dropped out of the movie, it was said, because he didn't want to do an extra take for the cinemascope cameras. Shirley doesn't shed any light on this, and Frank told her he didn't want to discuss it.

Sinatra was at the peak of his powers as a singer in the mid-50s. I've heard tapes of some of his ""Carousel"" 1955 pre-recordings, and he sings very well, though he lacks the strong highs MacRae brought from his vocal training. Sinatra, however, had more depth as an actor, and would have made the dark ""tough"" side of Billy more vivid. Shirley Jones, on the other hand, had great chemistry with MacRae, evident previously in ""Oklahoma"", and you wonder why he hadn't been the first choice.

Contrary to what Shirley says, Frank did pre-record Soliloquy in 3 takes, subsequently recorded it again for release in 1963 and, remarkably, sang it in concert in his 70s which was released in 1995. In the latter he used the original ""barroom"" lyrics from the initial Broadway production cut from the movie. He also used these lyrics in his original Columbia recording in 1946. Sinatra had great savvy with a lyric, and he obviously relishes ""Soliloquy"", expecially the concert version in his 70s, which I think, incredibly, is his best effort. He sings it like a guy who has been there, done that--with a great deal of  conviction. Perhaps he regretted not playing the role.

One wonders what kind of a movie ""Carousel"" would have been with Sinatra as Billy. And Vincente Minnelli as Director instead of Henry King. What would Minnelli have done with the sets? Safe to say it would have been different--on both counts.",1268870400,2,2717,4.7094736842105265

Minor quibbles:

1. The junk before the required musical starts is irritating, e.g. several copyright warnings on every disk plus a repetitive promo for Sound of Music, which is in the set anyway.

2.  The gossipy commentaries are excellent, most informative and amusing, but the sound track behind them is almost inaudible at times.  This wouldn't matter so much except when a particular bit of soundtrack is being referenced and one can't hear what they are talking about.  Of course one can listen out for it when playing the movie through later, but it irritating nevertheless.

361579,3,6301759079,"Allegedly innovative for it's time, 'Carousel' has tragic elements and an overture to herald the musical*. For those who insist on old-fashioned entertainment it is sure to please. However, a tritely written script doesn't help the proceedings no matter how much it may dwell upon love. Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs and score greatly improve the journey after a consequentially slow start. The results are mixed, but the best songs, particularly ""June Is Bustin' out All Over"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" give some badly needed zest even though the screenplay repeats itself or ineffectively borrows from elements of 'Our Town' and 'It's a Wonderful Life'. A comparison to Oscar and Hammerstein's best musicals, including 'Oklahoma' and 'The Sound of Music' will reveal this musical to be an inconsistent carnival ride to be sure.

He also played the Padre in the original Broadway production of ""Man of La Mancha."" His solo ballad, ""To Each His Dulcinea,"" is one of the highlights of the show.

Bob, as he liked his friends to call him (I was both his friend and singing student), was good friends with ""Gordy"" MacRae. The two of them were classmates at Deerfield Academy. Both of them, therefore, were New Englanders who felt right at home in the world of ""Carousel.""

But I do wish that the first version of State Fair, from 1933, had been included.  It's currently unavailable on DVD, and really deserves to be more widely known.  While it's not an R&H musical -- which I guess gave the '62 Pat Boone musical re-make an edge for inclusion here -- it's probably the most accurate screen production of the best-selling novel by Phil Stong.  With Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, and Lew Ayres as the stars, and a very low-key, gentle sense of humor that brings out the warmth of the story, I'm sure that many would see it as the real inspiration for the excellent R&H musical film from a dozen years later.  Heck, the 1933 film even includes extensive background shots of the actual Iowa State Fair, although I don't think the stars were photographed on location.  (Frankly, I could live without the Pat Boone version, which unaccountably transfers the state fair from its Iowa origin to Texas, although I do like Tom Ewell and Alice Faye very much.)

The 12 box set had gone from the US to Australia, then with my grand-nieces from australia's gold coast via Kuala Lumpur to Bandung Java........certainly a long way and a long time in getting here.
We all sat and enjoyed Oklahoma...yes I agree with other reviewers the transfer from the 35 mm cinemascope version is superior to that taken from the Todd AO print. We then sat through the Sound of music....and after a week my grand-nieces returned....and I've been enjoying selected songs from the King and I, and South Pacific. Sound and picture's are ""superb"". The many times I'd gone along to the movies even seeing original 70 mm versions on screen in Australia....the DVD's absolutely ""sparkle"". I had several ""letter-box"" R and H musicals and despite the 5:1 sound, this latest compilation even in NTSC looks great on our LCD Samsung.
Unless you move really close to the screen it is hard to determine if the pictures are standard definition. Computer restoration has meant that there's not a hint that the original medium was film.
""Happy Talk"" (and her we only have seen some of the songs of South Pacific's road show version) to me is better than ever......computer restorers have excelled themselves in revealing more ""shadow"" details than the 70 mm print contained.
I could go on and on.....however anyone who has this latest R and H collection will not be sorry.....this is a true collector's item not only for us oldies, but for a whole new generation to enjoy!

361818,5,6301759079,"This review refers to the '50th Anniversary Edition' of the Rodgers & Hammerstein masterpiece ""Carousel"", filmed in 1956. Whatever problems that may have existed in previous releases of this great musical have been apparently resolved in this latest (2006) edition. Amazon.com mixes all of the reviews that pertain to different editions (of the same film), so it can be confusing. There are other reviews of ""Carousel"" from previous editions that are mixed in with the 50th Anniversary Edition reviews--and they complain about the DVD--look at the date of the review--they are referring to a previous release!

The digital restoration of the 50th Anniversary Edition is simply superb! The images literally jump off of the screen. Presented in widescreen, the picture has been enhanced for large screen TVs--so goodbye to that annoying little letterbox image. I watched this movie on a 46-inch Samsung LCD high definition TV, played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player--and the picture and sound are simply stunning! If you had any doubts about purchasing a copy of this in the past--this issue is definitely worth it.

361820,5,6301759079,"This version of ""Carousel"" received critical acclaim but failed at the box office when it was first released in 1956.  After watching it again on this wonderful DVD I understand the mixed reactions.  This is a beautiful story, beautifully told with beautiful music but it is dark.  Boy is it ever dark!  American movie audiences weren't ready for this sort of thing in the `50s but that was their loss.

Despite the movie's Bowdlerization of the story --  Billy Bigelow dies accidentally rather than by his own hand, as the original Broadway show had it - it's still wonderful.  It's easy to forget what great voices both Shirley Jones (Julie Jordan) and Gordon McRae (Billy Bigelow) had.  McRae's rendering of Soliloquy was both beautiful and deeply movie, and Jones' combination of youth, beauty, and singing talent couldn't have been more appealing.

Equally appealing is the ballet, featuring Susan Luckey as young Louise Bigelow and Jacques D'Amboise as her carnival dancing partner.  The choreography was based on the great Agnes De Mille's choreography for the original Broadway procuction.

The film's original 2.55:1 formatting and multi-channel soundtrack have been retained.  The whole thing looks and sounds pristine.

I recently viewed it again on this DVD with my new lady, a widow.  She saw so many similarities showing herself as the young and innocent Julie and her experiences with her deceased husband who clearly resembled Billy in many ways.  It was a cathartic experience for her to see this film.  As for me, it was a reminder of what I was also seeking back then, someone to love too.  It is amazing how artfully Rogers and Hammerstein created a real life metaphysical story from such simple and touching moments.  The costumes, scenery and music and words are just beautiful.

361825,3,6301759079,"When I first saw this movie, some 50 years ago, I was much taken by it.  It had something to do with Shirley Jones, I will admit.  She was so innocent, so vulnerable looking, so beautiful, so talented.  After seeing this again, it is still Shirley Jones who makes this worthwhile.  But there are nagging difficulties that I can't get past.

Some of the songs and dance numbers are simply wonderful--""June is Bustin' Out All Over,"" ""If I Loved You,"" for examples.  Then there are some long and seemingly pointless bits, such as the interminable dance on the beach by Billy's daughter et al.

But the most distressing element is the closing ""message,"" that a woman hit by a man who loves her doesn't feel the hurt.  It goes with the song with the line ""He's your fella' and you love him, and that's all there is to that.""  Well, nonsense.  That isn't something I'd want to teach my daughter, not something my wife or any other rational woman would stand for today.  ""Stand By Your Man"" may be the mantra of some in the trailer parks, but it's wrong.  I can't help but cringe, even though I know that in the ethos of the 1950s few moviegoers complained.  After all, Ricky turned Luci over his knee and spanked her when she spent too much money, and people watching on TV were amused by it.  Lynching blacks was also approved by many people at one time.

That moral takes away a great deal from the movie.  I would have been better off to have remembered this as it was in my callow youth when I didn't know any better.",1203984000,5,1515,4.376344086021505

361886,4,6301759079,"I have seen quite a few musicals and I think I liked nearly all them, including ""The Music Man,"" ""Oklahoma,"" ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"" ""West Side Story,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and many more.  I was unprepared for ""Carousel.""  The themes in this movie are dark and the protagonist is not particularly sympathetic.  Much of the music is deeper and the tunes are less catchy than those in other musicals.  In spite of these differences, this musical does have its moments and has an ending worth waiting for.

Billy Bigelow (Gordon MacRae, ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"" and ""Oklahoma"") is the barker at a carousel on the coast of Maine.  Billy is smooth-talking and has a way with women.  When Billy meets beautiful Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones in one of her earliest roles), a woman changes him for the first time in his life.

Billy fails to get into the spirit of being married.  Indeed, he hits Julie in a scene that positively made me cringe.  Billy seems to be on the verge of going back to being a single carousel barker.  I think I would have been happier for Julie as opposed to having her married an abuser, but Julie tells him that he is going to be a father.  Billy realizes that he has to get serious about his responsibilities as a father and a husband.  Unfortunately, he allows a ""friend"" to talk him into taking part in a robbery that goes awry, and Julie and future daughter Louise no longer have a husband and father.

We meet Billy at the beginning of the movie in heaven, having yet to learn of Billy's past.  Billy seems introspective and less than happy with being in heaven.  Billy learns that there is trouble on earth with his daughter.  Billy talks with his boss in heaven and describes the events in his life leading up to how he came to heaven, thus enabling us to learn why Billy is unhappy.  Because there may be some people who have yet to see this movie, I am going to stop describing the plot at this point.

The painful part of this movie is dreading what will happen to Billy.  We know he is in heaven, but we sense that he has not yet found redemption for his behavior on earth.  Somehow it seems that he needs to return to earth to redeem not only himself, but us for our patience in waiting for the end of the movie.  Indeed, some of our dread may be that our waiting will be in vain.  Never fear, the end of the movie is satisfying and you will be glad you waited.

Enjoy!",1195084800,3,2420,4.338530066815145

361944,5,6301759079,"CAROUSEL is one of the best of the many Broadway musicals made in to movies that came out in the 1950's and 1960's.  Alas it is not one of the most successful or widely seen possibly because it opens with its weakest scene - Billy in some after life ""polishing the stars"".  I almost gave up on the movie after seeing that both surreal and corny set despite having seen and loved the stage production but thankfully the rest of the movie is much much better.  Though it has dark themes the movie is quite beautiful to look it with much of it filmed on location at the Maine coast with many colorful costumes and of course the songs are both memorable and well performed.  Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae are perfect as Julie and Billy a couple who should have never gotten together romantically but tragically somehow did.  Some have felt that the movie condones spousal abuse because Julie excuses Billy's violence toward her but I saw his hitting as just another example of his many character flaws and her acceptance a part of her dangerously sweet nature and the audience should be smart enough to connect the dots that this is a BAD way to behave.  The other characters in the play are shocked by it and I believe we are supposed to be also.  The movie is quite long and though well executed the long dance scenes don't play as well on film as they do in live theater and could have used some pruning.  There is some comic relief from the well played Carrie and Enoch Snow and their eventual nine children and practical Cousin Nettie and slimy Jigger also add interest.  The closing scene where Billy's spirit somehow forces Louise's spirit to listen to the wise words in the graduation speech is very moving.  Wise words for us all to live by in that no one can change what their parents might be or have been and that instead of worrying about whether people like us we would do better worrying about liking people.",1184889600,2,1921,4.478510028653295

362061,5,6301759079,"This movie is full of joy and love and pain.  It is the story of the life of a man who is a Carousel barker - a good one, too, but who doesn't know who to earn money any other way.  He meets a sweet and independent, beautiful young woman, who works at a mill.  They soon find themselves out of work, married and with a baby coming.

And it's about second chances.  The Carousel barker gets a second chance to set things right after he dies trying to find a way to get money to support his family.

The movie is the origin of one of my favorite songs of all times - You'll Never Walk alone.  ""When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, and don't be afraid of the dark. At the end of the storm is a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a lark....""",1178928000,,760,3.896103896103896

In the case of these films, it is certainly worth the cost of replacing them.

There are too many wonderful features to describe here, however, if you're a musical fan, you WON'T be disappointed. The picture quality is about the best you'll see on films of this vintage.",1178236800,2,539,5.172413793103448

State Fair was never a favorite but they included the 1962 version as well -- now I really LIKE the original -- and they call that an Extra?  Same for Carousel - they include the 1934 Liliom.  You may think you're only getting six movies but it's far much more than that.  I won't go into the sing-along format, but the kitchen sink is included as well.

For me a little R & H goes a long way - this is just perfect for those days when I need a shot of beautiful music, basic morals, great sets and yes, I'll admit watching Anna and the King dance the polka makes me cry for joy.",1177804800,32,715,4.115107913669065
362127,5,6301759079,"Sister musical to ""Oklahoma"" with identical leads singing and emoting like nobody's business. Set against the Maine coast during spring and summer months, this musical razzles and dazzles with exciting tunes and dance numbers, although the plot in itself is based on tragedy.
Only Rodgers & Hammerstein could have pulled this off for the big movie screen as it is filmed in almost cinematic scope with wide dimensions and excellent scenery locations.
This story really blongs to Billy Bigelow with his struggling wife next to him all the way trying to overcome his failures on planet earth, and it is told from his recollection in heaven. The songs are soft, endearing, and at times quite bouncy, but it is a tragic story made beautiful by the filmakers, production crew, and wonderful actors.

It would have been nice to have one more to share with them, making it 3 family classics and 3 adult classics. Apart from that brief disappointment, my wife and I are happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the old time classics.

This is the second time since Christmas that this has happened when purchasing a DVD thru Amazon.... After ordering the Star Wars 6-pack, Star Wars II was not watchable.

362134,1,6301759079,"This movie was a big disappointment.  The love story between the two is not developed and you wonder why she would ever want to marry such a man in the first place.  You never see any redeeming qualities, not even when he is in heaven.  They have a musical number with a corpse right there next to them.  Never during the movie does she ever feel anger towards her completely amoral husband.  She loves him unconditionally and the movie even sugar coats the wife-beating.  Her daughter asks her at the end of the movie, ""if anyone could ever hit you really hard and it feels like a kiss"" and Shirley Jones says emphatically, remembering her fond days of abuse, Yes!

362186,4,6301759079,The newly-remastered pkg of 5 R&H musicals is worth the asking price for two reasons. 1) The remastering results in better picture and and sound than found in previously offered versions. 2) among the bonus features is the re-make of STATE FAIR starring Pat Boone and Alice Faye.,1171756800,9,279,4.833333333333333
362187,5,6301759079,"If you are a fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, you must own the new 50th anniversary DVD of CAROUSEL (1956), starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones.  The restored color, 2.55 ratio wide-screen for CinemaScope 55, and remastered sound are awesome.  This is like opening night in 1956 New York.

CAROUSEL is based on Molnar's Hungarian play LILIOM, which was filmed by Fritz Lang in 1934 France with a superb Charles Boyer.  A complete studio print of Lang's LILIOM is just one of many bonuses on disk two.  Rodgers and Hammerstein added some of their most memorable songs (""You'll Never Walk Alone,:"" ""If I Loved You,"" ""June is Bustin' Out All Over""), built up the role of Julie to make her a strong and likeable heroine, and gave the whole show a Heaven framework.  (LILIOM has Julie in a supporting role, no songs, and Heaven only shown in the last reel.)  Billy Bigelow is a carnival barker in a New England seaport (location filming was done in Maine) who loses his job, marries shy and lovely Julie, gets her pregnant, then dies during an evocative clambake.  (I won't give away more details here).  The play and film are in flashback from up in Heaven, so I haven't really given away too much plot.

Ample disk one bonuses, besides the restored movie, include an audio commentary with Shirley Jones, isolated music score, songs only option, and Karaoke sing-along.  Besides all of the 1934 LILIOM, disk two has a TV kinescope excerpt of John Raitt and Jan Clayton (from Broadway) doing ""If I Loved You; a filmmaking featurette; musical outtakes from the movie; Fox Movietone newsreels of Darryl Zanuck crowing about the glories of  the short-lived CinemaScope 55, and the New York film premiere; and an ample stills gallery.

You really get your money's worth if you love musicals and invest in this brand-new DVD of CAROUSEL.",1171065600,12,1840,4.803174603174603

362258,5,6301759079,"This is one of the finest DVD collections ever produced. Fox has added the same three anniversary editions from last year--""Oklahoma,"" ""State Fair,"" and ""The Sound Of Music""--to a thin-pack set with this year's bonanzas:  ""Carousel,"" ""The King And I,"" and for good measure, although it's not an anniversary, ""South Pacific.""  Extras abound here with such delight that it should take the dedicated viewer many nights to fully appreciate all the contents. For example, the 1934 ""Liliom,"" the French film based on Ferenc Molnar's play, that establishes the story of ""Carousel"" as a drama, is a special gift from Fox.  The 55mm and Todd- AO versions of several films are now fully available and the Road Show version of ""South Pacific"" is presented.  Richard Barrios, one of our major experts in film musicals provides the commentary (with others) for ""State Fair,"" ""The King And I,"" and ""South Pacific.""  There are excerpts from TV and Broadway versions of songs and numerous other bonuses that are exhilarating.

 Remember, too, that ""South Pacific"" had what was in 1958 considered by many in the industry to be the finest example of sound design and engineering to that time, and it won the Oscar for Best Sound.

The compact set, which is apparently the new industry standard, also features a short but very useful booklet. If you love Richard Rodgers and his second partner, Oscar Hammerstein II, this box set should be number one on your list right now.",1164412800,139,1455,4.934426229508197

All 6 have now been fully remastered to meet the demands of the latest TV and computer equipment. They have always been great, but they've truly never looked and sounded better than they do now.

But wait--there's more! This package includes a generous bunch of extras: documentaries, deleted material, alternate versions, interviews, running commentaries, soundtrack albums, performances by stars from the original stage productions, even a remake of STATE FAIR from 1962. The extras alone are a good reason to upgrade your copies--or to get them for the first time.

If you're looking for colorful, romantic stories with brilliant performances and a virtual catalogue of nearly 100 of the very best show tunes in history, you couldn't make a better purchase. These are, quite simply, the finest films of their kind. No serious DVD collection is complete without them. Watch. Listen. Enjoy!

362261,5,6301759079,"Rodgers & Hammerstein's groundbreaking musical version of Molnar's ""Liliom"" has been given a fine rendering on film. Gordon Macrae is the carousel barker, Billy Bigelow, who falls in love with the lovely millworker, Julie Jordan, portrayed by the talented Shirley Jones. The road to happiness is paved with wife abuse, criminal acts, and tragedy, not the usual items found in musicals.

The score of ""Carousel"" is probably one the greatest ever composed for the musical theatre. ""If I Loved You"" is sung by the couple in a lovers' lane setting where their attitudes and emotions are conveyed by Rodgers' bittersweet melody and Hammerstein's wonderful lyrics. ""June is Bustin' Out All Over"" is danced and sung by the ensemble of youthful denizens of the Maine town where the story is set. The choreography is delightful, somewhat reminiscent of the athletic-balletic dancing in ""7 Brides for 7 Brothers"". Gordon Macrae's moving performance of ""Soliloquy"" along the rocky seashore with its crashing waves is nothing short of perfection. Frank Sinatra was originally to have the role, but to be frank, he looked a little silly in the costume worn by the character as seen in a still photograph shown in a documentary about Rodgers and Hammerstein.

The cinematography is spectacular using the Cinemascope 55 process. Of course, the film must be seen in its widescreen version available on DVD and soon to be re-released on DVD in a 2 disc 50th Anniversary edition. I first saw ""Carousel"" at the Roxy Theatre when it opened in 1956. The huge screen seemed like a window looking out on the world of these star-crossed characters. The sound was stereophonic and still is in its video incarnations.

Supporting performances are also fine. Cameron Mitchell is Billy's bad influence. Barbara Ruick and Robert Rounsville have magnificent voices and sing the lovely ""When the Children Are Asleep"" against the panoramic scenery of a June sailboat ride to a clambake. At the clambake, the chorus lead by Claramae Turner sings the heart out of ""A Real Nice Clambake"". Turner also sings the anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" at a tragic turning point in the film.

The best way to see ""Carousel"" is in a theatre, but see it. It is sometimes shown on the Fox Movie Channel in its original widescreen version. Lean back and enjoy.",1160611200,6,2312,4.981865284974093
362262,5,6301759079,"This brand-new 50th Anniversary edition of CAROUSEL is definitely a must for all fans of the uplifting and inspiring Rodgers and Hammerstein classic.  Considered by Rodgers as the personal favourite of all his works, and based on the play ""Liliom"" by Ferenc Molnar; the story concerns innocent factory-girl Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones) and jaded carnival barker Billy Bigelow (Gordon MacRae).  Despite coming from the opposite sides of the track, the two fall in love, but their relationship is tempered by Billy's violent outbursts and inability to find an honest job.  When Julie becomes pregnant, he is talked into committing a robbery, but the plan backfires when he falls on his own knife and dies while trying to escape the police.  Now in Heaven, Billy is given one last chance to redeem himself and to reconcile his now-teenaged daughter.  Filled with haunting songs like ""If I Loved You"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", CAROUSEL remains a very moving film experience.

This DVD has been available for a while in the UK and Australia, and will finally get a US release this November.  Extra features will include audio commentary from Shirley Jones and Nick Redman; an all-new featurette ""Turns on the Carousel"", vintage performances from the ""General Foods"" Rodgers & Hammerstein TV tribute (original Broadway leads John Raitt and Jan Clayton performing the complete Bench Scene/""If I Loved You"").

362263,5,6301759079,"this is one of the best Broadway musicals on film. The entire cast and crew delivers and it`s no wonder why 20th Century-Fox took over MGM`s undisputed reign as a musical master. No one could do musicals like MGM, but by mid-50s the studio set musicals were coming of age and other studios jumped to the occasion with musicals such as The Sound of Music, this film, Hello Dolly, South Pacific and Song Of Norway.

No I ain`t saying that was for the better - but in the case of The Sound of Music and Carousel - it worked... With Lost Horizon??? I better be quiet....",1148428800,2,566,4.339622641509434
362264,4,6301759079,"Fans of the movie ""Carousel"" be prepared, at last the two disc anniversary edition is on its way. It was released three weeks ago in Australia and must surely be available at Amazon within the next few weeks. It has been released with two disc special editions here of ""the King and I"" and ""South Pacific""(the best of the set) and of course ""Oklahoma"" and ""State Fair"" which have been available in the States for some time. Why three of these musicals were kept from release in the States is one of the mysteries of the age. Regardless ""Carousel"" is finally in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and unlike the current print available is a beautifully remastered, clear as bell color print finally restoring this movie to its long overdue glory. Two discs have several features (not as many as the other R&H movies)some nice tidy specials and sequences from the 1954 Ford Anniversary special with the Original Broadway cast doing the entire 14 minute bench scene. The big disappointment is the audio commentary, for even though it has Shirley Jones and Nick Redman chatting away merrily (as in ""Oklahoma"") their knowledge of the movie is scant to say the least. They have to struggle to remember Robert Rounseville and Gene Lockhart's names(did not anyone supply them with a cast list) and even though there are some interesting vignettes along the way (such as how Barbara Ruick died so young and was married to John Williams the movie composer),they need some more info on the script of the musical itself. For instance, Shirley has played in the movie and when recording the commentary was playing Cousin Nettie on stage, yet no one seemed to ever tell her that Billy Bigelow always committed suicide in the stage versions and his falling on his knife was a cop out for the movie version to soften the darkness of the script and his intent. She says she loved the Lincoln Centre production, but clearly missed the lines about suicide and makes an idiotic comment about the falling on the knife being an idea they copied from ""Oklahoma"" (only the screenwriters, Shirley).This takes away from an otherwise delightful release, hopefully you will get it in the States soon.",1147219200,11,2164,4.81989247311828

362337,5,6301759079,"A great musical, though it seems to be overlooked. There is much meaning behind the film, and it moved me a lot after I first saw it. The story contains the characters of Julie (Shirley Jones), a young lady who works at the mill, and Billy (Gordon McRae), a carousel barker. Both find love in the most unexpected place-each other. And because of that, they both lose their jobs. Then, when they both go to live with Julie's cousin, Billy, unemployed, is driven angry with nothing to do and abuses his wife, Julie. During the annual clam bake, his friend Jigger convinces him to take a knife to try to rob the mill owner of his money. Caught with nowhere to run, Billy accidently lands on his knife and is killed. (the scene where Julie comes to be by her husband's side in his final moments is very moving-my favorite scene.) Then up with the stars, he finds out he can go back for one day, to help his 15-year-old daughter (Julie just found out she was pregnant right before he was killed) keep from making the same mistake he did. During her graduation, he finally gets to show the love he has for his family, because he never had the chance to say it when he was alive. A very dramatic musical, about the golden chances you have here, and how quickly they can pass you by.

362338,2,6301759079,"The first and most glaring problem with the ""Carousel"" DVD is the fact that, while widescreen, the image has not been enhanced for 16 x 9 playback. However, that is not where the issues end. The layer change is one of the most abrupt I have ever encountered, pausing long enough to make one think the disc is locking up. The image itself also is full of defects. In Chapter 13 (the soliloquy) Gordon McCray's trousers, as well as some of the background, begin to shimmer, and blend in together. In at least two places, the image jumps. Most noticeable is the scene on the dock where Julie hugs Nettie. If you step through the images using slow motion, it is easy to see the jump was a transfer ""hiccup"".

This is a great movie....rather dark for a musical. And the music ranks as some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best. But let's hope Fox does the right thing and puts out a special edition.",1124064000,26,891,4.432926829268292

Although the film has already been analyzed and reanalyzed, it appears to resonate an ""Our Town"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" plotline accompanied with music and dance.  Shirley Jones (Julie Jordon) and Gordon MacRae (Billy Bigelow) are the star-crossed lovers who encounter social conflict as they pursue one another.  They come from different backgrounds, she, a cotton factory worker, and he, a Carousel barker. However, their love for one another does not separate them despite the fact that Bigelow experiences hard times, losing his job as a Carousel barker, and the most tragic, dying from a knife wound.  Julie presses on, and 15 years pass when Bigelow has the opportunity come back to earth to meet his teenage daughter, and for a brief moment during her graduation, express his love for Julie and his daughter.

Rodgers and Hammertein's CAROUSEL is a wonderful musical that the entire family will enjoy.  How can one not love the dramatic acting by Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae, and their glorious singing with songs, such as ""Never Walk Alone"" and ""If I loved You?"" The film contains a non-stop presentation of unforgettable and long drawn choreography scenes (check out the Riverdance like number) and period costumes that offer the viewer a glimpse of a Maine fishing village possibly during the nineteenth or turn of the century; the costumes and dance numbers are amazing enough to take a first or second look at one legendary production of a film.

CAROUSEL and its THX sound and re-mastered Cinemascope Technicolor will be a delight for the avid movie lover.  And for the music and dance lover, it is a classic that will keep you on your feet and your lungs singing for more.",1123545600,6,1777,4.919732441471572

Julie's an ingenue local and Billy's a carnival barker rogue.  Of course, after a great deal of romance, singing and dancing, tragedy strikes and their lives are altered irrevocably.

I grew up on O & H musicals and know them well.  Although simplisic, they capture the essence of innocent love which is irresistable to a romantic.  This is Jones' first major role and she would be paired up again a year later with MacRae in Oklahoma.  These films are classics because we can't help but sing the songs and suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours in a world where ""Grover's Corner"" still exists.",1122422400,3,732,4.76984126984127

362343,2,6301759079,"I find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and I also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with one exception, all the people who have written about them don't seem to care. ""Oklahoma"", ""Carousel"", ""South Pacific"" and ""King and I"" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well). Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future (ie observe the two versions of ""An Affair to Remember"") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That is anybody's guess, but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen DVD technology (""Sound of Music"" is fine and ""State Fair"" was made in non widescreen full screen format, an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen)",1111536000,59,1658,4.740484429065744
362374,4,6301759079,"Made in 1956, ""Carousel"" seems to be the least popular of the Rogers and Hammerstein classics...and I don't know why. Maybe it's because the musical isn't all sugary sweet and innocent and could even be considered a tear-jerker. I've never understood why this movie gets criticized so much. True there are a few things about it that even I am uncomfortable with but it is not a bad film by any means.

The story of ""Carousel"" revolves around Julie Jordan (Shirley Jones), a factory girl who falls in love with carousel barker Billy Bigelow (Gordon MacRae). Billy is an arrogant womanizer who dislikes being wrong and struggles with his emotions. Julie is a sweet girl who wouldn't hurt a fly. They go together as well as chalk and cheese, but get married anyway. A while after their wedding, Julie tells Billy that she's having a baby and while Billy is thrilled to begin with, his joy turns to panic as he worries about how he will provide for his unborn child. Billy's worry, and a suggestion from his less than honest friend Jigger (Cameron Mitchell) lead Billy to make the worst decision of his life.

I think one thing people dislike about the movie version of ""Carousel"" is that the first half of the story is told in flashback like sequences and I agree with anyone who thinks that this doesn't help the movie. I feel it would've been better if they had done it like the stage version and not included the awkward style of flashback storytelling because it really doesn't help the pacing. There is also a ballet sequence that lasts for some time and it doesn't look so good on screen...the ballet scene is something I think would also look better on a stage, since the way the ballet is played out makes it seem like it was made for stage rather than screen. Then there is the issue that everyone's talked about; the subject of wife beating. To me, the message really does come across that it's okay to let a man hit you, and even for a movie that was made in 1956 it leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. I didn't mind that Billy and Julie's relationship was complicated and that they never told each other the words ""I love you"", or that Billy never showed Julie any real affection. I like grit and drama even in a musical. I didn't even mind a main character being killed in a sudden and violent way. It all adds to the story. Without these plot points ""Carousel"" wouldn't be what it is; unique and interesting.

The songs in ""Carousel"" are excellent. There's the remarkable ""If I Loved You"", the memorable ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", and the charming ""When The Children Are Asleep"". There is Billy's seven minute solo song, the outstanding ""Soliloquy"" which completely defines the kind of man Billy Bigelow is and allows the viewer to see right into the character's soul.

While parts of the movie can be depressing, the ending is happy and uplifting as a musical ending should generally be. Thanks to the breath-taking performances from a great cast, memorable songs, in-depth characters and a good story ""Carousel"" is one of my favourite musicals and I recommend everyone give it a fair try at least once.",1111276800,8,3122,4.599640933572711
362375,4,6301759079,"In an age where a science fiction thriller can approach 3 hours, it's interesting that back in 1956 20th Century Fox decided that a movie running two and one half hours was long enough for a musical. So what did they do? Oh, just merely edit out two movie sequences containing the songs ""You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"" and ""Blow High, Blow Low"". Hello? And how long was the classic 1939 ""Gone With the Wind""? Over three hours? What a pity, because Rodgers & Hammerstein's wonderful ""Carousel"" (their personal favorite musical) deserved to be seen complete, no matter how long it may have been!! The deleted scenes added to the story and the songs were great. Luckily the two deleted songs can be heard on the VERY COMPLETE movie CD soundtrack (see my review of it). Since so many DVDs these days are coming out with Director's Cut versions of more recent movies, perhaps ""Carousel"" may one day be re-released in it's glorious entirety, that is unless the Hollywood morons of 1956 threw away the deleted film!! For the time being, let's be thankful for the ""Carousel"" of which I'm writing. Highly Recommended.

UPDATE:
On the recently reissued 2-CD set of ""Carousel"" is the 1934 french film ""Liliom"", in which ""Carousel"" is based upon. While an interesting bonus feature, it's ruined by subtitles that are flashed so quickly that they require speed reading skills. At other times there are extended moments in the film where subtitles don't even appear. A very erratic presentation, to say the least.",1109462400,47,1502,4.821705426356589

But there is one thing missing:  Rodgers and Hammerstein made seven movie musicals, but the boxed set only includes six.  They should have eliminated the second disc for The Sound of Music and instead included the remaining musical, Flower Drum Song.  Unfortunately, they have instead allowed this excellent movie to go out of print and are not producing it on either VHS or DVD.",1100995200,33,539,4.572916666666667
362377,4,6301759079,"Overall, an excellent movie that I would highly recommend. It really makes an emotional connection with the viewer. From the Golden Age of the Rogers & Hammerstein musicals; this one, however,is not a comedy.  In fact, it is pretty much a downer-- a tragic story that stands in contrast to the sunny, optimistic tone of most musicals of the 1950's.  The development of the characters is excellent.  Well-produced, visually appealing, with emotionally charged music and dance sequences.  I have only one complaint.  Shirley Jones certainly has a great voice and lots of screen presence, but I find her unconvincing in the death scene and therafter in the story--just too sweet and smily-face for such grim, dramatic material.

I did not interpret this movie as condoning wife-beating. Billy Bigelow (played superbly by Gordon MacRae) is portrayed as a human being with the full range of human feelings, good and bad, capable of both love and anger.  I think the problem with some of your reviewers is that such a portrayal does not fit in with the anti-male political corecness that is prevalent on this issue today.",1098403200,22,1115,4.994594594594594

The colors are rich, the scope wide, and the singing voices of even supporting players are magfnificent. The official review gavce picture a ""3 of 5"" while I think it is a ""4"". The only reason for the deduction is the letterbox format that creates black bars at top, bottom,and sides of my 16X9 high definition TV (no, DVD is not high definition, but it is digital). I like it much better when the, in this case the 2.55 aspect ratio, is enhanced for 16X9 so there are no side bars.

Now they still provide great music and, even if the style of the drama seems a little outdated, a wonderful glimpse of the simpler genre that we had then.  It seems that recent musicals such as Moulin Rouge and Chigago have taken many of the best features of the old R & H musicals and given them a new high-tech flair. It will be interesting to see if these modern productions are still as loved in forty or fifty years.
This boxed set gives a good balance of the R & H musicals and shows the creativity and flexibility that this duo added to theatre in their day.

362435,5,6301759079,"The VHS version of ""Carousel"" is good, but not like on a widescreen. The location of Maine is just beautiful and takes you back to that time in the 1870's. Shirley Jones captures the  essence of ""Julie"" and she gives her depth to stand up to ""Billy"". She falls completely in love with him no matter what he says to her. The issue of spousal abuse is evident when it's brought up that he hit her. She defends him because he is unhappy and gives her support to that. Billy on the other hand,isn't the type to be married as he can't do what he wants. (I wonder how Frank Sinatra would have played this part) Gordon MacRae is good and paired again with Shirley to play a different pair. They do have the screen chemistry here very much.  As far as the plotline for Billy goes, he changes his tune after he finds out he's to be a father and decides to provide for his family. But, when he and his ruffian friend, Jigger plan a robbery and it goes wrong, who is the one that is blamed?
Billy of course and he falls on his knife. No matter what kind of person he was, I think he has changed in all the time he was waiting to get into heaven. He almost spoils it by slapping his daughter. Louise seems to be just like he was at the age of fifteen. She is young and impressionable and thinks alot of people are conceited. Her schoolmate, the elder son of the Snow's isn't convinced of her actions. His mother, Julie's friend Carrie isn't too happy to be the mother of the many children and says so to her husband. Although, you know that she wanted to be ""Mrs. Snow"" as earlier in the play. But, the main focus is on Julie, Billy and their young daughter. The song ""If I Loved You"" seems to be the main theme of the star-crossed lovers. Does he love her? Does she love him? In the end you know they probably did love each other. The final scene of the graduation and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" is so touching and when you see Billy go back, you know he did something right. It gives you hope for Julie and Louise ,her daughter.  I think you have to have a heavy in this film as it would change the meaning of how it was written. You know that Billy is not a bad guy, but underneath a good guy.",1036368000,8,2183,4.131764705882353

THE GOOD NEWS: These are the greatest Rodgers & Hammerstien II musicals now in a Box set.  They have all been digitally remastered both picture & sound.  The colors, picture quality excellent and the sound crystal clear.  THE BAD NEWS:  All this work but  ""State Fair"" is lost in the WideScreen aspect ratio presentation.
Qualifying Statement:  I am a Home Theatre, HDTV - 55"" x 16:9  WidesScreen, Progressive Scan DVD, Dolby Prologic Sound System owner.  I have over 400 DVD movies ,mostly remastered, WideScreen (preserved in the original theatrical aspect ratio), Anamorphic or enhanced for 16:9 TV's.
NOTE: Full Screen - 4:3 (1:33 to 1 ratio) made for TV or film before 1953.  WideScreen - 4:3 letterbox (horizontal top & bottom black bars adjusted for any aspect ratio 165/185/225 to 1 etc. It is still letterbox) are movies made after 1953. (to compete with the popularity of Television)  ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN IS THE ONLY TRUE HDTV 16:9 PRESENTATION.  This format automatically adjusts to the Television being used.  To get the High Definition picture the DVD MUST BE ANAMORPHIC & ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISIONS!!!!!!
Now in SUMMARY:  STATE FAIR Full Screen Technicolor is the best presentation and the movie.  Oklahoma, Carousal, The King & I and South Pacific are WideScreen (4:3 Letterbox - small picture horizontal & vertical black bars) great color, music but small picture very disappointing.  Finally the Sound of Music was adjusted to an Anamorphic WideScreen but was not enhanced for the HDTV 16:9 format.  The results is a very grainy picture.
Bottomline - Now that the Home Theatre environment is becoming more common it is time to sort the GOOD from the BAD DVD's. This is only from a dedicated videophile of old classic movies who enjoys the total viewing & listening Home Theatre experience.  The movies themselves are the main ingredient but unfortunately Film Studios don't always give us what we think we are getting.  (Quality vs Quantity)  Another words they are already re-releasing DVD movies with these mentioned enhancements & special features for WideScreen TV's etc  SO WE NEED TO BUY RIGHT THE FIRST TIME & not repeat buying on the same movie as we upgrade our Televisions & Home Theatres.  REMEMBER - ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN & ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISIONS adjusts automatically to any size aspect ratio television!!!!!  ENJOY.",1017964800,606,2522,5.053268765133172

The carnival barker is frustrated by his inability to provide for his newly pregnant wife Julie, so he hauls off and hits her. What's the take on that in the movie? A song called ""What's the Use of Wonderin'"", which includes lines like, ""What's the use of wonderin' if he's good or if he's bad or if you like the way he wears his hat/ He's your feller and you love him, that's all there is to that "" In other words, try to be more understanding of why he has to beat you. Being a somewhat fantastical movie, Billy goes to heaven after falling on his own knife in a bungling robbery attempt,and up there sasses a head angel. The angel decides to let him return to earth to see the daughter born posthumously. On earth again, he finds his daughter alone on the beach front. When she understandably resists talking to a man she's never seen before, Billy does what comes naturally and slaps her. And how is that dealt with later? When the daughter recounts the strange episode to her mother, she asks, ""Did you ever get slapped but it felt like a kiss instead?""  I find these sentiments disturbing. ""Carousel"" is candy coating a serious problem, family abuse, and trying to tell us that as long as you understand a man's motives, you should accept any kind of treatment from him.

It can be difficult today to understand how groundbreaking this show was, not only in terms of subject matter, but in the way Rodgers and Hammerstein revolutionized the treatment of songs and their relationship to plot and characterization. Before R&H, few musicals addressed serious issues. The musical numbers tended to be showstoppers designed to showcase the strengths of the performer: it wasn't unusual to lift a number out of one show and insert into another to suit the whims of whoever was the star of the moment. After Rodgers & Hammerstein this became impossible: one could never, for example, take a song from The King and I and arbitrarily put it into Oklahoma! Gordon MacRae might not be John Raitt, but he's wonderful in this film, and Shirley Jones gives one of the best performances in the history of American movie musicals. There really isn't a weak link in this cast. I'll admit that, by today's standards, Carousel might seem a bit sentimental. If you're at all interested in American theatre history, you must see this.

362442,5,6301759079,"CAROUSEL represents Rodgers and Hammerstein's finest hour musically, the closest thing to Grand Opera the duo ever wrote. The 1956 film version showcases the best performance, before or since, that this magnificent score has ever received.  Beautifully photographed on location in CinemaScope and Technicolor, the poignant and tragic love story of barker Billy Bigelow and factory worker Julie Jordan unfolds with compassion and conviction. Gordon McRae gives the performance of a lifetime as Billy and his stunning rendition of the seven-minute ""SOLILIQUY"" is one of the greatest vocal performances of the 20th Century. Shirley Jones, ravishingly young and beautiful in only her second film appearance, is equally effective as Julie, a naive inexperienced young woman who finds in tragedy an inner strength she never knew existed within her.
CAROUSEL's greatest strength is, however, the great songs, which are woven seamlessly into the story. What else can you say about a score that includes such standards as ""YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE' and 'IF I LOVED YOU""?  In the capable hands of the legendary composer/arranger/conductor Alfred Newman, Richard Rodgers' soaring melodies are taken to heights of brilliance undreamed of in the Broadway original.  This is especially evident in ""Louise's Ballet.""  Ken Darby's excellent choral arrangements and wonderful vocals by MacRae, Jones, Claramae Turner, Barbara Ruick, Robert Rounseville and Cameron Mitchell all add up to the most perfect performance of this musical ever.
See this movie with someone you love and bring extra handkerchiefs. Also prepare to be dazzled with the glorious New England scenery rendered flawlessly on this superbly produced DVD and Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest score in genuine 6 channel discrete stereo.

362519,4,6301759079,"Until about a month ago, I knew almost nothing about this musical, Carousel.  I only had a vague awareness of one tune (""If I Loved You"").  However, I came across an LP (yes!) of the film soundtrack  and, on a whim, decided to buy it (what the heck, it was only 10 cents).  After listening to the entire LP, I was thoroughly astounded.  I happen to  love Hollywood musicals, yet here was a new one for me.  Shirley Jones and  Gordon McRae sounded fantastic on the soundtrack, and I quickly purchased  the DVD of Carousel.  Needless to say, it is one of my most pleasing DVD  purchases.  For those who do not know, Carousel is Roger and Hammerstein's  second Broadway musical, after Oklahoma, from the mid-1940s and was made  into a film in the mid-1950s. It was supposedly filmed in cinemascope 55  (actually 35) and reunited Jones and McRae, who had starred together in the  film version of Oklahoma.
The film was a flop when it was released,  unfortunately.  The reasons are multifold.  First, the film cut out a few  of the songs from the musical and cut out parts of other songs. These songs  are present in full length on the soundtrack.  Personally, this did not  bother me, as I felt the cut songs are a little weaker than the rest, and  the partially cut songs only had the intros cut, which wasn't a big deal  for me.  But it probably disturbed the purists during the film's initial  release.  Secondly, the musical, beautiful as it might be, is a bit of a  downer at the end, which might have turned some audiences off.  By the time  West Side Story made it to the big screen, audiences' tastes had changed  sufficiently but not yet at Carousel's initial release.  Thirdly, the  storyline is changed somewhat in the movie from the Broadway version; it  starts at the end and is told mostly in flashback.  I feel this was  probably a bad decision on the screenwriters but was probably their way of  compensating for the melancholy ending.  At any rate, on my DVD, I just  skip the first seven minutes and watch the film from there, so no problem.  Lastly, some of the original choreography from the play was changed in the  film; it was retained for the Louise's Ballet near the end but changed  elsewhere.  Again, this did not bother me, but then again, I haven't seen  the theater version, so I cannot judge for sure.  However, the choreography  for Louise's Ballet was quite beautiful.
Anyways, the story deals with  the bittersweet love between a young Maine girl and a carousel barker and  the consequences that befall them after they run off to get married and  return to the girl's coastal town.  Along the way, we get to hear some  truly breath-taking singing by Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae, especially  in ""If I Loved You,"" McRae's ""Soliloquy,"" and  ""What's the Use of Wond'rin.""  I've rarely heard better singing  in a musical.  And the rest of the singing cast is superb as well,  especially in the songs ""When the Children are Asleep"" and  ""You'll Never Walk Alone.""
The DVD has been THX-remastered and  it sounds quite heavenly (however, you need to change audio to hear it, as  the DVD will by default start with the original 2-channel soundtrack).  The  picture quality is good enough (not superb, since there are some blemishes  and the film's age shows here and there), but overall, the film looks  great.  Plus, we get to see some of the astounding cinematography of the  cinemascope process that usually gets chopped when seen on TV.
I'm glad I  finally saw this musical.  For whatever faults the film version may  possess, I think the music and the dancing and the poignancy of the  storyline make this truly a worthwhile film to see.  It is at any rate  better than South Pacific or King and I or State Fair.
For lovers of  musicals, I highly recommend Carousel!",963360000,16,3795,4.605421686746988
362520,5,6301759079,"Someone in another review mentioned that this movie contains sexist and spousal abuse issues.  I think that ""Carousel"" was supposed to have taken place in the early 1900's when women were often treated as  property and less than human.  I don't think the movie glorifies that.  In  fact, it is critical of Billy Bigelow's abuse of his wife.
Other than  the controversial themes examined in this movie, I think few would argue  that the score contains some of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's  best work, particularly ""If I Loved You"" and ""You'll Never  Walk Alone"" which are heartachingly beautiful pieces. And the  ""Carousel Waltz"" perfectly captures the feeling and wonder of the  carnival atmosphere where some of the musical is staged. This is one of the  earliest Broadway musicals that dared to explore serious subjects, i.e.  spousal abuse, violence within the context of a musical. That took guts!",961113600,4,912,5.081081081081081
362521,3,6301759079,"The film version of what I consider Rodgers and Hammerstein's best stage production, ""Carousel,"" has generally been dismissed by critics and those familiar with the stage show as a poor representation of the  stage version.  To some degree, that is true.  Yes, the screenplay does  ""soften"" it by giving away a major plot point at the beginning of  the movie, so it would be easier to take.  (I won't say more, in case you  haven't seen it)  And some of the score was deleted from the final print,  which hurts it in the beginning.  On stage, ""If I Loved You"" is  dialogue with musical interludes leading up to the song itself.  It is a  beautiful scene, as the music is used to express emotions the characters  can not speak, to thrilling effect.  But on film, it's just dialogue  leading up to the (shortened) song, which cuts away some of the power and  impact.  The spell cast on stage is not to be found here, though Gordon  McRae and Shirley Jones sing well.  The deleted ""You're a Queer One,  Julie Jordan"" is also missed.
But after the dissapointing beginning,  ""along come"" the spirited rendition of ""June Is Bustin' Out  All Over"" by the cast.  From then on, the film is much more engaging  and better all around.  McRae and Jones, while not really up to par  dramatically, are capable of emoting enough and remain vocally stellar,  which is what we paid for, anyway, (though it shouldn't have been that  way).  McRae's ""Soliloquy"" is a true tour de force, and his  reprise of ""If I Loved You"" is truly poigniant. Jones'  ""What's the Use of Won'drin"" is beautiful and touching.  The rest  of the cast is fine, too, and certain of the later scenes retain the power  of the stage version and are just as touching.  Unfortunatly, I haven't  seen this in widescreen or on the big screen, so I can't vouch for the  much-lauded visual scope of Boothbay Harbor, Maine,  but I'm sure it's  spectacular.  (Nope, it's not all that exciting in pan-and-scan)
This is  worth seeing, especially, I'm sure, in widescreen, but what you really  should do is get the film's soundtrack, which restores the deleted songs  and many of the deleted verses of other songs to better effect, and a  decent cast recording of the stage version, and see a good stage production  in your area.  Only then will you truly experience the beauty and power of  this magnificent musical.",960854400,14,2361,4.630170316301703
362522,5,6301759079,"I remember seeing ""West Side Story"" on the stage in an early run. The finale ..so downbeat was stunning. It left the audience in awe. The assumption was that ALL great musicals had the great wrapup and exhuberent  finale..however , as in West Side Story and this film..the finale of hope  and accomplishment are meloncholy..and if so leave a tremendous impression  on the viewer.
You can vicariously live through Billy Bigelows ordeal of  lost love and its effects..and to see ones child grow up in the spirit is  something.to remember. A farely simple plot is turned into one terrific  musical a  must be seen on dvd!",960595200,5,618,4.773584905660377
