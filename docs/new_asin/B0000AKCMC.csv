1907991,4,B0000AKCMC,"It would not take much for me to become like this. I do feel it's sad but in a small way I understand. Perhaps if I ever find my self all alone in this world I would retreat into films. Anyway, these people seem happy enough and thank god they have films. Films can be a very simple outlet for people who might otherwise be up to no good.",1181520000,,338,3.9130434782608696
1907992,3,B0000AKCMC,"These movie lovers seem to only want to talk about movies and I suspect all but one of them prefer their own company. They don't have jobs (one does) and live frugally with the exception of this obsession with films. All live in small apartments (maybe rented rooms) crammed with books, movies and movie paraphernalia. You also see plastic bags and junk laying around. So this tells me they have mental illness of some sort.

I am an introvert like them. I'm also messy so I don't like having too much stuff. That way my home isn't cluttered with belongings never being used. So perhaps under the right circumstances I would be like them. Scary!",1155427200,3,645,4.608695652173913
1907993,4,B0000AKCMC,"Cinemania is a fascinating and very funny documentary that focuses on the lives of five New York film-lovers.  The men (and woman) this film chronicles are not simply erudite, artsy types who can appreciate Bergman.  They are people who have literally re-arranged their lives in order to make movie-watching their primary focus.  They are all articulate and funny.  None of them are normal ... they range from strangely overzealous to OCD to downright creepy.  And - while it is frequently hilarious to listen to their testimonies (one cinephile suggested that he's ripped food out of a too-noisy movie-goers hands; another has memorized the precise running time for practically every movie he's ever seen; and another is permanently banned from the MOMA (I'll let you figure out why)), it is also a little sad that these people get more fulfillment from movies than they do from their everyday lives.

This documentary excels most when it asks *why* these people need to watch movies (the answers, I think, also speak to the pleasure each of us gets from escapism).  There is a scene where Jack, the main ""character"" in the film, insists that he could only make love to Rita Hayworth in black-in-white.  It's an interesting and telling concept.  Cinemania's greatest weakness is probably its amateurish production qualities.  Rather than come across as quirky and immediate, they are more along the lines of frustrating.  But this is only a minor complaint.  Overall, I would still recommend Cinemania.  I can pretty much guarantee that, if you give it a shot, you'll be entertained and amazed.",1147132800,7,1595,5.041984732824427
1907994,4,B0000AKCMC,"The Fear comes from the fact that potentially I'm not so far from the characters depicted in this film.  I'm also suffer from breakdowns produced by romantic failures, and I'm also have seen four movies in a row for three or four days in film festivals, when outside is a sunny day and the beach is near the movie theater.  The Fascination comes from the fact that those people are not exactly crazy.  Jack is even an extremely interesting and intelligent person.  The fact that he is alone has to do more with the failings of the world (and his society in particular) than with his personal characteristics.  This movie trascends morbidity because what some of those people have to say about cinema affects in some way or another each of us.  Given that a segment of the western population passes their days watching horrible programs in television, the activity of these five people can be seen as revolutionary as taking a trip outside the Matrix.  If Krakauer was right, maybe is time to ask Jack what he thinks about the future of Western civilization. I hope (even when I know he's right) that his answer will not be close to that of Houellebecq.",1143676800,4,1152,4.617647058823529
1907995,5,B0000AKCMC,"If you hate the world or don't understand what direction we're headed and escape into movies to avoid pain, you should realize you're not alone.  Watch this movie or you're a nerd.",1123027200,2,180,4.625
1907996,2,B0000AKCMC,"I love film, but I really didn't understand what this film was about. It follows a quintet of New Yorker film buffs but instead of painting their infatuation as romantic and wonderous, it reveals them as entirely disfunctional individuals who don't contribute anything, live on disability, and suffer from mental illness.

I was hoping for more of a homage to film from the perspective of maybe it's most educated and animated viewers, instead of such a personal look into the lives of such a sad group of lonely adults living in poverty on the edge of eviction.

If it was the intention of the filmmakers to illustrate avid film buffs as hopelessly depressed OCD patients, then I have to ask.. What's the point?",1116115200,4,712,4.780487804878049
1907997,4,B0000AKCMC,"In the protection of the theater darkness the cinephiles withdraw from society in an attempt to seek something better and more fulfilling.  Background sound from a reel spins while 24 frames per second is pulled through a ray of light that projects a visual experience which could offer an escape, possible enlightenment, emotional experience, and more.  The light displays people such as Julie Andrews, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and others as they move through tragedy, comedy, danger, and love among many adventures, which sometimes are true and sometimes complete fiction.  This story, however, is completely true as the characters of the documentary, Cinemania, present the world in which they feel most at home.

Film has an alluring inspiration as it mesmerizes the audience through light and sound at a safe distance.  A viewer that sits down in front of a screen can, in peace, experience happiness, love, heartache, danger, and fear while knowing what is on the screen cannot physically hurt them.  The film provides a two sensory experience (visual and auditory) that can enlighten the viewer in such a manner that the viewer can learn something from the cinematic experience.  Thus, at the end of the film there should be a slight change within the viewer as the film offers something to reflect upon, or an experience that affects the audience.  Escapism could be defined as habitually removing one's self from reality into a safe environment where mere visual invention creates an opportunity for cerebral activity and entertainment.  The characters in Cinemania seem to do this several times on a daily basis as they base their life on this visual and auditory escape.

The documentary follows Roberta, Jack, Eric, Bill, and Harvey and how they live their lives and how film affects their life as a whole.  Through their escapism, which is even discussed in the film, the film depicts how they plan when to see a film, how they find out where they show the best print of the film, and the fastest route to the theater where the film is to be shown in order to maximize the number of viewings.  If they would miss a film, it would be a disaster, as if they missed an opportunity to find essential wisdom, or a life experience such as a first love.  However, they miss birthday parties, weddings, and funerals with no hesitation as film is their life.  They do not hold jobs as they live month to month on disability and welfare money with a constant threat of being evicted.  A psychologist would deem them to have a severe addiction as it negatively affects their social, financial, and physical health to what would be considered the norm.  Nonetheless, they are aware of their habits as they love the moment when the theater gradually darkens and the projector display its magic on the screen.

The magic of film and cinema is an illusion that affects all viewers in one way or another, but for Roberta, Jack, Eric, Bill, and Harvey it is as important as breathing.  Cinema has hexed them into a state where they must participate as frequently as possible while the hectic life of New York surrounds them.  A good thing is that they live in New York as it is the only city that could be compared to the cinematic Mecca, Paris.  This means that they get to see several advance screenings.

Cinemania is a film that most viewers would find interesting, intriguing, amusing, and much more as it conveys the story of five eccentric New Yorkers and their cinematic obsessions.  Many film enthusiasts could find a resemblance to themselves in the film, yet most do not want to recognize their own peculiarities through this documentary.  When the end credits roll and the darkened theater is slowly illuminated we know the film is over, but do they?",1103414400,3,3777,4.830745341614906
1907998,4,B0000AKCMC,"Here's a problem most moviegoers don't have: scheduling conflicts. If you want to see a movie, it's probably playing at the multiplex all day and evening and you just pick a time and go. But the five people in Cinemania have every film showing anywhere in New York City to choose from, first run movies, film classics, festivals, films shown in museums and small screening rooms. Two of the men have worked out a computerized system to figure it all out. A movie they want to see might only be playing three times in the coming week, at the same time as one or more other movies they want to see. They need help from databases and decision trees. Another guy will only see a movie if it's a good print. He has the phone number of all the projection booths, and calls ahead of time to discuss the quality of the print. Then he brings his cell phone with him into the theater; if something goes wrong with the projection, he doesn't want to have to leave his seat. He calls instead. It's these kinds of details that make this movie fascinating, and fun to watch, in a head-shaking, ""I can't believe this"" sort of way.
It was also sad to see these people driven by an obsession that maybe even they don't understand. It was hinted that at least two of the film buffs didn't know as much about film as they thought they did, and didn't have discerning tastes. That was good stuff, and made me wonder, why do they do it, then? Ultimately, maybe the question can't be answered. There were five people, and five different, complex reasons. I think the movie gave as full a picture of what they were about as is possible in 80 minutes. So even though I wanted to know, and understand, more, I give the movie 4 stars and will watch it again.
I do wish there'd been more of sense of the mix of movies they all watched. It seemed that most of them did see a fair number of first run movies, but the documentary didn't get into that much. In one of the deleted scenes, Roberta discusses at great length her reaction to ""Pearl Harbor."" Suddenly she believes that the other person (another of the cinemaniacs) isn't understanding a word she's saying, and she walks away, frustrated, angry, unable to communicate. There are many small scenes like that one, that show so much just by letting the people talk.",1076198400,12,2292,4.4336492890995265
1907999,5,B0000AKCMC,"I don't know what that other review is talking about! Dissorganized?  I teach a course in film editing and this is a perfectly structured little gem - and funny, and human, and really touching.  Yes, it's sad at times (these are fringe characters scraping by on the edges of the big city), but it is also very compassionate.
CINEMANIA is a near-verite look at some of the most whacked out film obsessives you could ever hope to find, but it reveals them in subtle layers - they're self-aware, smart, dangerously brilliant at moments. I found myself thinking about these people long after I saw the film (and was lucky enough to see it on the big screen!) There's no narration (no obnoxious Michael Moore-type leading you by the hand throught he film - thank GOD) so, sure, it may seem haphazard, but I was caught up in it moment-to-moment. I found it fascinating structurally - seeming to anticipate your questions about these folks and then answering them.  I did miss hearing about their past lives a bit, but it seems a very in-the-moment experience, very much like the lives of the characters - as if there IS no other life beyond the confines of the silver screen.
People familiar with more verite styles of documentary filmmaking or brilliant personal essay films like Varda's ""The Gleaners and I"" will love this.  It's a great homage to our love of cinema.",1069113600,13,1363,4.690376569037657
1908000,5,B0000AKCMC,"Cinemania was the best thing at last year's Edinburgh International Film Festival by several hundred leagues.
The fact that StereoTotal provide the soundtrack is the proverbial icing on the cake. Nobody with any sense or taste could be disappointed with this movie. Simple as that. Roll on October 7th.",1058659200,5,302,5.183673469387755

7997511,4,B0000AKCMC,"I liked this a bit more than I expected to - actually, I was really loving it while watching it, but a day or so of thinking about it got me to considering it's flaws and limitations more. Still, this is an interesting portrait of five of New York's most relentless, hardcore cinephiles, circa 2001 - people who make me and most of my Chicago cinephile friends from the 1990s look like pikers. The title ""cinemania"" is very apropos, as both the filmmakers and the filmed-buffs often see their cinema love and lonely, obsessive lifestyles as a disease or addiction more than as a passion. But a couple of them are quite articulate and do make attempts to explain it as a valid way of life outside of society's norms, and even if they're not perfectly happy we get the idea that this isn't as bad a choice as others they might have made.

This certainly could have been longer, and had a wider scope to encompass some of the less desperate examples of the bree, like I and some of my friends used to be - ok, we were in Chicago, but there were New Yorkers much like us who saw hundreds of films in the cinema every year but still had decent jobs, friends, even significant others.  One gets the impression that most of the cinemaniacs have embraced their hobby as much out of desperation and the lack of anything else useful or important to do with their time.  Despite the bleakness and the one-note tone of much of it, though, I guess I still think it's worth a view, and heck, I have known people pretty close to these folks, like the guy in the trench coat who was at EVERY showing EVER at the Film Center in downtown Chicago in the early 90s, and who seemed to be the loneliest man in the city.",1380153600,3,1697,4.330188679245283
7997512,1,B0000AKCMC,"Worst movie ever made?  Simply avoid this awfully sorry mess.  The documentary details the lives of some New Yorkers who have decided to replace their own life with film, immersing themselves so completely in their fantasy that they cannot and do not live any meaningful existence.  They are unclean, small people, who seem incapable of helping themselves, let alone others.  These are not individuals like film critics who intelligently review movies for recommendations to others.  These are people who rather rush to see 5 films every day in different movie houses, rather than even spend money to cook and eat, let alone socialize.

In summary, depressing movie, depressing people.",1379289600,,685,5.238532110091743
7997513,5,B0000AKCMC,I was given an assignment in my psychology of personality class that required me to watch this film. I was surprised with how good it is. Keep in mind this really is a story of mental illness similar to hoarders. It was amazing to see just what people will sacrifice to go to simple films. It is very sad but enlightening. I would recommend this to anyone who is into the shows about hoarding.,1376611200,,393,4.324324324324325
7997514,4,B0000AKCMC,"When does a hobby become an obsession? That's the question underlying Cinemania, a documentary about a group of New Yorkers whose lives revolve around going to the movies. The people in Cinemania are strange, interesting characters.

Among others, viewers get to meet:
- a man who intentionally constipates himself so that he won't miss any of his films and
- a woman who obsessively collects movie ticket stubs. When one of the ticket takers desecrates her ticket stub, the woman gets into a fight with the ticket taker and is banned from the theater. Later, the woman dons a disguise and unsuccessfully attempts to sneak back into the theater.

Cinemania is a great slice of life that lets viewers draw their own conclusions. I recommend it.",1307664000,,743,4.888888888888889
7997515,4,B0000AKCMC,"If you think you're a movie buff... you have to watch this. This documentary basically follows several people who live and breathe film... sometimes to a shocking degree. If you're a really casual movie watcher, this probably won't be worth your while because you simply won't get it, and more than likely you'll think these people are certifiable.

Now... for those of us who consider ourselves at least on a basic level movie nuts... this will be fascinating and at times quite funny. I found myself relating to certain aspects of these individuals lives, and identifying with why they love movies... even though I can't claim I'm anywhere near as much of a film fanatic as they are. Well made and worth a watch for the right crowd. 4/5 stars.",1294358400,,745,4.730769230769231
7997516,5,B0000AKCMC,"I thought this was a really great documentary. The quality looks like it was filmed with a consumer-level camcorder instead of a professional camera but that doesn't hurt the film in this case. This doc follows and tells the story of several mentally ill people who love movies more than anyone should. One guy saw 1000 movies in an 8-month period. If you enjoy docs about unsual people, you'll like this.",1257033600,2,405,4.71830985915493
7997517,2,B0000AKCMC,"This is advertised as a documentary about ultimate film fans. What it actually is is a film about several very sad, mentally ill people on disability who spend most of their day going to the movies. One appears to be psychotic. Another clearly has an anxiety disorder (pressured speech, inappropriate giggling). Another may be an obsessive-compulsive with psychotic tendencies. One has a history of being violent and attacking people - usually theater workers. They live in squalor, are hoarders, eat nothing but junk food, have no romantic or sexual relationships, dream about unattainable women (always movie stars - one even has sexual fantasies in black and white). Rather than being a look at super-fans - this is a look at severely disturbed, pathetic people who are trapped in their illnesses and have little hope of ever living complete lives. If this interests you , get the movie. I found it depressing. It also confirms my belief that some people simply cannot be helped because they are beyond help. All we can do is avoid these people and be glad that they cannot afford to live near us where they might attack us if their sick routines are disturbed.",1235520000,2,1164,4.883838383838384
