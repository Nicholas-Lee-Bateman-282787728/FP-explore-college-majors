1192232,4,B000006584,"The phrase ""A Hammer Film"" used to symbolize ""low budget British horror quickie"" at the time they were being cranked out, but of course the passage of time has proved how influential this studio's  output really was. ""Captain Kronos"" embodies the Perfect Hammer  Movie...great atmospherics,Caroline Munro,clever, well-written dialogue,  ravenously beautiful actresses (Caroline Munro), and genuine suspense. Oh,  and did I mention Caroline Munro? I have to single out the dialogue in this  one...there are some particularly droll and cheeky exchanges,almost  rivalling those in ""Young Frankenstein"" (although not as broad  and Borscht-Beltish).And then there's that patented Hammer production  design and overall ""look""...there have been attempts over the  years, but very few directors have been able to duplicate it (Neil Jordan's  1985 debut ""The Company of Wolves"" comes the closest).

1192233,4,B000006584,"Captain Kronos is a vampire film that focuses more on the vampire hunter and his pursuit of a youth draining vampire.  This film also combines some swashbuckling action with a vampire film.  This film is different from most  vampire films, in that  the identity of the vampire is somewhat of a  mystery and we see a deliberate professional vampire hunter attempting to  deduce who the vampire is and how to stop them.  The acting is campy in  spots, but overall effective for this film. It is really a shame that the  sequel never came about.  This film is highly recommended for fans of  horror and action movies.",943920000,9,614,4.644859813084112

Recalling my first time having seen it decades ago, I came to a complete jumble of mistakes as to who the vampire was.  It's still interesting to watch the red herrings the plot lays down.  Caroline Munro plays in it as the Gypsy girl, and she is never able to be anything but charming and beautiful regardless of the role she takes.",1485561600,,441,4.419753086419753
1192265,5,B000006584,"A vampire movie that allows the vampire to do its business during daylight.  It doesnt feed on blood; it feeds on youth, draining its victims into premature old age and death.  Enter Captain Kronos vampire hunter and his trusty sidekick.  They have their ways of detecting different types of vampires.  In this case dead toads are employed.  With the help of an old friend, they set about trapping a clever vampire killing all the young women in the district.

A very stylish film thanks to writer/director Brian Clemens.  (With fellow producer Albert Fennell they were responsible for the Emma Peel years of the TV series The Avengers.)  The camera work is extraordinary, filled with carefully composed scenes, a wonderful use of light and shadow.  The score was provided by Laurie Johnson who did much of scoring for the TV series The Avengers.

1192293,5,B000006584,"Just finished watching ""Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter,"" a Hammer Production released by Paramount Studios.
My first encounter with ""Captain Kronos"" - which stars the ever lovely Caroline Munro - was back in 1974 when I was reading about it in Starlog Magazine.  If memory is serving me correctly, ""Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter"" was supposed to be the first in a series of movies featuring this mysterious vampire hunter and his scholarly companion.
What I remember most about the article is that Caroline Munro - who was kind enough to autograph a copy of ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"" for me when Steve Orchard mentioned how much I liked the movie to her - said what she loved most about this role is she got to play a ""bad girl"" who does good; which she brilliantly does in this movie.
Sadly, ""Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter"" never made its way to any of the theaters at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina during its initial release, so I never got to see it on the big screen and I had to patiently wait until it was released on DVD to see it - and then I foolishly let it languish on a shelf in one of my DVD cases until I hunted it down - as my lovely sister Selma, and devoted minions Jeff H. and Zack will say: ""Not an easy task with nearly 1,000 DVDs to hunt amongst for one title.""
""Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter"" is classic Hammer Horror with intriguing heroes who have compelling back stories and a mystery that enough red herrings and twists to completely cause the viewer to immerse himself in the story - which is rather straightforward.
After receiving an urgent letter from an old friend, Captain Kronos and his friend and traveling companion the Professor ride like bats out of hell to visit and investigate.  Young women have been dying mysterious deaths - bloody and drained of all youth.
Unlived time, not blood, is what the vampire is after - making it a rather unique one.  As the Professor notes: ""There are many types of vampires who can't be killed by the traditional stake through the heart and who can safely walk in the sun.""
Captain Kronos himself was once a victim of vampires - his own mother and sister.  It's shown that he survived a wound that should have killed him in a previous war.  He and the Professor have unique occult knowledge; and though virginity is not required for this vampire hunter, Kronos does commit some interesting rituals that suggest he's a bit more than human and maybe a vampire himself.  The professor does sleep in a wagon covered with garlic blooms when he and Kronos are on the road.
Captain Kronos definately deserved more adventures and those could be done on audio now - with the Colonial Radio Theatre on the air being the ideal home.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1422748800,,2737,4.564154786150713
1192314,3,B000006584,Not bad but no idea where all the 5 star reviews are coming from. The acting isn't bad but it's a long way from great. The music though...the music is awful and there is nearly as much of it as there is dialog.,1421193600,,210,3.9069767441860463

1192316,4,B000006584,"CAPTAIN KRONOS: VAMPIRE HUNTER is simultaneously frustratingly bad and brilliantly executed. The film tells the story of a wandering vampire hunter who has responded to the urgent call of an old friend who is concerned about the recent murder of a number of young women. These women have had their very youth stolen from them. The premise and the screenplay are quite brilliant and the means of vampire detection - in particular the use of dead toads - demonstrates a great deal of creativity. Sadly, the more ingenious elements of the film are undermined by odd cinematography and extremely poorly choreographed fight scenes. In a film that ends with a climactic duel between the protagonist and a recently risen vampire lord, poor choreography is nigh unforgivable.

I say nigh unforgivable because there is so much to like in this movie. People often ask why there are so many remakes. Here is a film crying out for a new version. With only moderate tweaks to the screenplay, but significant updating of film craft, the remake would be an almost guaranteed classic.",1414022400,2,1068,4.933333333333334

So the locals call for Captain Kronos and Hunchback sidekick.  Along the way to help the townspeople the good Captain Rescues Caroline Munro, who is as sexy as always. The movie keeps you guessing about who the vampire really is and how to kill the monster.  This vampire can only be killed with Steel and so we get a climatic sword fight at the end of the film.

1192346,5,B000006584,"Wow, this is a very unusual vampire movie. The hero is a sword wielding vampire killer! He even uses both hands! The movie features several sword fighting scenes with human attackers. There is a scene where a special sword is made for the showdown. And then the climactic scene with our hero and a sword fighting vampire villain is a doosy. In my opinion, it's one of the better sword fights in cinematic history. It's unusual, different, messy, sloppy at times but also realistic and ultimately ... it ends with glorious precision. I am surprised that they never did a sequel. Just an aside, the cover photo does not show the lead actor, which is strange because the blonde guy who plays the vampire killer is very charismatic. The movie is also a whodunit affair as you'll probably never guess who is the vampire until it's revealed in the final battle.

Not to fear, fair-haired, handsome young Captain Kronos, a master of the sword, comes riding in on horseback, accompanied by his hunchback assistant Grost in a horse-drawn cart.  Kronos is duty-bound to kill vampires.  (We later learn that Kronos himself was bitten by a vampire, and his parents were apparently vampires, but he overcame the curse. Ergo, he bears a grudge.)  Among Kronos' first encounters is a beautiful woman (Caroline Munro, as the ravishing, dark-haired Carla) whose arms and head are trapped in a stockade, as punishment for doing something or other wrong on a Sunday.  Immediately, Kronos smashes the lock, frees her, and offers her a ride.  Romance doth ensue.  The film is somewhat more engaging than most Hammer films, with some clever touches -- burying dead toads in little boxes, then checking the boxes, and if the toads have come to life, there is indication of a vampire in the area, for one -- albeit true to most of the Hammer films, the script is a bit stilted, formal and stagy, which is to say it is lacking in dramatic tension.  Most of the Hammer films suffered from mediocre writing, and lack of character depth and motivation.  Nevertheless, there's a certain campiness to ""Captain Kronos,"" and he is lightning quick with a sword, as evidenced by his cutting a bullying barfly played by Ian Hendry down to size.  The plot has holes in it, and indeed even in the film's climactic sword fight, it is unclear who the culprit behind all of these attacks actually is.",1395273600,2,1732,4.920962199312715

Some of the swashbuckling is impressive, especially Captain Kronos' [SPOILER]defeat of armed thugs at an inn. Caroline Munro is stunning as always, but she's mostly used as decoration.

It's a Hammer movie, there's a complicated vampire-family plot, the vampires suck the youth out of people... eventually Captain Kronos triumphs (how could it be otherwise?).

1192366,4,B000006584,"...that's the sad truth concerning CAPTAIN KRONOS: VAMPIRE HUNTER. Intended to revive Hammer's flagging fortunes and start a new series of films, neither happened and what is left is a fascinating curio and the unfufilled promise of what might have been. Brian Clemens, the man behind DR JEKYLL & SISTER HYDE as well as THE AVENGERS, came up with the idea of a knight errant who travels the European countryside with his faithful hunchback squire ridding the land of vampires. The catch here, as the squire informs us, is that ""there are as many different species of vampires as there are birds of prey"" and as many different ways to get rid of them. What works for one would be ineffective against another. Had a series of films (or a TV show) come to fruition, then a different type of vampire with a different way of being destroyed would be featured the next time around.

The vampires in this movie drain their victims of youth not blood and stakes are useless against them. This allows Clemens to have a final duel to the death involving a swordfight in the tradition of Robin Hood or Captain Blood (had this been made in the 1930s, Errol Flynn would have played the part). German actor Horst Janson as the titular character fills the bill well enough while John Cater (the commissioner in the DR PHIBES films) as Grost his assistant is absolutely perfect. Caroline Munro is a delight as the village girl making the most of her onscreen time and doing the best job I've ever seen in not blinking her eyes during the film's finale. Hammer veteran John Carson plays a key role as Dr. Marcus and Brit horror regular Ian Hendry is great fun as a tavern bully.

It feel like there is a lot of backstory to the guy and his hunchbacked sidekick (a hunchbacked Dr. Van Helsing understudy, I love his tactic for using dead frogs to track down the vampires... an authentically bizarre bit of hokum). It also seems like the movie sets up for a recurring set of villains in the dark-aligned Carstein family.
I'm really surprised someone hasn't picked up this swashbuckling vampire action flick idea and run with it. The ultra-lame 'Van Helsing' movie being the only thing close to it but too focused on gadgets and FX.

1192399,2,B000006584,"Hammer Film Productions, 91 minutes, released 1974, ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" is a British film about a mercenary and his hunchbacked scholarly friend who search out and destroy vampires.  This story requires taking down a grave marker and forging it into a sword.  The vampire in this story drains victims of youth, so the vampire can stay young.  There are several methods of killing a vampire, according to this story; of which several are experimented with.  The R-rating isn't for nudity.
Starring Horst Janson; John Carson; Shane Briant; Caroline Munro; John Cater; Lois Daine; Ian Hendry; Wanda Ventham; William Hobbs; Brian Tully; Robert James; Perry Soblosky; Paul Greenwood; Lisa Collings; John Hollis; and others.
When this film was released, no doubt it was popular and taken seriously.  That was 37 years ago.  I suggest instant view rental or getting the DVD for as cheap as possible, used.  Very, very slow moving; almost no action sequence until the very end (laughable even then); ridiculous acting; limited sets; few characters of merit; and not much for background music score.  Expect this DVD movie to be more of a parody of vampire films; it is disjointed and was originally meant to be a pilot for a series that never happened.
This film reminds me of people who say they watched the James Bond 007 films for the acting ability of Roger Moore, Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, or Daniel Craig.  Women did, yes.  Men lied so their wives or parents wouldn't chastise them for the Christian porn of ogling well-endowed women scantily clad.  In ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" anybody who says this film deserves a 5-star review - that big of a nonsense lie should be remembered as a scourge against future review credibility.  But everybody is entitled to their own opinion, and so it continues to ring true what an old guy told me; ""There's all kinds of people in this world, and there ain't none missin'.""

1192401,5,B000006584,"In approximately the 17th century, fearless and dashing vampire hunter Captain Kronos is summoned to a small village by an old friend to discover and destroy a new breed of vampiric killer. With him, he brings his faithful assistant, the kind and intelligent, hunchbacked Professor Grost, and a comely gypsy girl named Carla he rescued from the stocks along the way. The trio go about their dangerous business confidently but cautiously, as this breed of youth-sucking vampire is so different that its weaknesses are as much a mystery as its identity.

In 1974, Hammer Studios, the legendary house that brought Christopher Lee's Dracula and Peter Cushing's Frankenstein to the screen, decided it was time to shake up their style a bit and turned to writer/director Brian Clemens for a new take on the vampire movie. What he gave them was ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"", one of the best films the studio would produce and one of the most unique and enjoyable period vampire films around. Despite poor box office returns, Kronos has deservedly become a cult classic since its release. The film was just too good to deny, with its swashbuckling, super-cool hero and unconventional vampire plot. It's not surprising that Kronos reminds one a bit of a Tarantino film at times. This Spaghetti Western-esque vampire flick is actually a fave of the American director and many other filmmakers today. The performances, visuals, music, and script are all fantastic, and it's a shame the film did not hit it big, as sequels were definitely part of the plan for this Bond style slayer/lover. But, alas, all we managed to get was this single, excellent film, so we must make the best of it. If you're a fan of films like Seven Samurai, Vampire Hunter D, Kill Bill, From Dusk Till Dawn, Clint Eastwood westerns, and even appreciate the non-CGI aspects of ""Van Helsing"", along with Hammer's other long line of great horror flicks, you should be able to get some big enjoyment from ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"".

The DVD itself isn't much to get thrilled about, aside from having the enhanced widescreen movie itself. Bonus features are limited to a commentary with the writer/director, female lead, and a genre historian. A trailer would have been nice to get too. Still, it's great to have this movie on DVD, and having a commentary track too is also very cool. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up before you grab any other vampire movies. There are several good ones out there, but Kronos is among the best.",1281916800,2,2505,4.864168618266979
1192402,5,B000006584,"I admit not knowing a lot of the history of the making of this film, but I must say I never had so much fun watching another one of Hammer's over the top vampire films.

Director Brian Clemens both wrote and directed this unusual take on vampirism.  As explained in the film, there are various species of vampire and they don't all die by the same method.  The stake & cross & garlic only work on the bloodsuckers, such as Dracula-types.

Kronos (Horst Janson) needs to polish off a vampire that sucks the youth from the bones of comely young women of the village as they blithely pick flowers and frolic in the streams.  The fun comes when Kronos and his hunchbacked friend are searching for ways to kill this particular vampire.

Unfortunately one of his best friends from the war, a surgeon by the name of Dr. Marcus, gets infected with the 'sucking the life force' type vamps.  After several attempts of hanging, stabbing and so on, he stumbles onto the solution.

Also joining our gang is a very young and sexy Carla, who was being pilloried for dancing on a Sunday.  Can you imagine?  Played in a cheesy, sexy style by Bond girl Caroline Monroe, she adds some romance and attractiveness to the film.  And she acts as bait!

Not to give a lot away, but I was impressed with several things:

The script was peppered with lines like: He knows as much about vampirism as you can fit into a flea's codpiece!""  Hilarious!

The tough guys in the bar looking for a fight but no match for Captain Kronos!

The photography was awesome as well (to use an overused word).  Clemens use of framing and shadow were reminiscent of horror films of the silent era, as suspense and horror are built through the haunting melodies of Laurie Johnson.  Great soundtrack.

The film struck my attention in the first place because of a comment made by Blade writer David Goyer that Captain Kronos was the first film to delve into different species of vampire and how this film had inspired him to create Blade (as well as from the comic book by Marvel).  Let's concentrate on the vampire hunter rather than the vampire.

Hey, perhaps Stephanie Meyer's Twilight vamps are a different species too, who sparkle in the sunlight and play baseball?  But I digress!

The only real cons in the film are the clearly low-budget constraints of the film by Hammer.  The fight scenes were not all that realistic but were fun to watch.  The leg kicks miss by a mile and yet you hear the Thud or the Wham of the hit.

And of course having Caroline Monroe take her clothes off is worth the price of admission (joking, sort of).

Please see this film!  It has blood, sex, swordplay and a little cheese in this great, original 1970s Hammer classic.

1192403,5,B000006584,"In the English countryside, there has been bizarre murders of ladies and a few men dying in a village nearby with their lips in blood and looked like they aged prematurely to being old. It's the work of a vampire who does not suck blood but drains energy/lifeforces/youth instead of blood who has been terrorizing the village, it's up to a doctor named Marcus (John Carson) to call upon a famed vampire killer named Kronos (Horst Janson) with hump-backed assistant Grost (John Cater) as together with a lovely gypsy woman Carla (Caroline Munro) they must track down and fight these soul-sucking vampires or else the village will be drained.

One of the best vampire movies of all time and one of Hammer's greatest hits! this UK production is a very original and outstanding vampire movie. This one features energy vampires or Psi-vampires (a.k.a. Psychic vampires) who drain people of energy rather than blood even though blood does play a little part as this kind of vampire showed up in movies like ""Lifeforce"", ""Sleepwalkers"" and some other ones. They are creature usually found in Asian to Japanese mythology but a few in European vampire legends besides the more common bloodsucking sunburning kind as these Psi-vampires can walk in the daylight and cast reflections.

The performances are very good and the film is loaded with action including a unique way of killing a Psi-vampire instead of the old way. Miss Munro is quite sexy here as usual, the film even paved the way for modern vampire hunter movies like the Vampire Hunter D series to Blade to even Van Helsing and most importantly the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer. I highly recommend this movie, it's one of my favorite vampire movies of all time.

This DVD does have a good widescreen transfer with the only extras being an audio commentary.",1275868800,3,1811,4.854368932038835
1192404,4,B000006584,"I've only seen a couple of Hammer horror films, but I'm impressed. They seem to be subtly effective if you're looking for a few thrills and chills, not overdoing the gore, being mild on the language but yet having a definite edge to them.

""Captain Kronos"" isn't super but it's enjoyable. The direction is excellent, the DVD transfer looked nice, and - like a good mystery - there's a good twist at the end regarding the murderer, er.....vampire. For us guys, there are also a lot of pretty women in here, too. The acting isn't the best but who cares? It's entertaining, and not made to be taken seriously.

I enjoyed the team of ""Captain Kronos and Professor Hieronymous-Grost,"" and I'm surprised there wasn't a sequel. These two guys make a good team: Horst Janson as the younger, dashing swordsman, and John Cater as the older assistant. The latter provides a little comic relief, too. Their relationship reminded me a bit of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce at ""Holmes and Watson.""

The good captain is not your normal vampire hunter. He's just as anxious to get it on with the ladies, and he has a sexy one for a partner in Caroline Munro as ""Carla."" Kronos also smokes ""herbal"" cigars! The brief touches of comedy, western, swashbuckling, horror, mystery, romance, sex, supernatural, and who-knows-what else all make it an inventive and fun hour-and-a-half. Hey, it even gives God several good plugs! This horror movie is different, all right.",1226448000,2,1447,4.826612903225806
1192405,5,B000006584,"By 1974 Hammer Films was in its death throes, its films had become formulaic--boring and predicatable. Their vampire films in particular were suffering from severe anemia despite copious amounts of blood being spilled, and not even the savage, arrogant charisma of Christoper Lee seemed capable of rescuing the Dracula films from certain death at the box office. It was at this point that Hammer finally decided to change its approach. Toward this end they hired Brian Clemens, best known for his work on television's AVENGERS, to ""revamp"" the genre. The film he created was CAPTAIN KRONOS VAMPIRE HUNTER, possibly the freshest, most creative vampire film to ever grace the genre. It completely re-thought the entire concept of the vampire, taking him out of the drawing room that Bela Lugosi had been limited to and away from the image of the revenge seeking, magnetic animal Christopher Lee frequently portrayed. His vampires (for this film was to have been the FIRST of a series of films) would be of many types, almost as if they were each of a different species. They would each ""live"" in a different manner, survive by taking different things from their victims, be detected in different ways, and be destroyed by totally different means as well. How cool is that?! In addition to having a good old fashioned monster movie of sorts we are also given a new type of monster movie that includes a mystery to be unraveled.

CAPTAIN KRONOS begins with the arrival of our titular hero (portrayed by Horst Jansen)who sports a Japanese katana,and his hunchbacked assistant/mentor Professor Hieronymos Grost (John Cater). They are seeking the village of Durward having been summoned by Kronos' old friend Dr. Marcus after some very strange deaths occurred in the village. Along the way they encounter the luscious Carla (Caroline Munro), a naughty gypsy girl whom Kronos frees from the stocks. Her crime? Dancing on Sunday. Of course she joins them, which is handy since they will need her for vampire bait later in the story. Marcus quickly fills our intrepid duo of vampire hunters in on the killer's modus operandi; it seems that young girls have suddenly been drained of their youth and left to die of old age, with only the slightest trace of blood upon their lips! This is a killer who seems to have no respect either for crosses or, as we soon learn, churchs themselves since one of the next girls meets her doom within the supposed safety of a church's walls. There are still more deaths as Kronos and Grost lay traps devised from Grost's knowledge of ancient folklore in an effort to determine the vampire's identity. Since this vampire steals youth itself from its victims rather than blood, they must seek out someone who has a ""cheek with a bloom on it"".

CAPTAIN KRONOS is one of the few 34 year old films that plays as well today as it did when it was initially released. One reason was the addition of the swordplay scenes which were choreographed by William Hobbs who also choreographed the 1974 Richard Lester version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS. The fight between Hobbs and Jansen pitted katana against a fencing foil and had a wonderfully, messy, realistic look to the action. The use of the katana was no doubt intended to capitalize on the new-found popularity of Asian martial arts films in the west. Hammers' own co-production with Shaw Brothers THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN VAMPIRES was released in 1974 as well. Another reason was the film's absolute break from the traditional Hammer/Hollywood vamps whose vampire ""lore"" had been established primarily by Bram Stoker in his novel and which had been taken as gospel ever since. Instead Clemens has given us something unique and completely original. This is a vampire film based on folklore rather than a Victorian novel, some of the lore is real some of it ""reel"". The influences of its ground breaking storyline can still be seen today in BLADE and BUFFY and their ilk where for better or worse vampires and their eternal foes have evolved into the 21st century and perhaps fallen into their own brand new cliches. While we may occasionally long for a good old fashioned Victorian romp a la Cushing and Lee, I still live for the day that I might walk into a movie and see something as stunningly original as CAPTAIN KRONOS was in 1974.

This film unfortunately failed upon its initial release for reasons I can't fathom. Its recent release on dvd seems to have enabled it to finally have found its audience however, and its about time. But its far too late to do us any good. There will never be a series of CAPTAIN KRONOS films as Brian Clemens had intended, and all I can say is what a loss. If you haven't seen it, pick up a copy and give it a chance. The photography and sets are excellent and the film simply oozes vintage Hammer in that respect. The actors are all at their peak--Jansen, who looks like a taller, blonder Roman Polanski, was dubbed even though his English was supposedly more than acceptable--I defy you to notice the dub job. There is virtually no violence, the ""killing blow"" is delivered via a kiss, and even less gore. But there are a great many wonderful touches that more than compensate for this. And best of all the script and direction by Brian Clemens couldn't be better--with THE AVENGERS on one's resume, what would you expect?

1192409,5,B000006584,"Not a ""cookie cutter"" traditional vampire movie. Blood is not the essence of the ""undead's"" existence, but rather draining youth from the young. Alternate ways on destroying vampires are explored. While viewing this film, I was struck by two themes. Firstly, the universal quest that addresses what beauty and ugliness are. Professor Heroemus Grost exemplifies this by saying, ""Am I so terribly ugly to provoke such mockery, am I? And the beautiful Caroline Munro counters with, ""Beauty fades eventually, but a kind soul remains forever, my mother taught me that."" Is perhaps an evil of our time the value of 'veneer' rather than cultivation of universal tolerance and a 'good heart'?

The second appealing theme was the embodiment of heroism in the character of Kronos. His quest for destroying the evil of oppressing the weak by the powerful such as ""stealing of youth from the young"" (on a humorous note, is this why our youth create a style so ""off beat"", so as not to be copied or ""stolen by the old""). Kronos is kind and gentle yet a skilled Samurai swordsman against the powers of darkness. The characters are rich, the story line thought provoking and direction by Brian Clements superb. Truly a quality ""off beat"" Hammer creation that will stand the test of time.

1192410,4,B000006584,"1974's ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" stands out among its era's many formula horror flicks in having a creative and distinctive twist on the vampire legend.

The vampire preying on a small European village seems to feast on young women, draining them of their youth as well as their blood.  The villagers summon help in the form of the rather Captain Kronos, an ex-soldier turned vampire hunter, and Professor Grost, a hump-backed source of vampire-killing weapons and humor.  An attractive peasant girl hitches a ride with them into town.  There, they face suspicious and superstitious villagers, a haughty and mysterious lord of the manor, and the vampire itself.

The movie seems to have been short money for special effects, but Director Brian Clemons gets a lot of suspense out of some very effective camera work.  The sword-wielding Captain Kronos is clearly an ancestor of the Wesley Snipes character in ""Blade""; Horst Janson plays him as a man with a mission and his own secrets.  Professor Grost provides the necessary commentary for the taciturn Kronos.  Caroline Munro is the peasant attracted and repelled by Kronos, and who will play a vital role in the resolution of the village's mystery.

1192412,5,B000006584,"Hammer Horror spent years churning out vampire flicks, but ironically they did their best shortly before the studio died. ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" was supposed to be the first in a series of gritty, action-packed movies, but it was a box-office flop.

Too bad, because ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" is actually one of Hammer's best movies, and one of the most unique vampire movies ever made. It's the very definition of a cult hit -- not many people know about it, but it was ahead of its time and is still fresh and enjoyable. (And I defy anyone to think that Stephen Sommers was not influenced...)

Mysterious ex-soldier Captain Kronos (Horst Janson) and hunchbacked professor Gorst (John Carson) arrive in a small English village, where young ladies are being aged into crones. Gorst suspects that a vampire smooched away each girl's youth, to regain eternal life for itself.

 The vampire hunters -- and a pretty gypsy girl (Caroline Munro) go about finding the vampire. But they soon discover that the villagers are getting antsy, a friend is infected with vampirism, and all clues point to the icy children of the aged Lady Durward. To lure out the vampire, Kronos must set a lethal trap...

""Captain Kronos"" was a departure for the vampire crowd. No sexy counts, Gothic castles, or elegant Peter Cushing characters. Instead we get a swashbuckling, pot-smoking hero in the midst of a slightly grimy English countryside. And he didn't pick that katana up at a secondhand store!

That grittiness is half the movie's appeal. But it also has a lot of creepy, great moments like flowers withering as a vampire walks past, or the repeated attempts to kill a character who is turning into a vampire. That last one is almost comic, as our long-suffering heroes try to do the guy in.

It's also cleverer than the usual vampire-hunter movie. It's strewn with red herrings, and a surprise ending when the vampire's identity is finally revealed. The dialogue can be quite cheesy (""What he doesn't know about vampires, you couldn't put in a flea's codpiece!""), but it's intentionally cheesy.

Janson has a presence a lot like Viggo Mortensen's -- sinewy, quiet and watchful. Since Kronos can survive vampire bite, seduce gypsies, and cut down a dozen villagers, it's a credit to Janson that we can actually like this apparently perfect guy. But Carson steals the show as the hunchbacked professor, who knows virtually everything there is to know about vampires.

In fact, Carson provides the movie with a bit of enlightened pathos that not many horror/action flicks have. Not once is he used for comic relief. And after his deformity is mocked (Kronos chops up the jokers), he sadly questions whether he is ugly. Carla and Kronos' responses show that they are real friends, not just travelling companions.

This cult movie is mainly known to vampophiliacs and Hammer fans, but it deserves to be noticed by anyone looking for a good supernatural swashbuckler. Solid and chilling, a great horror/action flick.",1150934400,11,3012,4.970178926441352

1192417,4,B000006584,"I bought the DVD after watching it from a taped showing on TV. I had taped it to watch later and had low expectations from its schlocky title and release date. On watching it, I had the pleasant surprise of seeing something far beyond my expectations. Shame on my Avenger fandom for not recognizing Brian Clemens name on it. CK/VH has many quirky details put into it that a talented director can do rather than just ordering something up from the CGI wizards. Creative camera angles, sets, and dialog make this a fine film.

The story is imaginative, yet tantalizing due to its subtle clues about the background of Kronos. If the film had been made ten years earlier or ten years later, it probably would have continued in a series for several more episodes. It just happened to be caught in a downtime period in the film industry. Too bad. Too bloody, bloody bad. Listening to the director's commentary makes one all too aware of an opportunity lost and never to be regained. Clemens seems to be very much responsible for the concept of his characters, which is one of the most charming aspects of the movie. The relationship between Kronos and Professor Grost is touching and well-written. Caroline Munro is more developed (in more ways than one, ahthankya!) than most Hammer females and has some of the best lines in the movie.

One regrets the budget constraints despite the creativity of cast and crew. I would love to have seen what could have been done with a bit more money. Not to mention continuing it into the type of series Clemens envisioned. Seeing it so many years after its release, I found it influential toward Vampire Hunter D (the second film especially). Kronos is mysteriously part vampire it seems, somewhat like D. Also look at the daughter of the vampires in Kronos and see how much she resembles the female bounty hunter in the D movie. They seem to be the only two women in the world with that hairstyle!

Part vampire horror movie, part supernatural detective story, and part sword-slashing adventure movie.  Set in England in - what would it be? 1800s or 1700s maybe - in a lush, gorgeous forest with small homesteads and winding wagon roads nestled amongst the greenery and bubbling brooks with great production design and photography, the movie pits professional evil-doer fighter Kronos and his allies against a new breed of vampire preying on the local villagers.  With Horst Janson displaying solid screen prescence as Kronos, the scorchingly hot Caroline Munro as the vivacious, big-hearted (and occasionally naked) lead damsel, and John Cater brilliant as Kronos's kindly, learned, hunchbacked sidekick/mentor, not to mention a small bushel of lovely village girls filling out both their roles and their costumes admirably.  A vampire picture with great crossover appeal, and fellow horror fans, don't pass this one up just because of its low blood factor.  This is an original, classy gem in a unique style; I wish a round of sequels had followed, perhaps with the protagonists battling unorthodox mummies, werewolves or some other horror staple.  One of the best vampire movies.",1099353600,6,1439,5.345132743362832
1192419,4,B000006584,"It's hard to make vampire movies fresh - that said - any vampire movie that plays with the traditional myths and still manages to carry a somewhat interesting plot deserves some props.  Kronos is one of those movies.  The film also demonstrates once again how well Hammer studios uses trick shots, lighting and natural scenery to establish the sense of foreboding doom and peril.
If you're interested in starting a collection of vampire movies, and you already have Dracula, Horror of Dracula, The Fearless Vampire Killers, The Hunger, Near Dark, and the Frank Langella version of Dracula with Laurence Olivier...you might as well go ahead and buy this one too.",1081814400,5,661,5.0
1192420,4,B000006584,"Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974) aka Kronos is one of the better films to come from Hammer Studios in the 70's.  It's basically a horror movie with a heaping helping of adventure thrown in and just a whole lot of fun.

Written and directed by Brian Clemens, the film stars German actor Horst Janson as Captain Kronos, a master of the sword and ex-solider, a freelance vampire killer, accompanied by the hunchbacked Professor Hieronymos Grost (John Cater), an authority on vampirism and good friend to Kronos.  The film also stars the lovely and infinitely easy on the eyes Caroline Munro who appeared in others films like Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974), and The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).

The film wastes no time on the horror aspect as we witness a young, comely woman in the woods attacked by a mysterious, cloaked stranger.  The once young woman is now old and withered, due to having her youth literally drained from her person.  A couple more attacks occur within the small English village, and this prompts Dr. Marcus (John Carson), the local physician, to contact his old friend, Captain Kronos.  On the way to the village, Kronos and Grost meet Carla (Monroe), an errant peasant girl, whom they allow to tag along, probably because she's so hot.  On arriving in the small village, Grost utilizes a unique vampire detection device to try and track the vile creature terrorizing the village, while Kronos has mad monkey love with Carla and rests for the upcoming battle.  Meanwhile, the village loses a couple more young women, decreasing the overall population greatly as I didn't see a whole lot of townsfolk to begin with...The hunt is on as Kronos and Grost search for clues as to the identity and location of the vampire.  Dr. Marcus may already have the answer to the mystery, but is not forthcoming due to personal reasons.  Also, forces have begun to conspire against Kronos and his group, and our hero seems to be threatened from a number of sides.  What drives the man to do what he does?  His motivations are spelled out later in the film, and while pretty simple, they satisfy nicely.  Will Captain Kronos discover the identity of the evil that plagues the village before he succumbs to it himself?  What secret does Dr. Marcus harbor?  Do we get to see Caroline Munro in the raw?  Watch the movie and find out...

I really enjoyed a number of elements within this film.  The notion that there are actually different types of vampires, and different methods of dispatch for each was a nice touch.  Also, Janson really provided a wonderful performance as the sort of swashbuckling hero, one with no fear, and an eagerness to perform his self define task of ridding the lands of the scourge of vampirism.  I also liked that his friend and maybe even mentor, the hunchbacked Professor Grost was actually presented as a highly intelligent individual, capable of assisting his friend in their exploits with the undead.  The swordplay within the movie was a whole lot of fun, but I was a bit perplexed with scenes where Kronos would jam his swords into the ground, or use them to dig in the dirt.  I know little of swords, but I would have thought a master swordsman would take more care with his weapons, not using them in such fashion for fear of dulling or nicking the blades.  Oh well, a minor nuance that struck me as strange.  The whole mystery element as to who is the vampire is played for all it's worth, and there are obtuse clues sprinkled throughout the story that may help the viewer uncover this on their own.

The print provided by Paramount looks excellent and there is a commentary track available including genre historian Jonathan Sothcott, filmmaker Brian Clemens and actress Caroline Munro.  Kronos is swashbuckling action, Hammer style, and well worth looking into whether you're a fan of horror, action, or both.

You would expect this to be terrible because of the lack of Hammer regulars like Lee or Cushing but I must admit that this movie holds it's own with a set of no-names, probably due to a well written script and decent direction. The characters remind you of Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" pictures with bad guys who light matches on the backs of hunchbacks, etc. Here we have the usual set of nasty barroom boys who try to start fights with every newcomer and they meet their match after...what else?... insulting a hunchback and losing 3 to 1 odds against Captain Kronos and his swordplay. Similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this movie could have been a prototype for the future ""Scooby crew"". Unusual and somewhat entertaining.

1192423,1,B000006584,"Alright, normally I love a good B-movie but this dosen't even rate that high. Captain Kronos is a lame attempt at a vampire tale. It ignores most of the traditional rules which you will either love or hate and is pitifully acted. The first 1/3 of the movie is all set up and exposition with no pay off at the end. Most of the movie consists of Kronos flashing a colgate smile and giving lines to his new found girlfriend that even Austin Powers would find chessy. The rest of it are scenes of young girls who suddenly have a black robbed figure appear out of no where while on a frollick some where or another and have their youth drained away. The climax if you can call it that is as about as scary as robin hood men in tights without the humor.

1192424,5,B000006584,"With so much hype now surrounding this as one of Hammer's best efforts from the 1970's I was expecting something special. And I got it! Although obviously done on an even smaller budget than most Hammer films, the limited production value didn't detract from a first rate story and script. Producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell have managed to establish their own style at a time when Hammer was more concerned with T&A than plot. CK neatly avoids this syndrome. The movie focuses firmly on the story and wonderful action sequences. After the film ended I felt a little sad, for two reasons: 1). That more Captain Kronos films or even a television series didn't materialise and 2). That Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell didn't produce more films for Hammer, because arguably their ""Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde"" and ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" were two of the finest productions to come out of England's House of Horror. Munro/Clemens/Sothcott provide an entertaining and informative commentary. Interesting fact: Clemens originally wanted Kronos to sleep in a Golden Coffin , but budget restraints curtailed this groovy idea. I've a nagging notion, that we may have eventually found out that Kronos was indeed a type of vampire himself. Paramount provides a solid anamorphic transfer, with few blemishes ot dirt. They really should be praised for putting so much effort into what is still an obscure film from England.",1072569600,6,1427,5.102564102564102
1192425,4,B000006584,"First of all this is one of the better of Hammer's later films and features good performances by the dashing Horst Jansen and the radiant Caroline Munro.  As the film itself has already been reviewed extensively this review will focus on the quality of the DVD release.
  First of all ""Captain Kronos"" has been given a very nice, but not exceptional transfer.  The contrast and picture are fine and the colors are decent for a 1972 production.  The sound mix is largely confined to the center channel, but dialogue is clear and easily understandable.  The picture has been letterboxed at 1:85:1 and is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen tv's (This may explain why the reviewer from Richmond, Va was getting a full-screen picture, assuming he is using an Apex DVD player, the early models can't handle anamorphic enhancements and will blow up a 1:85:1 DVD formatted for 16:9 to fill the screen.)  Paramount notes this item, the 16:9 enhancement, under ""special features"".  I don't consider that, nor the dolby encoded soundtrack, nor the English subtitles (the film has not been closed captioned) as ""special features"" or extras.  These are now standard features on DVD releases.  The only extra is a running commentary by the Director Brian Clemens, actress Caroline Munro and a film historian.  I guess for Paramount that makes this a ""special editon"", however the films trailer (which should also be a standard feature on a 2003 DVD release) is missing.  In fairness, it should be noted that the trailer may no longer exist.  However, a short featurette on the making of the film, some TV spots, even just a few pages of text with bios on the cast and crew would have rounded out this release better.  Overall the Film gets an A-, Video quality gets a B+, Audio quality gets a B, Extras, or the lack thereof, gets a C.",1070409600,6,1824,4.80448717948718
1192426,3,B000006584,"I first ran across this film in the mid-80's when I was rediscovering Hammer films. It is probably the most unique of the gothic horror films that Hammer is known for, being both a swashbuckler and a vampire flick. The film was great, nice crisp colors, and great sound. This should make it a 5-star review, right? NO!
The top banner of the keepcase says ""Widescreen Collection"". I was prepared to watch one of my favorite Hammer films in letterbox glory. It only plays as a fullscreen (1.33:1 aspect ratio). I will be returning mine to Wal-mart for a refund.",1067558400,3,559,4.6
1192427,4,B000006584,"One of Hammer's last great horror films (the confused To The Devil, A Daughter has its moments but it was compromised from the very beginning), Captain Kronos is receiving the deluxe treatment compared to some of the other Paramount releases on DVD. The transfer is good although there are some issues related to edge enchancement that haven't been resolved here during the transfer. The colors are pretty vivid overall and, while the print isn't pristine, it looks worlds better than many of the other releases from the same time frame.
The sound is standard mono. There isn't any attempt to remix the sound for 5.1 Dolby but it does sound better than the VHS version I had (although it does sound a bit flat and, pardon the pun, lifeless in a couple of spots).
In the hands of veteran director Brian Clemens, Kronos couldn't possibly have gone wrong. One of the major issues that dogged Hammer towards the end of its short reign was the inability to attract top outside talent. There were exceptions to be sure, but Hammer survived at the end by producing meagerly budgeted films lacking in the talent necessary to pull it off. Happily, Kronos was an exception to this rule.
Clemens, a veteran of The Avengers (among many others)directs with a stylish flourish that provides much needed energy throughout most of the film. The result is a film that, despite its shortcomings (budget being the chief complaint), still manages to dazzle. It's a pity that there was no way to introduce Peter Cushing's Van Helsing into this mix as a way to pass the baton to others as it would have been a nice touch.
The Vampires here don't drink blood but, instead, drain the life force of youth from their victims. A fascintating premise and update of the traditional vampire legend. Kronos jumps to the rescue attempting to stop this plague of vampires from continuing to take more victims. Clemens' retake on this old legend helps to prevent Kronos from becoming predictable. It's clear that Clemens (and Hammer) had hopes that the film would inspire a series of films. Sadly, this wasn't to be.
The DVD has a commentary by Hammer historian Jonathan Sothcott with interesting observations provided by director Brian Clemens and actress Caroline Munro. This is an example of how Warner Brothers, Columbia and, yes, even Paramount should have treated their other Hammer releases.",1066521600,5,2364,4.883084577114428

1192429,5,B000006584,"Not a ""cookie cutter"" traditional vampire movie. Blood is not the essence of the ""undead's"" existence, but rather draining youth from the young. Alternate ways on destroying vampires are explored. While viewing this film, I was struck by two themes. Firstly, the universal quest that addresses what beauty and ugliness are. Professor Heroemus Grost exemplies this by saying, ""Am I so terribly ugly to provoke such mockery, am I ?, and the beautiful Caroline Munro counters with, ""Beauty fades eventually, but a kind soul remains forever, my mother taught me that."" Is perhaps an evil of our time the value of 'veneer' rather than cultivation of universal tolernace and a 'good heart'?

The second most appealing theme was the embodiment of heroism in the character of Kronos. His quest for destroying the evil of oppressing the weak by the powerful such as ""stealing of youth from the young"" (on a humorous note, is this why our youth  create a style so ""off beat"", so as not to be copied or ""stolen by the old""). Kronos is kind and gentle yet a skilled Samurai swordsman against the powers of darkness. The characters are rich, the story line thought provoking and direction by Brian Clements superb. Truly a quality ""off beat"" Hammer creation that will stand the test of time. Frank Austan, LRCP, M.Sc.",1018137600,3,1304,4.86936936936937
1192430,4,B000006584,"This is certainly one of the most unorthodox and best of the Hammer films.  While the title screams ""cheese,"" it is in fact a well-plotted, confidently-directed film that was well ahead of its time (in light of the subsequent appearance of such films as ""Vampire Hunter D"" and ""Blade"").  It is also refreshingly low-key, making the most of atmosphere and an unusual premise, rather than cheap shocks. It may not be gory, and some of the effects certainly expose its low budget origins, but the sheer inventiveness of the film makes it worth seeking out.  It's the little touches that make the film great, from the inspired score to the novel twists on vampire lore.  And of course the unmistakable colors and sights of Hammer films. ""Kronos"" also stands up nicely to repeat viewings, something that can't be said for a lot of horror films.  I suspect that the solidness of the character-- part Sabatini hero, part Peckinpah anti-hero-- has something to do with that.  It's a shame that a sequel never materialised, but then again that means that we're spared the agony of seeing a brilliant character reduced to a one-liner spouting fast food tie-in.",978912000,28,1150,4.841836734693878

And the obligatory luscious females are of the  highest standard in the shape of Miss Munro and, especially for me anyway,  Wanda Ventham. The general atmosphere is up to the usual Hammer standards.  There is one scene in particular, involving the killing of a vampire at his  own behest, which is to my mind one of the most darkly comic in all the  genre.

Brian Clemens of the Avengers on TV fame is the creator and director. He does a fine job here with the direction and writing, but while watching I feel Terence Fisher or Roy Ward Baker would have done a little more with it in the directing.
As part of the Hammer stars who are in it this one has Shane Briant and Caroline Munroe as the only really recognizable actors from previous Hammer Horror. They do fine in their roles which are under written unfortunately.
Wanda Ventham makes a guest appearance and if you follow her career you know she is something of a British cult figure. Ian Hendry a famous actor of 60s TV is also on hand in a cameo. John Carson a very reliable character actor steals the movie . He is worth the viewing in this film as he really does a nice turn in this cult film.
