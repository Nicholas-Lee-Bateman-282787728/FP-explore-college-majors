8252463,3,B0013OD8IS,"It's a good DVD for learning the range and philosophy of NIA exercise. But I understand myself to prefer a structured approach (for example: a dvd with three modules - one for upper body, one for lower body, one for core). While this was pleasing to watch, I really couldn't get into allowing myself to exercise this way.  Back to my structured DVD collection, and long bike rides in any weather.",1322179200,,396,4.577464788732394
8252464,5,B0013OD8IS,"Very interesting.  The fact that so many people ""hate to exercise"" even though it can make a person feel SO good, shows that instruction like that offered in this video are necessary.  Help us change how we experinece what we feel as we ""work out"", and thus change how we work out to create something better.

Note this is NOT an exercise video- nowhere in the description does it claim to be, but at least one reviewer mistook it to be so and unfairly rated it poorly based on her own failure to read the description.

Enjoy!",1266019200,3,526,4.391752577319588
8252465,1,B0013OD8IS,"I purchased this video thinking it was a Nia workout. If that is what your looking for, this video is probably going to disappoint you. It's a video of a conference with an instructor up front telling you about different things - good information just not a workout.",1240185600,27,266,4.5625
