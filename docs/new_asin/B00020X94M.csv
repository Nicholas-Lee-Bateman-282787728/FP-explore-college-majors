My only dislike was the varying sound quality, and sometimes the camera angle was a bit awkward.  The Jennifer Knits sections were consistantly good, and the trip to the Alpaca farm and the fiber processing were really interesting.",1086998400,13,452,4.857142857142857
2053994,5,B00020X94M,"There's so much great stuff in this DVD. If you are a beginning knitter, this is like having a private instructor in your living room; you can learn at your own pace. If you are intermediate, you can sharpen your skills with techniques that will tempt you to try other fun projects, beyond scarves. And advanced/all knitters, there's an interesting color theory section, a fit-to-knit workshop to keep your muscles in condition, a demo on wire knitting, a very informative ""fiber care"" lesson, lot's of fashion inspiration and fun stuff to watch (the alpaca sheering is SO cute!). I love how easy it is to get to whatever subject you're looking for, with the interactive INDEX. Oh - and the knit circles in CA and NY are a stitch!
The perfect gift for wanna-be-to-expert knitters.",1085443200,22,780,4.785185185185185
2053995,1,B00020X94M,This DVD is horrible. I guess the instruction is good but I have no way of knowing for certain because the production is so shoddy. You can barely hear the two women talking and the cameras are jerking around the entire time. Those closeup shots almost made me motion sick.,1140307200,10,273,4.48
2053996,2,B00020X94M,"The information contained in this DVD is good overall; however the production is terrible, at times it has the sound quality of a porno-very distracting, and unpleasant. The menu is also cumbersome. There are better choices for the beginner.",1139788800,8,241,5.205128205128205
2053997,5,B00020X94M,"Some of the women in my office get together and knit and they were having such a blast, I wanted to give it a shot. A couple of them recommended The Art of Knitting DVD, so I bought it and within a couple of viewings, I was on my way to making a cool scarf.

The knitting demos are clear and the resource guide lists shops and books and other great info.

There's also a volume 2, available on The Art of Knitting website and I'm gonna get that one, because it's got crochet demos. I want to learn granny squares and make my mom a throw for Mother's Day.

So buy this. You'll be amazed at how fast you'll be up and knitting. C'mon guys...give it shot.",1139356800,4,651,4.0703125
2053998,3,B00020X94M,"Overall I liked the DVD HOWEVER, I could have done without the ""Knitting Zen"" and ""Music to Knit By"" sections.  It would have been helpful for me to see more repetitions of actual knitting stitches.  I'm not sorry I purchased it but....it could have been better.",1139356800,4,262,4.673913043478261
2053999,5,B00020X94M,"THE ART OF KNITTING  and it's Volume 2 THE ART OF KNTTING AND CROCHET we're a stellar way for me to brush up on my knitting skills from years ago and complete some wonderful projects for my family this past Christmas.

When I started the DVD I could barely Purl, by the end of the first DVD I had knitted a hat and scarf, by the end of the 2nd DVD I had knitted my son a pair of socks.

These DVDs are more than an instructional DVD - they're more like an encyclopedia of knitting with lots of little fun stories on how yard in made and different types of Yarn, how colors work together and stuff like that.

The DVD is cleverly organized alphabetically so you just click on a section of the index with your remote and you're right there.

I'm 66  years old and haven't knitted in 20 years - this was the perfect way to brush up without reading a bunch of books. I love my DVD player anyway and knitting in the living room alows me to be sociable with my family.

I've passed The Art Of Knitting on to my daughter and she loves it as well.",1137456000,4,1039,4.063725490196078
2054000,1,B00020X94M,"For Christmas I wanted to get my wife some videos on how to knit. She's always said she wanted to get better. I purchased this video in a Amazon pair with Loriknits: Beyond Purl.

My wife watched this video last night. I'm not a knitter so my review is based on my wife's comments (she's not a computer person so she's never do this herself).

The video is broken into several segments the first two are instructional and the rest basically fluff.

The first two segments are instructional. Each runs about 10 minutes long. The first looked like they setup a camera in the teacher's basement. The sound was not clear and video quality was what I'd expect from a home video. The instruction was ok but even I could see it was very basic. The second segment was better good sound quality and clear video. Again it was a very basic instruction and a rehash of the material from the first segment.  This was the best segment of the video. If this teacher did a full DVD it would probably be a worthwhile purchase.

The rest of this video is filled with topics like learning how to yard is dyed, start a knitting group, the ZEN of knitting. This material is not instructional at all. It's the kind of material I'd expect to find in a documentary about the knitting community. It's not what I'd expect from a DVD on ""how to knit"".

My wife was very disappointed with this purchase and I'm disappointed that she was unable to enjoy her Christmas gift.

She's going to watch Beyond Purl this weekend. I hope that goes better.",1135987200,9,1517,4.4548736462093865
2054001,5,B00020X94M,"I've found this DVD a great introduction to the knitting world.  Aside from clearly explaining the basic fundamentals of knitting it brings you into the world of knit fashion, inspiring you to implement your skills and create your own designs.

2054002,1,B00020X94M,"The background music for much of the DVD is not in the background.  It is like getting knitting instructions while standing in front of a speaker at a concert.  The music totally drowns out the speaking, which is muddy and sounds like they had the microphone in the bathroom down the hall from where they were giving the instructions.

The instructors are a bit boring, but as I said, I could not understand a thing they said.  We skipped thru most of the sections hoping it would get better.  Then repacked it and returned it the same day.",1134345600,8,540,4.469387755102041

2054004,5,B00020X94M,This is a FANTASTIC DVD!!! I am a working mom and I knit and crochet when my kids go to bed. It's just like having a teacher in my living room. On the DVD there are stitch alongs and one is just for socks!!  The way they teach you how to turn the heel is exceptional!! My 8 year old daughter now KNITS!! LOVE THE DVD!! I recommend every sock knitter to have in their library!,1131580800,4,375,3.9342105263157894
2054005,3,B00020X94M,"I wanted to learn to knit and thought this DVD would be a great starting place. It wasn't. The sound quality goes in and out, the instructors are very boring and the closeup camera shots superimposed in a corner of the screen while the instructor talks aren't really all that close up! I've tried to sit through this 3 times and I'm determined to learn something from it! There is some good info, but this DVD was very disappointing. BETTER BET: Learn to Knit with Laura Jean also available at Amazon. For a beginning knitter Laura Jean's DVD is EXCELLENT, fun, great sound and closeups.",1124668800,8,587,4.6
2054006,2,B00020X94M,"I am a ""advanced beginning"" knitter, I know the stitches, cast-on, decreases, increases, etc and this video confused the heck out of me! The knitting demo is out of focus at times, you can barely hear the instructor (but you can clearly hear someone tell the camera man to turn on the stabilizer - a good idea), and it just looks like they tried to use every effect that their home-editing program had. The music is annoying and often gets in the way of hearing what the people are saying.

The stitch gallery is very cool, although some of the stitches shown are really complicated and the video doesn't really show you how to do any of them besides the basics.

I did enjoy the whole part about describing all of the different yarns (synthetic, plant, animal, etc) and their behavior. Skip the designer section, it is unispired at best.

I think that for people who have never knit before, the book ""Stitch n Bitch"" is much more useful for showing you the ropes, so to speak. If you really want to try this DVD, get it at the library, save yourself the $20.",1123718400,9,1059,4.448453608247423
2054007,2,B00020X94M,"I'm sad to say that this DVD was a disappointment.  I appreciate the efforts the girls on the dvd made, but it just didn't get there.  The camera angles were poor and I couldn't see what the teacher was doing.

A friend gave me this dvd as a gift because I've been wanting to learn how to knit for a long time.  There is so much on this dvd that I don't need, so much clutter that it was confusing just to navigate it.  I feel bad for the people who made it, but I have to let other potential buyers know what a low quality product I think they're getting.

Sorry, but I don't recomment this dvd....",1122768000,15,599,4.033898305084746
2054008,3,B00020X94M,"I thought the instruction for actual knitting was very well done, but there wasn't very much of it. It was interesting to learn about the different yarns, color and all that, but they spent way too much time on the extras, and not enough about actually knitting itself. The music to knit to was only 3 pieces. It was a joke to even have that on the DVD or to mention it. Buy a CD. I was disappointed, but I did still like it.",1122249600,6,425,4.071428571428571

I like the teacher,  Jennifer very much and think it's great how can I pause the DVD and even go in slow motion, so I can follow along. I think her section alone is worth the price.
I knew the very basics of knitting before I saw this DVD. Since buying it, I have learned enough to make me confident enough to start a sweater!
I was excited to learn from their website that there is now a Vol 2 that has crochet on it! Gonna have to buy that one, too.",1119484800,8,643,3.8636363636363638
2054010,5,B00020X94M,"Wow! is this ever the encyclopedia of knitting I was looking for. For anyone who knits, beginner, intermediate or advanced, this DVD is a must have. It's so full of knitting demonstrations ( which you can pause, repeat and slo-mo), patterns and tips it took me 2 days to go through it. It's like having my grandma  from back east, beside me - teachig me to knit.

My girlfriends and I have started a knit circle and we play the DVD. The website info on the back of the DVD (...) also says there's a volume 2 out which includes Crochet. THIS IS THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANYONE WHO ALREADY LOVES TO KNIT - OR ANYONE YOU WANT TO GET STARTED IN KNITTING.",1117843200,5,646,4.2439024390243905
2054011,3,B00020X94M,"I found the knitting instruction to be very difficult to see.  The camera jumped all over as the hands kept moving and didn't focus tightly enough for me to see what she was doing.  I recently bought a how to knit package at Target (included yarn and pattern and DVD) and they showed the knitting hands from all angles over and over and over again.  For someone like me, a brand new knitter who hadn't tried it before, the Art of Knitting doesn't show the hands well enough to follow.  Later on there's another section (the intermediate section) that is MUCH better with regards to camera not jumping around, but still not as well lit or miked so there was an echo.

I am going to look at the rest of the DVD but if there's only 35 minutes of actual knitting, then it's a big disappointment.",1113782400,7,791,4.35374149659864
2054012,5,B00020X94M,"Books are great, lessons are too, but nothing beats watching the mechanics of knitting to help you learn how to do it.

I think The Art of Knitting DVD is well worth the money, because of all of the interesting info on it, in addition to the lessons. I learned things about fiber and color theory that I never would have otherwise. Knowing all of things help enhance the knitting experience.

Yes, there are free sites on the net that show the stitches, but you can't freeze them or do them in slow-motion like you can with the DVD.

I learned how to knit from this DVD and couldn't be happier with it. I also signed up on their website: [...]

The 3hr 39min dvd has about 35 actual minutes of knitting instruction and 3hr 4min of babble about the artistic value, history of color, spiritual experience, and health benefits of knitting. The patterns it speaks of can be found for free on the internet and the actual instruction leaves a lot to be desired. I was very disappointed. I would encourage those interested to search the web for sites that offer free video clips of knitting. You will learn a lot more and it's free!",1107216000,,545,4.6875

The information in this video was very good for a novice and I also liked the Zen of Knitting and other extras.  As an Intermediate knitter, I would have liked to seen more along the lines of different stitches and techniques, but overall a good video.  The reason for 4 stars....the sound in the beginning is not very good.  I think that if the music was deleted while the teacher was teaching, it would be a bit better.

I took knitting lessons and couldn't wait to start making hats and scarves. I kept making mistakes and couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I couldn't keep taking lessons or going back to the store for help, so I decided to put ""knit DVD"" into Google and my problem was solved.

I found [...] and ordered The Art of Knitting. Lucky for me, they had a special and I got a free tote bag, too!

The lessons on the DVD are so clear and easy to understand and I've watched them over and over, so I could see exactly how the stitches are made. It's great being able to do that in slow motion, too.

The DVD is easy to navigate and has so much stuff on it, I still haven't seen everything. I'm still groovin' on the great demonstrations.

I've still got a lot to learn, but I am on my way, thanks to this wonderful and amazing DVD!",1104192000,19,913,4.135593220338983
2054016,5,B00020X94M,"This DVD is an easy way to learn a craft that has been in my family for many years.  Unfortunately most of my family is still back in Asia, so I had no one to teach me to knit.  I found this DVD on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I had no idea there was so much information on this DVD about knitting as well as great lessons on different parts of the craft.  Sometimes my English is not the best and I need people to repeat things for me.  That is no problem with this DVD, I could review the stitches over and over in slow motion until I learned the correct way to do them.

The Art Of Knitting DVD was also a lot of fun and gave me contacts and information on knitting, yarns, tools and places to get knitting things in my town.  Also, my friend lives in St. Louis and I was able to e-mail her information on a local knitting store recommended by the DVD.

The website (where you can also order it) [...] , says there will be more DVDs in the series soon.  I can't wait for the next DVD which includes a section on CROCHET!

The DVD is a couple of dollars more expensive on [...] but they give you a free knitting tote bag and offer a really cute knitting starter kit that is a great gift for new knitters.

In a knitting circle I just joined we watch the DVD for lessons and I have bought several copies for friends, as a gift.",1102982400,,1337,3.9700374531835205
2054017,5,B00020X94M,"My Grandmother taught me to knit, but I have to tell you, this DVD is the next best thing.  There is so much information and lessons packed into this hours long (it says 3 1/2 hours) DVD that it took me a full week to review all of the segments.

This DVD is fantastic!  The beginner section was a refresher for me as I hadn't knitted since I was 12 years old with my Grandmother.  In the Choose Your Style section I finally mastered the Continental knitting style, which now allows me to knit much quicker.  One of the best lessons for me was in the Intermediate section where I learned the skills to knit my first sweater.

The Art Of Knitting is inspiring.  I'm a backup singer and on the road a lot.  I just pop this DVD in my laptop at nights, pick up my needles and it relaxes me after a show.  I knit little things for my daughter.  It's far more personal than buying her some cheap junk in an airport, when I'm away from her.  Now my little girl wants to knit and I look forward to doing this with her.  She is 7 years old and can easily run a DVD remote.

Besides the lessons, the DVD has sections on yarns, color theory, knitting as a meditation, knitting events, a resource guide (which helps me find cute yarn stores while I'm traveling), a stitch library and music-to-knit-by (which I LOVE!).

This was the best 20 bucks I've spent in a long time.  It's a lot more than a DVD, it's a way to fill your life with creative activity while, at the same time making something special for the people in your life.",1102982400,20,1519,4.2076124567474045
2054018,5,B00020X94M,"I love this DVD!!

After not knitting for many years, I needed to relearn everything I'd forgotten and this DVD came along at the right time.

The knitting demos are great. I love how it easy it is to rewatch the segments and even do them in slow-motion, so you can really watch how the stitches are formed.

The A-Z index on the DVD is one of the best features on it. You can find any section you need in seconds. Beats all the fast-forwarding and rewinding you'd have to do with a tape. For example, I was working on a project that called for a cast-on increase and I never actually did that before. I went to ""C"" on the index, found ""cast-on increase"" clicked and there was my segment. It took faster to do it, than it did to just write it here! And for anyone who was ever confused as to how to fix a dropped stitch, the segment doing that saved me lots of frogging (that's a term for ripping out-for any non-knitters reading this).

This DVD is not just demos. There's over three hours of stuff on it. I especially liked the knitting circles and seeing how different the East and West Coast knitters are. It was so cute and funny! The chiropractor segment with exercises to prevent injuries while knitting is great for someone with bad posture like me. I also liked the wire knitting segment with Nancie Wiseman and plan to make the bracelet she shows.

The pattern for the bracelet along with a hat and bikini pattern are included on a printed leaflet with the DVD. I already made several hats for my DH with the pattern, even one with stripes, which I learned how to do with the DVD.

There is nothing else like this out there right now. I am a researcher, so I know!

It's a great price for so much information and entertainment. I recommend it highly!!",1102982400,15,1761,4.334346504559271

The DVD offers a lot for beginners like me, but also my wife found the stitch library, patterns and segment on color theory highly useful.  I would recommend this as a gift for couples to enjoy.

A week ago I never would have believed I would knit my own scarf for the New York winter!",1102982400,11,563,4.436893203883495
2054020,1,B00020X94M,"From the website I was expecting a much better put-together dvd. While the information was interesting, the video editing, dvd menus, and graphics were horrible. At one point, there was so much motion on the screen that I had to turn the tv off because I was getting motion sick.

I think that with a little effort, this dvd could have been wonderful. However, a LOT of the interviews were ""home-movie"" quality, the audio was poor, the video wasn't as crisp as it could have been, and the template style of the video editing (picture in picture boxes) was just amatuerish.

Add to that the dvd menu being poorly constructed and hard to navigate due to all the sub-menus and whatnot, and you can see how I was getting frustrated. In addition, the stitch library was a joke, with SCANS taken from sepia-colored books, and 3 songs total in the music to knit by section.

As a knitter myself, I understand that the selection for this type of product is slim. But, we can demand better!! We should demand better! Poor production quality, and bad design shouldn't be something we overlook just so we can get a dvd with a couple of interesting interviews and several redundant how-to knit interviews!!! I give the producers an A+ for effort because they obviously went to a lot of trouble with the interviews, but it could have been much better, and at $19.99 which is more than I usually pay for a box-office type of dvd, I was very dissatisfied.",1102636800,10,1440,4.595330739299611
2054021,3,B00020X94M,"This DVD, in parts, looked like it was filmed in somebody's basement.  The lighting is poor and looks very amateurish in parts.  It accomplished what it sets out to do, but without any style whatsoever.  It was very frustrating to watch the woman in the gold lame shirt and her fumbling attempts at learning how to knit alongside the more experienced knitter.  I, personally, could have done without all that.  My advice is to watch the experienced knitter's stitching, and forward through the novice's, as it is very confusing when you're learning to do something and you see someone doing it wrong.  It gets much better in the intermediate segment, when Jennifer of Jennifer Knits shows you increases and decreases.  They should have just let her do the entire video from start to finish, as the camera angles and closeups are much more helpful.",1102377600,6,847,4.840277777777778

I enjoyed the warm and fuzzy alpacas, and the freedom of wire crochet.  The twisted sisters - Jennifer - and the whole Zen of knitting idea were all new and informative.  I have been converted to continental knitting.  As an avid crocheter, just returning to knitting after 20+ plus years, I find the continental knit technique the best way to transition back.  Crocheters tend to use their left hands to guide their yarn, so this is the easiest way for us to knit.  I purl American however.  I would not have known about these options if it weren't for Jennifer.

The first five minutes paid for the effort. And I had no idea that it would go on for hours and hours. You need to have plenty of coffee ready and forget about doing any thing else the day you start to watch this DVD.

It is organized like an animated magazine with articles and sub-articles to those. Each is well titled and gives further reading or viewing references. Like a magazine not everyone will be interested in every section; yet you can always fine something and much is serendipity.

Not everything is physically knitting yet they go trough all types of knitting forms. There is a quick section on the difference in holding thread as in American vs. Continental. If you ever watch any Agatha Christy miss Marple movies with Joan Hickson then you get a good dose of Continental or European knitting methods.

Everyone knows that the process of knitting is just mechanical; you can do most while watching TV or holding a conversation. But what to knit, what looks good, and what works well as clothing, accessories or art is an other matter. We even get a crash course in color psychology.

If I covered everything on this DVD it would take a book. And this is just one of a series.

If you're thinking about buying a knitting dvd, The Art of Knitting is a great place to start...two thumbs way up, you'll totally love this dvd!",1159920000,2,477,4.348314606741573

8019910,5,B00020X94M,"The Art of Knitting was great for a beginner knitter like myself.  A few minutes after popping in the DVD I was on my way to knitting my first hat.  The Knitting Library was great for help w/ terms and abbreviations and the jazz selection  to knit by was wonderful.  This DVD is a great introduction to the world of knitting and has a ton of exciting projects for beginner and advanced knitters alike.  If you feel overwhelmed when looking at knit book instructions and illustrations then I would highly reccmmend this DVD because the knitting lessons with Jennifer makes you feel like you have your very own personal instructor.  There's so much on this DVD you just have to see it for yourself, I know you'll love it too! I can easily see why this is the #1 knitting DVD on the market. Go and buy it!",1158883200,3,802,4.385135135135135
8019911,5,B00020X94M,"This DVD exceeded my expectations and I can't say enough good things about it!!

First of all, the knitting lessons with Jennifer of Jennifer Knits, were fantastic! It made me understand the differences between American and Continental and I discovered I've been a Continental knitter all along.

What's great about this DVD is, you can repeat watching the lessons and it's like having a private tutor. It's much better than actually having one and asking them over and over again to repeat the stitches. I can imagine trying the patience of anyone doing that, but with the DVD you don't need to worry about this.

The stitches and techniques shown on The Art Of Knitting DVD are invaluable. I still consider myself a beginner and I just finished a simple sweater with the skills I learned on this DVD. It's so exciting!

Now that's just one part of this DVD. There's over 3-and-a-half hours of content. Among my faves are the stitch library, glossary of terms, spinning and dyeing demos and of course, the A-Z index lots of other reviewers here have mentioned. It's the coolest feature and something I have never seen on any other DVD.

There's a nice quote from Olivia Newton-John on the case of the DVD. In my own words, if I can parody one of her songs, ""Let's Get Knit-ical"" with The Art of Knitting DVD.",1153958400,,1309,4.64935064935065
8019912,5,B00020X94M,"I've been wanting to learn to knit for a while.

I found TheArtOfKnitting.com website and was so excited to see how much info was on the DVD.

I ordered it and after just a couple of viewings, made some cool scarves. The directions were clear and it's so great how you can rewatch the clips and really get a moving view of how knitting works. It still amazes me how looping yarn on needles can make such a beautiful fabric. More amazing is how easy it was learning with this awesome DVD.  Aside from the great instructions, my favorite feature of The Art of Knitting DVD is the A-Z index. When I need a little refresher, I can just go right to the section I need. There's so much more on this DVD (check out their website to see the full list of features), I know you'll just love it. I do!",1153699200,6,790,4.184210526315789
8019913,5,B00020X94M,"So I'm one of those people who's sick of nit picky knitters always showing off the great stuff they've knitted, so i asked my friend Jane 9 who's a real dufus -- how the hell she knitted that fabulous scarf and hat set - she told me THE ART OF KNITTING DVD. So I bought it on line from some place called Leisurearts.com (they deliver in a day or two) and put it on the dvd player put my feet up and started to watch. I had bought a couple of other knitting DVDs before and had given up in utter boredom and thrown them away. Not this time. Three hours later the fog had lifted and the whole mysterious world of knitting was revealed. This DVD is fantastic! I could actually follow the steps in slo motion and work out the stitches. There's so many neat features about knitting on this DVD it's more like a knitting encyclopedia than a 'how to'. This DVD even has an A-Z index! A handy timesaver that I've never seen on any other DVD of any kind. So then I gave THE ART OF KNITTING as a gift to a few friends and now we're all knitting to this DVD and swapping knit stories. One friend bought her daughter THE ART OF KNITTING AND CROCHET II the follow up DVD that also has crochet instruction, and she swears that it is just as good as THE ART OF KNITTING but with a whole load of new stuff. If you want to learn to knit GO NO FURTHER! This is the best DVD in the market place and DVD is the best way to learn knitting -- it's like having a teacher in your living room that you can turn off and on when you want to.",1149206400,8,1514,4.0
