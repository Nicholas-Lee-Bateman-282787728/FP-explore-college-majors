5389721,3,B00A6WXIT2,"It does have the essential movies that were only shown on PBS. The quality is what can be expected when transferring from tape to DVD, some episodes were better than others, however overall rather poor. I can only recommend it for hard core Shepherd fans. I'm surprised that PBS has never issued DVDs of the feature length movies, they're sitting on a goldmine!",1373328000,8,361,4.746031746031746
5389722,4,B00A6WXIT2,"The Jean Shepherd collection is a worthwhile purchase. You get all but two of the prequels/sequels of A Christmas Story (Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss and A Summer Story are not in the set), as well as monologues and appearances that Jean did throughout the years. The quality is, IMO, better than what the seller displays. I highly recommend this set, and the ""bonus gift"" was quite a surprise. Why try and hunt around for all of the movies, when you can get them all here in one set, for a very reasonable price?",1363478400,13,517,4.51063829787234
5389723,5,B00A6WXIT2,The quality of the videos were better than I expected considering the age and rarity of the material! And I really enjoyed the bonus 'gift' material. The service was prompt and efficient.,1362096000,,187,4.875
5389724,4,B00A6WXIT2,"While the quality is as advertised (VHS dubs to DVD), these are what I think of as the golden age of Shep.  Stream-of-consciousness reminiscences and odd tangents, with the smooth-as silk voice that carries me back many years.  Not for everyone, but enthusiasts will enjoy it.",1361232000,8,276,4.978260869565218

5389758,5,B00A6WXIT2,"Everyone knows Jean Shepherd from his Christmas story, but these television shows done for PBS are just as good in their own way. PBS should have released pristine copies long ago; but until they do, these VHS air monitor tapes transferred to DVD will have to do. Play them on an up-grading player for best picture quality, fix some popcorn, and enjoy Shepherd's unique voice and memory. The set is the most complete I have seen, and they are well worth the money. I was looking for ""The Greatest American Fourth of July Ever."" What I got was that classic plus eleven other DVDs of Shepherd memoir.",1407456000,5,598,4.598130841121495

5389760,5,B00A6WXIT2,"I was impressed with this product.  It was exactly how it was stated in the description, with the exception of the complete content that came in this collection. There is now a picture showing what is included. The quality is as good as you can get for this collection of difficult to fine pieces from Jean Shepherd. I am pleased to completed my quest for the addition Parker movies with this collection, as well as other pieces from the work of Jean Shepherd.",1401926400,11,460,4.542168674698795
5389761,4,B00A6WXIT2,"These rare videos are priceless. Video quality is not always great, but the Shep shines through. If you want great TV history, snatch these up.",1392336000,2,143,4.76

5389763,5,B00A6WXIT2,"I was very happy with these DVD's. They were like new shape and came quickly. They are a gift but I couldn't resist watching at least one movie (had to make sure they worked well) and it played without skips, freezes any other problems. I am very happy with this purchase.",1387497600,6,272,4.352941176470588
5389764,5,B00A6WXIT2,I recall actually viewing some of these episodes when they were originally produced. Nice job preserving them digitally going forward. My copy contained Ollie Hopnoodle.,1377302400,,169,5.8

8547262,5,B00A6WXIT2,"A literary icon. I started reading short stories by Jean Shepherd back over 50 years ago. Fascinating, creative, funny, satirical; he has it all. Of course, when the movie ""A Christmas Story"" hit the big screen back in 1983, I was instantly mesmerized.",1478736000,,252,4.883720930232558

8547267,5,B00A6WXIT2,"Amazing! I was so excited to receive all of these priceless dvd's and as an extra bonus I got ""My Summer Story"". I also was pleasantly surprised that ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"" was included. Oh my gosh. ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"" are my 2 favorites of Jean Shepherd's. I originally was looking for ""Ollie"" in the first place since I only have it on VHS. We always watch it before our Minnesota vacation every year. That made my day! The delivery came much earlier than expected also. What a find.",1440892800,,536,4.59375
