1655080,1,B00005RDRD,"Damn you Artisan Entertainment!
I've been waiting months and months to get my hands on the new Argento classic and Artisan not only delivers a weak Pan And Scan copy of the film, they edit out 90% of the violence. The elaborate and dark murder scenes are a trademark of Argento's films and without them, the film is still great but to us Argento fans, it feels like something is missing. It just goes to show that after over 30 years of making great films, Dario Argento still doesn't get half the respect in America he deserves. Anchor Bay should have gotten their hands on this film first, atleast they are respectful to the film and the fans and are not raping good cinema like Artisan. I say rent this movie for now and wait and pray that a director's cut is released in the near future.",1009843200,4,791,4.387755102040816
1655081,2,B00005RDRD,"I have seen the US version of this film and I feel betrayed! They seriously cut so much out of the Rated-R version and I'm sure the one amazon is selling is censored also even if it does say unrated. Get the dvd elsewhere, perhaps even on ebay. I could not enjoy the video properly. They could of shown this on regular television since it was cut drastically, no gore at all. Murder scenes cut so quickly you did not know what happened to the victims or a even seen a shot of blood until the very end when you see blood dripping from a window when the credits start rolling! So once again, do NOT support the US Rated R version, get an uncut version of this film because you will be missing out on so much!! Do not rent at Hollywood video nor block buster!",1009065600,,756,4.149659863945578
1655082,2,B00005RDRD,"This is a great giallo horror film, and Dario Argento has finally returned to full form with this latest effort.  The fact that this disc is not only a full-frame version of the movie (making it look like a cheap 70's television show, with grain and ""stretched"" framing) but is also probably a R-rated cut of the film-- and we'll never knoiw because Artisan gives absolutely NO information on the film's specs and there is NO extra features on the disc-- is really disapointing.  This is a poor bare-bones DVD release of a spectacular new horror thriller by one of the masters of the genre.  Too bad Artisan once again fail to recognize greatness when it's right in front of them and dish out crap like this to customers who want better DVD products for their money.  For Argento fans and DVD collectors, this is just another slap in the face by Artisan Entertainment.  Be careful when buying Artisan DVD's from now on.  You usually don't get what you pay for (I.E. see the recent Ginger Snaps Artisan DVD compared to its Canadian counterpart that actually HAS extra features to see what I mean).  A truly pitiful DVD release of a great horror film.  That's why I gave it a 2.",1008460800,23,1176,4.540284360189573
1655083,4,B00005RDRD,"Well...Dario is back, and is in a very slick mood.
I shall not babble on about how brilliant it is for him to be back, I shall just do the review!
This film starts fantastically, involving a prostitute being stalked by her client...mostly because she found this blue folder containing SOMETHING IMPORTANT :p.
She runs away and gets the train home, on the train (very empty, by the way). She then gets a phone call from her client threatening this girl with death. She gets freaked out...runs through the train screaming. She then finds a train driver. Her things she is a bit loopy. Then he dies, she finds him! She then hides in this little cupboard. THE FIRST 10 MINUTES ARE AMAZINGLY SHOT. She then gets her fingers chopped off. Poor girl.
That scene needed a VERY brief description. It is ever so violent and crazy. I would say...genius.
The murders are quite well displayed, and are quite horrific.
Lots of head bashing, BTW. And I don't mean dancing.
The music score is fantastic. It is superb, I can't believe how modern ""Goblin"" have become. It sounds as though it could be from a really good rock band. Enjoy the music too.
The acting is...bad! Max Von Sydow (or something) is very good. Although, the supporting cast are a little melo-dramatic. .
Another bad point is the plot does grow a little OTT, I recommend taking a breather. I enjoyed it more after my little break.
I have the Italian version, so the US version may be cut a little bit. I would expect it as the gore is quite disgusting (girls faces smashed up).
The best camera work?? er...the carpet scene...I shall mention three words...panning, carpet and ballerina!
Hope this was helpful...Dario is BACK ON FORM!!",1008201600,3,1685,4.657718120805369
1655084,1,B00005RDRD,"Is this the beginning of some sort of trend? I've been collecting DVDs since the format debuted, and I've been quite happy to see that even smaller titles have been available in widescreen. Now that the format is becoming incredibly popular, there seems to be a trend to go with P&S on some titles (family, horror, etc.) DVD is not just another video format, it's a way to preserve films as they should be seen, and as such should always represent the most complete version of the film. There's just no excuse for cropping and chopping the movie to fit a soon-to-be-obsolete tv format.",1008201600,5,585,4.634615384615385
1655085,4,B00005RDRD,"At first glance, 'Sleepless' seems to offer further evidence of Argento's disappointing decline since his horror heyday of the mid-70s.  The story of a serial killer murdering according to a nursery-rhyme pattern, despite having committed suicide 17 years previously, the subject matter is derivative, the narrative mechanics crude, the reliance on slasher/woman-in-peril tactics uninspired, the relentless focus on female suffering distasteful.
Look a little closer, however, and 'Sleepless' is revealed as Argento's most cunning patchwork thriller in years, revelling in its own hybridity, its deep seriousness punctured by unexpected comedy, its narrow focus inlated by the high-pitched, overblown treatment.  It is a masterly genre work (confident in its major set-pieces, unafraid of sensation and gore) that is utterly transformed by its 'high art' allusiveness.  The film is splashed with allusions to art.  A suspect is named Fabritius, whose namesake's favourite subject matter, the goldfinch, is a surreal sidekick to the detective hero, played with sympathetic world-weariness  by Max Von Sydow.  This suspect, like Toulouse-Lautrec is a dwarf; his house boasts Mondrian-esque stained windows; a particularly brutal murder is framed against Jackson Pollock-like decor.
This has the effect of stylising and abstracting the genre pleasures - one memorable murder is actually the rather mundane conclusion to endless tracking over a Matisse-like carpet, over which walk feet, costumes and a disarmingly inappropriate vacuum cleaner. The first slasher pursuit sequence, with its vicariously invasive chase-tracking down endless corridors, breaks unexpectedly for near-abstract long shots of the palely illuminated speeding train, giving a Whistler nocturne effect.  Compositions are organised around painterly colour planes - indeed, much of the film's pleasure lies in modern subject matter filmed in late-60s colour and framing.
Literary allusions abound too, from Plato (reality undermined by the continuous use of mirrors; sleeplessness suggesting a never-ending waking dream) through classical myuthology (a detective named Ulysses; the serial-killing pattern as an odyssey returning inexorably home; the plot importance of father-son tension) to Grimm, Hoffmann, Borges and Argento's contemporary Calvino (the mix of detective story and the need to find and interpret literary texts).  Like Sean Penn's 'The Pledge', 'Sleepless' concerns a detective whose reason and iconic status is disrupted by the supernatural power over him of a promise he once made.  Unlike Penn, Argento has a profound understanding of the genre, which he subverts by filming its narratives of reason, order and pattern in the style of a horror film, that genre of unreason, bodily anxiety and the murderous unrest of the past.  A bit like Argento himself, back in form with a vengeance.",1007942400,,2874,5.789099526066351
1655086,2,B00005RDRD,"Dario Argento's stylish and ultra-gory giallo is a return to form for the maestro and will definitely please his long-time fans.  Unfortunately, it looks like Artisan's upcoming DVD will be FULL-FRAME only and not widescreen as previously announced(...).  So buyer beware.  If you really want to see ""NONHOSONNO"" in it's correct aspect ratio, pick up the Italian DVD instead (if you have a region-free player) because it is uncut, letterboxed and has an english track.  Obviously Artisan is just releasing their ""Sleepless"" version as just another cheap horror title to fill up Blockbuster shelves.  Unbelievable that even in 2001 Argento is still treated this way in the US.  No wonder he stays in Italy.",1007769600,12,705,5.140350877192983
1655087,4,B00005RDRD,"After a string of financially unsuccesful movies (TWO EVIL EYES, TRAUMA, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, wow!)Daro Argento finally made a comeback in Italy, financially and critically, in January of 2001 with this giallo, SLEEPLESS (Italian Title: NON HO SONNO). I saw this movie when I was on vacation in Italy BTW. I have to say that while it's no masterpiece it's a tremendous improvement over his last few movies. The story starts with the murder of a boy's mother and the detective(Max von Sydow)who vows to the young child to catch the murderer. They think they catch the murderer but nearly 20 years the same kind of murders occur again and the detective teams up with the boy now all grown up to catch the murderer. The script is ok but you will notice some errors and stupidities in it. But the script is the least important thing in an Argento movie. The direction is great! The first 10 minutes include a murder which will have your stomach in knots. It takes place on a moving train and it's quite violent but very effective. Argento opts for more realistic cinematography in this movie but that does not diminish it's power a bit. Instead of using shadows a lot or using an abundance of primary colors he prefers to use total darkness in this movie which actually gives it a harsher tone. The acting: von Sydow is great in this movie. He displays subtle anguish as the haunted detective and he is the best actor in this movie. The rest of the young cast basically stinks, I won't go into a long tirade into how badly they are. And finally the music: the rock score by Goblin is highly effective and pumped up. It feels like a rock concert when the volume is up to 10, albeit a very scary rock concert. It may not be perfect but it's a start. Let's just hope this is a first step that will lead to better movies by Argento.",1004572800,,1852,4.45
1655108,3,B00005RDRD,"I recently got through watching the core of Dario Argento's work(75-87), and was sufficiently impressed that I decided to immediately check out some of his less acclaimed work.  First I viewed Two Evil Eyes, and was surprised by how good his segment was, and felt it was nearly equal to some of his very best work.  Next I viewed this film, Sleepless, and well, I think the title of the review pretty much says it all.  I don't demand my time back, I may check it out again some day, but as of right now I'm not terribly excited about this film.  On the plus side, it's got a really cool soundtrack, and is quite extraordinarily brutal and gory, more so than any of his other films.(It's no surprise that it's unrated) The soundtrack is by Goblin, and is quite reminscent of their classic work, particularly for Deep Red, but with more actual instruments and fewer synths.(and far more natural sounding synths too, for the most part)  I've heard them score 8 movies, I believe, and generally find there work to be quite good,(if somewhat flawed), and this is definitely some of there very best work.  The rest of the film, however, is either average or subpar.

Sadly, the film is largely lacking in the style department.  The set design is fairly conventional, and there isn't a whole helluva a lot of interesting camerawork. (Though a widescreen version would certainly be more impressive in this regard.) Quite a few perspective shots, but not that much else, and those aren't terribly exciting anymore.  Furthermore, many of the kills are very straightforward and conventional, with little buildup or flare.  Still, it has it's moments.  The double murder early in the film, both on a train and at the station  is easily the best.  More stylish than any of the other kills, and it actually has a long, reasonably suspenseful buildup.  Sadly, the actresses portraying the two victims are quite bad, which brings it down a bit, but it's quite an effective section nevertheless.  Also, the decapitation murder is done very well, with a nice long shot moving across a rug for extraordinarily long time whlie the Goblin score pounds away.  As it ends we see the victim's shadow, seemingly suspended in the air, and then see the decapitated head plop on the ground.  Definitely a grisly and effective scene.  Despite there relative lack of style, most of the other murder scenes are at least fairly effective through their brutal, disturbing nature.  We have some horrific stabbings, drowning, face-smashing, pen-jabbing, a really nasty gunshot wound and, worst and weirdest of all, the old english horn repeatedly smashed into the mouth bit.  Still, the brutal nature of much of the violence in Argento's earlier films was made far more effective by the beautiful, highly artistic nature of the film surrounding the violence, or even the violence itself.  Sleepless largely lacks this contrast, and suffers for it.  Also, the effects aren't nearly as convincing as you'd hope for such a recent film, but they work pretty well anyway.

The murder-mystery is of no great interest.  For the most part, people just sit around and talk, waiting for the next murder or the next break in the case, rather than doing all that much actual investigating.  The characters themselves are of no great interest either.  Max Von Sydow gives the best performance, as a retired detective drawn back into work by the murder's in the film, which seem to be a continuation of a supposedly solved case which he worked on nearly 20 years earlier.  Other than that the performances are pretty hit and miss, and never all that great.  The 2 first victims are particularly bad, as is the homeless man Leone, and a witness who attempts to extort money from the killer.  Most everyone else is at least passable, though no one is really sympathetic at all, other than Von Sydow's character.(and he isn't all that likable, really)

If you've seen and liked Opera, Deep Red, and Tenebre you might as well check this out.  You'll probably enjoy, even if you're not likely to be terribly impressed.  Worth a look for Argento fans, but definitely want to rent it, if at all possible.  Definitely not the first Argento film you should see.",1099094400,11,4204,4.81058495821727
1655109,4,B00005RDRD,"I really couldn't tell you why I have yet to watch every film in Dario Argento's filmography. A few years ago it was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's important works because it was often so difficult to find any of them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands. Even Troma, the flagship of flaccid filmmaking, released a so-so version of Argento's ""The Stendhal Syndrome."" It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have most likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days, more people are familiar with the director's beautiful daughter Asia than with the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a few years in the 1980s and 1990s, Argento drifted away from his tried and true giallo formula, only recently returning to some semblance of form with ""Stendhal"" and this gruesome little shocker, ""Sleepless."" Starring Max Von Sydow and Italian horror fave Gabriele Lavia, the director once again resurrects the old giallo format and marries it with upsetting scenes of gory violence.
Von Sydow plays the role of a retired detective named Moretti, a cop who had an amazing record of solving murder cases but has since suffered from rampant insomnia and a fading memory. Moretti now spends more time ambling around his house talking to his pet bird and trying to remember the specifics about the one case that eluded his grasp than anything else. That case, called the killer dwarf crimes, seemed solved when the supposed killer died as police officers closed in. Now, years later, the killings have started up again, gruesome crimes that resemble in many ways those of the original case. Moretti finds himself sucked back into working on the case even though the cops on active duty wish he would just go back to his bird and leave the investigating to younger men. Our aging cop soon teams up with the son of one of the victims of the first spate of killings and the two men embark on a quest to discover what exactly is going on. The path to solving the crime is fraught with peril: arcane clues abound, strange nursery rhymes play a big part, and Moretti's ailing memory prevent him from making connections between the latest victims and those killed in the first wave. Even worse, the killer knows Moretti is looking for him and plans on doing something about it. The conclusion to ""Sleepless"" recalls the numerous plot twists of ""Deep Red"" and ""The Bird With They Crystal Plumage,"" two of Argento's better films. There is a lot to like with ""Sleepless.""
Arguably, the best part of the film is the first twenty minutes. Argento turns a stalk and slash sequence on an empty passenger train speeding along a track into a masterful exposition of oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere matched with a pounding music score produced by none other than Goblin. Moreover, the great cinematography employed in this extended scene reveals that the director has lost none of his imaginative abilities with the camera. Even better, the beginning of the film gives the audience two amazingly beautiful women of a type rarely seen in a horror movie. Seeing these two lovely girls convinced me, more than anything else I have seen or heard, that I must visit Europe as soon as possible. Sadly, Argento dispatches the two ladies quite quickly, but that shouldn't stop a dedicated viewer from making liberal use of the rewind button on the remote control.
The rest of the film is a mixed bag, since the performances from some of the principals are mediocre (excluding the always great Max Von Sydow). The pacing occasionally lags in ""Sleepless"" as well, as the film feels like it runs too long in places. What helps move the film along are the gory killings that pop up to say hello every now and again. We get a gruesome decapitation, a nasty looking--and sounding--flute stabbing (!), an ink pen punched through a head, and a face repeatedly introduced to a brick wall in grisly close up. You come to expect imaginative and stylistic violence in an Argento film and ""Sleepless"" delivers it all in bright, flashy color. The mouth kissing brick especially brings out the cringes even though it was done better with sharp furniture corners in ""Deep Red."" Anyway, don't go into ""Sleepless"" expecting a bloodless movie that zips along at mach speed.
I've seen a lot of grumbling about the Artisan DVD version of ""Sleepless."" Since I haven't seen the European release that is supposedly much better than the American version, I will say that I thought this DVD wasn't as bad as some think. The picture quality is good even if it is a full screen release. The extras are lacking, but at least there are a few: a trailer for the movie, bios, and some sneak peeks at a few other films. Maybe it's because I have seen some ""classic"" films lately with absolutely nothing in the way of goodies on the DVD, but I did not feel cheated with the extras for ""Sleepless."" Could Argento's most recent film receive better treatment from someone else? Probably, but the movie is entertaining enough to watch even in fullscreen. If you enjoy Dario Argento films, be sure and check out ""Sleepless"" if you haven't done so already. Despite a few problems, it is still a roller coaster of a ride.",1071964800,7,5576,4.809375
1655110,4,B00005RDRD,"Sleepless lacks some of the magic of Argento's earlier films such as Deep red, inferno and Phenomona but is obviously an ""Argento"" film. Good acting and a compelling plot keep the movie interesting throughout. Typically the body count continues to rise at a pace as actors suffer inventive deaths at the killers hand. Camera work is at times superb as the hunted try and out run the murderer and the ""long carpet shot"" is brilliant (see it and you will understand). Goblin provide yet another superb sound track. This film is worth watching a few times to appreciate it properly.",1058313600,2,579,4.8
1655111,5,B00005RDRD,"First off the horrible DVD released in this country as Sleepless is pretty AWFUL in comparison to the Italian DVD.  The Italian DVD has it's original title NON HO SONNO, the menus are nice, and if you own the Artisan disc you see this menu for a brief second before it switches to the horrible static frame of the [bad] cover picture.
The Italian DVD also offers a nice clean LETTERBOXED transfer, that offers an English language track as well as english subtitles for those who want to see the film in Italian.
The film is definately a return to form for Argento, it has good pacing, the story is excellent, and at times it is quite terrifying.  It is definately better than Argento's last few films Phantom of the Opera and Trauma.
The Foriegn disc is definately the way to go, when buying this film.
The foreign disc has extras that are not on the Artisan print, The disc has a behind the scenes/making of segment , an interview with Agento(In italian w/no subs), Cast and crew information, trailers and more.",1057536000,7,1012,4.554945054945055
1655112,5,B00005RDRD,"A long awaited release, since the not-so-hot, ""Phantom of The Opera"", and ""Stendhal Syndrome"".
 Argentophiles Unite! Dario somewhat goes back to his roots here, with his earlier masterpieces, such as ""Suspiria"", ""Profondo Rossa""(aka: Deep Red), etc. Although this one does not achieve the caliber those ones did, it's still a decent movie in it's own right.
It has some touches of his earlier ""giallo's"", but drags on a little, due to the acting, which isn't so hot. Except for the great Max Von Sydow, and a decent performance by old-time Argento, and Italian Cinema great, ""Gabriele Lavia"".
Like I said, the movies a little slow in places, but it will keep you guessing until the end, of who the killer is, or isn't? It is a pretty clever script and contains various twists until the very end.
I'm in the US, and was subjected to the horrible Artisan release of the movie. But soon obtained a region-free, Pal to NTSC format player, at a very good price mind you,  from right here at Amazon,then got the UK version from MIA. All I can say is WOW!!. You can't even compare the difference. First of all it's in beautiful Anamorphic Widescreen. Something Artisan said their US release was going to be, but gave us the crap we were sort of subjected to buying instead. It has a decent selection of xtra's, and that's just disc one. Disc 2 has the documentary, ""Dario Argento: An Eye For Horror"", also in Anamorphic Widescreen.
Buck for buck, I would say, if you live in the US or Canada, try to find a player this is 1) All region. (Although this particular disc is all region anyway, but there are many other titles worth seeking out besides this release that are Region 2) and 2) Scrap this [stuff] from Artisan and get this UK import fro MIA. You'll be glad you did!
I would give the Artisan release 1 star for the presentation of the movie, (pan & scan), and 4 stars for the movie itself.
The UK Import from MIA, I would give an overall 5 stars, which reflects why I gave this 5 stars in my rating of this movie, certainly not for the US release, sorry.
If the Artisan release is your only choice, then get it, just because it's an Argento movie, and that's about it. Otherwise go for the gold and get the UK MIA release. CIAO!!",1052352000,3,2230,4.476658476658477
1655113,3,B00005RDRD,"Compared to Trauma, this movie should get 5 stars...but on its own it deserves lower. The acting is horrible more often than not, although Von Sydow is always good.

A lousy pan-and-scan.  Great movie, lousy edition.  A waste of my money.  Better than nothing?  Maybe that's what the second star is for.",1048032000,,323,5.018867924528302
1655115,3,B00005RDRD,"If you are an Argento fan (like me) and are intent on owning this film on DVD, then do yourself a favor keep reading. I went to www.amazon.co.uk and bought the movie there. It comes as a two DVD set with all kinds of goodies, including the documentary ""Dario Argento, An Eye for Horror"". This European issue also has a much better quality transfer than is currently available here in the US version. It has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound and unlike the edited down US release, this copy contains the full 117-minute film shown in 1.85:1 widescreen. The Amazon UK site mistakenly states that the DVD is Region 2, but it appears that the DVD is in fact Region Free. I have a Region 1 DVD player and it plays fine. One UK reviewer did mention that the DVD is in fact Region Free.
Now for the film. It's not a bad movie, but I would rate it as mediocre for the genre. It's certainly not Dario's best effort, but there are still lots of good scares. Argento returns to his use of vivid color themes, and though not as dramatic as in some of his earlier films, the technique still makes for interesting cinema. ""Sleepless"" also marks the return of ""Goblin"" to an Argento soundtrack. This provides one element that has certainly been missed in recent Argento films. The movie wastes no time in getting things going with a highly suspenseful and sexually charged opening scene. As the ""Italian Hitchcock"", Argento once again proves that he currently has no equals in the creation of pure suspense! Unfortunately, after that initial intense 20 minute beginning, the film begins to fade a bit and never quite seems to make it back to those levels. Finally, there is Max Von Sydow. Not much can be said given his illustrious carrer.  I'm a big Von Sydow fan, but he is almost too talented for this film!  He is a very high quality actor trapped in a somewhat shallow role. All the other actors and characters in this film seem pale by comparison.
If you're new to Argento or just exploring; then go for Tenbre, Deep Red, Phenomena, or Suspiria. If your a big Argento fan, make sure to order from Amazon.co.uk!",1045785600,,2091,4.529100529100529
1655116,3,B00005RDRD,"I am a fan of Argento.  I watched Tenebre when I was 10, the horror still implanted deeply in my mind.  I guess people will watch Sleepless either because of Argento or Goblin.  Well, the score is just too tame, compared to Suspiria - which is truly a masterpiece.  About the murder scenes, I don't find them very horrible and violent.  In some way, the special effect is just too gross - the depicated head is obviously a plastic model, the blood in the train muder is too little (compared to Tenebre), the shock is too mild (compared to Suspiria, or Inferno).  The only reason I still gave a 3 star is because of (a) Max is a good actor (and famous), (b) the plot is at least with some suspense and twist at the end, though no logic is involved as usual (how come the murderer can go onto the train so soon?) Finally, I do think the quality of the DVD is not that bad, the sound is quite good (thunder, rain drops, etc...), it is not as bad as other reviewers complained about.",1040860800,5,979,4.236559139784946
1655117,4,B00005RDRD,"Non Ho Sonno (Dario Argento, 2001)
Dario Argento moves back to giallo, which seems to have distressed a number of reviewers. He also didn't take himself or the film too seriously, which seems to have distressed even more (one of the early gimmicks for the film was posting polls on its website asking the fans which methods of offing his characters they'd most like to see). Somewhat depressing, because they're missing all the fun of this minor gem. To be fair, though, the fans don't seem to be listening; this is Argento's first film that's been widely available in America since its video release in a number of years (possibly going back as far as 1983's Creepers). Someone had to decide it needed to be on the new release shelf at your local vidshack. And more power to `em.
Non Ho Sonno is the story of Giacomo (Stefano Dionisi, probably best known to American audiences from The Loss of Sexual Innocence), whose mother was murdered twenty years before by a psychopath known as the Killer Dwarf. (Yes, you heard me right.) At the time, detective Ulisse Moretti (Max von Sydow) promised the young Giacomo he'd find the killer, even if it took him his whole life. Well, it didn't take that long; the alleged Killer Dwarf, a friend of Giacomo's named Vincenzo de Fabritiis, took his own life not long after. The problem is, twenty years later, the murders start again, and with the unmistakable signature of the Killer Dwarf.
Giallo isn't known for being deep, meaningful cinema. The enterprising video renter (for you're not going to find giallo in American cinema, thanks to Argento's Profondo Rosso doing profondo malo when released here in 1975, thanks to a butchered cut far more offensive than any of the movie's murders) who picks up a giallo should expect a whole lot of blood, a sweeping cinematic style that is unique in cinema (it has been called, and rightly, ""operatic""), and a murder mystery with a twist ending. And in the best giallo, even though you know the twist ending is coming, it's usually not what you're guessing it will be-which is, of course, the hallmark of a fine mystery.
It's also worth noting that Non Ho Sonno pairs Argento once again with one of his golden boys, Gabriele Lavia, who played two different characters named Carlo in Profondo Rosso and Inferno. (Here, his character-the father of Lorenzo, Giacomo's best friend-does not have a first name revealed during the movie. Want to take a guess at it? heh.) Lavia is always fun to watch, and it's nice to see him play someone who's not unhinged, for once. American audiences who have missed out on giallo may know him from the wonderful Tim Roth film The Legend of 1900.
The best giallo films, like Profondo Rosso, will warp your head in ways you never imagined. The rest will allow you to turn off your mind for two hours and be grandly entertained. Non Ho Sonno falls into the latter category, but that's not to denigrate it. If you're new to Argento, and your local vidshack isn't fnod of carrying twenty-five-year-old murder mysteries, this is a fine place to start. ****",1040860800,,3067,4.723880597014926

I got into the story and kept trying to guess who the bad boy was.  Max von Sydow was great, as always, and added another dimension to the mystery. I am glad I rented the VHS when I happened upon it.  After watching great photography, scary moments and good acting for the most part, I bought the VHS and watched it again.  It is far better than most of the reviewers said it was.  The sound quality of the VHS was not the best so I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.

1655129,1,B00005RDRD,"Dario Argento is one of the great directors, but this garbage is completely turgid, lacking the brilliant visceral qualities of his best work. The soundtrack was quite bad, even worse when you compare it to the best of Goblin.
Much has been said about Argento's return to the giallo, but this mystery thriller forsakes the distinctive Argento style for supposedly intricate plotting. Nevertheless, the final 'revelation' regarding the killer's identity was plain stupid and I found myself thinking ""so what?"" This is even worse than the abysmal Stendahl Syndrome and Phantom Of The Opera.
I feel compelled to write this review because so many people have labelled this a return to form for the director. This is one of the worst films imaginable. The contributions of all involved are poor, including Argento, DP Ronnie Taylor, sp fx man Sergio Stivaletti (the fake head is laughable), and the lead performance by the young actor who plays Giacomo is particularly wooden.
The disc I am discussing is actually the r2 MIA collectors edition. The only reason I'm not selling this pile of... is because of the inclusion of an extra disc containing the interesting documentary Dario Argento - An Eye For Horror.
Go for Deep Red, Suspiria, Inferno, Tenebre, Bird...,and  Phenomena; these films represent the best of argento. watch those films, then watch them again. But stay away from this appalling attempted rehash of argento's giallo glory days.",1029283200,2,1443,5.114406779661017

There are 2 ways you can rate this film, for its murder set pieces or for Storyline , for the first it stands head above shoulders better than any Hollywood tripe, this has some very very nasty voyeuristcally sadistic killings, It left a very bad taste in my mouth and I'm not a horror wimp ,  lets just say some poor gal got a mouthful of music like you can't imagine. This film is a good enough start to Argentos millennial debut but the storyline starts promising and no thanks to such poor dubbing on the VHS the end conclusion is incoherent , and your left feeling like you've half wasted your time,  as Argento fans will know this is same old problem that ruins his films. In the dubbing we get American / Cockney / italian characters and its just stupid , all his artistry is sacrificed by this which will culminate in 'Virgin viewers' blaming the director- and fair enough they lace the mans wallet. On the + side  Max Von Sydow gives a pretty good performance I cant tell if the other actors were incompetent or let down by bad dubbing.
 For entertainment the film does deliver but you need a strong stomach to watch this , Argento anoraks will love it and you'll need an anorak its bloodsoaked, if you want a story though rent Snow White.
By the way Dario's answer to why he kills so many women is simple `his mum never let him leave the light on and he thought of her as a monster' , Can you imagine being his enemy ?",1016755200,,1626,4.235483870967742

Cool these ingredients slightly, then beat in well: 1 epiphany-laden stroll through the ambered afternoon halls of a baroque art museum and  cup wall-rattling, neighbor-disconcerting speed metal (cranked up to 11).  Sift, then measure:  teaspoon stunningly influential visual style and  cup unresolved mother-issues manifesting as beautiful, yet disturbing horror films featuring maniacal black-gloved serial killers.  Stir these ingredients into the original mixture, allow to thicken.

How's your appetite?  It's true Dario Argento movies aren't for every taste bud.  If you know yourself to have a weak tolerance for cinematic horror, please stay far, far away from this latest film from the Italian maestro of mayhem.  But if horror happens to be your cup of cappuccino and you're looking for that special something for your next midnight snack, you've stumbled upon the right recipe.
""Sleepless"" (originally released in Italy under the title ""Non Ho Sonno"") is the fifteenth feature film directed by former film critic and spaghetti western screenwriter Dario Argento.  It's one of his giallo films-the Italian word for ""yellow,"" which also names a sub-genre of ultra-violent Italian-style murder-mysteries-and is his best effort in that genre since 1987's ""Opera"".
Like most of Argento's giallo films, ""Sleepless"" follows a faceless black-gloved killer compelled by a scarring childhood trauma to commit terrible acts of murder.  This time out, the police's number one suspect is a dwarf writer of mystery novels.  Seventeen years in the past, a series of murders, thought to be committed by the dwarf in question, were left officially unsolved.  Now, after years of silence, the murders have started up again.  The only problem is that the dwarf is now dead.  The chief inspector of that case, now retired, finds himself drawn back into the one case he never solved.
I think it's safe to say that no one watches a Dario Argento movie for the great acting-Argento has always been much more interested in creating imaginative, nightmarish worlds than in peopling them with believable characters.  Yet ""Sleepless"" contains by far the best performance in an Argento picture.  As Chief Inspector Morreti, veteran actor Max von Sydow (""The Exorcist,"" ""The Seventh Seal,"" ""Strange Brew"") puts in a subtle, nuanced performance that is just a pleasure to watch.
Other highlights of the film include the score by long-time collaborators Goblin (at times reminiscent of their score for George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"").  Ronnie Taylor's cinematography is also an important ingredient in the mix.  So if you're feeling adventurous and are looking for something of a decidedly un-American flavor, ""Sleepless"" could be just what your palate is craving.
Pour the mixture into a greased pan and bake for just under two hours.  Allow to cool, then slice into small pieces and enjoy.",1015200000,,3126,5.33265306122449
1655132,4,B00005RDRD,"When this movie was first announced around a year ago, I immediately rejoiced. The excellent Dario Argento (he of the classics SUSPIRIA and PHENOMENA) returning to the giallo thriller? Acclaimed actor Max Von Sydow in a major role? How could this go wrong? Then, I quickly remembered Dario's last few movies, and my heart sank. Luckily, for his fans - this time, Dario isn't ready to disappoint as SLEEPLESS (NON HO SONNO) is a striking return to form with an added bonus: This movie doesn't resemble his earlier flicks in the fact that characterisation and plot take a back seat, this one is actually story driven and besides the gorgeous visuals that are on display, Argento delivers characters that you care about and a story that is actually involving.
The story is standard giallo fare. In Turin, 1983 - a serial killer nicknamed THE DWARF (I know, I know, don't switch off just yet) is terrorising young women. Detective Moretti (played by the excellent Max Von Sydow) apparently solves the case, promptly becomes a hero and then retires from policing altogether. Fast forward 17 years later, and the killings start up again. He is drawn back into the case with the aid of a young man Giacomo (Sefano Dionisi), who's mother was killed by the Dwarf. Together, they unravel the mystery that has lasted for over 17 years.
The movie is fantastic, ranking up as one of Argento's best. The opening sequence aboard a speeding train, where the killer plays cat and mouse with a young woman is superb. A tight and never-ending scene, where you truly don't know when the killer will pop up and go BOO. Infact, the movie is littered with these great scenes of true horror, and whilst watching you begin to wonder why no one in the US can conjur up horror movies like this (I think I might throw up if some bright spark at a movie studio decides to greenlight another SCREAM clone). The cinematography is very stylish (Argento reteams with OPERA stalwart Ronnie Taylor), with the correct use of light and day sequences to truly give the feeling that no one is safe in this movie, whether it be in daylight or darkness. Also, kudos to the cast. Von Sydow is great, and slips into his role like a glove. His scenes are always moving and you are drawn to him whenever he appears on screen. The supporting cast members are also very good, which is strange for an Argento movie, as usually the dubbing or acting grates on me whenever I see his movies. Infact, I can't say anything negative about this movie . . . oh, except one thing. Yet again, Argento likes ALL of his victims to be beautiful young women. This still seems strange to me, as in most of his movies - its the fairer sex who are butchered and hardly any men. (This movie is no exception, and the death sequences are truly horrible. Witness the death of Giacomo's mother in flashback - yeah, obviously a fake head effect - but, the implications of the scene are quite disturbing. The deaths throughout the picture depict women being beaten to a pulp, cut open and generally treated like meat. So, if you are a casual viewer, approach this movie with caution - I, even as a big Argento fan found this movie to be a little TOO MUCH in the way of female killing. Maybe next time Dario, skewer a few guys, huh? Just to even it out?)
Now, lets get onto the actual DVD. For starters and best results, try to see this film at a movie theater. This film was made for the cinema. Now, as that is largely impossible outside of Italy (hey, it's not got a cast member from a US TV show in the cast list!), DVD is your only bet. However, do not buy the US release of the movie. Try to get the UK Region 2 'MIA Video' 2-disc release. On disc one, not only do you get a beautiful widescreen transfer of the movie, but also a 'making of', a european theatrical trailer and bios. Not bad, I would be quite happy with that. But, that's not all - on disc two you also get the new cool Dario Argento documentary with insights not only about him, but snippets from Romero, Carpenter, etc. A great addition for any Argento fan. So, all-in-all, a great return to form with a 5-star disc. Forget those kiddie horror movies that have littered our movie theatres and video stores for the past 5 or 6 years - go for real horror directed by one of the best guys around. Oh yeah, whilst your burying bad memories, try to forget about The Stendahl Syndrome as well . . .",1015113600,,4393,4.458385093167702
1655133,4,B00005RDRD,"It's been almost a decade since Dario Argento released his last good movie (""Opera""), and although ""Sleepless"" is no masterpiece like ""Profondo Rosso"", ""Suspiria"" or ""Tenebrae"", it is a most welcome return to form for Argento. It's nice to see that in this day and age Argento can still make a disturbing and entertaining movie like he once used to (John Carpenter eat your heart out!), so now we can finally forgive him for his previous outings.
""Sleepless"" contains a sublime Goblin score, extremely bloody murders, exquisite camerawork, an okay cast (contrary to what most people believe, ""Sleepless"" was recorded on-set in English, with most actors being redubbed for the Italian version) and a typical Argento storyline that doesn't make much sense, but is always tremendously enjoyable. All these ingredients contribute to make this an excellent vintage Argento movie.
I'm not going to mix myself in the Artisan-release debate. All you need to know is that the DVD version released in the UK by MIA is in glorious widescreen and uncut, and features a second disc with the one-hour documentary ""Dario Argento - An Eye for Terror"" on it! Even better: the discs are Region Free!

7952162,5,B00005RDRD,"Originally entitled as ""Non ho sonno"" and released in 2001, this remains as a classic Giallo film, very well accomplished by the best living maestro of this movie genre, Dario Argento. The story has all what is needed for a mystery and murder film of this type, including suspense, a good story, and good characters. Two additional pluses of the film include the great Max von Sydow as retired police detective Moretti, and lots of excellent gore during murder scenes. In short, a very good Giallo film in terms of story and gore. I really depart from those negative reviews on this film. Please, note that this film goes in the European (Italian) tradition of murder and mystery films, and has nothing to do with the US tradition of horror films. If you like Italian Giallos, I highly recommend this one.

This comment refers to the PAL, region 2 DVD version. Technically, an excellent Widescreen transfer by Arrow Films. The Audio comes in English without subtitles.

7952165,4,B00005RDRD,"""Sleepless"" accurately describes the serial killer in this superb giallo from Dario Argento, the Italian Hitchcock who directed such horror masterpieces as ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria.""  The killer can never sleep because he is constantly waiting for the right moment to begin killing again.

  Seventeen years ago, there were a series of brutal slayings that had a pattern.  Each victim represented an animal from a nursery rhyme.  A children's author, a dwarf, was suspected of being the serial killer; the dwarf committed suicide and the killings ended.  Now, the nightmare has begun again and it is believed that the dwarf has either returned from the dead or there is a copy cat.  Perhaps it never was the dwarf.

  Max von Sydow (Father Merrin in ""The Exorcist"") investigated the original dwarf killings.  He comes out of retirement to help solve the latest murders.

  ""Sleepless"" has numerous scenes involving beautiful women being chased up staircases and through trains.  They reminded me of Argento's earlier works, such as ""Suspiria,"" and Mario Bava's gothic masterpiece ""Baron Blood.""  The soundtrack from Goblin was awesome; it helped increase the tension to a fever pitch level.  There were many gruesome deaths; the body count was relatively high.  It is easy to see that this is when Argento's movies began becoming increasingly more gruesome and gory.

  ""Sleepless"" may never receive the status of classic giallo that Argento's earlier works have achieved but it is an extremely enjoyable, fast paced ride with twists and turns.  The true killer was not as easy for me to identify as they have been in other gialli.  ""Sleepless"" is definitely on a par with ""Opera,"" ""The Card Player,"" and ""Trauma.""  It has more style and class than Argento's latest gore- and sex-driven works for Masters of Horror:  ""Pelts"" and ""Jennifer.""

  My only complaint is with Artisan.  An anamorphic format should have been made available along with the full screen format.  Otherwise, the audio and video are great and there are English subtitles for those of us who have a hard time clearly hearing every word.

  ""Sleepless"" from Artisan is highly recommended for those who are fans of Italian gialli and fans of Dario Argento.",1217894400,,2224,5.069252077562327

The avid gore hound will be happy with over the top violence in the murders and the soundtrack by the now familiar ""Goblin"" is insanely pulsating. The first 15-20 minutes are worth the price alone, amzingly gripping and suspensful. After that the middle may fall into the tedious catagorie but pulls itself together at the end.
