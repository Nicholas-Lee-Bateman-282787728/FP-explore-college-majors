6132199,1,B00H4KQN82,"After tempting horror fans with a possibly legitimate release of the horror Holy Grail, HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, Timeless Media/Shout Factory dumps it in favor of VAMPIRE LOVERS. There is nothing wrong with VAMPIRE LOVERS except that its been readily available on DVD and Blu-ray for years, while the much sought after HOUSE THE SCREAMED has never enjoyed a decent release to any format.

I know it's annoying when people give a negative review to a disk before it even comes out, but there has been so much buzz about the video debut of HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, that this will probably prove to be a deal-breaker for a lot of buyers.",1393459200,11,626,4.6909090909090905

6132201,2,B00H4KQN82,"THE SCREAMING SKULL, one of my childhood favorites, is unwatchable here.  The voices are complexly out of sync as the film goes on.  I had to take this and make my own copy from it and put it in sync myself.
Hey, if I could do that with my limited equipment, why couldn't the quality control  at Timeless/Shout Factory have found this major flaw and fixed it first?  Shameful!
The problem is that this is the best quality image-wise that I have ever seen.",1426204800,3,455,4.380952380952381
6132202,5,B00H4KQN82,Best print I have ever seen of The Screaming Skull! I enjoyed all 4 movies! I love stuff like this! Excellent cheap price as well! Fast shipping!,1419292800,,145,4.407407407407407
6132203,4,B00H4KQN82,I picked this up as a way of being able to use free shipping. Great deal I watched two of the movies and have no issue with the set. Good transfers and audio is fine. Good rainy day fun. Vampire lovers is a Hammer film. Peter Cushing and Douglas Wilmer both are in it. That alone makes it a fun  set to have.,1413849600,4,308,3.888888888888889
6132204,5,B00H4KQN82,Fantastic collection of classic horror films at an unbeatable price. Great copy.,1412985600,,80,5.75
6132205,1,B00H4KQN82,"For horror fans, the main reason for buying this set was the chance to finally see ""The Screaming Skull""...long relegated to budget dvd hell...finally given a proper release (the other three titles on this set have already had superior home media releases, so they don't offer much incentive to purchase the dvd). While this release of ""The Screaming Skull"" is the most visually stunning I have ever seen, I am highly disheartened to have to report that the audio goes out of sync on the film around the 43 minute mark. It becomes quite noticeable, especially when the sight of a car door closing does not in the least bit coincide with the sound. These sync issues are not on the many budget releases of this movie, and I have confirmed with friends who own this release that the sync issues are on all the discs. Hopefully, Shout Factory (parent company of Timeless Media Group) will fix this correctable issue at some point and offer replacement discs.",1412121600,8,955,4.724550898203593
6132206,5,B00H4KQN82,I bought this mainly for Screaming Skull and The Vampire. Both really good films and much better quality than the previous versions I owned.,1409097600,3,140,4.875
6132207,5,B00H4KQN82,"This collection places the reviewer in a conundrum: Does one review the collection as a whole or its most desirable features? I decided on the later, since I would gladly have paid double the purchase price for this print of 'The Screaming Skull.' As a collector, I have owned about a half-dozen prints of this movie, and, to date, the print used in this collection is by far the best I've ever seen. The sound goes a little off track during the last fifteen minutes or so, but that barely detracts from the pleasure of seeing this Floyd Crosby gem. Movies 4 You: Horror includes another genre classic, Hammer Studios' 'Vampire Lovers,' arguably one of the finest vampire films ever made. Those familiar with the film will be annoyed by what I call compression. The films lush atmosphere has been reduced in four-movie format, and the sound can only be called poor. The harsh audio really hurts the funeral scene.

'The Vampire' from 1957 is a solid film from a good print. 'The Bat People' from 1974 is throw-away.

In general, this set should be considered 'The Screaming Skull' with bonuses. Mine reached  my home in 16 hours after purchase--a phenomenal job of service from Amazon Prime. A ridiculous bargain at $6.99!",1408320000,22,1222,4.754716981132075
6132208,3,B00H4KQN82,"For those of you who are buying this disc for The Screaming Skull, it is what you've been waiting for. The image is crisp. And during the last ten minutes the sound went out of sync. I have to say that I didn't care a whole lot as I don't believe I ever want to see it again. The quality of the image on the other three titles is equally good.",1405987200,4,343,3.8450704225352115
6132209,3,B00H4KQN82,"This is by far the best transfer of The Screaming Skull out there, complete with the Peggy Webber bra scene missing from some versions. The image is nice and sharp. The sound, however, isn't the greatest but maybe it never was to begin with. Too bad the movie isn't better but it is fun if you are in an undemanding mood. I checked out The Vampire Lovers and although the transfer is good the music has an annoying warble which thankfully isn't on the MGM Midnight Movies DVD of this title. I still wish that The House That Screamed could have been included as it would have made the disc far more worthwhile.",1402358400,8,609,4.398230088495575
6132210,5,B00H4KQN82,"they are all good
alot of fun and great for parties.
if you have some the titles on bluray and don't want pull them out to watch them, then it's great to have this copy for a knock around.",1402185600,,188,3.8461538461538463
6132211,1,B00H4KQN82,"I'm not going to bothering returning something that cost seven bucks but lesson learned - check your order up to the day it was fulfilled! I was only buying this for House That Screamed. I have the Mill Creek crap copy and was hoping for a better release. Oh well. I have all the other movies, including Vampire Lovers. Very disappointing but shame on me I guess.",1399939200,,363,4.432835820895522
6132212,1,B00H4KQN82,"As usual they are cramming 4 movies on a single disc. Plus with all the edited prints and wrong soundtracks, who cares!!!!!!! However the MGM print of ""The Screaming Skull"" is beautiful,It has run on Blockbusters streaming site.",1398556800,4,228,5.026315789473684
6132213,5,B00H4KQN82,"As with several others I long for a decent release of THE SCREAMING SKULL, my major reason to purchase this set. And having both THE VAMPIRE and THE VAMPIRE LOVERS on flipper discs, I'm ok with their release on this single sided disc. BAT PEOPLE I've managed to avoid until now, so that's ok too. Hopefully THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED will be forthcoming, along with many other such bargain sets from SHOUTFACTORY/TIMELESS which always have better public domain releases than the ones I constantly need to upgrade...Keep 'em coming!",1395360000,11,528,4.943820224719101
6132214,5,B00H4KQN82,"I like these sets and for the price, one can't really complain! I don't have The Bat People or a decent print of Screaming Skull, so for me this is an essential DVD purchase, more of these sets please?",1394668800,4,201,4.17948717948718
6132215,5,B00H4KQN82,"Nice price for four movies and while I've seen all of these films, it will be great to finally get them on DVD.",1394582400,4,111,3.869565217391304
6132216,4,B00H4KQN82,Just to let you know. the house that screamed you can get in the pure terror 50 movie pack from mill creek. And it's under $10,1394323200,4,126,3.8846153846153846
6132217,2,B00H4KQN82,"...might as well just release The Screaming Skull by itself. Whover wants The Bat People & The Vampire Lovers own them already, and no-one will buy this for The Vampire.",1393718400,5,169,4.666666666666667
6132218,1,B00H4KQN82,"While this upcoming release will sport a remastered SCREAMING SKULL, many fans were hoping for the 1st official English release of the excellent Spanish Gothic HOUSE THAT SCREAMED.  There is most certainly a market for this film to be remastered and released, preferably on Blu Ray.  Please give it some serious consideration.  Replacing the highly sought after HOUSE with the commonly available VAMPIRE LOVERS is akin to a facekick to the market for these films, along with squeezing 4 films onto a single sided 8 gig disc.",1393632000,8,524,5.0

8629944,4,B00H4KQN82,"A nice bargain.  However, in addition to the audio problems, it should also be noted that ""The Screaming Skull,""  is a pan and scan version.  This is especially odd since the other three films are letterboxed.  Some of the previous public domain releases of this film are letterboxed.  Like the other ""Movies 4 You"" this was a very welcome bargain and I hope there will be more to come.",1469750400,,386,4.536231884057971
8629945,2,B00H4KQN82,"The Screaming Scull starts out all right, but then the audio gets further and further out of sync the further you watch. The Vampire Lovers has a weird fluttering/warbling distortion in the low end throughout the entire movie that is very aggravating. I'm no audiophile (especially on a 4-for-$4 movie collection) but these movies should never have been released with audio this bad.

This is especially too bad because the video quality is great! Worlds better than the pan-and-scan copies I've seen of a couple of them elsewhere. I think it's as good as you can expect from movies this old, that were shot on lower budgets, on a standard definition format like DVD. A lot of what some people describe as bad video quality is just things like film grain in lowlight shots that were products of the materials they were originally produced on.

Content advisory: I was surprised that The Vampire Lovers was rated R, and that it contained significant nudity. It was the best made of the films (audio issues in this edition aside), but if you're assuming that all of these movies will be appropriate for all ages because they are old and cheesy, maybe watch it alone before watching it with your kids. If you are bothered by the theme of lesbian vampiric supernatural seduction, you may also want to steer clear of Vampire Lovers.",1463270400,2,1327,4.765217391304348

8629950,5,B00H4KQN82,"I can't believe how amazing ""The Screaming Skull"" looks! I never thought I would see this film clear & crisp. The sounds does have some issues, but for the price it's totally worth it. ""The Bat People"" was actually fun in a bad way and I enjoyed it. Highly recommended for any horror collector. I will purchase all the others in this series based on the good quality of this disc.",1430956800,,380,4.366197183098592
