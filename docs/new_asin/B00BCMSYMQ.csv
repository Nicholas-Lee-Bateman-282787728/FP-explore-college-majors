5578175,5,B00BCMSYMQ,"It's funny how I used to watch this show when I went to college. I just had to see Kaitlin, I ain't gonna lie! Okay, I can't count out Ryan Steele, or JB Reese. Those guys could kick some Skug butt!! It was a trip to see the daily adventures of the heroes of Cross World City repeatedly defeating the evil industrialist Carl Ziktor/Grimlord. I can't wait to complete my VR Troopers collection when the remaining half of season two is finally released. I love Shout! factory! They are my heroes!",1374796800,,494,4.43956043956044

5578179,5,B00BCMSYMQ,"I thought I should put this review in here to counter the reviewer that gave it 1 star.  I can't believe he would rather watch Beetleborgs than this...  This series rocked! (Although so did Power Rangers...)  I don't want to put any spoilers in here, but major plot developments start to happen during this part of the series with lots of changes, and I enjoyed it every bit as much as season 1, maybe more.  Except for Jeb the talking dog this series was actually more mature than Power Rangers.  Even the characters portrayed appeared to be out of high school and had jobs!  Don't let the negative review fool you --this was a great series in its own right and Saban did a great job with it.  I can't say anything for the quality of the DVD release as it hasn't come out yet, but if it's as good as the first 2 volumes, it will be great!",1361836800,3,839,4.238993710691824
5578180,4,B00BCMSYMQ,"I am glad that Shout has been putting this out to DVD.  VR Troopers is worth watching because it has some interesting storylines.  For the record, VR Troopers is better than Beetle Borgs.  There is absolutely no drama or seriousness to Beetle Borgs.  Of course if you make pre-teen kids into super heroes, what would you expect?  The way they obtain their powers has no class.  A haunted house and a genie?  What's fascinating about that?  An idea like that is better suited for material such as Ernest movies.  On the other hand, it was probably part of Saban's intent to present the kids with heroes who were more on their level, as apposed to young adults.  All I'm saying is that Beetle Borgs doesn't have any interesting storys.  It's like watching a looney toones cartoon.  I think I'll stick with control panels, columns and portal entrances.  I will admit that VR Troopers is pretty silly as well, but at least Jeb the dog and Ryan's search for his dad helps to balance things out.  Beetle Borgs has nothing to balance on.  It's just a bunch of zany elementary/junior high hi-jinks from beggining to end.",1361232000,3,1112,4.630769230769231

5578182,5,B00BCMSYMQ,Shout is doing it and doing it well! Thank you and I hope that the 2nd and final volume will be released soon after it.

8566098,5,B00BCMSYMQ,This show is just as equal to the power rangers. About the same kind of action/adventure. I aways thought saban made great shows in those days. I watched vr troopers each chance I got and I am glad to have found it on dvd. I don't think anyone will regret buying this set. It's just great.,1423180800,,289,4.178571428571429
