ABOUT THE MUSIC: The first two LICHTMOND productions Moonlight and Universe of Light Real 3D Blu-ray format were especially popular with home theatre viewers. Now is the time to showcase the creative writing talents of Giorgio and Martin Koppehele and their wives Gabi and Suna. LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY is totally unique in the pop music of the 21st century. Its incredible imagery is the icing on the cake. Martin Koppehele says, ""We see our music as a magic triangle of electronics, the rock of the 1970s and 1980s and ethno music,"" This special blend makes LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY so outstanding and totally unique.

Martin Koppehele says, ""The music of Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream and Alan Parsons strongly influenced us in our youth. Based on this inspiration, we developed our own style. This mixture is the source of our originality."" Giorgio adds: ""Another thing that shapes us is our distinct aesthetic approach. The sounds are just as important as the compositions."" This is quickly evident when listening to LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY. The mostly epic tracks are kaleidoscopic, a thousand facets of light. Sometimes quiet, sometimes hyper tempos enchant the listener within a delightful daydream that one never wants to leave.

Supported by prominent guest artists such as Midge Ure, I Muvrini, Sky du Mont and Hardy Krueger Jr., LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY succeeds as an exotic, other-earthly, sound painting that oscillates like yin and yang between the poles. Giorgio says, ""The fact that the core members are two men and two women which plays an important role and is probably one reason for our success. The melodies, which often make up the soul of the music, as well as the lyrics and poems, usually come from our wives. This is a very special blend. Martin's wife Gabi writes the poems and the German lyrics, my wife Suna, writes the melodies and the English lyrics. Sounds, beats, loops, electronics and the LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY sound-architecture"" are the ""masculine"" part of this 3D Blu-ray disc. Again the artists Meera F (vocals and piano), Thomas E. Killinger (poems and piano), Saskia Philipps (vocals) and Karen Kassulat (vocals) are an important part of LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY.

LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY is an acoustic metamorphosis of changing atmospheres. Reminiscent of the best of Pink Floyd's semi-acoustic ballads LICHTMOND's Wheel of Time follows Catching Rainbows with a trance-electro-beat. Empires of the Past is driven by tribal beats through a thunderstorm to a veritable rock format, beautifully supported by a stunning poem spoken by Sky du Mont.  LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY soars with the exotic voices, such as the Corsican vocalists I Muvrini of the global world music scene, with is almost galactic anthem. Endless Moments jointly composed with Midge Ure and sung by the Ultravox front man. All of the songs are different, each touching in its own way, enigmatic, stimulating, and imaginative.

They both start to explain what the concept of the video is all about and explain in great detail the scenario outline on what they wanted to achieve in allowing the viewer to experience something totally unique. They also explain each different video concept, staring with Nightflight To Chronos - Part 1 and slowly go through all the videos explaining the concept of each storyline, so to give you a better understanding on what you view with each Real 3D video. They also give great praise about the music artists that were involved with their project and felt much rewarded for their input, and those particular people were of course Midge Ure from Ultravox, Diego Bonati, Javier Senz-Messa, plus Hardy Krger Jr. [German actor]. They talk about the bonus tracls and especially Salvation that they were very excited about, especially having the German actor Hardy Krger Jr. The second bonus track they mention is Gravitational Attraction [which does not seem to be on this Blu-ray] and explain is an electronic music conception, meaning all the musical instruments were used on 1980s pop records and they wanted you to experience a lot of fun listening to it. Next we see the actual recording studio where they are working on one of the video tracks with Hardy Krger Jr., recording the song Salvation, and at the same time view the actual video. Next up is a personal interview with Midge Ure talking about his involvement with the video Endless Moments, and informs us that he had such a brilliant time and was totally overwhelmed with the finished video. We also get to see the other music video artists Diego Bonati and Javier Senz-Messa recording their songs and at the same time view the actual video. Then we move to behind-the-scene of all the people who were involved in producing the whole video concept. All in all this a great insight to all involved in producing the awesome the LICHTMOND 3: DAYS OF ETERNITY Real 3D video concept.

8671930,4,B00MF1JWAG,"The visual effect are amazing, but I was very careful to insure the disk info. stated it also played in 2D.  After opening, there was the 3D disk, but no 2D version.  Some disks  do have a menu to select 2D or 3D.  Not the case.  In reading the cover again, it says it plays 2D on a ""regular player"".  Since  I only have a blu-ray player that has 3D capability, I cannot play 2D.  Seems to me the way it is advertised,  it should have an option to play 2D or 3D on a bluray player,  regardless if it  has a 3D capability or not.

Edit - Was able to set blu-ray to 2D only and now can also watch in 2D, although not quite as convenient as having a menu on the disk with the option. Rated as four star for the minor inconvenience noted and because music was good but not what I usually enjoy, but this is preference thing.",1453248000,2,820,3.96319018404908
8671931,5,B00MF1JWAG,"Of the three LICHTMOND, this is the best.  Of course, I say this because it has 9.1 Auro 3d dts HD MA in English poem.  The first two LICHTMOND titles had only 2.0 English.

The 3d video is the best of the three.  The first two are great in their own right, but this one, at times, seems to draw the viewer right into the screen.

The audio matches the visual perfectly and makes the ""story"" flow smoothly.

The only problem with this title, as with the first two, is its over too soon.  If they were to reissue the first two with a 9.1 Auro dts in English, I would buy in a heartbeat.

I highly recommend this and any LICHTMOND title!

8671933,5,B00MF1JWAG,"Lichtmond 1 (Monnlight), Lichtmond 2 (Universe of Light) and Lichtmond 3 (Days of Eternity) are three phenomenal albums, nothing short of amazing. It is an incredible synergy of music mixed in surround sound and 3D computer generated videos of imaginary worlds, all perfectly blended together. I cannot decide for myself which of the three albums is better. The 3D is one of the best I've seen, the surround mix is one of richest I've heard, the colors are beautiful, and the music is very pleasing. There is no real story (the artists' web site has downloadable documents with a write-up of the story and lyrics, but I see no value in it) - it is nothing but a audio-visual feast of incomparable beauty. I've never seen anything like that before. No words to describe it. One has to see it. It is a pity that Lichtmond is not widely available in the US; in Europe, as one can learn from the musicians' web site, these albums collected all imaginary awards - Best BluRay music album, best 3D music album, etc.

If you built yourself a surround sound 3D home theater with a big screen TV and were looking for just one Blu-Ray which would enable you to fully show the potential of your system, any of the Lichtmond albums would be a perfect choice. Not Avatar, not any of the Disney 3D movies - Lichtmond. Nothing gets even close to it.

Oftentimes, the first album or movie in a series is the best, the sequels are weak. Not with Lichtmond. Lichtmond 3 is just as good or better than Lichtmond 1.",1415923200,6,1495,4.512915129151292
