5323945,5,B009F6PT6A,This movie is amazing. It gives the story of Jesus through the eyes of Mary and Magdalene. Mary as the mother and wife. Joseph as husband and father to Jesus. Magdalene as the childhood friend of Mary. What a wonderful movie. I can not get this movie out of my mind. The movie is dedicated to mothers.,1374883200,9,301,4.298245614035087
5323946,5,B009F6PT6A,I wanna start off by saying i blew this movie off and the only reason i watched it was because i had to sit with my uncle at home and its what he was watching. I fell in love with this movie it has such a great point of view coming from Mary and Mandolin. I was always curious about what it was like for her and this was great at showing me!!! i have watched it 3 times already and i cant stop thinking about it. I highly recomend it,1374624000,7,433,3.769230769230769

8540849,5,B009F6PT6A,"I loved the movie at the theater, that is why I ordered a copy to watch over and over again. However, the dvd I received was not playable the U.S., was used, not new as advertised and paid for, no libretto, and, not anchored in case.  I thank Amazon for facilitating the full refund and I look forward to being able to one day own my copy of Maria di Nazaret.",1405036800,2,359,4.056338028169014
8540850,1,B009F6PT6A,Well first the movie was a good film. But you sent the Italian version when I wanted the English version. So it was hard to follow the movie.,1404604800,,141,4.071428571428571
8540851,5,B009F6PT6A,"Anyone who loves our Lord Jesus should watch this outstanding portrayal of His Blessed Mother,Mary of Nazareth. I have read plenty of books regarding Her life through private revelation. Not much is written in the Bible about Her save the prophecies and the major events during Chrit's public ministry, passion,death and Pentecost. Most people dont't know Her life story outside of the typical portrayal in movies ,etc. Maria de Nazaret takes the viewer to the true Heart of Who Mary The Mother of God, Jesus Christ Is. This production gets who Mary is right. She is beautifully portrayed and the movie projects The true Love that She ,Jesus and Joseph shared and lived the way God Had Ordained and Promised the world. I have watched this many times and it only gets better. Make sure to have some Kleenex handy. This will make you laugh, cry, learn and most of all feel God,
s Love! Truly amazing! Enjoy and may God Bless you!",1403654400,4,927,4.693251533742331
8540852,5,B009F6PT6A,"i saw this on netflix so no issues over regional codes. I have heard this is not the same as Mary of Nazareth the USA film of 2013 release although the same actors...perhaps the other version is edited or in some way different, i just don't know. this is about 3+ hours, but it is riveting. Acting is wonderful, a lot of emphasis on Magadalene which while we cannot find these incidents in the Bible, she is brought in as foil to Mary so it is 2 women's view of Jesus. I think this is the only reason she is given such importance in the film. Even so, the film is wonderful at conveying the powerful faith pf the Mother of Christ as well as what she must have felt as a mother. It's a film very well worth seeing. i will watch again most likely.",1389052800,,745,4.109589041095891
8540853,5,B009F6PT6A,"This movie is so powerful that I am going to purchase the DVD for each of my grandchildren. Every actor was a perfect choice and portrayed the character in such a way that I felt they had actually known the person they were portraying. I was glued to the TV screen and even turned off my telephone ringer so I wouldn't be interrupted. I recommend it for every Christian who feels as I do about the Savior and how he suffered for each of us. Buy it and own it and watch it over and over! The movie I saw was on Netflix and the actors spoke in the English language, not Italian or Spanish. There are subtitles, however.",1379376000,2,617,4.19327731092437
