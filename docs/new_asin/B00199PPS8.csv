3430498,4,B00199PPS8,In basic terms its more of the same. There's no new ground broken. The movie on the whole is better than the first one though. The action is better choreographed. The comedy aspects are a bit more slapstick I think but they are well done. If you didn't like the first one at all this one won't change your opinion. If you were on the fence with the first on though... this one might tip the scales for you.,1319587200,,406,4.151898734177215
3430499,4,B00199PPS8,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. The English appears dubbed but is in sink with action and lips.  It is strange that the subtitles do not match what is said in English, sometimes way different and unrelated to the action. Action, acting and stunts are first class and never ending.  It seems like someone dies or gets bashed every 20 seconds during the movie. So it definitely qualifies as an Adult video.  Movie seems to contain more humor than violence and I personally wanted to take out his crazy wife which maybe the humor they added. Some T & A but don't remember any total nudes, just lots of legs. The lead/spy become a singer and makes good trying to gather information about their illegal activities and that to seem full of misfortunes and humor. Watch it and if you have the change, buy it.",1278201600,2,814,4.523809523809524
3430500,3,B00199PPS8,"Petchtai Wongkamlao's first solo film vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodyguard/dp/B00199PPRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodyguard</a>&nbsp;was not a good movie at all, but apparently Thai producers thought well enough of it to give its follow-up the biggest budget of any film made in Thailand...and guess what? It paid off by having the series go from completely forgettable to completely watchable. I'm still not entirely sold on the idea of Thai action-comedies, but if you're interested in the field, then this one is a good place as any to start.

The story: set before the events of the first movie, a struggling security specialist (Wongkamlao) goes undercover as a hugely-successful pop star to investigate the two criminalizing heads of his record company.

While anybody can tell that this is a decent movie, it's best regarded in comparison to its predecessor. Know that it tops the original film in all fields, most importantly in the all-vital areas of humor and action...particularly in the latter one. The lengthy action scenes - wrangled by legendary choreographer Panna Rittikrai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-The-Thai-Warrior/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior</a>) - aren't without humor but can easily be watched for their adrenaline rushes alone. The opening shootout/fight/chase scene is the best example of this: lasting a full 20 minutes and serving as a great introduction for Wongkamlao, it's not nearly as refined as most non-devotees are used to but features more quality action than some Hollywood productions show during their entire runtime. A lengthy hand-to-hand fight featuring a female ninja and about a hundred bad guys in orange suits surpasses expectations as well, and the mandatory cameo by Tony Jaa (who wants his elephant back) helps make this one more accessible to newcomers of Thai butt-kicking. Good stuff.

Asian humor of any kind is lost on me, but ""Bodyguard 2"" makes strides to make it more accessible to us non-Thai. Further distancing itself from the low standards of the first film, this one sets more store by humorous characters than by situational laughs. Sure, the movie opens in a gay club and uses name-calling as a few punchlines, but in the end, it's the personalities that you remember...like Jacqueline Apitananon as Wongkamlao's nagging wife who frequently vocalizes how sex-starved her husband has left her, or fellow comedian Pongsak Pongsuwan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killer-Tattoo/dp/B00019GHFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killer Tattoo</a>) as a perverted guru who practices facial massage therapy with his bare feet. Even bit characters like the ill-fated window cleaners from the beginning of the film remain in your mind for a while afterwards. All of this is still interspersed with Thai pop references that will make the movie harder to appreciate for anybody not native to Thailand, but at least you can still tell why most of this stuff is supposed to be humorous.

Again, this is the most expensive film ever made in Thailand, but the fact that it still looks like a basic production when compared internationally says a lot about how far Thai cinema still has to go. Nevertheless, it still looks good and is definitely on top of the heap of films that you ought to check out when immersing yourself into the Thai movie scene.",1270684800,,3491,5.681992337164751
3430501,5,B00199PPS8,The movie was off the hook. Action pack from the start to the end. Thank you very much.,1257379200,,87,3.888888888888889
3430502,3,B00199PPS8,"The Good Things
*Pretty good video quality; possibly better than the first ""Bodyguard"" DVD.
*Good audio. Includes both English and its original Thai. Also had Spanish subtitles.
*Inclues a 30-minute making-of featurette.
*Filming style is pretty good.
*Includes some very slick, exciting action scenes and some weird zany comedy. Has a couple of cool martial arts fight scenes.  Some of the other action scenes are better than the first film.
*Characters are pretty good. Good acting.

The Bad Things
*Not for kids; contains violence, swearing, and nudity.
*Cover art is rather misleading. It looks like a stylish action flick, but is really a comedy.
*It doesn't seem to be as funny as the first film.

The Questionable Things
*Good grief, the main character's wife sure is annoying.  Could be good, because it adds to the comedy and conflict.  But, I found her annoying.
*Storyline is quite different.  The main character spends most of the time trying to become a popular singer (I guess that was his cover or something; I don't recall now).  I liked the story in the first film better, which was a more straightforward story about cops, assasins, and criminals.

The Other Things
*Widescreen presentation enhanced for 16:9 TVs.

After the first ""Bodyguard,"" I was ready for more zany comedy and action.  This sequel is not as funny as I hoped it would be, but it does have some better (and crazier) action scenes.  It's generally entertaining, but would only reccomend it if you've seen the first film.",1221523200,8,1506,4.960159362549801

8273083,5,B00199PPS8,"I watched this movie on streaming, expecting a standard action flic. It took only a few minutes to realize that this is actually an action flic spoof in the finest tradition of Airplane! or The Naked Gun. There is very little slap stick - most of the humor is genuinely surprising, though a passing familiarity with other Thai movies (Tony Jaa) helps to understand some of the references. A gem of a movie from a country that ordinarily produces very little that doesn't look like a B movie.",1400803200,,491,4.590909090909091
8273084,5,B00199PPS8,"Initially I recognized Tony Jaa and figured he would play a large role in the movie. This was not true, in fact Tony Jaa makes a very brief cameo in both the Bodyguard and the Bodyguard 2. However if you have watched any of Tony Jaa's other films such as the Ong Bak trilogy or the Protector then you will recognize Petchtai Wongkamlao from those films and the smaller roles he has played. I happen to think he is funny so to see him as the main character in a somewhat serious role and still be funny is a great change of pace for me. If you're willing to take all of the above into consideration then you will  love it too.",1370822400,,625,4.122950819672131

8273086,4,B00199PPS8,"This is a comedy-action movie, with emphasis on comedy. It is from Thailand (not Taiwan). I'm not seeing a rating in the ""Product Details"" but I think it should be rated R for violence (though it's close to cartoonish violence, with blood). The action was good, there's a lot of jokes, and some of the jokes were hilarious. It's not a cinematic masterpiece but I definitely enjoyed it. If I were in more of a grade-inflation mood I'd give it 5 stars.",1369526400,,450,4.5
8273087,5,B00199PPS8,"A fun ""six-pack"" Taiwanese movie with non-stop laughs, action, and stupid jokes that hit the mark.  Watch early for the shooter with the eyebrows and later for Eminem waiting with Michael Jackson.  The wit is very fast paced, the stunts are rapid and slapstick.  The English lip-dub is right-on (correct me if I'm wrong about this being a lip-dubbed movie please).  I laughed from the opening scene to the last.  I didn't understand the credit roll humor as this was my first Taiwanese movie but I thoroughly enjoyed the 95 minutes devoted to this movie...",1363132800,,556,4.810526315789474
