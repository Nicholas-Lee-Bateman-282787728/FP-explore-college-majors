I am very fortunate to come across this DVD by Swami Mukundanada ji on spirituality in which he explained the goal of human life, that is not for anchoring material pleasures but to search for soul happiness which we will receive only by realizing God. For that one should take out some time on daily basis to practice devotion.
I really loved the way he explained about spirituality in this DVD. His real time examples, his messages Swamiji's ability to explain in a way that most everyone can relate to are second to none. In this DVD, he provides practical advice on what to do to lead a spiritual life being in the materialistic world.
What I like most is that how one can balance the worldly duties while practicing devotion to God. For me it is very important because of running behind the world.
I really loved it. It is a must DVD for each and every family.",1382054400,,1065,4.438775510204081
8539748,5,B009CWWB68,"What can I say about this one, its an awesome creation by Sir Swami Mukundananda. Spirituality explained in the most fashionable way. I mean, its so relating that it breaks the taboo of what the spirituality has been understood so far from the age old time till present day.

Swami ji is sure a divine personality, I can so understand what he is trying to say. Makes me understand every bit of it.
I bow to you in respect and wish I can be more surrendered to your teachings.

Adios.........",1380067200,,491,4.444444444444445
8539749,5,B009CWWB68,"This is a wonderful introductory video that highlights on spirituality and our search for happiness.  The speaker, Swami Mukundananda, gives a beautiful explanation of how science and spirituality is reconciled in the Vedic scriptures.  A unique, yet simple system of meditation is explained where the mind focuses on God's forms and names while meditating.  Great intro video for sure!",1379980800,2,386,5.508474576271187
8539750,5,B009CWWB68,"Many people are searching for answers to basic questions of life - 1) Why do we need spirituality in our life? 2) Can spiritual science and material science co-exist? 3) What is our ultimate goal? 4) Why do we all ultimately desire happiness? 5) Can we balance spirituality and our worldly duties?

Look no further. Swami Mukundananda, in this DVD - Introduction to Spirituality, explains very simply and elegantly the answers to the above questions and more. It is very difficult to find information on spirituality, which is both authentic and simple to understand. In my experience, many other speakers and authors explain spirituality in a complicated manner with incorrect or half-correct information, which only leads to confusion and distrust. That is not the case when you hear what Swami Mukundananda has said in this DVD. Your heart will instantly accept and be thrilled with everything that he says in this DVD. Your doubts will be clarified upon listening to this DVD. This DVD builds a solid foundation upon which one can pursue the path of spirituality as an everyday goal/activity of life. The knowledge given in this DVD is based on the ancient Vedas and other divine scriptures of Sanatan Vedic Dharm (Hinduism). It is a great tribute to Swami Mukundananda that he can explain this ancient knowledge in a manner that we all can comprehend.

I request everyone to take some time out of their busy lives to watch this DVD. Time and money spent will be more than worthwhile. You will notice a fundamental change in your life, for the better, after watching this DVD.",1378944000,3,1580,4.891791044776119
