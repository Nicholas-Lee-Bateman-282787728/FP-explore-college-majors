7955754,5,B00005V1XN,"This film about Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion is great fun, especially if you fantasize about being the ruler of that famous home. This is actually quite a sedate, documentary-type look at the overall life at the mansion, showing not only scenes of the ladies and fun parties there, but also an extensive amount about the various parts of the home, the business activities of the company, the history of Playboy, many comments from relevant people, and the like.

While the focus here is not on getting to see the sexy ladies in the buff, there is a lot more of that on this film than on A & E's edited broadcast. Also, if you wonder why there are two different covers sold for this DVD, one of Hef with some of the ladies, and another showing the mansion, I've seen the DVDs from both, and as far as I have noticed they are identical.

For more on the ladies at the mansion, you might try the videos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playboy-Mansion-Parties-Totally-Uncensored/dp/B000068TPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playboy - Mansion Parties Totally Uncensored</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playboy-Mansion-Parties-Hottest-Moments-Body-Painting/dp/B00006JU7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playboy - Mansion Parties, Hottest Moments & Body Painting</a>&nbsp;I like seeing ""Inside the Playboy Mansion,"" then one of the two I just mentioned for a ""behind the scenes"" look.

7955756,3,B00005V1XN,"I think that this movie and the other one just like it (""Playboy 2000 - The Party Continues"") are supposed to be additions and updates to the old documentary about Hugh Hefner (""Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time"").  All of the movies talk about the history of Hefner and Playboy.  The ""Once Upon a Time"" movie concluded with Hefner married, the other movie, ""2000 -The Party Continues"", goes over more of the History of Playboy plus how Hefner started the parties back up after he seperated from his wife.  This movie is the most up to date.  It talks about what Hef does in the Mansion (wwith his multiple girlfriends) recently.
This movie is pretty interesting, it gives you a nice glimpse into the mansion and into what Hef does these days, but I did have a couple of complaints. The main thing that I didn't like is that the original ""Once Upon a Time"" movie talked about the good times and the bad times. This movie just talks about the good times. The other thing is that a good part of this movie just goes over what the other two movies covered before.  This movie is about 90 minutes, but it probably only has about 30 minutes of content not seen in the other two movies.
If you're interested in the history of Hef and Playboy, this movie is a good rental. It's only worth watching once though, I wouldn't say it's worth buying. (Actually, you might be able to catch it on the ""A & E"" cable channel.  I first saw it shown on that channel).  Then watch the other two movies as well (especially ""Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time""). If you're looking for a Playboy movie with Playmates dancing around naked, there's very little of that in this movie. Look elsewhere.",1030924800,15,1665,4.439344262295082
