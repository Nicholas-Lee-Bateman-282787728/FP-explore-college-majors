7895642,3,6305805067,Two old movies. grainy. but ok,1474416000,,30,4.166666666666667
7895643,4,6305805067,"I bought this because of the movie ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Of the several movies with this theme, all the reviews counted this as the best even though it was the first. After seeing ""Hard Target"", I looked in ernest and found this. Both movies are good and interesting for film buffs like myself. ""The Vampire Bat"" is a good movie, too; but TMDG stands out. Of note is the fact that it uses most of the cast and the same sets as the original ""King Kong"". Both films are well worth the viewing.",1262822400,,496,4.287234042553192
7895644,2,6305805067,"Both movies are a very good addition to any classic or horror movie  collection. This disk, however, is not! The video transfer is supposedly  ""restored"", but you would never know it. The Most Dangerous Game  was watchable, but certain scenes were very washed out with lots of dirt  and scratches. I had even worse success with The Vampire Bat. The movie  started ok, but my DVD player actually had trouble reading the disk about  mid-way through. It got so bad, that I had to stop watching the movie. If  your main interest in this disk is, The Most Dangerous Game (by far the  superior of the two films), then I suggest the Criterion release.",968198400,8,644,4.587719298245614
7895645,3,6305805067,"Well, if there is a catch, it's the picture quality. Althoughthe DVD states that the films have been 'digitally remastered fromsources provided by National Film Museum', all that really proves is that the prints held by National Film Museum aren't that good. They picture quality is what you might charitably describe as 'mediocre' - not awful, not great, merely OK.  The print for 'The Most Dangerous Game' is a bit grainy with slightly too much contrast and on-screen motion appears blurred instead of crisp. 'The Vampire Bat' is shown in a sort of greyish / light blue tint. As this is the first version I've seen, I can't say if it's supposed to be like this.  What I do know is that my Leonard Maltin Movie Guide bills 'The Vampire Bat' as lasting 71 minutes with the warning 'beware of shorter prints'.  Guess what folks? This version only lasts 61 minutes...so I assume this is one of the shorter prints Leonard Maltin refers to.
So why have I given the DVD three stars? Well, despite the shortcomings and a lack of special features, this is still over two hours worth of the wonderful Fay Wray. Both films provide cracking entertainment - especially 'The Most Dangerous Game' - at a fairly reasonable price. The sound quality is fine and like I say, the picture quality is not completely terrible.
Finally, in case you didn't already know, 'The Most Dangerous Game' is also available on the 'Criterion' range of DVDs. For a few dollars more you'll find a much better print of the film and their DVD also features a movie commentary. So, if you're only interested in 'The Most Dangerous Game', I strongly recommend you check out the Criterion DVD instead.",964396800,17,1662,4.724137931034483
7895646,2,6305805067,"These two golden age horror films are done a gross disservice by E-Biz's DVD pressing.  Ostensibly struck from 35mm original elements from The National Museum (whoever they are!), what we are given in reality is a  scratchy, overly-bright and, most unforgiveably, OUT OF FOCUS, copy of  ""Most Dangerous Game""!  My public domain Beta copy from 15 years  ago looks better than this! The soundtrack is equally poor, filled with  loud hiss. ""The Vampire Bat"" fares slightly better; this copy  looks no worse than the old pd-videotape copies.  At least it's in focus  throughout.  But this print is NOT complete.  My old tape copy runs almost  three-minutes longer. My advice is to avoid this disc.  ""Game"" is  also available on Criterion, so that's the one to buy.  This is  ""Bat's"" DVD debut, so stick with any of the numerous acceptable  tape copies until somebody gets it right on DVD.",962928000,9,884,4.864864864864865
7895647,3,6305805067,"If you like Fay Wray then you will like these. The 1st film ""Most  dangerous game"" is not bad. A madman hunts people down like animals on  his Island and Fay Wray becomes one of the hunted. The only bad thing is  that the picture quality is not the best but probobly due to the orig  print.  Also, the madman (hunter) character is a little campy.  The 2nd  movie i actually enjoyed more.  The story is not as strong but the actors  are good. The Vampire Bat!!  This movie is complete with decent atmosphere  and the townsfolk running scared of so called Vampires or something.  It  turns out its Lionel Atwill playing a mad doctor taking the blood of the  people for his experiments. Fay Wray is in typical good form as always.  The picture quality is clearer in this movie but it has some junk in the  picture but that was expected since these are 1930's films. Enjoy!",962582400,2,869,4.371069182389937
7895648,2,6305805067,"Film was actually shot at Universal outdoor lot, and interior of Atwill's home was supposedly used in The Old Dark House(which is excellent!).This film icludes Melvyn Douglas, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye. Too bad that the  cast can't help this slow and talky production. I never did understand,  exactly, what Atwill's character was trying to do! This was made by Majestic  Pictures which sounds like the 1930s version of Monogram studios! This is  pretty much lame, low-budget fare. I am a die-hard fan of the genre and  would own a copy just to say I have it, but I would never watch it  again(once was enough! ).Watch Mark of the Vampire as it is much better and  includes Bela.",962323200,,679,4.65546218487395
