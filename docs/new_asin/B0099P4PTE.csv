8538074,1,B0099P4PTE,"Very disappointing production sold by BBC Shop, because the sub titles are DUTCH! Neither English nor German.",1430956800,2,109,5.470588235294118

8538076,1,B0099P4PTE,Beware! This set is in GERMAN or DUTCH!!! Unless you look closely you would not know it from the listing. I sent this as a gift and was horrified that it couldn't be used or watched. The listing should clearly state that it is a GERMAN/DUTCH version and can't be played on American DVD players.,1418083200,7,294,4.363636363636363
8538077,4,B0099P4PTE,Amazing service. Hard to believe how quickly it arrived. All in good condition. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that the individual DVDs were not consistently marked and it was hard to see what order they should be watched in. Ultimately this did not affect our viewing. I would buy from this seller with confidence any time.,1393632000,,338,4.557377049180328
