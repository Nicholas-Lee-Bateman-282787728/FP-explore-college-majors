2583277,4,B000FS9MUQ,"The cartoons of the 90's have really been either great, or not as side-splitting as they've claimed to be. For Disney and Warner Brothers, they've each tried to duke it out with the best in animation. Disney was as creative with conjuring spin-offs from their classic cartoons from Goof Troop, which included Goofy and Pete, and Tailspin which came about as a knockoff from Baloo and his days from The Jungle Book. For another cartoon, Darkwing Duck, it was one of the enjoyable cartoon series Disney had ever developed. The spinoof from Ducktales, a previous Disney series became one of the most unique cartoon shows ever, and celebreating its 15th anniversary on television. Now, the terror that flapped thorugh the night is now on home video.

Darkwing Duck Volume 1, is a reflection of Drake Mallard and his universe around him, as Darkwing Duck, a super sleuth with a ego as big as his mind. The DVD set contains 25 great episodes that have made him a undergound legend. The set includes so many grat episodes from Comic Book Capers, where Darkwing rejects an idea for a comic book series about himself, and he decided to make it himself against Mega Volt, with some disaterous distractions eluding him. There is also Darkly Dawns The Duck Parts 1 & 2, the two episodes that brought him against Taurus Bulba, one of his first foes. Along the way, he meets Launchpad McQuack, a pilot from Duck Tales, who decides to tag along, and become his sidekick, and his adopted daughter Gosalyn Waddlemeier, who lost her original father early in her life. Along the way, he learns to get along with Gosalyn, and tells him asecret code to a dangerous ramrod laser. There also is Duck Blind, where Darkwing tries to adapt to being blind and his crimefighting surroundings after being injured in a terrible accident, and tries to tackle Mega Volt from stealing lights all around the city.

All in all, Darkwing Duck is still one of my favorite guilty pleasure cartoon that Disney had ever developed. This is a great DVD purchase for anyone who hasn't seen these great cartoons, and for die hard Darkwing Duck fans too. I just wish there could've been more episodes that were highlighted like My Ghoulish Valentine, and Negaduck. Hopefully, if another volume hits DVD, those episodes can be included.

2583278,5,B000FS9MUQ,"After Disney revived afternoon 'toon TV with Ducktales, there quickly followed a host of great shows featuring revamped Disney characters. These included Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers, TaleSpin and this witty, thoughtful, excellently-written series.

Launchpad McQuack carried over from DuckTales, and amazingly, when you thought that show had used up every duck-related joke possible, Darkwing Duck unleashed a fury of malapropisms and wacky slogans. But DD was a flawed human, or rather mallard, and long before the retooled Batman he was a conflicted crime fighter. Add in his inability to understand Gosalyn and the wild card of Launchpad, and you have a cartoon departure from the standard superhero formula that fans absolutely loved while for other viewers the show fell flat.

That would lead to Disney's taking animation risks in its TV shorts that would lift afternoon 'toons to a higher level of interest and complexity. The high point in experimenting was probably Raw Toonage, which launched both Marsupilami (from a Belgian comic) and Here's Bonkers, loosely based on Roger Rabbit. The overwhelming response probably enabled Disney Channel (and Toon Disney) to nearly reinvent the cartoon as an artform with Kim Possible, deviate from cookie cutter formulas with such 'toons as Lloyd in Space and Teacher's Pet, and return to the fast, frenzied, funny 'toon in Brandy and Mr. Whiskers.

Disney's attempt to translate feature animation to TV series brilliantly succeeded. But the great art and writing all began here in the tales of Duckburg and St. Canard, and ""the terror that flaps by night"".",1155340800,9,1609,5.301960784313725
2583279,4,B000FS9MUQ,"Let's Get dangerous indeed Elizabeth!! Somwhere some villian schemes, but there numbers' up. He is the terror that flaps in the night. He is Darkwing Duck!!! And he finally has his own DVD boxed set. This was my favorite of all the classic Disney shows, (with Chip 'n' Dale in very close second. in fact I just picked that one up and am really enjoying it as well.), and can't wait to get a copy of it. Darkwing had the catchiest theme song and the craziest villains including: Megavolt, Bushroot, Steelbeak, The Liquidater, and Darkwing's evil twin Negaduck. Basically this was Disney's equivilant of Batman with a comedic twist. You also have to love Darkwing's costume, I always liked that hat.",1155340800,7,697,4.768595041322314
2583280,5,B000FS9MUQ,"And it's about time, too! This was definitely one of Disney's better shows in the early/mid-90s. Both kids and adults can get a good laugh out of this show and the humor should hold up well over the years, nothing too dated.

I hear that there won't be any extras in this set, but for the chance to finally get hold of this series, I'm more than willing to forgive that. Especially when there's also supposed to be captioning, surround sound and decent artwork on the packaging. Disney also apparently learned their lesson with previous DVD series releases and this time they're including the pilot. Only the first 25 eps of season 1, though, so hopefully the second half will be along soon.

The first 25 eps (and pilot) as follows:

Darkly Dawns the Duck 1&2

Beauty and the Beat

Getting Antsy

Night of the Living Spud

Apes of Wrath

Dirty Money

Duck Blind

Comic Book Capers

Waterway to Go

Paraducks

Easy Come, Easy Grows

A Revolution in Home Appliances

Trading Faces

Hush, Hush Sweet Charlatan

Can't Bayou Love

Bearskin Thug

You Sweat Your Life

Days of Blunder

Just Us Justice Ducks 1&2

Double Darkwings

Aduckyphobia

When Aliens Collide

Jurassic Jumble

Cleanliness Is Next to Badliness

Smarter Than a Speeding Bullet

There's always hope that the next half of the season will have the extras this one is lacking, but even without that, it's still more than worth the money to finally have Darkwing on DVD.",1148428800,91,1430,4.703252032520325

2583285,5,B000FS9MUQ,"Darkwing Duck was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid and I was happy to have it on DVD. There aren't any extras on the set but that didn't really bother me. The thing that did bother me was that the episodes are out of order and you get to see characters before they're introduced. But the Justice Ducks episodes are on this set but you'll need to buy Volume 2 to see the introduction of some of the characters in it, like Negaduck, Morgana, The Liquidator, and Quackerjack (although Quackerjack does have a episode on this set even though it's not his introduction episode). But for anyone familiar to Darkwing Duck it's not really a problem but if you're someone new to the series you might end up watching this set and wondering who some of the characters are in Justice Ducks since they don't get introduced till later episodes.",1503964800,3,834,4.493421052631579

There's videos of DD on YouTube that are better quality then this, so I KNOW Disney can do better. They just probably won't.

Oh, and forget about getting a Volume 2, apparently Disney doesn't want to sell it to you.

It just contains the episodes, no bonus features or anything, and not even creative menus!

2583312,5,B000FS9MUQ,"The Disney Afternoon, though small, was a big part of my childhood and this show and Talespin were my favorites.  I wasn't allowed to watch the Ninja Turtles, but this show more than made up for that loss.  I enjoy Darkwing's antics plus some superhero references and parodies.  What makes Darkwing interesting was his bumbling antics, his interesting foes (Megavolt was my favorite), his buds and family, his nifty gas gun, and his now immortal catchphrase: ""Let's get Dangerous!""  That line never gets old.  My favorites on this episode were the pilot two-parter, Just us Justice Ducks, and a Revolution in Home Appliances.  This is one of those shows that gets better with age.",1464220800,,680,4.921052631578948

For those growing up in the 90's and watching this awesome, action-packed show, all of the memories and fun can come back by buying Volume 1.  And for those who have never seen it or don't remember it, you can catch how DW met Launchpad and Gosalyn, and the origins of  some of the villains such as Bushroot and Quackerjack.  The show's a must see!!! It's silly, funny, wacky, witty, educational, has morals, is full of action and emotion, and has thrill and excitement!!!!  The characters have the best, fitting voices. Cartoons aren't made like this anymore.  Parents who grew up watching DW and his crazy, unfortunate mishaps can now have their children watch and enjoy the show!!  The only setbacks are that the original opening is cut from episode 1 in the beginning with the criminal chase and there's no title on the main menu.  There's no Darkwing games or previews, and not all of the episodes are released on DVD.  Some of the episodes are out of order.  But it's worth getting if you miss the show and shows just like it.  I highly recommend it!  Not only is the show filled with unbelievably creative characters, the show's music and theme is catchy, lovable, and addicting!!  Darkwing Duck has legendary voice actors, such as Jim Cummings and Dan Castellaneta, that do the voices in the show, which make the cake!

The video and sound quality is very poor and varies from episode to episode. I have some old VHS copies of episodes from this volume that have better sound and picture quality to them. Another thing is that there are absolutely no chapters. Each episode is one large segment, hitting the chapter skip button merely ends the episode and brings you back to the episode selection menu. It resembles a home dvd burning software where you can load home movies into a pre-made menu and ""click"" on them when loaded into a dvd player. This product was viewed on a 720p LCD flatscreen, HDMI cable, and blue ray player. The show is not that old, why was it not remastered first before being put out as a set?

Cover art is so-so & the box art is cool. If you grew up when this used to air after school. And you liked & watched the series, you'll likely still enjoy this!

This could had been a Three volume set and I would had bought all three. Other than that good that Darkwing has come to DVD.

2583445,5,B000FS9MUQ,"I watched both this show and Ducktales religiously as a kid. I could still clearly recall Ducktales even as time passed, and I ordered all three volumes as soon as they were available. Darkwing, however, I didn't remember as well, until he showed up in my recommendations list.
I bought this on a leap of faith and popped disc one into my DVD player the day it arrived, only intending to watch the first episode.
I ended up watching the entire set.
How could I have forgotten you, D.W.?
I now proudly call Darkwing Duck my favorite superhero, never mind the weird looks and questions regarding my sanity that might arise.
In my opinion, nothing currently on TV holds up against this show's comedic yet truly dangerous adventures, eclectic rogue's gallery, and sense of family. Gosalyn is not the typically portrayed, ""What do you care, you're not my father!"" adopted child. At the end of the pilot episode ( my favorite, by the way; the lullaby scene is especially sweet), Darkwing is her dad, and that's all there is to it. Launchpad adds the element of sidekick/brother/unofficial uncle, and between the three of them, the criminal element of St. Canard doesn't stand a chance. I strongly recommend this set if you're looking to recapture the Disney Afternoon. Even if, like me, you don't remember him too well, give Darkwing a shot. You just might find yourself getting dangerous.",1298419200,2,1383,4.815126050420168

I highly recommend this series for either your children, for yourself, or for you to watch with your children.  For some reason, it makes me think of this as a kind of Batman series but with Ducks. lol  I guess it's the cape he wears. =)",1296172800,,526,4.21

2583459,5,B000FS9MUQ,"Darkwing Duck was coolest cartoon I ever watched as a kid.  So I think it's awesome that Disney has begun to release the episodes on DVD.  For those of you who are new to this cartoon, good for you for finding this page!  There are so many things that make Darkwing Duck stand out among past and present cartoons.  For examples, the hero is a single parent to an adopted daughter, his girlfriend is a reformed criminal sorceress, the sidekick is a crossover from another oldschool cartoon, one of the bad guys is a Disney version of The Joker, and the top antagonist is a crazy chainsaw-wielding doppelganger of the hero (and probably the most psychotic villain ever created by Disney).  It has been 18 or 19 years since the last time I sat down and watched Darkwing Duck, and I have to say that I appreciate the witty, hilarious scriptwriting more now as an adult.  All those ""I am the terror that flaps in the night"" lines I didn't understand when I was little now make a ton of comical sense!

For those of you who are old fans of Darkwing Duck, go ahead and buy this volume.  Be aware, though, that there are no special features and the episodes are organized according to when they were aired, rather than when they were produced.  FYI for anyone concerned about minor editing: ""Darkly Dawns the Duck Part 1"" leaves out the opening chase scene, which is a pity since it was quite thrilling, but you can probably google it.  Don't be discouraged by these negative aspects, though.  At least Darkwing Duck has been extracted from the vortex of almost-forgotten Disney cartoons, so buy it while it's available...before it goes out of print.  Relive the adventure and humor of this beloved show.  I am sure you'll find it funnier now than as a kid.",1288656000,5,1749,4.5495207667731625

2583461,5,B000FS9MUQ,"My all-time favorite show! This is an animated Disney cartoon about a masked crime fighter by night and adoptive father by day.  He has a dim-witted, but large-hearted side-kick (Launchpad, originally from Tales Spin), and his energetic tom-boy of a daughter is constantly trying to join in the action.  It's witty and adds relationships to the mix, even with the villians at times.

Volume 1 includes 27 of the episodes in the series.  Many of my favorites are on it, but many more are on volume 2, and even MORE have not been released! [...] to BEG them to release the rest of the series, PLEASE! There are still 37 more episodes, including my all-time favorite, the Quiverwing Quack!

2583463,4,B000FS9MUQ,"Of all the Disney franchises my favorite has to be Duck Tales. Many people think that Duck Tales was merely an 80s TV show and never went further than Saturday morning but in reality it has a very rich history going back decades and if you think that it spoofs Indiana Jones you'd be wrong because it's actually the other way around.

Darkwing Duck was a spin-off of Duck Tales, taking place in the same universe but transplanting the action from Duckburg to St. Canard. The only regular returning character was bumbling pilot Launchpad McQuack but he was my favorite, though Gizmoduck does make a couple of appearances.

Darkwing himself, ordinary Drake Mallard by day, is a sort of cross between Batman, The Scarlet Pimpernel and The Shadow. He's a crime-fighter with absolutely no abilities other than his determination to beat the bad guys though his is utterly confident in himself and craves media attention. With Launchpad as his sidekick and the occasional help from his daughter Goslyn he tackles a variety of strange villains, winning usually by chance.

I've often thought that a hero can only be measured by his nemesis and unfortunately none of the Darkwing Duck bad guys are up to much, but that's fine since Darkwing himself is sort of incompetent. Episodes set during the daytime contradict the noirish nature of the show and the best episodes are the ones set in the shadows and dark alleyways. I know that this is a kids show and is not necessarily in the same league as the Batman animated series but it does seem to be selling itself short in this regard. Duck Tales frequently had very dynamic and imaginative stories while Darkwing Duck is sort of hit-and-miss. That's my only complaint though.

Darkwing Duck still has loads going for it, including a brilliant theme song and his memorable signature catchphrase 'Let's get dangerous' (or 'It's gonna get scary big-time' as they say in France). There still life in this bird yet and with the Scrooge McDuck universe still popular to this day then we might just see him return some time.

The DVD features a 1.33:1 full frame transfer for every episode as originally drawn with stereo sound. It's from a video source so it's not too sharp but it won't really bother any serious fans. There are no extras whatsoever.",1220313600,4,2286,4.791878172588833
2583464,5,B000FS9MUQ,"This, along with many of the other Disney Afternoon shows, was a favorite of mine as a child.  So, when I discovered it was on dvd I knew I had to buy it.

I will admit I was hesitant about purchasing the dvd, I had been disappointed by other old favorite shows before (the old TMNT toon, Power Rangers, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch just to name a few) thankfully, this one didn't disappoint.

This show still retains it's magic!

The pilot (despite being cut and edited into a two-parter for syndication) was a wonder to watch.  Funny, serious, and dramatic, it's a great start to a great show.  (I do highly recommend getting the ""Darkly Dawns the Duck"" vhs, which is the uncut movie version of the pilot, if you can).

The other episodes, although not always as serious as the pilot was at times, are still just as wonderfully enjoyable.

Maybe it is a generational thing, but I am just not as crazy for Darkwing Duck as the other series.

2583479,4,B000FS9MUQ,"Recent conversation I had with a friend -

Me: It really was the best show ever.  Sadly, I haven't been able to bring myself to watch the rest of that DVD I got of the first season.  I was so angry that they had put the edited version of the first episode on the DVD.  I mean sheesh!  I have the unedited version on the original video release.  What were they thinking of?  Don't they think that people who buy the show do so because they actually want to see it as it was?
Friend: What the hell? Why do they edit all the shows on DVDs these days? ... Way to promote illegal distribution by driving people to P2P networks for the original versions.

I love this show, I really do.  I was on the list to be informed when it came out on DVD, and the minute Amazon e-mailed re: its availability I placed my order.  I was so excited when it came.  The minute it arrived I popped it in and watched the two-part pilot episode.

I haven't touched it since.  I was so disheartened at the cuts that had been made (the entire opening chase sequence and assorted gags and dialogue throughout), I didn't have the heart to go back to it and be disappointed again.

I don't know *why* the cuts were made.  I doubt it was to tone down any cartoon violence as other equally ""violent"" moments were left in.  I suspect these were edits that were made when the show was actually still on the air, edits made due to time considerations and for more commercial space.  However, the full footage should have been restored and included when Disney decided to release the show on DVD.

I don't want to be negative.  I wouldn't have reviewed except that, looking at what people have written, I see that no one has mentioned the edits.  Younger viewers, people who didn't see the show when it first came out or who didn't watch it on video, many not even be aware.  Still, fans should know that the show has been tampered with before they buy it.

5 stars for the original television show, but 3 stars for the DVD release.",1184284800,88,1996,4.280748663101604
2583480,5,B000FS9MUQ,"I'm so surprised at how many other reviewers in all age groups have praised this show -- and most deservingly too! I hope Tad Stones realizes how many fans he's generated for this short-lived cartoon series -- even recently with the DVD releases!

I didn't start getting ""hooked"" on it until January 1992 [I was 22 then], but while it was on I watched I religiously! It was on for a few years & then it seemed to just 'disappear' from tv. I hoped they would've made more episodes, but it [like the other ""Disney Afternoon"" shows then] seemed to be a limited production to begin with.

The humour & especially the dialogue in this series took me by surprise -- VERY FUNNY & WELL DONE!

Back to the present [now I'm 38!], I'm still watching the first DVD [since I didn't even KNOW about this release until June 2007!] and it's SO nice, SO fun to see these again, with the best sound & picture quality this show can offer.

I really enjoy the ""French"" soundtracks too. I don't speak it myself, but it's like watching these for the first time AND you learn a little of the language! They changed his name to ""Mister Mask"" for this version.

Anyways, this is one of the BEST cartoon shows from the early 1990s era & one of the BEST tv shows [animated or live action!] ever made -- my opinion -- and it's nice to have on a DVD set.

2583481,4,B000FS9MUQ,"In these days of Super Heroes overload, this series is well timed to appear on DVD.

Less famous than Ducktales and Rescue Rangers, this show was certainly better than the latter and sometimes rivalled the former.

Criticised at the time for featuring a hero with a gun (it was the too-PC '90s), the fact that DW's weapons all shot grappling hooks, whipped cream etc. was missed by the nay-sayers.

Playing like Batman with webbed feet, this show was saved from cliche (obliviously incompitant hero) by a great set of support characters (not least of which was DuckTales' own Launchpad McQuack) and villians. The fact that Daffy Duck is currently playing the same sort of role in CN's Duck Dodgers shows athat the formula works.

What irritates about this and all of the current wave of Disney animated TV DVD releases is the lack of extras. All stand up well even now (the already mentioned DuckTales and Rescue Rangers, as well as Gummi Bears and Tailspin) and are great for people of my age to relive their 'Disney Afternoons'. However, even Warners are putting minimal extras on their equivalent Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain Discs and a few featurettes on the vopice talent or animation process would be nice.

The release of this show and Tailspin suggests that lesser entries such as The Wuzzles (remember them?!), Quack Pack, and Bonkers Bobcat may see DVD rebirth before long.",1180483200,4,1390,4.848101265822785

A definate spoof on all things superhero but...if you have ever watched the old Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes you will recognize a lot of spoofed moments from those as well.

This collection features 25 episodes and the pilot though I don't see how they can be the first 25 when the introduction episodes for several characters are missing.  I was disapointed that there was no The Liquidator episodes until the last disc when you get to the ""Justice Ducks"" episodes which was not in the first season but which is included here.  I am not complaining about its inclusion, it has been my favorite Darkwing Duck episode since I was fifteen years old.

The quality of the DVD's is good, with good audio as well.  There are no features at all which has been a disapointment with all of the old Disney Afeternoon releases.  The episodes could have at least been released in chronological order to make up for the lack of commentary, or animators and writers talking about the series, as was done with Gargoyales

2583509,4,B000FS9MUQ,"It is often said a program or movie is as good as the villains it depicts, which is even more so the case with animation. I believe the statement is true and the greatest evidence I can present is Darkwing Duck. The cartoon is Disney's parody of the superhero/spy genre. It is a crazy and comedic combination of everything from Batman to Bond (the two series' which of course had the best and most colourful of villains) and so Darkwing Duck retains that colour and gives us such masterpieces as Steelbeak, Quackerjack, Megavolt, Bushroot and Darkwing's own inversion, his nemesis Negavolt.

However, the true beauty of this show is that the heroes are just as entertaining as the villains (as opposed to Disney's Aladdin series in which the villains truly steal the show leaving Aladdin and Jasmine for broke wondering aimlessly through the viewer's eyes and sadly falling into the dismal abyss of 'forgetability'). Darkwing is surprisingly capable... and only really undone by his own ego. Gosalyn also is a fantasic creation and the interaction between the two is actually touching and dare I say... meaningful. But of course this is not why you will watch the show, it is only an added bonus.

You will watch it because it will bring you back the nostalgic warmth of yester-year when Disney ruled supreme and 2D animation still had the guts to stand its ground. You will watch it because it will bring you laughter and joy (even if temporary). You will watch it because when you wake up on a Saturday morning with remote control in hand, after spending an hour of channel surfing you will find that there is nothing better to watch. Period.

Oh and special features... there aren't any... but if that really bothers you then perhaps you are watching the show for the wrong reasons.",1167868800,5,1785,4.770226537216828
2583510,4,B000FS9MUQ,"Caped  crime fighter Darkwing Duck is Disney's version of Batman with the Shadow's cape and hat thrown in. St. Canard is really a disney version of Gotham City.  Sidekick Launchpad (from Ducktale) is Darkwing's Robin. His daughter Gosalyn is like ward Dick Greyson...Think niece Penny of Gadget fame

However REMEMBER this is Disney,  so the hero blunders. Think Inspector Gadget with a cape...Think Batman with an over cute superhero.

However, this animated Duck is funny stuff for kids and adults alike. Think campy Batman of the 1960's with Disney-ness throw in. It has satire that the adults can watch with a kids viewpoint.

The 27 episodes three disk set (including its two episode) pilot is fine TV animation

It is worth it alone for the great satire. It is something both kids and adults can enjoy

2583511,5,B000FS9MUQ,"The streets of St. Canard are filled with danger.  Villains lurk behind every corner.  But thanks to Darkwing Duck, criminals of all stripes are arrested every day.  By day, he's Drake Mallard, suburban Dad raising his adopted daughter, Gosalyn.  But by night, he's the costumed crime fighter who, assisted by his sidekick Launchpad McQuack, taking on such super villains as Bushroot, Megavolt, and Steelbeak in an effort to keep his city safe.

Of course, Darkwing has his weaknesses.  He has no real super powers, but does have lots of nifty gadgets that help him fight crime.  His real problem is his ego.  He loves to make flashy entrances and is shocked each time a villain outsmarts him.  Flattery will distract him in a second.  And he even narrates his adventures - as they are happening.

There is certainly plenty of danger in these episodes.  Darkwing looses his sight and must rely on the help of others to fight crime.  An evil alien lands on Earth, and Gosalyn thinks it's a pet.  Home appliances start coming to life and terrorizing the city.  Someone is knocking over banks, literally.  And the evil Quackerjack tries to convince Darkwing that he was born to serve tea, not be a crime fighter.

The series is obviously a spoof on superheroes and owes much of its form to Batman.  Still, there are other comic influences here, and I'm sure someone with a better knowledge of that genre could identify them.  Between the villains and the occasional alien, there's also a strong science fiction element.  I got into the show for the humor.  Not only are there the normal cartoon hits, whacks, and smashes, but there are lots of great puns in everything from the titles to the dialog.

This set includes the pilot and the first 25 regular episodes of the show aired.  Unfortunately, they aired in a different order from the order completed so all continuity is lost.  There are no extras on the set.  The picture looks good but not outstanding.  The stereo soundtrack is wonderful, however.

Although I've outgrown that, watching the series makes me appreciate I grew up during a time when cartoons didn't contain gross-out humor or cater to kids with low attention spans or taste.

There's no need to describe the show. Those of us who grew up with it should remember it. Hopefully today's kids will be able to watch these and like them just as much as I did back in the day.

And yes, there's no bonus features and a possibly edited pilot. But again, as I've said with the Talespin set, who cares?!?

Insted of collecting the episodes in the order that they were made they are in the order that the negligent programing staff at disney aired them. So it's realy hard to fallow the continuty of the show in it's current state which is verry anoying.

The ""pilot"" episode isn't the original that aired; this is the version that has been aired practically ever since, with the clipped opening chase, and a few other shorter scenes.  A huge disappointment to say the least, seeing as they managed to put the uncut pilot on VHS.  So though we've been told the pilot is included, it's not in its entirety.

The artwork on the box and thinpaks is strange, as some of the clips are from episodes not included (disc three's inclusion of a scene from ""Brush With Oblivion"" comes to mind), and the menus are rather odd pastiche of various characters clipped from different episodes.  Still, A for effort.

What would be nice for the next release is the choice of the original extended Saturday morning opening or the current opening for seasons two and three.  I haven't seen it since the original airing in '91, and I doubt many people even remember it.  As well, let's hope they include ""Hot Spells!""",1156809600,13,972,4.710059171597633
