8689676,4,B00PX7STMQ,"This movies reminds me of a shorter darker version of Peyton Place minus it's wonderful New England locals.  Change out the sparkly eyed seductress character (Terry Moore) for the wide brown eyed innocence of Sandra Dee and you have the Restless Years.  Like Peyton Place, The Restless Years makes a foray into the mores and and mentality of a small town.  Dee's mother, played by Teresa Wright, is the self professed unstable widow and mother of Dee who seems to live in years gone by. Her need to dress her daughter like a child instead of the older high school student she really is seems to perpetuate her need to stay frozen in time.  Dee plays Melinda Grant who is painfully aware of what the town thinks of her mother and wants nothing but to stay quietly in the background. She is even more surprised and reluctant to have caught the attention of new comer Will Henderson played by John Saxon.  Henderson has his own family saga being played out as his father (James Whitmore) struggles to make a living and to attain the respect of his wife. He wants nothing from his son but to date and marry someone of importance that will aide him in his work.  When Saxon falls for the towns ""fallen women's"" daughter, Dee issues of teenage jealousy run wild and turn the town and the life of Dee and Saxon upside down.  NOTE: This movie was filmed in black and white.  Although others have commented on the quality of the movie on the disk, my copy ran just fine. I did notice that the 4K television helped to upgrade that quality.  I've noticed that with many older movies - better picture quality all around.",1453852800,4,1608,4.517241379310345

8689680,4,B00PX7STMQ,". . . and the young people it tries to corrupt! If that tag line alone brings to mind images of ""Peyton Place"" (1957), you're not alone. However, ""The Restless Years"", is less known than the aforementioned film, but it deserves more recognition for its talented cast. John Saxon, Sandra Dee, Teresa Wright, James Whitmore, Margaret Lindsay, Luana Patten, Jody McCrea and Virginia Grey all did a decent job of portraying folks of a small town, beset by gossip and whispers. More intimate than ""Peyton Place"" but obviously shot on a lower budget (black and white CinemaScope), this effort is memorable in its own right. Sandra Dee, in only her second film, shows considerable promise as a dramatic actress, as she would demonstrate in later efforts such as ""A Summer Place"" and ""Imitation Of Life"" (both 1959). John Saxon, with just a few movies under his belt, already was displaying the intensity that he later became famous for.

Produced by Ross Hunter, the film seems tame by today's standards but is very entertaining and true to the emotions that ran at the time. It's truly a 50s melodrama, and that's really where the entertainment value lies.

Just recently, ""The Restless Years"" made its debut on DVD in the Universal Vault Series Collection. Unfortunately, the print is in non-anamorphic widescreen, a grave disappointment. Universal could and should do better.

John Saxon and Sandra Dee were a fine screen team, and also displayed this in two other films, ""The Reluctant Debutante"" (1958) and ""Portrait In Black"" (1960).",1424390400,9,1532,5.0
8689681,4,B00PX7STMQ,"This is a great Ross Hunter production of a Helmut Kautner directed 1959 Universal film that definitely deserves a better presentation, however, the edition is the Universal Vault Series and is priced at over $20.00 making it palatable for customers to expect the film to be presented in Blu-ray instead of this murky transfer for this smaller than normal Hunter production yet in Cinemascope and black-and-white.  ""The Restless Years"" stars Hunter regulars like Sandra Dee and John Saxon (paired again later in ""Portrait in Black"") and Virginia Grey and features performances by Teresa Wright, James Whitmore and Margaret Lindsay and with future notable players like Luana Patton and Jody McCrea.  Screenplay by Edward Anhalt is based on the play ""Teach Me How to Cry.""  This film is definitely a fifties product with suds flying in a tale of illegitimacy and small town gossip presented as Ross Hunter could in the age of ""Peyton Place"" and pre-dating Delmar Daves' ""A Summer Place"" and other such films.  The really sad truth is that the film deserves to get Blu-ray treatment.",1423267200,5,1080,5.050561797752809
8689682,3,B00PX7STMQ,This is a really good movie with an excellent cast but Universal Vault Series has released it in non-anamorphic widescreen. If you zoom the CinemaScope image to fill the screen the picture looks defused and blurry. The only way to watch it with a decent picture is to window box it in the center of your screen. The smaller image looks okay but still not great. This movie deserves better but I guess I should just be happy it was released on DVD. Four star movie with a two star transfer = three stars.,1421366400,8,503,4.361702127659575
8689683,3,B00PX7STMQ,"Great to see ANY release of this rare Hollywood outing by German director Helmut Kautner. It's great 50's melodrama a la Douglas Sirk with an interesting cast - Theresa Wright, Sandra Dee and John Saxon are always fun to watch.  How Universal could release a flat widescreen NON-ANAMORPHIC old transfer in the digital age is sad and incomprehensible - but at least the film is now out there.  Just don't expect a great transfer.",1420156800,5,428,4.77027027027027
