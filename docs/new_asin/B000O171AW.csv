2789487,5,B000O171AW,"I love this program!! I love that now I can watch them all the time. I actually had to rewatch Season 1 again because I realised that I actually had seen some the eps of sequence origially. I love the Rising pts 1 & 2. I love the Hide and Seek one of the very first eps after Rising. I love the Sheppard and McKay moments. Dr. Beckett is a hoot in this one. I even have my 8 yr. old niece hooked on Stargate Atlantis. What can I say, she has excellent taste!! It is a product that is worth every bit of your money. I have to say, even if you are not a fan of the show, the pilot episode alone it worth it. You almost forget that it is a television program. The production value and special fx's are worth it. Now, we are obsessed. We can not get enough of Stargate Atlantis.",1178928000,,774,3.9363057324840764
2789488,5,B000O171AW,I found both season of Stargate Atlantis to be excellent. It is safe to say that it will continue to bring great stories like the Stargate series.,1178668800,,146,4.444444444444445
2789489,5,B000O171AW,"Stargate atlantis is going to be just as great of a show as stargate. It is to bad they are canceling stargate sg-1, but the spinoff is just as good.",1178668800,,149,4.0
2789490,5,B000O171AW,"I love Stargate and the spin off Atlantis-they were both fun and new.  This series was especially good, with great characters (I love Rodney) and good scripts.  The dvd set has all the episodes and the pilot so you don't need to buy that one seperately.  The transfer is really good, too, clear and sharp.",1176854400,8,305,4.509090909090909
2789491,4,B000O171AW,"I was turned on to this series by a friend and I love it.  Thanks to her, I ordered the first two seasons and will be ordering season 3 shortly!",1194393600,,144,3.8
2789492,5,B000O171AW,"If you haven't figured out by now that the Stargate series was the greatest and now it's been improved upon with the SG Atlantis series you need to just buy it and watch it.

You'll understand after the first DVD.",1193270400,,213,4.325
2789493,5,B000O171AW,I have never been a fan of Stargate SG-1 and felt that it was a poor spin off from the original Stargate; however just watching two episodes of Atlantis completely shocked me and hooked me.  It didn't take long for me to purchase seasons 1 and 2 and left begging for season 3.  I can't wait for season 4.  I strongly recommend purchasing these seasons.,1192060800,,352,4.384615384615385
2789494,5,B000O171AW,"Finally a great spin-off series. I was a little sceptical when they created a spin-off to Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed from the very first episode. They managed to create a new enemy in the wraith, which is nothing like what you've seen in SG-1. This is one of the best sci-fi series ever created. All Stargate and sci-fi fans out there should own a copy of this as well as one of Stargate SG-1.",1188950400,,398,4.25
2789495,5,B000O171AW,"Plain and simple, if you like star trek, stargate sg1 or just good sci-fi you will love this.",1188432000,,93,4.222222222222222
2789496,5,B000O171AW,"My goodness !!! 'Unputdownable' TV. I unfortunately missed the series when it first started in NZ, but was hooked on it when I saw the reruns of Season 1. I love this show. My family love this show. It is not unusual for us to sit and watch 3 episodes in a row. Yes, I know that is sad! I love the acting, the special effects and the general storylines. The Wrath petrify me like the cybermen did in Doctor Who when I was a wee girl. I am waiting somewhat impatiently for Season 3 to arrive on my doorstep. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",1188345600,,529,4.196078431372549
2789497,4,B000O171AW,"If you love adventure, you'll love SG: Atlantis. Although they stumble in spots, this show has been a pleasure to watch, and this package was a great deal. I'm glad I waited.",1186876800,,174,4.46875
2789498,5,B000O171AW,"Fans of Stargate will enjoy this spinoff about a civilian and military operation in another galaxy.  The Lost City of Atlantis used to belong to the Ancients, an advanced human society. Now our new Stargate group has set up base in this ancient city which has one mystery after another to unlock.  Of course, trouble ensues when they encounter the great enemy of the galaxy, the Wraith.  The Wraith feed by clasping their hands against their victims chest and literally suck the life out of them.  This series is darker than Stargate SG-1 but is still engaging and fun.  The best reason to watch is to see David Hewlett who plays Rodney McKay.  McKay is easily the guy you hate to love! If you're a fan of Stargate or just want a good sci-fi action series to watch, this is it!",1184198400,,777,4.475177304964539

I have been a serious fan of Stargate SG1 since the original movie and have collected all 10 season DVD's.  For me this was THE quintessence of  Sci-Fi genre on TV bar none. Due to circumstances beyond my control I was unable to see only a very few of the Altantis series and was not impessed with what I did see.  So it was with a little trepidation that I purchased the first two seasons on DVD.  From what I've seen so far Atantis is just a rehash of the same plot lines used in SG1 only with a new enemy, the Wraith instead of the Goa'uld.  I'm sure if the production company et'al was someone completly different from SG1, there would be lawsuits flying over rampant plagiarism.  I can only hope that the series starts to delve into its own original story lines that things will begin  to gel into another series as good as the one and only SG1.",1183939200,,1061,5.098265895953757
2789500,5,B000O171AW,"Stargate Atlantis is one of the best alien starship series out there.  From the Wraith to the many misadventures of Dr. Mckay and Dr. Beckette, there is plenty of action and comedy for everyone.  Having two seasons together like this is perfect because instead of one great product you get two with this package.",1180742400,,312,4.7592592592592595

8182645,5,B000O171AW,Great DVDs ... Very fast shipping !,1442188800,,35,4.142857142857143
8182646,4,B000O171AW,"The first two season of Stargate Atlantis brought me back to a classic sci-fi feeling.  It isn't dark and bleak, nor is it so engrossed in being real it can't bend any rules.  No, Stargate Atlantis is far more fun, with a bunch of unique characters doing a bunch of fun things.  Its more akin to the original star trek, with a dash of adventure escapism.  I can't think of a more fun show in sci-fi in recent memory.  Give it a try for some fun adventurous sci fi.",1259884800,,464,4.168539325842697
8182647,5,B000O171AW,"My husband got me started on this series, about season 2 I think, very disappointed that it was cancelled.  There is a new Stargate series that as of episode 4 I'm not that keen on, but I'll give it some time.  Anyways, a great series, was easy to pick up on the storyline.  Lots of action, drama and thrills, get seasons 1-5, a great watch!",1255910400,,341,4.2153846153846155
8182648,5,B000O171AW,The best sci-fi I have seen in a LONG time. Perfect for any star trek fan! Great writing and acting!,1213574400,,100,4.05
8182649,2,B000O171AW,"The items arrived on time.  Unfortunately Season 1 DVD was not very good; could not access one of the episodes after many tries.  Season 2 also was difficult to access.  Not too pleased with items, but not Amazon's fault.

8182650,2,B000O171AW,This set was purchased as a Christmas present. It was delivered in a very timely maner but when opened had two season one disk 3 DVDs and no disk 4 DVD. Season two was complete. This is a manufacturing packing fault with the product but spoiled the idea of purchasing a set. I don't believe the DVDs are available for sale separately. The exerience has left me cold on buying sets.,1199404800,,381,4.380281690140845
8182651,5,B000O171AW,"Great fun....  I like the charactors Chemistry and the story line. I never got into the regular Stargate series, it was nothing more than a distraction to me, it was just too hit and miss. I really like the Storyline of this, even tho it spawned from the original series. It has a good story, and some believable enemies, at least for the first few seasons.....",1197936000,,361,4.46969696969697
