8171228,5,B000MRA44S,"This film's subtitle (PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER) belies the depth and intimacy with which Humbert addresses his subject.  Wolfsgrub is the name of the hamlet in Germany where his mother, daughter of the writer Max Mohr, grew up and spent all of her life.  Filmed in simple black and white, filled with striking yet simple images of the surrounding countryside, the house and the subject, it's an extremely effective immersion into the life and history of an inspiringly independent, intelligent and free-thinking woman.  Eva, Humbert's mother, is seen asleep, waking up, washing and combing her hair, going about her daily chores - a practical view of her life which is woven delicately and naturally into her conversation (which is mostly a monologue of remembrance) with her son, which makes up the bulk of the film.  She candidly speaks of her life at Wolfsgrub from the time she was a child to the present, talking openly about her father and mother, their differing personalities and life-requirements, his self-imposed exile to China during WWII, and about growing up during the time of Nazism in Germany.  She relates that her mother was pretty successful in shielding her from the harsh realities of that dark time - the incidents that opened her eyes and mind to the nature of those in charge of the government at the time seem small and ordinary taken out of context, but were both opportune and imperative in altering the course of the human spirit.  More than a feeling of `collective guilt', she speaks of a sense of `collective shame' at what the Nazis wrought on humanity - it caused the eyes of her conscience to open wide, and brought with it a different political view...but in her case, more one of a Gandhi-like `be the change you wish to see in the world' rather than outright political activism.  The sheer openness and honesty with which she speaks of her life, world events, her family, the joys and mistakes she has experienced, her philosophical lack of personal regrets, all make her an unforgettable and admirable human being.

Humbert's images are simple ones - opening sequences depict his journey home, followed by shots of the surrounding area's idyllic setting.  The viewer is left with the feeling that the house - almost as much as his mother - is a living, breathing character.  It has witnessed much in its history, and is an inseparable link to the lives of all who have dwelled within or simply passed through its doors.  The textures of its walls and floors and furnishings are as detailed and defining as the lines on a human's face and hands - there are stories and lessons to be found there, if one will only take the time to look and listen.  The film is personal in a way that few documentaries attempt or accomplish - it's a gentle but complete immersion into the life and history of this remarkable woman, told with grace, easy and beauty.  Humbert's concept and execution, the knowledge, love and respect with which he treats his subject, and the compelling but unobtrusive soundtrack by Fred Firth all combine to make this an unforgettable, enriching experience.",1215388800,,3107,4.828625235404896
