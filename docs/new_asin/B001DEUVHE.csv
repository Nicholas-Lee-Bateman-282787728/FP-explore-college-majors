8293090,5,B001DEUVHE,"I do not have the Blu Ray, but it was the only version appearing here on Amazon, so here goes....I watched it on IFC the other night. Absolutely scorching portrayal of a young man who becomes the leader of the notorious Inter City Firm, the violent band of supporters of English pro club West Ham, set in the '80's. Cass is the name the young man chooses for himself--his Christian name, Carol, being decidedly unmanly--and as a baby he is adopted by an older couple in Penge, East London. As a fan of Brit football, and fascinated by the hooligan culture, I devoured this movie. If you enjoyed or could relate at all to Green Street Hooligans or The Football Factory, you need to see this. And if you enjoy tough films about contemporary, hard-edged London city life, at least from the '80's when hooliganism was at its peak, then you need to see this.

In the heyday of Brit soccer violence, each London club had roving gangs of insanely loyal and bloodthirsty supporters, who, fueled by vast amounts of drugs and alcohol, would beat the living daylights out of rival clubs' supporters. Fists, knives, boots and chains were the primary weapons. Armies of British psychologists and sociologists wrote thousands of books on why this was happening.

Cass served four years in an English prison, got out, got reinvolved with his firm and other unseemly characters. But when he got a girl pregnant and had a child, and after he was shot and recovered, he turned his back on violence and became an author and publisher.

The young man who portrays him as an adult is a man of mountainous physique and talent. This is a truly great film which should be seen by everyone. Americans who are not familiar with East End London dialects will need to watch the film with subtitles.",1295568000,5,1770,4.6485623003194885
