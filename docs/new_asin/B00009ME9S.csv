1883989,5,B00009ME9S,"I can't imagine a DVD set being more complete.  It details his personal life as well as huge amounts of art, and how the two mingle.  With interviews of friends, shots from places made famous (like 4 Cats), and work I'd never seen before, this documentary is a masterpiece.  I've watched it over and over; it's like a live-action coffee table book.  If you like Picasso, this is the most valuable and substantial thing you can own.",1146441600,39,431,4.558441558441558
1883990,5,B00009ME9S,"For anyone with an interest in art or Pablo Picasso in particular - this is 'THE' dvd to own. But coming from Richardson (whose two books on the young Picasso are among the best there is - Still awaiting the third!) I couldn't have expected any less.  No murky footage on this dvd (unlike many other of those old dusty art bios) crystal clear images, good interviews, and lots of interesting info throughout. For all involved in it's making - My thanks!  It's been a joy to watch again and again...

(Now if you'll excuse me... have to go muster some 'Voodoo' of my own... ;O)",1127606400,20,576,4.415094339622642
1883991,5,B00009ME9S,I love this documentary by John Richardson. It is an honor to have been asked to contribute to this great DVD with a lengthy selection of biographical and critical material from the ON-LINE PICASSO PROJECT.,1065139200,8,206,4.914285714285715

7991343,5,B00009ME9S,"At 2-1/2 hours in length, this documentary by John Richardson, long time friend and biographer of Picasso, offers a comprehensive view into the life and works of this most prolific artist. Richardson accompanies us as we visit many of the places Picasso lived, friends and family members and associates, Picasso scholars, museums, and art collections. The cinematography is quite stunning with beautiful glimpses of architecture and scenery and art. We learn what inspired Picasso as a young artist and through each of his periods - the Blue Period, the Rose Period, Cubism, Classicism, and Surrealism. The significance and hidden clues in many of his paintings are revealed by Richardson.

It is believed that Picasso created ~50,000 works of art in his lifetime - paintings, sculptures, drawings, ceramics, prints, tapestries and rugs. His art was in a constant state of flux and he maintained a great stylistic versatility throughout his career. Though I'm sure there are many scholars and imitators of Picasso, it's hard to imagine a more comprehensive and thoughtful treatment than what is put forth in this fascinating documentary by John Richardson.",1420502400,,1156,5.316939890710382
7991344,5,B00009ME9S,I loved this and appreciated the depth of content. I now have a much greater respect for the art of Picasso and how he came to formulate his art.,1418774400,,145,4.0344827586206895
7991345,5,B00009ME9S,"This film, presented by John Richardson Picasso's friend and biographer, is excellent.  Richardson presents both Picasso's artwork and life in an informed, compassionate and realistic manner.  He also has no problem saying when he thinks a piece of Picasso's work is crap.  It's by far the best work about Picasso that I've seen.",1418428800,,329,5.169811320754717
7991346,5,B00009ME9S,"I actually ordered this DVD for my cousin who doesn't have internet. She had seen it on TV years ago and always wanted to see it again. She invited me to look at it when it arrived, and I could see why she loved it.
It presented an authentic view of Picasso's life and for those who liked his work it is a pleasure to see how he progressed through his different periods, and to see his personal life, and loves.
Because I'm a caring person the bullfight scene disturbed me. I know people say, 'oh it's cultural' but I find the aspect of human beings getting pleasure of gory torture to any animal (including humans) upsetting, and disgusting. However, the scene is not too drawn out, and must be shown, because this was an integral part of Picasso's life.",1370390400,,755,4.4
7991347,3,B00009ME9S,"The 2nd part of this movie was especially interesting.  The part where the foreign author woman sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the F.B.I., or American authorities for information about my father.  There is a stack of papers that she received about Pablo Picasso, most of the information on the papers heavily redacted.  That there IS / WAS a / an 'F.B.I. File' on him, at all was news to me; yet now I comprehend so many more things pertaining to my own life that were previously unknown.  Seems like that F.O.I.A. that the foreign author filed spurred or spawned some additional actions pertaining to the release of information from the intel community; American government.  In this movie 2nd part it looks like he joined the Communist Party AFTER WW2.  If it was prior to then, maybe it was the: 'lesser of the two evils' politically available in a Socialist country??  Because he was a Nazi target, I wonder if he made that choice so to protect himself?  There has not been enough writing / documentary productions made about the facts pertaining to the situation of some of the Hebrew artists who were targets during WW2; nor about the extraordinary measures that American military, intel took to save the planet, to save culture, to save art, to save artists, artists lines, too.",1363046400,,1306,4.773333333333333
7991348,5,B00009ME9S,"Yes, you could read the several volumes of John Richardson's life of Picasso, or you could sit back, relax, and enjoy this excellent documentary film, filled with beautiful images of Picasso's works, Richardson's insightful summary of personal, artistic and historic events, and interviews with all those still living who knew Picasso well - conversations, really, since Richardson is a long time friend of so many of Picasso's family and intimates. In the process of watching this thoroughly engrossing and beautiful film, you'll learn much of what you would have by reading Richardson's multi-volume biography. A true Picasso scholar would do both, but if you don't have that time to invest, this film is the shortcut to Picasso savvy.",1287446400,2,737,5.254237288135593
7991349,5,B00009ME9S,"I thought this was a decent collection.  Information is collected from several interesting sources, including a personal friend.  If you are in agreement with linking an artist's private life closely with their work, then this collection does justice to the stories behind Picasso's art.  It's a bit of a haul, time-wise, but well worth it (I watched it in chunks).",1279324800,,365,5.05
7991350,2,B00009ME9S,"This is way over-rated. Do NOT buy this if you intend to show it to students. I bought it for high school students and they are immediately turned off by the old narrator with English accent. Considering what an intense life full of relationship and artistic drama Picasso led, this DVD manages to make it boring. There are some insights into his relationships, but overall I have to give this a thumbs down as an educational tool.",1242172800,6,431,4.6103896103896105
7991351,5,B00009ME9S,"This dvd was a Valentine's Day gift from my girlfriend and I was thrilled when watching it with her. I am obsessed with the man and the legend Picasso, owning a huge collection of books and online documents on the artist's life and I was please by the entire DVD. John Richardson has the best biographies on the artist and he Narrates this DVD perfectly. I would highly recommend this Dvd to anyone that is obsessed with the Minotaur the way I am.",1203292800,4,447,4.397590361445783
