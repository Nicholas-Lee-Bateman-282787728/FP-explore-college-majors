1105951,2,6305909741,"Having been in the Film/TV Industry for some 40 years, I think I can make the following comment:
If as the VCI box states 'Digitally Remastered', I think I can safely say that it has been remastered from a VHS Copy.
I know the extremely poor Video & Audio is going to definitely lessen my enjoyment of the movie, thus I'm sure that it's safe for me to offer only 2* at this stage.
If you are going to watch this on a fairly old 4:3 TV that isn't overly sharp and does not add any video noise to the picture, it may be good for a weekend matinee, but please, don't expect too much from this version.
Likewise if your sound set-up is Hi-Fi in any way, it's only going to emphasize the very poor sound.
I'm sure I'm not being too ""picky"" as many many movies, much older than this one, have been wonderfully restored to make their presentation A1 on any entertainment system.",1311206400,2,871,4.253012048192771
1105952,3,6305909741,"Sundown, 1941 film

This movie is dedicated to the few men whose courage and faith serves many others. There is a map of Africa and Kenya. A small airplane lands, a lone woman leaves. The natives welcome her. ""A man with a good wife is never a poor man."" Justice is served. Two trimotor airplanes land with supplies. A new official arrives, he is taking over. What are the Shenzi doing? ""May I have a drink, please?"" says the stranger, a Hollander. Kuypens is a geologist. The next day there is an ambush. Can the Askari capture his gun? Yes. It is a Manlicher rifle from the Skoda works in Czecho-Slovakia. The Italian prisoner explains the importance of Africa for world domination. [Still true today?] They caught a trader suspected of arms smuggling to the Shenzi tribe. He's only a go-between. Security is strengthened at the post with night patrols.

A new trading caravan stops at the post for permission to travel. Zia is the new owner of a large trading company. They have a dinner party. Commissioner Crawford talks to Zia about local events. Suddenly many of the people leave. Will one of the six white men die soon? The natives say so. Later a man opens fire with a tommy gun, but misses Crawford. He is pursued and shot. Zia knows what the Hollander Kuypens is really doing. She wants to be a supplier. The body of Fellini is found next to a word in the sand. Nairobi orders a troop movement. The contraband arms were brought to the Shenzi people. No added forces are available to Crawford. He and Dewey discover arms and ammunition among the natives. But Crawford is captured by Keypens. Zia tells him what happened. Can Crawford escape to send a warning? Can Major Coombes stage an attack on the enemy to turn the situation around? Will the good guys win at the end?

There is a speech about the church and the army as the supports for civilization: moral leadership and physical force. [No mention about who controls them?] In London there is a memorial service that sums up the message of this early wartime movie.

This movie is just about average. Its value is its setting in Kenya and outlook for the times. The story could have been set in WW I due to the save colonialist intrigues. After WW II there would be an anti-colonialist revolt that would result in the independence of Kenya. Would this be followed by a military take-over by troops trained by the former colonial rulers?",1299542400,,2402,4.592074592074592

An exotic, mysterious caravan mistress (Gene Tierney) arrives at their isolated outpost, but is she a friend, or is it her extensive trading network that the Nazis are using to move their weapons shipments?

""Sundown"" is a fairly run-of-the-mill colonial drama, with the steadfast British troops and their valiant native allies standing fast against those who would bring low Britain. It's got a more interesting cast of characters than many of these films--with the liberal minded Crawford truly standing out--and the cast is mostly excellent. The film also benefits from a more exotic locale than many of these films, and the gorgeous photography takes full advantage of this, as does the script. (One bit of repetition that made me scratch my head: why did the bad guys always get gunned down in pools of water?)

Aside from the great camera work, another reason to see ""Sundown"" is the presence of the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney. She truly is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever appear on film, and she doesn't do a whole lot more than walk around looking exotic and gorgeous here. If you haven't seen Tierney do majestically beautiful, you need to see this movie.",1171756800,2,1388,4.902127659574468

In 1935, he directed the acclaimed ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" which received several Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and for which Hathaway was nominated for the Academy Award for Directing...During the 1940s Hathaway began making films in the pseudo documentary or semi documentary vein, often intersperse with the then popular film noir style; these included ""The House on 92nd Street"" for which he was nominated for a best director award by the New York Film Critics Circle and his 1948 film, ""Call Northside 777"", in which Hathaway demonstrated one of the first on-screen uses of a Fax machine...His 1953 film noir thriller titled ""Niagara"" starred the up-and-coming Marilyn Monroe...In the 1960s Hathaway returned to a genre he cared a great deal about, directing John Wayne in several notable Western films including his Oscar winning performance in ""True Grit"".... Hathaway also directed 1966's ""Nevada Smith"", another Western starring Steve McQueen that was based on the Harold Robbins novel ""The Carpetbaggers""....here is a partial filmography of Hathaway's work --- Heritage of the Desert (1932), Now and Forever (1934),Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935), The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936), Johnny Apollo (1940), China Girl (1942), The House on 92nd Street (1945), Kiss of Death (1947), Call Northside 777 (1948), Down to the Sea in Ships (1949), The Black Rose (1950), Rawhide (1951), The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel (1951),Niagara (1953), Prince Valiant (1954), 23 Paces to Baker Street (1956), Legend of the Lost (1957), Woman Obsessed (1959), North To Alaska (1960), How the West Was Won (1962), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Nevada Smith (1966), True Grit (1969), Airport (1970)...Henry Hathaway made his 65th and last film in 1974, although an often overlooked director, his body of work earned him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1638 Vine Street.

1105957,3,6305909741,"An alright war movie whose release pre-dated the United States' entry into World War Two by a couple of months, Henry Hathaway's SUNDOWN (1941) doesn't contain, beyond a couple of skirmishes, any combat battle scenes nor, for its first hour, all that much action.

  Gene Tierney plays Zia, an exotic and beautiful leader of a thriving band of nomadic traders.  Bruce Cabot is Crawford, a British - Canadian, actually - commissioner in the small Kenyan village of Monicka, in what was then British East Africa.  While the big war is heating up in Europe, British Regular George Sanders (Coombes) arrives to find out who's sending guns to the hostile natives.  A key to Axis global domination, at least as formulated by this movie, is control of Africa.  Fortunately, the docile natives love the paternal British.  Heck, even a captured Italian (Joseph Calleia) is thoughtfully anti-Fascist.

  SUNDOWN is a terribly talky action movie, with about two-thirds of it taking place in and around bwana macooba's commandant hut.  Don't know if I've got the spelling right on that, but that's what the affectionate villagers call Crawford.  This film was nominated for three Oscars - for cinematography, art direction, and musical score.  It's a pleasant enough little jungle fantasy in a ""Tarzan Goes to War"" sense.  It's hard to take seriously as a war movie, though, despite its opening dedication to the gallants in the beginning and Sir Cedric Hardwicke homily at the end.

  Also on the disk - a definite added bonus - is a 1953 episode of `Four Star Playhouse.'  Hosted by Ronald Colman, this 25-minute play stars a young Angela Lansbury in a adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's `A String of Beads.'",1130457600,9,1699,4.960992907801418
1105958,3,6305909741,"They did a nice job of restoring and putting this on DVD. Excerpts from the movie are shown in a window in the menu. A featurette ""A String of Beads"" is included. I thought the featurette was a bit slow but the movie is good. Gene Tierney, Bruce Cabot, and Harry Carey all give good performances in Sundown. The movie takes place in Africa during WWII. Bruce Cabot is the commander at a British outpost and he must contend with German gunrunners and rebellious tribes. Gene Tierny as a caravan trader and Harry Carey as a big game hunter come to his aid. If you enjoy older movies like Beau Geste or Casablanca you will probably enjoy this as well. The price makes it well worth owning if you collect classic movies.",1039219200,20,716,4.431818181818182
1105959,4,6305909741,"The picture's been restored quality-wise, but a scene present on my otherwise poor quality videotape version is missing here: as the Italian prisoner demands an honor guard to take him to the stockade, the Dutchman arrives outside the bungalow and asks for water, which he dispenses to his native escort. In the dvd, the Italian's tirade ends abruptly and the Dutchman is just in front of the desk all of a sudden. Not much, I know, and probably not even 5 minutes, but it does add a sympathetic quality to the Dutchman which becomes important later.
Avoid the alleged trailer if you haven't seen the movie. It looks like the dvd producers just strung some scenes together to make a digest version of the film. The plot twists are given away.
I do like this movie very much, enough that the this dvd not being perfect annoys me.",1008460800,38,828,4.601351351351352
1105960,4,6305909741,"Poor Gene Tierney!  After luring her away from the Broadway stage where she had scored in comedy roles, Hollywood proved at a loss as to how to showcase her acting talent.  Accordingly, she was cast in a series of  improbable roles in which her chief responsibility was to look ravishingly  gorgeous.  ""Sundown"", filmed while Tierney was still just 20  years old, is a prime example of how her acting abilities were wasted  during her first couple of years in films.  In this patriotic WWII  action-adventure set in Africa, she plays an exotic half-caste caravan  owner (later revealed to be British!) who helps the Allied forces keep the  continent from becoming an Axis stronghold.  The plot is confused and silly  claptrap, but it's all beautifully photographed by Charles Lang (who would  work with Tierney again on ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" at Fox),  excitingly scored by Miklos Rozsa ... and Tierney is indeed breathtakingly  lovely in her midriff-baring costumes, which is reason enough to watch.  (Also pay close attention to catch a very young Dorothy Dandridge in a  small featured role!)
The VCI Home Video DVD is definitely the version of  this movie to see.  The original copyright had lapsed, and the film had  fallen into the public domain.  As a result, the marketplace was flooded  with cheaply produced video copies transfered from grainy, washed-out  multi-generational prints. The VCI DVD has been restored and digitally  mastered, and the result is a sharp, crisp presentation offering excellent  video contrast and vastly-improved sound that has been appropriately  copyrighted by the archivists.
The DVD also offers a small, but  well-chosen, stills gallery; a newly created video trailer; and  well-written albeit flawed cast biographies (Tierney's actual birthdate is  November 19, 1920, not November 20 as misreported by ""The New York  Times"" ... and her first film was ""The Return of Frank  James"", not ""The Return of Jesse James""). There's also a  bonus featurette of Ronald Colman, Angela Lansbury, and Nigel Bruce in the  1954 television adaptation of Somerset Maugham's story ""A String of  Beads"" ... which has nothing at all to do with the feature film, but  is a most welcome and entertaining surprise nonetheless.  Overall, this  edition is highly recommended for Tierney fans, and a fine example of the  potential inherent in the DVD format.",960595200,70,2376,5.136482939632546

Yes, while there is a battle scene near the end, things progress rather slowly here without the blood, guts and sex one usually finds in today's adventure features!

1106271,3,6305909741,"This is a 1941 black & white classic that's set in British Colonial East Africa during the beginning of WWII. The Germans are smuggling weapons to one of the native tribes to encourage an uprising against the British. Add the disdainful British with one officer that is infatuated with Africa and an Italian prisoner of war who has taught geopolitics and cooks. Now add an exotic woman (African/French) that owns trading caravans. Next? What a mix! I found it interesting because of the American portrayal of the war at that time . . .  directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Bruce Cabot and Gene Tierney. For those of us who find this genre of interest, you might want to give it a chance. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards . . . note the word 'nominated.'  ""Sundown"" is the best time of day! Native culture isn't completely accurate but it does offer a glimpse into their traditions and the native colonial army. Adventures and misadventures aplenty!",1394668800,7,967,4.75
1106272,3,6305909741,This was a classic British Colonial era jaunt in Africa. The story line was  uninteresting but the cinematography was quite charming.,1388793600,,133,5.333333333333333

To my surprise, I was not only able to pick out many spots on the mesa but was treated to a neat old movie as well.  Cool.",1387756800,,294,3.634920634920635
1106274,3,6305909741,I'll watch anything that features Gene Tierney in a feature role.  I wouldn't be able to tell you a thing about the story.  My memory leans toward thinking it was better than expected.  George Sanders is always dependable.  I've seen him in so many roles that I get the sense that he is just playing himself with a bit of nuance.,1386028800,,329,4.344262295081967

Gene Tierney new to pictures at this time, but lovely. and George Sanders as a soldier who isn't so nice...a perfect for him. not a great movie in its day, but it is still better than what they put out on tv now a days. so if you think it is a Casablanca reworking, it isn't. but it is a good costumer in the dessert with pretty girls and foreign soldiers.",1361577600,,410,3.9518072289156625

1106279,4,6305909741,"As a big Gene Tierney fan, I was excited to see this early offering (she was just 20 went it was made) which was not available on Netflix or elsewhere. In this film she is alluring and complete eye candy in her bangles and beads! She also adds an exotic touch as an Egyptian trader with high ideals, who places her own life in danger by playing along with German gun runners in order to help the British in their efforts to keep North Africa free at the beginning of WWII. The story is certainly dated, the quality of the DVD fair but watchable. For Tierney fans, a real delight to see her in an early starring role using her sensuality to manipulate the men around her. A solid B+ at a reasonable price . . .",1344729600,,709,4.182481751824818
1106280,2,6305909741,"The reason for the low rating is the missing scene referenced by another reviewer.  I have seen the scene on a Treeline 50 pack which included this film.  The VCI DVD has had restoration work, and it looks good, but WHY restore an edited film.  It makes no sense, especially when this scene is obviously not lost.  I'm afraid I just don't see the knowledge and dedication among some of the current DVD producers to make sure we are getting a complete film when it is available, even if you have to put one together from more than one print.  Missing footage and bad splices in films are just not acceptable unless there is no other choice.  Anyway, the featurette is quite good.  Incorrectly refered to A String of Pearls"" on the DVD case, it is ""A String of Beads"".  Originally shown on Four Star Playhouse.",1329004800,3,808,4.486301369863014

7899122,3,6305909741,"It may seem incredible to us now that such a racist film would be shown; but it was 1941, and the movie is a record of its time.  Only the people with light skin were worth any notice.  It starts with the birthday party where the beautiful Arab woman is relegated to the small table outside; I had to note that the local people (black people) were nowhere in camera view.  It later turns out that the woman is not Arab, but European.  The obligatory uplifting quotation at the end is merely a function of a nation preparing for war, but the racism is so pervasive that it likely escaped any notice.  Equally disturbing is the inane (supposedly native) music.  I give it 3 stars simply because the film should be seen to recognize what progress, no matter how limited, we have made in the years since. On a side note, it still confuses me why Hollywood had men hold women's upper arms every time they ran.",1467590400,,904,4.383233532934132
