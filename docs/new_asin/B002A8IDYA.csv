I don't know where this was filmed or how, but the audio and video on this DVD is terrible!  It's really a shame because it has wonderful information that I would have enjoyed if not for the bad video.  It skipped like crazy.  It was like watching a badly streaming video on YouTube.  It would play a little, then stop, play a little, then stop.  Very annoying.  I know it's not my DVD player because other DVD's play on it just fine.",1511740800,,540,4.2254901960784315
8359091,5,B002A8IDYA,I did not receive a DVD. I received a book. The book was wonderful and very easy to understand.  However if there is a dvd out there I would like to know.,1417910400,,154,3.8125
