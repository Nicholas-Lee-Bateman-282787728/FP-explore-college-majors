A must see if you are an Edwige Fenech fan.",1283644800,2,153,4.310344827586207
8339854,3,B001SGEUDS,"This recent release from MYA communications isn`t terrible - I know that`s not sounding like a favorable review, so here are the pros and cons. It`s a German comedy from 1969 that takes place in the 19th century that amounts to little more than a protracted British Benny Hill skit, or an entry in the popular 'Carry On' series, and I`m not a big fan of either.(I typically don`t like slapstick or physical comedy). It`s about 2 Counts who own a castle, dislike each other immensely and live on opposing sides of the castle, complete with a red line drawn down the middle to designate whose side is whose`s (yes, it`s that silly). The two place a bet to see who will be first to bed down the new virgin maids, and the winner gets the castle. Enter a young Edwige Fenech, and all bets are off. Other peripheral characters get involved in the shennagins with comedic/disasterous results, and it resolves itself the way you`d expect it to. Happily, and preposterously. If you`re a fan of Benny Hill, 'Carry On' or Edwige Fenech(it`s one of her earliest roles, heretofor unavailable in the NTSC format), then check it out, otherwise it`s a lightweight kind of a drag.",1260835200,3,1163,4.650485436893204
