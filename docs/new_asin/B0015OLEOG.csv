3146216,5,B0015OLEOG,"Great Coming of age movie. I saw it a while back and was very pleased with the movie. It is about a mom and her daughter who have reveresed roles. The mom is the one who is very wild, doing drugs and being somewhat of a bohemian, while the daughter is mature for her age. Nudity is in the movie of both actresses. I read about the movie in a guide on Amazon.com titled The Definitive Guide To Girls In Coming Of Age Movies 2015.",1414368000,5,428,4.047058823529412

3146222,3,B0015OLEOG,"I was more or less raised to be of use to someone, or something; to have goals, work, not be lazy, etc., and I think that's good advice.  I've heard from many sources that my life should be of some service; this movies seems to revolve around people who's philosophies are opposite my own.  Even joy and contentment are better when shared and earned.

There's the useless mother who can't stop getting pregnant and running to her mother for help, while her own daughter is surrounded by drugs, other people who have no sense of direction, and who, for the most part, are pretty un-productive and unhappy.  Most of the adults deal drugs, use drugs, cheat the gov't to avoid any type labor, living off alimony, welfare, thievery.  The young mother has a 9yr old daughter trying to live through and make some sense of all this; the movie ends with her getting her menses.  All I can say is Good luck to you, Sweetheart, you're going to need it.

The movie explores and suggests a kind of Beavis and Butthead philosophy and lifestyle, and it appears that's what the characters strive for, but success at failure isn't making any of them happy.

The movie is entertaining if you don't simply stop it from an overwhelming feeling of disgust; it may have something important to say, but if it did I missed it.",1391644800,5,1302,4.55793991416309
3146223,3,B0015OLEOG,"This looks like a good movie, but I was hoping for English subtitles and a disk I could play on a region 1 player. Region 0 plays on anything if I'm right, but this disk requires a region 4 player. So if you don't know Spanish pretty well, or you don't have a region 4 dvd player, don't waste your money.",1363824000,2,304,4.0

8259333,4,B0015OLEOG,"Id call it a slice of life in the lives of family and friends and how things go from bad to a much lesser bad. The little girl is a pleasure to watch and shes the one the movie rotates around from her mother, father, grandmothers, neighbor, drug dealer and her mothers employer. Its depressing and at times uplifting to see how people deal with what they're given or how they just happen to choose to live their lives. You likely won't agree with what you see but it really doesnt matter. When someone wants to make a career out of taking vacations you easily get the sense that they may all be slackers but I didn't get that impression. The humor is good and frequent and nothing seemed lost having to read it. The sub-titles were cut in half on the bottom and we had to change the aspect ratio on the TV and then we were fine. This has been on our Watchlist for a long time because the synopsis and picture but it was a pleasure to watch and then it just suddenly ends.",1509235200,,971,4.197860962566845
8259334,4,B0015OLEOG,"The offbeat drama, Las Mantenidas Sin Sueos, or, Kept and Dreamless, is truly impressive for a directorial debut. Ambitious filmmaker Vera Fogwill takes on the triple duties of directing, screenwriting, and portraying Florencia, a young, single drug-dependent mother unable to care for her prepubescent daughter, Eugenia. Fogwill plays this demanding role with such conviction that the viewer may find himself/herself feeling forever at odds with her character. Eugenia, as played by Lucia Snieg, becomes the film's shining star whose independent, free-spirited personality charms the people around her. The whimsical Eugenia spends time entertaining herself and tending to her own needs as much as she tries to keep her coke-addled mother in check. She quickly forms a close bond with a kind-hearted older neighbor (played by Edda Diaz) who eagerly hopes Eugenia will accept her as a grandmotherly figure. Edda Diaz's enthusiastic, bright-eyed performance keeps the plot interesting and prevents the film from becoming depressing. Another star of the film (apart from the human cast) is Tomas, a striking grey, long-haired cat. I'm not so much of a ""cat person"", but whenever Tomas made an appearance, I hardly took notice of the actors.

The only real flaws of this film are a few underdeveloped, implausible characters and crude acting from some of the supporting cast. Without them, the plot would have been stronger, bringing more focus to the primary characters. If you enjoy ""coming of age"" films with an indie feel and don't mind a plot centered around drug abuse and child neglect, there are enough unusual characters to keep it entertaining. Please take note that this film contains adult situations not recommendable for viewers under age 14. (3.5 stars)",1482710400,,1765,5.326164874551972
