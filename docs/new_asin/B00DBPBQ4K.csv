5787349,5,B00DBPBQ4K,"This is a movie chronologically showing you the life of Barry Sanders. There are football highlights of his runs, but not as much as I would have liked. There are also 2 short bonus portions which show Barry's backwards runs produced in 1999 and a brief video of his son who attends Stanford, BJ Sanders. If you're into an emotional roller coaster ride, this is the movie to watch. It shows the ups and down of Barry's life, but always makes you love Barry for his family values.

5787375,5,B00DBPBQ4K,"What can I say about Sanders' on-field performance that hasn't already been said before by so many others?

In addition to his undeniable skill, I'd add that he was a true class act, in part because he never ""celebrated"" having done what was his job in the first place, unlike many other NFL (and NCAA) RB's with sometimes only a mere fraction of his talent. He also avoided the limelight, and never got sucked into the hunger for fame and adulation that sadly grips many in college and pro sports, including some other true greats.

The effect of his father on his development was very interesting as well. If more young men had a father like that at home, so many of their lives would be so different.

If you could only have one of these NFL: A Football Life DVDs, this would be the one to get.",1393027200,,797,4.371621621621622

This video has calmed many a difficult days like when she has a fever, waiting for brother or sister to finish practice or when on a late plane trip. Crazy how she has gravitated to this video. It's so soothing and gentle and she loves football. (Dad and big brother enjoy this more than Barney...Ha!) Didn't know or appreciate Barry Sanders before watching this video with my little girl. What a great story and worthy tribute to an amazing player and gentleman. She has good taste! We lost the video so it's a must to replace. Love Barry's humility and integrity. Happy to encourage my kids to enjoy his story and celebrate his achievements.",1517875200,,684,4.614754098360656
