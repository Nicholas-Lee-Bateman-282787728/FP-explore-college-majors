8655861,5,B00K4Q8AV6,"As a beginning gardener this DVD provided me with inspiration and motivation to grow my own organic vegetables. While the DVD doesn't go into the larger context of growing, I can see that there are a lot of ways to manipulate the weather and those things that keep you from growing year round in conventional gardening. For example, the keyhole garden can provide heat, it can shield from wind and cold, and it can provide a way to handle food wastes and cardboard recycling...that alone was worth the cost....$24...totally worth it.",1436832000,6,533,4.868131868131868
8655862,5,B00K4Q8AV6,"I am not a big gardener and will always look for an easier way.  If you want a simple, easy way to garden with the minimal amount of work, this is it.  No tilling/plowing; no bending over to weed; easy disposal of kitchen scraps (yay!); and a LOT of plants in a small amount of space.  This DVD will give you the steps, literally from the ground up, on building a keyhole garden.  If you are just starting out gardening or are a long-time gardener looking for a way to keep gardening with an aging back, this just might be what you are looking for.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am friends with Dr. Deb, but I can assure you that this DVD covers her building process exactly as she does in her seminars held here and all over the country.  I truly believe it is something anyone can use to begin building their first keyhole garden and to enjoy keyhole gardening for a long time.",1431734400,8,888,4.255952380952381
8655863,5,B00K4Q8AV6,"I bought this DVD a few years ago, and I must say I can't disagree with the other reviewer more.

The DVD follows two people (Deb and Hank) as they build a keyhole garden. It talks about what's needed, how you should organize it, what to do with it. Its approach is relaxed but informative. It includes useful facts (43 cinderblocks needed to build a standard keyhole garden), and useful advice (avoid tobacco products because they can transmit a virus). The advice comes in little vignettes -- Hank wants to put in an old cigarette carton. Deb says not to, because virus. Hank says there's no tobacco in the carton, and Deb replies ""you hope"". So you could say it sounds like a garden show, as opposed to a high school training film.

I've given copies of the DVD to relatives, so they could build their own.",1431561600,9,809,4.496598639455782
8655864,1,B00K4Q8AV6,I was looking for a knowledgeable how to video. What I got was recording of a fluff garden show. There is more and better information on line at the Catholic Relief Services website including much better video,1418688000,4,209,4.675675675675675
