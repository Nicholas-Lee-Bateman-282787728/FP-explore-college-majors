3803955,5,B001US3XQY,"The ninth and final season of ""DRAGON BALL Z"" and this final box set does not disappoint as we get 38 awesome episodes featuring the Z-Warriors most evil enemy ever, Majin Buu.

With the last season ending with a cliffhanger, the World's Champ Mr. Satan has managed to make Majin Buu more compassionate towards life when Buu is given a puppy.  But sure enough, two criminals gun down Buu's puppy and then all hell erupts.  This new anger that Majin Buu has never felt before has him spawn another form of Buu.  While the current Buu (big version) was able accept humanity and become peaceful, this new Evil Buu (skinner and muscular) is everything that was evil.

This Evil Buu manages to beat the current Majin Buu and convert his power over to his and becoming much more powerful.

As for the Z-Warriors, with Vegeta sacrificing his life in the last volume and Goku no longer with the living (since the Cell Saga) and in another dimension withe the Supreme Kais watching Gohan train, Piccolo is left to train Trunks and Goten and making sure they perfect their fusion technique to become Gotenks, the last opportunity for Planet Earth to destroy Evil Buu.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""DRAGON BALL Z"" season nine was aired in Japan during the mid-90's.  For these episodes to be nearly 15 years old, FUNimation did the picture quality some justice by remastering the series.  By working with Video Post & Transfer, they used the original Japanese film masters and transferred them using a Spirit DataCine and passing through a Digital Vision DVNR1000 to remove film grain and then using a Teranex VC6000 video computer for DNR (digital noise reduction) to remove thousands of instances of dirt, scratches and debris.

The video footage signal was then ran through a da Vinci 2K Plus color system to make sure the color is very close to the original Japanese film prints.  After color correction, the final media was then transferred via Sony's HDCAM (high definition digital tape) and created in 1080p HD at 24 frames per second.

So, what we get is a very clean transfer (note: A transfer that would make it even much more cleaner and colorful if presented in Blu-ray) on DVD and the best looking transfer of the episodes in the US thus far.  It is important to note that the transfer is not devoid of dust and scratches.  You will see it on occasion but overall, the colors are much sharper and more vibrant.

Audio is presented in three audio tracks.  English voice track with original Japanese music via 5.1 surround, English voice track with TV broadcast music stereo and Japanese voice track with original music and in mono.

As mentioned in my previous reviews, I have watched ""Dragon Ball Z"" when it was first aired in Japan and have rented every episode and have watched it in Japanese.  But until I started reviewing the FUNimation Entertainment box set releases of the series, I have really enjoyed the English dubwork.  I felt the series was well-cast and truthfully, with the original series in mono and hearing it in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, it's hard to go back and listen to the series in mono.

But the great news is that you get the three different audio tracks to suit those with different audio preferences.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

You get the original Japanese opening intro without text and the ending Japanese outro without text.  Also, FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

After 250+ episodes, the final 38 episodes are now available in one box set.

I can easily remember when these episodes hit Japan and having friends over to watch the battle with the Z-Warriors and Buu.  Of course, none of us at the time understood Japanese but to watch these final episodes (which went on to continue with ""Dragon Ball GT""), what an exciting time to see the Fusion Saga but also to see Goku and Vegeta having to work with each other.  To think how ""DRAGON BALL Z"" started as Vegeta was a major enemy of Goku and now to find them working together and fighting together was very enjoyable to watch.

Needless to say, this final season is packed with action but also quite a bit of humor as well.  Buu is such an interesting villain.  Whereas Frieza is the destroyer and Cell was just plain evil, Evil Buu was much more powerful than either of them but where the others would go on destruction campaigns, Buu's motivation was enjoying the fight and eating sweets and chocolates.  Definitely a far cry from Frieza and Cell but overall, Buu was a unique villain.  And to see Hercule (Mr. Satan) take some initiative (and also becoming the series clown), it was so interesting to see how he would be important in these final episodes.

If there was any disappointment, it was that Gohan who had such a buildup throughout all the seasons from his younger age to his younger pre-teenage years, his character received the less amount of attention (battle wise) and more focus on the character of Trunks and Goten as Gotenks.  Afterall, we have seen how powerful Gohan had gotten in his battles versus Frieza and Cell, I was hoping to see some sort of unleash of Gohan that would really show off his character now as an older teenager.

Nevertheless, the series brought everything back home with a storyline that focused on the two Saiyans which are Goku and Vegeta, and the way these two interact is always fun to watch and you'll always know that when these two are together, there is either a lot of action, or a lot of humorous scenes between the two.  And fortunately, you get both.

""DRAGON BALL Z - SEASON NINE"" ends the whole ""DRAGON BALL Z"" arc and this season like the previous eight are just magnificent.  You literally get more bang for your buck with over 30 episodes included on each DVD box set.  And the series does continue with the two seasons of ""DRAGON BALL GT"" (now available from FUNimation Entertainment).

I absolutely love this series and after watching it in Japanese way back then, it was great to watch the series remastered and digitally restored but also to enjoy it not just in Japanese but also with the English dub.  The voice acting is so well-done, this series is probably the best cast anime series.  There are a ton of characters and FUNimation Entertainment has done a great job in finding the right voice actors to do the job.

In closing, I highly recommend every season box set of ""DRAGON BALL Z"".  I know that because this series has been digitally remastered in High Definition, there are many who are wondering if they should wait until there is an announcement of the Blu-ray release of the anime TV series.  For now, we don't know if there will be a Blu-ray release but for ""DRAGON BALL Z"" in the US.

So, for now, the DVD is the only choice available at this time.  Just think that each box set has 30+ episodes for around $30-$35 which is a steal compared to how much collecting ""DRAGON BALL Z"" several years ago which one DVD with a few episodes would have cost next to $20.  You simply are getting your money's worth!

If you purchased every season thus far for ""DRAGON BALL Z"", you can't go wrong with this final season nine. Each episode is action-packed, plenty of humor and there are many memorable scenes.  Its simply a must buy!  Every season of ""DRAGON BALL Z"" is a must buy!

Highly recommended!",1243641600,,12707,4.420984455958549
3803956,5,B001US3XQY,"this is the end of the best anime series ever, and what a way to end it

if youve gotem  all to this point no reason to stop now",1243641600,6,128,3.3793103448275863
3803957,4,B001US3XQY,"Regardless of how you feel about the Dragon Ball Z franchise, one thing that's certain is the dedication and attention to detail Funimation includes in their DVD box set releases of the show is without rival.  Whether a long time fan of the property or a neophyte, the Dragon Ball Z Ninth Season box set packs an awful lot of material into its $29.95 MSRP.

What Funimation classifies as the ninth season of the long-running show is in fact the final installment (episodes 254- 291) spaced across 6 discs.  With a total runtime of just over 900 minutes, clear a few weeks on your calendar to absorb the 38-episode run contained here.

Despite a fairly kid-friendly look and theme, the show wears a PG rating which presumably stems only from the show's penchant for silly violence (after all, this is an entire program based on the concept of interstellar fisticuffs).

Sound and language options are especially impressive even for a Funimation release (which are known for leaving no stone unturned).  Contained are options for an English dialog track with original Japanese music (5.1 Surround), English dialog with the television broadcast music score (stereo), Japanese dialog with the original music (mono), and the choice of English subtitles over any of them.

Considering that the first episode of this set is actually the two hundred and fifty fourth episode of the show, it goes without saying that this probably isn't the best starting point for beginners looking to enter into the universe.  Admittedly, I haven't followed the show steadily at any point of its historical run but found the ninth season to be pleasant enough to follow.

The major story arc (which includes the complete Fusion and Kid Buu sagas) follows a spree of terror conducted by a fleshy super villain alien called Majin Buu.  The good guys, a rag tag group of scrappy warriors consisting of Goku, Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, Gohan, Krillin, Chiaotzu, Vegeta, Trunks, Yamcha, Goten, and Gotenks (or the Z Fighters for short) are charged with the task of protecting not only the earth but the seven mystical Dragon Balls as well from this threat.

Now I don't pretend to be a diehard Dragon Ball Z fan (or a shonen series fan in general for that matter), but can certainly appreciate the excitement generated by fans and the attention to detail Funimation displays in the set.  Not only are all of the episodes digitally remastered in high definition and digitally restored, but the fold out box set also includes a lovely 28-page book.  Additionally the material has been transferred in wide screen directly from the original Japanese film stock and the English dialog has been revised as well.

Considering the fact that this particular season was broadcast in Japan way back in 1993, the restoration process has been quite beneficial to the looks of the show's art as well.  Colors are surprisingly rich and the animation, though slightly dated when compared to the best of today's computer generated efforts, still holds up surprisingly well.

Love or hate the often over-the-top antics of the characters within the show, there is little argument to the fact that the Dragon Ball Z franchise is credited with paving the way for the American/ Japanese anime pop culture explosion that would be soon to follow (think Pokemon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh! and more recently and specifically, shows like Naruto and Bleach).

The show builds to a very fitting crescendo and bids a fitting farewell to the series (excluding the Dragon Ball GT continuation which is, of course, not based on the original manga) with its unique blend of action, fantasy, fighting, and mythological themes.

While sad that like all great things, the Dragon Ball Z saga came to an end, take comfort in the fact that Funimation has gone to great lengths to release the final season on DVD with all of the charming nuisances and attention to detail the show deserves.",1242518400,10,3909,4.932926829268292
3803958,5,B001US3XQY,"There has been a lot said about cropped vs standard, but I've got to say. All I care about is I can now own every DBZ episode, and it won't cost me $1500. That said, these are my favorite episodes of DBZ, and I cant wait to own them. The fight against Buu is the greatest fight of all, an it does not dissapoint.",1238544000,3,312,3.890625
3803959,5,B001US3XQY,"I give the whole series five stars but only four stars on all of these sets. The cropping doesnt bother me that much,eventhough it gets annoying sometimes. Dont get me wrong they are great and deserve 5 stars because they are extremely cheaper than previous sets, contain all of the episodes and the picture quality is the best i've seen for the series, but I want the true uncut episodes.
I want the episodes that don't just show blood and a few(very few) cuss/curse words, I want all of the big four letter word cuss/curse words.
A good example of that is if you have seen the part on these episodes when Piccalo and Gotenks trap skinny Buu(before he starts absorbing z fighters) in the time chamber and he begins to scream and cause a rift in time once the door has been destoryed, he starts dropping F bombs like crazy. Repeatedly over and over again. Thats what I want, I'm tired of having every character say Damn you when we all know what they are really saying.
 I understand the fact that they don't do this because of children watching these episodes but think for a minute. When this show was the most popular was around 1999 to maybe 2005 in America;give or take a few years. Dont you think the majority of those kids and young adults have gotten older by now. Another thing last time I checked most kids watch these episodes in english anyway so put the uncensored version in japanese like it used to be with correct translations. I only watch this in japanese anyway so I would even buy the version that was only in japanese if they sold it. I won't buy these episodes from japan because anything could be wrong with them(not work, no subtitles,not the right dvd player, or damaged discs).
In conclusion if Funimation is going to say this is the way DBZ was meant to be seen,uncut, then truly make it uncut and uncensored than you would have a definitve set and series.",1237075200,5,1883,4.473837209302325
3803960,5,B001US3XQY,"This long awaited ninth boxed set will finish up Dragon Ball Z on DVD. It's been just over two years since I excitedly bought the season one set and I have anxiously awaited this ninth one, but at the same time it's weird to feel like this series is ending for me all over again. Nevertheless these episodes are action packed and a fitting ending for one of the most loved anime of all times. This set contains the Fusion and Kid Buu sagas in these final 38 uncut episodes:

254 The Evil of Men_____________ 255 Buu Against Buu
256 Empty Planet_______________ 257 Time Struggle
258 Super Moves of Gotenks_____ 259 Trapped in Forever
260 Feeding Frenzy_____________ 261 Gotenks is Awesome
262 Unlucky Break______________ 263 A Whole New Gohan
264 Search for Survivors_________ 265 Majin Buu Transforms
266 The Old Kai's Weapon________ 267 Ready to Fuse?
268 Union of Rivals______________ 269 Meet Vegito
270 Rip in the Universe___________ 271 Vegito...Downsized
272 The Incredible Fighting Candy__ 273 The Innards of Buu
274 Mind Trap__________________ 275 Visions of Deadly
276 Evil Kid Buu_________________ 277 End of Earth
278 True Saiyans Fight Alone______ 279 Battle for the Universe Begins
280 Vegeta's Respect____________ 281 Minute of Desperation
282 Old Buu Emerges____________ 283 Earth Reborn
284 Call to Action_______________ 285 People of Earth Unite
286 Spirit Bomb Triumphant_______ 287 Celebrations with Majin Buu
288 He's Always Late____________ 289 Grandaughter Pan
290 Buu's Reincarnation__________ 291 Goku's Next Journey

These episodes are all for the most part entertaining and a lot of them are fan favorites. The stakes really get raised as everyone on the planet is put in immediate jeopardy soon after followed by the possible destruction of the planet earth itself. The final Kid Buu episodes are great and find the entire existence of life in the universe being threatened ratcheting everything up to it's highest possible levels. The final episodes should be truly pleasing for fans to rewatch or experience for their first time.

I've said before that I appreciate how these sets were made with an overall theme across the nine that line up well and look good together on a shelf. A well made booklet comes in each of these sets containing brief character bios and episode descriptions. The video is always well restored and in excellent condition, presented as Widescreen 16:9 Aspect Ratio. The audio is great with three different options:

American English Voice Track with American Music
American Voice Track with the Original Japanese Music
Original Japanese Voice Track with the Original Japanese Music.

The only extras on these sets have been trailer's for other Funimation productions and textless opening theme and ending credits.

These episodes are not just the final saga to the Dragon Ball Z series but also to the Dragon Ball series that began it all. The storylines here aren't just full of the science fiction and hard hitting fights Dragon Ball Z was known for but also the elements of magic, fantasy and off beat humor that Dragon Ball was known for. Looking at these episodes now, they are the perfect ending to such an entertaining series that artfully managed to constantly escalate things through a seemingly natural course of events. After these episodes it seems hard to imagine more epic storylines for these particular character's than what we're given here.

This final set is full with equal amounts of the fighting fans expect as well as the elements of humor and fantasy that make this series so loved, fusing the two perfectly. Akira Toriyama ended his long running story fittingly and satisfactorily for fans with these sagas all ending with a final nod towards the Goku we were introduced to way back at the start of Dragon Ball, a Goku that looks at everything as a challenge and adventure.

I can't wait until this set is released in May, thanks for your time.",1236556800,56,3925,5.046296296296297

The Z fighters Battle, To Take The Formidable Majin Buu Down In This Finale Of The Buu Saga. IT'S INDEED THE BEST Action Pack Season Set, Which Ends The Series OF DRAGON BALL Z!

Finally Funimations decide to be nice to us by releasing another Season Set and including all the remaining episodes of DBZ.
I still remember A couple years back, when I spent almost $50 dollars just for the 5 DVD Set that only included the Kid Buu saga, Not only were the Old DVD's expensive and almost impossible to find, there were also a total space waster. Season nine set is A must have! Not only is it cheaper, It's a non-stop fierce action show, that never stops to take it up to the next level, not even to the every End. (It also helps that the size of the Set doesn't take up a lot of room like the Pervious 1999-2003 Sets.)

So, finally having the Funny Guys at FUNImations releasing very easy to find Season Sets at $30 price range, make me want to slap my self for even attempting to collect over 80 DVD's of DBZ.

I really wish they would of released these Season Sets a long time ago and The way they take there sweet A$$ time to re-release this Series makes me wonder if there going to Re-re-release them again on (blu-ray) or try to release them like they did in Japan, with the Dragon Box which included all 291 Episodes in Two Large Box Sets and also included a large amount of DVD EXTRAS!!! Hmm.... Funimations! the ball's in your court!

Description:
Majin Buu Has Cut a Path of Destruction Across The Earth, Leaving Nothing But Devastation, It Could Even Be Beyond The Power of The Dragon Balls To Repair.

3803982,5,B001US3XQY,"The buu Saga never disappointed and there is so much mass murder and killing, new transformations, fusions, traitors and so much to it, but the Highest Peak for the show is of course Season 6 with the end of the Cell Saga. Personally I love this saga, it is very long and it has so much into it as Buu takes on many different forms, and is known for the most powerful foe the warriors have fought in the Dragon Ball Z. We see Goku and Vegeta unite in battle, and I mean that literally, witch is such an amazing height for the show. Showing that when united they don't even need to be a super saiyan to destroy buu. Unfortunately they do let the battle drag on to long.. To many spoilers! The end of Dragon Ball Z finally came on this blu ray set. From the very moment I watched the show it went to brutal fighting and killing, to Goku's son fighting to become a warrior on his own to the end of the Buu Saga, This Is a wonderful show and a great end for the show. The Majin Buu saga is awesome, and I hope that this review of the show helps you out into getting this set as well as the 2 previous seasons of the Buu saga.",1495843200,,1121,4.008928571428571

Let me explain it to you so you can understand now imagine star trek being released on blu ray and fans complaining and  whining ""why is this fullscreen why isn't this widescreen ?"" Huh that's because when star trek was made for tv they weren't no widescreen TV's but we can make it widescreen if you want but we have to cut everyone's heads off ! is that ok with you ? And the true fans and purist would have said heck no  ! but a lot of dbz fans are ignorant unlike star trek fans and buy this garbage and that's why funimation cancelled the dbz levels blurays release cuz they were fullscreen
and the  ignorant dbz fans don't like seeing there widescreen TV's not fill the whole screen!! That's because it's not suppose !!",1469664000,2,812,4.328947368421052

Reading up on forums and online reviews, purists complain that the aspect ratio was changed cutting out minor details, or that color remastering is the devil, but honestly I like how it was all packaged, and that I had the option to pick between Japanese or American music arrangements.

Also has a marathon mode, so you can just plow through every episode on a disk.

If you loved the show growing up, and can afford to invest in this full set, go ahead and do it.  Pick your favorite season to try it out, and you'll probably buy all the rest. That's what I did.",1459123200,,675,4.291338582677166

It's absolutely amazing. The visuals are soooo good. People may complain about the 16:9 aspect ratio, but Funimation cleverly cropped it this time. I don't have surround sound, so I have no idea what it sounds like but I've heard per season, it get's better and better.

Easily, in my personal opinion this is the best season quality wise. I own the others and also the extras in this season are great! Another bonus is the packaging, it's not cheap. The disc don't over lap with each other like the Chucky Collection and other collection disc do. That is really annoying to me, and I can assure that the disc don't come like that.",1418428800,,685,4.516129032258065
3804192,4,B001US3XQY,"Finally was able to complete my collection with Season 9. Unfortantely it's one of my least favorite seasons, personally think Seasons 2-8 were the best in the saga. 9 has some epic moments but Buu Saga was just way too drawn out in my opinion, almost mercilesly. I think it was due to the writers trying to make the ending to the last saga as epic as they could, it left a bit of an unsatisfied taste in my mouth, something I don't associate with the other seasons of DBZ. Don't want to complain that much because this my favorite show of all time. I'd recommend.",1418428800,2,564,4.330188679245283
3804193,5,B001US3XQY,"Just as the rest of these blu ray sets, image quality is great. I personally find this to be the best season as it contains the fusion and kid buu saga.

3804216,5,B001US3XQY,"The Buu saga, overall, isn't on par with the level of quality that The Cell Games Saga brings, and nowhere close to The Frieza Saga.

  But, with that being said, and being the ultimate DBZ fan that I am, I actually found alot to like about The Buu Saga. And if you're like me, than you'll agree when I say this is a MUST BUY either way. So allow me to break all this down for you. *Spoiler Warning*

  The fusion dance is dumb, yes, but Gotenks is cool, and Vegito is totally awesome. The fat Buu was super annoying, but later when he becomes Kid Buu s*** gets pretty intense. The saga did drag it's feet at times, but how it ends more than makes up for it.

I always like when characters have a good side vs. evil side conflict. Once all the good left him, he became a pure evil kid who just wants to destroy with no knowledge of pain. Kid Buu is scary. I also like the parts when Goku and Vegeta are venturing inside Buu to find all the people he absorbed. The final major battle in the series was an intense climax. Vegeta intrigued me the most when he let go of his pride and decided to work with Goku towards the end. Vegeta was getting his butt kicked just to buy time for Goku to build the Spirit Bomb. And even that wasn't enough! They had to get help from the whole world and even 3 Dragonball wishes to stop Buu.",1406851200,,810,4.232258064516129

Many hardcore DBZ fans do not like these Orange Brick releases due to them being cropped for widescreen tvs and pick on the cleanup process being less than stellar. Come on....this anime aired in Japan in 1989. How good do you them expect it to look??  The package is nice, I like the Bruce Falconer track, the discs look great and the entire set looks great together. The picture quality is good...it won't blow you away, but unless they completely redraw the entire anime is never going to look like something that is more recent. The cropping rarely is bothersome....every now and then you will come across a scene and you will notice it, but for the most part you will not unless you are comparing images side by side.

Now for S9 itself. I am probably in the minority here, but I think DBZ reached its pinnacle at the Frieza saga. Goku going Super Saiyan...nothing tops that to me. The Android/Cell saga was good too. Everything after the Cell games though just took a turn for the worse. I still love the show, but it never reached those heights again.",1403740800,3,1094,4.492462311557789
3804237,4,B001US3XQY,"Just don't set it to english dub. The standard with funimation is to make it sound as stupid as it possibly can so viewers can be embarrassed to watch it with someone else around.

Use the original Japanese dub with english subs and you'll be fine.",1402876800,,248,4.391304347826087
3804238,5,B001US3XQY,"If you're looking to purchase this box set, you've more than likely seen dbz and very familiar with the series. If you're like me, you've been hit with a bout of nostalgia and want to spend your summer with Son Goku and the rest. Cool box set, and good price. And retains the ""old school-ness"" I've come to appreciate with Toei and Funimation. I just really wanted to say the the amazon.com editorial review IS THE WORSE! It spoils the saga, gives way too much detail and harms the series in an unfair way. I figure if it sucks, say so but be considerate of the ones who have no idea and save the intimate details so the product can be judge fairly. Why describe the series and then say it sucks. Why does it suck? Where did it suck? That reviewer sucks and I'm done.",1401580800,,767,4.260273972602739

3804255,5,B001US3XQY,"I wasn't able to watch the buu saga when it originally aired, but I'm glad I found it on here. I'm not happy how the season ended. I just hope gt doesn't end the same way",1395705600,,170,3.75
3804256,4,B001US3XQY,"It's kind of odd because this was the season that got me into Dragon Ball Z but in the end it's actually my least favorite. Maybe it's because it's the last one. Or maybe I just heard to much B.S. come out of Hercule's mouth. I don't know, but I still picked it up to complete the collection. I'd say the high point of this chapter is when Goku and Vegita fuse and become the warrior Vegito. Other than that I just can't help but compare it to the previous chapters and to me it feels like the previous ones had more going for them. At any rate, it completes the story that started in the World Martial Arts saga and does have some funny moments. The monster Majin Buu was interesting as well. Even though it's my least favorite chapter, I wouldn't call it bad. I'd still definitely recommend it. Just keep in mind if you get this and enjoy it then you really should check out the previous sagas because they are great!",1395187200,,919,4.257142857142857

3804263,5,B001US3XQY,"In my opinion, this is the best season of DBZ by far. Buu was always my favorite villian and stays that to this day. This season focuses on the conflict that the Z Fighters face as they are met with a very strong foe. Buu not only has many abilities that make him the strongest yet, but he also has many forms that are even better than the last. (His form, Fat Buu, is my favorite because I found him quite funny.) We also see the emergence of Goku's super saiyan three form as well as the fusion of him and Vegeta. All around great season and great fighting.",1392854400,,559,4.137614678899083

Great bonus though is the audio options:

Original Japanese w/ Japanese score
English dub w/ Japanese score
English dub w/ North American score

If you're a fan, this is one of the better versions available without having to pick up each individual DVD from the previous NA release.  Until they release a completely true to original Blu-Ray, this is probably the best DBZ you're going to find.",1385337600,,540,4.680851063829787

I mean c'mon first I have to wait a week to get it and it costs 25$ I at least expect them to send me one that doesn't sound like theres bits and pieces of plastic shaking in it in the first place. Dissapointed in you amazon",1368144000,,524,4.0
3804311,5,B001US3XQY,"Dragon Ball Season Set may or may not include a printed booklet, which I could not care less. They can be downloaded from dragonballz.com anyway. Dragon Ball Z Season Set is by far the highest quality official release of Dragon Ball Z. I used to rent Dragon Ball Z from a Singapore rental store when I studied there, which turned out to be a poor-quality bootleg copy.
Some people may favor higher-quality audio of English Dub. But it did not match every single word said in Japanese closely or wholly, essentially a localized version of Dragon Ball Z using the same video footage and basic storyline, with some differences in the interpretation of events. To me, Boo Saga established the ending for both the manga and Dragon Ball Z, once again confirming Goku is the strongest man in the universe who defeated the seemingly invincible Kid Boo against all odds, with the power donated by the people of earth who are pushed to their limits. The digital remastering of video footage is well done. I generally enjoy the video quality pretty much. The original producer of Dragon Ball Z did re-dub the Japanese audio in higher quality in a new installment, called Dragon Ball Z Kai (or Dragon Ball Kai), but instead for the original uncut version like its licensee did, the producer instead chose to create a ""streamlined"" version of it using the same video footage, with Boo Saga may be released in the future according to some rumors. Personally, I would favor the re-dubbing of Japanese audio the original uncut Dragon Ball Z. As such, I completely dismissed ""Kai"" entirely when I have Dragon Ball anime series (508 episodes, 16 seasons) in possession, especially FUNimation did do a good job in the digital remastering of video footage. The original Japanese audio may be mono, but the Japanese audio track in Dragon Ball Z season sets are stereos, perhaps created by putting two same mono tracks into two channels. Dragon Ball Season Sets (the first installments) did have the one-channel mono tracks.
Frankly, they did not have much time left to do the re-dub for Japanese audio with the original sound actors, as they are getting older. If they chose different actors, it would no longer be ""original"".
If the local dubbing did not create its own interpretation or version of the story, I would happily jump over to English dubbing. Until then, I am ready to put up with this Japanese audio track, with English subtitle, of course.
Do I like Boo Saga? I like it so much that I recently published a blog post at [...] titled ""Boo Saga, Goku, and Copyright"". You can also see the picture taken for the DVD covers at [...] I give Dragon Ball Z Season 9 and the entire Dragon Ball anime series 5 stars!",1367452800,,2701,4.70042194092827

3804339,5,B001US3XQY,"I love DragonBall Z since I was little. To have this collection in my procession is amazing to me because for a long time I couldn't find the shows for DBZ. Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.

3804342,3,B001US3XQY,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Nine box set includes six DVDs that contain the final thirty-eight episodes of the series.  The first two discs contain seven episodes, the next three discs contain six episodes, and the final disc contains six episodes and the extras.  The first thirty-three episodes on the set focus on the battle with Majin Boo, while the remaining five episodes are the aftermath of the battle and another Tenkaichi Tournament.

One of the best features of the Dragon Ball Z sets is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

There are a minimal amount of bonus features included in the set.  This set still includes textless opening and closing songs, which are the same ones that appeared on the Dragon Ball Z Season Seven and Eight DVD box sets.  On these textless songs, the credit text is gone, but there are still subtitles that appear on the screen.  Also in the extras menu is a link for trailers.

As with the previous eight box sets, there are still issues with the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's splash screen at the beginning of the discs, the trailer at the start of the disc, and the menu are mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes themselves were mastered at a very soft audio level.  I also have to say that the majority of the episodes on this disc were rather tedious to watch, because the battle with Majin Boo just drags on for a ridiculous amount of time.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, as well as with most of the episodes included on the set, this release is still a ""must get"" for a Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD and isn't interested in obtaining either the Dragon Boxes or the remastered Blu-ray releases.

So I asked Amazon to replace the item through their returns program. I since then have received three, rather two more season nine sets and all three did not have the booklet although they were in new condition wrapped and everything!

So the dilemma of trying to find out what is really going on here! What is three New Condition season nine sets being sold without booklets?! Either from Funimation or from Amazon!

All and i do mean all of the characters from the start to now, are in this season. We finally see some pain in the rear characters grow up and really come of age and see even the evil characters wish Goku well in his quest ( for lack of a better word).
The two most perfect vilens are cell and Buu. but I think I'd get this one for the pure enjoyment of seeing some sort of closure to the series. ( of course, they didn't, but they should have in my opinion)

The only chance that he has is to trust in the hearts of the people he has sworn to protect all those years ago. The final showdown begins as enemies finally put aside their differences and see each other as equals, but more importantly as friends.

Dragon Ball Z comes to an incredible conclusion in the final two DBZ sagas. These battles are as intense as they come. They are filled with action and heavy hitting. This is pretty much what the DBZ fans crave, a true Super Saiyan extravaganza. In the end the wrongs are set right and Earth finally returns to a time of peace...or at least until the next adventure!

While the ending is a little on the week side it is nice to get a little epilouge to see all the characters grown up and even get the biggest surprise of all. Goku has become a GRANDFATHER!!! They say that Dragon Ball Z is the greatest action cartoon ever made, now that I have seen the entire series from begining to end I think I can agree.",1270166400,,1135,4.323943661971831
3804361,5,B001US3XQY,as always Dragonball z season 9 doesn't  dissapoint great work with the frams very pleased,1268092800,,90,5.0
3804362,5,B001US3XQY,"When I started watching the first couple of episodes I thought ""Wow! This is a great season to have"". They differently went above and beyond with this season.  Season 9 is a perfect 50/50 balance of humour and action.

There was an intense moment where the mad man shot Mr. Satan and where Majin Buu was expelling all of the evil inside of him. The fight between the good and evil Majin Buu was great and the good Buu got a taste of his own medicine by turning himself into a piece of chocolate, thanks to the efforts of the evil Buu.
Piccolo also did a great job by being the leader, in the absence of Goku, Gohan & Vegeta.
One thing that is difference about this season is that all of Goku's friends and family die at the hands of the evil Majin Buu. Like Ox King, Chi Chi, Mr Popo, Master Roshi etc who have played minor parts throughout the Dragonball and Dragonball Z but have appeared constantly.
This is also the first time that a DBZ villain has managed to kill the entire Earth's population and blows up planet Earth.

The fight between Gotenks and Super Buu was funny and action packed at the same time. I liked the different arsenal of attacks that Gotenks used on Buu. They had so many different ones with interesting names as well.
I suppose the reason why Piccolo was in shock at the Lookout being destroyed is because Kami is apart of Piccolo, and Kami use to be the guardian so he also didn't like when the Lookout is destroyed, especially when Garlic Jnr first appeared to Kami in Season 4.
It is great to see that the Old Kai gave up his life so Goku could return to Earth. For a while I thought Goku was happy being dead and never wanting to be wished back to life so he can see his family and friends again.
When Dende was healing Gohan, and then Super Buu wanted to kill Dende after seeing his ability to heal, I thought back to Season 3 (Freiza Saga) and the reason why Frieza killed Dende is because he saw Dende heal Piccolo and so Dende could have died a second time for the same reason he did the first (Super villain sees Dende heal a Z fighter and so Super villain must kill Dende).
Goku should have imagined what he would look like if he fused with Mr Satan's dog (just for fun). It is great to see Videl, Chi Chi and Bulma have caught up with Dabura in heaven and that Dabura has changed completely from the King of the Demons to a happy, loyal and loving spirit.
My favourite Vegito episodes are `Vegito...Downsized' and `Incredible Fighting Candy'. The reasons why I liked these two and not the first two `Meet Vegito' and `Rip in the Universe' are because they were more fast and interesting in terms of action. I liked `Incredible Fighting Candy' episode because even when Vegito is turned into a piece of candy he still manages to fight Buu in a comical and interesting way. Another great moment is where Goku & Vegeta travel inside Buu's body and fight the thought forms of Gohan, Piccolo and Gotenks.  There is an intense moment where kid Buu destroys the Earth and Goku & Vegeta are running to escape it the energy ball. It is sad to see that Gohan, Piccolo, Trunks and Goten die in the explosion of planet Earth. I would have liked to see Gohan survive because he was alive for the large part of DBZ. It would have been great to see Gohan, to be the only Z-fighter that has not died throughout the entire series. Also Tien and Chiaotzu would have died in the explosion as well.

Goku's fight with kid Buu was fast paced and the attacks were brutal.
I like it when they show Hell in Other world, with bad guys such as Cell, Doctor Gero, Babidi, King Cold, Frieza, Appule and the 4 members of the Ginyu Force. I would have liked to have seen Nappa and Raditz talking about Vegeta and Goku since they both had some connection to them both. Also since Captain Ginyu the frog died in the explosion of planet Earth, I would have liked to see him return to his original body and meet up with the other members of the Ginyu Force.

Vegeta's fight with kid Buu, showed he could really push his own limits and go beyond them.
The fight between kid Buu and the fat Buu was comical & fun. One part is where the good Buu spits into 4 entities and pounds the hell out of kid Buu.
It is great to see past characters, which don't play much of a part but still are around. Like the ones they showed: Upa & Bora, Android 17, Suno & Eighter (Android 8), Devilman and Nam. It really did make me happy when the people of the world giving up their energy in an effort to defeat Buu once and for all.  What a great episode, to end off Dragonball Z.Another character they should have added is Launch. She should have been robbing a bank and points her gun at the hostages and they raise up their hands.

The fight with Goku and Uub at the Martial Arts Tournament was electrifying. They should have made a movie between the 7-year gap of the end of DBZ and the beginning of GT with Goku training Uub.

On the front cover, which has Super Vegito, I would have put one of the evil forms of Majin Buu, because like Season 3(Frieza) and Season 5(Perfect Cell) they have had the main bad guy on the front cover. Vegito only appeared in 4 episodes and so there aren't enough grounds for him to appear on the last season of Dragonball Z.

If I had the power to change who gets to be on the front covers they will be: Season 1(Goku),Season 2 (Vegeta),Season 3(Frieza),Season 4(Krillin),Season 5(Piccolo),Season 6(Perfect Cell),Season 7(Great Saiyaman Gohan),Season 8 (Majin Vegeta or SS3 Goku) and Season 9 (Any one of the evil forms of Majin Buu)

When I look at the entire story for Dragonball Z, I wouldn't change it. The things that have happened, happen for a reason.
For example:
* If Goku hadn't sacrificed himself to rid the world from Raditz, he would have never trained with King Kai and learned the Spirit Bomb and Kaioken Attack technique, which he has used throughout DBZ to vanquish enemies such as Turles, Lord Slug, Super Android 13, Doctor Wheelo and kid Buu (Goku did use the Spirit Bomb against Vegeta and Frieza but they survived it).
* If Piccolo hadn't told Raditz about the dragonballs, Vegeta and Nappa would have never come to Earth.
* If Nappa hadn't killed Piccolo, Bulma, Krillin and Gohan would never have gone to Planet Namek to revive their fallen friends.
* And on planet Namek, a lot of Freiza's men were killed thanks to the local Nameks and Vegeta (who was spared by Krillin by Goku's plea)
* If Frieza hadn't killed Krillin, Goku would never have transformed into a Super Sayian.
* If Goku hadn't died a second time, during the Cell Games saga, Goku wouldn't have trained in Other World and attained levels Super Sayian 2 and 3.

Out of the 9 seasons for DBZ, I actually like watching seasons 2,3,5,6,8 and 9. It doesn't mean I hate watching seasons 1,4 and 7. It just means from the beginning of one season to the end, it just has a lot more exciting scenes in it than seasons 1,4 and 7. In seasons 1,4 and 7 there are a few episodes which are a bit slow or I hate to say this `boring'.

sure the characters speak english & japanese language with that option in the menu but if anime is going to be released in us boxsets you think they would add us intros i nthe option menu for anyone who gets tired of of the same song over & over again that has no words i mean the japanes intro i can deal with but the ending give us the option to the us version if im going to watch a show like dbz give us an upbeat intro & ending that has words in it with guitars what cartoonnetwork did with he series yes series sucked on cartoonnetwork since it was edited but the the intro & ending i could never get tired of its up beat.

japanese version is low down melow something you would hear at a funealr but the us version seomthing you would hear at rock that fits the theme to dbz exactly great series need more options for the intors & ending music to hear i recomend on buying all box sets if your dbz fan",1252022400,,1385,4.032727272727273
3804366,1,B001US3XQY,"Ok so apparently in order to fill the ""remastering quota"" at Funimation they ruined Super Buu's already pathetic voice. Rather than simplistic and throaty as it was before, it's high pitched and just plain irritating.

This ""remastering quota is just horrible. In seasons 1 and 2 you can barely see it since Vegeta's voice was changed to christopher R Sabat and little else. However as they got more into seasons 4 5 and 6 (with Vegeta's voice arleady done by Christopher R Sabat) they needed to find soemthing else in every episode to fulfill the bs quota of remastering the series. So apparently that means sticking additional diolague when it wasn't needed (such as babidi's additional diolague when Vegeta charges up his Atomic Blast) and here in season 7, by replacing Super Buu's voice to make it sound worse.

I wouldn't be so extremely upset if i couldn't tell all this ""remastering"" was so pointless and clearly a policy by Corporate that was half assed by the staff.",1249344000,2,976,4.803571428571429

Definately worth buying.",1249171200,,170,4.666666666666667
3804369,5,B001US3XQY,"I've been a diehard ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this boxset! This boxset has all of the episodes from the Fusion and Kid Buu Sagas and has the conclusion to the ""DragonBall Z"" series. There are many, many, many spoilers ahead, so don't read past here if you haven't seen this season yet!

 At the beginning of the Fusion Saga, a jerky man shoots the now-friendly Majin Buu's dog, Bee, leading Majin Buu to get so mad that he splits himself apart, between the good Majin Buu (the big, childlike one, Mr. Buu) and the evil side of him, Evil Buu (the tall, skinny, nonchildlike, gray one). Evil Buu absorbs Majin Buu/Good Buu/Mr. Buu, turning him into Super Buu, the entirely evil form of Buu, which the good guys begin to fight for almost all of the Fusion Saga. Piccolo teaches Goten (Goku's second son) and Trunks (the kid Trunks from the present timeline) how to fuse with each other and they eventually create Gotenks, their fused form. Gotenks fights Super Buu, Super Buu absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo, so Goku and Vegeta fuse and create Gogeta, their fused form. Gogeta gets absorbed by Super Buu after he transforms them into candy, which they attack him as before they get absorbed. When Super Buu absorbs/eats them, they split apart and make their way out of Super Buu's body. Eventually, Goku and Vegeta get Gohan, Piccolo, and Gotenks out of Super Buu, and he eventually begins to transform into Kid Buu, the original form of Buu that Bibidi (another of the villains that I like that appears in the flashback at the ""End of Earth"" episode of the Kid Buu Saga) created, leading to the Supreme Kai, Kibito, and Old Kai to go to the flashback in the ""End of Earth"" episode that explains about Buu's past. Buu transforms into Ultra Buu and then Kid Buu and blows up the Earth, making Goku, Vegeta, Hercule, and the revived Bee, go to the Kai's planet. Goku and Vegeta get Kid Buu to get rid of the Good buu/Mr. Buu and they fight him. Eventually, Mr. Buu and Vegeta help Goku get all of the energy on Earth and the rest of the universe to create a Spirit Bomb and launch it at Kid Buu, killing him. A few years later, Goku fights against Kid Buu's good, reincarnated form, Ubb (Ubb is Buu spelled backwards) and the series ends, leading to ""DragonBall GT"". I love this boxset and the conclusion to ""DragonBall Z"" and I can't wait to get this and the ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" boxsets that I don't have yet!",1247616000,,2501,4.530973451327434
3804370,5,B001US3XQY,"I really like how Goku beats Kid Buu With the Super Spirit Bomb!  The package that I got in the mail was damaged...The first disc and fifth disc holders are loose, when you close the DVD holder the CDs come out.",1246752000,,211,4.146341463414634
3804371,5,B001US3XQY,The 9th box set wraps up the DBZ story. If you have the first 8 I really don't need to tell you why this is the greatest anime of all time.,1246492800,,139,3.5161290322580645
3804372,5,B001US3XQY,"There will always be those that give this series bad reviews, but the fact remains it was one of the closest-to-script adaptations with some of the coolest voices from the cast of Funimation (as far as the English dub is concerned).

YES some supposedly 5 minute fights are dragged out over 10 episodes or more

YES Toriyama-san wanted to stop at the Freeza saga but the fans wanted more so it was pushed all the way to Buu saga

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT??? It has a solid story and solid action, great fights, great characters and development, and AWESOME villains. This anime gets an 11 out of 10!",1246147200,19,592,4.462962962962963

I'm also very impressed by the quality of everything. No glitches or scratches, no skipping, which means NO IRRITATIONS while I'm glued to my seat in suspense! lol.
Happy buying fellow fans! :)",1244505600,,426,4.271604938271605

All the videos do not allow you to change the audio like you would in dvd & blu rays. I was really hoping you could change the Japanese audio towards the U.S soundtrack audio (Bruce Foulconer). That's the version we 90s kids grew up listening to. The soundtrack was so legendary. Anything else you have heard. I would have gave it 5 stars. Really hoping they could add that in the near future on Amazon Prime videos. I would purchase more seasons if this wasn't the case...",1521331200,2,571,4.447619047619048
