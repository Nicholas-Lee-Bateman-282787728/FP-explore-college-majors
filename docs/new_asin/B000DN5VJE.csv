8358023,3,B000DN5VJE,"1993 martial arts film featuring four women in a lot of martial arts action. Plot centers on a painting stolen after WW2 that hides Japanese biowarfare data and a list of Japanese officials. Chinese and Japanese women team up to hunt down bad guys. Not bad flic. English dubbed, no subtitles.",1474416000,,292,4.745098039215686

8358025,3,B000DN5VJE,"If you were to judge this movie by the cover photo you would quite rightly assume that it was about 4 lovely Asian women tearing about on motor cycles `righting wrongs', right? - wrong. Regarding that cover photo the girls do show up on bikes once prior to a punch up in one sequence so that justifies the picture, I guess.
Story has something to do with a painting that depicts Japanese atrocities perpetrated on Chinese citizens during WW2 - however, the proceedings get bogged down with a sub plot about the friendship of the two HK girls played by Moon Lee & Cynthia Khan (credited as Yang on the dvd sleeve). Yukari Oshima is mostly wasted in a minimal part but Michiko Nishiwaki has a bit more to do. The loosely translated subtitles on the HK version don't help much & there is the usual histrionic overacting characteristic of many Chinese films. The dvd starts off in wide screen but quickly goes panned & scanned which as you all know looks great on a wide screen TV. There are a few fight scenes but my opinion is that this movie is for completists only - it could have been so much better considering the actresses involved who are some of my personal favourites.",1330473600,,1175,4.4953271028037385
