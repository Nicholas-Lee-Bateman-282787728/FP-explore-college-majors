8736597,5,B016JB0KDU,"This is an excellent family film about dating. The characters are fully developed and you will relate to one of the characters. There is the religious woman, the educated woman, the street woman and the family minded, mature woman. This movie is about a family and their adventures. Three sisters and their mother have all been hurt by men and they try to cope with single life. They want to find a man and they end up choosing the wrong men. They have to work together and use their common sense to overcome their obstacles. The writing in this film was exceptional. So many women want to find a good man and have difficulty finding one. This is not an uncommon dilemma. This film handles this topic with humor and intellect. The acting is good and the you definitely feel for the characters. This film shows that often women have a good man in their midst but they overlook them for smooth talking, immoral men. This film lets all women know that love for God and family will always help you when you need aid. This is a great date film. The women are so sexy men will love to watch the film just to look at them. The men are handsome and the women will enjoy their smooth lines. I just felt for the women in this film. They really seemed like people that I know. Powell is very good as a smooth talking man. He has made several films with Fox and this is the best one by far. He is funny.
I highly recommend this film. It's funny, romantic and the script makes a lot of sense. Fox does well with her role but the three sisters and the charming Lamman Rucker make the film. A must see for fans of Black, romantic comedies. This film would be rated PG.",1463788800,,1653,4.284345047923322
