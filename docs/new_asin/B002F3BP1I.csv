3920717,5,B002F3BP1I,"The best band in America plays an absolutely phenomenal show. Many people say OCMS play with rock & roll energy, but there aren't many rock acts today that match this level of intensity and artistry. These guys are dynamite from beginning to end. One viewing made most of my country collection obsolete, several more viewings put them high on my list of best bands of all time. I could go on all day! Recommended over and over and over again!!!",1255305600,,444,4.5625

3920721,5,B002F3BP1I,This DVD is amazing. It truly captures the energy and enthusiasm of an Old Crow show. The quality of filming and editing is also incredible.

3920737,5,B002F3BP1I,"A superb show and poignant as Willie Watson, the ""soul"" of the group, left afterwards and they have not been the same since. One of the best concert DVDs I've ever seen and I've seen plenty.",1417478400,,190,4.305555555555555

3920740,5,B002F3BP1I,"It was suggested to us, as we were viewing a Simon/Garfunkel DVD, that Old Crow Medicine Show would be a good addition to our library.  True that!",1399939200,,146,4.407407407407407
3920741,5,B002F3BP1I,I purchased this DVD only knowing a couple OCMS songs. I recently saw them and left impressed. This DVD is great. Loved it. My wife even complained I was playing it too loud so obviously I was cranking it and enjoying it,1399852800,,220,4.261904761904762
3920742,5,B002F3BP1I,Great DVD.  Have seen them in concert and they are wonderful.  So glad I purchased this. Have watched it many times.  BCarter,1398470400,,125,4.590909090909091

3920744,5,B002F3BP1I,Wonderful music that is a little less known compared to much of the existing country music. Terrific... Belongs in any country fan's library..,1392076800,,142,5.217391304347826
3920745,2,B002F3BP1I,"Just listening to the DVD, I understand that it is a wonderful concert that definitely comes across but all I hear are the instruments, the audience and some distant tinny voices coming through faintly.
Fortunately they are wonderful musicians, so not all is lost but must recommend not buying this dvd. It is too difficult to hear, in the future, I will stick with their professionally mixed studio cds.",1383436800,,404,4.869565217391305
3920746,5,B002F3BP1I,Excellent show with could cross section of hits. Sound good and camera work fine for the venue and crowd. A favorite when buzzed and want to share with my Maui condo neighbors,1380758400,,175,4.5
3920747,5,B002F3BP1I,This is a great dvd. Excellent show from a bunch of very talented guys. Watched it three times the first week. A must have for OCMS fans.,1379462400,,137,4.111111111111111
3920748,2,B002F3BP1I,recordings are noisy and unclear like it was recorded by an amateur.  I would not recommend this to anyone period.,1377734400,,114,4.7
3920749,5,B002F3BP1I,"This is so entertaining.  My husband & I have viewed several times. It's energetic, unique, entertaining & addicting.  We watched it until we could not get the songs out of our heads:)  Just get it!  This will not disappoint!",1375401600,,225,4.6923076923076925
3920750,5,B002F3BP1I,Amazing show from Old Crow Medicine Show! If you like Old Crow you'll love this performance! Check this out! Have a good day!,1362441600,,125,4.478260869565218
3920751,5,B002F3BP1I,This is a great DVD for your collection. The old crow medicine show is full of great musicians and play a great set.,1362009600,,116,4.086956521739131
3920752,5,B002F3BP1I,"This DVD is very good.  It's OCMS at their prime.  The harmonies and instrumentals are right on pitch.  You know how some live performances are ""not as good"" as the studio versions.  These tunes are ""just as good"".  And the cinematography especially at The Orange Peel is terrific.  I'd go whole hog ~ five stars.",1356566400,,313,4.6
3920753,5,B002F3BP1I,"I first heard Old Crow Medicine Show on Prarie Home Companion. I liked them so much, I immediately ordered some of their CD's and accidentally bought this DVD. I'm glad I bought it. It is a much better selection than found on any of their CDs, which are also very good. If you purchase anything by this group, make Live at the Orange Peel first. One cannot listen to it and sit still. Enjoy!",1344384000,,391,4.297297297297297
3920754,5,B002F3BP1I,"I bought this DVD after I saw it being broadcast on public television while visiting family in NC last month. It is a great DVD by a great band! Their stage presence is awesome, the crowd is terrific, and the price of the DVD is unbeatable! It was less than a CD!",1326758400,,263,4.076923076923077
3920755,5,B002F3BP1I,"Old Crow Medicine Show is I think one of the most innovative music groups around. Blending bluegrass music with punk rock attitude has produced an interesting sound that is like none others around. In todays music world of mind numbing blandness or musicians who think yelling is singing Old Crow Medicine Show believes in the old school of entertainmant, Play with heart and sing with soul. OCMS shows that talent and hard work still matters. OCMSs latest offering is a DVD of them in concert, Old Crow Medicine Show: Live at The Orange Peel and Tennessee Theatre. For those fans like me who don't have the chance to go see OCMS perform in concert this is the next best thing. In watching them perform on stage the thing that strikes me about them is how much OCMS puts into a show. They hold nothing back and makes it look like that anything less then 100% effort is not acceptable when performing. All of their big hits are played during this DVD from their three nationwide albums they have released as well as some real early hits going back before they hit the big time. A true must for any fan of Old Crow Medicine Show to have. It won't disappoint, I promise.",1317427200,,1167,4.509433962264151
3920756,5,B002F3BP1I,"The music is AWESOME ; so much so that I would like an 8 X 10 with each of the artists autograph and would like to see them in person.  You DO NOT have to be into drugs and booze to appreciate the music (as I have never done).  If you don't mind the lyrics, you will love this selection as I did.  There is so much talent in this group, it is a shame that it is not used to influence the young men and women in a positive way.  I would feel better with less money and the feeling that I had tried to make this world a better place, and that my talent as a group had left it's mark for the GOOD of others.  Hopefully they will come to see that as well, but it is doubtful.",1305072000,,671,3.730496453900709
3920757,5,B002F3BP1I,"I had seen the Old Crow Medicine Show live a couple of times and they blew me away, what a show. The DVD is almost as good on a big tv. I will be ordering more copies to give as gifts. The guys are extremely talented.",1285113600,,217,3.739130434782609
3920758,5,B002F3BP1I,This is one of my favorite Music DVD's I've ever seen. I watch it over and over again. I showed it to my 76 year old step dad and he demanded I order him a copy. He doesn't eve listen to bluegrass. The energy these guys maintane thoughout thier preformance is unbelievable. I saw them live once and they were off the hook for 3 hours. All thier music is original. A must have for any music collection.,1284681600,,401,4.153846153846154
3920759,5,B002F3BP1I,"Even if you THINK you may not like 'Bluegrass', think again by giving this specific group a try.  They are everything you'd want in a band.  Slow, fast (!!!), and medium tempos.  Lyrics are heartfelt & humorous.  Instrumentation great & diverse.  They're alternative (I know, yukky overused term), rock, and VERY hip.  Do yourself a favor & check 'em out!",1269388800,,355,4.833333333333333
3920760,5,B002F3BP1I,"I just received this DVD, what can i say except that this DVD is really great, very good sound and songs, you must have it, i really love this band... OCMS sure got a fan in France...",1263945600,,183,3.972972972972973
3920761,5,B002F3BP1I,awesome show! we have a half a dozen bluegrass get to togethers a year.  this dvd is great for when the band needs a break.,1256169600,,123,3.92

8368728,5,B002F3BP1I,"One of the best concert videos of all time. I wasn't fortunate enough to see the Old Old Crow Medicine Show live but this really lets you know what we missed. Willie Watsons contribution made this (still great) group, something truly magical. This video is a must see for any OCMS fan.",1516665600,,285,4.5
8368729,5,B002F3BP1I,"This video was made before Willie Watson left the group and Critter Fuqua returned. Although the group has become much better on stage in the meanwhile, this DVD shows off the group at its musical best.",1503014400,,202,4.638888888888889

8368731,5,B002F3BP1I,"Good visuals, good music, good price, singers not too far down in the mix per a couple of reviews. Very much recommend this DVD if you like OCMS, bluegrass/string band music or just good music.",1498089600,,193,4.542857142857143
