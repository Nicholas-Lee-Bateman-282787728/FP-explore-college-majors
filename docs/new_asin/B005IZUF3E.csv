4710721,5,B005IZUF3E,"You'll want this DVD set to play the programs when you want. I miss having the series on FIT TV, but owning this set lets me choose which show I want to work with every day. I can choose variety or I can choose to play one episode over and over until I've gotten comfortable with the moves. While the women leading the yoga moves are amazingly fit and beautiful, they're not intimidating. I like the beautiful scenery, the soothing music and the voice of the yoga instructor. You can challenge yourself with some moves or move through poses you are comfortable doing. You'll discover your day is better with this series in your schedule!",1319673600,,637,4.547826086956522
4710722,5,B005IZUF3E,"I was interested in creating a yoga practice for years, when I finally found Kate Potter's Namaste on FIT TV. Namaste works so well for the beginner, and yet grows with you as you continue your practice. I highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to begin or enhance their yoga practice. You can not go wrong with these dvd's!",1319673600,,334,4.491803278688525
4710723,5,B005IZUF3E,"As a child I would do certain stretches that felt good to me and eventually took dance class until I was 18. Still stretching here and there on a day to day basis just felt right. I decided to try some yoga and never found one that I liked, it didn't feel right, either you would just lay there and move from time to time, or the others consisted of arm balances which i didn't have the strength for nor did it make me feel stretched or relaxed. I stumbled upon Kate Potters Namaste Yoga and never stopped doing yoga again It flows and makes me feel relaxed, toned and confidant. Confidence has a lot to do with the way you carry yourself and my posture has become noticeably better, plus the fact that I feel better about myself and have a reason to get up in the morning. These DVD's have also changed the way I looked at life in general. The dynamic flow literally helps me deal with whatever comes up throughout my hectic day. I can't wait for Kate to bring another series to us. I have all of them up to now. Also, she is personable, I emailed her and she personally emailed me back several times
The best yoga DVD series to date.",1318032000,22,1135,4.2110091743119265
4710724,5,B005IZUF3E,I have been an avid fan of Namaste Yoga for the past 6 years on Discovery Health. I was very sad to see that they changed their format and no longer offer the show. But I am now very happy to have this DVD so I can continue with my Namaste (albeit now without commercials WOO HOO!!). I'm sure I'll be ordering the 1st season shortly.,1316476800,16,333,4.0606060606060606
4710725,5,B005IZUF3E,"For a beginner like me, Yoga can be a little daunting. I did not know enough about the various types of yoga that are offered at my gym. The Namaste Yoga DVDs took all the guess work out of it. I am proud to say that I have all three seasons and the complete set. But for this review, I'll be discussing the second in series.

I admit that I am a big fan of the Namaste Yoga DVD workout videos which I originally discovered on TV. I am the type of person who enjoys many different activities from water jogging to the treadmill to Zumba, and step aerobics, and more.  So I like to dabble in yoga as it adds variety to my workouts and is great for helping me relax.

Visually stunning, this DVD is filmed in beautiful surroundings. The background music is lush and soothing. The natural settings change to add visual stimulation. The narrator's voice is very pleasant, calming, and lovely to listen to. A group of lovely women demonstrate the poses and provide wonderful inspiration. The DVD also introduces mantras / meditation for the ultimate relaxation experience.

There are 13 episodes of authentic yoga sequences which adds a great deal of variety. Each episode is 22 minutes long, so I find it quite easy to fit one or two sessions into my busy day. I often do one or more sessions according to my schedule or fitness level or energy level.

Namaste Yoga is the best yoga fitness program I have found to date. I'm thrilled with all three of the DVDs in the series. So much variety, so beautiful to watch, so easy to do! Get all three seasons! Highly recommended!",1470614400,,1569,4.452961672473868
4710726,5,B005IZUF3E,"I enjoyed the first season, ordered the second and enjoy it equally.  A nice practice.",1470268800,,86,4.733333333333333
4710727,1,B005IZUF3E,"I have a half-dozen yoga DVDs that I use nearly every day. I have been regularly doing yoga for over a year.  I purchased this DVD due to its many positive reviews.  I didn't think it would be hard to follow along because I already know quite a few poses.
  The verbal instruction is inadequate and the poses switch from one to another too quickly.  Whenever I would look up to make sure that I was doing a pose correctly, the camera was artfully focused on an irrelevant body part, such as somebody's right arm, giving me no idea of what I was supposed to be doing.
  I am returning this DVD.  This is the worst yoga DVD I have ever purchased; I found doing it to be stressful and potentially dangerous  I was afraid I would hurt myself quickly moving through poses without adequate instruction.",1464048000,6,796,4.397260273972603

4710729,1,B005IZUF3E,This was a horrible dvd with mini  series.  they are too short and You have to keep stopping to get to another segment.  It moves way too quickly.  I have been doing yoga for over 10 years and consider myself a very good intermediate  And - you cannot hear the teacher at all - there is so much background noise.  Horrible.,1459900800,4,323,4.213114754098361
4710730,5,B005IZUF3E,"This set of yoga DVDs are beautiful and relaxing.  I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to yoga.  I have done Bikram yoga many times at different studios, but have only recently started doing yoga at home and these videos are wonderful.  They are very well made, have beautiful scenery, which may sound odd for a yoga video, but it makes it easy and fun to follow.  Each episode/video is not all located in the same place, it changes different scenery throughout each one, so they definitely aren't boring to watch and follow.  I received these as a gift and I really like them. Highly recommend!",1459209600,,597,4.4907407407407405

4710736,5,B005IZUF3E,"Like most other reviewers, I discovered Namaste Yoga on Fit TV.  This series sets the bar, a very high bar, for in home yoga practice.  Kate Potter does a wonderful job narrating each episode.  I love that the episodes are filmed in multiple locations and not in a studio.  The main sequences are approximately 12 minutes.  Some days I will combine 2-3 main sequences for a longer practice.  I like how each main sequence includes several links that build on the previous link.  I purchased Season 2 directly from Namaste Yoga because Amazon was sold out at the time & I didn't want to wait.",1443744000,3,591,4.571428571428571

4710744,5,B005IZUF3E,"The Only Thing I Would Like Is More Time With Each Position.  Kate's programs move kind of fast but so do others I have purchased. Sometimes the pacing is slower and it is Spot On!  I am just trying to learn as much as I can, each time, I approach my mat, so I can move and breathe at my own pace.  I want this to have a deeper feeling,spiritual and physical experience for me :D. I found Janet Stone's DVD to be very good but the pacing was rather quick, especially for a newbe.  I would definitely recommend Kate's DVD's!.",1428537600,,524,4.158415841584159

4710747,5,B005IZUF3E,"The first two seasons of this series are, in a word, AWESOME!  If you want to learn some simple yoga, if you want to be inspired by great scenery and talented yoginis (SP?) going through yoga poses, do yourself a favor and get the first two seasons!  It's not quite perfect, but that is the fault of the editor.  It's helpful to see the transitions between positions.  All too often the editor transitions between shots as the youginis are changing position.  While sometimes annoying, it is not a major problem (hence the five stars)... in these seasons.",1424822400,,555,4.680412371134021

4710765,5,B005IZUF3E,"I have always loved this yoga ever since it was on tv. I was so exited to get it on DVD, since it no longer seems to be on.

When I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas this year, I used it to buy this and I am really glad I did.  The dvd is pricier than most but it is worth it to me.  This is what I want for daily yoga.  I have a couple of favorite yoga books and another dvd set that I use sporadically, but I love this the best.  Kate Potter's voice, the music, the photography, and the scenery really add to the experience.

Each session is fairly short, a few minutes of warm up, 10-15 minutes of yoga and then a cool down. They range from easy to challenging. I like to do 20 min of cardio at home and then one of these episodes, it's a quick mellow after work work-out for when you don't have time to make it to an hour long class. I'm so glad I bought this!

However, the discs were loose in its case and therefore the second disc was damaged :( so I'll be sending it back. I am, however, re-ordering a new one so hopefully this one won't be damaged. Fingers crossed!!!! I love Kate Potter though, so the video itself is amazing. Beautiful yoga flow, beautiful HD setting in Canada, beautiful music... Definitely helps me get in a meditative state when I'm doing my poses. I've been practicing Kate Potter's yoga for years. Also, her practice is great to start with if you haven't done yoga before or have any injuries like I do, because she's gentle and teaches you to listen to your body. You won't regret buying this DVD!",1377561600,,751,4.654135338345864

Leaving them on my DVR cable box took away space I wanted to use for other shows.

It is easy for the beginner or you can put more thought and stretch into it and get better and better.  Never difficult or boring.  Some episodes are much more challenging than the others.  You can start with the easy and when you master them, working up to the others is not too difficult.  You can build your strength in the sitting poses so the standing ballances will be easier.  I feel very encouranged and confident that way.  There are two seasons, get both and you will have a nice variety to keep you interested.  It is the only yoga I do now.",1374192000,,637,4.330508474576271
4710791,5,B005IZUF3E,"I always attempted Yoga but found I didn't like standing for minutes at a time with my left ankle behind my right thigh. This is NOT that type of yoga. It's slow moving and breathing, it's encouraging and challenging enough. You control the amount of the challenge too. I find it to be enough of a work out where I am not winded but I feel so good all over when I'm done. I don't like to miss a day since I can feel it. Also, I stopped doing this for a while (I was learning Tai Chi) and found that I had frequent neck and back aches again. As soon as I went back to this form of yoga, the neck and back aches were gone. It takes less than a half an hour to do each work out. If something is difficult, you can still move through it either because you tell yourself it's only for a few seconds, or the instructor tells you that it is a challenging pose and to just do what you can. I have found that i have a better attitude in life, I am calmer, and certainly more healthy when I do this 5 or 6 times a week. Then again I have read that this is a moving meditation, and that it works like acupressure-healing those parts of your body where you may subconsciously be storing pain or anger.

My only complaint- one of the discs was not secured in the case when I opened the jewel case and it has many light surface scratches on the disc- I didn't return it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon and then having to reorder through the supplier. The disc worked so i just kept it.

After 3 months I got 15 minutes in and was surprised at myself. I'm an older woman who'd pretty much lost hope .

After a move and a new DVR, I was devastated to learn that Namaste Yoga was no longer on TV, so I went in search of the DVD. I was so pleased when I disovered that the full, unedited Namaste routines on my Season 2 DVD were even better than the TV-aired and -edited episodes! The DVD has the same luscious narrative voice, the same gorgeous scenery and soundtrack, the same amazing women leading the practice, and the unexpected but wonderful addition of inspirational mantras separating the warmup from the routine, the routine from the cool-down, and again at the conclusion of the entire session. I was hoping to begin practicing meditation in tandem with my yoga when I ordered this DVD set, and Kate Potter makes the transition from exercise to meditation absolutely seamless. It's impossible to feel anything but peaceful, grateful, and confident at the conclusion of each routine, and the structure transitions you perfectly into meditation posture, allowing you to close with a bow, turn off the TV, and slide right into a deeper, more profound meditative practice immediately. I will forever be grateful to the Namaste Yoga team for creating such beautiful routines that strengthen me both physically and spiritually and make my entire day feel more peaceful and blessed.

Love it! 4.5 solid stars (its tough to get five out of me) I first ran across Namaste Yoga by accident when it was broadcasted on TV around 2005.  When the cable provider dropped the channel, I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
I hadnt been familiar with the vinyasa flow style of yoga. The combination of the shows visual presentation, narration, and music was mesmerizing - like no yoga program I had ever seen.  I felt compelled to try it.
I found the visual presentation unusual and beautiful  vignettes of the poses presented in various gorgeous settings, woven together in a flowing sequence.  The sequence is introduced progressively.  Each pose is demonstrated three times before the sequence begins again and another pose is added on.  As a beginner, that gave me three opportunities to learn and attempt each pose; as I got more familiar, it was perfect to let me loosen up or make minor adjustments to refine the poses.
The music is composed by Tim McCauley.  It is beautiful and rhythmic, and help me find the breathing rhythm. (I learned later that the music was deliberately composed based on breathing rhythm)  I enjoyed the music so much that I also bought the audio CD. Kate Potter narrates.  She has a rich, lovely speaking voice and I find her instructional cues are easy to follow and maintain the rhythm for breathing and moving through the sequences.
Combined together, the sequences become almost dance-like and I love it.
Ive always loved physical activity. In my sixties now, I aint sliding into third base or diving after volleyballs anymore  (not often anyway) and frankly, I miss it. Previously, I had dismissed yoga as chanting and uncomfortable contortions. But Namaste Yoga has introduced me to yoga as a fun experience with mental and physical benefits.  It satisfies my craving for motion and challenging physical activity that I can continue indefinitely. I look forward to mixing this into my circuit and weight training routines, and hope for more  releases in the future. I definitely recommend giving it a try!
Added. I recently found that a third season was broadcasted in 2014. (Strange gap in years)  There have been some changes (new narrator, no longer uses the progressively building sequence technique, and sadly, the music is what I think of as generic yoga music) but Im glad that more flow sequences are available. It's still lovely and enjoyable. However, seasons 1 and 2 remain my absolute favorites.",1503792000,3,2471,4.868735083532219
