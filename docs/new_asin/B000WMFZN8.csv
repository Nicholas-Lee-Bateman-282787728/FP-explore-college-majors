2987544,4,B000WMFZN8,"""Only the Most Ridiculous Parts of the Story Are True""

As I read this brief title card at the beginning of the new Richard Shephard (""The Matador"") film ""The Hunting Party"", I suddenly realized something. For months, I have been watching a trailer for a different film. Funny thing is the film I saw was better than the film promoted by the trailer. Let me explain.

Over the course of many months, I saw the trailer for ""The Hunting Party"" many times. Every time I watched it, the film was painted as a fairly typical war story. Richard Gere plays a reporter covering stories in various war zones, Terrence Howard plays his cameraman. Together, they dodge a lot of bullets and explosions. Jesse Eisenberg (""Noah and the Whale"") plays a young newbie along for the ride. Every time I watched the trailer, I couldn't help suppress a yawn. It appeared to be too conventional to have anything new to say.

Then, a couple of weeks ago, I saw a television commercial for the film. This commercial was different; mentioning the film was directed by Richard Shepherd. Richard Shephard? The director of ""The Matador""?  ""The Matador"" was an unusual film, a dark comedy featuring great performances by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. It wasn't one of my favorite films, but I appreciated the dark, offbeat sense of humor. When I learned ""The Hunting Party"" was a dark comedy, my interest became peaked.

Simon (Richard Gere) is a danger junkie. His job as a reporter for a major television network's evening news has made him a star and he seems more comfortable wearing a pair of cargo pants and a camouflage vest, dodging bullets, than he would be at a dinner party enjoying conversation. His cameraman, Duck (Terrence Howard), has been with Simon for a lot of years and also gets an adrenaline hit from the danger, a rush he has become addicted to. Then, one day, Simon loses it. On live television. He is fired and Duck returns to New York to become the personal cameraman for the network's news anchor Franklin Harris (James Brolin, doing a fun riff on Dan Rather). Five years later, Franklin and Duck return to Sarajevo to cover the ceremonies surrounding the anniversary of the end of the war in the Balkans. They take along Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg), the son of a network VP. Upon their arrival in Sarajevo, Duck immediately runs into Simon who now travels to various war zones doing freelance reports for any network that will pay for it. Simon has a crazy idea. He knows where ""The Fox"", one of the most wanted war criminals, is and thinks they should go and try to get an interview, traveling into a very unsafe Serb area under the criminal's control. It hasn't escaped Simon's attention that there is a $5 million dollar reward for The Fox. He could sure use the money.

""The Hunting Party"" is based on a true story involving Sebastian Junger, the celebrated reporter and author of such books as ""The Perfect Storm"" and many Vanity Fair articles delving into the politics and history behind various war zones. Simon is based on Junger and some of his associates, who apparently came up with the idea of trying to capture a real war criminal in the Czech Republic while drunk. As the story unfolds, there are some outright hilarious moments as Simon, Duck and Benjamin prove they have more intelligence in their head than any of the UN forces charged with keeping the peace in the region. The US Government? Forget about it. After they get in a scrape, Simon and his friends are rescued by Chet (Dylan Baker), a member of an elite Spec Ops force of the US Government. Chet proves he is all bravado very quickly.

""Hunting"" is about male bonding. Simon and Duck are friends, have lived through a lot together and are sad when events pull their friendship apart. Because this friendship lives in war zones, they also get an adrenaline high from the friendship, and the danger they face on a consistent basis. It is a sort of win-win relationship for them. When they are reunited haphazardly, you can see the relief on Simon's face and the joy on Duck's. Duck has been living a safe life in New York, as the cameraman for the network anchor. When he sees Simon, in Sarajevo, he immediately starts to think back to the life he once had, filled with danger and excitement. When Simon sees Duck, he realizes his friend has returned, he has someone to talk to, someone to help him, after being alone for a long period of time.

Each initially regards Benjamin as an interloper, a newbie, something they have to tolerate. He has led a sheltered life and he seems to regard the potential for danger as a new and thrilling chance to do something exciting with his life.

I have never been a huge fan of Richard Gere. But with his last few films, he is growing on me. In ""The Hoax"" he played Clifford Irving, a complex character and actually did a very good job. He was able to make his version of this real life person real to me. Now with his role in ""The Hunting Party"", he goes two for two. As we watch Simon, we get a real sense of his character's complete life. There is a brief segment at the beginning of the film, narrated by Duck, giving us an overview of their relationship to the point when he has his breakdown on national TV. As he does his live report, we see the pain in his eyes from all of the horror he has witnessed. Even though we have just seen brief snippets, we understand how he could have this breakdown. As soon as he and Duck are reunited, a wash of relief crosses his face. After five years of covering stories alone, in horrible war zones, he finally has a familiar and friendly face to deal with, a companion.

Then, when he announces his plan to Duck and Benjamin, we understand why he would consider such a deadly thing. He needs the money, he needs the excitement, and he needs the camaraderie. It is a nice turn from Gere.

Terrence Howard is also very good. From the opening frames, it is his voice narrating the moments we watch from their friendship. His lighthearted tone reveals a lot about how they really need each other.

Then, when Duck and Simon reunite in Sarajevo, Duck has become comfortable, but bored in his cushy job. As Simon reveals his plans, Duck is, at first, incredulous, but quickly jumps on board. He even goes so far as to postpone his meeting with a beautiful girl in Greece, a trip planned for after the coverage of the festivities in Sarajevo. The prospect of spending time with his friend, spending time alluding danger, is more attractive to him than spending time in Greece with a beautiful woman.

As Benjamin, Jesse Eisenberg is able to portray the new kid, adding an additional level to the relationship between the three men. Everything happening to them happens through his eyes for the first time. He is amazed, shocked, scared and overjoyed to be living this adventure. He doesn't hesitate to mention he earned a degree from Harvard, which is also his battle cry for adventure. His life has been so sheltered, for so long he needs this to really come alive.

""Hunting"" is funny and also an adventure. There are moments of ridiculous behavior and some very funny dialogue as the characters deal with all of the madness surrounding them. It is a dark comedy, which means there are also moments of seriousness, drama and danger. Combined together, they create a very interesting, watch able film. A much better film than the trailer would lead you to believe.",1189728000,38,7421,4.599395313681028

2987570,5,B000WMFZN8,"The ""Hunting Party"" was a movie I gave a B plus to the first time I watched. On second viewing I pumped it up to a B plus to an A minus. Unlike many films it gets better with a repeat viewing.

It's a dark comedy with complex nuances not appreciated by casual viewers. In fact, if you want to watch this while surfing the Web or doing something else forget about it. You will miss vital moments and then think the movie wasn't that good. Or, maybe you'll watch it all and still think that but that is why reviews are subjective.

Tale focuses on a man nicknamed Duck (Terence Howard) who is in a high position for a network but secretly misses his days as a camera man when he and his former buddy, Simon (Richard Gere), went through dangerous areas of the world to report to the world. But it all fell apart in the middle of the Bosnian War when Simon lost it during a live report and after that debacle was removed from the Big Leagues. We never find out until the end of the film why Simon lost it and it's a pretty good reason once you hear it from the perspective of Duck.

And speaking Duck it's his story as he is the one choosing when to narrate and when to not do so.

It's years later and Duck returns to Bosnia after the war has ended yet various leading criminals have yet to be caught and the question is raised as to whether the United Nations is really trying that hard to get them. Along with Duck is a young intern just out of Harvard (played by Jesse Eisenberg), who got the position because his father is an important executive.

What then follows is Simon linking up with the two and convincing them both to travel into the heart of Bosnia to find one of the most vile criminals, nicknamed The Fox. At first you think they're doing it for the five million dollar reward but not surprisingly you find out other factors are involved in the equation.

As this is a dark comedy it toes the line from dark humor to utter seriousness. Sometimes it does a fine job of doing it well and other times, well, it's open to opinion.
That said, this picture is an interesting buddy picture which focuses on a dark part of our History and makes some valid points we should be thinking over.

The acting by the three people mentioned is absolutely awesome. Their interplay from serious to comedic lines flows well and you truly feel Duck and Simon care about one another even though their paths have differed later on.

This film had mixed reviews and a low Box Office turnout (even in Bosnia) which doesn't surprise me based on the depressing subject matter. The budget was about $60M and it made just under $1M at the Box Office. As I've said in previous reviews Americans don't like to watch the serious stuff. To be fair I didn't care to see this film until somebody told me about it, too.

The End Credits show what truly existed from this tale and you discover that some of the more ""ridiculous"" elements actually happened.

Loosely based on an Esquire article by Scott Anderson in which a group of journalists decide to try and find a war criminal, Radovan Karadzi, ""The Butcher of Bosnia"". Cameos by some of those people in this picture.

2987574,3,B000WMFZN8,"""The Hunting Party"" is a film where the believable and unbelievable combine to provide a narrative that is interesting, yet the story is dented by how far-fetched a few events are. Nevertheless the good parts outweigh the bad.

Veteran journalist Simon Hunt (Richard Gere) and cameraman Duck (Terrence Howard) covered some of the world's worst hotspots during the 1990's before Simon had a meltdown whilst covering the Balkans Conflict. He essentially disappeared but when Duck returns to the region to cover new events he suspects that Simon might be lingering in the shadows.

When Duck's suspicions prove to be correct Simon appears and is able to convince him to seek out a wanted war criminal, The Fox, and they are joined by graduate journalist Benjamin Strauss (Jesse Eisenberg). It is their brushes with danger and understanding why Simon is chasing The Fox so urgently, which provides plenty of entertaining scenes.

Richard Gere plays the role of journalist Simon Hunt with authenticity and his energy as a reporter on a mission for justice makes this character likeable and engaging. Duck is the reluctant but always willing partner, and graduate journalist Benjamin Strauss makes up for his inexperience with plenty of initiative.

The film fictionalizes many real events and situations from the Balkans Conflict and brings attention to the lack of intervention from the international community towards the war, and efforts to track down war criminals.

2987575,4,B000WMFZN8,"Although there is so much in here, I found the ending (SPOILER ALERT) where the three journalists decide to run away from the CIA as implausible as well as their ability to capture, on their own, a notorious Serb war criminal.

Having said that, at the end of the movie, are claims that this actually happened. If that's true then the depiction of the final 20 minutes of this movie was even more unbelievable.

It's hard to know what to think but up until that point this is a terrific thriller with loads of mysterious threatening characters and scenes. The acting is first-rate as when Richard Gere gets those indignant roles he is always able to pull those off. Throw in Terrence Howard who just exudes cool and the surprising newcomer ""Adventureland's"" Jesse Eisenberg. Throw in a gratuitous James Brolin (sadly his beard demanded too much salary and did not appear in a suppurting role), loads of war scenes and bombed out building across Bosnia-Hercegovina and you have one heckuva movie.

Maybe not as well done as ""Savior"" was as far as depicting the atrocities in the Balkans but a damned fine effort.

2987576,3,B000WMFZN8,"Whether or not events in the movie were based on some actual facts, the story comes off very unconvincingly, it smacks of Hollywood and finally falls just short of being entertaining.  It does nothing toward educating audiences on root causes of the war, of which many people are completely oblivious - not that that was the point of the film, but with good guys and bad guys in such perfect black and white, you might as well have been watching a Chuck Norris film.  Except in a Chuck Norris film you'd be more likely to believe all the utterly nonsensical events leading up to the heroes eventual victory.

2987581,1,B000WMFZN8,"The Hunting Party seems to be the latest Serb-bashing film to come out of Hollywood. A Croatian-American production, it is drenched in bias from start to finish. The film attempts to portray the efforts of three stooge-like journalists who decide to capture Bosnian Serb Dr. Radoslav Bogdanovic, a.k.a. the ""Fox"", (a fictitious character drawn up to resemble a cross between Bosnian Serb leaders Dr. Radovan Karadjic and General Radko Mladic). The film starts off poorly from the beginning and continues its downfall all the way to the very bottom.
Specifically:
1) It is the same old/usual clichs involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: the Serbs (surprisingly there were no Russians or Germans in this one...).  Can we not find something more original than the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Russian ""boogieman"" (or the USUAL German/Nazi ""bad guy"" clich for that matter), together with the leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Anglo-Americans?  Is that too much to ask?
2) Bad choice of actors. The much aged Richard Gere does not live up to expectations in his role as Simon Hunt. Moreover, the choices of Terrence Howard and Jesse Eisenberg for Duck and Benjamin respectively were poor at best with disheartening performances that fail to convince.
3) The film justifies the unjustifiable: vigilantism and revenge. Instead of helping heal the wounds from the Balkan conflicts, it is instead inflammatory fueling hatred and condoning revanchism.
4) Weak car chases and poor action scenes serve more to annoy than to entertain.
5) The not-so-hidden and rather dangerous political and ""moral"" (or lack of...) messages included in the film, plot/storyline for which the writers are to blame.
There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda!
On the other hand:
1) The film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act.
2) It is indicative of the deal that Richard Holbrooke made with Dr. Radovan Karadjic in promising immunity in exchange for the Bosnian Serb leader stepping down, which the former is now vehemently (though unconvincingly) denies.
In short, the film is racist and offensive, insulting and divisive, and shame on Richard Gere for stooping so low as to accept a role in this badly scripted film.
In conclusion, The Hunting Party follows a line of other Serb-bashing films, such as Behind Enemy Lines (Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman), Icon (Patrick Swayze), Peacemaker (George Clooney), and Welcome to Sarajevo (Woody Harrelson).

The satire and the depth of the roles played by Richard Gere and Terence Howard was expertly handled with nuance and credibility.

Joseph Goebbels of Hitler's Germany looks like an amature when it comes to CNN and BBC and.
Unfotunatelly most of regular americans are so dumb that they belive anything they see on TV and accept as the only ""truth"" not taking the view from the ""accused"" side.

Well, let me tell you that I spent 4 years of war in Bosnia and I have seen atrocities from all sides involved in that war. I have seen Serbian women and children killed and raped by muslims. 10,000 Serbs are either killed or missing in Sarajevo alone but no Western Media will show that.
Well this so called movie does not tell that story becuase Serbs are labeled in the muslim and Western media as the aggressors of their own land Bosnia where they lived for centuries, and are labeled as the only killers in that war.  Muslims, who are actually America's biggest enemy (not to mention that Osama Bin Laden was at the Sarajevo Airport in 2002)are shown as innocent victims in this movie.
You may ask why is this so that only Serbs are shown as the bad guys. Well the answer is simple. America is the strongest nation in the world and they decide who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. But why Serbs? Why Serbs who have always been America's allied in both WW1 and WW2 while muslims and Croats were collaborating with Germany and Hitler. Well bosnian muslims (former Serbs, that converted to islam during Ottoman Empire) are strongly supported by rich Middle Eastern Islamic Fundamentalist such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE and so on. THeir goal is to create an Islamic country in Europe and then spread further. Unfortunatelly America does not have friends or enemies. It only has interests. And their interest is cheaper oil reserves from Islamic countries and in return it has to protect muslims in Bosnia.
I am not saying that Serbs did not do any crimes but so did the muslims and the croats but you will never see such a Movie in Hollywood!",1217980800,7,2157,4.514066496163683

Slobodan Milosevic served as the President of Serbia from 1989 until 1997 and as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. He also led Serbia's Socialist Party from its foundation in 1990. During the Serbian war, Milosevic ordered a program of ethnic cleansing of the Kosovo Albanians that drove hundreds of thousands of them into neighboring countries as refugees. Women were raped then murdered, and children were slaughtered.

Milosevic was arrested by Serbian authorities in 2001 on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. However, the initial investigation into Milosevic faltered for lack of hard evidence prompting the Serbian Prime Minister to send him to The Hague to stand trial on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

The trial began in February 2002 but experienced numerous delays because of the poor health of Milosevic, who served as his own defense lawyer. On March 11, 2006, he was found dead in his prison cell. It is believed that he died of a heart attack.

Milosevic's right hand man, known as `The Fox', and the subject of this film, was at the time the most wanted man by the UN and the United States. However, no effort was done to capture him, as shown in this movie. His whereabouts were known by both the UN and the United States, but it was believed that a secret agreement was drawn between `The Fox' and the CIA that guaranteed his freedom.

Simon (played by Richard Gere) is an award winning journalist whose Albanian girlfriend is raped and killed by the armies of `The Fox'. He vows revenge. After the war in the Balkans is over, he returns to Sarajevo to find `The Fox'. Together with two other journalists (there were five in real life) he tracks down `The Fox', captures him while he was hunting foxes, and delivers him to the Muslim village where his girlfriend was brutally murdered. The Muslims, recognizing `The Fox', beat him to death. So the legend says.

You will be left with one important question at the end of this movie. Does the US know the whereabouts of War criminals but does nothing about it in order to further its own agenda?

This is a great movie. Since many of us (unfortunately) do not read books, but rather prefer watching movies, it is important for film makers to make movies based on true stories. This movie will reveal the atrocities and politics of war. In war, there is no such thing as the good side: All sides are evil. The innocent suffer for the foolish ambitions of the few!",1206057600,,2809,4.708757637474542

Together Simon, Duck, and Benjamin, a newbie to the news world out to make his mark as a journalist, set out to find and capture ""The Fox"" and bring him to justice and receive the $5 million dollar reward.

Terrence Howard is an excellent addition to the cast with his great performance, but Jesse Eisenberg is the one that truly surpised me and that I really enjoyed in this movie because he was the one that lightened up the hard content of such a harsh subject matter.

This is a great action movie that leaves you with a lot to think about how human can be so evil and how others just don't want to see the facts (or simply don't care). But thankfully, you also have the ones that do care and hunt these evil persons which makes it somewhat more bearable.

2987594,1,B000WMFZN8,"The Hunting Party is a cold, disjointed film that seems to be hunting desperately for a genre to fit into.

The Hunting Party is based on a true story about three journalists (played by Richard Gere, Terrence Howard, and ) who go on a mission to interview and capture one of the most wanted war criminals in the world--the Fox. True story films usually seem to command a degree of respect, because as we watch it we know some or all of it happened to a certain degree. Despite opening with the line ""Only the most ridiculous parts of this movie are true."" I could not respect this film.

There were so many problems on so many levels I was left dumbfounded. The characters are underdeveloped, distant and impossible to relate to. The decisions they make seem almost trying to make us dislike them. The pacing and flow of the film was disorganized, chopped-up, and confusing. The entire film seemed to be random scenes of a true story tacked together to produce a story and Terrence Howard's calming narration added to the beginning and end to smooth it out and connect it.  It seemed like it was trying to be an intense thriller, a true story about impossible odds, as well as a melodrama of two men who worked together and their experiences.

Unfortunately Gere's and Howard's talented performances were wasted in this messy mechanical, melodramatic film. I love true stories, but not all true stories were meant to be turned into films.",1202256000,3,1438,4.67193675889328
2987595,4,B000WMFZN8,"All big conflicts and unresolved situations are a fertile ground for conspiracy theories. Usually one or the other urban myth will be planted on top of the most daring theories. Prime example that comes to mind are the 9/11 explanations involving Mossad/Pentagon/CIA plus the fable that x-thousand Jews did not go to work on that day, which many good Muslims actually believe. As I know first hand, i.e. this is not an urban myth now.
One conspiracy theory has it that Karadjic, the Bosnian Serb, who is one of the hottest refugees from international justice, resigned his leadership in a deal with the US/UN which promised him that they would not come after him. The urban myth garnishing this theory, and which forms the basis of this film script, is, that K. actually did get caught and then killed by Bosnian Muslims rather than put up for show like Milosevic. Who knows.
The movie is worth watching, whether one wants to belief the story or not. Gere and Howard are doing a great job as pair of war correspondents with different positions on their career path trajectory(G down, H up). The plot is interesting enough, the story is based on the two guys' hare-brained plan to interview K., who is here called something else, but played by a look-alike.

2987596,4,B000WMFZN8,"At first glance, during the music and opening sequences of THE HUNTING PARTY, it is difficult to ascertain if the film about to be seen is a comedy or a docudrama about a genocidal maniac.  Once the repartee of dialog sets in we realize that journalists require a certain mindset and vantage that allows them to cover war and other atrocities and once that tenor is adjusted the film makes solid sense.

Based on a true story by Scott Anderson (a journalist) THE HUNTING PARTY (written for the screen by Richard Shepard who also directs) deals with a top notch journalist Simon (Richard Gere) on the skids and his buddy cameraman Duck (Terrence Howard) and youngster journalist Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg) who meet up after Simon's self imposed exile to follow a lead to 'interview' The Fox (Ljubomir Kerekes), the most wanted war criminal from the Bosnia/Croatian war.  Their trail follows life-threatening chases and captures and escapes until they expose what the CIA has been doing to prevent - the capture of this heinous maniac.  While the atmosphere is rather grim, the production is pitch perfect and the performances by Gere, Howard, and Eisenberg manage to reveal the complexities of the mental states and bizarre outlooks of journalists who elect to be right next to the horrors of war and crime in order to deliver a story.  Food for thought here, and a much different approach to the life of correspondents than we've had before.  And, it is based on fact!  Grady Harp, January 08",1201392000,13,1492,4.850393700787402

2987598,5,B000WMFZN8,"The Hunting Party harkens back to a trend in the 1980s of films about journalists in war-torn Third World countries:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Fire/dp/B00005LOKX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Fire</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Fields/dp/B00004RF82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Fields</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salvador-Special-Edition/dp/B00005AUJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salvador (Special Edition)</a>. These films featured flawed reporters putting their lives on the line for hard-hitting truths and righteous causes. In the 1990s, this trend seemed to fade with a few notable exceptions like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Insider/dp/B00003CWRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Insider</a>&nbsp;but now The Hunting Party attempts to revive this type of film for our politically charged times.

For two thirds of The Hunting Party, director Richard Shepard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matador-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000EQ5UIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matador (Widescreen Edition)</a>) maintains a tense mood while injecting moments of comedy as the protagonists get closer to the Fox and find themselves, rather frighteningly, at his mercy. However, for the last third, they turn the tables on their prey. The film ends on a wonderfully cheeky note with an epilogue that lets us know what was based on fact and what was made up. Most importantly, The Hunting Party asks questions like why are notorious war criminals in Bosnia have not been caught and with apparently very little to no effort? The audience is left to ponder the answer.

There is an audio commentary with writer/director Richard Shepard. He points out that they actually shot on location in Croatia and Bosnia. In the film's opening battle scenes, Gere and Howard did their own stunts (including being precarious close to real explosions). It was important for him to shoot on location because he wanted the cast and crew to see the places where the actual events took place. Shepard delivers an engaging, chatty track that is entertaining and informative.

Also included are six deleted scenes with optional commentary by Shepard. There is an extension of a scene where we learn how Duck got his nickname. There is a nice scene where our three protagonists discuss a conspiracy theory about the Fox. Shepard is fairly candid about why this footage was cut and laments the removal of some of it.

""Making The Hunting Party"" features Shepard talking about how he wanted to make a film in a post-war city and first considered Baghdad but read a story in Esquire magazine about a group of journalists' search for a Bosnian war criminal and that inspired him to dramatize the story in a film.

""The Real Hunting Party"" features Shepard interviewing two of the journalists - John Falk and Scott Anderson - included in the Esquire article that inspired the film for 30 minutes. The two reporters talk about the actual events and come across (not surprisingly) as very personable and natural storytellers.

""What I Did On My Summer Vacation"" is the actual Esquire article and is a real nice touch that they included it on the DVD as you can now read the source material.

3222041,4,B000WMFZN8,"""Only the Most Ridiculous Parts of the Story Are True""

As I read this brief title card at the beginning of the new Richard Shephard (""The Matador"") film ""The Hunting Party"", I suddenly realized something. For months, I have been watching a trailer for a different film. Funny thing is the film I saw was better than the film promoted by the trailer. Let me explain.

Over the course of many months, I saw the trailer for ""The Hunting Party"" many times. Every time I watched it, the film was painted as a fairly typical war story. Richard Gere plays a reporter covering stories in various war zones, Terrence Howard plays his cameraman. Together, they dodge a lot of bullets and explosions. Jesse Eisenberg (""Noah and the Whale"") plays a young newbie along for the ride. Every time I watched the trailer, I couldn't help suppress a yawn. It appeared to be too conventional to have anything new to say.

Then, a couple of weeks ago, I saw a television commercial for the film. This commercial was different; mentioning the film was directed by Richard Shepherd. Richard Shephard? The director of ""The Matador""?  ""The Matador"" was an unusual film, a dark comedy featuring great performances by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. It wasn't one of my favorite films, but I appreciated the dark, offbeat sense of humor. When I learned ""The Hunting Party"" was a dark comedy, my interest became peaked.

Simon (Richard Gere) is a danger junkie. His job as a reporter for a major television network's evening news has made him a star and he seems more comfortable wearing a pair of cargo pants and a camouflage vest, dodging bullets, than he would be at a dinner party enjoying conversation. His cameraman, Duck (Terrence Howard), has been with Simon for a lot of years and also gets an adrenaline hit from the danger, a rush he has become addicted to. Then, one day, Simon loses it. On live television. He is fired and Duck returns to New York to become the personal cameraman for the network's news anchor Franklin Harris (James Brolin, doing a fun riff on Dan Rather). Five years later, Franklin and Duck return to Sarajevo to cover the ceremonies surrounding the anniversary of the end of the war in the Balkans. They take along Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg), the son of a network VP. Upon their arrival in Sarajevo, Duck immediately runs into Simon who now travels to various war zones doing freelance reports for any network that will pay for it. Simon has a crazy idea. He knows where ""The Fox"", one of the most wanted war criminals, is and thinks they should go and try to get an interview, traveling into a very unsafe Serb area under the criminal's control. It hasn't escaped Simon's attention that there is a $5 million dollar reward for The Fox. He could sure use the money.

""The Hunting Party"" is based on a true story involving Sebastian Junger, the celebrated reporter and author of such books as ""The Perfect Storm"" and many Vanity Fair articles delving into the politics and history behind various war zones. Simon is based on Junger and some of his associates, who apparently came up with the idea of trying to capture a real war criminal in the Czech Republic while drunk. As the story unfolds, there are some outright hilarious moments as Simon, Duck and Benjamin prove they have more intelligence in their head than any of the UN forces charged with keeping the peace in the region. The US Government? Forget about it. After they get in a scrape, Simon and his friends are rescued by Chet (Dylan Baker), a member of an elite Spec Ops force of the US Government. Chet proves he is all bravado very quickly.

""Hunting"" is about male bonding. Simon and Duck are friends, have lived through a lot together and are sad when events pull their friendship apart. Because this friendship lives in war zones, they also get an adrenaline high from the friendship, and the danger they face on a consistent basis. It is a sort of win-win relationship for them. When they are reunited haphazardly, you can see the relief on Simon's face and the joy on Duck's. Duck has been living a safe life in New York, as the cameraman for the network anchor. When he sees Simon, in Sarajevo, he immediately starts to think back to the life he once had, filled with danger and excitement. When Simon sees Duck, he realizes his friend has returned, he has someone to talk to, someone to help him, after being alone for a long period of time.

Each initially regards Benjamin as an interloper, a newbie, something they have to tolerate. He has led a sheltered life and he seems to regard the potential for danger as a new and thrilling chance to do something exciting with his life.

I have never been a huge fan of Richard Gere. But with his last few films, he is growing on me. In ""The Hoax"" he played Clifford Irving, a complex character and actually did a very good job. He was able to make his version of this real life person real to me. Now with his role in ""The Hunting Party"", he goes two for two. As we watch Simon, we get a real sense of his character's complete life. There is a brief segment at the beginning of the film, narrated by Duck, giving us an overview of their relationship to the point when he has his breakdown on national TV. As he does his live report, we see the pain in his eyes from all of the horror he has witnessed. Even though we have just seen brief snippets, we understand how he could have this breakdown. As soon as he and Duck are reunited, a wash of relief crosses his face. After five years of covering stories alone, in horrible war zones, he finally has a familiar and friendly face to deal with, a companion.

Then, when he announces his plan to Duck and Benjamin, we understand why he would consider such a deadly thing. He needs the money, he needs the excitement, and he needs the camaraderie. It is a nice turn from Gere.

Terrence Howard is also very good. From the opening frames, it is his voice narrating the moments we watch from their friendship. His lighthearted tone reveals a lot about how they really need each other.

Then, when Duck and Simon reunite in Sarajevo, Duck has become comfortable, but bored in his cushy job. As Simon reveals his plans, Duck is, at first, incredulous, but quickly jumps on board. He even goes so far as to postpone his meeting with a beautiful girl in Greece, a trip planned for after the coverage of the festivities in Sarajevo. The prospect of spending time with his friend, spending time alluding danger, is more attractive to him than spending time in Greece with a beautiful woman.

As Benjamin, Jesse Eisenberg is able to portray the new kid, adding an additional level to the relationship between the three men. Everything happening to them happens through his eyes for the first time. He is amazed, shocked, scared and overjoyed to be living this adventure. He doesn't hesitate to mention he earned a degree from Harvard, which is also his battle cry for adventure. His life has been so sheltered, for so long he needs this to really come alive.

""Hunting"" is funny and also an adventure. There are moments of ridiculous behavior and some very funny dialogue as the characters deal with all of the madness surrounding them. It is a dark comedy, which means there are also moments of seriousness, drama and danger. Combined together, they create a very interesting, watch able film. A much better film than the trailer would lead you to believe.",1189728000,38,7421,4.599395313681028

3222067,5,B000WMFZN8,"The ""Hunting Party"" was a movie I gave a B plus to the first time I watched. On second viewing I pumped it up to a B plus to an A minus. Unlike many films it gets better with a repeat viewing.

It's a dark comedy with complex nuances not appreciated by casual viewers. In fact, if you want to watch this while surfing the Web or doing something else forget about it. You will miss vital moments and then think the movie wasn't that good. Or, maybe you'll watch it all and still think that but that is why reviews are subjective.

Tale focuses on a man nicknamed Duck (Terence Howard) who is in a high position for a network but secretly misses his days as a camera man when he and his former buddy, Simon (Richard Gere), went through dangerous areas of the world to report to the world. But it all fell apart in the middle of the Bosnian War when Simon lost it during a live report and after that debacle was removed from the Big Leagues. We never find out until the end of the film why Simon lost it and it's a pretty good reason once you hear it from the perspective of Duck.

And speaking Duck it's his story as he is the one choosing when to narrate and when to not do so.

It's years later and Duck returns to Bosnia after the war has ended yet various leading criminals have yet to be caught and the question is raised as to whether the United Nations is really trying that hard to get them. Along with Duck is a young intern just out of Harvard (played by Jesse Eisenberg), who got the position because his father is an important executive.

What then follows is Simon linking up with the two and convincing them both to travel into the heart of Bosnia to find one of the most vile criminals, nicknamed The Fox. At first you think they're doing it for the five million dollar reward but not surprisingly you find out other factors are involved in the equation.

As this is a dark comedy it toes the line from dark humor to utter seriousness. Sometimes it does a fine job of doing it well and other times, well, it's open to opinion.
That said, this picture is an interesting buddy picture which focuses on a dark part of our History and makes some valid points we should be thinking over.

The acting by the three people mentioned is absolutely awesome. Their interplay from serious to comedic lines flows well and you truly feel Duck and Simon care about one another even though their paths have differed later on.

This film had mixed reviews and a low Box Office turnout (even in Bosnia) which doesn't surprise me based on the depressing subject matter. The budget was about $60M and it made just under $1M at the Box Office. As I've said in previous reviews Americans don't like to watch the serious stuff. To be fair I didn't care to see this film until somebody told me about it, too.

The End Credits show what truly existed from this tale and you discover that some of the more ""ridiculous"" elements actually happened.

Veteran journalist Simon Hunt (Richard Gere) and cameraman Duck (Terrence Howard) covered some of the world's worst hotspots during the 1990's before Simon had a meltdown whilst covering the Balkans Conflict. He essentially disappeared but when Duck returns to the region to cover new events he suspects that Simon might be lingering in the shadows.

When Duck's suspicions prove to be correct Simon appears and is able to convince him to seek out a wanted war criminal, The Fox, and they are joined by graduate journalist Benjamin Strauss (Jesse Eisenberg). It is their brushes with danger and understanding why Simon is chasing The Fox so urgently, which provides plenty of entertaining scenes.

Richard Gere plays the role of journalist Simon Hunt with authenticity and his energy as a reporter on a mission for justice makes this character likeable and engaging. Duck is the reluctant but always willing partner, and graduate journalist Benjamin Strauss makes up for his inexperience with plenty of initiative.

The film fictionalizes many real events and situations from the Balkans Conflict and brings attention to the lack of intervention from the international community towards the war, and efforts to track down war criminals.

Having said that, at the end of the movie, are claims that this actually happened. If that's true then the depiction of the final 20 minutes of this movie was even more unbelievable.

It's hard to know what to think but up until that point this is a terrific thriller with loads of mysterious threatening characters and scenes. The acting is first-rate as when Richard Gere gets those indignant roles he is always able to pull those off. Throw in Terrence Howard who just exudes cool and the surprising newcomer ""Adventureland's"" Jesse Eisenberg. Throw in a gratuitous James Brolin (sadly his beard demanded too much salary and did not appear in a suppurting role), loads of war scenes and bombed out building across Bosnia-Hercegovina and you have one heckuva movie.

3222078,1,B000WMFZN8,"The Hunting Party seems to be the latest Serb-bashing film to come out of Hollywood. A Croatian-American production, it is drenched in bias from start to finish. The film attempts to portray the efforts of three stooge-like journalists who decide to capture Bosnian Serb Dr. Radoslav Bogdanovic, a.k.a. the ""Fox"", (a fictitious character drawn up to resemble a cross between Bosnian Serb leaders Dr. Radovan Karadjic and General Radko Mladic). The film starts off poorly from the beginning and continues its downfall all the way to the very bottom.
Specifically:
1) It is the same old/usual clichs involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: the Serbs (surprisingly there were no Russians or Germans in this one...).  Can we not find something more original than the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Russian ""boogieman"" (or the USUAL German/Nazi ""bad guy"" clich for that matter), together with the leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Anglo-Americans?  Is that too much to ask?
2) Bad choice of actors. The much aged Richard Gere does not live up to expectations in his role as Simon Hunt. Moreover, the choices of Terrence Howard and Jesse Eisenberg for Duck and Benjamin respectively were poor at best with disheartening performances that fail to convince.
3) The film justifies the unjustifiable: vigilantism and revenge. Instead of helping heal the wounds from the Balkan conflicts, it is instead inflammatory fueling hatred and condoning revanchism.
4) Weak car chases and poor action scenes serve more to annoy than to entertain.
5) The not-so-hidden and rather dangerous political and ""moral"" (or lack of...) messages included in the film, plot/storyline for which the writers are to blame.
There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda!
On the other hand:
1) The film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act.
2) It is indicative of the deal that Richard Holbrooke made with Dr. Radovan Karadjic in promising immunity in exchange for the Bosnian Serb leader stepping down, which the former is now vehemently (though unconvincingly) denies.
In short, the film is racist and offensive, insulting and divisive, and shame on Richard Gere for stooping so low as to accept a role in this badly scripted film.
In conclusion, The Hunting Party follows a line of other Serb-bashing films, such as Behind Enemy Lines (Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman), Icon (Patrick Swayze), Peacemaker (George Clooney), and Welcome to Sarajevo (Woody Harrelson).

The satire and the depth of the roles played by Richard Gere and Terence Howard was expertly handled with nuance and credibility.

Joseph Goebbels of Hitler's Germany looks like an amature when it comes to CNN and BBC and.
Unfotunatelly most of regular americans are so dumb that they belive anything they see on TV and accept as the only ""truth"" not taking the view from the ""accused"" side.

Well, let me tell you that I spent 4 years of war in Bosnia and I have seen atrocities from all sides involved in that war. I have seen Serbian women and children killed and raped by muslims. 10,000 Serbs are either killed or missing in Sarajevo alone but no Western Media will show that.
Well this so called movie does not tell that story becuase Serbs are labeled in the muslim and Western media as the aggressors of their own land Bosnia where they lived for centuries, and are labeled as the only killers in that war.  Muslims, who are actually America's biggest enemy (not to mention that Osama Bin Laden was at the Sarajevo Airport in 2002)are shown as innocent victims in this movie.
You may ask why is this so that only Serbs are shown as the bad guys. Well the answer is simple. America is the strongest nation in the world and they decide who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. But why Serbs? Why Serbs who have always been America's allied in both WW1 and WW2 while muslims and Croats were collaborating with Germany and Hitler. Well bosnian muslims (former Serbs, that converted to islam during Ottoman Empire) are strongly supported by rich Middle Eastern Islamic Fundamentalist such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE and so on. THeir goal is to create an Islamic country in Europe and then spread further. Unfortunatelly America does not have friends or enemies. It only has interests. And their interest is cheaper oil reserves from Islamic countries and in return it has to protect muslims in Bosnia.

I think a brief history is necessary in order to understand the movie and the atrocities of war. Slobodan Milosevic served as the President of Serbia from 1989 until 1997 and as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. He also led Serbia's Socialist Party from its foundation in 1990. During the Serbian war, Milosevic ordered a program of ethnic cleansing of the Kosovo Albanians that drove hundreds of thousands of them into neighboring countries as refugees. Women were raped then murdered, and children were slaughtered.

Milosevic was arrested by Serbian authorities in 2001 on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. However, the initial investigation into Milosevic faltered for lack of hard evidence prompting the Serbian Prime Minister to send him to The Hague to stand trial on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

The trial began in February 2002 but experienced numerous delays because of the poor health of Milosevic, who served as his own defense lawyer. On March 11, 2006, he was found dead in his prison cell. It is believed that he died of a heart attack.

Milosevic's right hand man, known as `The Fox', and the subject of this film, was at the time the most wanted man by the UN and the United States. However, no effort was done to capture him, as shown in this movie. His whereabouts were known by both the UN and the United States, but it was believed that a secret agreement was drawn between `The Fox' and the CIA that guaranteed his freedom.

Simon (played by Richard Gere) is an award winning journalist whose Albanian girlfriend is raped and killed by the armies of `The Fox'. He vows revenge. After the war in the Balkans is over, he returns to Sarajevo to find `The Fox'. Together with two other journalists (there were five in real life) he tracks down `The Fox', captures him while he was hunting foxes, and delivers him to the Muslim village where his girlfriend was brutally murdered. The Muslims, recognizing `The Fox', beat him to death. So the legend says.

You will be left with one important question at the end of this movie. Does the US know the whereabouts of War criminals but does nothing about it in order to further its own agenda?

This is a great movie. Since many of us (unfortunately) do not read books, but rather prefer watching movies, it is important for film makers to make movies based on true stories. This movie will reveal the atrocities and politics of war. In war, there is no such thing as the good side: All sides are evil.

The Hunting Party is based on a true story about three journalists (played by Richard Gere, Terrence Howard, and ) who go on a mission to interview and capture one of the most wanted war criminals in the world--the Fox. True story films usually seem to command a degree of respect, because as we watch it we know some or all of it happened to a certain degree. Despite opening with the line ""Only the most ridiculous parts of this movie are true."" I could not respect this film.

There were so many problems on so many levels I was left dumbfounded. The characters are underdeveloped, distant and impossible to relate to. The decisions they make seem almost trying to make us dislike them. The pacing and flow of the film was disorganized, chopped-up, and confusing. The entire film seemed to be random scenes of a true story tacked together to produce a story and Terrence Howard's calming narration added to the beginning and end to smooth it out and connect it.  It seemed like it was trying to be an intense thriller, a true story about impossible odds, as well as a melodrama of two men who worked together and their experiences.

Prime example that comes to mind are the 9/11 explanations involving Mossad/Pentagon/CIA plus the fable that x-thousand Jews did not go to work on that day, which many good Muslims actually believe. As I know first hand, i.e. this is not an urban myth now.
One conspiracy theory has it that Karadjic, the Bosnian Serb, who is one of the hottest refugees from international justice, resigned his leadership in a deal with the US/UN which promised him that they would not come after him. The urban myth garnishing this theory, and which forms the basis of this film script, is, that K. actually did get caught and then killed by Bosnian Muslims rather than put up for show like Milosevic. Who knows.
The movie is worth watching, whether one wants to belief the story or not. Gere and Howard are doing a great job as pair of war correspondents with different positions on their career path trajectory(G down, H up). The plot is interesting enough, the story is based on the two guys' hare-brained plan to interview K., who is here called something else, but played by a look-alike.

Once the repartee of dialog sets in we realize that journalists require a certain mindset and vantage that allows them to cover war and other atrocities and once that tenor is adjusted the film makes solid sense.

Based on a true story by Scott Anderson (a journalist) THE HUNTING PARTY (written for the screen by Richard Shepard who also directs) deals with a top notch journalist Simon (Richard Gere) on the skids and his buddy cameraman Duck (Terrence Howard) and youngster journalist Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg) who meet up after Simon's self imposed exile to follow a lead to 'interview' The Fox (Ljubomir Kerekes), the most wanted war criminal from the Bosnia/Croatian war.  Their trail follows life-threatening chases and captures and escapes until they expose what the CIA has been doing to prevent - the capture of this heinous maniac.  While the atmosphere is rather grim, the production is pitch perfect and the performances by Gere, Howard, and Eisenberg manage to reveal the complexities of the mental states and bizarre outlooks of journalists who elect to be right next to the horrors of war and crime in order to deliver a story.  Food for thought here, and a much different approach to the life of correspondents than we've had before.  And, it is based on fact!  Grady Harp, January 08",1201392000,13,1492,4.850393700787402

3222095,5,B000WMFZN8,"The Hunting Party harkens back to a trend in the 1980s of films about journalists in war-torn Third World countries:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Fire/dp/B00005LOKX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Fire</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Fields/dp/B00004RF82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Fields</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salvador-Special-Edition/dp/B00005AUJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salvador (Special Edition)</a>.

For two thirds of The Hunting Party, director Richard Shepard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matador-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000EQ5UIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matador (Widescreen Edition)</a>) maintains a tense mood while injecting moments of comedy as the protagonists get closer to the Fox and find themselves, rather frighteningly, at his mercy. However, for the last third, they turn the tables on their prey. The film ends on a wonderfully cheeky note with an epilogue that lets us know what was based on fact and what was made up. Most importantly, The Hunting Party asks questions like why are notorious war criminals in Bosnia have not been caught and with apparently very little to no effort? The audience is left to ponder the answer.

There is an audio commentary with writer/director Richard Shepard. He points out that they actually shot on location in Croatia and Bosnia. In the film's opening battle scenes, Gere and Howard did their own stunts (including being precarious close to real explosions). It was important for him to shoot on location because he wanted the cast and crew to see the places where the actual events took place. Shepard delivers an engaging, chatty track that is entertaining and informative.

Also included are six deleted scenes with optional commentary by Shepard. There is an extension of a scene where we learn how Duck got his nickname. There is a nice scene where our three protagonists discuss a conspiracy theory about the Fox. Shepard is fairly candid about why this footage was cut and laments the removal of some of it.

""Making The Hunting Party"" features Shepard talking about how he wanted to make a film in a post-war city and first considered Baghdad but read a story in Esquire magazine about a group of journalists' search for a Bosnian war criminal and that inspired him to dramatize the story in a film.

""The Real Hunting Party"" features Shepard interviewing two of the journalists - John Falk and Scott Anderson - included in the Esquire article that inspired the film for 30 minutes. The two reporters talk about the actual events and come across (not surprisingly) as very personable and natural storytellers.

""What I Did On My Summer Vacation"" is the actual Esquire article and is a real nice touch that they included it on the DVD as you can now read the source material.
