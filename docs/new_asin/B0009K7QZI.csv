2296702,5,B0009K7QZI,"I've watched The OC since the Pilot and have been like it's number 1 fan so when the DVD's started coming out I immediatly snatched them up. The drama, the humour, the beautiful people who could not love The OC. The Episodes are amazing, like The Escape, set in Tiajuana, or The La with Paris Hilton, or The Rager, featuring the first appearance of Dukes of Hazzard (movie) star Nikki Griffin. But there are awesome stuff too like featurettes on casting for the OC, and The REAL OC, or hidden easter eggs like deleted scenes of episodes like The Heartbreak. So buy all 51 episodes of The OC Season's 1&2 a must have for every Orange County fan looking for a little drama in there lives.",1131580800,2,686,4.4523809523809526

2296708,5,B0009K7QZI,"The OC is one of the few shows on television where I care if I miss an episode because not only do you miss lots of action but I thoroughly enjoy watching it! In some shows now there are particualr characters that you want to see more of but with this show each characters storyline is so interesting that you want to see all of them. Sure, I have my favourites, mainly Seth and Summer, but even the adults storylines are gripping! It's my favourite tv show and I look forward everyday to sitting down and watching an episode and you can do that with these boxsets! The two coming together is not only cheaper but it's better! They will both be the same and have the same number of discs and it's just more convienent! The two boxes have all the episodes but season 1 first! It has all 27 episodes which are:""The Pilot,The Model Home,The Gamble,The Debut,The Outsider,The Girlfriend,The Escape,The Rescue,The Heights,The Perfect Couple,The Homecoming,The Secret,The Best Chrismukkah Ever,The Countdown,The Third Wheel,The Links,The Rivals,The Truth,The Heartbreak,The Telenovela,The Goodbye Girl,The L.A.,The Nana,The Proposal,The Shower,The Strip and The Ties That Bind"". The Special Features are:Commentary on The Pilot by Creator Josh Schwartz and producer Stephane Savage, On Screen Music Track Guide viewing on 6 episodes,Unaired scenes,Featurette on casting,Featurette on the music used in series,Inside the real OC with executive producer McG and Season 2 sneak peak! This season is spread out over 7 discs! IT is the classic season which brought us words like 'Chrismukkah' and 'Yogalates'! Now onto Season 2! This box includes all 24 episodes which are: ""The Distance,The Way We Were,The New Kids on the Block,The New Era,The SnO.C,The Chrismukkah That Almost Wasn't,The Family Ties,The Power of Love,The Ex-Factor,The Accomplice,The Second Chance,The Lonely Hearts Club,The Test,The Rainy Day Women,The Mallpisode,The Blaze of Glory, The Brothers Grim,The Risky Business,The Rager,The O.C Confidential,

This season is also laid out on 7 discs making the total number of discs 14 which is not bad at all considering there are 51 episodes and loads of extra features! I would reccommend this tv show to anyone who likes programmes such as 'Friends' or 'Desperate Housewives' because it has something different to every other show. It's addictive and try as you might but after one episode you WILL be hooked! What else can I say but 'California Here We Come'!!!",1124755200,3,2862,5.210412147505423

2296710,5,B0009K7QZI,The OC is the best show ever! You get really into it! It is also reallly exciting because I live in Newport Beach and I have seen most of the places in Newport they film on the OC. It is the best teenage show on TV ever!,1117065600,4,220,3.702127659574468
8062414,4,B0009K7QZI,So far so good with the discs having no scrapes or any skipping problems but I was disappointed that the second season didn't come with its box,1391731200,,143,4.333333333333333
8062415,4,B0009K7QZI,"The DVD's came in really good shape. However, I consider ""Like New"" to still be in the box set unless stated otherwise. The DVD's were sent in sleeves and not the original packaging, which I would have preferred.",1306972800,,212,4.605263157894737
8062416,4,B0009K7QZI,"Alright, a dislcaimer up front - this is NOT usually my type of show, at all. I'm a big fan of LOST and 24 and Battlestar Galactica. So I really didn't expect to like this show at all. But when it first came out, there was so much positive critical response to it, that I thought I would give it a shot.

I was blown away ... not so much by the shenanigans of the teenage characters, but by the adult cast and their stories. And much to my further surprise, even the teen characters didn't spoil the experience for me. The first season is excellent, highly recommended. After that, the show kind of lost me.

But that first season is television viewing at its finest.",1173398400,,667,4.285714285714286
8062417,5,B0009K7QZI,"What ever makes the teenagers happy, well this sure did... seasons one and two... according the 17 year old who got them.. she was going to stay up all night and watch them !  I bought them 'new' and they arrived sealed, brand new.. thank you :)",1168473600,,245,4.212765957446808

8062419,5,B0009K7QZI,"Since seeing the first episode of The OC in South Africa two years ago, its been like an addiction not to miss an episode. I like all the charactors, episodes and seasons.  You will never get bored watching the O.C. It has a great story line, and loads of added extras.  Can't wait until season four shows!!",1162425600,,307,4.368421052631579
8062420,5,B0009K7QZI,"Probably my best dvd purchase made. I have seen both seasons before, but i continue to rewatch episodes and the extras like music guides and other special features are well worth the purchase!",1155513600,,192,4.848484848484849
8062421,5,B0009K7QZI,"Well, the product and the shipping times were perfect, I appreciated to receive so quickly such a cool item.

If you like Orange County, you must get it!",1142985600,,233,4.395348837209302
8062422,5,B0009K7QZI,"Being a fan of the show I have a bias toward everything about it, but still watching each episode with the option of commentary for some episodes, it was great to hear what the creator of the show had to say about the episode as it went through. Hearing about the background that they used for a scene, or why they did this and that; it was a different view of some of the best episodes from both season 1 & 2. Even wo/ the commentary, each episode was great in it's own individual way. Quality wise, it was awesome. I watched every one on my computer, because my TV in college does not have DVD, and still the quality was just unbelieveble. Even the boxes, and the packaging of the DVD's blew me away. It's not too late to jump on ""The OC"" yet, and if you're a true fan of the show like me you should not even think twice about getting the first 2 seasons if ya haven't already!",1141603200,4,879,4.116279069767442
8062423,5,B0009K7QZI,"WOW, ever since the first episode of The OC, its been like an addiction. This is a great deal fo' sho! I especially like the first season, cuz that was when u got to know all the charactors and kind of ""grow up"" with them. Great story line and full of thrills. <3 it!",1132272000,3,267,3.962962962962963
