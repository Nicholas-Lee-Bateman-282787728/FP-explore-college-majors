8359803,5,B002AMSVJI,"I only bought this dvd set because I saw it came with a mini book about this history of wrestlemania. It's a pretty cool collectors item since it was never sold on its own. The cover is pretty much the same as the 1st wwe Encyclopedia. Each wrestlemania in the book has 2 pages of brief info about the show, & the match results, there's a few pages at the end about the Raw, Smackdown, & ECW shows, & two more pages with a list of past royal rumble winners.",1423612800,,457,4.088888888888889
