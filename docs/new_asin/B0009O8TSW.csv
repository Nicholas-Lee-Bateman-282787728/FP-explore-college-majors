Other workouts are great but don't usually have the forms and extensions that ballet has. This PNB workout is perfect because not only it's always great to see ballet dancers move, but it also gives you a GREAT cardio workout while still keeping your ballet forms.

The first part of the video is cardio. Kari teaches you a combination, broken down into steps, then you repeat the combination several times. This is a GREAT cardio workout while you still feel like you're dancing WITH professional ballet dancers. She mixes in some punches as well as some latin flavor in the combination.

The second part is the slower, more controlled workout to focus on flexibility and your core strength. She starts with standing on parallel then bring your knee up to a parallel retire, then turn out to a turned out retire. This is great because it works on your turn out muscles. Then she also does a lot of floor work. One I remember is you lie down on your stomach and either develope or ""lift"" your leg a la seconde, which is kind of like a floor barre exercise.

Now I'm going to see if I can find my old VCR and play this video again!",1315958400,,1294,4.383333333333334
