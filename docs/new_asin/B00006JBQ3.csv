7969921,5,B00006JBQ3,"While not everyone gets a chance to travel the canals of New York State and the Erie Canal (or wants to), this guide addresses the practical aspects of navigating canals. I bought the book for cruising the canal. The book is also aimed at those who want year round tips on using the canal and trials that adjoin the canal. There's a good history chapter with some historic photographs. This book is well done and one of the authors, Debbie Daino Stack, is the project coordinator for Media Artists Inc.'s award-winning PBS television series, Cruising America's Waterways. She was the program coordinator for the Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse, New York.
If you can't experience the canal by boat, or by driving along roads adjacent to it, or by walking or biking, you can now enjoy reading about it.
This book covers the canal system's evolution from an industrial transportation route to an recreational waterway. It's a good reference for preparing for your trip and also while you're on your trip. In addition to the info on mechanics of some of the unique locks, guard gates, and dams, there are suggestions for enjoying the cultural, recreational, and scenic opportunities along the canals.",1433462400,,1194,4.915841584158416

7969923,5,B00006JBQ3,Not enough of our country's historic waterways are available for cruising by boat.  Here is a concise well written travel log of a fabulous part of the interior of the U.S.  We plan to spend several summers doing precisely that !  The fun stuff is not just on the coast.,1403740800,,270,4.36
7969924,3,B00006JBQ3,"The DVD for this video was taken directly from VHS - the menus are crude and there is no scene selection. So if you stop in the middle of an episode, you'll need your DVD player's memory feature to pick up where you left off. The extra feature on how locks work is good, but the photo gallery of 19th century pictures of the canal has no captions - you don't know what you're looking at. Plus, there is no way to navigate from picture to picture. Whoever transferred this from the video needs to learn how to design DVD menus.
The material wasn't bad - it's not a history of the canal, but shows you what goes on the canal today, which is mostly recreation. They tried to keep a balance between showing neat technological features like locks, aqueducts, raised bridges, etc. and highlighting sites to visit along the canal. They feature cultural and historical attractions, but seem to think food is a cultural item -- a couple of ""interviews"" with restaurant chefs were practically infomercials. I would have liked to see more of the canal in this video, but they do a decent job of giving you an idea of what's available along the canal.",1039392000,9,1139,4.507246376811594
