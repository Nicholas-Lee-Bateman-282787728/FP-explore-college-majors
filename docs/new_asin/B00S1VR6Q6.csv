8696967,4,B00S1VR6Q6,"If you love Lucy, you'll enjoy these movies. Screwball comedy, unbelievable situations, but good for a laugh when you're stressed out. My favorite is Miss Grant Takes Richmond with William Holden.",1454371200,,196,5.354838709677419

8696971,5,B00S1VR6Q6,this was a great collection especially since you can see where they were just trying to figure out how to use lucille in comedy. the third movie was hands down the best and had some amazing comedic moments. the final movie was fun in the respect that we got to see lucille play a villain role which was very uncommon. over all this was a great collection and i enjoyed it completely.,1430611200,4,383,4.333333333333333
