8676111,5,B00N40ZFOO,"Hello,

I have purchased the ,""STAFF 2-DVD bundle"" with ASIN# B01MZ05MLG, ""Beginner Tai Chi bundle"" with ASIN# B00N40ZFOO, and ""Tai Chi Martial Applications bundle"" with ASIN# B01LYJMX4J.

I chose the YMAA website as a reference for my selections, as it is organized well and sufficiently details each product.

I have yet to watch the entirety of the 6 DVDs and 3 books, though from briefly glancing through the books and DVDs and initiating my study with the ""Tai Chi Qigong"" book and DVD, I notice consistency throughout Dr. Yang's material.

Dr. Yang's material is detailed and organized. The book's illustrations host direction arrows and brief expository captions. Dr. Yang speaks clearly with a distinct Chinese accent. The DVDs host useful captions when Dr. Yang speaks providing clarity while adapting to a Chinese accent.

I have spent approximately $150 for these three bundles and consider this a worthy investment as Dr. Yang's material is concise and professionally published.

This is a cumulative review encompassing all three bundles.

Thank you,

Satisfied Amazon and YMAA Customer
