8037890,5,B00063MCU2,"I have seen Suzanne twice live, and met her.  She is such as nice lady.  This DVD was very funny, only can Suzanne deliver the lines the way she does. Much of her material can be identified with so much.  I would like to find more DVD's of her shows.",1458777600,,250,3.96

8037895,5,B00063MCU2,"Suzanne once again is a side-stitch, soda-out-the-nose, pause-it-i'm-laughing-so-hard-i'm-missing-stuff riot in the dvd.  we saw it via netflix and bought it immediately.  her take on queer cruises, , triathalons, home depot, and cats are especially funny for any audience, queer or straight.  if you want a video that will continually  light up your day, this one works.",1247011200,,371,5.571428571428571
8037896,2,B00063MCU2,"I love Suzanne Westenhoefer's humor, but I was embarrassed for her with this DVD.  She rehashes material from ""Guaranteed Fresh"" (or perhaps that CD improved her delivery), but she seems to be straining and trying too hard.  She doesn't connect with her audience in this DVD.  There were occasional titters in the audience, but it was clear she didn't have them.  Spend your time and money on other stuff she's done that's fresher and better--or get the ""Guaranteed Fresh"" CD.",1231804800,2,476,4.9125
8037897,5,B00063MCU2,"Suzanne Westenhoefer's act is the funniest I have ever heard.  I watch a lot of comedy shows and specials with many different comedians and she is by far the funniest I have ever, EVER seen.",1185753600,2,190,4.428571428571429
