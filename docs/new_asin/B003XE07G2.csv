8407970,5,B003XE07G2,I  Gerard  Depardieu! The DVD was in perfect condition and the price was great!!,1504396800,,80,4.642857142857143
8407971,3,B003XE07G2,"Amazon & seller & DVD itself were fine.  I just really dislike this movie that I bought for the motorcycle that's used on screen.
No more Depardieu for me, ever.",1500076800,,161,4.366666666666666
8407972,1,B003XE07G2,"This movie had some good point, funny at parts. Overall it was a bad movie, some unnecessary, extraneous parts. I have enjoyed other Depardieu films in the past, this isn't on of them.",1475712000,,184,4.606060606060606
8407973,5,B003XE07G2,"An in capitalist Europe amazingly clear Communist Manifesto! In the film, the deportee in lousy pension Depardieu goes (we know, in reality, he's a millionaire and has taken refuge as a tax refugee in Putin's territory), former Slaughterhouse worker, the career path of his life goes to show pension entitlements by the effort. His previous employers were all rascals, have him either black paid nowhere logged exploited only on shabby manner. A sobering that makes him flee in the arms of his niece ""Miss Ming"", which cleverly continues to receive the pension of her long-dead father (adored Greek structures?). He escapes into her ""Art Brut"" (defined as the art of the mentally ill or social outsiders). In the end he makes the pension evidence a garbage artwork, writes a poem and is (after initial frustration) reconciled in principle with the simplicity of his pension existence. Cursed career and wayward dreams (Isabelle Adjani) ticked. Arrived in solidarity with his wife, a supermarket clerk. No film for young people who should try to take up a profession. But one for retirees who stupidly are fixed in nostalgic for their gone professions.",1437177600,,1151,5.095238095238095
8407974,5,B003XE07G2,"Sometimes when I go to my local library I just head for the foreign films aisle because: a) there is never a crowd around that part of the library, b) I do not mind reading subtitles when I watch movies and c)I love european sensibilities because they are SO differnet from the american ones.  And this film definitely meets all the criteria, not to mention that the leading role is assigned to irrepresible French actor Gerard Depardieu.

It is a story of a man who reaches his retirement age.  His entire life he had a string of unremarkable jobs and now that he is retired there is barely enough money for him and his wife to live on, in spite of the fact that his wife is still working.  As it turns, many of his former employers never turned in his wages report to the government and he is forced to collect affidavits from every place he used to work in order to secure the additional retirment income.  So at this point the movie turns into a road trip where our hero travels cross country on his ancient motorcycle from the 70s.

As he makes his way across different cities and meets many of his former employers, friends and relatives, he also comes across con artists.  There are funny parts during these adventures that are so european.  I still giggle when I think of them.  In addition to looking for his former employes, the main character has flashbacks about the events from his youth that he tried to forget and supress for decades.  There is a sorrow that stars to uncover that puts a picture together of how a person can loose their own self and life meaning in a flicker of a moment.  In the film, the story of his long supressed grief finally starts revealing itself.

For american audiences, this will be a very slow movie and therefore unexciting story.  But for the patient viewers I say, watch it to the end, because the end of this film is priceless.  We learn the side of the man who in his 60s finally finds his own voice and shows the world through his poem that there is wisdom that comes with age and that asking for forgiveness can bring a new sense of freedom and desire for life in the part of whatever is left of it.

Isabel Adjani, one of the most beautiful acresses of today makes a short appearances throughout the film.  Her classical beauty and deep blue eyes are hypnotic.  I can only think of Monica Bellucci who can rival such beauty and acting talent.  I loved this movie, but then again - it is not for everyone.  It requires certain sensibilites of the viewer to truly appreciate it.",1427068800,2,2529,4.4233261339092875
8407975,1,B003XE07G2,I love Depardieu.  This movie was awful. Actually depressing. Not sure why he even made it.  Didn't need it for his career.,1375574400,,123,4.545454545454546
8407976,2,B003XE07G2,"I just saw this film on TV, and I wouldn't tell anybody to rush to Amazon Books
and buy it. (I have just erased it.) Sometimes interesting, sometimes funny, I
thought at one point that they were just making it up as they went along.
Short scenes with different people, as Depardieu goes from place to place on his
motorcycle. Nothing particularly moving or all that interesting happens, I'd say.
Only slightly interesting, if you are a fan of Depardieu.",1359763200,,453,4.675
8407977,3,B003XE07G2,"The film color, resolution and focus are not that good. Is it intentional?

Isabelle Adjani appears in the movie only several short sections with bloody face. No question Gerard Depardieu is an excellent actor. The whole story can be very interesting but it is getting bored. It's like an experimental film.

The director complained the voice recognition system. The wife talked on the phone and the phone cannot understand the pronounciation of the last name. The director put too much time on this secene.

A funny scene is a guy talked loud on the cell phone in a restaurant. The other three cusomers started weeping, obviously they listened to all his conversation.

At the beginning the coworkers gave him the the retirement gift. The supervisor gave the speech not very impressing, very routine without emotion. The gift is a 2200 piece puzzle. It is interesting. The first day of his retirement he walked around the dinning room that remind me the bears in the zoo cage.",1355270400,2,977,4.867469879518072
