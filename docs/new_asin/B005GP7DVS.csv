4693050,4,B005GP7DVS,"I have been a fan of Dermot Mulroney since I was first introduced to him in ""A Longtime Companion"". Since then he has several different types of role showing himself to be a very versatile actor, seemingly moving with ease from drama to comedy. Here in this dark comedy, he reveals yet another facet of his talents.

But my real reason for being drawn to this movie is because of Evan Ross. Like Dermot, Evan is a young actor with an astoundingly collection of works after having over 20 different roles in various stages of production. Most of his roles have been intense dramas reflecting a masterful understanding of the classic teen to adult transformation. Of all his roles, ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" is possibly his most riveting. He won lots of praise for his role as a confused Muslim teen around the tragedy of 9/11 in ""Mooz-lum"".

""The Family Tree"" adds another deminsion to his impressive resume. It is his first dark comedic role. It is nice to see him step away from some of the other roles he has portrayed. Though he has been successful in the indie world, I firmly believe he is one role away from that mainstream role that will expand his audience further. It comes at a risk though. As good as ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" is, it probably wouldn't work with a less demanding audience. His movies have dealt with intense subject matter. And I would hate to see him pass on these types of roles because that is where he excels. Some of Pacino and DeNiro's best work like ""Panic in Needle Park"" and ""Taxi Driver"" were not made for the faint at heart.

So while there are many good reasons to see ""The Family Tree"" with solid performances from Dermot Mulroney and Hope Davis, also see it to discover the works of budding young protege, Evan Ross.",1325376000,,1759,4.5251572327044025
4693051,3,B005GP7DVS,"""I bet we're the first family ever to be fired by their therapist"" After the mother (Davis) of a severely dysfunctional family has an accident and hits her head she wakes up with memory loss. She learns what she was like and what her family life was like and the entire family gets a chance to change. This is very very funny dark comedy. By very dark I mean it opens with someone accidentally hanging himself spying on the mother in bed. From there it gets darker and more and more strange. For those that like edgy humor seen in ""Death To Smoochy"" or newer movies like ""Peep World"" and ""Super"" then this one is for you. If you are easily offended I would stay away from this one. I however thought it was very funny. The only problem was that it got a little repetitive toward the end. Overall, a very funny movie that is not for everyone. I give it a B.

I can't possibly tell you about this movie because it has so many facets to it. heart wrenching, funny, ironic, will name it and it is there. Bravo to all the actors. Read the description on the DVD selection for Amazon. Not a bad performance in the lot, not a clunker to be found just a sheer roller coaster ride of terrific.

4693061,4,B005GP7DVS,"Black comedy time! This one, presented at the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival and first reviewed by Yours Truly in June of that year, features a classically dysfunctional family: the father, a mildly frustrated mid-level manager, living in a house he can't afford; the mother, a bored do-gooder using her mother's wealth to provide her with a home and charitable projects; the daughter, a Goth teenager who talks a good game but may not be quite as tough as she sounds; the son, a gun enthusiast entertaining thoughts of suicide. This family has actually been fired by a family counselor.

Here's a roster of the actors:
  * Dermot Mulroney (""Flash of Genius"") is Dad, disheartened by his wife, confused by his daughter, and alarmed by his son's propensity for guns.
  * Hope Davis (""Charlie Bartlett"") is Mom, nursing an active hatred for her OWN mother, and having a wild fling with a neighbor.
  * Brittany Robertson (""Cherry"") is the daughter; does that classmate's Mohawk have to be quite so purple and quite so tall?
  * Max Thieriot (""Chloe"") is the son, trying to be a tough guy for the Lord.
  * Keith Carradine (""Nashville"") is their minister, who sees their son's marksmanship as a God-given talent.
  * Chi McBride (""Pushing Daisies"") is the randy neighbor whose enthusiastic lovemaking causes a life-changing accident.
  * Jane Seymour (""Wedding Crashers"") the world's worst mother/mother-in-law/grandmother.

Mom suffers a brain injury during a zesty tryst with a neighbor. When she awakens from her coma, she can only remember her husband and their early happy courtship and marriage. As family members try to adjust, they slowly come to realize that there just might be a second chance here.

This R-rated romp has fun situations, dark, dark humor, and people to care about. I really enjoyed it! I got my copy from Amazon.com.",1346198400,4,1851,4.996732026143791
8472051,1,B005GP7DVS,"This movie is like the burp after a meal, except instead of a reminder of what I ate, I got hints of a much better movie. I have a sense of what it was trying to achieve with the overall madcap wackiness and the eclectic edits. I lost my patience with it about a quarter of the way through, but stuck with it to the end because the other reviews claimed that it was worth it. I really wish those reviews were true. This movie was an utter waste of time. I do not wish this on my worst enemy, not even as mindless entertainment.",1529539200,,527,4.0285714285714285

8472053,3,B005GP7DVS,"The movie was crazy! I understand the whole off the chain suburban family. The amnesia to the wife had that suppose to provide redemption to bring the family back together. What the heck was bow wow and his homeboy suppose to be doing? How long has that freaky kid been climbing in that families tree. I agree with who ever said this needed better writing. I like the extended twist with off the chain teacher, combat priest, and  the holier than thou son who decided to be friends with punk rock kid. Theres room for polishing but not to bad.",1529193600,,543,4.43
