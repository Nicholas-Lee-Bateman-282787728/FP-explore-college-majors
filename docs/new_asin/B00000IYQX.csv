7911673,5,B00000IYQX,"as a longtime fan of ""b-movies"" and ""scream queens"", seeing a documentary about what goes on behind them was certainly an eye-opening experience. odette springer did an incredible job making this film, and raised a lot of questions in my mind. at first, i felt really guilty about watching so many of these type of movies because i never stopped to think that they were exploiting women or promoting violence towards women. it kind of disturbed me. but then julie strain came out and explained how SHE was exploiting THEM for her own personal gain, turning the tables on the whole concept. it made me think some more. ultimately, i remain a fan of a lot of these actors and filmmakers because i find what they do to be entertaining and i think they are very talented. the only aspect of this film that still bothers me is the interview with actor maria ford, because she was so gut-wrenchingly honest and raw. if she could channel the emotion she displayed in that interview into dramatic acting, she would win an oscar. i thought i was going to cry listening to her talk about her struggle. and for those familiar with ""some nudity required"", she did end up giving in to the pressure and getting breast implants after all. what a world.",1001376000,12,1237,4.601809954751131
7911674,5,B00000IYQX,"Most telling about this movie is when a director is explaining the nature of women in the Bmovie industry and his Freudian slip is ""the women in these breasts"" instead of saying, ""the women in these  films.""  This movie is a behind the scene look into the Bmovie  industry.  The narrator is Odette Springer a composer of Bmovie scores.  The story focuses on her. She tries to explain how and why she got where  she is.  The most enjoyable moments, however, is when she spends time  interviewing others in her profession.  A true gem is when Odette speaks  with the quasi-feminist director of Slumber Party Massacre III.  The  director takes pride with being able to do her job as well as any of the  ""boys"", but is horrorified when she realizes she followed the  sexist rules of a slasher flick - the girls that have sex die, and the lone  celebate tomboy lives to save the day.  There are some truly sad  moments in this documentry.  Most notable one is when scream queen Maria  Ford speaks about being degraded and objectified.  For Maria, it is a cruel  profession.  She wants to do A films but is told by an agent she must sleep  with producers in order to do so.  She refuses and in turn she can only  play strippers and prostitutes in B films.  The irony isn't lost on her,  and one can only sympathize when she describes a scene that involved erotic  aphysxiation, and the real pain she is put through for the filming.  I  got the feeling that Odette used some of the stories and tragedies of  others in the industry to make her life seem more normal - her own pains  and insecurities more acceptable to herself and to the audience.  It  was an enjoyable, albeit unsettling, look into an American mainstay. PS.  Why do slasher films always use a roman numeral system for numbering their  sequels?",958694400,23,1803,4.507788161993769
