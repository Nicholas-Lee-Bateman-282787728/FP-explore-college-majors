5853619,5,B00DSJYERA,"This series is essential to understand what is happening to any cultural product with time. Nothing is eternal, nothing is ever understood the same, nothing can outlast time itself. To say tat sounds like a common place statement, and yet so many people are still speaking of Shakespeare as being eternal, though he did not exist before his first play was performed. Not to speak of the Bible, the Quran, the Dhammapada, etc. All these books were written on one particular date and occasion, and this writing was a long process, at times a whole collection of various writings, with the exclusion of many others though similar and from the same people or source.

Conan Doyle is eternal, isn't he? Sherlock Holmes is eternal isn't he? John Watson is eternal, isn't he? And yet the BBC is doing with this fictional character what it did a long time ago, though quite more moderately in this latter case, that of Shakespeare's full production of all his plays, as recognized in the 1980s. And they do it brilliantly.

It is brilliant to set the various stories within the present modern context. Afghanistan is more interesting than the South African war. Modern taxis and automobiles are more interesting than horse-drawn vehicles or the old primitive taxis of the 1920s. It is also more interesting to have modern smart phones and tablets and portable computers than pigeons and owls. The stories speak to us directly because they are positioned in our very world.

The second element is the psychological aspect of the characters. Sherlock Holmes is described with a lot more realism in his morphine addiction or in his crooked and twisted sex life, not to speak of his infancy, childhood and parents. He is even provided with a brother who is a top civil servant of the government. Sherlock Holmes has a real personal and social density. He is at the crossroads between criminals, official police, secret services, the top and often invisible civil service and politicians. We really are in a world we know and not a world of the old days, a world that does not exist any more. Does it give more density to Sherlock Holmes? I believe so, even if at times he is a show-off and particularly redundant at that.

They also manage to give to strange events a dimension that makes them imaginable, maybe not feasible and believable but more believable than in the original stories. His death and resurrection is funny like hell and there are so many versions provided to us on the screen that we are just wondering if he really died and really resurrected or if he did not die and did not resurrect? We are just confronted to some kind of electronic game with life and death. It is funny. But on the other side he does not play on his underground jobs so much, his art of disguising himself into anything and anyone. But we can survive this loss.

The stories are also dealing with a reality we know very well. Anyone who knows about the famous plot theories about the world and all political events will be at ease in this approach which is a real marvel as for plotting the end of the enemy, of the challenger, of the shadow cast on you, of anyone and anything that is making you small and insignificant when you are world leader of anything, even drugs and crime. Of course it is in many ways absurd, but Ukraine is there to show that these politics of plotting may be quite effective at times.

Don't expect a classical series with forty-five minute episodes. The episodes are quite longer than that, even more than one hour and a half, or close to it. But they are very dynamic and you won't go to sleep on them.

The main pleasure remains that these characters are marvelously revived, recreated, adapted to our own psyche and we can maybe not fall in love with them but really appreciate their finesse, and their very perverse English humor, one of the best humors in the world. The best example is John Watson's best man's now famous speech that is just everything but a best man's speech, but really funny it is. Indeed. Just like the switch on the counter of a mega bomb.

5853620,5,B00DSJYERA,I am very impressed with the adaptation to modern London. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is the same insufferable bastage as ACDoyle penned.,1466035200,,141,5.761904761904762
5853621,3,B00DSJYERA,"Bought it because we love the series, 5 stars for that, and because we have a multi region player - but it's not widescreen, which was a big disappointment, 1 star for that. Therefore 3 stars altogether.",1445644800,,203,4.513513513513513

5853626,5,B00DSJYERA,I just loved the whole series and this edition have the commentaries which is great.  You learn so much more as to what the creators are trying to accomplish with the series when listening to them talking about why they did the modern version of Sherlock and what little gems they are trying to put into the series.  Also where their inspiration comes from.  Wish they have commentaries included in the 3rd series.  Hopefully they would do that for the 4th series when their DVD comes out after production.,1428364800,,506,4.651685393258427

5853628,1,B00DSJYERA,This product says that it is bluray but does not play on a bluray player. I contacted the company but they never responded,1424131200,,122,4.3478260869565215
5853629,1,B00DSJYERA,Do not buy these disks!!!!  They will not play in a Blu-ray player or any other type.  I have tried them in four different units.,1420070400,4,129,4.12
5853630,1,B00DSJYERA,"Buyer Beware
This product will not work for Players outside of Europe.
 Purchased this as a Christmas present for a family member. Being new to Blu-Ray I was not Experienced with Region Coding,
misinterpreting the ""Region Free"" in title to mean ""this Product is region free"".
Not owning a region B Blu-ray, the Disc's could not be watched.
Amazon did accept the return, However they added a $26 restocking penalty, in addition to the $5 return shipping fee.
This could have been avoided if they would simply change the title to read  [UK Import] [1080i /Region Free player required ]
or even if they titled it the same way as the DVD Boxed set they List as ""[Region 2 - Non USA Format]"".",1420070400,6,687,4.5772357723577235

5853632,1,B00DSJYERA,"I can confirm that this set is still not 'region-free'; none of the discs would play on any of my Blu-Ray players at home. If you are from North America, and your Blu-Ray player is too, then they will most likely not work.

I was so excited to order this on my birthday, but my dreams of spending the holidays binge re-watching Sherlock seem to have been spoiled; hopefully I'll find a set that actually works soon!",1418774400,4,415,4.3896103896103895

5853634,5,B00DSJYERA,"I couldn't be happier with this set! Anyone interested in this set most likely already knows how incredible Sherlock is, so I'll focus my review on the actual product. The box itself, as well as the individual fold out cases for each season, are beautifully designed, user friendly, and well-made. Each individual season has its own fold-out case with pictures, episode blurbs, and eye-catching designs, so the set is a fantastic item for any collector. I place high value on the packaging for products like this and am always trying to get my hands on a nice-looking box set with more to offer than some cool cover art and a plastic case, so this set has me extremely satisfied. The price might be a little high compared to what each season may cost individually, but for packaging like this, plus the photo book, this box set is well worth it.",1406851200,5,845,4.64

8597193,3,B00DSJYERA,"Got the DVD set, plays good on my Samsung DVD player, for some reason. Love the actors, stories, etc... but only three shows per season, is a rip off. Each is just redone with a voice over. Still say its worth it. Just a big letdown.",1492646400,,233,4.086956521739131
