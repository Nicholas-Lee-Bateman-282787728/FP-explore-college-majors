7751752,5,B01FRQCBV2,"Does not live quite up to the original ""old Montalbano""  but comes pretty close.  The characters are interesting and fun and the mysteries are good.  I was missing the old Detective Montalbano series when I bought the first episodes of the Young Montalbano and my husband and I have not been disappointed.  We enjoy comparing the two and so far after watching all of the Young Montalbano episodes, including 10 - 12, we have only seen one mistake regarding the Old Montalbano's life and the Young Montalbano.  It has to do with his father and his father meeting Lydia in the older series and what they imply about that now.  Still, we hope they continue this series and keep to the original Detective Montalbano's life as much as possible.  After all, this series is supposed to be when he was much younger.",1472774400,,807,4.640845070422535
7751753,5,B01FRQCBV2,Michele Riondino has done an excellent job playing young Moltalbano! All other actors have done a great job too. Five stars!!,1472688000,,125,5.0

7751756,5,B01FRQCBV2,"Gushing. i am so in love with the prequel to detective montalbano. From the bandy legs, to the hand gestures, to body language, to his love of good food, he has nailed luca zingaretti's portrayal of montalbano. The ancillary characters are on point too. U get the back story of livia and montalbano, which i like. So happy someone came up with this idea. U can't go wrong with this series",1469232000,2,388,4.47887323943662
7751757,5,B01FRQCBV2,"This,  with episodes 10-12 is my favorite Montalbano of all . . .young and old.  In each episode, three and sometimes four short stories from Camilleri's various short story collections are ingeniously combined.  The character development of the principals and their inter-relationships  show more continuity than in the previous installments.  Although the series starts with the oncoming marriage of Livia and Salvo we see, movingly, why that doesn't happen.

My only complaint is the price.  In France, at Amazon.fr., I bought the 6 episodes for 24 Euros . . .subtitled in English.  So if you have a region 2 player, that's the way to go.",1468195200,4,641,5.038095238095238

8761431,5,B01FRQCBV2,This is the beginning of Montalbano and I love this one as much as I have loved all of them so far.,1497398400,,99,3.5454545454545454

8761433,5,B01FRQCBV2,Great writing by the Italian master.,1488499200,,36,5.166666666666667
8761434,5,B01FRQCBV2,"If you're a mystery fan, do yourself a favor and get to know Salvo Montalbano. We watched all of the original series, then watched this prequel. It is perfect as a standalone series.",1483833600,,182,4.545454545454546
8761435,4,B01FRQCBV2,"The author, Camillieri, is always a joy, and this group of three episodes is well worth watching. I love the Sicilian settings and the gestures and the backgrounds and knowing looks. Something is wrong with the time line. This is a prequel. Livia says in one episode of the Zingaretti series she and Salvo have been together 8 years. It would take more than 8 years to evolve from Riondino to Zingaretti.",1478476800,,404,4.625
8761436,5,B01FRQCBV2,"Some of the existing reviews express disappointment, and claim quality has fallen off earlier episodes. I don't agree. These are just as good, and I even like the young star. The young Livia, also the subject of some complaints, I find less flashy and more real somehow.",1476662400,2,270,4.76595744680851
8761437,5,B01FRQCBV2,"Great show have watched all of the young and old montabano's.  Good stories, great scenery of Sicily.  Love the music.",1474675200,,118,4.85
