2730842,5,B000MGBSHQ,"If you are reading this, you are an obvious fan of 90210, so I don't have to explain the merits of the show..

I just wanted to say THANK YOU to the powers that be for releasing the first (and now second) season!

This show was the soundtrack to so many people's lives, and I would truly be upset if it was never released on dvd..

I can't wait for season 2 on dvd! :)",1171324800,5,368,3.88
2730843,5,B000MGBSHQ,"I'm a huge fan of this show, have been since the very first episode back in the early 90's.

What I don't understand, is why we had to wait so long for it to come on dvd and why we have to wait so long on season 2.

This show was HUGE! back in the 90's. Every tv show you can think of has been released on dvd. Even if it's only been on tv for 1 season.

Anyway, these are my thoughts.

I LOVED watching season 1 again and I can't wait till I can buy season 2!",1171065600,5,460,3.6161616161616164
2730844,5,B000MGBSHQ,"Another Aaron Spelling classic.  It's so good and I can't wait for it to come out.
In the first episode called Beach Blanket Brandon, he gets a job for the summer at a posh beach club and Brenda and Dylan face breaking up because she had a pregnancy scare and her parents find out and are mad.  For some reason, my favourite episode is Meeting Mr Pony where Brenda is in the Peach Pit right after closing time and someone breaks in.  He had a shot gun and held it to her.  Moving on isn't easy.  I also really liked Pass Not Pass when Brenda and Andrea both fall for their drama teacher and The Next Fifty Years which is the episode where Scott accidentally shoots himself.  It's a very moving episode.  Also look closely in the episode Ashes To Ashes for an extremely young Vivica A Fox.
Once again, this season hooks you in and I enjoyed this as much as the first season.  It's fun to watch all the 'kids' grow further into their characters and see the relationships and dramas in their lives unfold.  I love it a lot and know that I'll watch it a couple of times over at least.",1169856000,,1080,4.229268292682927

2730882,5,B000MGBSHQ,"I loved this series when I was younger ,now my daughter is watching it.
Received by expected time frame & way before Christmas , with was GREAT!
Looking forward to ordering more from this seller!",1484006400,,195,4.6
2730883,4,B000MGBSHQ,"This opens with Brenda frightened that she might be pregnant--and Brandon dumping nat for a 'higher paying job' with the smooth-taking Henry at the Beach club.

Never mind that unlike Nat, Henry doesn't personally care too much about these kids and their daily lives. He just sits upstairs and watches his soaps. He only mildly gets worked up when there is a robbery at the Beach Club. As soon the thieves are successfully caught he is more than happy to return to his television show.

Brenda and Dylan break up, But since he is also Brandon's friend, he still remains in her life. And he frequently comes back to the house, such as when he is badly injured in a surfing accident.

This tests their concept of friendship in very interesting ways. Cindy was a little too enthusiastic about bringing him into the house?? Papa Walsh is definently not too happy after he comes home early and catches Brenda and Dylan making out on the couch, It is not what he had in mind for 'rehabilitation'.

Ah well, at least it wasn't Cindy and Dylan...right?? I think Carol Potter and Luke Perry were around the same age in real life. They probably were attracted to each other.

 David and Kelly become brother and sister because Mel Silver and Jackie Taylor are getting married. David had spent all of first season ogling over Kelly and she was avoiding him. It is now really awkward. This provides TONS of material over the next SEVERAL seasons.

Next biggest change is that Douglas Emerson exits the series (the next fifty years). His character 'accidentally'  kills himself playing with a gun on Halloween night. But seriously, since they made that family so crazy---I don't actually believe it was an 'accident',  Uh...no.more like a last ditch cry for help when Scott lacked the number for the rap line--which Andrea is no longer staffing (hmm). We never hear about this local social service agency again either.

Scott Scanlon could have 'left' through any number of ways (joining branch of military--which IS what the actor did) . The mom  does an excellent job scaring the living daylights out of the gang. It IS Halloween after all. Weirdly, there is no follow up episode with the police investigating. It's almost like everybody expected violence...etc to occur in that particular house. It was just a matter of time.

A cowboy hat of Scott's is put into a time capsule so he is not forgotten. Which is ironic because when he was alive, nobody basically cared about him, increasingly including David. They only did this episode to explain what happened to a character. It's a step up from other TV series which just drop a character without any explanation.

An apparent spin off attempt ""Ashes to Ashes"" was never given serious consideration after an initial episode. Robinson Ashe II (Shaft himself---Richard Roundtree!!) succesfully built a gourmet popcorn empire. He then moved his family next to the Walsh's in Beverly Hills. They are happy to meet people who share their down-to-earth values. But not everybody is so eager to make nice with the Ashes.. The Ashes are African American so it actually upsets the predominantely white 'liberal' neighborhood. And when more African Americans come by.....things get tense.

I wish that they had not dropped this as soon as they brought it up. Cindy and Jim deserve friends too.

I took away a star because---like the other seasons---the music is changed. Okay, they had to do this in order to get it into production with reasonable costs. But it still is horrible It removes the classic experience. I wish there was someway which we could board a time machine and go back,  So much happened this season which builds up for others that you MUST see the ORIGINAL episodes..",1479686400,,3719,4.823899371069182

2730916,3,B000MGBSHQ,The show is fun dose of '90s drama. It's been fun reliving the decade through this soap. What's not great is the packaging the DVDs come in. It seems like whoever made this edition was rushed and careless. The episode listing didn't even match on one of the disc sets (we had to figure it out by memory of what we had seen and what we hadn't) and the inside plastic didn't even hold the discs in place.

2731021,3,B000MGBSHQ,"I give the series and Amazon 5 stars. I have Amazon Prime and this arrived in ONE DAY! I am happy for that and for the memories I have from watching this show. As for the actual set of DVD's, they are only so-so. In fact, CBS should be embarrassed to have put this set out there.

First, much of the original music is gone, replaced by generic music. I understand that a lot of shows have this problem and that it is a copyright issue. So, OK, whatever...

The second problem is the packaging. The discs are in hard plastic cases and the little holders had all broken off the hubs, leaving the DVD's loose in their cases. Luckily, there were only a couple of minor scratches on them.

The BIGGEST problem is that the picture quality is fairly low for a DVD. The CBS logo looks great, but the shows themselves look like someone had taped them off of broadcast TV. They might look good on smaller screens, but I watched it on a 46"" TV (which is normal, or even a little small these days) and it looked pretty grainy. Not to mention, when the opening titles come up, it starts, cuts off, and then starts again - this happened on ALL of the episodes.

This is the type of quality I would expect from some company putting public domain films onto burned DVD's, NOT what I expect from a company like CBS.

All in all, however, if you are a fan of the show it is a good buy - at $15 or so, it is definitely worth it - but I would have preferred to pay a little more for better packaging and better picture quality. Not to mention the original music.",1362096000,,1542,4.178451178451178
2731022,5,B000MGBSHQ,i just love this show. can't regret this buy. The delivery was also excellent. Not the best dvd quality but this is from 20 years ago.,1356480000,,134,4.1923076923076925
2731023,5,B000MGBSHQ,I love the 90210 seasons. Ive only seen one and two. But its great to catch up on things of the past. I don't like the new 90210 at all. I couldn't get into it at all. Im trying to get all the seasons just to watch them all again.,1340150400,,230,3.62
2731024,1,B000MGBSHQ,"For true fans of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" - especially the Second Season which was one of the best - not hearing the original music is bad enough... what's so much worse is the horrible, amateur, ""home-made"" music they replaced the original music with!  Truly, it makes some of the scenes unwatchable.  For example, when David gets them all to dance at Scott's birthday party -- the song they chose to replace the original doesn't even have the same beat so the characters are all dancing off-beat.  At other times, the fake music is so awful it's distracting.  I know it doesn't seem like the music should make such a difference but it does.  You'd be far, far better off taping the show off Soapnet - it's on every day and on weekends, too.",1311984000,8,740,4.533834586466165
2731025,5,B000MGBSHQ,Of course this show is awesome the only thing that doesn't make any sense are the cut scenes and the change of the music. Otherwise it is a great buy!!,1308873600,,151,4.066666666666666
2731056,5,B000MGBSHQ,"Loved 90210 when I was younger, enjoy watching it again.  Great to pop in and listen too while cleaning and such.",1308009600,,113,4.380952380952381
2731057,5,B000MGBSHQ,"The genius of the show, especially in Season Two of Beverly Hills 90210, is how well the cast got together when looking back to the first season where everybody was disjoint from each other. I could feel it ultimately during the episode ""Walsh Family Christmas"" which will remain one of the very best of the series. It was the biggest turning point for the cast because when the cast achieved togetherness through unity, the momentum of the show finally took off and made each episode after another to be highly addicting. It's like how everything is flowing from one episode to next in a one streamed continuity. The characters are excellent as ever, and the performances by the cast are tremendous. My favorites will always be Jim and Cindy Walsh, and they are absolutely fantastic characters and make great role models and an example of how parents should be. I thought Tori Spelling's character finally came to life in Season Two and showed more depth in her character as opposed to the her seemingly uselessness in the prior season. Kudos for the makers in fixing that problem. Of course, they solved the problem of Scott because he has to be considered one of the worst actors in TV history. The way he speaks his lines while his facial features draw near to apoplexy state is hard to watch for me. To effectively end his character was a smart move for the show. Meanwhile, I had to debate the question of who is the worse character: Brandon or Brenda. It's now settled as Brenda takes the honors because she is annoying as ever. Her sense of maturity and her chain of reasoning in how she approaches her situations while creating conflicts out of nothing are breathtakingly bad. And these qualities make her a very unlikable character as it becomes more and more apparent by every drama that she needlessly causes. And then it gets worse when she ""rationalizes"" her way out of it through her anger with her parents via family discussions. As for Brandon, although he is still hypocrite as ever, he has become a more and more tolerable character as the season rolls on. To prove his hypocrisy, remember the episode ""Play It Again, David"" where Brandon played a little brother to Felix and then had him taken away from his mother and placed in a foster home. He said to Felix that he promises to see him more often in future. So...what happened? It looks like that Brandon has totally forgotten him. To further strengthen his hypocrisy, remember in the summer, Brandon deserted Nat because he wanted to take a job at the Beverly Hills Beach Club because it pays more than his job at the Peach Pit. However, later in the season, Brandon got really upset at Nat for selling out to the developers of a new mall because they bought him out with a lucrative offer. What the heck? It's the same thing. Also, if you notice, when the Asian girl took the job over for Brandon, I thought it was very odd because this Asian girl was willing to take a job for a lower pay while Brandon, who is white, takes a job that pays more. So, not trying to feel racism coming from the show here, I can't help to feel how ultra white the show has become. Every time a person of a different race appears on the show, there is always an issue that s/he brings with him. When none of them turns up in any of the episodes, Beverly Hills 90210 goes back to all-white normalcy. I am not saying the show is racist, but it just feels like a pattern. The funny part after Brandon saw his Mustang wrecked for the second time (or was it third time?) at the underground dance party, the car is immediately fixed the next day or so as I can see it sitting on the driveway. Mind explaining to me how did that happen? I must say, I love how Vanilla Ice Brandon's hair has grown to be during Season Two. Now, all Brandon just needs is a couple of razor cuts to the sides and on his eyebrows to complete the look. It's so hilarious, especially when looking at his picture in the back of the DVD cover (so funnnny). Ditto for Dylan at times, and David Silver is certainly getting there quite nicely. Towards to the end of Season Two, I thought the last two episodes were very exciting and set the tone for what's to come in the next season. However, there is a certain deja vu about the final episode because the setup of it is just too similar to ""Walsh Family Christmas."" I thought it was nice to see Surfer Betty to come back from the dead and serve a memory from Season One by appearing in one episode, and it would be even nice if the makers could do that a little bit more often with older characters (and they did that with the in-closet homosexual character of David Lascher whom I remember very well for his appearances in Blossom). I loved that episode where the band of Color Me Badd made a cameo. That was cool, and what the heck happened to them after that era? One of the best parts about Beverly Hills 90210 is the issues that are covered in many of the episodes, and they are wide in range. That made the show very watchable and interesting at the same time. I enjoy also the drama of them. Really, it is so interesting to watch how Jim and Cindy would handle the situations with their children and how they would react. That has to be one of the best parts ever. All in all, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Two brought back good memories for me, and it's the reason why everything today on television remains much, much far inferior to what was being shown during the 90's. I am highly looking forward to watching Season Three. By the way, I did like the special features, but I must say that watching Carol Potter, during an interview, to fantasize herself with Luke Perry in a reverie-like moment was really...creepy. I honestly never thought about that, but I am starting to see it a bit more now.",1283990400,,5777,4.440677966101695

2731059,4,B000MGBSHQ,Ok I have owned this for some time but because of reruns on SOapnet hadn't watched it yet.  After reading the reviews I checked out Beach Blanket Brandon ep to compare it to a poor quality copy I own that was taped from FX.  Ok so it's no HD quality but it's not that bad either.  Pic quality way better than any copy taped on VHS when it originally aired...thats a plus!  Yes music is also changed HOWEVER..after watching both I realized I would much rather have the set w/o Losing My Religion than to not have it at all!  It took forever to even get a dvd set put out and we are lucky there is one at all so I for one (though disappointed) am grateful to have this set.  As for edited scenes I noticed there was a scene in DVD box set that was NOT in the FX airings the moral here is anytime we get a rerun we get edits so FX edited and most likely SOapnet also has and yes the DVD set has....People unless you originally taped copies of the first airings we may never know each show in entirety and yes that is very sad.  I did originally tape this show or atleast most seasons but i honestly don't think the quality is going to be good this many years later LOL so...i'm happy to own this set even w/ edits and music changes.  Lets hope new shows don't make these mistakes and can be put on DVD in there entirety.,1262304000,,1317,4.057915057915058
2731060,5,B000MGBSHQ,"The second season of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" is even better than the first. This season deals with a variety of issues, including child abuse, post traumatic stress disorder, steroid use among student athletes, sexual orientation, and more. It also features some of my favorite Brenda Walsh episodes. The season kicks off with Brenda announcing that she may be carrying Dylan's child. There's also major Brenda/Dylan drama, as they break up and make up more times than I can count. Another great episode is the one where Brenda is alone at the Peach Pit during a robbery, and then of course there's the two-part season finale, which entails Brenda defying her parents to go to Mexico for the weekend with Dylan, and Jim Walsh ultimately forbidding the couple to see each other anymore.

In addition to all that, there's plenty of good stories involving the supporting cast as well. Steve embarks on a quest to find his biological mother, Kelly and David deal with their parents' budding romance, and Donna learns that her mother is having an affair. Oh yeah, and Brandon is just as much of a do-gooder as ever (he's TOO good, but you've got to love him!).

One sour note, much of the music from the original series has been replaced with crappier tunes for the DVD. That happens sometimes when a show is transferred to DVD, but it still sucks.

How could they get rid of that crucial moment when Dylan and Brenda are breaking up over REM's ""Loosing my religion"" and replace it with some song where the singer sounds like he is 12!  That song to me and many other fans is simply known as the Brenda and Dylan break-up song.  Worse yet is that they have replaced that song and MANY OTHERS with cheesy, annoying, unknown songs that don't even go with the scene!  Example, When Brandon and his ice skating girlfriend are out on the ring for their first date and the song is supposed to be from dirty dancing ""time of my life""  they do the dance moves, and he even quotes the song title at the end of the episode!

Also-and this has to be the worst part about season 2-they changed the music! And replaced it with songs that don't go with the scene it's played with. Again-in the episode with Emily,when Brenda and Dylan get back together at the end,the original song that was playing in the car was Chris Issack's ""wicked game""...watch the episode in season 2 on dvd,and it's something different! Or,in ""beach blanket brandon"",when Brenda breaks  up with Dylan,originally R.E.M.'s ""losing my religion"" was playing...on dvd-it's some no-name song. Part of what made 90210 great was the music played-it really made some scenes memorable(thank god they didn't change the slow song every one danced to in ""spring dance""!)I just think that if we're going to buy the episodes they filmed,then we should be entitled to the WHOLE episode-no deleted scenes,and more importantly,no deleted music.",1178409600,26,1386,4.944206008583691
2731131,4,B000MGBSHQ,"As a huge fan of Beverly Hills, 90210, I have been waiting for season 2 since the day after season 1 was released.  Overall this is a good season, although not as good as season 1 or season 3.  The show tried to remain true to its roots by tackling tough issues, and although this act is pulled off well, it leaves the viewer feeling like every typical high school clich is touched upon.

The biggest disappointments for me in this season were in the following areas:
- At times the transfer to DVD appears incredibly grainy and in poor quality.
- On the DVD cases for discs 6 and 7, the episode overviews are not consistent with the actual plots for each episode.  I have written them correctly in the list below.
- The soundtrack: This issue makes the show a lot worse off.  Music by Seal, R.E.M., Monie Love, Garth Brooks, Chris Isaak, Roxette, Robert Palmer, Janis Joplin, The Bangles, Color Me Badd, The Pretenders, and many other artists has all been replaced by forgetfully bland generic studio tracks.  I realize that it's not always possible for all of the original music rights to be obtained for a series, but the omission of every noteworthy song affects the overall quality and experience of the show.  The two episodes where this is most evident is in 'Chuckie's Back', when Steve pulls away from the gang on a bus, the song '2000 Miles' from The Pretenders is played, resulting in a heart-tugging ending.  The episode of 'The Next Fifty Years' starts out with 'Friends In Low Places' by Garth Brooks and hypes up to 'Work It Out' by Monie Love as the gang teaches Scott how to dance.  Those songs all appeared on the original series but were replaced on the DVD version with no-name songs that will surely leave hardcore fans frustrated.

To anyone who thinks that music isn't such a big deal, think of Tarantino movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill - without their incredible soundtracks they wouldn't have been nearly as good or memorable.  Had the original music for the show remained intact, I'd rate this season a solid 4.5 stars.  Instead, I give it a 3.5 out of 5.

The episodes are as follows:

DISC 1:
1) Beach Blanket Brandon: Brenda has a pregnancy scare which causes her to re-think her serious relationship with Dylan.  Brandon leaves the Peach Pit and gets a job at the Beverly Hills Beach Club.
2) The Party Fish: Brandon's job at the Beach Club leads him to becoming friends with a sports promoter, who wants to make Brandon his gopher boy.  Brandon cuts off the relationship when the friendship becomes to complicated.
3) Summer Storm: Dylan is injured while surfing and the Walshes invite him to stay at their home while he recovers from the accident. Jim catches Brenda and Dylan making out and wants him to leave.  Kelly falls for a new guy, but is confused by his mixed signals.
4) Anaconda: Dylan and Brandon argue after a late night poker game at the Beach Club ends with a break-in.  Dylan is the prime suspect, as it turns out he's been pawning family items to keep afloat.

DISC 2:

2731134,5,B000MGBSHQ,"Beverly Hills, 90210 was in a league of their own. It didn't seem like it then but when you think about it, 90210 was really the first show that talked frankly about teens dealing with sex, drugs, and family issues. The second season, we finally saw characters like Andrea and Kelly come into their own. Great cast all around well Tori Spelling is another story! 90210 was the first show that opened my eyes that even rich, beautiful people can be just as messed up as a middle or lower class individual. I highly recommend this groundbreaking and smart show. Enjoy!",1173916800,8,566,4.6138613861386135

While there are some great storylines in this season, I think they tried a little too hard to bring issues to the show.  First, there is the issue of death (THe Next 50 Years, David's former best friend accidentally shoots himself.  My Desperate Valentine brings up the issue of raves and underground drug use.  A Competitive Edge deals with steroids and high school athletes, etc.)  And it goes on......

The relationships between the friends continues to find new twists and turns, and that alone makes it entertaining.  And I think it is admirable that this show tried to tackle serious issues that affect many people, especially today. But, I think they tried to do it too much in one season.

A good season, yes.  Not the best one, though.",1171411200,12,1515,4.453874538745388

8168605,2,B000MGBSHQ,"Its disappointing that some business executives choose to not pay the licensing fee for the original music that played in the series. This is most noticeable in episode 8 wildfire. There isn't one original song in the episode and there are so many references to the music David chose to play, gone addicted to love, leader of the pact kungfu robot chicken and cut scene Emily singing Mercedes benz. The replacement music are awful altermative songs that don't sound like they are from the 90s and don't blend in to the episodes. Horrible choice from CBS studios who own the rights. Buyer beware this is not the 90210 that aired originally or for 10+ years in reruns.",1514505600,2,666,4.700854700854701

8168607,3,B000MGBSHQ,"The show itself is very entertaining of course. But what about this collection as a box set? It is fairly bare bones. There is not even closed captioning. No commentary tracks, no French or German, etc. The bonus features are: a program called ""Meet the Walshes"" with Carol Potter and James Eckhart talking about playing the parents on the series, another called ""Our Favorite Valentine"" about Emily Valentine, and one with some comedians I don't find funny talking about the series. It's also worth mentioning that much of the original music has been replaced, and they didn't seem to try to replace it with music that sounds at least like it is from the era. So, some of the show feels almost like you're watching a series from the 00s like Gossip Girl because there's weird pop punk music playing. Still it's worth buying if you like the show.",1505260800,,846,4.684563758389261
