8076797,4,B000AA4KKG,"This dvd has Russo and Ferarra discussing the WCW days and beyond. While the interviews were good, I would have loved to seen this get more indepth. I have questions to this day about things that went on in WCW, but these guys did give a good idea that it was as big a mess as we might think. The two men discuss their falling out with each other and their relationship today.

The real prize of this dvd is the bonus features, where we join Ferarra and Russo at an indie wrestling event where they are backstage taking to the talent. This was a real highlight of the dvd for me and very unexpected. They also includes some matches from Ferarra's forgettable career. Overall, a good dvd and it gets even better at this low price. highly recommend to old WCW fans or fans during the attitude era.",1204848000,2,795,4.3355704697986575
