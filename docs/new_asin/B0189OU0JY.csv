7542782,2,B0189OU0JY,"I showed this to a group of people without bothering to pre-screen it first because, you know--Star Wars Lego, always fantastic, right? Well, I can only hope this is a low point in the series, because the magic is not there this time. Families were walking out in less than an hour. Almost nobody stayed till the end.

It's not horrible.  There are still some laughs, and quite a lot of smiles. There are also a whole lot of forced, lame, weak jokes and rehashed jokes from previous offerings. Maybe they have new writers on the job, maybe they are finally running out of juice, or maybe the subject matter was just too ambitious this time, locking them into a framework where they had to come up with jokes to fit the ultra-familiar, often-parodied original story instead of following their own zany path. Most of the really entertaining moments appear in the trailer.

Anyway, as you probably know, this is the retelling of the original saga by C3PO, from the droids' point of view. He starts by telling the prequel series story to the victorious rebels on Endor. Then R2D2 is kidnapped by a mysterious figure, in an attempt to provide the film with an overarching weak plot, and C3PO wanders around trying to find and rescue Artoo while telling the rest of the saga to various passers-by.

I enjoyed the better moments and the few really funny lines. I liked the reappearance of one of Star Wars's lesser and forgotten Imperial villains.  Pointless shoe-horning-in of Disney's 'Star Wars Rebels' characters, complete with little fanboy to tell us how TOTALLY AWESOMELY AMAZINGLY COOL they are, just in case we haven't come to that conclusion ourselves yet, was pointless. At the same time, there was nothing but the very slightest, almost undetectable nod to The Force Awakens.  (Come on.  It's C3PO after the original trilogy. A red arm joke was BEGGING to be made. I could come up with six without even trying.)

Anyway, I won't say not to watch it. If you haven't seen the others yet, you will probably find it mildly entertaining without comparing it to the previous standard. But get it from the library or something. It isn't worth putting money into unless you insist on owning a complete Star Wars Lego collection. And then go watch Padawan Menace (and its on-disc extras), Empire Strikes Out, The Yoda Chronicles and The New Yoda Chronicles, and you will see the glory that is supposed to be Lego Star Wars.",1459555200,,2419,4.729216152019003

While my kids and I watched the movies together we really enjoyed experiencing the movies and stories in this way too. The animation was well done and there is a great mix of humor and continuity to keep this connected to the universe. This was a well crafted series that I am very happy was created!

7542789,5,B0189OU0JY,"My entire family is obsessed with Star Wars AND with Lego's. We have the Lego Star Wars video games which is how my oldest son first became interested in Star Wars. He thought the movies were based on the video game and not the other way around! We had to educate him a little and after he watched all the movies he was hooked!

There's something about the Lego characters that kids are drawn to. Even my six year old daughter and two  year old son will play the games and watch anything to do with them. My two year old brought me Lego Star Wars Droid Tales the second he saw it and asked to watch. I watched it with him the first time. I like to see what my kids are watching to make sure they are appropriate and safe. As a bonus, I happen to enjoy watching Lego Star Wars!

They are always entertaining and the thing I appreciate most about them is they are funny! Who doesn't like a good laugh? This particular DVD focuses on Droid Tales. R2-D2 has always been my favorite since I was a little girl so it was fun to watch his story. We get to see Star Wars through the eyes of the droids and learn lots of fun facts about them.

I like the authenticity of sticking by the stories from the movies and how the music and beginning are all like the Star Wars movies!

The Lego Star Wars Droid Tales is fun for the whole family to watch and my kids have had it on constant replay! It's out on DVD with five complete episodes now so run out and get a copy! Check out the cute trailers below to peak your interest!

7542816,4,B0189OU0JY,"A lot of fun, but not as funny as some of the other Lego films I've seen. Covers events more or less chronologically in the George Lucas produced (as opposed to the more recent Disney produced) star Wars films from the three prequels and then the original trilogy. (Does not include episode VII or Rogue One.) Anthony Daniels as C3PO and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissean (spelling?) are the only major original cast members but the voices by other actors, especially the actor voicing the Emperor, are very good. Runs about 115 minutes if you watch all the chapters back-to-back. This DVD edition, sadly, doesn't come with any extras or bonus material. Story is mostly told by C3PO and also prominently features R2D2. Characters and stories many fans didn't like in the film get skipped over which in and of themselves is funny: for example, Jar Jar Blinks gets jettisoned immediately upon his first appearance, the Anakin-Padme love story is skipped when C3PO's audience is disinterested in hearing it, boring exposition about the Republic's politics and trade wars, etc. Some events are retold slightly out of sequence from the original films mainly, it seemed to be, for clarity. There is new original story included when R2D2 goes off on a short adventure and C3PO chases after him. The evil Emperor is surprisingly funny especially as seen in the prequels when he switches back and forth between his two identities - and I thought he got the funniest dialogue. If you're not a Star Wars fan then most of the inside jokes will be meaningless but anyone who is a fan should find it entertaining.",1484265600,2,1604,4.836363636363636

Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales first aired on Disney XD in the summer of 2015.  With its recent DVD release, everyone can now enjoy the retelling of the Star Wars saga from C-3PO and R2-D2s perspective.  The overarching story is that R2-D2 has been kidnapped and while chasing after his captor C-3PO recalls and shares his adventures with different audience groups during some downtime.  This 115-minute DVD is broken down into five episodes and heres a quick summary of each one:

Exit from Endor  The victorious rebels are celebrating and Luke Skywalker sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Mace Windu.  At the campfire,C-3PO recalls the story of Anakins childhood and run in with Qui-Gon Jinn and Queen Amidala.  Extra comedy is added into the retelling of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones including several severe injuries of Jar-Jar Binks and Darth Mauls overuse of the word awesome.

Crisis on Coruscant  While still tracking down R2-D2s whereabouts, C-3PO shares his version of what happened in Revenge of the Sith.  General Grievous and Count Dooku kidnap the emperor in order to lure Anakin to join the dark side.  Darth Vader makes his appearance in this episode.  On a lighter note, Yodas line, Oh heck what the cracked us all up.

Mission to Mos Eisley  C-3PO heads to Tatooine to track down R2-D2.  He reminisces about A New Hope where he and R2-D2 are sold to Luke Skywalker after all of the other robots scavenged by the Jawas mysteriously break during their inspection.  Luke Skywalker begins his Jedi training with Obi-Wan and Yoda and later destroys the Death Star.  At the end of this episode, C-3PO reunites with Chewbacca and continues his quest of rescuing R2-D2 from his mysterious captor.

Flight of the Falcon  C-3PO retells the events from The Empire Strikes Back to Chewbacca and Nien Nunb as they head to the old Battle Droid Factory.  The rebels faced the wrath of Darth Vader after destroying the Death Star.  Luke trains with Yoda in Dagobah and hilarity ensues.  Han Solo got a little terse with C-3PO by telling him to shut his protocol hole.  By the end of this episode, R2-D2s captor is revealed and both robots are in danger of being recycled into battle droids.

Gambit on Geonosis  While C-3PO and R2-D2 are stalling for time, C-3PO shares the events in Return of the Jedi with the interested Stormtroopers.  Han Solo is freed from his carbonite prison and the rebels have to deal with Jabba the Hutt.  While Luke is portrayed with two different colored hands, the details are not revealed in this series.  In the end, R2-D2, General Ackbar, and the Ewoks save the day and provide a happy ending.

My kids enjoyed this series and I recommend it for any Lego and Star Wars fans out there.  While its not as funny as the other Lego Star Wars DVDs, its still worth checking out.",1461369600,2,2889,4.729458917835672

8741799,5,B0189OU0JY,Thought we were just getting episodes 1-3 and were surprised to discover that this covers all 6 episodes and the clone wars! Great way to introduce littles to Star Wars without the annoying characters (*cough Jar Jar cough cough*) or endless politics found in the clone wars. Tons of sly remarks and digs at the series to keep adults entertained and laughing (reminiscent of the old Muppets Shows!) Great to watch as a family and a fun addition to your SW collection,1517702400,,466,4.695121951219512
