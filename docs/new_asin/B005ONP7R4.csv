8481609,5,B005ONP7R4,"What a beautiful film from the Basque country this is. I was left speechless after this well developed plot, where every scene is absolutely necessary and the script is solid and meaningful. It is a drama, but a few parts are even unexpectedly funny.

Axun is a middle-aged, married woman who runs into Maite, a lesbian piano teacher, at a hospital. They had been friends when they were teenagers but had lost contact for decades until that moment. What follows after this encounter is a beautifully shot and very well acted film that will keep you breathless and guessing until the very end.

This is one of the best and most tastefully made LGBT films that I have ever watched. I highly recommend it. Keep in mind that it is spoken in Basque, so you will have to read subtitles.",1388016000,,780,4.564285714285714
