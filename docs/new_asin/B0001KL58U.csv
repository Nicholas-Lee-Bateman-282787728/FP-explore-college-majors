8013972,5,B0001KL58U,"In my opinion, Dog Days(2004) is a film that could be possibly extended to hundreds and hundreds pages of review. The reason is simply that it carries too much deep, cruel and trenchant thinking of human being ""as human being"". Unlike other hybrid quality of Ulrich Seidl's film, Dog Days seems specifically focus on the topic of marriage and relationships. Through Seidl's ultimate talent of documentary techniques, the film simply but very effectively shocks its audience and makes them ponder upon how adult relationships in reality could just be as cruel as what's successfully portrayed on the screen --- full of benefit, lust and distrust. One example throughout the plot is Maria Hofsttter's casting as a crazy girl. In the beginning, Seidl constructs the figure as childish, foolish and unsociable, yet unbelievably adorable in the same way. Then the director puts her into a series of random relationships through her cinematic engagement with random strangers willing to give her a ride. As an always sensitive motion-picture viewer to childish quality, I certainly feel that Seidl wants to capture a subtle but nostalgic charm of human being as children, which is used in Dog Days as a balance of its overall cruelty, yet also as a demonstrator of this very cruelty by documenting how this childish quality got fully abused and transformed......
In all, Ulrich Seidl is always successful because his film inherits successfully the contemporary art's spirit of cruelty and rawness. And it is simply through these brilliant cinematic portraiture and physicality of rawness that the deepest human conflicts are delivered. Excellent job.",1362787200,2,1644,5.254752851711027
8013973,4,B0001KL58U,"In ""Hunstage"" (""Dog Days"") from 2001 and by Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl, we have one of the most shocking and thought-provoking films in recent years, if not of all-time! Not since the heyday of the 70's have I seen a film so bold in its willingness to explore the human condition and defy the conventional-narrative way of telling a story. In this case, the lives of seemingly ordinary and not-so-ordinary people going about their lives in a suburb of Vienna on a hot and sweltering summer (from what I understand the film was shot over several years). Their interconnected stories were told in a semi-documentary style that added to the realism of arguably everyday real-life situations. The acting was simply first-rate, completely natural and maybe even improvised in some scenes. Mr. Seidl did not cater to commercial considerations or to the idea of Film as mindless-entertainment. Instead Ulrich Seidl has opted to choose: Film as an artistic medium, to convey a meaningful message. This film is not for everyone. There are scenes of group-sex (hardcore) and violence depicted against women. But even here, the filmmaker was being true to his core values by not shying away from reality. I think this scene was making a not so-subtle statement about the preoccupation and obsession with impersonal and unfeeling sex that has subjugated the experience of sex as pleasure of the intimate (between two persons), by so many people in the world today. The treatment of women by manipulative and dysfunctional men, was also explored to symbolize the continuing struggle of the emancipation of women in male-dominated societies (this of course, is now mostly true in less developed cultures). This film is truly remarkable, open-minded people will best appreciate it's raw and powerful discourse on the human condition. The DVD picture and sound quality by Kino Video is very good. NTSC, German (English subtitles), NR 121 mins. (BTW: The DVD is marked rated 'R' in the description field, it is actually NR. This film is the 'unrated edition' is clearly marked on the DVD. Art-House films are not-rated and I will not watch films that are!)

8013974,1,B0001KL58U,The movie was poor from the start. Just poor filming and acting. The  movie quit about 1/2 way through and I didn't even care.,1323648000,,126,4.25
8013975,3,B0001KL58U,"Winner of the Grand Special Jury Prize at the 2001 Venice Film Festival, Ulrich Seidl's weirdly engrossing DOG DAYS takes a peek under the surface of a sun-baked modern community of cookie-cutter homes.  It's an Austrian SORDID LIVES played through the artistic sensibilities of David Lynch and David Hockney.  Performed mostly by amateurs, the six intertwined stories have a documentary-like feel as lives are balanced between self-generated damnation and accidental salvation.  Cruel, compassionate, grotesque and unabashedly voyeuristic with casual nudity and explicit sex, this blurring of real and reel life is decidedly loopy, blunt yet somehow lyrical.  In Austrian with English subtitles.",1283731200,3,696,5.794117647058823
8013976,5,B0001KL58U,"Every time I view this film I find that it sets off different associations in me, causes me to think different thoughts, puts me down different avenues of rewarding contemplation. Seidl strikes me as a major talent whose greatest accomplishments may be more poetic or lyric, irrational rather than rational, whether he outwardly realizes or can admit to this yet or not.
