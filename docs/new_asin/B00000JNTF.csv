7912847,5,B00000JNTF,"Most shows that I remember fondly as a kid fall incredibly short when I watch them again.  Not so for this one!  It's incredibly cute and light-hearted, with wonderful characters and great writing.  It's well-executed and well-animated.  The only thing that could make it better would be if it were on DVD!",1118966400,,306,4.826923076923077
7912848,5,B00000JNTF,"Kids of the 80s will remember Bunjee, the kind-hearted prehistoric fuzzy purple guy who could blow his trunk up like a big balloon and fly around.  And you'll enjoy this ""Amazing Bunjee Venture.""
His pals, Karen and Andy, meet him when they travel back in their dad's clunky but surprisingly operational time machine and meet Bunjee back in the days of dinosaurs.
The voice of Bunjee is Frank Welker, who also gives voice to the Punky Brewster animated character Glomer and such familiar voices as Slimer in the Ghostbuster movies.  The movie shows us the trouble Karen and Andy's family go to in keeping Bunjee safe in the modern environment and what happens when Bunjee's main source of food (teradactyl eggs) is not available!
A real treat.  I'm glad I purchased the movie and was able to show it to my nephews, 10 and 8, who were transfixed by it last summer and asked to watch it again!  What better review than that, huh?",1039651200,2,927,4.634146341463414
7912849,4,B00000JNTF,"I was so excited to see ""The Amazing Bunjee Adventure"" finally released on video.  Children of the 80s will remember this animated movie as an episode of ""The ABC Weekend Special."" There was also a sequel called ""The Return of Bunjee,"" which is still unavailable.  The cartoon itself is very cute, and children should find it enjoyable.  It's definitely for kids only but will also bring back fond memories for those of us who saw it when we were young.",996883200,,453,4.6375
