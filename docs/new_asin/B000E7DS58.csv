8106897,1,B000E7DS58,"Howard Stern and crew rent the use of Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale NY, to host a tennis tournament featuring the freaks and misfits that call the show and provide fun at their expense. Unfunny jokes, and recycled material you've already heard on the radio shows. OK for completists and hard-core fans, but not really worth the time or the money. You can see if for free in that popular video website that people can use. It is a pity HS has not released the original TV show he had on Channel 9 in NYC as that show was very funny and worth watching.",1437004800,,549,4.339805825242719
