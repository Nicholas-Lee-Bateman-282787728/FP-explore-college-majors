The earliest way of putting out oil well fires was with water - difficult at best.  It was then accidentally discovered that one could ""blow"" them out via explosives set off at the base of the fire to temporarily deprive it of oxygen.  Long-reaching rigs were used to position the explosives, as well as drag away nearby debris in preparation.  WWII veterans then enhanced the procedure through ""shaped"" explosions.

Some experts contend that putting the fire out is the easy part - one then has to cap the well.  This may require cutting off jagged vertical pipe ends.  Initially it was done with sand-coated wire moved back and forth at the cutting location by two winches;  now it is accomplished with a hydraulic jet cutter (water with sand) - taking only 30 minutes instead of the former 30 hours.  ""Christmas tree"" caps were developed in the 1950s.

The 750-some oil platform fires in Kuwait started by the Iraq army were put out in 6 months.

""Oil Fire Fighting"" also covered the career of Red Adair (world's most famous oil fire-fighter) and a brief summary of putting out oil tank fires.",1221264000,,1348,4.713675213675214
