4018323,5,B002ZG97WO,"OK Folks - now the truth is out - JACK BLACK is really SUSAN BOYLE!  I was shattered when I saw him in that dolly drag - then the $$$ clanged?  Is it Susan Boyle or is it Jack Black?

Decide for yourself.

7 of us were the only audience in attendance - in a massive multiplex - 4 were convinced about this deception.

The movie?  Recycled fart and ""p"" gags.

Also  an unfortunate ""crack"" incident and out of nowhere an anti-war rap!

Miss Blunt shows a great [Brit.] comedic side.",1294012800,3,480,4.186813186813187
4018324,1,B002ZG97WO,"2010 marks the year that 20th Century Fox hits rock bottom. With this movie, if you can even call this a movie, Fox has become a degenerate studio catering to drooling imbeciles with any lack of taste for films in general.

Before I review this film in proper, let me list down Fox's 'achievements' for 2010:

1. John Davis. Enough said. This so-called 'uber-producer' who produces schlock for 20th Century Fox and its incumbent incompetent chairman, Tom Rothman, is no Jerry Bruckheimer or Brian Grazer. Look at his list of crapfest. Garfield? Dr Dolittle? Marmaduke? Norbit? Daddy Day Camp? And now this? He must be the king of talking animal flicks and that includes Jack Black. Can someone please stop him from producing anymore nonsensical rubbish?

2. Tom Rothman. The man responsible for micromanaging and mismanaging every single Fox misfire this year. Stipulating all films to run under 2 hours? Prince Caspian was a masterpiece at 140 minutes and Dawn Treader sunk under its light weight at 110 minutes. Same goes for X3. Whatever happened to the 131 minute of a superhero epic we got for X2? Changing the title of 'Knight and Day'? And now a marketing executive takes the blame for the film's underwhelming box office returns? Real smooth, Tom, real smooth. Way to go for being a great helmsman in charge.

3. Every flick that 20th Century Fox put out somehow fizzled at the box office. A-Team, Knight and Day, Marmaduke, Wall Street, Percy Jackson. Not a good lineup considering that the studio is celebrating its 75th anniversary. Not one classic. In comparison, look at Paramount's 1987's lineup for its 75th Anniversary. The Untouchables, Planes Trains and Automobiles, Fatal Attraction, Beverly Hills Cop 2. Now, this is the way to go!

I digress. Now back to Gulliver's Travels. The biggest problem with this flick is that everything about it is cringe-worthy. 'Gavatar'? 'Homages' to practically all successful Fox movies? This is pure shameless self-promotion and self-aggrandizement I have ever seen. If this is a contemporary update of Swift's classic novel, it has failed utterly and miserably.

Jack Black's ego is the problem here. He's still acting as a good-for-nothing slacker who plays rock music all day long. Basically, he's a momma's boy who has yet to grow up. Trying to play off his 'School of Rock' persona, I guess he wants to cater to the young. I mean, the breakout into the rock number at the end of the film, serves as an embarrassing reminder that Black needs to find an exit fast.

Emily Blunt is being reduced to nothing more than a pea-brained princess whose intelligence rivals that of Hugh Laurie's 'Prince mini-brain' in the Blackadder series. What a disappointing turn from a hugely talented actress.

Jason Segal is still holding on to a job?

All in all, a really awful cinematic experience. Extremely forgettable. This film should be analysed in film classes or even in movie executive conference rooms as to how not to make a film.",1293753600,10,2982,4.924302788844622
4018325,3,B002ZG97WO,"I could be a prude and talk about how modernizing ""Gulliver's Travels"" is an affront to Jonathan Swift's novel and to the imagination in general, or I could admit that I was amused by some of what I saw. To say that I liked this movie would be an overstatement, but it does have its redeeming qualities, and by the end, it was obvious that the film wasn't the God awful experience I had read about and had been expecting. It stars and was executive produced by Jack Black, who plays Lemuel Gulliver as a modern day mailroom clerk for a New York newspaper, a position he has held for ten years. For some time, he has had a crush on the travel editor, Darcy (Amanda Peet), although he has always lacked the nerve to ask her out; hoping to impress her, he plagiarizes sections of vacation guides and passes himself off as a travel writer.

She's impressed by his work, and lo and behold, she gives him an assignment: Sail into the middle of the Bermuda Triangle and write a piece debunking the myth that ships disappear there due to extraterrestrial activity. It's off the grid, she warns, and it will require him to be in a boat for three weeks. Gulliver assures her that it isn't a problem at all, that he's an avid boat-man. The next thing we know, he has fallen asleep at the helm, the GPS system has failed, and he's engulfed in a raging storm, one that results in an unnatural waterspout stretching high into the clouds. After being sucked into the towering vortex, Gulliver comes to on a shoreline; his body is restrained by ropes staked to the ground, and tiny people - no bigger than four inches, I'd say - are crawling all over him, thinking he's some kind of evil beast.

Gulliver is now in the kingdom of Lilliput, and judging by the period costumes and the occasion use of Arthurian language, it's a land that time forgot. Although Gulliver is initially treated as forced labor, he wins over the people by saving the life of King Theodore (Billy Connolly). How does he do this? I don't think I should say. I run the risk of (a) ruining the moment for those who may actually find it funny, or (b) disgusting the readers and forever turning them away from the film. I'll say this much: Jonathan Swift had absolutely nothing to do with it.

At this point, Gulliver has become the savior of the Lilliputians, who, as it turns out, are skilled builders. In record time, they construct a house big enough for him to live in. This is revealed in a clever shot; we see miniature construction workers toiling away on scaffolding, and as the camera pans upward, it's revealed that they're constructing a coffee maker. This home contains a theater, and it's there that Gulliver has Lilliputians reenact scenes from movies. He, of course, passes them off as events in his own life - they are amazed to learn that he fought Darth Vader, learned that Vader was his father, and, after shouting, ""I'm the king of the world!"" actually died during the sinking of the ""Titanic."" He also tells them that he's the President of the United States, that Yoda is Vice President, and that he misses the Millennium Falcon.

The emotional center of the story is Gulliver's friendship with a Lilliputian named Horatio (Jason Siegel), and although he's a lowly commoner, I was surprised at just how much I liked him. He has feelings for the lovely Princess Mary (Emily Blunt), but she can't reciprocate, for she's betrothed to General Edward (Chris O'Dowd), who, for the sake of the kingdom, must maintain his reputation and his honor. Edward is an arrogant, jealous fool who wants to possess Mary and hates Gulliver for no reason other than the fact that he exists. Although he's the primary antagonist, he's also the film's main source of comedy; we delight as we watch him fail miserably at courting Mary and protesting Gulliver's influence on the people of Lilliput. The latter includes T-shirts, shorts, and a complete transformation of the town center into a Times Square recreation, the neon Broadway posters altered to prominently feature Gulliver's face. Somehow, I just don't see him as Elphaba or the Phantom of the Opera.

I neglected to mention that ""Gulliver's Travels"" is in 3D, but considering how inundated we are with movies in that format, it probably wouldn't have made a difference. Although it's being advertised as a family comedy, it was really made for younger audiences in the transition phase from mindlessly innocent to awkward and rebellious. It may not please fans of Jack Black's raunchier comedies, although it does have a few well placed immature scenes. When the Lilliputians toss hooked ropes up to Gulliver's pants and expose part of his crack, for example, he loses his balance and falls backwards; all of the soldiers retreat except for one, and he ends up being wedged in an unspeakably dark and frightening place. Yeah, I laughed. Part of me wishes I hadn't, though. I also wish I didn't have to pay extra for the 3D glasses. There I go, being a prude.",1293494400,4,4972,4.658314350797267

4018452,1,B002ZG97WO,"Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, originally published
in 1726, has been one of the most renowned classics of
English literature.  Perhaps better that Mr. Swift not be
alive today to see this ungodly interpretation of his work
bastardized by the likes of Jack Black, an actor that
Hollywood still has not apparently realized nobody thinks
is talented nor funny.

Sorry to be so blunt, but sitting through this tripe only
makes you feel embarrassed for the actors that signed
on to participate.  While I am certain the film was an
easy payday for a cast that only had to go through
the most wooden of emotions in front of blue screen, I am
sure none of them are too happy about including this film
on their resume.

The film is ever so loosely based on the original literary
works, deprived of its original political and religious satire,
and reduced to a mere children's story filled with pre-puberic
humor.  It is exactly the kind of film you would expect Jack
Black to be starring in.  For when you want to make a film
that caters to the lowest common denominator, what better
than to hire someone to play the lead whose only talent is
carry an entire movie with his patented assortment of facial
features that got old after The School of Rock.

In this adaptation, Lemuel Gulliver (Jack Black) is a mailroom
clerk in a large newspaper facility.  He has a crush on one of
the newspaper's travel editors, Darcy Silverman (Amanda
Peet), and attempts to impress her by volunteering to go on
assignment to write a column.  Darcy sends Lemuel into the
Bermuda Triangle where a turbulent sea storm shipwrecks
his boat on an island where he becomes imprisoned by tiny
inhabitants known as Lilliputs.

Oh, the writers must have dreamed of putting Jack Black into
this playground where he can strut his stuff amongst tiny city
models and stiff actors who point and gawk at every move
the giant makes.  Here is a land Jack Black makes his own,
infusing every pop icon reference (including several Fox
properties) he can to make it hip and funny -- but unfortunately
the movie turns out to be anything but.

In an effort to make this garbage even more appealing to
audiences, the moviemakers decided to present it in 3D.
That would be well and good if there was a reason to make
audiences shell out a few dollars more to enjoy the spectacle.
Unfortunately, a great opportunity was totally shelved here.
For the life of me, I couldn't understand why the filmmakers
didn't allow ""Mr. Eyebrows"" and his supporting cast to make
better use of the props they were given for the benefit of the
format.  It was after watching the film that I learned that the
entire film was shot for 2D and then upconverted for 3D.

That makes complete sense, for I will be honest with you,
Gulliver's Travels does not benefit by the 3D process
whatosever.  Sure, the mere scope of the film, placing
big objects within small environments, offers an interesting
amount of dimensional spacing, but overall the film often
looks flat to the point you forget you are watching a 3D feature.
I feel somewhat ashamed, as the HTF 3D GURU that I
don't have more to tell you about the quality of the 3D --
but there just isn't anything I was inspired by.  When you
have a feature originally staged and filmed for 2D, one
can't expect the film to break any new ground here.  In
fact, nothing onscreen comes close to leaping off the
screen.

Ghosting is barely present here.  I didn't notice it at all
through much of the film up until a scene towards the
end that takes place in a darkened cave between
Gulliver and Darcy where I saw quite a bit of image
doubling.

The Blu-ray transfer sports a very crisp, pleasing image
that is colorfully vibrant.  One need only to check out the
lush greens of the Liliput country landscape to see how
well colors are represented in this high-def transfer. There
is no artifacts to be found anywhere.

A 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is rather ample, though
never pushes the boundaries of being exceptional. To clarify,
the audio is clear and strong and the surrounds provide good
support for the film's effects, but this is far from being the
best DTS track I have heard despite there being some nice
underlying bass response during the climatic effect sequences.

The Blu-ray 3D combo back also includes a DVD and Digital
Copy as ell as 60 minutes of all-new bonus material.

Gulliver's Travels should be a total embarrassment for
everyone involved with it.  The film best appeals to kids
who might get a kick out of some of the film's more
vulgar humor.  Adults will be completely straight-faced
throughout.

Even with a price difference of $5, there is no benefit
to upgrading to the 3D version.  Stick with the standard
Blu-ray instead.",1453075200,,4736,4.646282973621103

I relented and have to say that I actually really enjoyed it very much. Clearly the story has been updated and Gulliver is basically a slacker mailroom boy who dreams of impressing his boss, an editor in a New York travel magazine. He ends up taking a boat through the Bermuda Triangle and ends up in Lilliput, a kind of Ruritanian country, where he makes some kind of success mainly by urinating on the castle when it is on fire and saving the king of Lilliput.

There are some brilliant comic performances by Jack Black and Chris O'Dowd as well as Emily Blunt. You also have Billy Connolly and Catherine Tate (a bit underused) as the king and queen of Lilliput.

It has a nice cast, headed by Jack Black, who can carry a movie with humor and charm under certain circumstances. It is sumptuously photographed with wonderful special effects and rich colors.

It also has a miserably cliched story further dragged down by obviously intentionally wooden acting. For some reason the ""creative forces"" behind the movie thought that the wooden acting was some sort of comedic tour de force. The truth is that it is just wooden acting.

Jack Black is charming and funny when he's not TRYING to be charming and funny. Here he is trying very hard to be charming and funny, with predictably miserable results.

There are a few bits here and there which could have been really funny. Intellectually I could see the potential humor. However, they are completely mismanaged and dry as presented in this film. It is all a very sad waste.",1339113600,,894,4.748387096774193

I appreciate Jack Black's humor, and I think that in the right role he can be quite entertaining, but lately he has really misfired on his comedies (Year One comes to mind). Gulliver's Travels is the latest bomb, so atrociously bad because it fails in so many ways:

1)It isn't as family friendly as it proposes. The film tries to get a wider audience by making this PG, but it the humor is lewd and not really suitable for younger kids.
2)It diminishes and dumbs down the novel to the equivalent of an episode of Beavis and Butthead. They try to take the novel and try to make it funny, but really it comes across as artificial and dumb (i.e. trying to woo the princess by singing Prince's song ""Kiss"")
3)The dialogue is flat, stilted, clichd with prototyped, lame characters. Nothing original at all. The effort in the film comes across as lazy.
4)It isn't remotely funny and the attempts to get a few chuckles are through juvenile humor. (Jack Black urinating on the town, seeing his butt, singing a rendition of ""War"", etc).

4018920,3,B002ZG97WO,"***This review may contain spoilers***

First of all, in response to Swiftian purists who were disappointed that Jack Black's version of ""Gulliver's Travels"" (hereafter GT) was not strictly faithful to Swift's ageless satire, I say, are you hopelessly naive?  In spite of its fantastic locales and characters, GT really doesn't lend itself to cinematic treatment because of its episodic structure and laceratingly pessimistic satire of human nature.  As Hallmark proved, GT is more suited to a mini-series approach, and while, I believe, Hallmark's GT (starring Ted Danson as Lemuel Gulliver) is the best (and probably the only) faithful adaptation of Swift's satire we will ever witness, even it had a contrived upbeat ending antithetical to Swift's themes.  As movies go, I think a somewhat whimsical (albeit somewhat superficial) fairy-tale approach is the best way to deal with GT.  Just about every GT movie version (animated or live action) does so, and I have enjoyed them all.  That goes for Jack Black's ""GT"" too, which is about on a par with the others.

(PLOT DESCRIPTION:  Lemuel Gulliver (Jack Black), a boisterous, but surprisingly shy, mail-room clerk for a New York travel company, can't seem to advance professionally or romantically.  He has harbored a 5-year crush on Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) without acting on it.  Gathering his courage one more time to ask Darcy out, he loses his nerve and instead pretends to be a noted travel writer looking for a better job.  After Gulliver fabricates a plagiarized travel article on Mexico, Darcy gives him a Bermuda Triangle assignment. Gulliver goes to Burmuda, charters a sailboat, gets sucked into a watery maelstrom, and finds himself bound on the ground in Lilliput, a miniature kingdom of doll-sized people.  At first their chained slave, Lemuel gains freedom and respect after saving the tiny princess (Emily Blunt) from a palace fire with his - excretions and the whole kingdom from an armada sent by Lilliput's enemy, the equally tiny kingdom of Blefescu. Lilliput celebrates the ""giant"" Gulliver as a hero and protector, all except the treacherous and jealous Lilliputian general Edward Eduardo (Chris O'Dowd), who schemes to take over Lilliput (and treasonously orchestrated the fire and armada attack) and resents the intrusion of the ""big, hairy beast"".

 Feeling like a ""big shot"" for the first time in his life, Gulliver gets the royal treatment from the industrious and tech-savvy Lilliputians, who amazingly build him a seaside home, theater, and even miniature Times Square mockup, and cater to his every need.  In the meantime, Gulliver regales the tiny folk with tall tales of his exploits, cribbing from ""Star Wars"", ""Titanic"", and other movies.  But the facade quickly crumbles as Gulliver receives voicemail messages from Darcy, who has realized Gulliver's deception and threatens to fire him.  Even worse, General Eduardo constructs a 7-foot metal robot (from a blueprint Lemuel accidentally brings with him) that humiliates, defeats, and exiles Gulliver to ""the forbidden land"", which turns out to be Brobdingnag, land of the giants (not named in the film).  For a while, the demoralized Gulliver becomes the plaything of a sadistic little girl until the heroic Lilliputian Horatio (Jason Segel), Gulliver's best friend in Lilliput, finds him and convinces him to come back to save the kingdom.  In the meantime, Darcy, who has set out to perform Gulliver's assignment, is also caught in the whirlpool and whisked to Lilliput, where she is also made prisoner.  Gulliver finds her in the dungeon he used to occupy, along with the king (Billy Connolly), queen (Catherine Tate), and the rest of the royal retinue, frees them, and vows to save Lilliput from the usurper Eduardo and his Iron-Man like robot. With Horatio's help, Gulliver does defeat Eduardo and the robot and save the kingdom, and wins Darcy's love and a real job as travel writer.  Also, Horatio finally overcomes his ""base"" origins and wins the princess's love.  Gulliver and Darcy go back to New York. Whew!)

Now I'll admit that ""GT"" is far from a seamlessly perfect movie.  It contains improbabilities and plot holes a Brobdingnagian could walk through (e.g. how did the medieval Lilliputians acquire enough resources and technological know-how to feed and house Gulliver?; why didn't Gulliver trample any Lilliputians with all his jumping around; why didn't the Blefuscudian cannons wound Gulliver like a pistol?, how did Horatio make it safely to Brobdingnag to save Gulliver?; how could Gulliver's phone have enough bars to receive Darcy's call?).  The special effects and CGI were also wildly variable, from stunning to background projection phony.  And no, ""GT"" does not address Swift's satirical themes at all.  In spite of these shortcomings, I did enjoy the movie.

I guess Jack Black's Gulliver insidiously won me over.  Sure, he's a chubby, fun-loving, energetic goof, but he is also (and not inconsistently) an endearingly diffident, uncertain guy with self-esteem issues.  Even in Lilliput, he is initially intimidated by the tiny kingdom and general until he proves his worth.  Even when he is exploiting and deceiving the Lilliputians (who reminded me of the Doozers in ""Fraggle Rock""), Gulliver is sweet and gentle to all of them.  He acts as a huge, funny Cyrano de Bergerac to Horatio by giving him song lyrics from Prince help him woo the princess.  Gulliver doesn't want to hurt anyone; even when he faces the Blefuscudian armada, he tries unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the ship commanders and says he'll only pretend to attack them if they promise to leave.  When Gulliver's fortunes fall because of his deceit and he sinks into despair, I think it's touching. When he regains his confidence and vows to be a genuine hero, to both Darcy and Lilliput, I think it's both touching and inspiring.  Gulliver's tussle with the robot was also fun and even a bit hair-raising, as when the robot knocks Gulliver back and he (or maybe a stunt double) performs a temporary headstand (with no arm support).  I guess I am part of the group that like's Jack Black's frat-boyish, exuberant, but basically decent persona (as I did in ""School of Rock"" and ""King Kong""). ""GT"" showcases believable character growth and development.

Ultimately, ""GT"" is what it is: an engagingly silly but enjoyably lighthearted romp with gently-presented themes of integrity, courage, and self-improvement.  And yes, I really mean that (even taking the butt-crack and urination scenes into account).",1322006400,5,6545,5.1570482497634815

4018993,2,B002ZG97WO,"I am sorry to start by saying that `Gulliver's Travels' was quite a disappointing film.

This follows Gulliver, played by Jack Black, after he gets lost at sea and wakes up in the land of Lilliput surrounded by people a fraction of his size.  He uses his size and strength to assist them and becomes an integral part of their lives.

The premise is sound enough, but the execution is sadly lacking.  Jack Black plays the role as he has numerous roles before and you can see he isn't stretched or tested in any way.  You can only watch so many film where he gurns and plays air guitar before it wears a bit thin.  The rest of the cast, which includes some great British names, are all rather wooden and the dialogue is atrocious.

Thankfully the effects are reasonable and this also has a decent soundtrack which helps redeem it.

I guess this film is aimed more towards a child audience and they may well enjoy it more than my wife and I did.  We were glad it was just under 90 minutes and whilst it isn't the worst film I've ever seen, it isn't a good film either. You can quite happily watch it and not be overly offended, but I'm guessing this isn't a film that warrants repeat viewings.

However, I was intrigued because it was based on a classic novel.  And I don't mind silly movies if that's what I'm expecting.  I didn't think I would give it 5 stars though and the reason is this:  I laughed SO hard at the doll house scene that my emotions took over and I wanted to cry.  That good-for-you unexpected laughter that perks you up for days.  I would find myself thinking about that whole scene and just crack up again... at bedtime or doing housework.

Now take scenes from each of them and transpose them onto the plot of the first half of the book Gulliver's Travels, and you have this farce of a comedy.  The original book, and the Hallmark movie by Ted Danson, is an exploration of different political systems and what they do to the people living inside them.  This movie by Jack Black drops all of that and is basically a comedy outing.  The comedy is good, for those who have never seen any of Black's previous movies.  If you have, then a lot of it is a rip-off.  For example, the various rock and roll scenes with the Lilliputians is just a rehash of School of Rock.  And Amanda Peet again shows why she is a good supporting actress, and not much else.  Her acting does little to help the movie.

Jack Black, mail room boy, has a crush on the travel editor at the newspaper where he is employed. He ends up writing a story for her which lands him trip to the Bermuda Triangle. This in turn sends him to Lilliput where he ends up helping a lowly commoner in love with the princess. Not too difficult to figure out the symbolism. Jack has the Lilliputians construct items similar to our own. While there is humor in this, as well humor in Jack's fascination with Star Wars and Guitar Hero. However, the movie lacks the biting political satire of the original tale, something they could of done if they had a half decent script writer.

4019093,1,B002ZG97WO,"Jack Black is one of those actors/musicians that you either like somewhat or hate with a passion. There really is no middle ground. For me, Jack Black the actor will best be known for Be Kind Rewind, the Kung Fu Panda films, Saving Silverman, and High Fidelity while Jack Black the musician kind of lost his mojo after the first Tenacious D record (which is still a favorite amongst friends). Truth be told, Black seems to be at his best when he's not confined to the limits of family entertainment or at least has some room to stretch in a PG-13 environment. Gulliver's Travels actually feels like a Jack Black movie despite its family friendly rating, but that still can't save the fact that it's a fairly horrid experience overall.

Gulliver (Black) works in the mail room and comes to the realization that he's not going anywhere in life. He finds himself on the way to The Bermuda Triangle after informing the office travel editor, Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet), that he's this supremely gifted (plagiarized) writer. On his journey there, Gulliver wakes up on the island of Liliput which is filled with nothing but tiny people. As a giant amongst mere men, Gulliver sees this as a chance to start over and be the ""big man"" for once. He soon learns that the size of a person isn't always an accurate portrayal of how big they really are.

For a movie being marketed towards children, it was kind of shocking what actually made it into the film. There's an entire conversation centered on the term, ""lame ass,"" which is blurted several times throughout the entire two minute conversation. Can you remember the last time Mickey Mouse called Donald Duck a ""dumb ass?"" I sure can't (that ""South Park"" episode doesn't count). After a fire breaks out in Liliput, Gulliver thinks on his feet er...with his groin and puts out the fire by urinating on it as well as a handful of tiny people in the process. When all else fails, when you have a problem you're having a difficult time resolving, just piss on it as well as everyone around you. That's pretty much what you'll take away from the segment. And did they really squeeze the phrase, ""skeet skeet,"" into a family movie? Really?! That's pretty insane. What's even more ludicrous is what the film followed that part of the conversation up with; ""ship happens."" It sure does, Gulliver. It sure does.

You can probably accept the way the movie begins; mostly because it actually looks and feels like the way Jack Black wakes up every morning. Walking around without pants on, re-enacting Star Wars with action figures, and mixing coffee and creamer in the filter to make coffee all seem like something the Jack Black people have gone to see on-screen the past fifteen years would do. That's kind of the only good thing about Gulliver's Travels. It does feel like it's Jack Black approved and authenticated by the man himself, which it probably was since he also produced it. The movie is based on the Jonathan Swift novel of the same name, which was written in 1726. But the movie gives no on-screen credit to the novel and that should be the first sign that you should probably abandon ship before you even board.

The bottom line is Gulliver's Travels isn't funny. Not even a little bit. It's just toilet humor and expensive special effects colliding together while Jack Black shoves his goofy antics down your throat. The guy passes out after he falls on his backside, which is honestly something I've never seen before this movie. While Black does look to be having fun in the role, it just doesn't translate very well. These tiny people build Gulliver a life size home in less than seven days, which doesn't seem very logical. Forcing Horatio (Jason Segel) to recite Prince's ""Kiss"" while trying to woo Princess Mary (Emily Blunt) probably should've been more entertaining than it was. Jack Black can sing. He has the talent and the ability, but he's one of those performers that's better heard rather than seen. Him singing ""War"" at the end of the movie really should've just played over the credits rather than be an in-movie, choreographed with tiny people music video. Was Emily Blunt being awful on purpose? She was just horrendous at times. Plus she dropped out of Iron Man 2 for this? Somebody explain that to me.

Gulliver's Travels is more than likely just as bad as the unfortunate soul that actually sat through it told you it was, if not worse. Jack Black does try to carry the film the best that he can, but it all crumbles once he literally and figuratively urinates all over everything. Throw in a giant robot and Black's butt crack and it's immediately labeled as something you should probably never sit through. Ever. Although featuring some well done special effects, any little bit of good Gulliver's Travels once had is massively outweighed by bad acting, weak story points, and humor that's more disgusting than it needs to be.",1309046400,7,4901,4.720794392523365

4019175,3,B002ZG97WO,"This screen play adaptation of Johnathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels was written by Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller and stars comedy legend Jack Black.  Black plays Lemuel Gulliver, a loser from the mail room with a debilitating crush on travel editor Darcy Silverman played by Amanda Peet.  When the new hire gets promoted to his boss in one day Black decides it's time to take a chance and ask Peet out, only when he gets there he loses his nerve and instead lies about wanting to be a travel writer applying to write for her section.  He plagiarizes his  writing samples and is sent off on an assignment to the Bermuda triangle before Peet figures it out.  Unfortunately while there his boat crashes and he winds up on an island of action figure size people with strange customs who go from treating him as a prisoner to making him their hero.  Not wanting the hero worship to end Black's character makes up a series of giant lies to make himself appear cooler to the residents of Liliput.  The lies backfire when Black's character is challenged by a robot larger than himself and Black is then forced to figure out if he will remain the man he is or become the man he wants to be.

The movie was alright.  I wouldn't call it great, but I wouldn't call it particularly bad either.  Most of the characters were incredibly silly and you couldn't help but get a laugh from them.  The worst part of this movie is that it likes to rely a lot on dumb comedy moves rather than intelligent comedy, for example Gulliver puts out a raging fire in the castle by urinating on it.  Also if you're the type of person, like I am, who gets embarrassed for the character in the movie you'll spend a lot of time covering your head wanting to die of embarrassment as this character continuously does stupid and embarrassing things.  There are quite a few humorous musical scenes and two adorable love stories within the movie that make it bearable to watch.  If you can make it through all the embarrassing moments and dumb comedy the ending is quite gratifying as well.

Luckily I only rented the movie and did not buy it. Anyone who does purchase it is going to feel like a chump each time they are forced to sit through the same trailers and commercials in order to watch the movie they paid for. This is a waste of 8 to 10 minutes.",1305849600,6,830,4.1875

4019294,1,B002ZG97WO,"There are comedians who make some hilarious movies. The problem is that they have a certain shtick that they use...and then use again...and then use again and again and again until they've played it out so often that they fade to obscurity. That or they begin to make movies that folks never pay to see any more (see Eddie Murphy). Face it, when you rely on the same character or style over and over again people will tire of you quickly. Such is the case with Jack Black and especially his new DVD release GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.

Black stars as Gulliver, the head of the mailroom for a magazine. As he introduces the new guy to the job, we get to see him ignored by most of the staff and his longing for the travel editor Darcy (Amanda Peet). By the end of the day this new employee has taken his job and let him know that he'll always been in the position he's in because he has no backbone, no ambition to move forward. He also notes the same holds true with his affection for Darcy, a love that will go unrequited because he never makes a move towards her.

This changes when he stops by her office that night intending to let her know how he feels. But he backs down and tells her that he's actually there to sign up as a writer for her department. She's glad and gives him an assignment except that he's never been anywhere and has no idea what to write. A few moment of copy and paste and suddenly he's got a new job. And a new assignment, heading to the Bermuda Triangle to look into the truth behind it.

With no idea what he's doing he soon finds himself heading for a swirling mass of water going up rather than down. His boat is swept up and the next thing he knows he's been washed ashore of an island inhabited by people who stand about 4 inches tall, the Lilliputians. Captured by egomaniacal officer General Edward (Chris O'Dowd) and their army, he's forced into a life of servitude making friends with another prisoner named Horatio (Jason Segel). Horatio's crime is falling in love with Princess Mary (Emily Blunt) who is betrothed to General Edward.

A chance rescue of the Princess wins Gulliver freedom and the same for his new friend. He becomes the protector of the country. All the while Edward attempts to knock down this new hero and take back his place atop the crowd. When that fails, he sets out to take over the kingdom or at least assist in it.

Can Gulliver save the day? Can he take on Edward? Will Horatio and Princess Mary finally get together? Will Gulliver ever have the chance to woo Darcy? WHO CARES!

This movie is perhaps one of the worst that I've ever seen and that's saying something. I like almost every movie I watch in one way or another. But this film is terrible from start to finish. And the biggest reason is the center of it all, Jack Black. This is not a portrayal of Gulliver but the same goofy oddball that he's played in almost every movie he's made. This character always tries to act cool, to act like he's in the know, to create words of his own making to display how with it he is. The problem is that while it may have been funny the first time it has now become downright intolerable. Okay we get it Jack, you're the goofball who pretends to be hip but who isn't. Ha ha.

The jokes are some of the lamest ever written. That is if they were intended to be jokes. Who knows, there was never one moment that I found myself smiling let alone laughing. The acting is on par with junior high plays...I take that back. That would be an insult to junior high school actors. But perhaps its less their problem seeing as how most of these actors are quite good and thus the fault of the director.

Another thing that insults the audience is the special effects. In a time when we can make spaceships seem real, when we can make hobbits and orcs look like they could actually exists, the special effects displayed here seem lame. One would think they would outshine those seen in the 1960 film THE 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER but they don't. I'm not even certain that children would be impressed with these effects.

But the main thing remains Jack Black. I like him. I loved his earlier films. He just needs to move forward. The same thing has happened with comedic actors in the past. As I said, Eddie Murphy went from making some of the best comedies around to making lame movies where he does the same thing over and over again. Robin Williams was another comedic actor who headed that direction until he finally realized that doing the same character with a different name won't get people to watch your movie.

Black did a great job in KING KONG. I'd love to see him in another movie that pushed him to act rather than skate through a lame film. If he doesn't his days are numbered. His acting here seems like an appearance on David Letterman. When that happens I change the channel. And as for this film to even pay a $1 rental would be paying too much.  I'm wondering if even renting this for free from the library would be worth it. Avoid this at all cost.",1304467200,9,5006,4.349036402569594

4019297,1,B002ZG97WO,"For sometime now stand-up comedians have been picked to play main characters in many comedy movies. The trend may be motivated because the producers save some money rather than hiring real actors. Unfortunately the results more often than not, are poorly acted movies, repulsive rather than funny situations, and feeling that strong desire to leave the theater, (or just turn off the TV if you watch at home) in just the first 10 minutes after the movie started. This movie is just one of those, with the difference that instead of 10 minutes you only need 5 to reach that point.

Jack Black may be funny (to some people) as stand-up comedian, but as a movie actor he is really really really bad.

In this movie he uses his body to try to make people laugh, but I could tell that most people watching, did not. With so many better actors available in Hollywood, maybe this movie could have been saved from doom, had the casting crew have done a better job by selecting a real actor for the main character.

He's landed in the land of the Lilliputians, who may be little but can build anything and apparently, have full access to modern technological devices.  At first, they hold him hostage, later he wins their undying gratitude by doing something that will be absolutely hysterical to anyone under the age of 10.

There are elements of Cyrano De Bergerac,  ""School of Rock,"" ""Be Kind, Rewind,"" and even an episode of ""Malcolm in the Middle.""  It's like someone gave the director and cast free rein to do whatever they wanted, and unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any consensus as to what kind of movie this should be (comedy/rom-com/musical), apart from silly.

4019553,4,B002ZG97WO,"This latest movie on Gulliver's Travels, which is based on a novel written by Jonathan Swift, an Irish writer and clergyman in the early 1700s, has a new twist to it and is set in more contemporary times.

While the original book had several aspects to it, as listed below:

[1] Adventure at rival countries of Lilliput and Blefuscu.
[2] Adventure at Brobdingnag.
[3] The Flying Island - Laputa
[4] Empress Muodi's Estate
[5] Glubbdubdrib - the magician's dwelling
[6] Struldburgs - immortals with blindness
[7] Houyhnhnms / Yahoos

This film only touches on the first, and a bit of the second adventure aspects of the novel.

However, it is still a delightful PG-rated movie. Rather than just being a storm that causes Gulliver's adventures, the Bermuda Triangle is brought into the mix, which is pretty cool.

Also this film has some charming romantic aspects to it, firstly between Gulliver (Jack Black) and his co-worker Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) and secondly on a smaller scale, between Horatio (Jason Segel) and Princess Mary (Emily Blunt).

A lot has been thrown into the pot in making this movie, and these elements make the movie unusual and enjoyable. For the main battle, the army of Blefuscu, with the help of General Edward (Chris O'Dowd) of Lilliput, constructs a massive robot, that has some 'transformer' type capabilities to fight Gulliver. This was quite imaginative of the writers. Also throughout the movie, Guilliver 'pirates' ideas from other movies, and this also lends itself to some humor.",1297123200,6,1518,5.027888446215139

I highly recommend GULLIVER'S TRAVELS!!!",1294790400,3,626,4.405172413793103
4019557,4,B002ZG97WO,"I love Jack Black and especially in his Tenacious D years (see link below: but beware), but some may say this is immature, he is also a great talent. I think his role was perfect here and I do think he would be happy with such a ""unique"" production. The twist is unique and children were laughing a lot in the theatre so it is entertaining.

I think the direction could have been better. I think the story was lacking. The Mail Room replacement could have been meaner; there could have been a better story here. The big lesson(s) was/were missing.

If you are 8 years old, or have 8 year olds they may well love this. I think it would be a great way to spend the afternoon with a bucket of popcorn and Pepsi in hand.  It is by no means painful to watch. The adults I watched it with were slightly disappointed, but CRITICAL to remember that this is not aimed at adults. Admittedly there were very funny parts that even the tightest of grinches would have to laugh at.

If you are a Jack Black fan it's a most see.

I rate this 5 for the children in the audience and a 2/3 from myself and the other adults. A true feeling would be a 3.5. Be fair, if you honestly like movies that are a little immature (in the most positive of ways) you will be up there with the 5 perhaps.

4019558,3,B002ZG97WO,"If you hate Jack Black you will not want to see this film. If you love him, you will probably love Gulliver.

For everyone else:  Moments of cleverness, special effects and sweet humor make it watchable. I didn't see it in 3D which I'm sure added an element that would make it more watch-worthy. Overall, it is a sweetish story of growing up, doing the right thing, taking responsibility for your actions, and overcoming slackerness.

Basic plot: Gulliver is the manager of the mail room at a large newspaper. He has a huge, silent crush on the travel writing editor. He packs up all his boyish pride and charm and intends to ask her out, but he flakes and pretends to want to write a travel article. She gives him a fake one to test his skills and he plagiarizes some impressive write-ups. She offers him an obscure gig in the Bermuda Triangle.  And there the story gets freaky. He's sucked into a whirlpool and wakes up on a beach and discovers that he's infested with little people --- angry little people. He goes on to befriend them by saving the king but makes an enemy out of the head of the military, the king's soon-to-be son-in-law. Drama, angst, and more drama follow, lessons are learned and everyone who deserves to lives happily ever after does.

High points: The Lilliputians are extreme builders and there are very entertaining moments watching them in action. Live theater wherein the Lilliputians act out scenes from Gulliver's ""life"" are entertaining  too. ""Live"" interactive video games ala Rock Band or Guitar Hero are funny. One scene was an inappropriately laugh out loud moment for me. During the arrest scene on the beach, Gulliver's shorts get yanked on exposing some crack, and then he falls, onto one of the most unfortunate Lilliputians. The credits may have been a bigger laugh though because he was billed as the butt crack guy. My friends and I thought that would be a fabulous addition to his resume and/or a great ice breaker at parties. ""So have I seen you in anything?"" ""Well, my best part was Butt Crack Guy in Gulliver's Travels.""

Low points: Lots of bathroom humor. From saving the king by putting out the fire via bladder contents, to the scene where the words Lame A--are used about ten times while Gulliver tries to convince the General that Lame A--is the ultimate in compliments, to the whispered say-what-I-say-to-your-lady-love scene, to the anti-war dance, there are plenty of flat or odd moments. Gulliver's relationship with Darcy (Amanda Peet) is not real fleshed out or believable, and Emily Blunt really doesn't get much of a chance to shine.

It's worth the investment of a Red Box or Netflix rental. Unless you hate Jack. If you do, don't even put it on your queue.",1294185600,11,2720,4.723628691983122

The movie is entertaining but I did not think the ending fit the movie...Jack Black is an amazing musician and the ending was just showing off his talents and had nothing to do with the movie.

8384830,4,B002ZG97WO,"A fairly decent update on Swift's farcical commentary on 18th century European and British politics, this one is updated for an early 21st century audience.  Underachiever who's got the hots for one of the office hotties turns plagiarist with adventurous results.  Like the few other adaptations of Swift's classic tale, only the ""giant"" section of the story is used for the film.

I personally like it as a simple comedy adventure, which is pretty much all it is.  There might be one or two objectionable moments that are actually from Switf's original narrative, and the overall theme much aligns itself with Swift's personal philosophy and take on the world.

Jack Black gives another great humorous performance, and the supporting cast does the same to give a tale about the meeting of two cultures that borrow from one another and ultimately clash with adventure and romantic results.

Check it out.",1505692800,,904,5.033557046979865
