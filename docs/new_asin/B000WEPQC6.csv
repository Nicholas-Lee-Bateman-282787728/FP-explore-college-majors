8223026,2,B000WEPQC6,"You don't ""see"" James Brown very often here on this rare DVD. The first TV clip is from circa 1977 and shows James Brown performing ""Payback"" live with his group. Then, you get about one hour of trailers and various obscure film excerpts of diverse movies from the 1970s featuring either a James Brown soundtrack, some James Brown musical background, or just shots of James Brown performing. In total, you get about one and a half song where you can actually ""see"" James Brown, no more than 10 minutes in this whole DVD. BUT, if you are a fan and want to discover everything, and even the lesser-known universe of James Brown in movies, these rare and violent films will seem uncovered. Technical quality ranges from fair to mediocre. Not for the fan who want to see James Brown performing live on stage. Many other James Brown DVDs would propose complete concerts.",1406678400,,865,4.697368421052632
