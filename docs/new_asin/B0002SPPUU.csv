2117855,4,B0002SPPUU,"This U.S. Border Patrol agent, Adam Fields (John Carlos Frey) is angry with his job for keeping him behind.  He is angry with his wife and doesn't want intimacy with her everytime she wants it and his past bothers him too.  He has no father because his mother, now gravely sick, doesn't know which ""john"" out of many it could have been.  He refuses the blood money inheritance.  So he ""moonlights"" to catch border smugglers.  Clearly he deserves a promotion by now.  He poses as a Mexican who wants to illegally get into America.  He goes to the pottery gift shop where in the back room is a different operation.  A secretary is there.  They want 30,000 pesos to transport him and he will have to work one full year with them to pay the rest.  Along with the other mexicans, he is forced to carry a gallon of clear substance.  They are not to open it or drink it.  It is a chemical or acid used for drugs.  It will burn through your skin.  If you do not have the jug after the walk, they will not give you a ride in.  Now Adam knows for sure this is the illegal smuggling group.  He makes it through, but some are shot to death.  Now he is a migrant worker and his plan is about to backfire.  There are no phones where he is at.  No way to call his work.  He is getting deeper and deeper with no way out.

  Hollywood does it again.  Not one shot was filmed inside Mexico, but shot entirly in San Diego, California.

  DVD includes optional Spanish subtitles.",1107388800,6,1459,4.2299270072992705
2117856,4,B0002SPPUU,"This film is about a biracial man from a single parent home.  He is racist and xenophobic.  His bigoted peers convince him to sneak across the border in order to help Border Patrol.  The plan gets fouled and he finds out what happens to many Mexican immigrants: slavery, rape, and nefarious abuses.  I know someone who thought this film was sexist, but I think the main character is meant to be confused and one of his ways of showing that is through misogyny.  This director mortgaged his home in order to finance this film.  He's a cutie and you get to see his body really quickly in this work.  I wish him best of luck behind the camera, but I hope he gets to appear in front of the camera just as much.  Many people outside of California and Texas believe anything they are told about ""illegal"" immigration; this film is a low-budget, but well-intentioned, attempt to try to reverse that discourse into progressive directions.",1099872000,9,930,4.593939393939394

2117890,1,B0002SPPUU,"Not sure which as worse; the lousy acting, or the poor story line.  Taking away all the obvious technical errors of the filmthe ability to store sulfuric acid in an ordinary, everyday 2 liter plastic bottle, 30 round magazines for automatic weapons which shoot 50+ rounds at a time, an off-the-shelf video camera which has the ability to clearly film in darkness, good guys and bad guys carrying and inserting incorrect Glock magazines into their Glock pistols, this is nothing more than a stereo-typical movie; Mexicans trying to cross in the US, illegally.  And its a complete waste of time.  Less than 30 minutes in, and that was enough for me.

2117892,1,B0002SPPUU,"This movie is meant to get the viewer to empathize with the Illegal Immigrant plight but for me it backfired. The people who think the struggle the immigrants go through to cross the border is why we should have open borders are the people who like to sit in front of their 50in flat screen TV sipping on their glass of wine and conversing on what good people they are because they feel bad for the immigrants and they know better than anyone else what is good for the rest of the country, as long as it doesn't affect them!!
From where I am sitting, if the borders were closed and secured against ILLEGAL entry as is the border of every singe other country in the world, then the illegal business of sneaking people into this country would not exist and there for there would not be any exploitation of the people trying to get across. If you lock your doors at night to keep out illegal trespassers then don't you believe the borders should be locked against illegal trespassers?",1480636800,2,981,4.455555555555556

2117916,3,B0002SPPUU,"If anything this movie showed exactly WHY the U.S. needs to enforce it's already liberal immigration policies.  What are meant to propagandistically emotionally manipulative scenes show specifically how neglect of our borders and laws merely benefits and profits the most expolitive coyotes and employers.  And of course this film shows no awareness or irony regarding the reality that Mexico has the most stringent immigration laws in the world.  Whenever the U.S. meekly struggles to enforce some measures, such are merely shadows of the Mexican reality.  For example, in Mexico, being an illegal immigrant is a felony-helping someone immigrate illegally is also a crime.  The Mexican government also ruitinely deports more illegal immigrants than the U.S. could ever dream of.  I could go on.",1164931200,9,795,5.4227642276422765

8031406,2,B0002SPPUU,"Is this movie supporting or justifying illegal immigration?  There are those who are involved in human trafficking and they should be caught and prosecuted.  However, should the US Citizens/tax payers support those were ""exploited"" by these human-traffickers?  Isn't it a fact that those who either paid or somehow hooked up with human traffickers breaking US Immigration Laws and hence should also be prosecuted and deported?  I didn't see the  movie giving that message.  I found this movie quite dull and ragging.  Actors did a fine job, though.",1482192000,,548,5.2298850574712645
