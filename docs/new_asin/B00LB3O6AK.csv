8664927,1,B00LB3O6AK,"Received item fine, but did not watch item until today, unfortunately past the 30 day return window. I removed it from the wrapping and placed it in the DVD player. It started to play, but then froze up. Tried several times, removing the disc and checking for obvious errors to no avail. What a waste!! Do not recommend.",1416614400,,320,4.5344827586206895
