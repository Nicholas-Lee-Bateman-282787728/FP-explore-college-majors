8287474,5,B001CFDV3K,Funny over the top melodrama with a capable cast. I suspect the 'official' one would  contain the summer special as well.,1246147200,,121,4.761904761904762
8287475,3,B001CFDV3K,The video and sound were very good but the English subtitles were not very good. The names were all wrong and several other things wrong too. I've bought Korean dramas before and they were all ok. Maybe it's this particular company.,1234310400,3,232,4.682926829268292
