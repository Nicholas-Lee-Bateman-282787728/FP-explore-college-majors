8512348,5,B0078P8JY4,"RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE is an interesting sequel from the point of view that none of the cast from Peyton Place reprise their roles and the time period seems to have been moved up 10 or 15 years without the principal characters aging. This film retains the feel of the original in some of the scenes (especially behind the credits where many of the pastoral New England shots from the original were used), but it has a back lot studio look about it in other scenes. Unlike the original, a good portion of this story takes place in New York City as it revolves its focus amongst the pairs of main characters. The story is standard soap opera material, yet it does not fail to entertain thanks to fine performances from a menacing Mary Astor, a charming and gracious Jeff Chandler and a noble Robert Sterling. Not to its detriment nor benefit, the main characters of this piece consist of the film's younger cast members who's performances are just standard with the exception of Tuesday Weld. However, the film benefits from beautiful color photography and Franz Waxman's reworking of his original Peyton Place score and even more original music.

PEYTON PLACE with primary location photography in Camden, Maine and staring Lana Turner and Lee Philips is such an iconic classic of sorts. Franz Waxman's beautiful score is so endearing and it's main title theme is also one of the cinema's greatest melodies. A with many films, time has made this one so endearing. I always admired Lee Philips and his performance as Michael Rossi who is hired to be the new principal of the high school by the school board. Philips lends realism to this film and his character' convictions because he is not the typical Hollywood star.

The satirical wit comes through in great style and sophisticated humor in A LETTER TO THREE WIVE. A curious letter is addressed to three wives from their best friend stating that she is running away with one of their husbands. But which one? And so it goes.",1420675200,,1975,4.721739130434782
