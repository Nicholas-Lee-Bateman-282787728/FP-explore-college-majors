8261539,5,B00168AW58,This is a wonderful complement to any pilates or exercise workout routine.  Ellie Herman is an awesome instructor who carefully instructs students how to move and get the most out of their workouts.  I would recommend this to anyone who has done pilates or would like to.,1270512000,,271,4.74468085106383
8261540,4,B00168AW58,"This is a good resource for someone who practices Pilates at home on the mat. The physical demonstration of the exercises and voice-over directions are very clear and succinct. The exercises are paced so that you can actually do each exercise at the pace of the demonstrator. The downside of this product is the fact it has no menu, and you are unable to choose a specific set of exercises to do. It is a 'start-to-finish' dvd.  Also, this dvd is not appropriate for someone who has never taken Pilates with a certified instructor.",1254268800,2,531,4.648936170212766
