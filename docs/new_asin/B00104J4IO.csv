3046340,2,B00104J4IO,"""Silk"" is like a souffl; gorgeous to gaze at, but light and insubstantial. A lack of a real dramatic 'core', and the leaden performance of Michael Pitt in the lead, offsets some of the most breathtaking images of Europe and Asia I've seen in recent years.

The plot involves a young Frenchman's quest to bring black market silkworm eggs back to France, before Japan was opened to the West. Newly married to his lifelong sweetheart (Keira Knightley, who is quite good), he finds himself smitten by a beautiful Japanese concubine (Sei Ashina), who, despite never consummating with, he fantasizes about, on the basis of a note in Japanese, which hints she harbors the same feelings toward him.

Thus hangs the 'drama', and on the basis of his lifelong guilt over this unrequited love, we are to feel an emotional attachment to the Frenchman. Sadly, I couldn't, as Pitt's one-note portrayal offered little to sympathize with. I found myself wishing that James Mcavoy had been cast, as he could have provided the kind of depth the role required.

Several good actors are wasted, particularly Alfred Molina, as the visionary who arranges the earthworm missions; the story's failure certainly defeats the fabulous cinematography, as well.

""Silk"" offers far more than it delivers!",1206230400,16,1273,5.0476190476190474
3046341,1,B00104J4IO,"I was unable to view this film because the DVD, once it had run through the previews of coming attractions, would hang when the play option was chosen from the main menu.  Thinking I may simply have had a defective disk, I requested a replacement and the same problem presented itself with the replacement disk.  I ordered Ang Lee's Lust/Caution at the same time and had no problem viewing that disk.  I must surmise that the whole production run of this disk is defective.",1206144000,3,473,4.607142857142857
3046342,5,B00104J4IO,"I have seen a play production of ""Silk"" in Chicago's Goodman Theatre last year.  It was wonderfully done and it was only natural to check out the film based on the same bestselling story.  This is sophisticated love story of a young man who leaves his bride in France, while he is on the quest to find healthy silk worms in remote Japan.  It is 1800s and silk worms are still sold in secret.  Trip to retrieve them is full of dangers. One has to fight greed, tribal wars, hostile climate and unexpected infatuation with a young concubine of the local warlord.  The exotic people, culture and nature are perfect setting for two strangers from different continets and no language in common to fall for each other. Our young adventurer Herve is smitten by a quiet beauty of the concubine and her exquisite manners during tea ceremony and her other duties she is expected to perform.  While Herve is loyal to his beautiful wife Helene, his desire for the concubine is making him miserable.  What he cannot have is what he wants and unfulfilled desire is tearing him apart.  I must say that the slowness of story is more suited for the theatre than for the film, but the emotioanl charge of the story itself is just as equally powerful.  I have enjoyed this film and would recommend it with an understanding that this film may not be to everyone's taste.  One must pay close attention to the words as it is thru words, not action, that one understands the true relationship between Herve and Helene.",1204848000,4,1494,4.582706766917293
3046343,5,B00104J4IO,"This Italian-Japanese production is a quiet and visually beautiful tale of Love.  This a movie for those that appreciate the power of the unspoken.  Stunning cinematography, and tender and graceful music by Ryuichi Sakamoto.  A film to be felt on many levels.  Like a fine piece of classical music, each instrument (person/character) had a specific role to play in experiencing its message.  There are no hero's or villians here. While this film may be considered too slow for some, it is a welcome change from the frantic, action-driven pace of most films of today.",1204761600,5,566,4.9787234042553195
3046344,2,B00104J4IO,"I must say that part of my problem with this film was that it was so dark.  Not subject matter only, but the actual lighting of the film  Now I know that there was not electric light in mid-19th century French villages and not in Japan either.  But, I actually was peering at the screen trying to make some of it out.

I have not read the book and so am basing my remarks simply on the movie.  I do not understand the life-changing attraction between Herve and the concubine.  They hardly look at one another, do not share any words, know nothing about one another and yet yearn to be together.  Was it just the excitement of someone new, or the allure of someone exotic?  For an oriental woman who belongs to someone else to write ""Come back or I shall die"", there has to be some major reason.  Maybe we are to assume it was just love at first sight?

How did Helene know about the concubine?  In one scene, she and Herve are making love and she is crying.  Is it because she cannot conceive a child, or does she feel that something has changed with Herve?  I will say that the twist in the plot regarding the long letter was interesting and touching.",1204329600,8,1152,4.253456221198157
3046345,1,B00104J4IO,"This movie is a rushed, half-hearted mess!  I've loved Alfred Molina since ""Frida"" and I hope this bad film doesn't negatively impact his career.

This film works by the concept ""less is more.""  The lead characters are always tight-lipped and have close to no lines.  I think it's meant to imply that they are too deep for words, but it'll definitely make the viewer think, ""Who chopped all the dialogue out of this?!""  As a period piece, this work is kinda plain.  You see a few nice outfits and a few, very small settings.  The makers must not have had a budget to do more, or something.  You'll see better outfits and settings of Europe and Japan in films like ""Farinelli"" or ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""

While a lot of stuff is rushed, a lot of stuff is painfully prolonged.  The main character and his French wife are instantly in love.  You never see their courtship develop.  It's like they just become a couple because he's a man and she's a woman.  There's no reason why the main character should fall in love with his Japanese paramour.  Again, there is no dialogue or development for that.  I highly doubt in conservative Japan, elders would let a young lady get down with a foreigner to whom she is not married so easily.  On the other hand, when the main character first travels from France to Japan, he doesn't just take a boat.  It's like he took a coach, then a train, then a camel, then a unicorn, and then he practically swam the Sea of Japan.

Whereas Huang's ""M. Butterfly"" made an interesting and needed twist on ""Madame Butterfly,"" this film does nothing fresh to address East-West schisms.  Like always, the West is masculine, the East is feminine.  This film is highly disappointing.  It is not a well-done arthouse piece; it's a cheap impostor.",1204243200,15,1764,4.5718849840255595
3046346,1,B00104J4IO,"I rented this on the single, only, recommendation in existence (5-star) at the time. My wife says it better than I; ""I'm glad that was a free rental; too bad we got suckered right through to the end. That's 2 hours lost.""

She and I rate this movie between a 2 and 3--excruciatingly plain, with no more substance that is obviously apparent. A weak story line that can't be saved by either lead performer's presence. It might qualify as an ""art house"" movie, but that's as good a description as it deserves. Skip it, unless you're trapped indoors and can't bear watching paint dry.",1204156800,6,580,4.576923076923077
3046347,5,B00104J4IO,"For those who fell under the spell of Alessandro Baricco's novel SILK, a meditation about love, desire, and conflict, this cinematic transformation adapted as a screenplay and directed by Franois Girard will not disappoint: reservations about making Baricco's poetry visual are for the most part put to rest.  The resulting film, SILK, is supported by a sensitive cast, wondrous cinematography by Alain Dostie, a  haunting musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto, and is an appropriate extension of the beauty of Baricco's short novel.

Set in France in 1862,  Herv&eacute; Joncour (Michael Pitt) is following his family tradition of military duty until a somewhat mysterious man named Baldabiou (Alfred Molina) approaches Herv&eacute;'s father Mayor Joncour (Kenneth Welsh) with an idea to increase the tiny French town's revenues by capitalizing on the manufacture of silk. He talks the town council into fortifying his project and in a short time Baldabiou has several silk mills running.  A problem arises when an infection attacks the silkworm eggs and threatens to destroy the business.  Baldabiou convinces Herv&eacute; to travel to Africa to buy silkworm eggs to solve the dwindling supply. Herv&eacute;, meanwhile, has met and fallen in love with the beautiful H&eacute;l&egrave;ne (Keira Knightley) who is loving enough to encourage Herv&eacute;'s travel to Africa for the eggs, a trip Herv&eacute; makes and returns with eggs that make the town's mills thrive, allowing the prospering relationship between Herv&eacute; and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne to result in marriage and hopes for a happy future.

The eggs are again attacked by disease and this time Baldabiou sends Herv&eacute; to Japan where the perfect eggs can be smuggled out of the country: the trip is arduous, long (through Europe, Russia, China to Japan), and while Herv&eacute; succeeds in securing the precious eggs, he also loses his heart to the seductive eyes of the baron's concubine (Sei Ashina).  Upon returning home the town prospers, Herv&eacute; and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne try to have children, but Herv&eacute; is again forced to travel to Japan for more eggs - and to fulfill the longing to see the concubine again.  Japan is now at war and the trip is far more harrowing than before and while Herv&eacute; doesn't satisfy his desire for the concubine, she gives him a note in Japanese as he departs for France.  Upon returning to France, Herv&eacute; has the note translated: 'Come back or I shall die'.  His love for H&eacute;l&egrave;ne remains strong and he shares the experience he had in Japan.  A letter is delivered to Herv&eacute;, a beautiful love letter, and it is at this point that H&eacute;l&egrave;ne becomes ill and the events that transpire bring life to the real meaning of love in an unexpected way.

There are problems with the film: the Japanese conversations are not translated by subtitles (perhaps the director wants us to feel the alienation of a Frenchman in a strange land) making the viewer feel that chunks of the story are missing; the emphasis of the film is more concentrated on the beauty of the various locales than on the character development; Michael Pitt is a fine actor but the inner conflicts of his character are not explored well.  But these flaws are minor when the scope of the film is viewed in full.  It is a beautiful work and one that will satisfy the readers of the novel from which it was adapted.

The story is timeless and traditional; a man in love with a woman he cannot have, while trying to be loyal to his wife.  I am not a fan of films where men are married to an incredible woman, but long for something else.  It's been done far too many times, but this story takes many turns that evolve into unpredictable plot lines, each and every one being a huge surprise.  Basically, I had no idea what was going to happen next in this film.  Also, the chemistry between Pitt and his co-stars is amazing.  Knightly is perfect as his delicate wife, and Sei Ashina is also perfect as the quiet dream woman he longs to be with.  Or maybe not.  And the ending has an amazing surprise that will break your heart and make you want to go right to the beginning and watch it all over again. Also, the cinematography is breathtaking and reminded me of The Revenant in a few scenes.  Excellent film that will not leave you disappointed if you love a beautiful, tragic romance.",1465171200,6,1144,4.323943661971831

As for the movie I have two opinions.

Opinion #1 Outstanding: if you're a person with the technical skills to filter out spoken dialog and just enjoy an hour and 45 minutes of spectacular soundtrack and cinematography.

Option #2 Wretched ""2.0"":  If you lack those technical filtering skills an earlier reviewer used the word ""wretched.""  I'm not sure ""wretched"" is the right word but I cannot think of a worse one so I'll call it wretched 2.0.  Think of having a two hour root canal while staring at a broken clock.

it occurs to me that nothing ever happens between the two potential lovers. so the story is reduced to a couple of hours of longing and remembered longing.

I found the story compelling.  Love and desire, and how they weigh on the psyche, and the torment and anguish they can cause.

The actors provided the framework and the story was told in a more visual and musical sense.  When put all together they seemed to click with me.

3046382,2,B00104J4IO,"""Silk"" was a film that I'd been eyeballing for quite some time, lured by its romantic cover of Keira Knightley in period dress and embracing actor Michael Pitt, their noses touching and suggestive of an imminent kiss.  I realized after watching it that I got the most enjoyment out of just looking at the DVD cover.  ""Silk"" is an incredible bore that has the misfortune of two very good actors (Molina, Knightley) trying to propel limp material.

The story takes place in 19th century France - Herv&eacute; Joncour (Pitt) is a former military officer who happily abandons his career for another: trading silkworm eggs.  Due to a disease that begins affecting and killing off the local population, he is bid by his associate Baldabiou (Molina) to travel abroad for healthy eggs.  He travels first to Africa, then to Japan, attempting to smuggle back eggs that will hatch healthy silkworms and produce massive amounts of silk, thereby bringing substantial profit.

His journeys to these strange countries are long and arduous and keep him away from his young beautiful wife H&eacute;l&egrave;ne (Knightley), who desperately wants a child.  While in Japan, Herv&eacute; inexplicably becomes obsessed with a local man's concubine and when given a note from her, he finds a high-end Japanese prostitute back in France who translates it.  The note reads: Come back or I shall die.

Despite a revolt in Japan, Herv&eacute; insists on returning there due to his urge to find the concubine and encounters hostility beyond what he thought possible.  The trip is a lost cause - there is no sign of the woman he sought and all of the eggs he procures hatch prematurely and are therefore worthless.  Returning home once again, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne finds him a changed man (not for the better) and he finds her a melancholy woman, one who unbeknownst to him is wise to the reason for his return to Japan.

The film ends on a sad note and with not much of a resolution - Herv&eacute; never found what he was looking for and in his ignorant obsession, loses what's most important to him.  In short, it was a waste of film on several accounts: story, screenplay and acting combined.

Fans of Keira Knightley won't get even half of what they expect from her in this film, the onscreen time largely belonging to Michael Pitt as Herv&eacute; Joncour.  Pitt is flat, dispassionate and utterly uninteresting - his voice rarely projects above the volume of a private conversation and is sorely lacking in inflection.  With a monotone delivery to match his vacant face, the man may as well be an android and it makes me wonder whether this is the kind of performance that director Franois Girard (The Red Violin) wanted all along (that, or he did nothing to coax Pitt into giving more).  If so, it deeply discourages me from reading the novel on which this film was based, as it's high unlikely I'll put up with a dry and lethargic character like Herv&eacute; for very long before giving up on the story entirely.

Alfred Molina is the saving grace of the film's many performance issues, managing to take what little he has and still make a good impression.  The rest of the cast are largely unknown and blend in with the background, a scene-stealer in its own right; the film's luscious cinematography comes courtesy of Alain Dostie with location shoots divided between Japan and Italy.  There are plenty of resplendent and artsy shots of the wintry landscapes in the Japanese town of Sakata as well as a verdant and fairytale-like milieu for the Joncour estate in the medieval village of Sermoneta, Italy.

Sound on this particular DVD is horrid - I found myself cranking the volume WAY up and still had trouble hearing certain people (Pitt in particular, what with his maddening mumbling).

Bottom line: Fans of Alessandro Barrico's novella would do well to avoid this somnolent adaptation - it is a useless companion to the book and does nothing to elevate the Italian author's prose or illuminate the story.  If you're in a deep dark pit of boredom, the ennui of ""Silk"" will keep you trapped there.",1234310400,4,4079,4.837410071942446
3046383,4,B00104J4IO,"Critics of the film are well within their rights to find male lead Michael Pitt a curious and somewhat leaden choice. Still overall, I find the extraordinary beauty of the settings he moves in to be compelling; can't think of another film that uses old villages in Italy (standing in for France) and Japan to such extraordinary effect.

There really isn't a scene in ""Silk"" that isn't beautiful on its own and depicting an almost Utopian loveliness to  the 1860s period in France and Japan.

Though the story is reminiscent of ""Shogun"" and all other outsiders-confront-Japan movies (see Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"" etc. etc.), I did enjoy the plot twist involving his wife's insight and simple devotion ... to say more would spoil the film.

I've seen ""Silk"" and ""The Painted Veil"" one after the other recently, and might have to say I preferred ""Silk"" in terms of having a more complex and subtle message. Both offer many beautiful visions of East Asia and help us think about how Westerners fare in their travels there.",1232064000,3,1025,4.806818181818182
3046384,1,B00104J4IO,"I'm not going to go into any details, but I will say that I wish Amazon could refund the time I spent watching this movie. It looked like it would have promise but in the end it was a big dud. Watch it at your own risk!",1231200000,3,219,3.6808510638297873
3046385,1,B00104J4IO,"It's been years since I read the Alessandro Barrico novella this film was based off, but what I do remember is its slight weight - the book is 91 pages long, the pages being not much bigger than your average Japanese paperback and a good many of them only half-inscribed. The book is minimalist and quite heavily stylised in its language. Translating such a book onto celluloid would be a tough ask for anyone.

'Silk', like its namesake, certainly looks the part. The entire film has been beautifully shot, and landscapes that depict the main character, Herve's, crossing of Eurasia are particularly breathtaking. Costumes, sets, every visual has been executed with an eye to even the smallest detail. 'Silk' is sumptuous to look upon. Unfortunately, that's about all the film has to recommend itself.

Plotwise, the film narrative follows the book adequately. Herve Joncour (Michael Pitt), on leave from the French Army in 1862, returns to the small French village where his father is mayor and falls in love with the local school teacher, Helene (Keira Knightley); he's promised a helping hand in marrying her by the entrepreneur, Baldabiou (Alfred Molina), if he agrees to fetch silkworm eggs to replenish the town's disease-ridden stocks. Herve of course agrees, gets to marry Helene, and soon enough is on his way to Japan, where he becomes infatuated with the village headman's beautiful, silent concubine. The rest of the film is concerned with the results of this infatuation over the course of the next decade or so. Coming as it does from such a skeletal book, stretching the film out to two hours was a mistake. The action crawls at a pace that would put a snail to shame, and most of the plot developments are predictable (barring the final revelation, which even in the book I thought was ridiculous).

This was a script that relied heavily on its actors to bring fresh life to characters and stories that audiences these days are all too familiar with. And therein lies my biggest gripe with 'Silk'. In the hands of a charismatic or capable lead actor, the film may have overcome its stilted pacing, but whoever decided to cast Michael Pitt in the lead role might have been better off casting two planks of wood. There's very little connection with the character and no attempts made to connect with the audience; Pitt has, if I might borrow a phrase from Hermione Granger, the emotional range of a teaspoon. Every line (including endless voiceovers) is delivered in the same unremarkable, Romeo-in-the-tenth-grade-play mumble. Pitt looks throughout the entire film either half-asleep, stoned or suffering the after-effects of a stroke. As a lead actor in a romantic drama about unrequited love and passionate obsession, his is possibly one of the worst performances in recent memory.

It's only Keira Knightley's performance as the faithful Helene that rescues this film from complete frigidity. Known mostly to me in roles where the adjectives 'exaggerated', 'extroverted' or 'spirited' are simply bywords for 'annoying as all get out', Knightley shows surprising restraint in her portrayal of Helene as the childless wife, growing more weary and heartsore as the years pass, knowing full well her husband's heart is (supposed to be) possessed by another. Despite her dearth of screen time, in the end it is Helene's anguish and turmoil that provides the only real emotional connection within the film.

I was disappointed with the film's rather stereotypical portrayal of Japan as the Inscrutable Orient. The village headman is kindness and generosity itself until he (inevitably, inexplicably) turns on Herve. The nameless women are presented as subservient to the point of mutability; the headman's concubine disappears into the onsen waters as though her existence were nothing more than a wisp of smoke. Japanese women here are basically reduced to sexual objects, so much so the only one permitted to speak is a prostitute, plying her trade in France. Incredibly disappointing.

Overall, 'Silk' is a beautiful looking film that is seriously hampered with issues of pacing and a lead actor who couldn't act his way out of a mime's imaginary box. Devotees of landscapes, cinematography, or Keira Knightley might get something out of it, but for the general populace - do yourself a favour and just read the book (it'll take less time).",1229212800,13,4356,5.059888579387187
3046386,2,B00104J4IO,"Well, I just finished watching Silk, and all I can think about is the hour and a half of my life I'll never get back...The scenery in this movie is a feast for the eyes, and the only pro as the dull and lifeless script made me fast-forward through most of the movie. I found the characters to be very underdeveloped, as well as the plot; specifically I had issue when Michael Pitt's character Herve develops an fixation with a Japanese concubine, which is a major reason why he makes repeated trips back to Japan (the backbone of the movie), seems very unfounded; the two have very little screen time and no dialogue, yet an ""obsession"" blooms.

If you're patient, attentive, and open to the nuances that abound, this is a rewarding, rich film that is at times brutally candid and at others, dreamily opulent with wonder.

The location of the story is France in 1862. Herve (Michael Pitt) is convinced by Baldabiou (Alfred Molina) to travel in search of silkworm eggs in order to save the silk-making business. Herve travels to Africa and Japan. During his trip to Japan, he falls in love with a Japanese concubine. When he returns home to France, he cannot forget the Japanese beauty and continues to obsessively long for her.

The untranslated Japanese conversations allows the audience to relate to the main character, as he too does not understand the language. Keira Knightly made a wonderful `Hlne' but I wasn't convinced by Michael Pitt as the main character `Herv Joncour'; the obsessive inner turmoil wasn't portrayed well on screen. Overall, however, I think the film is well-worth seeing.",1215561600,,1018,5.017751479289941
3046389,1,B00104J4IO,"Like many well-intentioned adaptations, ""Silk"" fails in its horrible execution.  We supposedly have an adventurous silk trader, Herve Joncour (Michael Pitt), who undertakes the perilous journey from France to Japan in the mid-1800s in search of blight-free silkworm eggs that would ensure his village's prosperity in the silk industry.  Married to a fetching wife and, from all accounts, in love with her, our intrepid traveler becomes obsessed with a Japanese concubine in his first trek to Yamagata.  On the pretext that Japan's silkworm eggs are worth the frequent traveler miles, Herve returns to Japan to obtain yet another glimpse of his amour.  We are obliged to accept that the largely lethargic Pitt traverses these thousands of miles (3 times!) by carriage, rail, ship, caravan and horseback, when it looks like he can't even get across town without being toppled by a strong breeze.  Straining to evoke a Dr. Zhivago-like epic, it only succeeds at looking ludicrous.  Permanently sporting a pout like a child scolded for playing with worms, Pitt mumbles in a monotone with one wooden facial expression all throughout, in perfect accompaniment to his sleep-deprived droning voiceover narration for the film's painful 110 minutes.  As badly miscast and as anemic as Pitt's acting is, it is equaled, agonizingly enough, by the same lifeless performance of Keira Knightley as Herve's wife Helene.  Mostly relegated to bidding Herve a spiritless goodbye whenever he departs and a spiritless hello whenever he returns, one wonders if the absence of affect and chemistry with the two was a joke on the audience that they secretly delighted in.

It may have been possible to forgive such lackluster acting if there was a story to behold.  When the procurement of silkworm eggs is more riveting than Herve's infatuation with the unnamed concubine, then I know there's no redemption.  I am as perplexed as those who've seen director Francois Girard's ""Red Violin"" in the `90s, a magnificent film that remains one of my favorites to this day.  A feudal Japan of the 1800s, still closed to the west, with its warring warlords and bewildering culture would have been ripe for exposition, injecting the much-needed tensions and conflicts the film sorely lacks.  To not have attempted to incorporate it in any meaningful way with the lame love story was a fatal mistake.  At least, it could have given the dying plot a fighting chance.  This is nothing more than another dull and dreary depiction of the white man's fantasy of the submissive, exotic female, a stereotype that really is getting old.

I'm no stranger to arthouse, but honestly, it's films like this that give arthouse a bad reputation.  The fantastic cinematography in ""Silk,"" with breathtaking panoramic shots of Japan in winter, cannot rescue this inferior film.  I've seen nature documentaries on PBS with more gist and drama than this turgid exercise.  Come to think of it, I've seen turtles with more passion.",1213833600,39,2975,5.109504132231405

I am so glad that I did not return it! Silk is a visual masterpiece about a mayors son named Herve who falls in love with a beautiful young women named helene. Every thing seems like It's going to be picture perfect about that time a man named Baldabiou has ideas of opening the run-down silk mill the only problem is there is a disease killing all the silk eggs in france and without the eggs there can be no silk mill. Baldabiou approaches Herve and tells him about going to Africa to retrive the eggs Herve accepts. Helene does not want Herve to leave there are recently married but she does not want to be a burden. After succesfully retriving the eggs Herve must go on another journey to japan. Some of the eggs are dead and Baldabiou sees that as a very bad sign. Leaving his wife again he sets out on a tough journey and falls in love with the mistress of a powerful japanese baron. Herve ends up going again and becoming more obsessed with her and at one point after finding a note saying ""come back or I shall die"". while Helene is at home lonely and waiting for Herve ( How sad!)
Pros: Silk is very beautiful visualy! great cineamatography. Lovely Costumes. And a beautiful score that should have won an oscar. Another Great thing about the film was Keira Knightley as Helene. She was so beautiful in her costumes and her performance was very touching and very subtle yet heart breaking!
Cons: Michael Pitt is not as good Keira Knightley and pouts and tries to act cute. Other then that.....................................

This movie was painful.  Really, really painful.  Nothing of any consequence happened... or seemed to.  The story was all in the background, a context through which the characters altogether failed to move.  Keira Knightly is breathtaking, but she and Alfred Molina portray the only two characters who seem to have any life to them whatsoever.  She was really only in a few scenes, nowhere near enough to redeem this production.  The main character was sodden, gloomy, and altogether uninteresting.  The best single word to describe him would be ""pathetic"" if only there were some pathos, some connection between him and the viewer.  Sadly, that connection so spectacularly fails to develop that, when I found that I had missed a line of muttered or mumbled dialog (the majority of the plot is conveyed via a sort of moaning, whispered narrative voice over) I found that I really did not care.

3046394,2,B00104J4IO,"Based on the prose-poem novel by Alessandro Baricco, director Francois Girard's `Silk' excruciates its audience by trying way too hard to be a beautiful genre film complete with spectacularly photographed vistas of France and Japan, profoundly symphonic music and the kind of pretty crinoline-d costumes in which most bodice-ripping aficionados would want to be corseted.  However attractive, `Silk' wears thin right from the get-go.

Michael Pitt, severely miscast as Herve Joncour (why not James McAvoy?), plays this 19th century purveyor of silk eggs--a supposed intrepid adventurer traveling from Lyon to Africa and Japan--with a spectrum of emotions limited to a flat line expression of distracted cherub-faced banality.  Does anything faze this person?  Is his cravat tied too tightly?  Not really--Pitt spends most of the movie in kimono, so he's definitely comfortable.  Nevertheless, when Herve experiences sensual exquisiteness--be it women (two lusciously yet polarly different beauties--the fair Helene (Keira Knightly) and the nameless dark and sultry Japanese concubine (Sei Ashina) or nature--- he flitters through a pastel flower-strewn rendition of Monet's France (Girard's scene at the beach captures in essence the painting ""La Promenade, la Femme a l'Ombrelle"") and meanders through a misty art house imagining of rural Japan that suggests the fragile Haiku tension of ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", he pouts with the one-note prissiness that stamps him as a graduate in fine standing from the quintessential ""you'll-never-understand-me"" school of teen television drama, ""Dawson's Creek. With blue-green eyes that are quick to water - his only visual sign of emotion, other than a slackness of his full lips--he stumbles through 20 years of his life on a confused quest for his idea of perfection.  Ironically, Helene, his wife, waits at home for the garden and child she has promised herself while he pants over his conceptualization of a woman with whom he has never spoken with the persistence and deadened optimism of a voyeur clicking through mega-sites of Internet porn.

So what's it all about and is it worth two hours of the viewer's time?  No.  Even for die-hard Knightly fans, `Silk' offers scant opportunity for this actress to really hone her craft and shine in any way other than that of a lovely accoutrement to an already lovely backdrop.  She spends most of her screen time in a languorous pre-`Atonement' wait state-- I have come to think of this film as an exercise to her more intense character of Cecelia opposite James McAvoy in `Atonement.'  There, too, her angular body is positioned in an ultimate welcoming or goodbye posture.  Here, she is less bitter, her jaw still clenched while her arms remain outstretched ready to grab her errant husband to her bosom each and every time he returns from his trek for eggs.  Sadly, unfulfilled in her inability to conceive a child or understand her husband's restlessness--of this I conjecture, as the plot of the film reveals little of the underpinnings of her mind--she conveys an overall feeling of the unessential role women, in general, portrayed in life then and perhaps, even in life today.

And just how are women depicted?  If we enjoy a football game, we are inundated with glimpses of cheerleader's legs, breasts and swatches of long hair swaying.  If we like cars or cameras, well, there is always a model or two glad to sell you the latest technological advancement while allowing a glimpse or two of their corporeal delicatessens.  It comes as no surprise that there are certain women who sell their sexuality to make their way in a world that has been designed by men. Are we to believe that that is the only alternative?  In `Silk,' a film intended to be appealingly romantic to women, we again are reminded that women hold a secondary role--the concubine does not speak, yet Herve is entranced--by what?  Her subservience?  Helene is fetching indeed, but as Herve doesn't seem to care, why should we?  All those poetic musings in the Baricco novel come off as the usual stereotypical drivel that reduces women to commodities rather than flesh and blood individuals with needs of their own.  Shame on you, M. Girard. I might as well watch the Speed Channel.

Bottom line?  Don't waste your time or your money on this one. The plot is boring. The actors wallow in self-pity.  Yes, the photography waxes aesthetic but you would do better with a picture book of exotic locales. The  music accentuates the maudlin nauseating character study of the insipid Herve, but I'd rather listen to something truly impassioned like Rachmaninoff.  Personally, I am tired of the mentality of depicting pretty women being flaunted as tidbits to make men's lives more comfortable, be it a Playboy spread or a tea ceremony.  Enough already.  I can deal with a little manipulation.  Just show me some strength.

I awarded this movie two stars, both of which go to Alfred Molina as Herve's boisterous boss man.  He is the only player that livened up the so-called action in this snore fest.  Not recommended.

It's interesting to watch with somebody of the opposite sex that you don't know well. You could tell a few things about her afterwards, like: Does she like classical music? Does she feel anything when watching splendid landscapes? Is she intelligent enough to figure the story's twist near the end? (I wasn't even close) Does she like ""slow"" movies? Can she withstand a moderate dose of ""drama""? Can she feel Helene's plight?

The musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto was superb, but we shouldn't be surprised given director Franois Girard's last films.
The only character I really liked was Afred Molina's ""Baldabiou"".
He's an entrepreneur with flavour for life. Likeable, tough but sensitive. A ""father figure"" to ""Herve"", who sorely needs one with such a bore of a father!
Herve's attitude to life was a bit strange to me. My friend said something that's always been there: ""he never smiles"". True, he barely winces, never seems to be happy, just like drowsily fulfilling a desk job.
Schuyler was great in his small role. How a street smart adversary can become a restrained source of practical wisdom!
Madame Blanche is also a necessary small role, but that has the life experience Herve will always lack.
He surely got sympathy from smart strangers!
I didn't get involved in Ludovic Berbek's story, although it's there with the clear intention of moving us. I also thought all this story of ""marital unhappiness"", infertility and she crying as they made love was a bit contrived.
I will never like Keira, but at least she doesn't look like a ""tomboy beanpole"" (!) as she said on one interview. Which wouldn't be becoming for her ""modest wife"" role.
She's not as good as her Guinevere, but at least she does her rather plain role without showing off. She doesn't look anorexic like in other roles. Maybe she didn't endure wearing a corset like on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

The best review I read was ""Grady Harp from United States"". I think it deserves to be the one you read first.
Jae-Ha Kim from Amazon is a good critical take. But I'm glad I didn't read it before watching the film, as it speaks about a twist that should be left alone :)!

My favourite scene is when the local baron shows cold Herve the peaceful place he and his ancestors enjoy for watching nature and connecting with nature. And the one in the bathtub, very tender in a sexually restrained world.
I also wanted to ""have a garden"" after watching this, thou I content myself with some plants in the balcony :)!
And Japan shows itself like a harsh country, both geographically and with respect to the Japanese. An ancient land with rules hard to understand by any westerner.
I did like the fact that the Japanese dialogues weren't subtitled. Unlike ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" & even ""the last Samurai"" I think that made us feel a bit like it must have been.

3046396,5,B00104J4IO,"""Silk"" is by far, the best love story to be filmed thus far. Michael Pitt and Keira Knightley are fantastic. This film is a stunning adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's novel.

The question is, did she know of her husband's infidelities, half a world away? Or was he just deluding himself, believing that a Warlord's concubine would place herself in that much peril, by corresponding with him? These questions are answered, and more, so deftly and passionately, that it is difficult not to be moved by this film.

The story concerns the ""beginning"" of the Silk Trade with Japan, some years before it was to be made official. Herve' Joncours (Michael Pitt) is contracted to go to Japan, illegally, to procure silkworm eggs, for the manufacture of silk, which is becoming the height of fashion in Europe. His relationship with smugglers in Japan is becoming more of a draw for Herve' than the eggs. He meets a concubine of the local warlord, and his loyalties and love are tested, as he is drawn to this mysterious woman, who he cannot possibly have.

On his return to Europe, he finds it difficult to resume his marital ""duties"". It is by his own ingeniuity, that he is instrumental in keeping his village from starving, when the silk trade dies. He is haunted by a letter, written in Japanese, that is translated for him, but by whose hand? Why?

The casting was superb, as were the sets and settings. You are convincingly transported back to the mid-1800's. Michael Pitt and Keira Knightley are fast becoming accomplished actors. The period was correct, for Japan was just coming to grips with the ""modern era"", and the Samurai period was to end. ""Silk"" is a superb achievement.

Keira Knightley is the vision of loveliness her audience has come to expect but love interest Michael Pitt is way over his head, failing to display the emotional depth and angst required for this role.

In most cases of pretentious B-movie drivel, the presence of a lovely and talented actress such as Keira Knightly acts as a sort of consolation prize. No such luck: she somnambulates through this train wreck as though she herself finds it hard to accept that she is really a part of the fiasco.

The scene where she undresses for Herve makes her seem even more like more of a commodity or prostitute.  Notwithstanding, the only other major Asian female role was an expensive Japanese prostitute in Europe.  It seems to be some nostalgic tribute to the ways of the past.  Perhaps it would be less stereotypical and more insightful if the Asian characters had been better developed, like in Memoirs of a Geisha.  This movie was extremely slow--maybe we Americans don't have that kind of patience for this--and the undeveloped story required so much reading between the lines that I still don't totally get it.

The plot involves a young Frenchman's quest to bring black market silkworm eggs back to France, before Japan was opened to the West. Newly married to his lifelong sweetheart (Keira Knightley, who is quite good), he finds himself smitten by a beautiful Japanese concubine (Sei Ashina), who, despite never consummating with, he fantasizes about, on the basis of a note in Japanese, which hints she harbors the same feelings toward him.

Thus hangs the 'drama', and on the basis of his lifelong guilt over this unrequited love, we are to feel an emotional attachment to the Frenchman. Sadly, I couldn't, as Pitt's one-note portrayal offered little to sympathize with. I found myself wishing that James Mcavoy had been cast, as he could have provided the kind of depth the role required.

Several good actors are wasted, particularly Alfred Molina, as the visionary who arranges the earthworm missions; the story's failure certainly defeats the fabulous cinematography, as well.

This is sophisticated love story of a young man who leaves his bride in France, while he is on the quest to find healthy silk worms in remote Japan.  It is 1800s and silk worms are still sold in secret.  Trip to retrieve them is full of dangers. One has to fight greed, tribal wars, hostile climate and unexpected infatuation with a young concubine of the local warlord.  The exotic people, culture and nature are perfect setting for two strangers from different continets and no language in common to fall for each other. Our young adventurer Herve is smitten by a quiet beauty of the concubine and her exquisite manners during tea ceremony and her other duties she is expected to perform.  While Herve is loyal to his beautiful wife Helene, his desire for the concubine is making him miserable.  What he cannot have is what he wants and unfulfilled desire is tearing him apart.  I must say that the slowness of story is more suited for the theatre than for the film, but the emotioanl charge of the story itself is just as equally powerful.

3280841,2,B00104J4IO,"I must say that part of my problem with this film was that it was so dark.  Not subject matter only, but the actual lighting of the film  Now I know that there was not electric light in mid-19th century French villages and not in Japan either.  But, I actually was peering at the screen trying to make some of it out.

I have not read the book and so am basing my remarks simply on the movie.  I do not understand the life-changing attraction between Herve and the concubine.  They hardly look at one another, do not share any words, know nothing about one another and yet yearn to be together.  Was it just the excitement of someone new, or the allure of someone exotic?  For an oriental woman who belongs to someone else to write ""Come back or I shall die"", there has to be some major reason.  Maybe we are to assume it was just love at first sight?

How did Helene know about the concubine?  In one scene, she and Herve are making love and she is crying.  Is it because she cannot conceive a child, or does she feel that something has changed with Herve?  I will say that the twist in the plot regarding the long letter was interesting and touching.",1204329600,8,1152,4.253456221198157
3280842,1,B00104J4IO,"This movie is a rushed, half-hearted mess!  I've loved Alfred Molina since ""Frida"" and I hope this bad film doesn't negatively impact his career.

This film works by the concept ""less is more.""  The lead characters are always tight-lipped and have close to no lines.  I think it's meant to imply that they are too deep for words, but it'll definitely make the viewer think, ""Who chopped all the dialogue out of this?!""  As a period piece, this work is kinda plain.  You see a few nice outfits and a few, very small settings.  The makers must not have had a budget to do more, or something.  You'll see better outfits and settings of Europe and Japan in films like ""Farinelli"" or ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""

While a lot of stuff is rushed, a lot of stuff is painfully prolonged.  The main character and his French wife are instantly in love.  You never see their courtship develop.  It's like they just become a couple because he's a man and she's a woman.  There's no reason why the main character should fall in love with his Japanese paramour.  Again, there is no dialogue or development for that.  I highly doubt in conservative Japan, elders would let a young lady get down with a foreigner to whom she is not married so easily.  On the other hand, when the main character first travels from France to Japan, he doesn't just take a boat.  It's like he took a coach, then a train, then a camel, then a unicorn, and then he practically swam the Sea of Japan.

Whereas Huang's ""M. Butterfly"" made an interesting and needed twist on ""Madame Butterfly,"" this film does nothing fresh to address East-West schisms.  Like always, the West is masculine, the East is feminine.  This film is highly disappointing.  It is not a well-done arthouse piece; it's a cheap impostor.",1204243200,15,1764,4.5718849840255595

3280844,5,B00104J4IO,"For those who fell under the spell of Alessandro Baricco's novel SILK, a meditation about love, desire, and conflict, this cinematic transformation adapted as a screenplay and directed by Franois Girard will not disappoint: reservations about making Baricco's poetry visual are for the most part put to rest.  The resulting film, SILK, is supported by a sensitive cast, wondrous cinematography by Alain Dostie, a  haunting musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto, and is an appropriate extension of the beauty of Baricco's short novel.

Set in France in 1862,  Herv&eacute; Joncour (Michael Pitt) is following his family tradition of military duty until a somewhat mysterious man named Baldabiou (Alfred Molina) approaches Herv&eacute;'s father Mayor Joncour (Kenneth Welsh) with an idea to increase the tiny French town's revenues by capitalizing on the manufacture of silk. He talks the town council into fortifying his project and in a short time Baldabiou has several silk mills running.  A problem arises when an infection attacks the silkworm eggs and threatens to destroy the business.  Baldabiou convinces Herv&eacute; to travel to Africa to buy silkworm eggs to solve the dwindling supply. Herv&eacute;, meanwhile, has met and fallen in love with the beautiful H&eacute;l&egrave;ne (Keira Knightley) who is loving enough to encourage Herv&eacute;'s travel to Africa for the eggs, a trip Herv&eacute; makes and returns with eggs that make the town's mills thrive, allowing the prospering relationship between Herv&eacute; and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne to result in marriage and hopes for a happy future.

The eggs are again attacked by disease and this time Baldabiou sends Herv&eacute; to Japan where the perfect eggs can be smuggled out of the country: the trip is arduous, long (through Europe, Russia, China to Japan), and while Herv&eacute; succeeds in securing the precious eggs, he also loses his heart to the seductive eyes of the baron's concubine (Sei Ashina).  Upon returning home the town prospers, Herv&eacute; and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne try to have children, but Herv&eacute; is again forced to travel to Japan for more eggs - and to fulfill the longing to see the concubine again.  Japan is now at war and the trip is far more harrowing than before and while Herv&eacute; doesn't satisfy his desire for the concubine, she gives him a note in Japanese as he departs for France.  Upon returning to France, Herv&eacute; has the note translated: 'Come back or I shall die'.  His love for H&eacute;l&egrave;ne remains strong and he shares the experience he had in Japan.  A letter is delivered to Herv&eacute;, a beautiful love letter, and it is at this point that H&eacute;l&egrave;ne becomes ill and the events that transpire bring life to the real meaning of love in an unexpected way.

There are problems with the film: the Japanese conversations are not translated by subtitles (perhaps the director wants us to feel the alienation of a Frenchman in a strange land) making the viewer feel that chunks of the story are missing; the emphasis of the film is more concentrated on the beauty of the various locales than on the character development; Michael Pitt is a fine actor but the inner conflicts of his character are not explored well.  But these flaws are minor when the scope of the film is viewed in full.  It is a beautiful work and one that will satisfy the readers of the novel from which it was adapted.

The story is timeless and traditional; a man in love with a woman he cannot have, while trying to be loyal to his wife.  I am not a fan of films where men are married to an incredible woman, but long for something else.  It's been done far too many times, but this story takes many turns that evolve into unpredictable plot lines, each and every one being a huge surprise.  Basically, I had no idea what was going to happen next in this film.  Also, the chemistry between Pitt and his co-stars is amazing.  Knightly is perfect as his delicate wife, and Sei Ashina is also perfect as the quiet dream woman he longs to be with.  Or maybe not.  And the ending has an amazing surprise that will break your heart and make you want to go right to the beginning and watch it all over again.

3280879,2,B00104J4IO,"""Silk"" was a film that I'd been eyeballing for quite some time, lured by its romantic cover of Keira Knightley in period dress and embracing actor Michael Pitt, their noses touching and suggestive of an imminent kiss.  I realized after watching it that I got the most enjoyment out of just looking at the DVD cover.  ""Silk"" is an incredible bore that has the misfortune of two very good actors (Molina, Knightley) trying to propel limp material.

The story takes place in 19th century France - Herv&eacute; Joncour (Pitt) is a former military officer who happily abandons his career for another: trading silkworm eggs.  Due to a disease that begins affecting and killing off the local population, he is bid by his associate Baldabiou (Molina) to travel abroad for healthy eggs.  He travels first to Africa, then to Japan, attempting to smuggle back eggs that will hatch healthy silkworms and produce massive amounts of silk, thereby bringing substantial profit.

His journeys to these strange countries are long and arduous and keep him away from his young beautiful wife H&eacute;l&egrave;ne (Knightley), who desperately wants a child.  While in Japan, Herv&eacute; inexplicably becomes obsessed with a local man's concubine and when given a note from her, he finds a high-end Japanese prostitute back in France who translates it.  The note reads: Come back or I shall die.

Despite a revolt in Japan, Herv&eacute; insists on returning there due to his urge to find the concubine and encounters hostility beyond what he thought possible.  The trip is a lost cause - there is no sign of the woman he sought and all of the eggs he procures hatch prematurely and are therefore worthless.  Returning home once again, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne finds him a changed man (not for the better) and he finds her a melancholy woman, one who unbeknownst to him is wise to the reason for his return to Japan.

The film ends on a sad note and with not much of a resolution - Herv&eacute; never found what he was looking for and in his ignorant obsession, loses what's most important to him.  In short, it was a waste of film on several accounts: story, screenplay and acting combined.

Fans of Keira Knightley won't get even half of what they expect from her in this film, the onscreen time largely belonging to Michael Pitt as Herv&eacute; Joncour.  Pitt is flat, dispassionate and utterly uninteresting - his voice rarely projects above the volume of a private conversation and is sorely lacking in inflection.  With a monotone delivery to match his vacant face, the man may as well be an android and it makes me wonder whether this is the kind of performance that director Franois Girard (The Red Violin) wanted all along (that, or he did nothing to coax Pitt into giving more).  If so, it deeply discourages me from reading the novel on which this film was based, as it's high unlikely I'll put up with a dry and lethargic character like Herv&eacute; for very long before giving up on the story entirely.

Alfred Molina is the saving grace of the film's many performance issues, managing to take what little he has and still make a good impression.  The rest of the cast are largely unknown and blend in with the background, a scene-stealer in its own right; the film's luscious cinematography comes courtesy of Alain Dostie with location shoots divided between Japan and Italy.  There are plenty of resplendent and artsy shots of the wintry landscapes in the Japanese town of Sakata as well as a verdant and fairytale-like milieu for the Joncour estate in the medieval village of Sermoneta, Italy.

Sound on this particular DVD is horrid - I found myself cranking the volume WAY up and still had trouble hearing certain people (Pitt in particular, what with his maddening mumbling).

Bottom line: Fans of Alessandro Barrico's novella would do well to avoid this somnolent adaptation - it is a useless companion to the book and does nothing to elevate the Italian author's prose or illuminate the story.  If you're in a deep dark pit of boredom, the ennui of ""Silk"" will keep you trapped there.",1234310400,4,4079,4.837410071942446
3280880,4,B00104J4IO,"Critics of the film are well within their rights to find male lead Michael Pitt a curious and somewhat leaden choice. Still overall, I find the extraordinary beauty of the settings he moves in to be compelling; can't think of another film that uses old villages in Italy (standing in for France) and Japan to such extraordinary effect.

There really isn't a scene in ""Silk"" that isn't beautiful on its own and depicting an almost Utopian loveliness to  the 1860s period in France and Japan.

Though the story is reminiscent of ""Shogun"" and all other outsiders-confront-Japan movies (see Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"" etc. etc.), I did enjoy the plot twist involving his wife's insight and simple devotion ... to say more would spoil the film.

I've seen ""Silk"" and ""The Painted Veil"" one after the other recently, and might have to say I preferred ""Silk"" in terms of having a more complex and subtle message. Both offer many beautiful visions of East Asia and help us think about how Westerners fare in their travels there.",1232064000,3,1025,4.806818181818182

3280882,1,B00104J4IO,"It's been years since I read the Alessandro Barrico novella this film was based off, but what I do remember is its slight weight - the book is 91 pages long, the pages being not much bigger than your average Japanese paperback and a good many of them only half-inscribed. The book is minimalist and quite heavily stylised in its language. Translating such a book onto celluloid would be a tough ask for anyone.

'Silk', like its namesake, certainly looks the part. The entire film has been beautifully shot, and landscapes that depict the main character, Herve's, crossing of Eurasia are particularly breathtaking. Costumes, sets, every visual has been executed with an eye to even the smallest detail. 'Silk' is sumptuous to look upon. Unfortunately, that's about all the film has to recommend itself.

Plotwise, the film narrative follows the book adequately. Herve Joncour (Michael Pitt), on leave from the French Army in 1862, returns to the small French village where his father is mayor and falls in love with the local school teacher, Helene (Keira Knightley); he's promised a helping hand in marrying her by the entrepreneur, Baldabiou (Alfred Molina), if he agrees to fetch silkworm eggs to replenish the town's disease-ridden stocks. Herve of course agrees, gets to marry Helene, and soon enough is on his way to Japan, where he becomes infatuated with the village headman's beautiful, silent concubine. The rest of the film is concerned with the results of this infatuation over the course of the next decade or so. Coming as it does from such a skeletal book, stretching the film out to two hours was a mistake. The action crawls at a pace that would put a snail to shame, and most of the plot developments are predictable (barring the final revelation, which even in the book I thought was ridiculous).

This was a script that relied heavily on its actors to bring fresh life to characters and stories that audiences these days are all too familiar with. And therein lies my biggest gripe with 'Silk'. In the hands of a charismatic or capable lead actor, the film may have overcome its stilted pacing, but whoever decided to cast Michael Pitt in the lead role might have been better off casting two planks of wood. There's very little connection with the character and no attempts made to connect with the audience; Pitt has, if I might borrow a phrase from Hermione Granger, the emotional range of a teaspoon. Every line (including endless voiceovers) is delivered in the same unremarkable, Romeo-in-the-tenth-grade-play mumble. Pitt looks throughout the entire film either half-asleep, stoned or suffering the after-effects of a stroke. As a lead actor in a romantic drama about unrequited love and passionate obsession, his is possibly one of the worst performances in recent memory.

It's only Keira Knightley's performance as the faithful Helene that rescues this film from complete frigidity. Known mostly to me in roles where the adjectives 'exaggerated', 'extroverted' or 'spirited' are simply bywords for 'annoying as all get out', Knightley shows surprising restraint in her portrayal of Helene as the childless wife, growing more weary and heartsore as the years pass, knowing full well her husband's heart is (supposed to be) possessed by another. Despite her dearth of screen time, in the end it is Helene's anguish and turmoil that provides the only real emotional connection within the film.

I was disappointed with the film's rather stereotypical portrayal of Japan as the Inscrutable Orient. The village headman is kindness and generosity itself until he (inevitably, inexplicably) turns on Herve. The nameless women are presented as subservient to the point of mutability; the headman's concubine disappears into the onsen waters as though her existence were nothing more than a wisp of smoke. Japanese women here are basically reduced to sexual objects, so much so the only one permitted to speak is a prostitute, plying her trade in France. Incredibly disappointing.

Overall, 'Silk' is a beautiful looking film that is seriously hampered with issues of pacing and a lead actor who couldn't act his way out of a mime's imaginary box. Devotees of landscapes, cinematography, or Keira Knightley might get something out of it, but for the general populace - do yourself a favour and just read the book (it'll take less time).",1229212800,13,4356,5.059888579387187
3280883,2,B00104J4IO,"Well, I just finished watching Silk, and all I can think about is the hour and a half of my life I'll never get back...The scenery in this movie is a feast for the eyes, and the only pro as the dull and lifeless script made me fast-forward through most of the movie. I found the characters to be very underdeveloped, as well as the plot; specifically I had issue when Michael Pitt's character Herve develops an fixation with a Japanese concubine, which is a major reason why he makes repeated trips back to Japan (the backbone of the movie), seems very unfounded; the two have very little screen time and no dialogue, yet an ""obsession"" blooms. If you love historical fiction as I do, I recommend something more satisfying... like the English Patient, Zelery, Pride & Prejudice",1222992000,2,777,4.63768115942029
3280884,5,B00104J4IO,"This is a cinematic masterpiece -- the music, the scenery, the absolutely perfectly choreographed interactions of the characters (themselves beautiful and unpretentious in their portrayals)...the subtext is rich and multi-layered -- we are given an opportunity to see how desire, in its many forms, affects individuals and others around them -- how it informs and how it inspires and at times, controls us obsessively, even blinding us from the realities that are before us -- for many reasons. If you're patient, attentive, and open to the nuances that abound, this is a rewarding, rich film that is at times brutally candid and at others, dreamily opulent with wonder. One of my new favorites...I was captivated until the last note of the soundtrack was played.",1219881600,2,763,5.161290322580645
3280885,4,B00104J4IO,"I read the novel `Silk' by Alessandro Baricco and loved it. Therefore, I was rather wary of seeing the adaptation. But when I saw the film, I was not disappointed; the visual imagery is beautiful and the Japanese symbolism was well-related.

The location of the story is France in 1862. Herve (Michael Pitt) is convinced by Baldabiou (Alfred Molina) to travel in search of silkworm eggs in order to save the silk-making business. Herve travels to Africa and Japan. During his trip to Japan, he falls in love with a Japanese concubine. When he returns home to France, he cannot forget the Japanese beauty and continues to obsessively long for her.

The untranslated Japanese conversations allows the audience to relate to the main character, as he too does not understand the language. Keira Knightly made a wonderful `Hlne' but I wasn't convinced by Michael Pitt as the main character `Herv Joncour'; the obsessive inner turmoil wasn't portrayed well on screen. Overall, however, I think the film is well-worth seeing.",1215561600,,1018,5.017751479289941
3280886,1,B00104J4IO,"Like many well-intentioned adaptations, ""Silk"" fails in its horrible execution.  We supposedly have an adventurous silk trader, Herve Joncour (Michael Pitt), who undertakes the perilous journey from France to Japan in the mid-1800s in search of blight-free silkworm eggs that would ensure his village's prosperity in the silk industry.  Married to a fetching wife and, from all accounts, in love with her, our intrepid traveler becomes obsessed with a Japanese concubine in his first trek to Yamagata.  On the pretext that Japan's silkworm eggs are worth the frequent traveler miles, Herve returns to Japan to obtain yet another glimpse of his amour.  We are obliged to accept that the largely lethargic Pitt traverses these thousands of miles (3 times!) by carriage, rail, ship, caravan and horseback, when it looks like he can't even get across town without being toppled by a strong breeze.  Straining to evoke a Dr. Zhivago-like epic, it only succeeds at looking ludicrous.  Permanently sporting a pout like a child scolded for playing with worms, Pitt mumbles in a monotone with one wooden facial expression all throughout, in perfect accompaniment to his sleep-deprived droning voiceover narration for the film's painful 110 minutes.  As badly miscast and as anemic as Pitt's acting is, it is equaled, agonizingly enough, by the same lifeless performance of Keira Knightley as Herve's wife Helene.  Mostly relegated to bidding Herve a spiritless goodbye whenever he departs and a spiritless hello whenever he returns, one wonders if the absence of affect and chemistry with the two was a joke on the audience that they secretly delighted in.

It may have been possible to forgive such lackluster acting if there was a story to behold.  When the procurement of silkworm eggs is more riveting than Herve's infatuation with the unnamed concubine, then I know there's no redemption.  I am as perplexed as those who've seen director Francois Girard's ""Red Violin"" in the `90s, a magnificent film that remains one of my favorites to this day.  A feudal Japan of the 1800s, still closed to the west, with its warring warlords and bewildering culture would have been ripe for exposition, injecting the much-needed tensions and conflicts the film sorely lacks.  To not have attempted to incorporate it in any meaningful way with the lame love story was a fatal mistake.  At least, it could have given the dying plot a fighting chance.  This is nothing more than another dull and dreary depiction of the white man's fantasy of the submissive, exotic female, a stereotype that really is getting old.

I'm no stranger to arthouse, but honestly, it's films like this that give arthouse a bad reputation.  The fantastic cinematography in ""Silk,"" with breathtaking panoramic shots of Japan in winter, cannot rescue this inferior film.  I've seen nature documentaries on PBS with more gist and drama than this turgid exercise.  Come to think of it, I've seen turtles with more passion.",1213833600,39,2975,5.109504132231405

I am so glad that I did not return it! Silk is a visual masterpiece about a mayors son named Herve who falls in love with a beautiful young women named helene. Every thing seems like It's going to be picture perfect about that time a man named Baldabiou has ideas of opening the run-down silk mill the only problem is there is a disease killing all the silk eggs in france and without the eggs there can be no silk mill. Baldabiou approaches Herve and tells him about going to Africa to retrive the eggs Herve accepts. Helene does not want Herve to leave there are recently married but she does not want to be a burden. After succesfully retriving the eggs Herve must go on another journey to japan. Some of the eggs are dead and Baldabiou sees that as a very bad sign. Leaving his wife again he sets out on a tough journey and falls in love with the mistress of a powerful japanese baron. Herve ends up going again and becoming more obsessed with her and at one point after finding a note saying ""come back or I shall die"". while Helene is at home lonely and waiting for Herve ( How sad!)
Pros: Silk is very beautiful visualy! great cineamatography. Lovely Costumes. And a beautiful score that should have won an oscar. Another Great thing about the film was Keira Knightley as Helene. She was so beautiful in her costumes and her performance was very touching and very subtle yet heart breaking!
Cons: Michael Pitt is not as good Keira Knightley and pouts and tries to act cute. Other then that.....................................
Rating: 8.5/10 Silk is a love story about a man who forget the love of his life was always been near and not far. It's beautiful to watch but Michael pitt almost makes it less than great But Keira Knightley makes up for that she was awesome!",1213401600,2,1931,4.396648044692737
3280889,1,B00104J4IO,"This was a beautiful movie.  The sets were fantastic, the scenery was moving.  It was, in fact, the only movement whatsoever in the entire production.

This movie was painful.  Really, really painful.  Nothing of any consequence happened... or seemed to.  The story was all in the background, a context through which the characters altogether failed to move.  Keira Knightly is breathtaking, but she and Alfred Molina portray the only two characters who seem to have any life to them whatsoever.  She was really only in a few scenes, nowhere near enough to redeem this production.  The main character was sodden, gloomy, and altogether uninteresting.  The best single word to describe him would be ""pathetic"" if only there were some pathos, some connection between him and the viewer.  Sadly, that connection so spectacularly fails to develop that, when I found that I had missed a line of muttered or mumbled dialog (the majority of the plot is conveyed via a sort of moaning, whispered narrative voice over) I found that I really did not care.

SILK is certainly a change of pace from the many movies loaded with violence and dripping with message.

3280891,2,B00104J4IO,"Based on the prose-poem novel by Alessandro Baricco, director Francois Girard's `Silk' excruciates its audience by trying way too hard to be a beautiful genre film complete with spectacularly photographed vistas of France and Japan, profoundly symphonic music and the kind of pretty crinoline-d costumes in which most bodice-ripping aficionados would want to be corseted.  However attractive, `Silk' wears thin right from the get-go.

Michael Pitt, severely miscast as Herve Joncour (why not James McAvoy?), plays this 19th century purveyor of silk eggs--a supposed intrepid adventurer traveling from Lyon to Africa and Japan--with a spectrum of emotions limited to a flat line expression of distracted cherub-faced banality.  Does anything faze this person?  Is his cravat tied too tightly?  Not really--Pitt spends most of the movie in kimono, so he's definitely comfortable.  Nevertheless, when Herve experiences sensual exquisiteness--be it women (two lusciously yet polarly different beauties--the fair Helene (Keira Knightly) and the nameless dark and sultry Japanese concubine (Sei Ashina) or nature--- he flitters through a pastel flower-strewn rendition of Monet's France (Girard's scene at the beach captures in essence the painting ""La Promenade, la Femme a l'Ombrelle"") and meanders through a misty art house imagining of rural Japan that suggests the fragile Haiku tension of ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", he pouts with the one-note prissiness that stamps him as a graduate in fine standing from the quintessential ""you'll-never-understand-me"" school of teen television drama, ""Dawson's Creek. With blue-green eyes that are quick to water - his only visual sign of emotion, other than a slackness of his full lips--he stumbles through 20 years of his life on a confused quest for his idea of perfection.  Ironically, Helene, his wife, waits at home for the garden and child she has promised herself while he pants over his conceptualization of a woman with whom he has never spoken with the persistence and deadened optimism of a voyeur clicking through mega-sites of Internet porn.

So what's it all about and is it worth two hours of the viewer's time?  No.  Even for die-hard Knightly fans, `Silk' offers scant opportunity for this actress to really hone her craft and shine in any way other than that of a lovely accoutrement to an already lovely backdrop.  She spends most of her screen time in a languorous pre-`Atonement' wait state-- I have come to think of this film as an exercise to her more intense character of Cecelia opposite James McAvoy in `Atonement.'  There, too, her angular body is positioned in an ultimate welcoming or goodbye posture.  Here, she is less bitter, her jaw still clenched while her arms remain outstretched ready to grab her errant husband to her bosom each and every time he returns from his trek for eggs.  Sadly, unfulfilled in her inability to conceive a child or understand her husband's restlessness--of this I conjecture, as the plot of the film reveals little of the underpinnings of her mind--she conveys an overall feeling of the unessential role women, in general, portrayed in life then and perhaps, even in life today.

And just how are women depicted?  If we enjoy a football game, we are inundated with glimpses of cheerleader's legs, breasts and swatches of long hair swaying.  If we like cars or cameras, well, there is always a model or two glad to sell you the latest technological advancement while allowing a glimpse or two of their corporeal delicatessens.  It comes as no surprise that there are certain women who sell their sexuality to make their way in a world that has been designed by men. Are we to believe that that is the only alternative?  In `Silk,' a film intended to be appealingly romantic to women, we again are reminded that women hold a secondary role--the concubine does not speak, yet Herve is entranced--by what?  Her subservience?  Helene is fetching indeed, but as Herve doesn't seem to care, why should we?  All those poetic musings in the Baricco novel come off as the usual stereotypical drivel that reduces women to commodities rather than flesh and blood individuals with needs of their own.  Shame on you, M. Girard. I might as well watch the Speed Channel.

Bottom line?  Don't waste your time or your money on this one. The plot is boring. The actors wallow in self-pity.  Yes, the photography waxes aesthetic but you would do better with a picture book of exotic locales. The  music accentuates the maudlin nauseating character study of the insipid Herve, but I'd rather listen to something truly impassioned like Rachmaninoff.  Personally, I am tired of the mentality of depicting pretty women being flaunted as tidbits to make men's lives more comfortable, be it a Playboy spread or a tea ceremony.  Enough already.  I can deal with a little manipulation.  Just show me some strength.

I awarded this movie two stars, both of which go to Alfred Molina as Herve's boisterous boss man.  He is the only player that livened up the so-called action in this snore fest.  Not recommended.

3280892,4,B00104J4IO,"This film was actually good, and I expected the worst :)...

It's interesting to watch with somebody of the opposite sex that you don't know well. You could tell a few things about her afterwards, like: Does she like classical music? Does she feel anything when watching splendid landscapes? Is she intelligent enough to figure the story's twist near the end? (I wasn't even close) Does she like ""slow"" movies? Can she withstand a moderate dose of ""drama""? Can she feel Helene's plight?

The musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto was superb, but we shouldn't be surprised given director Franois Girard's last films.
The only character I really liked was Afred Molina's ""Baldabiou"".
He's an entrepreneur with flavour for life. Likeable, tough but sensitive. A ""father figure"" to ""Herve"", who sorely needs one with such a bore of a father!
Herve's attitude to life was a bit strange to me. My friend said something that's always been there: ""he never smiles"". True, he barely winces, never seems to be happy, just like drowsily fulfilling a desk job.
Schuyler was great in his small role. How a street smart adversary can become a restrained source of practical wisdom!
Madame Blanche is also a necessary small role, but that has the life experience Herve will always lack.
He surely got sympathy from smart strangers!
I didn't get involved in Ludovic Berbek's story, although it's there with the clear intention of moving us. I also thought all this story of ""marital unhappiness"", infertility and she crying as they made love was a bit contrived.
I will never like Keira, but at least she doesn't look like a ""tomboy beanpole"" (!) as she said on one interview. Which wouldn't be becoming for her ""modest wife"" role.
She's not as good as her Guinevere, but at least she does her rather plain role without showing off. She doesn't look anorexic like in other roles. Maybe she didn't endure wearing a corset like on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

The best review I read was ""Grady Harp from United States"". I think it deserves to be the one you read first.
Jae-Ha Kim from Amazon is a good critical take. But I'm glad I didn't read it before watching the film, as it speaks about a twist that should be left alone :)!

My favourite scene is when the local baron shows cold Herve the peaceful place he and his ancestors enjoy for watching nature and connecting with nature. And the one in the bathtub, very tender in a sexually restrained world.
I also wanted to ""have a garden"" after watching this, thou I content myself with some plants in the balcony :)!
And Japan shows itself like a harsh country, both geographically and with respect to the Japanese. An ancient land with rules hard to understand by any westerner.
I did like the fact that the Japanese dialogues weren't subtitled. Unlike ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" & even ""the last Samurai"" I think that made us feel a bit like it must have been.  The sort of ""Ostrananie"" experience that the Russian formalist extolled as ""Art"".",1210377600,,2971,4.727799227799228
3280893,5,B00104J4IO,"""Silk"" is by far, the best love story to be filmed thus far. Michael Pitt and Keira Knightley are fantastic. This film is a stunning adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's novel.

The question is, did she know of her husband's infidelities, half a world away? Or was he just deluding himself, believing that a Warlord's concubine would place herself in that much peril, by corresponding with him? These questions are answered, and more, so deftly and passionately, that it is difficult not to be moved by this film.

The story concerns the ""beginning"" of the Silk Trade with Japan, some years before it was to be made official. Herve' Joncours (Michael Pitt) is contracted to go to Japan, illegally, to procure silkworm eggs, for the manufacture of silk, which is becoming the height of fashion in Europe. His relationship with smugglers in Japan is becoming more of a draw for Herve' than the eggs. He meets a concubine of the local warlord, and his loyalties and love are tested, as he is drawn to this mysterious woman, who he cannot possibly have.

On his return to Europe, he finds it difficult to resume his marital ""duties"". It is by his own ingeniuity, that he is instrumental in keeping his village from starving, when the silk trade dies. He is haunted by a letter, written in Japanese, that is translated for him, but by whose hand? Why?

The casting was superb, as were the sets and settings. You are convincingly transported back to the mid-1800's. Michael Pitt and Keira Knightley are fast becoming accomplished actors. The period was correct, for Japan was just coming to grips with the ""modern era"", and the Samurai period was to end. ""Silk"" is a superb achievement.

Unfortunately once you move beyond the lush, sumptuous landscape and the hopelessly romantic soundtrack you come face to face with a slow, plodding storyline that even the most lovelorn amongst us would have trouble staying with.

Keira Knightley is the vision of loveliness her audience has come to expect but love interest Michael Pitt is way over his head, failing to display the emotional depth and angst required for this role.

3280895,1,B00104J4IO,"It is hard to believe a film that employs the acknowledged talents and charms of Ms. Knightly could manage to be as dull, trite and devoid of impetus as this disaster.

I mean, on the way back you could assume I suppose the eggs needed refrigeration, but other than that it's just plain silly.

In most cases of pretentious B-movie drivel, the presence of a lovely and talented actress such as Keira Knightly acts as a sort of consolation prize. No such luck: she somnambulates through this train wreck as though she herself finds it hard to accept that she is really a part of the fiasco.

The scene where she undresses for Herve makes her seem even more like more of a commodity or prostitute.  Notwithstanding, the only other major Asian female role was an expensive Japanese prostitute in Europe.  It seems to be some nostalgic tribute to the ways of the past.  Perhaps it would be less stereotypical and more insightful if the Asian characters had been better developed, like in Memoirs of a Geisha.  This movie was extremely slow--maybe we Americans don't have that kind of patience for this--and the undeveloped story required so much reading between the lines that I still don't totally get it.  I can understand this sort of media back in the early 1900s when Asian women were exotic dragon ladies and the like, but I thought we've gone much farther beyond that by now.
