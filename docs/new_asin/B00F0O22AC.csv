8611150,5,B00F0O22AC,"I love good documentary films for science and nature. This ""Rise of Animals"" is one of the best. The past 550 million years is the most important in the evolution history of animals. This film is very informative in the evolution of vertebrates and mammals.",1454889600,,257,4.733333333333333
8611151,5,B00F0O22AC,"I think I have all of David's DVDs.  If I see something I don't have, I buy it immediately.  One of my favorites at the top of the list is ""Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives""  So, when I put this second on my list, I am saying that this is one of the best most interesting projects David has done yet.  I LOVE this.  David always informs and not just entertains.  Now, his team includes the best of CGI and the perfect mix of graphic aids as you would expect.  In this video it is apparent that the Chinese also love David's shows and had opened their doors to David and his cameramen.  So, we are treated to a rare tour of China and their discoveries [and there are many] and I am sure you will be impressed too.  Buy this one, you won't regret it.",1436572800,5,743,4.068965517241379
