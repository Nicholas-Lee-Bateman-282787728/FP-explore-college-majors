7860708,4,6304083394,"This excellent video of two interesting comedies, made in 1920 and 1916 respectively, show that Douglas Fairbanks was a brilliant comedy actor in the years prior to his most successful 'swashbuckling' adventure films of the 1920s.  Although there is no such glamour, action and fancy costume in these earlier films, they are not to be sneezed at.  Both these films, along with another two films on the companion Kino Video, ""The Nut/The Matrimaniac"", are intelligent, fast-paced, action-packed and entertaining comedies with good and interesting plots.  For example:
'The Mollycoddle' is Douglas Fairbanks as you've never seen him before:  a rich dandy from Monte Carlo with a monocle, cane and a silly walk who bungles along and falls in with a group of American travelers on their way back to Arizona.  Their tour guide, however, is in fact a diamond smuggler who uses tourism as a cover for his operation, and there is a clever little sequence of moving sketches, like cartoons, to quickly illustrate this in place of intertitles.  When the smuggler gets a tip-off that a Secret Service agent is onto him, he thinks it must be that clown, the Mollycoddle, and thus begins a very entertaining adventure, from being shanghaied in Monte Carlo to dancing with Hopi Indians in Arizona.
The second film is just under an hour long, but also packed with action and a certain suspense.  In this one, our reluctant hero is an artist with no money, broken-hearted and so down on his luck that even a suicide attempt fails, so he hires a professional killer called Automatic Joe to end it for him.  Right then, his luck suddenly changes:  he inherits a fortune and he gets his girl back...but Automatic Joe could be  around the next corner!
These films have been digitally remastered from original prints and are in top condition, adding to one's viewing pleasure.  I highly recommend either or both these Kino video tapes, regardless of whether or not you like the more famous Fairbanks films.",1082851200,,1985,4.913173652694611
