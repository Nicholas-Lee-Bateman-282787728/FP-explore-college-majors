8119668,3,B000FA57VM,Would have been 4 stars if it wasn't only 3 episodes.,1165104000,,53,3.909090909090909
8119669,4,B000FA57VM,"I really enjoy the series.  But who's idea was it to put the second series special editions in tins?!  They are virtually impossible to get the DVD out.  The potential for some to crack the disk is too great.  And the tins take up twice the space as a normal clam shell dvd box.  The makers may think it is cool as a collectable, but I think it is really annoying.  Keep with the clam shell covers!",1161388800,,398,4.103896103896104
8119670,5,B000FA57VM,"The entire GITS universe, whether it be the original manga, motion pictures, or the adapted TV series, are all heavily philosophical so I'm not sure why the last reviewer bothers to complain.  These next episodes set up the confrontations later with Kuze to illustrate his true intentions as a radical reformist but needs the cover of a terrorist to strike fear into the government.  The episodes are consistent, driven, and well acted so I can't see giving this less than five stars.  If you're not able to unweave the philosophical web of dialogue that GITS (or The Matrix) lays before you then I suggest you find a brainless action film that the general public is used to having explained for them...you'll only get frustrated with this kind of complicated thinking.",1154822400,7,769,4.9
8119671,4,B000FA57VM,"I was kind of annoyed this box set only included episodes 21, 22, and 23. Then I found out, Volume 07 will include the last 4 episodes of this series. So we are getting pretty close to the end, which is unfortunate for fans of the series.

Regardless, with the limited edition version, you get the usual 2 Disc DVDs (Disc 1-DD audio, Disc 2-DTS audio) and this time around we get the following 2 figurines; Tachikoma (Vulcan Type) & President and Maid (Secret).

I haven't viewed the 3 episodes yet, which include 21-'Embarrasment', 22-'Reversal', 23-'Martial Law'. I'm still waiting for a new widescreen HDTV display to view it on. However, based on the rest of the series which I've thoroughly enjoyed, I am counting on more of the same top notch production values with the usual solid storyline.

There are already rumors of a 3rd GIG series coming out in Japan this winter...keep your fingers crossed.

Meanwhile, in the here and now, this is easily the best anime drama series out there. If you still haven't watched this series, I strongly urge you to give it a try. Nothing comes close to the maturity found in this adult storyline/plot. You have to go back to the original Ghost in the Shell movie or even AKIRA for this kind of production value in an anime.",1154649600,12,1266,4.613333333333333
8119672,3,B000FA57VM,"As Volume 6 opens Batou finds himself pursuing and confronting Kuze by himself in an attempt to capture him and the plutonium he just recieved. But did he really get the plutonium or was he cheated in the deal? What does it matter, because the Japanese government cannot ignore the threat and take a chance. Kuze plans to use the plutonium to arm a bomb with which the refugees can blackmail the government for their independence. Even if it's a fake, Gohda will still be able to use the situation to start a war against the refugees. The Major and Section 9 must find some way to tie in the nuclear device to Gohda and CIS unless they want to be the fall guy like in the first season.

You would think the last episodes of a show would be the best, but this sixth volume of 2nd Gig suffers a bit from a talking head disease which had been kept relatively in check for most of the season. You could have just taped the audio and listened to it and got the same experience as watching. It's like three episodes of Keanu Reeves' conversation with the designer of the Matrix in Reloaded in which you only comprehend about 20% if what is said. With only one more volume to go, hopefully the final episodes will be a return to form for this show. The only interesting bit from these episodes is that Motoko is beginning to understand that Kuze is someone she knew in the past. Someone that was very close to her. The origami birds that Kuze leaves behind are clues.",1154476800,3,1460,4.347985347985348
