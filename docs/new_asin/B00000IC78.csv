1220661,4,B00000IC78,"Campy fun from simpler days, this movie is a real treat.",1029456000,3,56,4.181818181818182
1220662,1,B00000IC78,"This is a fascinating movie. Not so much for what it is, as for what it represents: storytelling apathy. Ed Wood told nigh-unwatchably
ridiculous tales, but with conviction and from the heart. This, on the other hand...
 Look, I have never been lucky(?) enough to see the worst Larry Buchanan efforts (the sneaker-clad monsters, the typos in the title cards), but this movie helps me to understand MST3K's popular host segment where it was hypothesized that the moviemakers just must not have cared
 Similarly, GU doesn't have plot holes- it has canyons. Did no one involved with the movie notice that the title character rises from suspended animation AFTER several killings have already taken place? The characters may be excused for believing him responsible, because they did not see him rise, but the audience had, and therefore knows he has an airtight alibi: he was still dead. Yet no explanation is given or even attempted. Wassupwitdat?
 This had possibilities. Limited possibilities, I'll admit, but the capacity was there to be a diverting, if silly, little 50's sci-fi opus. However, any possibilities GU had were snuffed out. I can forgive executional gaffes or shortcomings due to budget, bad acting or weak effects. I'll even forgive junk science sometimes in the name of fun, nostalgia or imagination. But flaws this grievous at the script level are fingernails-on-a-chalkboard to me. Badness of this kind is not the lovable, comical ineptitude of Hideous Sun Demon; it's just annoying.
 Only when mistakes so moronic pop up do I turn a more critical eye to these dumb little films, and set out to find all the mistakes I can. What would be a charmingly naive plot point in a slightly better film is unmasked as the ugly prom date it is. Such as: The Giant takes bullet after bullet to his person, with little effect, then is defeated very suddenly due to his own clumsiness. How can this dubious denoument make any sense given the tall fellow's supposed indestructibility? Because the script says it must, and the moviemakers would have had to pay the crew more to wait around while a suitable ending was rewritten. Or that's my guess, if anybody gave it even that much thought.
 The half-hearted moviemaking style is demonstrated in other ways. Cunha provides some evidence that he knew how to make Giant of the Unknown technically better; but he seemed not to care.
 Take for example, the scene where the stereotyped ""crazy Indian"" character sneaks up on the scientist. The Indian carries a rifle and there is still doubt whether he is behind the earlier killings. Where other directors would have built suspense by establishing both characters in their spatial relationship to each other, then cutting back and forth between them in a succession of tighter shots, Cunha finds contentment in showing one wide shot, then cutting to the oblivious scientist and building the music to crescendo, without seeing anymore of the peril. The viewer feels doubly cheated- tension is hinted at, then never mounts. Because it would've meant utilizing different angles, which would take tearing down the camera and setting it up again, a longer shooting schedule...
 And there a lot of dumb things in this movie, but I won't take the time to outline any more.
 ... Sigh ...
 GU is the kind of sci-fi/horror movie I really enjoy (and hate when it is messed up): a small, isolated community overcomes squabbling and joins together to fight off a monster. But a 6-foot-6 guy just isn't that horrifying, 500 years old or not. And let's face it, there a dozen better efforts out there, even when you are as manic as I am and divide them into sub-sub-subgenres. Yet though there are a lot of these movies, there aren't so many that there isn't always room for one more *good* one. Therefore, I can imagine myself as a 10-year old in 1958, crying as I left the theater because, well, a Saturday afternoon monster movie matinee is a terrible thing to waste.
 ... Sigh ...

The characters are interesting to watch(especially nosy Sheriff Parker)and although the story sounds stupid, somehow it all seems to work. I think I've watched this DVD more than any other.

He also played the giant in Abbott and Costello's Jack and the Beanstalk. Any film made in this era, either sci-fi or horror can only be deservedly called a classic. Giant from the Unkown is no exception.

1220734,4,B00000IC78,"Minor Spoilers abound below but what the heck  its unlikely that knowing any of this will change your viewing experience.  Besides, I bet many looking at this review saw the film as a kid on late shows. (I saw this in 1962 in Saratoga Springs, NY on WTENs Weirdo Late Show)  Also the below paragraphs DON'T reveal the ending or what ultimately happens to any main characters.

--- SPOILERS----

Are there plot holes? Hows this:  Several ghastly murders and animal attacks happen BEFORE the title character resurrects.  Actually, someone else could have done the deeds (and theres at least one character with some real issues) but thats never fully explored within the story.

Are there extreme leaps in logic?: Well  Theyre looking for a huge Spanish soldier that died over 500 years ago. It seems that the soil and leaves have some sort of preserving properties. This prompts one person to quip, Oh no  ""You don't suppose he could STILL be ALIVE!!""
  There is actually a pretty imaginative part in the film where a map is hand drawn by one character showing the entire search area. Then, during the search, a while line image of the map is superimposed over the film showing grids disappearing as search areas are covered. Looks pretty cool and innovative.

Are there continuity issues: How bout near the climax where one second its snowing and theres snow on the ground, then suddenly theres no snow falling OR on the ground. And how about this going back and forth several times.

Low budget Issues?  My picks the romantic scene where the guy and gal are enjoying a sweet moment in front of a lovely slightly rippling lake. Only problem id the ripples aren't moving because they're actually standing in FRONT OF A PICTURE of a lake!

Revealing Issues: Maybe when the giant picks up a guy whos attached to several hoisting wires.

Over the top implausibility: I suppose the entire film might fit here, but how about the fact that this well preserved monster is only buried deep enough to be mostly covered by leaves. In fact you can see his eyes when they open. But to be fair, a creepy living hand reaching up through the leaves is ALWAYS enough to keep a kids head under the covers for at least a few nights!

---NO MORE SPOILERS ----

Now - is it entertaining?  Very much so! Just remember, this is a 50s Drive-in style thriller and watch it in that spirit. It is fondly remembered by many who, as kids, begged their parents (or in my case grandparents) to Let me stay up and see the MONSTER movie!  Oh what fun those nights were.

One more thing  I bought this movie some 5 or 6 years ago and I was almost shocked at how pristine the film looked. Its sharp and very clean. Audio is fine too.  The video image is a clear 5 stars. So don't be afraid of a 2 star Public domain look. This movie looks awesome. I bought the one with the pictured cover art. It could only look better on a blu-ray.",1455667200,2,2897,4.505747126436781

1220742,3,B00000IC78,"Giant From The Unknown is a standard classic in my collection in that I have watched it nearly a dozen times since purchasing the DVD. I like most of my generation grew up on these B-movies almost second hand through late night television shows with strange horror hosts who poked harmless fun at the pictures but really taught us to embrace the classic films usually ignored by big box office standard studios. That feeling of nostalgia is why I still turn to these films as an almost ""comfort food"" for the soul.

This film although rattled with the faux pas of most classic B-movies in that there is a basic male chauvinism and xenophobia subtext to the story is a fun and light sci-fi flick for all ages. It is just how film and television flowed in those days. Push it aside and Giant From The Unknown like a lot of old movies is really a great story that is both entertaining and filled with adventure. Especially when dealing with the 50's sci-fi genre.

This movie has a pretty interesting and fantastical story that deals with real giants of historical legends which just sets the mind to wonder. The dialog and acting is classic melodrama which is slightly over-the-top but fun to watch. The Giant is pretty intimidating and unlike most movie monsters of the era he looks convincing realistic. Over all the film is a great way to introduce kids to the old black & white genre stuff and a film that hold's it's own against any giant lizard or mummy.

I saw no reason to rip it to shreds as one reviewer so painstakingly did. Richard E.Cunha made some bad horror films but this isn't the worst I've seen. It sports fairly decent location shooting for one thing and some of the most unintentionally funny dialogue and situations you could want in a low budget ""monster"" movie. The ""Giant"" of the title isn't really a monster but a revived Spanish Conquistador who's just really big, really dirty and mad as hell. Held responsible for murders and other assorted mayhem that occured BEFORE he was revived (as the above mentioned reviewer correctly noted), he commences his rampage by stomping around with an axe. There's an elderly archaeologist, his chirpy daughter, a jerk sheriff and the hero---a local guy who keeps getting blamed for everything by the sheriff. The story takes place in a mountain community where everyone is upset by these brutal murders---yet one young woman is left ALONE by her brother in their remote cabin and meets the ""Giant"" when she goes to the well for water. Then the dippy heroine is left alone at a campsite I don't know how many times while the men go off in the mountains. Yep, the ""Giant""s lurking around in the bushes. He also throws rocks at people. So you see, this is a goofy, goofy film. It's dumb and silly but I liked it because it's really watchable.

7909913,3,B00000IC78,"There are some mighty strange things happening around Pine Ridge.  The local yokels get together to discuss the latest outrage, the death of Harold Banks.  Poor Harold was killed offscreen in the same manner as the neighborhood sheep and cattle.  Everything from a crusty old legend to the supernatural is blamed.  As luck would have it, the local sheriff (Bob Steele as Nosy Parker), is willing to blame anything that moves but sets his sights on local geologist Wayne (Ed Kemmer).  Hes too smart for his own good!  Sadly, the sheriff is also the village idiot.  That man has a badge instead of a brain.  Wayne joins forces with a visiting scientist (Morris Ankrum) and his lovely daughter Janet (Sally Fraser).  They plan to discover the whereabouts of the Diablo Giant.  And they do, with mixed results.  Naturally, the idiot sheriff compounds one glaring mistake after another.  He also indiscriminately shoots at anything he pleases, and it pleases him greatly to shoot at Wayne.

Not much in the way of a horror movie or a creature feature.  The giant shows up late and isn't nearly as impressive as the moniker suggests.  Hes only six feet tall, if hes an inch.  In Conquistador armor he looks even smaller.  But he has an axe to grind!

7909916,4,B00000IC78,"I'm quite a fan of 50s sci fi, and it's always fun to find one you haven't already seen.  This one sort of captured my heart.  From the first scene, and despite the weak acting of some of the minor characters we're initially introduced to, I found myself drawn into the lives of the people, the story, and the community where all the strange goings on are, well, going on.  The four main non-monster characters are likeable (even the sheriff, in his own abrasive way, has some appeal) and do a believable job in their parts.  I was surprised how well this low budget film was shot, and especially, how good the musical score was.  It was fun to see aging actor Morris Ankrum, as good and as likeable as ever in the part of a scientest who sets out to prove the existence of a historical figure, and winds up meeting up with him, face to face.  Morris appeared in at least six other classic sci fi flicks in the latter years of his career, including Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, Flight to Mars, Invaders from Mars, and Rocketship XM.

Giant from the Unknown isn't a sci fi gem like some other 50s classics.  It isn't an epic story like This Island Earth and lacks the special effects of War of the Worlds.  Even so, when seen through the lens of the era when it was made, it's surprisingly watchable and enjoyable because of the people in it.  It's theatrical ""comfort food,"" like a bowl of chicken noodle soup on a cold day.  Curl up with a bowl of Campbells and watch it sometime!",1472256000,,1482,4.352727272727273
