6964927,5,B00S8XJJP8,The movie had powerful characters who were facing new ways of living after WWII. The mystery of Nelly and Johnny's relationship keeps you wondering right to the final scene. Excellent film - hope that it will have a USA DVD version produced.,1442102400,3,241,4.761904761904762
6964928,4,B00S8XJJP8,"Nina Hoss (`Barbara' and `A Most Wanted Man') plays Nelly, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp. She has been disfigured and has to undergo plastic surgery. She forgoes having a new face as she wants to be reunited with her husband. This is Jonny an erstwhile piano player who she has not seen since her arrest over a year before.

Her best friend Lene is helping her in the hopes that they can leave for Israel and escape persecution. However Nelly is determined to be reunited and starts the search of Berlins, less than glamorous, night spots.

This is a story of enduring love and loss, it is acted superbly - Hoss is as ever excellent but so is her foil in Husband Ronald Zehrfeld who was also in `Barbara' who plays the role without subtlety until it is needed in a performance that is as straightforward as it is understated.  Period detail is spot on and the sub titles are really good. It is beautifully shot too and has a feeling of disquiet throughout - this is not a feel good movie by a long chalk. It is though one that flits by, I was surprised when it ended as I was still up for more and as such is one I can easily recommend.",1442016000,3,1145,4.267281105990784

6964930,5,B00S8XJJP8,"I've seen hundreds of holocaust films in my day, and honestly didn't know if I could see any more. But this little masterpiece knocked me off my feet! First of all, it's not your typical holocaust film - it's storyline has more to do with deception, false hope and coming to the devastating realization that you don't really know the person you thought you understood and loved most in in the world. It's a universal story about coming to grips with the shattering reality of the unthinkable. I loved this film!",1441238400,12,511,4.626373626373627
6964931,4,B00S8XJJP8,"""Phoenix"" (2014 release from Germany; 98 min.) brings the story of Nelly (played by Nona Hoss). As  the movie opens, we see a badly injured Nelly being driven to the hospital for facial reconstruction. Upon entering Berlin's American Zone, the US guard forces Nelly to remove the bandage, which she does, to the belated horror of the guard. After the facial reconstruction (or ""re-creation"" as her friend Lene calls it), Nelly only has a fleeting resemblance of her old self. Eventually Nelly goes looking for her husband Johnny. When she locates him, he does not recognize her, but instead he asks her to pretend to be Nelly, so as to be able to claim Nelly's family inheritance. At this time we are 15 min, into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from German director Christian Petzhold, who previously has brought masterpieces like Barbara, Yerichow, Yella (all of which also star Nina Hoss), The State I Am In, and Gespenster. Petzhold is in my opinion one of Europe's most important and best directors, period. ""Phoenix"" touches many aspects: there is the immediate aftermath of WWII, and the enormous scars (physical, mental, and other) incurred by the Jewish people who managed to somehow survive; then there is the psychological mind games played by both Johnny and Nelly (did Johnny betray Nelly during the war? is Nelly betraying Johnny now?). It all plays out brilliantly. Check out the movie's final scene (no worries, I won't spoil), which stunned me and everyone else in the theater. Nina Hoss, in her 4th collaboration with Petzhold, brings another daring and touching performance as the shattered and brittle Nelly. Wow, just wow.

Even though this movie is a year old, it just now found its way to my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Better later than never, I suppose. I couldn't wait to see ""Phoenix"". The matinee screening where I saw this at this weekend was PACKED, somewhat to my surprise and delight. If you like a top-notch quality foreign movie that will stay with you long after you've seen it, you cannot go wrong with this, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Phoenix"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1440892800,23,2312,4.862944162436548

6964935,5,B00S8XJJP8,"Set in Berlin right after WWII, Nelly, a German-Jewish woman whose face had been shattered undergoes reconstructive surgery.  When the surgeon asks her who she'd like to look like, offering some popular stars, Nelly insists that she wants her old face back.

This wasn't possible and although her new face is very pretty she suffers from a loss of identity.  She feels like she doesn't exist.  Her friend is arranging for their passage to Palestine, (Israel didn't exist at the time) and tries to enlist Nelly's interest in choosing an apartment and making plans for a new life there.  But Nelly wants her old life, just as she wants her old face.  She is obsessed with finding Johnny, her husband, the pianist with whom she sang at a club called Phoenix. Thoughts of Johnny are what kept Nelly alive during her internment in Auschwitz.  Indeed she is the only member of her family who survived.  The club miraculously still exists and Johnny is there, but now is forced to bus tables and lives in a miserable room..  She calls out to him but he, seeing just her new face, doesn't recognize her.  However the resemblance to Nelly is close enough so that he hatches a plan to convince her to pretend to be Nelly so that he can inherit her sizable estate.  She agrees and moves in with Johnny as he coaches her to dress and act like Nelly.  Despite the bizarre arrangement she feels that she is now like herself again..

This begins a fascinating tale and we wonder at every moment what will happen.  Will Johnny recognize ""Esther"" (the name she gives him) as Nelly, will Nelly regain Johnny's love, in the form of Esther, will they be able to convince her former friends that she is Nelly, will the plot work, and
most importantly, is Nelly's friend's belief that Johnny betrayed her to the Nazis true.  Did he ever really love her?  What about the tatoo?  What's with the revolvers?

The two stars give impeccable performances.  Nina Hoss, as Nelly gets the most attention as her role is the most dramatic.  However Ronald Zehrfeld gives a beautifully complex performance as Johnny. Is he merely an opportunistic brute or does something of the presence of Esther awaken a true love that he once had for Nelly?  Watching him at the railway station where he has arranged the charade, the false presentation of Nelly to her friends, we see his former mask like face come alive  For a moment it seem that he really is meeting his long-lost love.  I won't spoil the ending for you but just want to say that's  probably the most electric, perfect climax I've ever seen to a film.

The symbol of the phoenix as death and rebirth is, of course, present as we see people and a whole nation, trying to rise from the ashes, but Petzold wisely doesn't hit us over the head with it.  The focus is on the human story and that is very much enough.

I highly recommend it.",1439683200,25,2856,4.549019607843137
6964936,4,B00S8XJJP8,"Our 2015 Seattle International Film Festival audience was pleasantly surprised by this award-winning story from Germany (English captions) about a Holocaust survivor who must endure facial reconstruction surgery after she is freed. This means her husband doesn't recognize her but wants to recruit her to pretend to be his deceased wife (!?) so he can inherit her family's money. Ya got that so far? It really is NOT confusing, except maybe to her...

Director Christian Petzold successfully brings us war-torn Berlin and wonderful performances from:
  * Nina Hoss as Nelly Lenz, cruelly hurt physically by the Nazis and broken hearted besides. She had been a cabaret singer (her husband accompanied her on the piano) and we hear bits and pieces of the 40s popular song Speak Low from the earliest scenes.
  * Nina Kunzendorf, whose Lene is determined to help Nelly recuperate. She wants to move her to Palestine (Israel isn't yet a country) for safekeeping.
  * Ronald Zehrfeld is the handsome Johnny (""Johannes""), toiling in a rubble-strewn nightclub watching for a chance to inherit his wife's money.

We meet others from her former social circle and try to remember which ones had marks on their photographs that identified them as Nazis. She's not sure who betrayed her.

We watch him teach her how to forge her own signature, style her own hair, tailor her own clothes, etc. It's obvious that he knew his wife very, very well and she finds that flattering, to the dismay of her friend Lene. I really liked that final scene.",1431648000,10,1529,4.94140625

6964942,4,B00S8XJJP8,"Possible spoilers.  This award-winning German film by Christian Petzold tells the story of a Holocaust survivor who returns to Berlin shortly after the war to reunite with her husband.  Nena Hoss plays Nelly Lenz, the survivor who is terribly disfigured with her head in heavy bandages.  We don't learn what caused the disfigurement but we know it was done by the Nazis.  Her friend, Lene (Nina Kunzendorf) is escorting her to a clinic to perform facial reconstruction surgery.  Again, we don't know much about Lenes background.  Apparently she escaped to London before she was arrested.  We are given a few hints that suggest that Lene might be attracted to Nelly as well.  One of the things that is interesting and confounding at the same time, is that Petzold (also did the screenplay) keeps the audience guessing much of the time, and is some instances, misleads.

After her surgery, Nelly complains she doesnt look the same.  Much to Lenes consternation, Nelly goes into the night searching for her husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld).  She finds him working as a busboy at a cabaret called Phoenix in the American Sector.  Nelly is cautious when approaching Johnny, remembering Lenes disapproval, based on the uncertainty of Johnnys implication in Nellys arrest earlier.  Johnny doesnt recognize Nelly but they strike up a conversation.

Johnny realizes that this stranger looks enough like his wife that with some makeup, clothing and coaching she could pass for his Nelly.  This section of the film is a bit of a head scratcher in that Johnny doesnt realize this is actually his wife.  But best, you just go with it.  Johnny creates a coming home scam whereby this new girl, who is going by the name of Edith, will convince everyone she is the real thing.  The pair will then split Nellys currently sequestered wealth.  Lenes sudden departure leaves Nelly with additional information about Johnny which leads to a terrific concluding scene.

This is transferred to a stunning Blu ray by Criterion.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Here is information provided by Criterion regarding the transfer:
This new digital transfer was created on an ARRISCAN film scanner in 2K resolution. The original 5.1 surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master files.

Transfer supervisor: nhb, Hamburg.
Colorist: Adam Ingis/Post Republic, Berlin.""

The transfer is perfect.  Excellent color and detail, even small objects are sharp and clear.  There are no issues with the picture.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is likewise excellent.  Other than a couple scenes at the Phoenix, the film is dialog centric and is easily understood.  The film comes in German with English subtitles, the only option.  Extras include a trailer, a 25 minute piece where Petzold and Hoss discuss the film and their previous collaborations (6), an interview with cinematographer, Hans Fromm, a making of short and a leaflet with an essay by film critic Michael Koresky.",1475452800,,3042,5.062374245472837

6964946,5,B00S8XJJP8,"The Phoenix of the title is the name of a Berlin club where, before World War 2, Nelly Lenz (Nina Hoss) and her pianist husband Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld) performed for the patrons.  Nelly is Jewish, and she has been betrayed to the Nazis, taken to a camp, and disfigured.  Johnny, a Gentile, has been left to get on with his life, and he has spent the war working in the club as a kind of handyman.  Nina has undergone reconstructive facial surgery after the war, in Switzerland, and when she has recovered, she comes back to Berlin to find Johnny.  She does not want to believe, as her friend and helper Lene (Nina Kunzendorf) does, that Johnny was her betrayer.  When she does find him, he doesn't recognize her, but he is drawn to her and he sees two opportunities for them: first, to make a musical career, and, more important to him, to have her pretend to be his wife (who has been assumed to be dead) and claim her inheritance.  Of course, she IS his wife, and he has no idea, as we and Lene do, of the extent of her suffering.

I won't give anything else away, except to say that Nelly strongly resists the idea that Johnny has betrayed her.  It's clear that she wants to believe him and love him, but she can't be certain about him or, more importantly, about herself in her new identity as ""Esther.""  Hoss is riveting as a woman struggling with her own identity after both trauma and physical change, and Zehrfeld is clearly drawn to her and yet senses a mystery about her.  Lene is instrumental in bringing about such resolution as there is, when it's clear that Nelly/Esther doesn't want to go with her to Israel and help establish the new state.  Christian Petzold directs fluidly, and the various different interiors fit the different moods and uncertainties, and we see enough of the ruins of Berlin to resonate with the reconstructed ruin that is Nelly.  Visually, there is an appropriate ""noir"" ambience to the whole thing, but it's at the service of something unusually dark here.  Hoss, Zehrfeld, and Petzold were all involved in the very different ""Barbara,"" but this is equally successful and more harrowing.",1471996800,2,2128,4.597883597883598

They thought that they were coming home and resume their lives. But the Germans disregarded them as if they were invisible. How to raise from the ashes?

6964985,5,B00S8XJJP8,"I used to watch foreign films all the time but got out of the habit in more recent years, except for one here or there. I had heard so many great things about this film that it was a logical choice for my next experience. I am glad I chose it as it is a perfect film. Although it is German, it reminds me somewhat of Truffaut's filming THE BRIDE WORE BLACK as part of his homage to the master, Hitchcock. That starred the incredible Jeanne Moreau. Nina Hoss in this film seems like a very worthy successor to Moreau.

The nightclub the leads worked at before the war and now after is named the Phoenix. But now the Phoenix is in the American sector of Germany since the war is recently over. Nelly, the protagonist, has been told that her husband betrayed her to the Nazis. She has recently been released from Auschwitz. She has also had extensive reconstructive surgery and looks only a little like her former self.

She finds her husband and that is where the movie really takes off. The Phoenix rises again and again, not just as a nightclub. For these two are recreating themselves constantly from the ashes and rubble too. The overriding question is what is behind this constant reinvention. What do one or both of them have to hide? Who is betraying whom?

I just read that this director is considered red hot and I notice there are quite a few other films to his name, almost all starring Hoss. I will be hunting these down as these are terrific talents.",1463875200,6,1461,4.4237918215613385

6964992,4,B00S8XJJP8,"It is rare to see a Holocaust film that portrays the lives of the victims. This movie does that, and it is done very well through a beautiful script, tender performances, inspired set design, and beautiful costumes. Nelly is a Jewish singer who is betrayed by her husband and handed over to the Nazis. She is beaten while in captivity at a concentration camp, but she survives her ordeal and tries to start her life over. She connects with her husband, but he doesn't recognize her. In a twist inspired by the movie Vertigo, the husband wants her to impersonate his wife, so he makes her up to be his wife, to try and inherit his wife's money.

The movie's final scene is masterfully done, and the director does a brilliant job of silently and slowly building suspense and tension throughout the film. I think everyone who loves foreign cinema should watch this movie.",1460764800,5,868,4.636363636363637

6964995,5,B00S8XJJP8,"What an interesting film! A Holocaust survivor returns to her home in Berlin hoping to reconnect with her husband. She has had facial reconstruction and her husband doesn't recognize her. He knows that his wife, whom he assumes has died along with the rest of her family, was the heir to a fortune but he cannot claim the money because he cannot prove that she is dead. The only hope of getting the money is for her to return and claim her inheritance. So he enlists the help of this woman who looks similar to his wife and offers to split the inheritance with her. That's the plot. How it plays out is riveting. I highly recommend this movie.",1458259200,3,643,4.411764705882353

6965014,5,B00S8XJJP8,"Even though I initially found the concept of Phoenix somewhat implausible (who wouldn't recognize their own wife?), I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief and to go along with the ride.  And the longer I watched the movie, the less skeptical I became and the more engrossed I was with the overarching themes of identity and perception.  Who am I? is the question at the center of this film and the director and actors address it in such a brilliant, emotional way.  Beautiful, sad, and darkly romantic, Phoenix forces its audience to examine their own identity and how it is shaped by the perception of others.  Definitely not for the Adam Sandler crowd, this film requires an emotional and intellectual commitment, but the payoff is well worth the investment.",1453766400,9,769,4.847328244274809

6965029,4,B00S8XJJP8,"Nina Hoss and Christian Peltzer have pulled off another double act, one as director of award winning films and the other as a woman as the agent of change in the rubble of post-war Berlin. In his previous two films with Hoss, Yella and Barbara, Peltzer has covered the split between east and west Germany, and crossing from one to the other side. This one deals with guilt ,redemption,identity and betrayal, in the reconstruction of a womans face and psychic renewal, as survivor of a concentration camp,come out of the land of the dead, who passes through a land of noirish shadows and deathly nights, to find out whether love exists or has been betrayed. Hosss bandaged up face shows Kelly barely exists for the 1st twenty minutes, like a pale,shadowy chimera,tentatively stepping forward out of a trauma beyond all conception. The films glory is in adumbrating this negative capability, into one of nebulous possibility. This recalls Eyes without a Face. The next part when she comes forth from the bandages,recalls Vertigo, in her mans attempt to model her into a likeness of his wife in order to gain her inheritance that hes not entitled to. Kunzendorf is great a tragic friend.

Germans have congregated in the Phoenix nightclub where American soldiers gather,casting off their own language, identities and songs, for the American ones on offer. Nelly goes to find her lost love and husband, Johnny( Zehrfeld). He sees a woman he could mould into a passing resemblance of his wife, so he has her live with him, and he shows Nellys old things like lip-stick, letters ,dress. Lene ( Kunzendorf) is Nellys
friend and wants to go with her to Haifa in Palestine. She knows Johnny betrayed her and divorced her on the day she was arrested, but Nellys love is strong at 1st as she gives Johnny a chance as they rehearse her role as Nelly, how she should act and behave. She knows Johnny is her husband, he seems blind of her being Nelly, until the Kurt Weill song she sings while all their friends are gathered. This film is dense with deep emotions of the guilt of Germans in post-war Germany, the remaking of Germany, the attitude of Germans to returning Jews, exploring the lives and emotions of Jews in post war Germany trying to reclaim their lost monies and contemplating where to spend their future lives. The films final scene is filled with such resonance and power before it fades. Masterly restraint in the telling,as if to echo Weills Speak Low. The period detail is meticulous, the cinematography to channel artifice out of trauma.",1451433600,4,2544,4.79498861047836

Oh, and he might have betrayed her to the Nazis. Absorbing and suspenseful, ""Phoenix"" raises memories of Hitchcocks ""Vertigo,"" with its haunted tone and themes of fantasy and identity.

I do have two minor complaints.  The plot suffers from what I call Agatha Christie Syndrome:  People who really ought to recognize someone, do not (or vice versa). And I don't understand why romantic mood-pieces like this one, which cry out for a musical score, eschew them.  Grade: B  grouchyeditor.com",1450483200,,653,5.171428571428572
