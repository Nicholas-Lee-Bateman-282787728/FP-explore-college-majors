3438527,5,B000USU9LC,"I'm not quite sure how anyone can give the Brady Bunch a 1 star rating like the one reviewer but so be it.

This is one of the campiest sitcoms ever but isn't that it's special quality? I mean how can you not love astroturf for lawn and windows without glass?

The Brady home was about the coolest home ever and if I were a millionaire I'd build one just like it and be stuck in the 70's.

This is Americana personified and will be known forever.

I can't wait until every season is on DVD and we'll have our eternal 70's forever.",1109116800,6,530,4.116504854368932
3438528,5,B000USU9LC,"First of all let me say one thing about the Brady Bunch...I always loved that house.  The spacious living and adjoining dining room, kitchen with the built-in oven, family room with patio, laundry room, den, heck even the attic.  I always wished I could have that house.  Well the Brady Bunch is surely one of the greatest pop culture icons of all time.  How funny is it that Sherwood Schwartz made this show AND Gilligan's Island.  Two shows that continue to live on in re-runs around the world when many other shows have faded to oblivion.

Was the Brady Bunch too perfect?  Perhaps sometimes.  Certainly they tried to do some slightly edgy storylines such as Greg getting caught smoking, but by and large this show celebrated family and family values that while maybe not quite realistic, it was still a joy to tune in and watch every Friday evening in the early 1970's.  For it's stars it became a blessing and a curse.  While some like Florence Henderson and Barry Williams embraced their roles and milked it for all they could, others, notably Eve Plumb retreated for many years and only recently seems to have come to grips with the importance of the show.

You know the plot...Two Divorcees, Mike Brady with 3 boys and CArol with 3 girls, get married and all live in the wonderful Brady house with Housekeeper Alice and dog Tiger.  Each week brought some new lesson for the kids to learn, but always one that could be figured out in 30 minutes.  It was this simplicity that has made the show so endearing to everyone but the most cynical.  Having grown up during that very period of time I can say I always thought the show did a fairly accurate job of portraying the times, even if it did ignore society's larger ills.  But so what?  What's wrong with escaping day-to-day problems for a bit and just being entertained and that's just what the Brady Bunch did.

My Favorite episodes from season one:

""Alice Doesn't Live here ANymore""  Alice feels she's not needed anymore and makes up a story about a sick Aunt in order to leave the Brady's.  But the kids put together a plan to get Alice to stay, making her know she's needed.

""A Camping we Will Go""  The boys camping trip is spoiled when the girls insist on coming along too.""

""Sorry, Right Number""  Mike is outraged at their phone bill and installs a payphone for the kids to use in the family room. But the plan backfires when he's forced to use it for an important business call.

""The Voice of Christmas"" Carol us supposed to sing in church on Christmas Day but comes down with laryngitus.  Cindy goes to the mall to see Santa and asks him to bring her Mommy's voice back.

""54 - 40 and Fight"" - The Brady kids have been collecting trading stamps for years and find out they are going out of business.  The boys and girls fight over who will get the stamps.  The boys want a rowboat and the girls want a sewing machine.  They battle by building a house of cards.

""Brace Yourself""  When Marcia has to get braces her date for a dance decides to break the date.  Marcia is convinced it's because she's ugly now.

""The Possible Dream"" - Carol mistakenly gives away Marcia's diary during a book drive much to the horror of Marcia.  Guest stars Desi Arnaz Jr.

""Lost Locket, Found Locket""  Jan receives a locket from a secret admirer and Alice teaches her something about being the middle child.

The Brady Bunch continues to be one of the most endearing shows in TV history and finally these are coming out on DVD.",1108944000,7,3477,4.49520766773163
3438529,5,B000USU9LC,"The Brady Bunch is a show that has certainly held up over the years.  Although some aspects of the show are dated, it is a show that you would definately have no problem letting your kids watch.  A bit unrealistic at times (Mike and Carol not having any arguements, one bathroom for nine people and no toilet in that bathroom, etc.), but a refreshing change of pace from a lot of today's shows.  When this show orginally aired on ABC on Friday nights, it was immediately followed by the Partridge Family, another show that defined the 70s.  The Partridge Family and the Brady Bunch were two shows that seemed to go hand in hand.  However, the Partridge Family has not been seen in syndication as much as the Brady Bunch has, and is even more dated than the Brady Bunch.  The Partridge Family should be released on DVD soon, so keep an eye out for that.  Also, another reviewer here stated that the Brady Bunch spin-off movie ""The Brady Girls Get Married"" aired on ABC in 1981.  That is incorrect.  It aired on NBC in 1981, followed by a short lived series called ""The Brady Brides"".  And in 1988, CBS aired ""A Very Brady Christmas"" and followed that with another short lived series called ""The Bradys"", a drama about the grown up Brady kids.  These were the only times (except for ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hour"" program aired in 1976-1977 by ABC) that the Bradys reunited to play their charcters in reunion shows.",1108771200,16,1413,4.545454545454546
3438530,5,B000USU9LC,"The Brady Bunch has been dismissed as kitsch...etc by too many tv critics. The plots are relatively simplistic, but the real charm of this 1969-1974 show is how it comforted my (and subsequent) generations. Remarriage (for whatever reason) was not the worst thing in the world.

The first season (1969-1970) has 24 episodes.

The pilot 'the wedding' is really nice. The wedding day shennanigans of Fluffy (the girls cat) and Tiger (the boys dog) do not prevent the ceremony from going on. Carol wears a then-traditional 'second marriage' non-white dress during the ceremony. Immediately after the pets crash the wedding ceremony, we see Mike (Robert Reed) and Carol (Florence Henderson) relating to all of the kids and dealing with all of the kids as being their own. This means that both parents loved all the Brady Bunch kids.

Even when Cindy's (Susan Olsen) Kitty Karyall later went missing (and Cindy drove everybody in the family nuts during the search process) this family sticks with each other.

Alice (Ann B. Davis) had lived with the Brady men, but also moves into the family. In ""Alice doesn't live here anymore"" she learns that she is an indispensable source of advice. With six active kids in this house, she is an indispensable source of wisdom and an extra eyes/ears/hands.

The Bradys face a mini-measles epidemic when all of the kids come down with this illness. The female doctor Carol calls is Marion Ross (who would later become famous as ""Mrs. C"" in the 1970's megahit ""Happy Days""). Mike also calls his own doctor (a man). Because I am among the generation of Americans who has never had measles, this episode was very interesting.

I really like how a running theme throughout this season is the family having to adjust itself to 'new faces' and their 'new habits'. Cindy has to decide which parent to invite to her school play in ""Eeenie, meenie, mommy, daddy"" and the Brady Kids negotiate their living space in ""A clubhouse is not a home""

All is worked out though because the kids eventually decide they like living together.

In ""To move or not to move"" the Brady kids pool their collective talents together to create 'ghosts' which scare prospective buyers away from their one-bathroom for six kids home. In future episodes/seasons we do not hear anything else about the attempt to move into a bigger home or the kids desire for more bathroom space.

More hijinks would follow in subsequent seasons.",1108684800,7,2428,4.85956416464891
3438531,5,B000USU9LC,"Wow, I am glad to see the Brady Bunch On DVD, as a child I watch the Brady Bunch and Save by the Bell in the afternoon, two awsome shows. The Brady Bunch always had a small adventure that the whole family was a part of, but being involve with family members in any activity is a cool experience then and today. I think that being apart, sharing, and growing up together makes families today, stronger! The Brady Bunch is a classic show with strong family values that we sometimes forget in our lives. Brady Bunch, great show for all ages and families to share togehter!!!",1108512000,4,571,4.39622641509434
3438532,5,B000USU9LC,"I grew up watching the Brady Bunch in repeats (every day @ 4:35 on TBS), now I watch it on TV Land. This is the best example of classic TV. Below is a description of every episode from season one that are on this DVD:

The Honeymoon (original air date: Sept. 26, 1969)

A Clubhouse Is Not a Home (original air date: Oct. 31, 1969)
Description: This episode should have been the first after the pilot because it shows everyone moving in together and often in syndication it is either dropped or it is put after the pilot. The family moves in together and the boys don't want to share their club house with their new sisters.

Kitty Karry-All is Missing (original air date: Nov. 7, 1969)

A-Camping We Will Go (original air date: Nov. 14, 1969)

Description: Yes, Florence Henderson can sing and this episode proves it. Carol loses her voice and rather than pray (that's not done on TV), Cindy asks Santa to lend a helping hand. Sure enough on Christmas morning Carol has her voice back in time to sing ""Oh Come All Ye Faithful"" for the entire congregation. By the way, this is anther episode that is rarely seen unless it's during Nick at Nite's or TV Land's Christmas specials.

Description: The day after Carol reads Mike's horoscope, which states ""a strange woman will enter your life tomorrow,"" Beebe Gillini enters Mike's office and proves to be a most difficult client.

3438533,5,B000USU9LC,"Sherwood Schwartz had a successful creation in 1964,that being the CBS sitcom Gilligan's Island. Five years later,he sold another creation of his to ABC called THE BRADY BUNCH. Here's the story of a man named Mike Brady(the late Robert Reed). Reed was a veteran of a TV medical drama called ""The Doctors"". Mike was a busy architect with three boys from his first marriage. Mike sons are named Greg(Barry Williams),Peter(Christopher Knight) and Bobby(Mike Lookinland). In the pilot episode,we see Mike marrying a widow named Carol(Florence Henderson). Carol has three daughters from her first marriage named Marcia(Maureen McCormick),Jan(Eve Plumb) and Cindy(Susan Olsen). Mike's family dog is a Briard named Tiger who sort of wrecks havoc at Mike's and Carol's wedding. Mike was a widower himself. After Mike and Carol are pronounced husband and wife,Cindy,Jan and Marcia become step-sisters to Peter,Greg and Bobby. This sitcom was quite influential on real-life blended families that formed since its premiere in 1969. It was ideal for this newly-formed family of eight to render the housekeeping services of a woman named Alice(Ann B. Davis). Carol certainly wouldn't and couldn't cook and clean all the time for the family. Davis appeared in the opening and closing montages in the extreme center. The montage looked like the cast were contestants on the Hollywood Squares. THE BRADY BUNCH was an immediate hit and although it only ran for five seasons,it spawned a few spinoffs(one of them was animated) and two theatrical films with Shelley Long and Gary Cole playing the roles of Carol and Mike. TBB also led to a recording contract for the minor cast members and them becoming teen idols. Also,TBB would later spin off a few made-for-TV movies aired by ABC. One of them is ""The Brady Girls Get Married"",which premiered in 1981. I dedicate this to the memory of Reed who succumbed to AIDS in 1992. Henderson,who's a singer also,would later become a spokeswoman for Wesson cooking oil. The relationship between Henderson and Wesson continues today. Davis had a cameo in the 1994 theatrical film,THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3:THE FINAL INSULT. The other cast members have kept low profiles since the demise of TBB in 1974. Some continued acting and others have not. Currently,cable television's TV Land frequently airs reruns of TBB.",1106611200,,2329,5.180371352785146

I assume you are aware of the show's premise and charm, so I won't bother with discussing merits of the show itself.  This very reasonably priced set suffers from uneven video imagery at times, which is its only drawback in my view.  While most of the time the video quality looks great -- incredibly sharp -- on my HDTV, in certain episodes, and in certain scenes, the image is very grainy and less defined.  I don't know all the technical reasons for this, but it is quite noticeable at times.  However, the show is so good that these temporary distractions (at least for a videophile like me) are vastly outweighed by the enjoyment provided by the enchanting stories and characters in each and every episode.",1409184000,2,793,4.676258992805756

This show is so much better than 99% of what's available now; my daughters laugh and laugh and always end up learning some lesson (and have I mentioned how much less painful it is to have this playing than, say, Hannah Montana??). My husband made the observation that, back then, families tended to watch more television together, and I get that (though I usually watched it alone after school!).

My daughers age 4 and 6 have now seen two episodes and absolutely LOVE it.  I'm so happy I bought it even though I've seen them so much I'm kind of sick of them.

3438590,4,B000USU9LC,"Because of GiILLIGAN'S ISLAND and THE BRADY BUNCH, writer-producer Sherwood Schwartz will forever be a TV hall-of-famer. They were his only real hits, but they were both grand slams in their prime-times and have remained syndicated favorites ever since.

Following closely on the GiILLIGAN'S ISLAND Season 2 release, THE BRADY BUNCH is ready for home theaters with a nicely designed, 4-disc set of 25 first-season episodes. The pilot episode, ""The Honeymoon"" sets up the story we all know from the theme song (lyrics by Schwartz) by giving us the marriage of Mike and Carol and the coming together of the 6 kids.

Schwartz provides commentary for just this first show, but he fondly recalls his intention of sweet, subdued, and often corny gags the pre-fab family encountered as a precise format each week.

Two other episodes include commentary by Barry Williams (Greg), Christopher Knight (Peter), and Susan Olson (Cindy), and their reminiscences are equally affectionate about time on the show and everyone's surprise at its enormous success.

Every Brady episode is a classic in some sense, and this first of 5 seasons throughout the Brady's 1969-74 run on ABC(those Brady kids did grow up fast) includes some real charmers when the 6 Brady kids still seemed impossibly young.

It's hard to say the show was ever hip, even though it became slightly more attuned to a pop sensibility as the Bradys moved into the '70s. But man, is this 1969 every family ever square. Even so, it's hard to resist the way each one gets their own screen time with shows devoted to simple childhood joys and traumas--Jan's missing locket, Cindy's missing baby doll, Greg's crush on his math teacher, Peter's swelled head when he gets his picture in the paper, etc.

In a brief bonus featurette we get more innocuously entertaining interview comments from Schwartz, Williams, Olson, Knight, and Mike Lookinland (Bobby). It's interesting that all the subjects make note of how seriously the classically trained (now-deceased) Robert Reed took his role as patriarch(Mike Brady).

His reputation as being ""difficult"" followed the long run of the show, but if Schwartz's first choice had gotten the role it could have been a lot worse. (Schwartz is delighted to reveal the famous name and career path that followed, so the mystery shouldn't be spoiled here.) As it was during its TV run, THE BRADY BUNCH on DVD is clearly meant for a specific generation--yours.

This 1969-70 Season of the Brady's tells us the story of Carol, a single mother of 3 girls  Marcia, Jan and Cindy and architect Mike Brady, a single father of 3 boys  Greg, Peter and Bobby who get married and blend the 2 families into one.

Added to the mix are housekeeper Alice and dog Tiger. The Bradys experience the same obstacles as any family, from adjusting to their new extended family, to sibling rivalry. The comedy series famous for its catchy theme song truly has become a pop culture icon and is still enjoyed by viewers of all ages.

I used to also watch THE BRADY BUNCH in reruns on ME-TV, TV Land, and Nickelodeon too.",1390435200,,3076,4.894230769230769
3438591,5,B000USU9LC,"This DVD set is great.  The quality is wonderful.  Having all the shows in order is a real bonus - we can watch the kids as they grow.  Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love it.  Some concepts are difficult to understand - but they totally get it when the siblings fight and then I'm there to explain how it gets resolved.  There are alot of ""dummies"" and ""stupids"" thrown around so you have to be careful about that.  I never realized that the first time I watched this show in the 70s but now that we don't use those words at home they are really glaring when the kids on the show use it.  Overall though, I would rate the quality of the DVD and the quality of the show itself 5 stars.  We love it.  It's wholesome entertainment that provides real life lessons.  Here the parents are the ones who are smart.  Not like other Disney or Nick shows where the parents are just fools.",1388275200,3,884,4.111111111111111

The nowadays TV shows are full of bad examples, people treat each other in a very bad way. That can happen in the Brady Bunch too but the parents are always correcting the kids when that happens. In I Carly, for example, the character of Sam is always treating everybody in an irritable way, and even though it can be funny at certain moments, you wouldn't like your kids to behave like that.",1387584000,3,552,4.368932038834951

3438605,5,B000USU9LC,"I purchased this specifically to introduce my children to The Brady Bunch that I grew up loving.  I am sooooooooo glad that I did.  My children love this show.  And, Oh the memories that have come flooding back.  My daughter begs to watch The Brady Bunch every day.  We have a movie night on the weekend and are going through each season.  Opportunities to share part of your childhood with your own children do not come around all the time so I am thankful for this opportunity.  Purchasing these dvd's is well worth it, if for no other reason than being able to spend time sharing something you loved with your chidlren.

The dvd quality was flawless.  It was simply much better than I expected.  Each dvd has several shows on it that are listed in the menu.  The menues are easily navigated.  Each show starts by showing the Brady's (very young) all lined up on the stairs with some brady music playing.  My kids love that part.

We are on season 2 and my kids are amazed at how the Brady kids have grown.  Just wait until they meet Johnny Bravo!

Again, the quality is supurb.  I highly recommend these dvds.  I did consider purchasing the set with the shag carpet which had all the dvds in cardboard sleeves, but the reviews scared me off with the complaints of glue sticking on the dvds and the dvds getting scratched.  These dvds are all in plastic cases and are well protected.  Oh, and I like having the Lenticular printing (wiggle pictures/3d pictures) on the cover of each season that show the Brady's looking around at each other as they do in the intro.  My daughter loves to play with them.  So if you are considering purchasing these dvds then do not hesitate and get them now.  You absolutely will not regret the purchase.

Enjoy the memories!

Here are all the seasons I purchased:

3438615,1,B000USU9LC,"I love watching the Brady Bunch. The show itself is great, the product I recieved is not.

There's no doubt in my mind that I recieved a bootleg version of the first season. The dvd packaging is not the same as pictured. The entire Paramount logo at the top of the cover is missing. The faces of the characters are stretched and distorted. The discs are not separated into two boxes with artwork of the characters on blue and yellow backgrounds. The artwork on the discs is grainy and stretched as well.

When watching the dvd, the picture quality is not good. Much of the footage is blurry and out of focus. The picture is not crisp and clear. The minute I recieved my dvd I felt something was not right. My packaging just looked off. Like a cheap copycat version.

My fears were confirmed when I started watching the dvd with a family member and they commented that the picture quality of the dvd was less than desirable. I understand that visuals from a show filmed so long ago wouldn't be up to par with that of a series filmed today, but that is not the isuue I was having.

I also found it suspicious when I was unable to contact the seller. I talked to Amazon customer service and was sent a prepaid label so I can send the item back.

At one time on TVLand/NickatNight, they did Popup versions of the Brady Bunch which, as you might imagination, had popup facts through out the show.  Of all the seasons on DVD, sadly this feature doesn't appear in any of them.  Having a classic show like this on DVD, and at a great price is a tremendous value.

I find that with many oldies, I am disappointed as it is not quite what I remembered. They usually end up boring me and become dust collectors.

The Brady's is one of those DVDs I pop into the machine especially after a long, hard day in the real world and am instantly taken back in time when life seemed a whole lot easier. This show will actually bring back memories of my childhood that were long forgotten. I once even remembered a blue summer sky and the smell of freshly cut grass :)

""The Brady Bunch"" is one of the fairly rare breed of TV series that anyone can watch at any age.  Perhaps the ultimate family sitcom, it stars Robert Reed, Florence Henderson, Ann B. Davis, and a genuine ensemble of child actors who have each gained a kind of celebrity simply for so naturally embodying the Brady kids.

Originally airing from 1969 to 1974, the show is clean, almost impossibly clean, but also fairly well-balanced in its storytelling.  Every Brady kid has some kind of relatable issue, whether it's Marcia's hidden insecurities despite her popularity, Jan's middle-child syndrome, Peter's masculine version of the same issue, or Greg's older brother childish bully/protector complex.  A prevailing sense of optimism, though, is what has truly given this series longevity and staying power.  The cast chemistry is impressive, when one considers the size of the main cast, and the backstage stories most of us have heard by now.

I loved this series when I was growing up.  I could tell by its style it wasn't current then, and I didn't overly think about the exact time period in which it might have first aired.  ""The Brady Bunch"" as a whole pulls off a nearly impossible balancing act.  In fashions,(bell bottoms, afros,and speech)it proudly, albeit not exclusively, belongs to the 1960's and '70's era of American popular culture.  But, in its themes and overall classy tone, it remains absolutely timeless.",1306540800,,1444,5.076271186440678

3438631,5,B000USU9LC,"Season 1 is very distinct compared to Seasons 2-5 in that it is focused on the blending of the family and the trials and tribulations that come from it.. The adjustments to that regard make up for some serious and emotional storylines. It all adds up to some serious 60's family drama that would be sorely missing during the later seasons when things get goofier and sillier.

""Every Boy Does It Once"" and ""Father of the Year"" are good examples of emotionally charged episodes. In fact the season boasts numerous tearjerker moments.

Of course the season has its share of humor and fun episodes like ""A Clubhouse is Not a Home"" and ""A-Camping We Will Go.""

But more than anything else the season is probably rememberfed most for its sweet endings. Almost every episode has that including the ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" where Alice tries to leave the Bradys after being felt unneeded and the season finale ""Lost Locket, Found Locket"" which is centered around lovable loser Jan Brady.

If you like serious, crisp writing with uplifting endings you'll like this season the most.",1262649600,,1082,4.832432432432433

3438633,5,B000USU9LC,"It's hard to believe that on September 26, 2009 we will be celebrating 40 years of ""The Brady Bunch"" for it was way back in 1969 that the Bradys made their debut on ABC. It's even harder to believe that ""The Brady Bunch"" never once cracked the top 25 on the weekly Nielsen charts. Like many of my generation I grew up watching my favorite family every day after school when the show first went into national syndication in 1975. Since that moment I have had a love affair with Mike, Carol, Alice, and those six kids for my entire life. Very rarely has a mere sitcom touched me, but ""The Brady Bunch"" is more than a comedy show: it is an American institution that has found its way into pop culture and thanks to DVD we can enjoy these timeless episodes for posterity. This first DVD set contains all 25 season one shows uncut and they have been cleaned and remastered from their original Paramount tapes. One of the best episodes from the Bradys is the pilot that was actually shot in the summer of 1968 and its the only episode that doesn't take place in the famous Brady house. Once the show was sold producers shot exteriors at the famous Brady house in the San Fernando Valley. The pilot, ""The Honeymoon"", introduces us to the clan as Mike and Carol say their vows with their six children. Other highlights from season 1 are ""The Voice of Christmas"" which is the only Holiday episode shot where Carol loses her voice just before she is to sing at Church on Christmas Eve; Desi Arnaz Jr. makes an apperance in ""The Possible Dream"" where Marcia admits to having a crush on Lucy's real-life son; ""Father of The Year"", ""Brace Yourself"", and ""Dear Libby"" (the first official Brady episode) are all standouts. Thankfully, Paramount has released all five seasons of ""The Brady Bunch"" on DVD both in individual boxsets and in a complete series edition. There are also two very informative books written on the Bradys, both by stars of the show: Barry Williams wrote ""Growing Up Brady"" that has neat anecdotes on the show as well as air dates and synopsis of all 117 episodes. Maureen McCormick recently penned ""Here's The Story"", her autobiography, that contains excellent info on the series and its stars.",1252627200,,2202,4.6055979643765905

Thank goodness her character became more outgoing and likeable and even Jan was more sincere! The first season is messy and silly, the rest of the seasons had better and funnier storylines.

3438638,4,B000USU9LC,"Ahhh, the Bradys. How can we ever forget that lovable textbook sitcom family that made us laugh, cry and throw-up! They were the last of the fairy-tale families from Cleaverville and Nelsontown before Norman Lear threw the Bunkers in our faces.

Created by Sherwood Schwartz, he came up with the idea in the mid-sixties but decided to sit on it. Then the success of Lucille Ball's film Yours, Mine & Ours (based on real life family of 20 kids the Beardsleys) came, and Schwartz went full steam ahead.

The pilot starts off with the wedding of two single parents which is never explained whether they're divorced or widowed. I can imagine they're of course widowed being how divorce was still a touchy subject especially for a sugar dripping show like this.

Florence Henderson's Carol (soon-to-be-Brady) Martin didn't exactly have the sex appeal of previous TV moms like Laura Petrie or Samantha Stevens, her face looks like it was squashed in a vice, but with the mini-skirts in style then, she sure had a great set of legs and a nice big rear-end as well. Then there's closet gay Robert Reed's all wise, all knowing and all even-tempered architect Mike Brady to round out the parental duties. The kids? Well, they're just a bunch of unknowns fresh off of commercials, modeling or whatever that can't act worth a mosquito's butt. Aside from the lack of acne, masturbation, drugs and drinking, they were pretty typical kids. And finally we have comic relief from veteran funny lady Ann B. Davis as the goofy but sincere maid Alice.

For five years the show went through the typical family thoroughfare of raising six kids without any political or social commentary. Sex didn't exist, drugs didn't exist, rock 'n roll barely existed and bathrooms without toilets DID exist! But it was this syrupy phoniness that made the show so endearing that it would make you laugh at it and not with it.

Today, the show has become a cult phenomenon and been revisited in many ways from reunion specials (including a terrible short-lived variety hour in the seventies), spinoffs, parodies and threatrical remakes. The surviving cast members have been doing nothing but living off poking fun at it and a good job doing it too.

So, get some milk and cookies and pop in a disc and get ready to laugh, cry or throw-up. Don't expect to see Reed in the final episode, he was in such a riff with Schwartz that he refused to participate. I think it was that episode when one of the kids gets in trouble, I don't know.",1192924800,2,2496,4.700228832951945

3438644,5,B000USU9LC,"There are very few television shows that have any staying power like the Brady Bunch. A television show that centered on the complicated lives of two parents getting married bringing with them each three kids from previous marriages. The hilarity ensues as the Brady household is quickly filled with six kids, a housekeeper, and a dog. The series avoided the common mistake of using current references and issues and stuck to the ageless problems encountered by growing kids. This formula gave the Brady Bunch a timeless quality that holds up today and makes for very wholesome family entertainment. The Brady Bunch may have only aired for five seasons, but it became the subject of countless spin-offs, parodies and look-a-likes. Many adults have fond memories of growing up with the Brady Bunch, and it is referenced continually in pop culture, giving it a special place in television history.

Paramount Television Collection continues their catalog releases with the popular Brady Bunch, but this time they have included a welcome change with the addition of a couple of extras. A featurette, as well as three episodes containing commentaries, are bonus features found on this set. All 25 first season episodes are included in this set and clock in at about 10 hours and 52 minutes according to the box. A common inclusion to all the Paramount Television releases recently, are multiple promos for various other sets. The promos are for Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, Mork & Mindy and MacGyver. Each promo has a chapter index at the beginning to facilitate jumping to the main menu. The main menu itself is a static screen with a very colorful style common to the late '60s. The selection icon tends to get lost in the background on the main menu until you begin to navigate.

Packaging:

The set comes in a box with the 9-panel opening of the show recreated with a lenticular cover on the front. The lenticular cover is a neat touch that works quite well in good light. Inside the box are two slim cases each containing two single sided discs. The episode descriptions and original airdates for both discs are found on the back of each slim case. The artwork is full of screen captures and wonderful moments from the series, and the disc silk screens are very colorful and feature two of each characters' from the show.

Commentary Tracks

Creator/Producer Sherwood Schwartz provides commentary on the first episode entitled ""The Wedding."" His commentary lacks in any extensive detail with regards to this episode, and he tends to repeat things mentioned in the featurette. Sherwood Schwartz sticks to what he knows and talks about producing a series.

The commentary tracks on episode 8 ""a-Camping We Will Go"" and episode 21 ""The Hero"" are provided by Barry Williams (Greg), Christopher Knight (Peter) and Susan Olsen (Cindy). These commentary tracks make up for the first one with the enthusiasm and energy of the three actors. The actors reminisce about everything from the costumes and props, to inside details about certain scenes and neat little tidbits of information about the episodes. These commentaries are well worth listening to for an inside perspective on the creation of the show and its impact on the actors.

The Brady Bunch - Coming Together Under One Roof (17:29)

This is a 17 1/2 minute featurette that gives a broad perspective of the show and its creation. It provides a good intro to the series and is a welcome addition to this set for younger viewers and new viewers to the series. I look forward to seeing whether there was more material shot during the interviews that we will see on the next season sets.",1158537600,,3639,4.896103896103896
3438645,3,B000USU9LC,"The Brady Bunch was on the air between 1969-1974...that's five years, people...what were we thinkin' to have them gone on for that long? Were we really that stoned in the 70s? C'mon!

Actually, I rather like the Brady Bunch especially season one. As the show progressed it seemed to get hokier and hokier. I guess Robert Reed (Mike Brady) was a real tyrant on the set; always battling with the writers and the directors. For those of you who don't know, Robert Reed was a classically trained actor and so, yeah, of course he's gonna have problems with the scripts and the direction of the show...but hey, Robert....""IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE SHAKESPEARE!""

I guess this show is now considered to be a television classic. Who knew? Even when it was on it never reached the top ten. It was always in the low double digits and now it's part of permanent pop culture. It's so stained with the 70s. Bad hair, bad clothes, bad furniture, bad painting schemes...I find myself watchin' it and I think to myself, ""Good God...what were we thinking?"" And then I see an old picture of myself from right around the same period at ten years old; maroon pants, an orange shirt, long hair jammed to the side sitting on a frickin' green and blue velvet chair...dang. What was I thinking?

It's a good show. It can be pretty funny at times. My favorite all time episode is when the two families had just become one and the ""yucky 'ol girls"" were going on the annual camping trip with the ""Brady men.""

I guess in years past, the Brady men just lived off of what they could fish out of the lake. well, not this time, they caught absolutely nuthin'. So knowing that the boys were feeling dejected as well as hungry, Carol whips out a picnic basket full of fried chicken and potato salad. Mike is about to dig in when a horrified Greg screams out, ""Dad! Don't! That's sissy food...""

Cracks me up every time...

So, if you're in your 40s and you haven't yet had each episode drilled into your brain at least sixty times since they've been on in syndication, get the collection...or at least Season 1. You'll be thinkin' to yourself, ""Holy crap! What was I thinkin'...?""",1156982400,4,2147,4.520618556701031
3438646,5,B000USU9LC,"This first season is 'primo' stuff!  The stories are engaging and original with the 2 blended families adapting to one another.  I grew up with the Bradys and I remember the first episode I happened to catch by accident...its the one where Bobby wants to run away from home.  This was the first episode of the series I ever saw and I've been a ""Brady"" fan since then.  Mike Lookinland gave a very touching, wonderful performance in this episode and I cry every time I watch it.  Other classics are:  ""Sorry, Right Number"" (a.k.a. they pay phone episode), ""Brace Yourself"" (Marcia's Braces), the camping episode, the episode where Carol and Mike switch places with the kids for a day, ""Alice DOesn't Live Here Anymore"" (showcasing Ann B. Davis' superior comedic talents) and ""The Hero"" (Peter saves a little girl in a toy store episode).  There are also mediocre episodes like ""Mike's Horrorscope"", ""Kitty Carryall is Missing"" (plot borrowed from Family Affair's Mrs. Beasley where are You), ""Tiger, Tiger"" (this mutt is annoying).  But all in all an excellent beginning for what was to be a true seventies icon!  Another excellent episode is the ""trading stamp"" episode...where the kids are building the house with cards.  The DVD quality ranges from excellent to good.  Sometimes the episodes appear faded and grainy but not to an annoying extent.  I loved the documentary feature on the last disc ""Back to the Bradys"" which features series creator Sherwood Shwartz along with Susan Olsen (Cindy), Barry Williams (Greg), Chris Knight (Peter) and Mike Lookinland (Bobby).  Too bad they couldn't have included Florence Henderson, Ann B., Maureen McCormick or Eve Plumb in this but its still good to hear them reminisce.  Who would have believed that Robert Reed, the perfect image of the ""all american father"" was gay?  And the casting?  Barry Williams and Mike Lookinland favor Reed in uncanny ways.  A great series!

3438647,5,B000USU9LC,"One of the best family shows that has ever been produced for TV, ""The Brady Bunch"" just isn't a TV show about a `60's family, it draws the viewer in and makes him or her feel they're part of this ""groovy"" family.  That's the perception that I've gotten from watching the ""Brady Bunch"" while growing up.  In just a few short episodes, the characters become very familiar, you enjoy the family's outings, such as camping trips, vacations, and even slumber parties.  Season 1 features a lot of great episodes, with my personal favorites: ""A-Camping We Will Go,"" with the family experiencing their first camping trip. ""Is There A Doctor in the House?"" with all the Brady kids coming down with the measles. ""54-40 And Fight,"" with the boys and the girls in high competition of who gets to make a purchase with the trading stamp books.  And the spooky fun of ""To Move or Not to Move?"" with the haunting of the Brady house!  This season was followed by four more great seasons, all of which are now available to own in complete season sets on dvd!  It's a blast from the past and true ""TV escapism"" that can be enjoyed with each and every episode!  I also recommend another `60's TV family coming to DVD on June 27, 2006, ""Family Affair,"" and like ""The Brady Bunch,"" it showcases family morals while at the same time entertaining and charming the viewer.  These shows may get blasted for being ""sugar coated,"" ""unrealistic,"" or even ""corny,"" but if these terms mean ""family friendly,"" ""enjoyable,"" and ""funny"" then that's usually what many of us are watching TV to see!",1146441600,,1562,4.634057971014493
3438648,5,B000USU9LC,"I think that The Brady Bunch really had its second wind of success in 1978, four years after it ended in 1974. Local stations would show it constantly on weekday afternoons. It was the perfect show for young people to watch, myself included, back then. People at school were talking about the shows, even saying Marcia, Marcia, Marcia in some cases! Perhaps a better alternative watching cartoons,as it showed a family. Of the five seasons, I really liked the first season from 1969-1970 the most, at least the newness of the characters. Marcia, Cindy, Jan, Greg, Peter, Bobby, Mike, Carol and Alice were so funny in their shows. One thing I noticed from the first season was that Greg was always walking barefooted on some shows. Even when he went to the bathroom in one scene. I wonder if the producers noticed that. They changed the theme music after the first season, but I liked that original theme song. This show has all the bases covered in how families live, even though it's a different matter in real life. Took me three years from '78 to 1981 to watch most of the 117 shows, though I hated the fifth season's shows.  But it's had a lasting impact on popular culture, its morals, its values, its emphasis on family so prevalent with humor always common.  It's had huge success on all levels in syndication, video, TBS, some cable networks and it will have that same success on DVD. I'm sure the afternoon ratings had to have been huge on local stations that showed it in syndication between 1978 and 1983!

3438652,5,B000USU9LC,"This has been one of my all time favorite shows when I was growimg up. It has not gone out of style. Some think that this show is corny-but I don't agree. It deals with subjects that every family goes thru-and if you have grown up in a large family-then you can idenify with the Brady Bunch.

Two of my favorite episodes from the first season is. ""Dear Libby"" & ""The hero"" The Latter is the one I want to discuss here a bit because in my opinion, it teaches a very important lesson about what happens when you allow your 15 minutes of fame go over your head.

In ""The Hero"", Peter(Kris Knight) is in a toy store where a little girl attempts to scale a shelf to reach a doll, the shelf begins to loosen from the wall and Peter rescues the girl before the shelf falls to the ground saving her life. A newspaper finds out about it and does a story on Peter. He gets his picture in the paper and everyone is impressed. But Peter allows it to get to him and ends up irratating his freinds and family. It goes from bad to worse when the mother of the girl offers to buy Peter anything and everything at the toy store. This is where the parents drew the line-they allowed hin to heep one of the gifts-but made hin send the rest back.

When the newspaper make hin ""Hero of the month"" He uses the $50.00 reward money to throw a party for himself, he invites his friends-but no one came. He learned his lesson. Peter did a wonderful thing here-he saved the life of the girl-and he should be commended for it-but the problem in this case is that Peter lets it go farther than that. Good episode!

Another favorite is ""Found locket, lost locket"" Jan recieves a locket from a secret admirer. They try to figure out who sent it-but when the locket disapears-the family does a reenactment of ""the crime"" where everyone is doing eactly what they were doing the night the locket disapears. Jan remembers an important detail that helps her find it. If you have not seen this episode, be prepared for a suprise as to who sent Jan the Locket! Wonderful episode.

I love the lighthearted nature of this show. I think the main reason why this show remains popular today is that it has everything a parent could want in a show for thier childern and does not have the trash that pervails in most sit-coms today.

Having these shows on DVD allows you to see things that are cut out for television. You get the full unedited versions of the show! This fact alone is worth the $30.00 price tag. You will not be disapointed!",1128988800,2,2497,4.313432835820896

I always knew the chemistry was spot-on perfect but what struck me most was how well the dramatic moments were handled. The pilot with Mike and Bobby, Cindy's one ticket problem in Eenie, Meenie, and even Marcia's reading of the troubled family in Dear Libby are actually quite touching. I still find it amazing to have such a large cast, yet the chemistry is so good, you would think they really knew each other as friends before the show, or that they were a real family, and I guess that's what has made this show an icon.

I also bought Season Two, actually it was a gift but I can't help but notice there were no extras, like the one's included here. After viewing them I think I know why. Firstly, the commentaries; all three are just a mixed bag. The Sherwood commentary is rather dry and much of it is repeated in the paultry ""17 minute"" Under One Roof extra. The highly touted ""kids commentary"" doesn't fare any better. Yes, you get a tidbit or two but what the whole thing really amounts to are Williams, Knight, & Olsen putting the show and themselves down (a mockumentary). It's apparent it was in good fun but it comes off more as a distraction. Had a commentary been included on Season Two I probably would have skipped it anyway.

The picture and sound seem adequate considering the age of the print and audio but I think I expected a better picture. I would give both a 3 star rating. Not terrible but not great either. The nice consolation about Paramount discs are at least they do not freeze up and pixel like Universal sets. Lastly, I can say the pricepoint is nice, the packaging is price conscious but not CHEAP.",1123200000,2,1893,4.497093023255814

Not this time though, they added a lendicular cover and a few extras. This set is also a space saver too.

3438670,4,B000USU9LC,"The Pilot episode of The Brady Bunch aptly sets up the way of the show with an ending that's almost totally out of reality.

The unrealness continues with, for instance, shows where the whole family comes to a halt to search for Cindy's missing doll.

Unrealness, is not a bad word, by the way. On the contrary, I think today's TV's obsession with ""reality"" only makes for a more pessimistic unreality as now they strive to make every TV family more dysfunctional than most will ever be.

For example, In retribution for the wise, selfless and caring dads of the sitcoms of old we now have a pack of moronic, weak and selfish dads who are constantly inferior to the kids and/or the wife.

While this sort of thing is funny when the show is done right (like The Simpsons and occasionally Malcolm In The Middle) it grows tired real quick and one starts preferring the other side of unreality.

That's where The Brady Bunch comes in.

The Brady Bunch was never a great show, but it was a sweet and enjoyable one. Where the writing of the show was weak, at least you had good chemistry between the kids and kids and the adults.

For a show that seems firmly a part of the 1970's, this first season certainly looks more like the sitcoms of the late 60's to be sure. The look of color shows back then were made to take advantage of color TV that while it was not exactly new, was finally starting to go mainstream.

That means most color shows were really IN COLOR, bright primary colors. Almost any color show of that time was a feast for those who loved color.

The plots for the first season are pretty much standard issue sitcom plots. I mean, every show back then had the ""One member of the family might be allergic to a pet or another family member"" episode.

Being the first season both Greg and Marcia are freakishly young. It would take at least a couple years for Marcia to start to blossom into the leggy proto babish high school dream date people remember her for.

In this season the one most fun to watch is Cindy, I crack up when she makes an angry face at someone. The lisp is always a great touch too.

Season one standouts:

The Honeymoon: or the pilot. Like I said, this pilot aptly set the tone for the rest of the series, especially at the end where a guilty Mike and Carol decide to invite the children to the Honeymoon (They felt guilty for yelling at the kids after their pets got loose and ruined the wedding reception! Can you imagine that?). It's punctuated by a couple of sweet moments like when Mike tells Bobby that it's okay to remember his original mother. It's too bad that Fluffy the cat didn't get carried over to the series proper. It would've made for some Tiger/Fluffy rival episodes and cute animal antics are always the icing on the cake for shows like this.

Katchoo: It's the Brady's version of this eternal sitcom plot. Jan seems to develop a mysterious allergy to Tiger. In the hopes of not having to get rid of Tiger, the girls, the boys, Carol and Alice and then Mike all secretly put poor Tiger through one bath after the other truly making the dog water phobic. Those bath scenes really make this episode a funny watch.

Kitty Karry-All is Missing: Cindy's Kitty Karry-All disappears right after Bobby was in the room. This episode's a bit sneaky, slipping in a little education on civics for the kiddies (innocent until proven guilty, circumstantial evidence). A great scene for memorabilia collectors is to look at the toy store scene. You can see a Remco Star Trek ""flying rocket plane"" toy (try finding one of those on Ebay!). You can also see a Lost In Space robot toy and several other vintage toys.

Father of the Year: While trying to keep her essay entry for a contest on ""Father Of The Year"" secret, Marcia does a few things that cause harsher and harsher punishments from her hopeful ""Father Of The Year"". Of course, a simple explanation would clear things up and prevent punishment but also disqualify her from the contest. Marcia doesn't flinch and continues to see through the hurt of the punishments to the greatness of her new father. As corny as it is, I dare you not to feel for Marcia and not to get misty when the end you know is coming finally comes.

Lost Locket, Found Locket: Jan receives a locket from a secret Admirer. Soon after she gets it, it disappears prompting a whole family reenactment of the time it disappeared. The episode ends with a really nice scene between Alice and Jan.

Most of the shows on season one are a good watch.

The quality of the shows on this DVD is much better than you will ever see on cable. Print quality is clean but sharpness is variable. Even in the same episode some scenes are sharper than others. It's not too much of a big deal but kind of curious anyway. You can expect scenes with effects (in the case of the Brady Bunch, superimposed titles, dissolves or the popping up of the boxed heads at the end of act 2) to be less sharp but scenes beyond those have a sharpness shift.

Color is saturated throughout, which is great. To get the full effect of these shows (and to mimic the broadcasting done back then to accentuate the color) you want them the color to pop like a technicolor musical.

Audio is perfectly fine and clean, so much so that in the episode ""A-Camping We Will Go"" you can hear that the ""hoot hoot"" of an owl was cut in from a scratchy soundtrack of perhaps an old movie.

Kudos to Paramount for not ignoring the opening ""Brady Bunch In color"" slide and not supplanting the vintage Paramount logo for the new one (I'm always bugged by studios cutting in their most recent logos to films and TV shows of the past. Paramount is as bad an offender of that as any. I'm glad they decided not to do it for these shows).

Most importantly, the shows are uncut. You know, even on channels that purport to be a place where old shows are revered, the shows themselves are put through all manor of indignities. They are time compressed (which makes for that somewhat noticeable Jerky movement and ""hiccups"" in the sound), the channel logo is ever-present on the bottom of the screen. They superimpose text and even images and sound for shows coming up next (or soon) and they can't wait to squeeze out the closing credits in order to do more promotion. Finally, 2-4 minutes get cut from half hour shows. Cutting stuff out of syndicated reruns is nothing new but more is cut now than most stations ever did. Back then, some stations cut, some didn't and the amount of time cut varied from station to station. Now channels get pre edited video masters from the studios and sometimes the channel even cuts more.

TV on DVD is the only way to escape these atrocities so I'm glad it's catching on.

The extras are kind of sparse but fun. Sherwood Shwartz is always fun to listen to talking about his shows. You get to hear him do commentary for the pilot and on the roundabout 1/2 hour featurette.

What's more fun is to hear the grown up Brady Kids (3 of them) do commentary on a couple shows. They have fun, make fun of each other and themselves and give a little bit of info about the making of the show. All great fun.

Most children of the 60's and 70's will find themselves watching the shows here with a tranced out goofy grin. The Brady Bunch will weave it's peculiar magic over you once again.

Its  so wonderful  that  Paramount has given us these episodes all uncut!  As you know, anytime  the series is shown on TV,they  are always chopped up  to make room for lots of boring ads!

Its great  also to know that Paramount is going to release  more seasons this year  and so, this makes for  real happiness  to me.

We must remember though, this series was originally made on a low budget so with today's quality sets and DVD's, the errors are more clearly detected.  The sound quality is much better than reruns especially comparing it to how we were used to hearing it originally from a 4-5"" oval speaker back in 1969. So good in fact on the Father of the Year episode, if you listen closely, you can actually see and hear a click as they turn on more lighting. There are 2 different ""in color"" slides that haven't been seen in years and other noticable differences.  It was disappointing that only 2 episodes had commentaries.  Those were really entertaining especially Susan Olsen's suggestion to take a shot every time Peter Said ""WOW"".

3438674,5,B000USU9LC,"Few DVD releases have been more far out (farther out?) than ""Brady Bunch Season One.""

Every day after school, cousinpaco's old pal chatchi would come over for the 4:35 ""Brady Bunch"" on SuperStation TBS. Amazingly, we grew up straight, and are happily married (not to each other).

This daily ritual caused cousinpaco's memory to link specific real-life events to each episode - I can remember which ""Brady Bunch"" was on the day chatchi got the cool car in ""R.C. Pro-Am"" for the first time (it was the one where Jan thinks she's allergic to Tiger). I know that part of Megatron's scope went missing the same day Mike installed a pay-phone in the Brady living room. And I can't even tell you - Fifth Amendment and all that - what happened after the kids used their trading stamps to get a color TV. Let's just say that launching a tennis ball out of soup cans sounded like a good idea at the time.

But aside from cousinpaco's over-developed sense of nostalgia, the ""Brady Bunch"" DVDs commemorate one of television's greatest actors: Robert Reed. Seriously. Given what we've learned in the years since - from his alternative lifestyle (one that would have been even more controversial back in the day) to his troubles with his own family - it's a testament to Reed's acting skills that he was so believable as the Ultimate American Dad. Given his reported disdain for the show, he'd probably hate to hear that, but Reed's Mike Brady was The MAN.

And that chick who wanted to build a factory in the shape of a giant powder-puff was pretty fierce.

So I think it's totally ""groovy"" that the Bunch is now on DVD. I can re-live all those great memories! Best of all, this is ""Brady Bunch"" at its best - no ""Time to Change"" pop songs, no ludicrous perms, and no Cousin Oliver (the Scrappy Doo of Bradyland).",1110153600,6,1802,4.583850931677019

3438681,5,B000USU9LC,"Say what you want about The Brady Bunch.. it can be ridiculed for the awful writing, the mediocre acting, and the non-existent plotting, but it sure makes for great comfort TV.  This is the one season where all the Brady kids were still cute, Alice was a brunette, and Carol's wig took up half the screen.  And it all takes me back to 1969 (well I was born that year but it takes me back to those afternoons in the 70's watching the show in syndication).  Yes, I am a Bradymaniac, and am thrilled that the show has finally made it to DVD.  There is something magical about this absurdly sacharine family and their trivial predicaments that makes you wish you were a Brady yourself, wallpaper fashions and all.  The stories are fluff but the magic is in the interactions among the characters and the fantasy of having perfectly ideal parents.  And that cavernous 3-bedroom house!

Subsequent seasons of BB got less interesting, as the kids each outgrew their cuteness and failed to age like normal children.  The clothes also got louder and louder.

The DVD set is fantastic.  All 25 first-season episodes are here, plus a 17-minute documentary (like other reviewers have commented, there's not much new info here).  The colors are vibrant (this was before the loud clothes began popping up on the screen - everyone wore Sherman WIlliams-approved solids) and the cut scenes for syndication purposes restored.  THis is truly a fantastic treat for all Brady fans (and no more watching the chopped up episodes on TBS or TV LAND!!!).",1109721600,7,1528,4.768060836501901
3438682,5,B000USU9LC,"I grew up watching re-runs of the ""Brady Bunch"" in syndication, and my sons and I still watch this show together on TVLand.  I have waited a long time for these to come out on DVD, because so many scenes and lines of dialogue are cut out of the shows now when they are shown on T.V.  In response to the reviewers who are SO negative about this show, I say this; WHY DID YOU BUY THIS DVD SET? If you hated the show so much when it was shown on T.V., don't waste money on the DVDS and then get on Amazon and gripe about how stupid the show was!  Sure, the situations the Bradys faced had nothing to do with Vietnam, or teen pregnancy, or getting drunk, but hey, weren't people dealing with those things on a daily basis in the 60's and 70's every time they turned on the news? Give me the Brady Bunch for a healthy dose of escapism any day!",1109635200,10,838,4.036144578313253
3438683,5,B000USU9LC,"I was between 5 and 10 years old when this show aired, so of course I loved it.  It was a Friday night ritual to watch this and the Partridge Family.  It is about time this is being released on DVD, I will look forward to other seasons being released in the future.  My favorite seasons are probably 3 and 4, especially the Hawaii trip.  By season 5 you could tell they were running out of ideas, but the redeeming feature about the last season was watching Marcia and Jan turn into such hot babes.  As far as season one goes, in all the episodes until ""The Voice of Christmas"", make note of the awful wig Florence is wearing.  She had a role before the show that required very short hair, and the show's producers decided that Mrs. Brady couldn't have such short hair.  The solution:  Put an absolutely awful looking wig on her until it grows out.  Also of note, the first six episodes were all shot at once, mostly out of sequence, which helps explain the puzzling order in which they were aired.  To those of you who have given one star reviews, phooey on you!  If you don't like it, DON'T WATCH IT!!!  If you really want to use your brain, turn off all of the other 128 channels and read a book!!!  This is not Shakespeare, it is just 22 minutes per episode of harmless good natured fluff.  You will not convince me that 99% of the crap that passes for a sitcom these days is any more entertaining or intelligent, so get off your high horse.  And a few points for John Q. - 1.  Learn to spell.  2.  The actors did work again and did not have major drug, alcohol, or pregnancy problems.  They may not have been huge stars but they did continue to work.  3.  It is not Hollywood's (whoever that may be) job to raise kids, it is their parent's job.  Acting on television is a business, and just like any other business, people come and go.  4.  All in the Family and MASH were great shows, but it was Sanford and Son that eventually knocked the Bradys off the air.",1109548800,13,1965,4.248648648648649
3438684,5,B000USU9LC,"This is in responce to the reviewer C. Penn Reader who is listed below me - The Brady Bunch is an excellent tv show that deserves to have all 5 seasons put on DVD so people who know good tv can enjoy, you go ahead and have your 128 channels with all that new crap that is out there these days and keep your lousy opinions to yourself - keep watching all that new junk  because they won't be around for 36 years like The Brady Bunch which has withstood the test of time.",1109462400,11,469,3.9893617021276597

8274378,5,B000USU9LC,"A very enjoyable trip down memory lane.  The first season is very well down, and one of the most interesting aspect of this season is the fact that the 1970's hairstyles and clothing styles, which the Brady Bunch would become associated in later seasons, are not presented here.  Also, even though it is a comedy even in the first season, there's an element of seriousness about it.  This is no doubt due to the fact that the first season focused more on the ""blended family"" meshing together.",1489104000,,493,4.64367816091954
