8048323,5,B0007LPT4Y,"I would have to say that the American Teenage population has completely misjudged the series. We all thought Yu-Gi-Oh was another version of Pokemon-stupid, pathetic, and a first class merchandise distributor. I was like them, for a time. That was, until I got my hands on the `original' series of Yu-Gi-Oh. The un-cut version is completely different from the Four Kids edited version. While the other one was designed to fit younger viewers, the un-cut version will surely inspire anyone who is beyond the age of twelve. This product is rated 13 and up for mild language, blood and gore, religious implications, death, some scary moments and human sacrifice (most of these differences appear in the later edition, such as Battle City and the Doma Arc). Of course, the version I currently own is the Anime Video ""AV"" series-, which has poorly manufactured subtitles and some cut-off episodes. These professional episodes are well done, and the USA Voice Actors seem to be doing a lot better (not the best job, but certainly better than the blasted cut) than I had originally believed they would.

The reason this DVD is taking so long to come out is due to the fact that Funimation has delayed its release date.  I personally tried to pick one up on the 'original' date (April 2005, I believe) but was dismayed when I found out that the store I went to didn't carry it.  I then learned (for some 'mysterious' reason) that Funimation is hesitating.  I suppose their sales on the other Un-Cut DVDs are not going as swimmingly as they had originally predicted.

Anyway, now for the actual DVD.  The so-called ""Give Up the Ghost"" episode is completely different in its original (and might I add, ""Glorious"") version.  NO!  That blob-like excuse for a man had absolutely NOTHING to ""do"" with Kaiba Seto.  In this version, he was ""not"" his evil counterpart but rather a disguise master hired by Pegasus (who even dressed up as Pegasus at one point once he was revealed) to deceive Mutou Yuugi.

That is mainly the only difference (other than the fact that Mai is on her third voice actor and Rex/Ryuzaki is on his second--Geese!) that is 'worth' mentioning on this particular DVD (there are other changes, just minor ones that I don't have the time nor the patience to mention), but don't worry. Just watch the 'original' Japanese track and you can't go wrong. ^_^

Anyway, I, among many other YGO fans worldwide, are hoping that this DVD will reign supreme over the other uncuts. Each one of them has had at least one draw back, but they do seem to be getting better with each new edition.  In addition, since Funimation has delayed its debut in the market, we can only hope that it will be better!",1119830400,3,2693,4.706382978723404
