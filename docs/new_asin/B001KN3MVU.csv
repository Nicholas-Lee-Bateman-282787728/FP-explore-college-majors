8315476,3,B001KN3MVU,"The methods presented are good. I dinged it two stars for two reasons: First, the term ""word wrap"" is not used; instead the term ""auto return"" is used. Standard educational textbooks and curriculum along with certification tests do not recognize the term ""auto return"" but ""word wrap"" instead. The other thing is the zoom is too large. It was difficult to watch follow along because you had a hard time finding the button.

with that said, I want to join the author in saying this would be great tool for use in the classroom as an introduction to Word 2007. He does very well at transferring the concepts of the old ""tool bars and menus"" to the ""ribbons, tabs, and groups"".",1238371200,2,674,4.570247933884297
