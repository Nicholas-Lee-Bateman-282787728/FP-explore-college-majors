8416477,5,B00453NTV0,"This is a gorgeous 1999 film, a re-telling of Pushkin's novel, ""The Captain's Daughter,"" set in 1773-1775 during the time of the Pugachev Rebellion against Catherine the Great.  This is primarily a love story and as such, is not an epic battle-by-battle account of the rebellion.  There are two sieges and a few skirmishes.  The end result, however, is epic.  The acting is worthy, the costuming and period set-pieces are spot-on and the human interest should keep you watching from start to finish.  The film is in Russian with English subtitles.  Ironically, I was in Samara and along the Samara Bend in Russia in 1999 and saw a replica of one of Pugachev's forts as well as his flag in a museum, but did not learn of this movie until 15 years later.  Recommended.",1415404800,2,766,4.6716417910447765

8416479,1,B00453NTV0,"Unfortunately when the Dvd of The Captain's Daughter arrived it wasn't even in a DVD case.
And when watched it wouldn't even play to the end because of the poor quality of the disc it had been burned onto.
The movie had to be reburned to a better quality disc of our own to be able to watch the end of the movie.
Very disapointed in receiving a Dvd that was well paid for only to recieve a burned copy",1344124800,4,401,4.025
8416480,5,B00453NTV0,I'd been looking for this film for 2 years for my son and I was glad to find one that could be viewed in France ! I had it sent to his home address and my daughter-in-law confirmed that it could be viewed. It will be a Chrismas present.,1291852800,,236,3.836734693877551
8416481,4,B00453NTV0,"Why is this movie so hard to find? It's very good- I watched it with my college Russian club, and was really amazed by the quality of the cinematography and depth of the storytelling. Pushkin would be pleased. For a recent big-budget Russian film, I've had an awfully difficult time securing a copy. If you can get your hands on this DVD, grab it.",1133222400,6,347,4.4375
