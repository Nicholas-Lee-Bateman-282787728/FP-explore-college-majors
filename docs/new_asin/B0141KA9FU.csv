8729265,1,B0141KA9FU,As others that posted a review.  I was very disappointed with this video.  There is only creepy music playing throughout with snippets of old haunt films.  There are no instructions or 'how to' sections throughout the entire video.  The title is misleading.,1505606400,,257,5.0476190476190474
8729266,2,B0141KA9FU,I thought this was a movie BUT found out it's just scary sound's so if you think this IS a movie like I did don't buy this BUT if you want scary sound's for Halloween then this IS for you.,1478390400,,188,3.725

8729273,2,B0141KA9FU,It's cool but the scenes don't last long enough. They are meant to be like those Fireplace scene videos made for Christmas. But because they flip the scenes too fast the scare is just not there.,1471564800,,194,4.416666666666667
