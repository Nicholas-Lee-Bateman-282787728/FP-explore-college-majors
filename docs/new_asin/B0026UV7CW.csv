8353615,1,B0026UV7CW,"Here is yet another example of a big studio (in this case Fox) rushing out ""Blu-ray"" versions of neo-classic films just to capitalize (i.e., make a buck) on a new technology. While true 1080p Blu-ray can produce stunning high-resolution video and sound some studios have taken shortcuts in order to rush their product onto the market. DON'T BE FOOLED, these discs CAN NOT truly convey 1080p resolution because they have been transferred using older codec (MPEG-2) technology resulting in discs that are only slightly better than standard definition (480p) DVDs and are ""Blu-ray"" in name only. Fox is one of the more egregious purveyors of these imposters and are now packaging them together in an apparent bargain.

Now, if you are a fan of these films, don't already own the DVDs and would like to add them to your Blu-ray collection at a reasonable price then by all means do so. They do offer, for now, the highest (if only slightly) resolution versions of these films available but if, like me, you already own the DVDs and simply wanted to upgrade to Blu-ray save your money. The Criterion Collection DVD of 'Silence of the Lambs' (now out of print) offered video quality comparable to this Blu-ray disc and has far more ""extras"" including an outstanding voice-over track with Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Director Jonathan Demme and the newer 2-Disc DVD has a new 5.1 surround track. The one nice thing about the 'Donnie Darko' Blu-ray disc is the inclusion of both the Theatrical and Director's Cut versions of the film. Other than that I can't recommend this disc over the 2-Disc Director's Cut DVD of 'Darko'. But for those who are waiting for the true 1080p Blu-ray versions of these films you'll have to wait until the studio deigns to release them ... whenever. Most likely after these dollar store, bargain bundles have run their course and the studio is looking to make some more dough.",1243555200,21,1905,4.825688073394495
