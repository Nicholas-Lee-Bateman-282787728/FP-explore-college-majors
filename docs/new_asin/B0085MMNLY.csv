Seeing those same Kiowa Indians killing a poor old Buffalo made me wonder what old Charles was thinking when he allowed them to do that.  Then I remembered that this was 1916, it was a different time and a different way of life.  We do the same thing with cattle but only see those nice cuts of meat in the grocery store.  Those Ribeyes, T-bones, and Sirloins come from somewhere.
It's worth viewing.  I've been trying to find a DVD of the film for a while now but can't find one.  I've even been trying to find one to download and can't find one either.  Am I the only one in this solar system that wants a copy of this film?",1366848000,,855,4.152439024390244
