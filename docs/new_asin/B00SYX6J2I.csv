6994852,5,B00SYX6J2I,"At last!
Shaun and the gang are my absolutely favorite animated characters.  Someone told me they are actually animated characters and aren't real.  Baloney!  I know they are real.  They are real to me!  By the way, I am 63-years old.  Shaun is real, just like when Bill Waterston's Calvin and Hobbes are playing and there are no adults around.

Besides the wonderful animation, story, sets, music, costumes, and ""dialogue"" in this film, the thing that sets it apart is its soul.  Although the sheep get into all sorts of mischief, they are never mean spirited about anything they do.  ""Sheep just want to have fun!""  Once their shenanigans backfire and they are in real trouble, they all work together, the sheep, Bitzer, the rooster -- even the pigs clean up after themselves -- to fix the problem.  There is real affection amongst and between all the members of the farm.

The story takes on some unexpected twists, and the ""next"" thing isn't always what one might expect.  When Shaun hatches various plans, you know he is up to something, but it isn't obvious, and you must wait until the plan comes to fruition and find out about it as it happens.  Most animated films are way too predictable in this way.  Shaun is not, and that is a real credit to the folks at Aardman.

Certainly, children -- of all ages -- will love this film, but there is a lot for adults, too.  Lots of parodies of other film characters and famous situations -- I want to describe some of it, but I will not spoil it.

Even Trumper the animal catcher -- and their nemesis -- isn't really all that bad.  He is just power hungry, so he rules his animal ""jail"" with an iron hand.

The fact that there is no dialogue in this movie or in any of the TV episodes is a plus, because the visuals are absolutely remarkable.  Dialogue would only mess it up.  It is like a Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd silent film with both slapstick and pathos -- but in color.  Also, it is just the right length -- about 81 minutes.

Go see it in the theater, and when the Region 1 DVD comes out -- get it.  I love films of all kinds, and I already rate this is one of my favorites.  Now, I am going to watch it again and catch some of the things I missed.

My only complaint about this movie -- Where is Pidsley?

PS -- Be sure to watch all the way through the credits!  Check out the ""extras"" -- they are short and have a clever surprise.

6994853,4,B00SYX6J2I,"After being tired of the same routine every day; Shaun and the other sheep rebel against the farmer. Putting him to sleep in his trailer so they can party and watch tv; goes horribly wrong. So it's up to Shaun and the others to make things right when the farmer goes missing. However; they have to escape a crazed animal catcher first.
  I took my nieces to see Shaun the Sheep; expecting to be bored but I laughed out loud more than once. The movie's humor almost feels old fashioned; like something from a Chaplin movie. That's despite some mild crude humor. While the movie is also charming, clever and even touching at times.
  I strongly recommend Shaun the Sheep. The film makes for strong competition for Inside Out at the Oscars. I wouldn't even mind if won. Disney and Pixar can't count their Oscars by now anyway.",1438819200,,823,4.54054054054054

It is infinitely sweet, infinitely creative, infinitely funny, and truly a work of art. The work required to make even 5 minutes of claymation is phenomenal & must require the patience of a saint. These modest Brits have ruined me for what passes as comedy, animation, & story line here in the U.S. You won't find an animated movie that surpasses the heart of this film.

It's incredibly rare nowadays to see a movie with little to no dialogue.  But that became my favorite trait of the film.  Communicating with just groans, or progressing the story with drawings on a chalkboard forces you to watch the movie more closely.  This isn't a movie you can pop in and go do the dishes, you really need to sit on your couch and do nothing else but watch.  At no point does the story drag or do you yawn from being bored, the movie keeps going from beginning to end.  At times, certain elements seem a little far fetched, but then you realize you're watching a movie where sheep are conducting science experiments.

Shaun The Sheep is not material for a movie, in my opinion.  It has the flavor of a sequel to a successful movie:  More of the same, stretched.

I think the series is a tremendous work of art, but the movie is not.

Is it enjoyable?  Yes.  But the series is the right format.

For me it is equivalent to liking Limoncello and just having this all night.

6995172,3,B00SYX6J2I,"Shaun the Sheep is probably the most entertaining children's program around. Like many of the best it has references to concepts over the heads of most children that are hysterical to the parents. The problem with the STS Movie is that it seems less like an extension of the program than a reimmagining. It's darker and a bit mean spirited and the material just seems stretched a bit too far for a feature length film. It's still good and yes the kids love it, not as much the adults. Hopefully now the movie is done  we'll get a new series.",1484697600,,541,4.41

With that in mind... you get an MPEG-4 AVC coded Blu-ray with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. It's good quality video and it will fill your TV screen. The sound is equally as good which you would expect from a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.

Background music and various noises are as much as you will get with this movie though. I mention this specifically because I see another reviewer marked the movie right down because there was no dialogue which I consider a little unfair as there's not meant to be. Shaun is effectively a dialogue free zone. As a result there are no subtitles either.

In a nutshell it looks good and sounds good.

Where this offering loses a star for me is the fact that this was bought brand new from Amazon on 11/25/2016. The listing quite clearly has it as ""Shaun the Sheep Movie [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD]."" It was a Christmas stocking filler and so it didn't get opened until 12/25/2016. That's when I found out that the digital copy expired 11/24/2016 - the day before I bought it - so even if I had opened it straight away it would have already expired.

I understand an invalid code is a distinct possibility when buying used but this was brand new and from Amazon. So be warned if you are expecting to extend your UV collection as well when buying this.",1483488000,,1475,4.368613138686132

We own a season of Shaun the Sheep shows to show to young visitors that come to our home.  The entire concept is such a well done performance of stop-action animation.  There is not one spoken word and yet you can tell exactly what is going on in the minds of the sheep, the farmer, the dog, the pigs, and any other person and/or animal that comes in the storyline.  This is brilliantly done by the grunts and wordless calls of the humans, by the various animal sounds of the animals and by the detailed facial expressions by all.  The story had my wife, my 2-year old grandaughter and I in stitches for the entire length of the movie.  I would recommend this for all ages - and especially all ages to watch this movie together.",1478908800,,823,4.177215189873418

6995924,5,B00SYX6J2I,"An extremely witty children's movie with bonuses and references aplenty for adults as well, and done entirely in the manner of silent films - no dialogue at all, beyond a bit of Simglish and animal noises.  Besides, your heart would have to be made of cold granite not to mist up a bit at the ""Baabaashop Quartet"" scene late in the movie.

For those who haven't seen the equally witty series, Shaun's the leader of a flock of oddball sheep; he's quite smart for a sheep, but his plans nearly always get his flock into trouble.  One day, bored with the routine of the farm, he concocts a plan to give everyone a ""day off"".  Of course, the plan goes hilariously wrong, leaving their beloved farmer stranded in the Big City with a case of amnesia, and it's up to Shaun and his loyal flock to get him back.  Along the way, they have to learn the ways of the human world, try and ""blend in"", and dodge an Inspector Javert animal control officer who takes his job, way, *WAY* too seriously...

Unqualifiedly recommended.",1478736000,,1014,4.483695652173913

The beauty is that you provide your own dialogue as to how the character actions translate to you. Incredible idea. What I think they said, and what you might think they said can be completely different, hence any age can read into it what they want and not be told what to think. Does a map exist showing that Mrs. Tweedy's farm is two counties over, or that Bitzer is Grommits 3rd cousin twice removed on his nephews side? Call me sentimental, but the episode from the series where all of the animals get together to stop the farmer from cutting down their tree for firewood, gets to me every time.",1476144000,,747,4.54074074074074

My 4 year old son has taken up the mantle and we were so excited about the spin off series and subsequent feature film. He initially questioned why there was no dialogue  but quickly became immersed in the story, delightfully conveyed, and realized that no words were necessary! My son is on the spectrum and I love that he has to really watch the facial expressions and gestures to derive the meaning. I don't want to reveal plot points but the a""baa""pella musical number was so well executed that it brought a tear to my eye. It's so great that stop-motion animation can actually be relevant in 2015 and even rival Inside Out as my son's favorite movie, a total triumph.",1475107200,,754,4.544117647058823

Some of the humor was a little basic although on a very mild level but, kids love that type of humor.
One reviewer commented that it was not Claymation but digital I did not find that noticeable but it may be on a bigger screen however, it would probably not have been a financially viable option to use Claymation on a full length movie.
As a Brit in the US I think some American audiences may miss the short bursts of very specific British humor in places, I'm sure I missed a few that is another reason I shall watch it again however, missing too many of those specific moments may make the movie less enjoyable for some.
There are many nods to well known famous movies which whilst beyond children should amuse most adults.
I am a great fan of everything involving Nick Parks and his studios and for me he hits the mark virtually every time.
To me the sign of a well thought out movie of this type is that it can be interesting to both adults and children on separate levels by containing an adult humor that is too obscure for children to understand, I believe this technique evolved as the result of a need to work around the draconian censorship in the early Brit entertainment industry

6996585,4,B00SYX6J2I,"Our whole family, from Baby to Grandma, enjoy Shaun the Sheep antics. This movie was a little too intense for my 4 year old - he ran from the room a couple of times. If your child is used to watching movies with super heroes and villains, he/she might not be so affected.
In the series, the biggest adversary faced is either the pigs, possibly the bull, or sometimes the farmer's incompetence. In the movie, where the farmer has amnesia in The Big City, the gang faces a sadistic dog catcher, and an amnesic farmer.
There were moments when I was hooting with laughter, and where I was catching cultural references / gags that went over my little one's head.

If you intend this for a pre-school age kid, Id recommend watching it with him/her first. Its not like the regular series where you can turn on any episode and be confident that its gentle and appropriate.",1474243200,,864,4.503184713375796

6996940,5,B00SYX6J2I,"It is amazing how, with essentially no language, this wonderful animated movie tells a (come to think of it) rather complicated story.  Shaun the Sheep has become bored with his routine, though comfortable, life on the farm.  He sees an ad on a passing bus and decides to strike out for a bit of adventure. He has to enlist the cooperation of fellow sheep to ensure that his (kindly) farmer ""boss"" doesn't prevent him from embarking on his journey.  He doesn't know just how involved that journey will become, not only for him, but for his sheep friends and the farmer, as well!  There are so many visual amusements that it's difficult to catch them all in one viewing. Kids waching would be fine, but adults who aren't too sophisticated for their own good will enjoy it even more.  Watch it when you need to lighten up; it's charmingly funny.",1473033600,,843,4.593333333333334

We watched it on demand on a whim one day after spending the day at a waterpark and were waiting for pizza and needed some winding down and we saw this and figured, what the heck. We were fans of Wallace and Grommit and liked Chicken Run, so figured it could not be too bad. I have yet to be able to sit and watch it from start to finish but the best I can figure is the dog and farmer and sheep are tired of their daily routine so the sheep put the farmer back to sleep by having him count them as they jumped over a fence, shut him into an old camper, and then had fun in the house until the dogs came home. Pigs somehow got in the house and locked the sheep out (I missed part of that) and when the dog gets the sheep to show him where the farmer is, they end up sending the trailer/camper thing flying into town and the farmer ends up in the hospital with ""memory loss"". The dog is not allowed in to the hospital so he waits and the sheep end up in the town looking for the farmer and dress up like people and  hilarity ensues. My 4, 6, and 8-year olds were just howling and even the almost 2-year old thinks it is funny in places. There are no words, just Charlie Brown-esque adult mumbling.

I have watched all the series and other connect media regarding Shaun the Sheep and this is by far the worst installment. The other media productions are smart, fun, and include comic genius. I have not met a kid or adult that could not appreciate the various products. This particular movie is predictable and provides very little comic moments. It seems as if no one put any thought into making this a story with substance. I cited the fact that the movie begins like ground hog day. The sheep, in particular, Shaun are bored with the regular routine. They put the farmer in the trailer and of course he ends up in the city. He is fine until he gets amnesia. The villain is the dog catcher and he rounds up Shaun, Bitzer, and a new character that may be a dog, but I could not vouch for that without an autopsy. The wind blows the medical sheet for the farmer to their temporary hideout and they realize the farmer has amnesia. This alerts the gang to why he did not recognize them when he was found in the salon cutting hair. And from there the story is typical. If you have seen the trailer you have seen the movie. I love series and various other installments even Wallace and Grommit, but this production is a scam. I purchased it for my birthday and was very disappointed.",1463875200,,1365,4.377952755905512

6997510,1,B00SYX6J2I,"So I was watching this on cable. Not bad, not great, but my animated taste runs to RICK and MORTY or ARCHER and this was a little 2 cutesy pie for me. Then, I met the villain. An animal control nazi who locks up animals in cages after capturing them with an electrified shock gun that looks like something Wile E. Coyote would order from Acme. He has shifty eyes, an evil laugh, smirks a lot. You know the drill. He obviously hates all critters, except sheep in women's clothes, who he is strangely attracted too btw. Don't worry folks, it's all P.G. here and I started to perk up and pay more attention to this oddball character. Suddenly he whips out his business card and presents it to a fugitive sheep (in women's clothes) and what is his name? ""A. TRUMPER"". What the heyyy? Are you kidn me? Did they manage to slip that into this flick & nobody notices it... Or have I just been watching to much politics on T.V.?  Please somebody, set me straight. Was Donald Trump on the radar screen when they were making this movie? Is this a tongue in cheek slam at his supporters, or does ""A. TRUMPER"" mean something else in England? They obviously wanted the audience to see that this no goodnick guy was ""A. TRUMPER' because his name was prominently shown on screen more than once. But, was Trump already being vilified that long ago? Right now (May 18  2016) Trump is a hot topic in the U.K. and is being heavily criticized by P.M. David Cameron & the new muslim mayor of London (although celeb author J.K. Rowling seems to think he's a great guy). So, are Trump supporters in England called ""Trumpers"" and equated with being cruel to animals? Are they universally disliked by most Britons? (Mr A Trumper winds up in a pile of bull poop at the end of the movie) Or...Am I just imagining this and it's some weird coincidence in political timing. Anyone know when this movie went into production... and where?  Is this a U.S. flick made Hollywood perhaps? I gave the movie 1 star just to get your attention btw.

6997519,4,B00SYX6J2I,"I had a two track reaction.  Theres no question this is a terrific kid's movie.  But as an adult fan of much of Aardman animation - and as someone unfamiliar with the Shaun the Sheep TV show - I was a bit disappointed, as this was more squarely aimed at young kids, with less of a crossover appeal than I'm used to.

Thats not really a 'criticism', since I think this would be great for a 6 year old, but it lacked the level of sophistication and wild imagination I assumed would be there for old 50+ me.  That said, there are a few laugh out loud bits, and a number of smile inducing ones.  But with no dialogue, this is more reliant than I personally respond to on old silent slapstick gags that were done better in live action 90 years ago (or in cartoons 60 years ago by Tex Avery).

A small flock of sheep are bored silly with their daily routine, so they try to engineer a breakout for the day.  But things backfire, and the kindly farmer that owns them is caught in a runaway airstream trailer, carried to the big city, and bonked on the head, leading to a loss of memory.  So the flock, and the loyal farm-dog, venture separately to the city to try and find and rescue their farmer.  The stop-motion animation is as good as ever, and I had fun watching it.  Its sweet and goodhearted.  Just not the kind of sharp, smart, witty grown-up fun Ive gotten from Wallace and Grommit, or Chicken Run or Creature Comforts.",1462665600,,1421,4.284644194756554

6997536,3,B00SYX6J2I,"Disappointing that they went computer animated, instead of sticking with the claymation / stop-motion of the series.  It took some of the depth away from the characters and their expressions and makes some things look and feel weird.  I've watched every one of the series on Amazon Prime 8-10 times each because young kids.  In the episodes, you accept some of the very unrealistic depictions of everyday items because you of the limitations of the medium (clay), but here the limitations are now artificially (and selectively) imposed.  You get weird looking depictions of items next items that were not even attempted to be simulated clay when they would have been in the series. Computer simulated claymation either needs to be done better and more consistently or not at all.  It's just so odd to me that anyone would take a medium with very few limitations (computer animation) to simulate a medium that has to be one of the most challenging due to its severe limitations. (It may be that Chicken Run or others used similar methods, but something about their use here looked strongly artificial.)

No spoiler summary:

The movie itself is good for a good number of laughs for both kids and adults alike, just like the series.  The story is well-written and well-executed, but stretches too little material over too long a runtime.  The primary antagonist in the movie was good for a few laughs early, but then just gets weary.  You know the sheep will elude, win and defeat after doing it multiple times to the same adversary.  It feels a little bit like it could have been told more enjoyably in 2-3 of their typical 10-minute episodes instead of a feature length film.  Maybe it's just that I am so accustomed to the discipline seen in the episodes with each story neatly wrapped up and status quo reestablished every ten minutes.

In all, we watched this movie about one and a half times, and the adults and kids alike would rather watch well-worn episodes we've seen a dozen times over this. Somehow it feels like ""been there done that"" after barely more than one viewing unlike the episodes do.

For folks looking for a laugh similar to Chicken Run or other British animated gems, I would rate this slightly lower than them even for a single viewing, but still highly watchable and memorable.  Do yourself a favor and try to watch the episodes as well.  They are absolutely incredible for originality, consistency and good-hearted, no-cheap-laughs fun.

Back to the beginning of this review -- I just couldn't get past the computer animated claymation.  It seems pointless -- somewhat like the  obsession with playing ""8-bit"" games on a device capable of shooting and displaying 4k video -- the nostalgia points wear off and you're just left with an expression-limiting medium.  I love animation and have enjoyed what seems like a second golden age of animation we are in with Big Hero 6, Frozen, Despicable Me, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, etc. demonstrating incredible talent and use of technology.

Overall, I give the story 5 stars minus for being dragged out and minus another star for the animation issues.",1462147200,,3128,4.842105263157895

6997714,5,B00SYX6J2I,"This is a wonderful story of how the farm animals and the farmer take their routines for granted, but in the end they discover joy in the friendships they share.

The story starts by establishing how the animals and the farmer are in a bit of ruts.

Shaun wants to mix things up and decides to head to the big city.

They have to take the farmer out of commission for a bit, and this is where the plan goes awry.  The farmer ends up getting hit in the head and taken to the hospital where he suffers from amnesia.

The flock has a daring adventure in the big city trying to find and recover the farmer.

The main villain this time is an animal control officer.

The farmer uses his sheep shearing skills to develop a new haircut that catches on like wildfire.

In the end though, it is love and friendship that brings the farmer's memory and the farm animals back together.

This is a lovely story, and as a bonus there are more Hollywood movie references embedded in the tale than you can shake a lamb's tail at!

I highly recommend this movie!",1455580800,4,1045,4.285714285714286

This movie is boring. The fact that none of the characters speak should have been a clue that Shaun the Sheep would have limited potential. I guess, when you're a movie critic and do nothing but watch movies all day, every day, you get tired of the formulas. Then you get a movie like this one that reminds you of the old silent pictures you watched in film school, a formula you haven't seen in years, you get warm inside and give it a good review. If this and The Pirates! are the trajectory of Aardman animation, I'll probably skip anything else they put out.",1454544000,2,729,4.328467153284672

Shaun gets a bit bored with farm routine but his efforts to gain a day off lead to near disaster with the flock, Bitzer and the farmer ending up in Big City. Theres a complication or two, leading to the farmer taking on a new career and a rescue or two needed. Its all done as usual with no speaking and its admirable how the creators still convey so much through gesture and expression. The key is the wonderful clay-animation style of Aardman and the likeability of the characters. There is a slightly darker side brought by the films antagonist, which goes a bit far for very little kids. My five year old charge was quite scared at times but my four year old was fine? There is a somewhat nasty element but I think it was just a bit loud in these spots. This aside, the soundtrack was great with a few of the tunes likely to stick in your head for days. So too will some of the amusing images, some specifically for the grown-ups. All together this was very entertaining and enjoyable film.

6997787,5,B00SYX6J2I,"If only more animated films were as creative and entertaining as this! Believe it or not, despite being aware of them for a long time, this is the first Aardman feature I've ever seen. The plot for SHAUN THE SHEEP is a very simple one: Bored with the routine at the farm, Shaun and his friends trick the Farmer into having the day off (kind of), but he gets lost in the big city and Shaun & Co must go find and rescue their beloved owner. I suppose the first thing you should know is that this movie has no intelligible dialogue whatsoever, making it kind of a silent film. People who rely heavily on speaking and exposition to guide them through a story may find this irksome, but I thought it worked rather well. The pacing is really good and there's always a gag of some sort to make you laugh. Of course, Aardman aren't above toilet humor, and those handful of gags were probably the reason for the PG rating. Aside from being a funny film that will appeal to children and adults, though, it works in some subtle commentary on our technology and social media-obsessed society. After the Farmer gets a knock on the head and temporarily loses his memory in the Big City, he inadvertently becomes an internet sensation by giving people haircuts in the style he used on his sheep. There's also plenty of other visual cues, as nearly everyone in the city is on a mobile device of some kind. While not really delivering a message, per se, it would be hard not to come away from this with the feeling that maybe we've lost ourselves in the hustle and bustle of modern life and need to occasionally unplug and enjoy the simpler pleasures of friends and family. So, the film is definitely on solid thematic ground. The only place where it falters a little bit is resorting to the usual action climax. It leads there naturally, but the plot had begun to lose a little bit of steam by that point. Fortunately, it never wore out its welcome, and concluded in heartwarming fashion. I should also mention that I loved the music, which included both original tunes (I think) and previously existing songs. There's even a couple of a movie references/homages for the film buffs in the audience. Overall, while not completely perfect, it's about as perfect as can be and is a refreshing reminder that there's still room in today's crowded, CGI animation-dominated landscape for lovingly crafted Claymation like this.",1454112000,,2403,4.616822429906542
6997788,4,B00SYX6J2I,"From a technical side, you can tell it was much lower budget. 2012's 'The Pirates' was made in beautiful 3D and had detailed imagery, but the characters and story were terribly lame, (so was Flushed Away), so, even though Shaun the Sheep is a little cheaper, it's a good story with very clever humor, and a true return to form since their last genuinely good movie in 2005.",1454025600,,373,4.5

Since there are no spoken words, you have to 'think' about what the characters are saying or feeling or trying to convey through their looks and body language.  One of our grandsons has Autism.  Its super fun to be with him, because he knows Shaun and the gang really well from watching Seasons 1-5 on Amazon Prime.  He 'talks' the character's parts...he says what they are thinking.  It's been really helpful for him because he has to watch and think...then verbalize.  This Nana and Papa love Shaun the Sheep, not only the movie, but all the series episodes.

It's always a shot in the dark when purchasing discs with Digital HD because there's no consistency in the terminology and always frustrating and a disappointment when an iTunes copy isn't made available.",1453507200,,520,4.853932584269663

6997828,4,B00SYX6J2I,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I am a long-time fan of stop motion animation. Having grown up in the days when the name Ray Harryhausen was something that inspired thoughts of a great time at the movies there was little chance that anyone from that time could not. When the characters of Wallace and Gromit came along I was fascinated and laughed out loud at their antics. When Aardman Studios made CHICKEN RUN and THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT I made a point of seeing them and having a good time as well. That tradition carries on with this release.

I was unaware of the series this movie was based on and now intend to find copies of it on DVD. The story revolves around two friends, a dog named Bitzer and a sheep named Shaun. Living on Mossy Bottom Farm with the farmer and other animals they live a contented life. But Shaun wants to do something different than the daily routine. To do so he has to distract the attention of the Farmer. Things get out of hand, the Farmer ends up bopped on the head developing a case of amnesia and is carted off to the hospital.

With the Farmer gone things are different and okay for a spell but that all changes when the pigs take over his house. Shaun soon realizes how good he had it and recruits Bitzer and his fellow sheep to go in search of the Farmer to return him home. One way or another they reach the city having adventures along the way only to find the Farmer has walked out of the hospital on his own, still having no clue who he is.

Again, a number of adventures follow and to describe each would not only take time but ruin the fun viewers will have watching this movie. Suffice to say each one is hilarious and doesnt rush into presenting the jokes but lets them slowly unwind as a good comedy should. And more than just a stop-motion animated feature this movie is indeed a comedy and quite a good one at that. So much so that the film has been nominated for best animated feature film for this years (2015) Oscars.

The movie is such a treat that I know children will love watching what happens from moment to moment. Its one of those films that will have them laughing and capture their attention for the full running time. Better yet it will have the same effect on adults as well.

Ive read that another feature is in the works and that puts a smile on my face and not one that is off kilter a bit like the one on Shauns. The movie will leave you laughing, will touch your heart and will entertain you from start to finish. What more could you ask for from a film? Big studio CGI animated features will probably dominate the awards but when it comes to creativity and heart, this movie from the little studio that could is well worth not just watching but adding to your shelf.",1453334400,,2767,4.291187739463601

6997848,3,B00SYX6J2I,"I have to give the disclaimer that Shaun the Sheep is a great television show, it comes from Fletcher who is brilliant and the creative team behind almost all of the various character are fantastic.  However, this Shaun the Sheep movie seemed sort of phoned in...I hate to say that and I may delete it before I'm done.  Still there so I guess I didn't have a change of heart.  My daughters (7 & 4) were very excited to watch the movie and we made the decision to buy it without watching previews or reading much about it because we enjoy the shows so much.  In the end, I think the movie just doesn't live up to what you can see in the television show and we all felt it was a little off the mark.  I am glad we own it and supported the movie because good/great family films and filmmakers need to be encouraged but the story was a little weak (amnesia and fish out of water) followed by a cast of characters that we already love being one dimensional and ending with a villain that is more wiley coyote (though a little more sadistic) than anything relatable.  I don't mean to be overly harsh but we expected more...I feel like I just kicked a puppy in my review.",1452988800,9,1164,4.244343891402715

This movie has an adorable plot and stays true to the characters and flow of the actual show, which we appreciated. The animation is well done and, true to Shaun the Sheep form, theres less talk and more emoting and ""acting"" through facial and body expression which we find refreshing. It keeps the attention of both our 2 year old and our 4 year old (about half the time with our 2 year old attributed to his age and that we don't watch a whole lot of tv or movies for that matter).
My husband I also had a lot of fun watching this movie as its both humorous and has a well timed plot.

Shaun lives on a farm with a dog and other sheep and a loving and kind farmer. Chaos ensues when Shaun decides to go on vacation. Well, the farmer ends up with amnesia and becomes a world acclaimed hair stylist while a nasty animal control officer tries to capture the sheep who have gone into town.
Here is where it all goes wrong. The humans only mumble so gone is the delightful facial movements seen as Wallace talked in the other films. There is nothing exciting or inspiring--well, maybe the ending makes up for a lot of the film.
Aardman does wonders with animation and somehow there just was nothing new in this film. It actually took me three nights to finish as I hoped there would be some end to my disappointment. There wasn't, unfortunatetly.",1448841600,,1003,4.640449438202247
6997986,5,B00SYX6J2I,"If you have kids and don't already know about Shaun the Sheep, run (don't walk) to the nearest source for the TV show and introduce it to your kids. It's done in Claymation style by the Wallace and Grommit folks, and concerns the goings-on at a rural English farm.

There's the farmer, of course, and his faithful dog (Bitzer), who, together, attempt to run the place. The main characters are Shaun and the rest of the flock of sheep. There are also some piggish pigs and a bullish bull, as well as a voracious goat, a loquacious rooster, and various other farm-related characters.

One conceit of the show is that none of the characters speak intelligibly - all communication is done either visually or through grunts, exclamations, and/or gibberish whose tone is meant to convey contextual meaning. Describing it on paper (or pixels) does it poor justice, as it is a creative and endearing method to remove language barriers while allowing the animals all to communicate without becoming fully anthropomorphized.

In this film, the action moves to the big city, where all the primary characters from the TV show have an exciting adventure. The story is serious enough to be engaging, silly enough to be relatively harmless, and funny enough for adults to enjoy alongside their kids.

Highly recommended, and I hope this is the first of many such films. Well done.",1448841600,,1365,4.870689655172414

6997998,4,B00SYX6J2I,"Ever since I was a little kid, I've been a fan of Wallace and Gromit, both in it's stop motion clay animation as well as its laid back humor. And when the cute little sheep from ""A Close Shave"" got his own spin off TV show, I hopped right on it, and fell in love with Shaun's nutty antics and his adorable band of barnyard friends. So imagine my surprise when I saw a trailer for a feature length movie starring Shaun and the gang. You can bet I was excited to see it. But due to limited release in the U.S., it wouldn't be until it came to DVD that I finally got to see it.

The verdict? While it definitely helps to have seen the TV show beforehand, this is still a very cute and funny film that any family can and will enjoy.

Shaun the sheep lives on a farm in a sleepy little town out in the country, somewhere in the UK. He and his flock of animal friends are watched over and taken care of by Bitzer, the sheep dog, and his owner, The Farmer (who goes unnamed). But the day to day boring schedule of the farm begins to wear on Shaun and his friends, to which they hatch a scheme to get the dog and the farmer out of the way so they can enjoy a day off. But when a series of mishaps causes The Farmer to be swept away to the big city, it's up to Shaun, Bitzer, and the rest of the gang to get him back...and in time, they learn that their quiet life on the farm isn't so bad after all, especially when a cruel animal control officer sets his sights on capturing the escaped flock.

If you seen any of Aardman Studio's previous works, such as ""Wallace and Gromit"" or ""Chicken Run"", then you have an idea of what you're in for in terms of animation. The artists really outdid themselves when it came to the fluid animation, lighting, and attention to detail--being able to pull off more epic set pieces that they couldn't do on the TV show (mainly for money and time constraints, I'm sure). For people who have watched the show, the movie is essentially one long, extended episode.

But even if you've never seen the TV series, this film can still stand well on its own. The plot is very simple, with one funny gag after the next as the animals make their way through the busy and strange city. And in classic cartoon fashion, their efforts to get back home cause all sorts of wacky chaos, with plenty of nods and references to classic films. But there's nothing in the way of pop culture jokes (at least, none that I could find), making the film fairly timeless.  The other huge point of interest is the fact that there's absolutely NO TALKING in the entire movie. There's a few inserted songs, but they're only used for montages. Other than that, the entire plot is told through pantomime. And no speaking is needed anyway. You can easily tell and/or figure out what's going on, or what the characters are thinking just by the great animation. I can think of no other movie that's like this--even Pixar's Wall-E can't boast that. This winds up making this a great film that can be played and enjoyed in any country, in any language around the world.

For audiences who are used to kids' films that are fast paced, with constant talking, and having the plot practically spelled out for you, this film is a welcome change of pace. It has no qualms about being laid back and taking its time; allowing the viewer to take in the scenery and figure out the story on their own, while also teaching lessons in teamwork and learning to appreciate the things you have in life....all while throwing in hilarious gags (the sequences in the restraunt and the horse costume had me in tears). I only hope that this movie's life on DVD will garner the attention it deserves (especially since Wallace and Gromit seems to be more popular). Definitely give this a watch; you'll be in for a very different, but still cute and funny treat.",1448409600,,3824,4.333798882681564

6998001,5,B00SYX6J2I,"At last, after  waiting for what seemed an eternity,  The home video of the Shaun the Sheep Movie adventure is in my home, playable my TVs.  What a great film,  It was worth the wait,  From the start,  where all the animal were shown  in their much younger days (Shaun the Lamb,  Bitzer the Pup, being given his little blue cap and the Farmer who looked as he was in his teens}  This was an amazing  film, because the basic message was ""Care for Each Other""  Shaun loses his way for a bit and  behaves  as if he was  a  ""kid""  and it takes  a shock to make him realize  how  ""oflal"" he's been misbehaving.  I won't spoil the  film by giving away the plot devices.  My advice is own  ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" DVD and  watch it as many times as you wish.  Children will enjoy the flock's  antics, but  adults will  also enjoy the film.  Anyone  who views  the movie and isn't  a part of the flock , by films end will be ""baaing"" for more and transformed into a Shaun  the Sheep dedicated fan.
One question, I have is why it is not captioned.  Granted, there is no dialogue, but captions would  make it much easier  for the hearing challenged to follow the storyline;  The  other videos in the Shaun Saga have captioning  and it's much easier  for the hard of hearing  to enjoy.",1448409600,,1274,4.206751054852321

I saw this movie in the summer with my brother and father, and it was awesome! They didn't like it as much, but I didn't care, what mattered was how I felt about it.

Kids love hilarious story with a twist and learn that we must help each when someone needs help. Well made with care for details, can be watched by anyone.

6998036,4,B00SYX6J2I,"This is a fantastic movie. It's amazing how a full-length movie with absolutely NO speech at all can be so entertaining. We've watched it twice and each time, it has entertained from 5 year olds all the way to adults!
There are so many tiny, quick moments or objects that you have to be really watching to catch, and the story moves pretty quickly, but slowly enough so that younger audiences can still follow.
The only reason I give it four stars out of five is because the villain, the dog-catcher, turns unnaturally evil towards the end of the movie. Also, for how cruel he was, I do not think he had just repercussions.
However, the movie is very funny and entertaining. I could do without some of the crude jokes, but overall the movie is very appropriate for ALL ages. Its main theme is gorgeous and very well displayed... you need to appreciate things that you take for granted that are very crucial to you and that you love, whether or not you realize it.

The sheep will have their challenge in the form of a grimly relentless enforcer from Animal Containment. The animation is priceless, the humor is most British, and the action builds steadily to a dramatic finish. The sight gags should vastly appeal to the adults in the audience while paying homage to a variety of movies, famously including ""Silence of the Lambs.""

6998042,5,B00SYX6J2I,"By far the most enjoyable ""children's film"" I have seen in years. The movie does a great job of telling a story without ever uttering one word of dialogue. The opening scene shows the connection formed over years between the farmer and his animals and sets the stage for the entire movie. The way this is done without any dialogue is masterful to say the least, and is aided greatly by a very catchy song (which will be stuck in your head). To sum it all up it is a great film for children or adults and is certainly better than the products churned out by Disney over the last few years. Give it a shot and I doubt you will be disappointed.",1446768000,,641,4.219512195121951
6998043,5,B00SYX6J2I,"For several months, I have been waiting for this movie. Shaun's story on a widescreen. One that would last, as I read on the Web, eighty-two minutes, which I think is a perfect length with no possible risks of any stretched out parts. So when this movie came out, I took the time to see it in the Cinema, and fortunately, my hopes were reassured. Shaun's second movie foray (counting ""The Close Shave"" with Wallace and Gromit) is a perfect treat.

An original episode set during a wonderful June day, this feature-length story offers us the chance to see our hero and his Mossy Bottom Farm flock do what they know best. Finding new ways to trick the farmer and have fun for the day, but this time comes a terrible consequence. Which is the loss of their master in the Big City; an unnamed location where animals on the run are the victims of a cruel animal containment employee, but where Shaun, his flock, and Bitzer, will try to get their master back. A story that ran the right length as I didn't felt bored, with enough visual irony to laugh at our society's codes  especially with social medias  and make us understand why Shaun and his flock would rather have fun than live the same routine. By the way, I adored Aardman's funny references to classics like Silence of the Lambs, for which the credits had to mention thanks to MGM for letting them use that nod, and even their legendary ""Morph"" series. Why, if you take a close look, its creator Nick Park even has a cameo during the movie. Personally, I found this really neat as this is the best thanks they could give to one of the key people behind Aardman; an artist whose humour, visual style, and storytelling brought success to Aardman and enriched British culture with his ""Wallace and Gromit"" universe. Though this time, we have a special intro at the beginning, which makes us wonder how Shaun's flock ever got involved with Ms. Ramsbottom and her dog Preston when the farmer had them first.

In its visuals, the animation is as top notch as its production design. Props with careful textures, imposing structures for the city, and an evolving lighting as the day passes, the Aardman studio exployees have really upped the notch in their art. And as for their characters' designs, they didn't revolve them like they did during the first two seasons. This time, they've kept to what we've had since the third season. A consistence that maintains the show's bible artwork.

For its sound, the Dolby 5.1 quality is perfect. Nothing too loud that could make people jump in fright, and careful sound effects when the animals move around their world, viewers have a better chance to immerse themselves in the story. And again, isn't it wonderful to have a movie that has not a single ounce of dialogue, but instead relies on its cast's body language, camera angles, and visuals rather than this persistent ""blah-blah-blah!"" Hollywood constantly crams in the industry and around the world. As if people were too dumb to understand characters through their actions and reactions.

Again, a wonderful work from Aardman studio, and a movie that reaffirms how claymation can still touch and move audiences.",1445472000,5,3161,4.727767695099819

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The big screen debut of Aardman Animations beloved TV character is a gloriously crackpot, silent comedy wonder. Everything is sheep shape in this cleverly off-kilter big-screen debut for Aardman Animations lovable farmyard adventurer. Only Aardman Animations, the British creators of Wallace & Gromit, Morph and other lovable Claymation moulded characters, could find an irresistible film in industrial amounts of clay and a story of an amnesiac farmer and his flock at loose in the big city.

Conventional wisdom may have it that sheep are supposedly the dumbest of all livestock, but the woolly ones wits get a collective sharpening in Shaun the Sheep Movie, a sweet-natured but cleverly off-kilter feature-length debut for Aardman Animations plucky farmyard hero. Retaining the gentle, non-verbal comedy and daffy sight gags of the popular stop-motion TV series which itself is a loose spinoff from Aardman Animations cherished Wallace and Gromit franchise. Here we find Shaun and his flock on an urban day out escapade that is more expansive than their usual short-form animation on TV.

Originally introduced 20 years ago in the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit outing in A Close Shave, but here the diminutive sheep Shaun has since headlined more than 100 miniature adventures for the small screen, each one cramming a complex degree of farce into a seven-minute running time, before returning affairs to a rustic status quo. In devising a feature narrative 12 times the length of any single episode, writer-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak have wisely kept a number of the series formal restrictions intact. Most cannily and crucially, the film remains dialogue-free, with the animals communicating solely through expression and gesture, while for example the human characters in something like the Peanuts franchise films and specials, that speak in unintelligible stupid gibberish.

The film opens with a tightly rhythmic montage and shot Super 8-style, illustrating the cheery daily grind at Mossy Bottom Farm, where the flock is tended by a balding, nameless human farmer and his bright, put-upon sheepdog Bitzer. As in every episode, the animals seek an escape from the mundane demands of farm labour, this time ingeniously sending the farmer to sleep via a live chain of fence-jumping. The snowballing sequence of mischief that follows sees him accidentally transported to the big city (London in all but name) and losing his memory.

Naturally, its Shaun and his bleating entourage, ranging from super-sized ewe Shirley to helpless lamb Timmy to the rescue, though its not long before they require rescuing themselves, with their arrival in town triggering unwanted attention from animal containment services. By way of apparent homage, the pic is a happy reminder that the critical rehabilitation of Babe: Pig in the City is complete. Meanwhile, their amnesia-afflicted master The Farmer has stumbled into an unlikely new career as a celebrity barber to moneyed urbanites: The current vogue for severely undercut hairstyles isn't a world away from sheep-shearing, after all. Complete with jabs at social-media marketing, this is one of the films few extended jokes likely to go over the collective heads of very young adults, but its the kind of absurdly exaggerated everyday detail and complete with the repurposing of familiar gadgetry, on which Aardman Animations comic brand is built upon. Other in-built games for adults include spotting various throwaway references to considerably less family-oriented films, like The Night of the Hunter and Scorseses Cape Fear included.

The animation itself is pleasingly tactile and hand-posed, up to Aardman Animations usual high standards. If anything, the expressivity of the human characters impresses more than the animals', a reverse of the usual state of affairs in most animation. The backgrounds are richly detailed, peppered by the company's trademark shop-sign puns, while an impressive cast of extras wanders about in the street scenes. Visually, it all feels very much of a piece with the old-school, old-fashioned worldview that's part of Aardman Animations signature style, and the film is still an absolute delight in terms of set and character design, with sophisticated blink-and-youll-miss-it detailing to counterbalance the franchises cruder visual trademarks. For example, every sheeps mouth still emerges sporadically from the side of its face; no wonder they never speak. Production designer Matt Perry deftly evokes the shifting, half-gentrified streetscape of London without resorting to obvious landmarks. Composer Ilan Eshkeri, taking a breather from scoring the more solemn likes of Still Alice and The Invisible Woman, contributes suitably jangly accompaniment, though assorted pop contributions on the soundtrack don't quite mesh with the wordless story world at hand. But an exception to the rule of course, is the Vic Reeves sung theme tune, here given a rascally makeover by British hip-hop duo, featuring tunes by Eliza Doolittle and Rizzle Kicks.

In a wider sense, as well as the more specific one of Shaun originating as a Wrong Trousers spin-off, this film represents Aardman Animations return to Wallace-and-Gromit of old style favourites, and a consolidation of the seemingly homespun wistfulness that the company clearly does so well. Its just that when we settle down with some Claymation animal human shenanigans, finds ourselves marvelling at some intricately constructed contraption, or is momentarily diverted by a snicker-worthy shop sign; its the cinematic equivalent of the perfect cup of tea. But the amber glow of nostalgia doesnt induce backward-looking sentiment on the part of Aardman Animations vision of contemporary England is generous, because it is inclusive and a very fast-moving film about a smart-alec sheep can allow itself such grandiose ambitions and is genuinely inspiring.

Shaun the Sheep Movie, incidentally, marks the first collaboration between STUDIOCANAL and Aardman Animations, whose past couple of features were financed and distributed by Sony. Although the deal was initially made as a one-off, its not hard to imagine a film franchise emerging from this happy new pairing; the baa, as it were, has been set high.

Blu-ray Video Quality  STUDIOCANAL and Aardman Animations, presents a fantastic theatrically 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a brilliant awesome 1080p sparkling image, but as stated in only available Region B/2 code, especially for people in North America who is keen to purchase this brilliant Blu-ray disc. Shot digitally and in the Claymation stop motion filming, the detail is totally incredible and really reveals how intricate the models and sets are. The characters themselves are extremely well made, the wool of the sheep, the patterns on the clothing and facial expressions, eyes and water for example. The sets are just sublime, from brickwork to foliage, from road paintings to muddy tracks, from caravan interiors to open fields; which makes everything look pin sharp and textured. The colours are just brilliantly good, especially all the primaries colours coming off really well and notably the reds are bold, greens are lush and blues really cool. Digitally there were no compression problems or any edge enhancement, no smearing, or banding and being digital, there are no print issues either, so all in all it has a totally excellent picture image quality. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  You have mainly two excellent audio choices, which consist of 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound mix or the 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio, but of course it is best advice is to stick with surround sound mix. The surround sound mix is totally brilliantly and fantastic, especially with all the action where everything matches what you view of the screen action exactly matches the surround field, so making it totally stunning. Stereo effects comes thick and fast, especially with the sheep moving across the screen to wide open areas of the city scape, buses, cars, motorcycles and crowd chatter providing just some of the effects. There is no dialogue to the film, but the various noises that the characters make are quite natural sounding and are given plenty of directionality when called for. The music score is of the very high standard in the mix and gets some very wide separation, so making full use of the surround speakers, which is in near on constant use for ambient effects. Bass is very well integrated into the mix, and there are a few nice low frequency effects, but it never really goes subterranean, not that it needed to. On the whole this is a totally and very satisfying sound track.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Behind The Scenes [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:14] With this special feature, you will see it is split up into different sections and they are SCRIPT; STORY; MODEL MAKING; SET BUILDING; ANIMATING; VOICE RECORDING; MUSIC and FINAL CUT. At the start of this very nice feature, we first meet Mark Burton [Co-writer/Director] and Richard Starzak [Co-writer/Director] who are trying to put together a script and we just have music in the background to set the scene and we also see them on the Aardman Animations studio. Next up is Peter Lord [Executive Producer] who talks about the loveable character of Shaun the Sheep and why everyone loves this cheeky animal. Next up is Nick Park [Creature Maker of Shaun the Sheep] and talks extensively about what happens on the farm, that no one would normally see what the animals get up to when no humans are about, especially the sheep. As you know that we have loved all the short TV episodes of Shaun the Sheep, well Aardman Animations thought it would be totally brilliant to expand Shaun the Sheep into a big super movie. Next up is Julie Lockhart [Producer] and talks about the idea of having Shaun the Sheep wanting to get away from the farm, but Julie says, Be careful what you wish for. They also say that they feel Shaun the Sheep is like a 12 year old youngster and wanting to push the boundaries, but we also get people talking about the other characters that appear in the film, especially the stray animals and especially the dog catcher, who acts like he is still in the SAS, and Paul Kewley [Producer] goes into more detail about the character of the dog catcher and why his character is like we view. Next up is Nigel Leach [Senior Model Maker] talks in length about the Claymation sheep models and we also get to see some really beautiful colourful sketches of the characters in the film. Next up is Will Becher [Key Character Animator] who talks about how they make the models move and to demonstrate what Will talks about, we get several small clips of the demo animation of Shaun the Sheep all dressed up. Other contributors we get to see talk about Shaun the Sheep Movie and the process that goes into making the film are Lloyd Price [Head of Animation]; Matt Perry [Art Director]; Helen Javes [Senior Set Dresser]; Mathew Healey [Senior Prop Maker]; Justin Fletcher [Voice of Shaun the Sheep] and Ilan Eshkeri. So all in all this is a brilliant special feature and well worth viewing.

Special Feature: Meet The Characters [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:51] With this particular special feature, it is split up into different sections, that are as follows: SHAUN; SLIP; TIMMY and TRUMPER. What is nice about this feature, is that some of the people who worked on the animation film, talk with great affection to all the Claymation characters I have mentioned above and we get lots of extensive clips from Shaun the Sheep Movie, especially the four characters I have already mentions. Again this is quite a nice little feature and a joy to watch.

Special Feature: Join Shaun Behind The Scenes [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:26] Here we meet two of the crew in a look at behind-the-scenes, and they are Andy Symanowski [Animator] and Ellie Watson [Model Maker] who talk extensively about their particular tasks in dealing with the Claymation models. We also get to see some cheeky and very funny animation of Shaun the Sheep in action that is a joy to watch and this is where this nice little special ends and a joy to watch.

Special Feature: Meet The Crew [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:58] With this special feature we get to meet people who was in the previous special feature Behind The Scene, but with some clever extra animation. Once again we meet Julie Lockhart [Producer] who talks about the premise of the story and especially the naughty and cheeky character Shaun the Sheep, but this time you get to see Shaun the Sheep in the background, doing a bit of animation. Next up is Mark Burton [Co-writer/Director] talks about the introduction of new characters, but this time we get to see Slip the dog wandering around behind Mark Burton. Next up is Paul Kewley [Producer] about his contribution of introducing new character to the film, and talks extensively about Trumper, but again in the background we get to see Slip the dog trying to catch a fly. Next up is Richard Starzak [Co-writer/Director] and talks about why the audience will love to watch Shaun the Sheep Movie and again in the background we get to see The Farmer with his headphones on doing a sort of dance, like Dads do at weddings and you know what I mean. Next up is Will Becher [Key Character Animator] talks about why he likes animating Shaun the Sheep, plus of course all the other sheep in the film, because he loves the visuals, but again we get to see in the background Shaun and Bitzer [the famers dog] dancing together, but only a fleeting appearance. So to sum up this particular special feature, what I liked about it, is the addition of the Claymation characters being included, a really nice touch and just shows you why Aardman Animations is so professional in their outlook and well worth a view.

Sneak Peaks: Paddington [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:28]. The House of Magic [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:46]. The Tale of The Princess Kaguya [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:56].

Finally, anyone who has seen the Shaun the Sheep TV animations will have an idea on what to expect from this Claymation film, because the animation is totally top notch, the writing is really above par and as well as being extremely funny, it is also very entertaining. What may surprise is the amount of emotion that these simple stop motion puppets can be produced. The story of Shaun trying to rescue The Farmer who is trapped in the city with no memory becomes a heart-wrenching struggle for the sheep as they are thwarted at nearly every turn by situations of the own making or the machinations of Trumper. The jokes come thick and fast, most of them one-gag in style, some of them slap-stick and others aimed at adults, making this an extremely enjoyable film on many levels. The emotional core of Shauns dependence on The Farmer really pulls on the heartstrings; the climactic scene in the shed when the Farmer's memory is still unclear, cannot fail to bring a lump to your throat. And when Shaun thinks all is lost and those animated eyes well up, youd need a heart of stone not to do the same. With top notch Claymation, it is totally witty and sharp script full to the brim with gags and an emotional core of love and dependence makes this animation film truly a winner. Aardman Animations have proven time and again they are a unique professional powerhouse in both animation and story-telling and Shaun the Sheep Movie is just another in their long line of brilliant successes. As a Blu-ray, the set from STUDIOCANAL and Aardman Animations is pretty decent; the picture is stunning in its representation, especially the bright colours, totally incredible detail and wonderful depth, while the sound is fantastic in its surround environment. On the whole the animation Claymation film will win your heart and emotions so making it a terrific brilliant purchase and so happy to add this to my other Aardman Animations Blu-ray Collections, because Nick Park is a total genius. Very Highly Recommended!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The big screen debut of Aardman Animations beloved TV character is a gloriously crackpot, silent comedy wonder. Everything is sheep shape in this cleverly off-kilter big-screen debut for Aardman Animations lovable farmyard adventurer. Only Aardman Animations, the British creators of Wallace & Gromit, Morph and other lovable Claymation moulded characters, could find an irresistible film in industrial amounts of clay and a story of an amnesiac farmer and his flock at loose in the big city.

Conventional wisdom may have it that sheep are supposedly the dumbest of all livestock, but the woolly ones wits get a collective sharpening in Shaun the Sheep Movie, a sweet-natured but cleverly off-kilter feature-length debut for Aardman Animations plucky farmyard hero. Retaining the gentle, non-verbal comedy and daffy sight gags of the popular stop-motion TV series which itself is a loose spinoff from Aardman Animations cherished Wallace and Gromit franchise. Here we find Shaun and his flock on an urban day out escapade that is more expansive than their usual short-form animation on TV.

Originally introduced 20 years ago in the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit outing in A Close Shave, but here the diminutive sheep Shaun has since headlined more than 100 miniature adventures for the small screen, each one cramming a complex degree of farce into a seven-minute running time, before returning affairs to a rustic status quo. In devising a feature narrative 12 times the length of any single episode, writer-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak have wisely kept a number of the series formal restrictions intact. Most cannily and crucially, the film remains dialogue-free, with the animals communicating solely through expression and gesture, while for example the human characters in something like the Peanuts franchise films and specials, that speak in unintelligible stupid gibberish.

The film opens with a tightly rhythmic montage and shot Super 8-style, illustrating the cheery daily grind at Mossy Bottom Farm, where the flock is tended by a balding, nameless human farmer and his bright, put-upon sheepdog Bitzer. As in every episode, the animals seek an escape from the mundane demands of farm labour, this time ingeniously sending the farmer to sleep via a live chain of fence-jumping. The snowballing sequence of mischief that follows sees him accidentally transported to the big city (London in all but name) and losing his memory.

Naturally, its Shaun and his bleating entourage, ranging from super-sized ewe Shirley to helpless lamb Timmy to the rescue, though its not long before they require rescuing themselves, with their arrival in town triggering unwanted attention from animal containment services. By way of apparent homage, the pic is a happy reminder that the critical rehabilitation of Babe: Pig in the City is complete. Meanwhile, their amnesia-afflicted master The Farmer has stumbled into an unlikely new career as a celebrity barber to moneyed urbanites: The current vogue for severely undercut hairstyles isn't a world away from sheep-shearing, after all. Complete with jabs at social-media marketing, this is one of the films few extended jokes likely to go over the collective heads of very young adults, but its the kind of absurdly exaggerated everyday detail and complete with the repurposing of familiar gadgetry, on which Aardman Animations comic brand is built upon. Other in-built games for adults include spotting various throwaway references to considerably less family-oriented films, like The Night of the Hunter and Scorseses Cape Fear included.

The animation itself is pleasingly tactile and hand-posed, up to Aardman Animations usual high standards. If anything, the expressivity of the human characters impresses more than the animals', a reverse of the usual state of affairs in most animation. The backgrounds are richly detailed, peppered by the company's trademark shop-sign puns, while an impressive cast of extras wanders about in the street scenes. Visually, it all feels very much of a piece with the old-school, old-fashioned worldview that's part of Aardman Animations signature style, and the film is still an absolute delight in terms of set and character design, with sophisticated blink-and-youll-miss-it detailing to counterbalance the franchises cruder visual trademarks. For example, every sheeps mouth still emerges sporadically from the side of its face; no wonder they never speak. Production designer Matt Perry deftly evokes the shifting, half-gentrified streetscape of London without resorting to obvious landmarks. Composer Ilan Eshkeri, taking a breather from scoring the more solemn likes of Still Alice and The Invisible Woman, contributes suitably jangly accompaniment, though assorted pop contributions on the soundtrack don't quite mesh with the wordless story world at hand. But an exception to the rule of course, is the Vic Reeves sung theme tune, here given a rascally makeover by British hip-hop duo, featuring tunes by Eliza Doolittle and Rizzle Kicks.

In a wider sense, as well as the more specific one of Shaun originating as a Wrong Trousers spin-off, this film represents Aardman Animations return to Wallace-and-Gromit of old style favourites, and a consolidation of the seemingly homespun wistfulness that the company clearly does so well. Its just that when we settle down with some Claymation animal human shenanigans, finds ourselves marvelling at some intricately constructed contraption, or is momentarily diverted by a snicker-worthy shop sign; its the cinematic equivalent of the perfect cup of tea. But the amber glow of nostalgia doesnt induce backward-looking sentiment on the part of Aardman Animations vision of contemporary England is generous, because it is inclusive and a very fast-moving film about a smart-alec sheep can allow itself such grandiose ambitions and is genuinely inspiring.

Shaun the Sheep Movie, incidentally, marks the first collaboration between STUDIOCANAL and Aardman Animations, whose past couple of features were financed and distributed by Sony. Although the deal was initially made as a one-off, its not hard to imagine a film franchise emerging from this happy new pairing; the baa, as it were, has been set high.

Blu-ray Video Quality  STUDIOCANAL and Aardman Animations, presents a fantastic theatrically 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a brilliant awesome 1080p sparkling image, but as stated in only available Region B/2 code, especially for people in North America who is keen to purchase this brilliant Blu-ray disc. Shot digitally and in the Claymation stop motion filming, the detail is totally incredible and really reveals how intricate the models and sets are. The characters themselves are extremely well made, the wool of the sheep, the patterns on the clothing and facial expressions, eyes and water for example. The sets are just sublime, from brickwork to foliage, from road paintings to muddy tracks, from caravan interiors to open fields; which makes everything look pin sharp and textured. The colours are just brilliantly good, especially all the primaries colours coming off really well and notably the reds are bold, greens are lush and blues really cool. Digitally there were no compression problems or any edge enhancement, no smearing, or banding and being digital, there are no print issues either, so all in all it has a totally excellent picture image quality.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  You have mainly two excellent audio choices, which consist of 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound mix or the 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio, but of course it is best advice is to stick with surround sound mix. The surround sound mix is totally brilliantly and fantastic, especially with all the action where everything matches what you view of the screen action exactly matches the surround field, so making it totally stunning. Stereo effects comes thick and fast, especially with the sheep moving across the screen to wide open areas of the city scape, buses, cars, motorcycles and crowd chatter providing just some of the effects. There is no dialogue to the film, but the various noises that the characters make are quite natural sounding and are given plenty of directionality when called for. The music score is of the very high standard in the mix and gets some very wide separation, so making full use of the surround speakers, which is in near on constant use for ambient effects. Bass is very well integrated into the mix, and there are a few nice low frequency effects, but it never really goes subterranean, not that it needed to. On the whole this is a totally and very satisfying sound track.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Behind The Scenes [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:14] With this special feature, you will see it is split up into different sections and they are SCRIPT; STORY; MODEL MAKING; SET BUILDING; ANIMATING; VOICE RECORDING; MUSIC and FINAL CUT. At the start of this very nice feature, we first meet Mark Burton [Co-writer/Director] and Richard Starzak [Co-writer/Director] who are trying to put together a script and we just have music in the background to set the scene and we also see them on the Aardman Animations studio. Next up is Peter Lord [Executive Producer] who talks about the loveable character of Shaun the Sheep and why everyone loves this cheeky animal. Next up is Nick Park [Creature Maker of Shaun the Sheep] and talks extensively about what happens on the farm, that no one would normally see what the animals get up to when no humans are about, especially the sheep. As you know that we have loved all the short TV episodes of Shaun the Sheep, well Aardman Animations thought it would be totally brilliant to expand Shaun the Sheep into a big super movie. Next up is Julie Lockhart [Producer] and talks about the idea of having Shaun the Sheep wanting to get away from the farm, but Julie says, Be careful what you wish for. They also say that they feel Shaun the Sheep is like a 12 year old youngster and wanting to push the boundaries, but we also get people talking about the other characters that appear in the film, especially the stray animals and especially the dog catcher, who acts like he is still in the SAS, and Paul Kewley [Producer] goes into more detail about the character of the dog catcher and why his character is like we view. Next up is Nigel Leach [Senior Model Maker] talks in length about the Claymation sheep models and we also get to see some really beautiful colourful sketches of the characters in the film. Next up is Will Becher [Key Character Animator] who talks about how they make the models move and to demonstrate what Will talks about, we get several small clips of the demo animation of Shaun the Sheep all dressed up. Other contributors we get to see talk about Shaun the Sheep Movie and the process that goes into making the film are Lloyd Price [Head of Animation]; Matt Perry [Art Director]; Helen Javes [Senior Set Dresser]; Mathew Healey [Senior Prop Maker]; Justin Fletcher [Voice of Shaun the Sheep] and Ilan Eshkeri. So all in all this is a brilliant special feature and well worth viewing.

Special Feature: Meet The Characters [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:51] With this particular special feature, it is split up into different sections, that are as follows: SHAUN; SLIP; TIMMY and TRUMPER. What is nice about this feature, is that some of the people who worked on the animation film, talk with great affection to all the Claymation characters I have mentioned above and we get lots of extensive clips from Shaun the Sheep Movie, especially the four characters I have already mentions. Again this is quite a nice little feature and a joy to watch.

Special Feature: Join Shaun Behind The Scenes [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:26] Here we meet two of the crew in a look at behind-the-scenes, and they are Andy Symanowski [Animator] and Ellie Watson [Model Maker] who talk extensively about their particular tasks in dealing with the Claymation models. We also get to see some cheeky and very funny animation of Shaun the Sheep in action that is a joy to watch and this is where this nice little special ends and a joy to watch.

Special Feature: Meet The Crew [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:58] With this special feature we get to meet people who was in the previous special feature Behind The Scene, but with some clever extra animation. Once again we meet Julie Lockhart [Producer] who talks about the premise of the story and especially the naughty and cheeky character Shaun the Sheep, but this time you get to see Shaun the Sheep in the background, doing a bit of animation. Next up is Mark Burton [Co-writer/Director] talks about the introduction of new characters, but this time we get to see Slip the dog wandering around behind Mark Burton. Next up is Paul Kewley [Producer] about his contribution of introducing new character to the film, and talks extensively about Trumper, but again in the background we get to see Slip the dog trying to catch a fly. Next up is Richard Starzak [Co-writer/Director] and talks about why the audience will love to watch Shaun the Sheep Movie and again in the background we get to see The Farmer with his headphones on doing a sort of dance, like Dads do at weddings and you know what I mean. Next up is Will Becher [Key Character Animator] talks about why he likes animating Shaun the Sheep, plus of course all the other sheep in the film, because he loves the visuals, but again we get to see in the background Shaun and Bitzer [the famers dog] dancing together, but only a fleeting appearance. So to sum up this particular special feature, what I liked about it, is the addition of the Claymation characters being included, a really nice touch and just shows you why Aardman Animations is so professional in their outlook and well worth a view.

Sneak Peaks: Paddington [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:28]. The House of Magic [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:46]. The Tale of The Princess Kaguya [2013] [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:56].

Finally, anyone who has seen the Shaun the Sheep TV animations will have an idea on what to expect from this Claymation film, because  the animation is totally top notch, the writing is really above par and as well as being extremely funny, it is also very entertaining. What may surprise is the amount of emotion that these simple stop motion puppets can be produced.

6998053,5,B00SYX6J2I,"When I saw the trailer I wasn't sure if the tried-and-true Shaun the Sheep format (short, funny skit-based episodes with no dialog) would translate well to a full-length film.  I should have had more faith in Aardman.  The movie is fun, fast-paced, never drags, and keeps you laughing throughout.

There are some fun new characters.  My kids and I particularly enjoyed the new villain, A. Trumper.  He is an egomaniac animal control warden with a crush on what he believes to be an attractive woman but is actually a sheep in human clothing.  When I asked my kids what there favorite parts of the movie were, all of them revolved around Trumper's ridiculous antics while trying to capture the flock.  There is also a lovable stray dog and a few others but Trumper stands out.

There are plenty of nods to pop culture that put a smile on my face but that my kids completely missed.  Of course there is a Silence of the Lambs reference (in a dialog-free movie about lambs...).  I caught a few others.  The nod to Banksy was probably my favorite.  Pay attention while watching because the level of detail on the sets is incredible.

The themes in the movie are positive and emphasize teamwork and family (albeit an untraditional family comprised of one human, a dog, sheep, pigs, a bull and a rooster).  The ending leaves you feeling satisfied and happy.  I think that I enjoyed the movie at least as much as my kids did.  If you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy this movie.",1439856000,101,1478,4.541666666666667
6998054,4,B00SYX6J2I,"Funny, sad, sometimes a bit crude but always enjoyable children's (or is that adult-children's?) film about everyone's favorite barnyard sheep character, who ends up taking ""a day off"" and running around the big city instead of going through the dreadfully ordinary routine at the family barn. It's all fun and games (and laughs) until Shaun is captured by a maniacal animal catcher who appreciates his job a bit too much--but in the clink, Shaun meets some new friends, and that's where the adventure (along with a few tears, and innumerable sight gags) begins. As usual, chaos ensues...
Sunny and lightweight adventure claymation/CGI venture is executive produced by Nick Park, the creator of the Shaun character--but I suspect that a few of the toilet humor gags were courtesy of directors Richard Starzak and Mark Burton, who lower the material somewhat and remove a layer of innocence from an otherwise enjoyable script (which is why I lowered my rating by a star). Still, seeing Shaun back on the big screen is hugely enjoyable under any circumstance, and as noted above I was moved by many scenes; this is quality filmmaking under any circumstance, but not quite as inventive (or as flamboyant) as the original Nick Park-directed Wallace and Gromit features (I gave the ""Were-rabbit"" film an easy five stars). To me, the Shaun character has been hijacked by the filmmakers and tinkered with to be made a bit more acceptable to present day audiences, who demand a bit more of John Hughes-type ribald humor rather than the innocent G-rated material that made the original Wallace and Gromit pictures so warm and lovable. But without such carping, it's nice to see a mostly family-friendly picture in theaters that actually has some venerability about it, after having suffered through so much hardcore R-rated material and unpleasant action films in recent years it is nice to get back to some more lighthearted fare. Aardman animation has created some wonderful images here, and even if the material is a bit off-base at times here, the images alone are more unique and interesting that what you'll find in any other film this year (even if Nick Park stepped out of the director's chair). Sadly, ""Shaun the Sheep: the Movie"" seems to have missed the mark with Western audiences; in fact, a lot of the people that I watched the original Wallace and Gromit movies with seemed to have not enjoyed them as much as I did. I suppose they are for kids too, but certainly not for kids alone. Forbes has described the picture as faltering with modern audiences, but perhaps that's okay after all--not every picture is for every taste (apparently this picture has not arrested the family audience like it should have, probably because they misunderstood the humor--some of the more outrageous gags seem to me to have been added as an afterthought) and that's as it should be. In an age where the next new thing is hot for about five minutes only, when animation seems to have taken the dual path between video game-inspired trash or extremely jejune hogwash, when maniac killers are invading the usually placid corridors of movie theaters and blasting off their guns in defiance of the modern, when children are no longer allowed to grow up at the necessary pace, and when the almighty dollar seems to be more important than almost ANYTHING else in public life, a picture like ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" can help to realign both your priorities and your confidence in facing the future--especially at the movies. It's not the movie it could have been, but what remains is pretty good, and certainly a lot better than the rest. B+
P.S. One thing that doesn't make as much sense to me is the mumble type of non-language that these characters speak and use to communicate with...maybe this is a comment about a society falling into illiteracy, maybe it's just supposed to be funny, I don't know (but keep in mind that I have also not yet watched any of the farmer-based tales of Shaun on DVD yet, so maybe this language deal--obviously meant to be comical--has been part of the new Shaun stories all along and I'm just ignorant of the fact). In any case, just be aware that these characters do not speak like Wallace and Gromit do. It's a whole other ball game now. But since this is essentially a funny, lightweight movie it probably doesn't matter as much--but I get the sense that the filmmakers want to find out how to communicate to audiences without using language itself. Probably...
P.S. I also love the opening song ""Everyday Feels Like Summer with You"" (I believe that's the correct title)--it sets a sunny tone for the perfect summer escapist movie for kids of all ages. Oddly enough, only one family was in the theater at the time that I saw this, and the kids were acting rather disinterested and the adults seemed a bit annoyed. Well, it's their loss. I'm hoping that Nick Park and the Aardman creative team gives us more harmless and endlessly enjoyable pictures like this one in the near future.",1439251200,28,5001,4.816279069767442
6998055,4,B00SYX6J2I,"Claymation studio Aardman (""Wallace & Gromit"") has created an award-winning PG-rated tale of a busybody sheep who must fix a problem he has created. These characters are based on a long-running TV series in the UK. We are charmed by mornings at the farm: a montage of activities that starts with a rooster crowing and ends with the farmer finally emerging from his house. There are many funny steps in between.

Shaun is inspired by an ad on a bus; he decides to think outside the box and break up the morning routine. As a result he gets The Farmer in big, big trouble. Now he and his stalwart sidekick, the sheepdog Bitzer, have to get their amnesiac shepherd and his flock out of that dangerous city and safely back home. By the way, the entire movie is done with NO dialogue but not one child in the screening audience missed it.

Writer/director Mark Burton (""Madagascar"") and writer/director Richard Starzak have used the voices of:
  * John Sparkes (""Peppa Pig"") The Farmer loves his animals but through some mischief by Shaun, lands in the big city with amnesia. At least he remembers how to use a clippers: he has sheared many a sheep.
  * Jason Fletcher (""Gigglebiz"") When our hero Shaun lands in the big city animal shelter, we watch all the creatures try to appeal to visitors in hopes they will be adopted. This scene contains many adult movie references to jails that made the parents laugh but went over the heads of the little 'uns.
  * John Sparkes (""Calendar Girls"") Bitzer is the epitome of the hard-working sheep dog. I loved his morning routine where he is seen walking out of the yard clutching a roll of toilet paper with a newspaper under his arm. Like Shaun, he is determined to get The Farmer back home where he belongs.
  * Omid Djalili (""Moonfleet"") is Trumper, the Animal Containment Officer who we come to realize will stop at nothing to recapture the fugitive Shaun.

As you can see by the credits, this cast and crew are from children's television in the UK. They even offer an odd musical interlude. My major concern was that too much of the movie was over the heads of the children; in fact about two-thirds of the way through, a little voice piped up, ""Is it going to get better again?"" About then, the final (lengthy) chase scene began and after that, no child had a dull moment. Whew!",1439251200,2,2321,4.5686746987951805
6998056,4,B00SYX6J2I,"Shaun too, but I meant the movie.

It was a long day, I was tired, and not interested in thinking too hard about anything, Shaun was just what the doctor ordered. Beautifully animated, like all the Aardman films, distinctly (and distinctively) goofy, and completely un-threatening. My wife and I laughed like we hadn't in ages. And, since we saw it at night, we had the theater to ourselves, since the target audience mostly has to be in bed by eight.

6998057,5,B00SYX6J2I,"From the Aardman Studios comes yet another classic film, ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"". Based on the small, determined Shaun the sheep introduced in the classic Wallace & Gromit short ""A Close Shave"", Shaun takes us on a new adventure complete with his sheep pals, Bitzer the guard dog and the Farmer who goes missing in the Big City which launches this particular adventure. The story is quite delightful and manages to strike the right balance of appealing to young children while still leaving plenty around for adults to enjoy. There are strong references to classic films such as ""Cape Fear"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and a couple of nods to ""Night of the Hunter"" which I found very enjoyable.

It should be noted that there is no traditional dialogue in this movie, although you will hear patches of words, grunts and other expressions. In essence, ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" is a silent film that relies on a series of visual gags and impeccable timing to make it all work. Another very satisfying element is the depth of the storytelling in terms of its major and minor characters. One particularly hilarious bit involves a rather intense, angry-looking dog who is a prisoner in the Animal Control Shelter. The mere sight of this dog is arguably one of the funniest moments of the film, but the revelation of his true nature is even more hilarious and applause-worthy even though his total screen time is less than 10 seconds.

If you are a big fan of Aardman's works, then you must see ""Shaun the Sheep Movie"" as it is right up there with ""Chicken Run"" and ""Wallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" in terms of its overall quality, humor and story.",1439078400,9,1654,4.680412371134021
6998058,5,B00SYX6J2I,"Everyone's favorite sheep gets a feature film, as Shaun and his mates plot a day off from their Mossy Bottom farm routine, only to incur all kinds of unexpected and hilarious consequences.  Their master goes missing in the Big City, which means a rescue effort led by Shaun and by Bitzer the Dog. Unfortunately, the sheep will run into their own challenges in the form of a relentless enforcer from Animal Containment.  The  animation is priceless, the humor is very British, and the action builds steadily to a dramatic finish. The sight gags should vastly appeal to the adults in the audience while paying homage to a variety of movies, famously including ""Silence of the Lambs.""  Highly recommended as good entertainment, especially for all you ""Wallace and Gromit"" fans out there.",1438992000,,784,4.961832061068702
