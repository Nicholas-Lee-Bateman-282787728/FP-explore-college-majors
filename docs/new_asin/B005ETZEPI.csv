4667464,5,B005ETZEPI,This is an awesome DVD. It doesn't matter what your faith is....if you believe in Jesus and the good word(Holy Bible) then this DVD will work for you. Even if you don't believe...it is a good clean animation that every child would enjoy...(GIGO). If you fill your kids mind with garbage filled video....you will get garbage out. have a great day!,1351555200,3,346,4.688524590163935
4667465,5,B005ETZEPI,"Bought this as a gift for my grandchildren and was very pleased. Since I wanted a DVD that would span different ages, I wanted something that could keep the little ones attention but not bore the older ones. This DVD did the trick! What a good message of faith to pass on to the next generation! I would highly recommend this DVD.",1346544000,3,330,4.338709677419355
4667466,5,B005ETZEPI,My kids love it!!! This is the secon Theo DVD they have and They don't care about watching something else in the car. This company will make more Theo's DVDs they r excellent for children.,1344643200,,188,4.4
4667467,5,B005ETZEPI,We bought this after discovering the iPhone app. It's a great movie and message. Unfortunately our son tried to take the DVD out of the case himself and broke it in half. We haven't bought it again yet.,1336608000,,202,4.342105263157895
4667468,2,B005ETZEPI,"This series is well produced, but it surprised me to hear Theo hum through the line ""that saved a wretch like me"" when he was singing Amazing Grace.  What is wrong with children understanding that we are wretched before God?  It is not right to have the love of God proclaimed without balancing it with the fact that we are sinners who have offended a holy God.  I was saddened by this obvious ""censoring"" of the most famous hymn of all time.",1333843200,12,442,4.365853658536586
4667469,5,B005ETZEPI,"I found this DVD to be quite adorable.  My children, ages 10, 7, & 3 especially loved watching the funny antics of Belfry and Luther - the 2 mice.  It is difficult to find good videos and teaching tools for children that teach about God and the Bible while also entertaining at the same time.  I was pleased to see scriptures quoted throughout the segments, as well as snippets of hymns in the background.  A unique way to acclimate young ones to traditional hymns and sneak in some wonderful scripture while they are entertained by the adorable mice and Bible stories.

The animation is exceptionally well done.  The stories are short and cute.  The kids were entertained, and I was even interested in watching the whole episode with them.

I highly recommend checking out this new DVD series!  Click on some of the links below for more information.  This DVD was released in stores on September 13th, 2011 - make sure to get a copy!!!",1321747200,4,936,4.618181818181818
4667470,5,B005ETZEPI,"I will first say, I was expecting this to be full length like most other kids DVD's, 20-30 minutes at least.  I was a little disappointed when after 5 minutes for one and 9 for the other, they were over.  The content was great, just short.  I will say for my younger kids it is perfect.  They loved them and will watch them over and over.
As mentioned above, there are two episodes, Saving Faith which was about having faith in the right things and Good News which was about salvation.  Theo is a grandfather type guy and he talks straight to the kids in terms my kids can understand.  I love Theo, you might remember him from McGee and Me and Adventures in Odyssey.  There are also two mice who are quite funny, but I would have liked to see them more.  Although, in such short stories I think they added a great touch.
I think overall most parents would be somewhat disappointed at the length if purchasing just for pleasure but if used in homeschool, as a teaching tool, they would be fabulous.  Also, with us being Children's Ministry Consultants, I can see these short Theo episodes being a great ""go to"" tool to reinforce something already being taught.  They do have a Children's Church curriculum available from LifeWay Christian stores and I will be recommending it to our children church contacts for use in their preschool classes.",1315958400,4,1342,4.554166666666666
4667471,5,B005ETZEPI,"A new animated series, Theo, teaches and guide children and adults through Biblical theology. Theo is an elderly gentleman (who my youngest told me reminded her of Belle's father, from Beauty and the Beast), who discusses the doctrines of what sin is, God's character, The Bible, salvation and godly-living with easy-to-understand illustrations that make children want to learn more about the Christian faith.

Theo's messages are well animated and accompanied by two mice, Belfry and Luther, who have a way of keeping it interesting in their quest for cookies that Theo makes. This DVD comes with two animated shorts:
1. Saving Faith

Did you know that the same type of faith that saved Abraham, saves you and me? Kids will be entranced by Theo, a kind English theologian who teaches what it means to have genuine, or saving faith. Theo shares the story of Abraham to illustrate the life of a man who trusted the promises of God and walked by faith. Just as the Lord promised Abraham a son and fulfilled His promise, He promised a Savior to us. And sent Jesus into the world at just the right time.

2. Loving Obedience

Loving God and obeying Him are two peas in the same pod! If we love God, we will obey Him. Luther and Belfry, two field mice that have befriended Theo, lack obedience and get into trouble wherever they go. Children will learn a valuable lesson and be entertained at the same time as Theo uses the story of Jonah to illustrate the consequences of disobedience, and the blessings that come when we love God through doing what He asks of us.

3. Forgiveness

Nothing is more basic to the Gospel than forgiveness. Did you know that forgiveness in the biblical sense means to set something free? However, learning to forgive is not easy for Theo's furry friends Luther and Belfry. In this episode, Theo teaches the important lesson of forgiving others through the parable of the Unforgiving Servant. For if we do not forgive others, we cannot expect God to forgive us!

I received this DVD compliments of Propeller and Whitestone Media for my honest review and wish these were out when my kids were younger. The animation rates right up there with Disney and because the message is short and to the point, kids will love how simple it is to understand the concepts of salvation and faith. My daughter who also viewed this with me, said she will be using them when she has kids of her own. She LOVED them and she's 12!I'd give this DVD a 5 out of 5 stars!

Michael Joens is the producer and director of Theo and has produced dozens of animated commercials for Milton Bradley, Hasbro, Kenner, McDonald's and Playskool. In addition to commercial work, he produced and directed the animation segments of the award-winning series, ""McGee and Me,"" as well as the animated ""Adventures in Odyssey"" for Focus on the Family. He is now using his talents to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Theo into all the world.",1315699200,8,2930,4.686770428015564
4667472,5,B005ETZEPI,"I was asked to review this wonderful DVD. It is of a man named Theo who loves the Lord and wants to teach children about the important things of the Lord. Theo Presents is a most lovable, interesting cartoon. Many cartoons are poorly put together and seem to lack imagination, but not Theo. This is a brilliant cartoon that is full of teachings and love of the Lord.

The one I reviewed is called Saving Faith and it is about 10 minutes long. It tells about the life of Abraham and how he had faith and always believed in God.

The creator has worked on many very famous, award-winning series and commercials, but always wanted to teach the word to children in cartoon form.

I know without a doubt this is going to be a very big, winning series. The cartoon I reviewed was intriguing, but very simple to understand and the characters so very special. Theo an Englishman and two cute mice.

This series is awesome and can't wait to view the other ones when they come out. The titles below are the ones to come next.

Really highly recommend this DVD and besides being very entertaining, these DVDs are full of many lessons. These cartoons are for children of all ages. Don't you love cartoons? You will love these.

4667477,4,B005ETZEPI,"I wish I could give half a star -- 4.5 out of 5. We will recommend this series and will buy other volumes but I do have a few reservations after watching this first volume several times.

PROS:
- content is very solid; biblically sound!
- my toddler loves the stories and requests to watch ""the mice""
- 2 types of animation show a distinction between the story about Theo and Bible stories
- all the DVDs (each volume) include the ""Good News"" episode at the end

CONS:
- the episodes are concise (to the point) and could elaborate better
- the episodes are about 10 minutes each which is an awkward length for use in Sunday School or kids class at church (I wish they were longer)
- this first volume talks several times about behavior that ""pleases God""; I would have liked more clarification that good works do not save as well as a discussion about the security of the believer (God is pleased with us already because of Christ!)",1399420800,11,932,4.412790697674419
4667478,5,B005ETZEPI,"It talks about the salvation plan in a very creative way. My four years old really likes it.
I enjoyed watching as well.",1397001600,,120,4.260869565217392

4667480,3,B005ETZEPI,My daughter watched this once and was not interested in watching again. She said it wasn't as good as the Super Book series which she loves. Maybe it is just her. She is 7.,1375660800,2,172,4.088235294117647

8469050,5,B005ETZEPI,"I honestly cant say enough about this whole series! There are a lot of Christian cartoons for kids these days, but ones that really don't have a lot of depth to them. This series is absolutely gospel saturated, but in a way that young kids can understand! Keeps their attention but also dives deep into the different theological topics.",1515542400,,336,4.711864406779661

8469052,5,B005ETZEPI,"Theo is a wonderful introduction to the basics of the Christian faith for children. Each episode on this volume is 9-10 minutes long and includes a Bible story narrated by Theo to teach a Christian theme such as forgivness, faith, etc. to Theo's mouse friends Luther and Belfry. The home edition also includes a guide book with prayers, activites, and Bible stories for parents to do with children for continued learning. I would also suggest parents watch the episodes with children and then take time to teach your children your denomination's particular understanding of Christianity based in its creeds, confessions, etc. Theo is designed to be pan Christian however, at times there are hints at an Evangelical Christian emphasis as seen in the mini episode Good News where Theo invites children to say a prayer with him to Jesus inviting him into their hearts so they can be saved (this can also be found on Whitestone Media's website if you look hard).",1506124800,,958,4.919753086419753

8469054,5,B005ETZEPI,"My kids of various ages (4-9) love this video.  Too often Christian kids entertainment runs shallow, flippant or boring.  Theo strikes the perfect balance.  This video teaches the theology of faith, obedience, and forgiveness in short videos that are entertaining, beautifully produced and engaging for young children.  Several times I have heard one of my children articulate a concept they learned watching this video.  We watch it again and again, and everyone who we gifted it to has also loved it.  Excellent production!",1483142400,2,525,5.265060240963855

The content, story and songs were wonderful.  It was honestly a breath of fresh air and there's something very peaceful about listening to ""Theo"" tell the stories.",1414108800,,337,4.301587301587301
