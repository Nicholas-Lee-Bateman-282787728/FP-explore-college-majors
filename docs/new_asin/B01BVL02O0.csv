7669721,5,B01BVL02O0,"Tremendous performances by Toni and Marc Lawrence, great fun to watch!  No wonder this film has a popular cult following, it's perhaps the origin, or at least one of the earliest horror films employing pigs for body dumps!  Extra fun knowing that Marc and Toni are father and daughter in real life and decided to take this scary journey together!  So intense you can't stop stuffing the popcorn in your face just like a pig!!",1458604800,7,425,4.64
7669722,5,B01BVL02O0,"Horror movies can be a lot of fun and this one does not disappoint.  The secret ingredient, however, is the performance by Toni Lawrence.  She brings honesty, pathos and sensitivity to her role.  From the start, we wonder what's behind the Mona Lisa expression.  You know what they say: still waters run deep.  In this case that means they run deep in rich, red blood. If you're a fan of the genre, treat yourself! And if you like to watch gifted actors at work, you'll be especially pleased.",1458259200,5,492,4.545454545454546
7669723,5,B01BVL02O0,"This is easily the best cut of this movie to date. Those of you who are fans know that there have been several versions of this film made already, with added footage and varying degrees in quality of production and editing ranging from ""okay"" to ""miserable."" Somehow, it hasn't diminished the appeal of the movie to its' enthusiasts. This version is the original, as Marc Lawrence intended, and the film has been wonderfully cleaned up. This film is a real treat if seen on the big screen, as I had the good fortune to do at the recent premiere screening in Los Angeles, which also featured Toni Lawrence talking about the film, answering questions from the audience, and signing autographs. I would think that such screenings would be available in the future should the demand exist. For fans of the horror genre this remake, lovingly and respectfully done, will demonstrate why this film was such an influence on other film makers of the era, notably Tobe Hooper, who has stated that ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" would not have existed without his first seeing ""Pigs."" So....get the new DVD, enjoy, and then make some noise about bringing this movie to your town. It can happen.",1458000000,6,1181,4.794117647058823

Restored ,but keep it mind with the way it was shot was intended to look gritty.  But otherwise very cool print thanks.",1517356800,,293,4.3090909090909095
8751639,5,B01BVL02O0,"Around the early '90s or thereabouts, I found a used VHS tape of this movie in a second-hand store (though I had no sense of perspective, perception or definition of the phenomena, this was at a time in my life when I began to realize that almost any independent-looking vintage exploitation film with garish advertising was worth taking a chance on).

I was aware that what was ""promised"" on the cover was not necessarily going to be delivered in the actual viewing (many times a relief), so I plunked down my nickels and let the happy fool be immediately soon parted with his money. In this case that parting was expedited by the fact that I recognized the most-welcome presence of character actor Marc Lawrence on the cover, whose role as ""Cobby"" in Asphalt Jungle was forever burned into my synapses.

For the next few years afterward, that VHS tape was enjoyed and revisited often. Lawrence directed and stars in it, along with his (real-life) daughter Toni, and though micro-budgeted, it's an experience like no other. The magnetic cinematography, haunting music, uncomforting locations, quirky pacing, ALL add up to an ""I've got to see this again"" experience.

Years went on, and by, and so-forth, and for the life of me I don't recall what happened to that VHS. I rented the Troma-released DVD one day, but the disc was pretty roached (due to some previous fiend who had rented it and looked as if they had taken a hot curling iron to the playing surface) and stuttered through the last ten minutes; not a total loss, but unsatisfying nonetheless.

Then one day I saw the announcement on Amazon that Vinegar Syndrome were preparing a remaster/re-release of the film so I kept it on my radar. They had a great track record of doing things right, and the extras also looked mighty interesting, so when time/budget permitted, those good old nickels were gladly plunked down once again, and I'm happy to say that it's doubtful anyone else will ever top this edition.

The movie is finally presented in what turns out to be Marc Lawrence's original vision (the film was bought out and chopped/reconfigured into various other editions along it's storied history, all chronicled within the special features here). In true Vinegar Syndrome style, they've managed to add in (among the many other extras) a current-day interview with the ever-charming and downright fascinating Toni Lawrence herself, who fills in many grey areas and provides lots of background on her and her late Father's life.

Just wonderful stuff, and uniquely fulfilling after loving this strange film for all these years.",1516233600,,2593,4.908675799086758

8751641,3,B01BVL02O0,"If you appreciate old exploitation movies from the 70's then this one may be worth a look. Bizarre and, honestly, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it was compelling enough to maintain my interest thru to the end. Will I ever watch it again? Probably, as I'm still trying to make some sense of its bizarre ending .Toni Lawrence is attractive & gives a pretty decent performance. Most of the onscreen violence is implied so don't go in expecting a ""chunk blower"". What gore is shown is rather simple and crude and looks along the lines of what you'd see in a HG Lewis film.
So, if you can get past the rather nonsensical ending this is fairly entertaining for its grindhouse atmosphere, look and mood. Just don't expect much in the way of a story.",1494460800,,754,4.431654676258993

8751643,2,B01BVL02O0,"This review is for the Blu Ray combo release.

After hearing about this flick for a while, I bought the combo pack. The movie isn't horrible, but it's nothing great either. A lone drifter stumbles into town and applies for a job at a cafe. It comes with room and board. The drifter (real life daughter of the star and director) is on the run and may or may not be crazy. There's a little blood, minimal intrigue...oh yeah, the star digs up corpses and may be killing people for pig feed. And somehow the victims end up as pigs. Maybe good for a single viewing but I can't see it being viewed in your collection often.

The film looks great on this set. Kind of weird that they used the old, Troma title card for this ""definitive"" edition. Some of the extras make it seem like they were going in a different direction for this (could have been far more interesting from what you see in the deleted scenes) and a couple cool features include interviews with those associated with the movie including one of the leads, Toni Lawrence (one of Billy Bob Thornton's ex-wives!) that was recently shot.

Could have been a lot better.",1480291200,,1124,4.446601941747573

8751645,1,B01BVL02O0,If you don't know what this movie is about well that makes 2 of us. come on 4.5 stars. The whole premise is stupid and the sound is horrible screeching but as far a blood and gore it's there but you never see it. The ending is ridiculous I could barley watch this and when I finished it went and visited the happy trash. If you liked hanger your going to hate this. By the way it's a 70s movie so look for no anything is this movie,1465171200,,431,3.909090909090909
8751646,3,B01BVL02O0,"Crazy meets crazier when a seriously unbalanced young woman on the run from a mental asylum goes from the frying pan into the fire and ""escapes"" to Zambrini's Cafe, a filthy little eatery in the middle of nowhere.  This nasty dive has about two regular hayseed customers, a clueless & friendly sheriff who stops by from time to time, and a troubled history of missing waitresses.  It's no big stretch of the imagination to guess (from the title alone) where the remains of unlucky redneck neighbors & customers are ending up in actor/filmmaker Marc Lawrence's PIGS.

Maybe you've seen this movie under one of its many, many other titles such as BLOOD PEN or DADDY'S GIRL or DADDY'S DEADLY DARLING  or THE 13TH PIG or... umm, LOVE EXORCISM??
That last one makes a lot more sense when viewed in context of one of the truly zany alternate openings included on this blu-ray.  Seriously, you GOTTA check that one out.

This is probably a release strictly tailored for veteran fans of the sleazy exploitation genre.  It's micro-budgeted and dated-looking even for its time, and it isn't particularly thrilling.  The sound design is eerie at times, with shrieking, almost-human sounding pig squeals... but that can also be obnoxious and grating, depending on your sensibilities.  All the walls are filthy.  The ""plot"" is choppy and uneven and clearly the product of Marc Lawrence's indecision as to what kind of movie he was really trying to make... slasher film? love story? demonic possession??  It has an atrocious and repetitive hippie rock song played over the film credits.  The acting performances range from ""meh"" to ""just OK"" to downright WEIRD, which isn't the worst thing you could for a production of this low caliber, I suppose.  The one standout is Marc Lawrence himself, who appeared in approximately 175 films throughout his career, ranging from the James Bond pic DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER to Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez's FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. If you're a fan of fairly obscure horror cinema, Lawrence's fidgety, loony old man character might be a treat for you.  It's certainly MY favorite part of this production, and the best reason to seek this film out in the first place. He really was a very talented performer who infused a lot of nuance into his depiction of Zambrini (as much nuance as such an underdeveloped story would allow, at least).

This blu ray release by ""prestige"" horror clearinghouse Vinegar Syndrome is undoubtedly the very best treatment this film is ever going to get.  To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised it got the attention it did for this release, since PIGS is not exactly the sort of show that screams ""high def"" or ""hours of bonus features"".  Picture quality shows its age (appropriately), but looks pretty good from the remaster and assorted footage sources, especially considering there was probably never anything resembling a pristine print to begin with.  In one of the interviews on the disc, composer Charles Bernstein mentions that the film really never even had any official final cut, a notion to which it owes all of its alternate titles and alternate ending & opening sequences.  It was previously only available on DVD from Troma, Inc. and they must still have some sort of stake in it because the infamous Troma title card still appears before the credits on this, which I assume will be considered the ""definitive"" edition.

Additional data - the blu ray also includes various trailers, a reversible alternate cover insert, an interview with the director's daughter and co-star Toni Lawrence, and a nearly feature-length audio interview with the director of photography (Glenn Roland) which sort of doubles as a type of commentary track that they play over the feature.  This interview is by far the most in-depth and detailed background of anything related to this little-seen movie, and it meanders often into technical discussions and other film-making anecdotes which oughtta be a fun listen for people who are interested in the background of independent cinema,  particularly THIS drive-in oddity OR beyond into the DP's other projects like ILSA: SHE-WOLF OF THE S.S. (!!!)

It's a tough movie to recommend to casual fans or anyone who isn't already familiar with this sort if thing.  But if you are reading this review at all chances are you very well MIGHT BE into ""this sort of thing"",  in which case I endorse it, especially if you can get it at the right price...I've noticed that the price fluctuates wildly from week-to-week here on Amazon, sometimes reaching up as high as almost $30 and sometimes down to @ $16.  Time your purchase wisely.",1460246400,12,4619,4.943078913324709
