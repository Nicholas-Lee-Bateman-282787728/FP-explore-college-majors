4485627,5,B004W75BRO,"Soul Eater has got to be the best series that's well drawn, well thought out, and also completely bad-ass!!! In episodes 27-51 Maka, Black Star, and Death the Kid have matured a little in their character development as the plot thickens with the revival of the spider witch Arachne and Kishin Asura. But despite the seriousness there is also the comedy that help keep the series in balance between serious and funny, Excalibur for example! The best part about this DVD is that includes all the elements that every anime should have: laughs, friendship, amazing battle sequences, and most of all a giant robot fight!!!!!!!! I mean what anime wouldn't be complete without at least one giant robot fight thrown into the mix~!
For those who are thinking of buying this DVD you totally should! You won't regret it~!",1322265600,9,810,4.83453237410072
4485628,5,B004W75BRO,"My Soul Eater blu-rays arrived in great time, excellent condition, and I loved the series. I had been recommended it by a friend, and I jumped at the chance to get hold of it. Totally worth the purchase.",1319846400,2,203,4.368421052631579
4485629,5,B004W75BRO,"Great set that ties up the series. The manga keeps going, but the anime appears to end here.

Buy it online. You'll save at least $20.

**SPOILER ALERT**
Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, they showed the only thing missing: Giant Robots.",1315872000,3,251,4.555555555555555
4485630,5,B004W75BRO,"I watched Soul Eater originally out of boredom one night. Unlike many anime that take 4-5 episodes to get going, Soul hits the ground running and is a great combination of drama, action, violence, love and comedy. The characters are very endearing. The animation is top notch. You should have this in your collection.

Oh, and yes, it is Pum Pum Pumpkin yummy!",1314489600,6,360,4.714285714285714
4485631,4,B004W75BRO,"First we got Medusa, then Asura the kishin. And in ""Soul Eater: The Weapon Collection,"" we add a new magical supervillain to the Evil gang-- along with a slew of elaborate battle, magical items, insanity, and some disturbing revelations. The ending of the series doesn't match the manga (which hasn't ended yet) but it's a solid wrap-up for the series.

The long-lost witch Arachne (sister of Medusa) rises from the golem and reactivates her old organization, Arachnophobia. And she wastes no time in reactivating her old organization, Arachnophobia, and gathering magic tools that are vital to her plans of spreading insanity. Even worse, Medusa has somehow survived, possessed the body of a child, and is now forcing Crona to do her bidding.

It doesn't take long for war to break out between Arachnophobia and the DMWA -- first a battle over the Brew, a powerful magical tool that's locked in a strange magical field, and then a full-out military clash between armies. Death the Kid discovers that Death may have a connection to a mysterious figure named Eibon, and Stein is slowly going insane from the madness resonance.

So obviously, things are bleak. With two evil witches attacking and the insane Asura still threatening the whole world, what can Soul, Maka and their friends hope to do to defeat them?

The manga is still going strong, but this is definitely the end of the ""Soul Eater"" anime series. All the major plot threads are woven together in a dense, strong rope without too much filler, important questions are answered (who is Eibon? What does the Brew do?), and there's one brilliant magical fight after another. The only major problem is that it's the end.

Well, okay, the filler episodes can be a little nerve-grating (EXCAAAAALIBURRRR!). But the rest of it is simply brilliant -- the tone grows progressively darker as the writers build up to full-out war, climaxing in a pair of bloody battles. There's also some wonderfully horrifying moments when we see how outright crazy Stein is getting, seeing creepy children and bloody moons. But don't worry, the story is occasionally peppered with zany humor (""Mandolin?"" ""MANDEHLING!"").

And the characters are even more brilliant under pressure. Death the Kid's OCD takes a backseat as he starts an investigation into Eibon, and both he and Maka begin to doubt his father; Soul must grapple with his inner imp once and for all, and Black Star begins to suffer from crippling self-doubt. Arachne makes a nice short-term villain -- cool, calm and amoral -- but the evil is really felt when Medusa slithers back onscreen.

The one downside is Maka's clash with Asura. Well, SOMETHING had to be done, but the way it's handled is just really... cheezy.

""Soul Eater: The Weapon Collection"" collects the second half of this excellent anime series, and sees it turn from a quirky Halloweenish action-comedy to an epic clash. Definitely a must-see.",1307318400,11,2911,4.963039014373717
4485632,5,B004W75BRO,"Meisters and Weapons fight to keep the world in balance from witches, Kishins, and other dark forces that want to send the world into an apocalytic chaos.

4485633,5,B004W75BRO,I already owned the Meister Collection and bought this to see the rest of the series. It is a great series with great quality. No problems at all seeing it. The only issue I have is how it ended so abruptly. I wish the series was longer and not so rushed in the Weapon Collection. It's still an interesting series and I'm sure people will get a kick out of Excalibur's segments.,1355529600,4,378,4.263888888888889
4485634,4,B004W75BRO,"An enjoyable series overall.  My only real complaint is that the ending felt rushed, and it greatly diverged from the Manga.  I would have preferred seeing the Arachnophobia Arc as it appeared in the Manga, even if that meant having a cliffhanging ending instead of the resolution that was chosen.  That way, maybe additional seasons of the anime could have been produced.  Fans of the series should continue reading the Manga, which is still ongoing.  The spinoff Manga ""Soul Eater Not"" is also enjoyable, and features characters which are now starting to appear in the Soul Eater manga.",1346976000,2,588,4.959183673469388
4485635,5,B004W75BRO,I love the series and owning it just makes me feel a little more whole. I highly recommend it if you're thinking about buying.,1346889600,,126,4.291666666666667
4485636,5,B004W75BRO,"I am kind of an anime fiend.  As such, I have some some that were really good, and some that were really bad.  I will say up front that although this has a couple of battles that last through more than one episode it is not the norm.  The series is fun, quick paced, funny in some places, and made me want to cry a little in others (of course that could be my damned girly hormones at work, I never know).  The characters are awesome, my favorite is probably Death the Kid, though I do not share his obessions, I certainly have enough of my own that I can relate.

If you don't want to buy it outright, I think you can watch the first 4 episodes free online at funimation and that got me hooked.  I would say this is at least worth a look.  And the fact that the whole series is wrapped up after 51 episodes is a bonus, I really enjoy Bleach, but buying all the DVD sets sucks.",1344384000,,877,4.005747126436781
4485637,5,B004W75BRO,"This was, In essence, A whole new experience in the soul eater world. The inclusion of the bonus material that wasn't in the original 4 set, the crisper, cleaner animation through the wonder of Up scaling for 1080p. the show is about a young weapons meister named Makka, and her partner, a rowdy weapon named Soul, and their quest in making Soul the new Deathscythe. again, this box set, it, and the accompanied meister box set is amazing. the two together where fairly cheap in comparison to the 4 set of boxes that originally released.",1340841600,,537,4.663157894736842
4485638,5,B004W75BRO,"Don't mind the ""Fool"" in the title...  once you watch the series you will understand...

Pros:

*Artistic design.  Love the quirkiness of the art work and style of presentation.  It never strays away from what the series is all about.

*Great character development. It will pull you into appreciating who the character is, what their personal struggles are and how they mature into their roles.  I like the way they invest 2 to 3 episodes into each character's back-story, but never to give too much or too little.

*Typical Japanese Anime humor... exaggerated expressions...  ""Nose-Bleeds""... snappy one-liners...  If you love Japanese Anime, you will definitely like this series.

*Plot development...  The first 2 seasons were mostly predictable.  You really can't put too many twists in a Harry-Potter like setting...  Students in school, practicing their craft to rid the world of evil...  enduring relationship struggles with their friends... Also I love the way they show the characters's emotion so well...  Sometime how they draw the smiles gives you a glimpse on what the characters are really feeling.... What I like the most is that they give you small clues in what is the ""Ultimate Weapon"" without really telling you.  I guessed wrong in the end but was very close...

*Music.  Typical anime tend to change their ""theme song"" every season... Soul Eaters changed it to fit the development of the story... After the last episode I actually listened and read the translation of the closing song I Wanna Be...  Meshed in very well.  Besides I love the Japanese Punk Rock style...

Cons:
*4 seasons 51 episodes.  I would have like to have 1 more season to expand the story of Lady Medusa and Corona...  Overall a bit on the Short Side.

Conclusion...
*The ending was a perfect fit to who these students were.  I highly recommend this series to anyone.  Enjoy!",1337040000,2,1868,4.941935483870968
4485639,5,B004W75BRO,"this is a very awesome anime its episodes 27-51. the Last collection ended with the kishin reviving now its the team ,Maka and Soul, Black star and tsubaki, Death the kid and Liz/patty, trying to stop the madness that the kishin has brought but an old enemy returns and now they have to deal with that aswell. Its sad that the anime is only 51 episodes but its anime thats memorable and i wish it had more episodes.",1335052800,,415,4.333333333333333
4485640,5,B004W75BRO,"Soul Eater is my third anime. I have long preferred manga, which is usually better thought out, but my friends only agreed to watch Black Butler if I watched this first, so I agreed. And I must say that I was not disappointed.

First of all, this series is Shonen with a female protagonist, which is rare, and is able to keep Maka acting like an almost real girl- something rare in Shojo or its male counterpart. She spent absolutely no time squealing with delight, falling for boys(okay, that one's questionable. She and Soul are pretty darn close), or obsessing over clothing that isn't her signature Underworld-esque cloak. Three days after seeing the first episode, my mom offered to let me go to my first anime convention for my birthday, and I immediately decided I would be cosplay none other than One-Star Scythemeister Maka Albarn.

I don't think there were any boring points in this series. I don't remember a single episode without at least one fight scene-all of which were beautifully done. The fact that more than half of the characters turn into deadly weapons at will guarantees that the action never stops-- ever.

This show is hilarious. I have literally skipped home from my local high school singing the Excalibur song. I started singing it in the shower once and almost choked to death on the soapy water I inhaled from laughing. I love this story, and everything about it. It brings happiness to... well... the soul.

Shoutout to Crona's voice actor(Also known for Alphonse Elric from the recent remake of Fullmetal Alchemist). AMAZING job-- especially in the desert of his soul scene. Which brings me to the fact that I liked all of these actors. Everyone's voice fit their character.

All in all, I give this five stars, and a proclamation that this is my new favorite series. Now, I'm off to read its manga.",1331683200,2,1832,4.748427672955975
4485641,5,B004W75BRO,"The 2nd Half and Finale Of the Epic Soul Eater Anime. Now I'll go On record To Say That Unlike the 1st Half of this Series This 2nd Half does NOT follow the Origional Soul Eater Manga (Japanese comic) Due to the fact That During the shows making the Manga did not get to the plot point where the Anime was up to. Therefore the studio BONES (The Animators of Soul Eater) Decided To Break Away from the story and Create there own Plot.

IMHO I Enjoyed The Plot that was Created By studio Bones In the short Time span They had To end this SOul Eater Anime Story with. But Manga Purists and ""haters"" will say It sucks. Do Not Listen the them. Please Watch and Judge For yourself If you Like the Studio Bones Developed Plot or not. And If your 1 of Many that has Viewed or own the 1st Part Of the Soul Eater Anime then you MUST Pick this Set up to Complete this WOnderful Saga :)

Also It has Been confirmed that Studio BONES CEO has Been talking to the Soul Eater Series Creator Atsushi kubo, Of Making A Remake Of the SOul Eater Anime, Which will Follow the Manga From Start To finish. (Very Similar to how full metal Alchemist was Remade due to the same reasons, also Animated By Studio BONES) So If You don't Like This This 2nd Half For Soul EAter Anime, Keep Your Hopes Up and Wait for The remake.",1331424000,2,1297,4.163346613545817

8444616,3,B004W75BRO,"As the second half of this anime where it deviates from the manga quality dips storywise. The plot just kind of does whatever it wants for a bunch of episodes and then ends with a very copy&paste ""hope and courage defeats evil"" type of set up. It's too bad because this was the part of the comic where things got serious and really interesting. Animation and voice acting are fine for both English and Japanese. I'm not a huge ""read the manga"" guy most of the time but in this case you really should or not watch at all...

Personally I'd love to see this entire portion of the show retconned so they can rewind and do it the right way.",1442534400,,636,4.256198347107438
