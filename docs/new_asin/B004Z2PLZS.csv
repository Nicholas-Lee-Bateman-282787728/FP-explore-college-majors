Although, It Doesn't Come across as a B Movie, it is still a really good movie. All the Actor's were really good, Except one. The Young Guy. I Reccomend That you check this movie out.",1314748800,2,331,4.442622950819672
4505586,3,B004Z2PLZS,"The opening scene has a group of ""knights"" chasing a woman on horseback, 1188 AD. She is dressed in white with a long flowing red cape. The color contrast is excellent. They managed to skewer the woman, who falls off her horse. The men move closer, and to my surprise she arises and they begin combat. One of the knights uses a special box to entrap the banshee, one with special markings, like a large ""Hellraiser"" puzzle box. At this point I am hooked as the movie shifts to modern times.

A college professor (Lauren Holly) and her students are at work cataloging items when they come across the box and try to decipher the markings. At this point the plot isn't tough to figure out. They open the box, the banshee screams, all who hear it must die, starting with the black guy. yadda yadda yadda. Eventually someone figures out how to get the genii back in the bottle and it is just a matter of who lives, who dies, the peripheral subplots, and special effects that either make or break the movie.

The attacks are a combination of real and psychological, so you never know what is happening. The professor gets stabbed by the banshee, but doesn't die as it wasn't ""real"" but has marks from the attack, which BTW are not in the same alignment (the blades marks are perpendicular) as the weapon that caused them.

The acting was so-so. Marcelle Baer, who played Lauren Holly's daughter was Kristen Stewart bad and perhaps the worst in the lot. There is a rift between her and her mom which was never fully developed, as none of the characters were developed. The plot holes along with a weak and predictable plot are the downfall of this film...That and the ending they stole from Indiana Jones.

No f-bombs, no nudity, one love scene.",1314403200,,1738,4.543130990415335
4505587,3,B004Z2PLZS,"My excuse for buying this DVD, I never got to see the ending when it played on the SyFy Channel.
It's a curious horror flick because on one hand it is every bit as bad as everyone says, on the other hand, I liked the stupid thing.  Go figure.
The story is simplicity itself, after a brief history lesson on the original containment of the Banshee, we are unceremoniously dumped in the present to spend time with an archeology professor (Lauren Holly) and two of her students.  A little banter, a gauntlet from an unknown admirer, a daughter with a penchant for knocking down weeping walls, and we are led to box number two: a box within a box.  It's a fancy box but not a hat box, it's a head box.  Heads being what they are, it screams and explodes.  Something nasty happens in a restroom.  Nightmares all around (LSD is suggested as a possible reason), and they are led on a merry chase to find Broderick Duncan (Lance Henriksen, in one of his more incomprehensible roles; I blame it on the writer).  Why he needed to be involved is anyone's guess as they already possessed everything required to take a Banshee down.
The movie is adequate in what it set out to do.  The body count is quite low, a minor disappointment, I blame the Banshee who was definitely shirking her duties.  (I have high expectations when it comes to Banshees.)  The acting was professional (which doesn't automatically equate with good).  I didn't mind the creature design, I've seen worse.

Can't really explain why I'm keeping it but I am.  I actually want to see it again sometime.  Go figure.",1313193600,,1572,4.528368794326241
4505588,2,B004Z2PLZS,"Lance Henriksen and Lauren Holly are mostly wasted in this thin story of a banshee whose head is brought into the 21st century by some unwitting researchers. The other actors are just okay, and it is hard to care much about anyone or anything in this film.  The creature effects are also rather cheesy.",1311897600,,302,4.592592592592593
4505589,1,B004Z2PLZS,"Originally premiering on the SyFy Channel, Scream of the Banshee is another After Dark Original, and another flick from this year's After Dark lineup that is just beyond bad.  Featuring a non-sensical plot involving a group of students and a recently dug-up evil banshee that is all the more hard to make sense of thanks to the fact that there appears to be problems with the boom-mic picking up the dialogue (either that or the actors talk so soft that you will be reaching for your remote A LOT), to the fact that said actors involved (most notably Lauren Holly) seem so disinterested in the proceedings that they're practically asleep in front of the camera.  Genre stalwart Lance Henriksen appears briefly as a bat-crazy one time scholar, and is the only thing in Scream of the Banshee that does anything worthwhile.  Poor effects (makeup and gore-wise) and an ending that is ripped straight from the ending to Raiders of the Lost Ark (?!) don't help matters much either.  All in all, avoid Scream of the Banshee like the plague, you'll be glad you did.",1311811200,,1057,4.728260869565218
4505590,2,B004Z2PLZS,"I really enjoyed the previous entries in the AFTER DARK ORIGINALS so I'm a little disappointed in SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE.  Production values are more direct-to-DVD level and the performances far below expectations.  Maybe the SyFy channel is focusing more on quantity rather than quality.
The premise of the Irish banshee folklore has possibilities but a poorly written script and weak performances result in a sloppy execution.  Lauren Holly seems totally disinterested in her role as does the venerable Lance Henriksen who seems to do anything for a paycheck.  The lesser known actors are just awful.  There are a couple of jolts in the movie but nothing truly terrifying.  Also the sound mixing is terrible.  The sound effects blare out even making the banshee's scream more annoying than frightening and the dialogue obnoxiously soft.  Keep your remote handy.
Hopefully After Dark originals coming up (AREA 51 and THE TASK) are better than this misfire.",1311724800,,956,5.162337662337662

For a movie that aired on the Syfy channel, I say it's well worth that 15.99 purchase. This movie isn't filled with those cheesy actors you're used to like a lot of horror movies I've seen. These individuals are experienced, and can seriously act. The characters are believable, you feel their pain when their ears bleed, feel their emotions when their loved one dies, and spit soda out of your mouth when humor starts to roll in and you're not even drinking soda! I gave this movie 5 stars because I honestly believe this is guaranteed to send chills down your spine and will change your life forever, fearing the banshee's out to get ya.",1308441600,6,738,4.556390977443609

4505594,5,B004Z2PLZS,"This was a great movie in my opinion. The special effect weren't bad it was just right in my opinion, it left me having dreams about the movie rather than nightmares, and it was able to scary me without totally freaking me out. The actors were cool I was more in favor of Todd Haberkorn, and the story wasn't bad either. And I will not spoil anything but don't be close to the screen or you just might knock the computer off the desk, lol.

4505595,4,B004Z2PLZS,This is another one of those movies that I think was made originally for the Sci Fi channel a while ago. Having said that it is one of their better efforts with a good story and good cast. There are a couple of well known names in it but other than that it's mostly little known actors who still do a good job with their characters. From the title it's easy to deduce that the movie is about a banshee and so tends to get a little messy with gore. Not a kids movie for sure but if you are a horror movie fan it's worth a look so check it out.,1372982400,4,542,3.8482142857142856
4505596,1,B004Z2PLZS,"This was an embarrassment to the horror film industry.  I completely understand that ""After Dark Originals"" are ""a new brand of fear"", but this one is an old brand of junk.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes open, but when I realized I should give it a chance, I found myself laughing at some of the so-called gore scenes.  The cranberry juice they must have used as blood, looked more like an aged Cabernet or Merlot.  The banshee makeup looked like it was make of Play Dough.  This is really bad.  I couldn't find an actor/actress in the flick.  Don't waste your time or money.  Let the banshee scream.  Save yourself the screams of disappointment.",1354838400,,650,4.487179487179487

4505598,1,B004Z2PLZS,"Many have talked about the fact that the Sy Fy channel makes terrible movies to run on their station. Usually it's some form of giant predatory snake, lizard, crocodile/alligator or dragon gone wild or pumped full of experimental drugs. With a touch of incredibly poor CGI effects, these movies are pumped out faster than the old AIP horror films.

On rare occasions Sy Fy delves into movies of another kind as well. Their takes on horror have created a new low in that genre, the results of which offer movies whose special effects budgets (incredibly low at best) are better than what they spent on the script. Pick up a few genre actors looking for a quick check or an actor down on their luck when it comes to hot prospects and BAM, you have a Sy Fy original.

SCREAM OF THE BANSHEE is one such flick. A part of the After Dark series (which while many bad mouth I've found to offer good and bad movies), the film concerns archeology professor Isla Whelan (Lauren Holly) and two of her students are in the midst of organized and recording a ton of artifacts located in the bowels of the university they're in. One recent acquisition delivered to Isla is an ancient metal glove that we saw a knight wearing at the start of the film when he and several other nights took on some creature in a flowing red gown.

As they look over the item they're led to a secret room which holds a box hidden away some time previously. Being the smart college group that they are, they realize the glove is a key of sorts that opens the box. Hoping to find some serious treasure, they are rewarded only with a rotting head instead. After Isla leaves the 2 students behind for a bit, the head's mouth opens and releases a terrible scream that causes their ears to bleed as well as Isla's and the guard in the building. What they have done is unleash the banshee, trapped within the box for centuries and now free to do harm.

Follow ups with several other clues lead the group to discover that there was a professor prior to them that had found the box and was searching for the glove. This professor (played by Frank Henriksen for perhaps a total of 9 minutes on screen) had the box taken from him by a student assistant, the one responsible for placing it in the wall. Henriksen's search for these items eventually drove him mad. Now it seems that the banshee wants to wreak havoc once again on an unsuspecting world and all that stands in the way are a professor and 2 students.

A few other subplots are tossed in that no one cares about. Isla's daughter going through the usual teen difficulty of a mother that doesn't understand her and that she can't relate to. The assistants are fond of one another yet for some reason don't let on through most of the film. It's extras like these that round out the script or as I tend to consider it, pad out the script so a 30 minute movie lasts a near unbearable 90 minutes.

What is most upsetting is seeing recognizable actors doing films like this. With Henriksen I can understand as he's done it more than once and most likely to make a quick paycheck. At 71 years old he's at the end of his career and probably wanting to leave something behind for his family. But Lauren Holly? This incredibly attractive actress has resorted to roles that were meant for women far younger. And if not, then the characters should be more concerned for their positions and such rather than how attractive they are. Holly looks good, but come on, how many professors make an attempt to dress with shirts unbuttoned enough to allow their students a life lesson they should have learned in the back seat of a Chevy while in high school. I for one would much rather see Holly playing characters her age and looking her age. To do otherwise is to assume that women over 40 can't be attractive on their own without the help of modern medicine or without doffing their clothes when the chance presents itself.

On the whole this film leaves little to make it worthwhile. There are no scares with the exceptions of the expected jump scenes, those scenes where things are quiet and suddenly something jumps up accompanied by a loud and piercing sound effect of music at such a decibel that your ears bleed much as the characters in this film. The monster looks like a decently made mask but a mask none the less. But it's the story that's perhaps the worst thing this film has to offer.

If the movie shows up on TV to watch and you've already seen that episode of MAN VS FOOD three or four times, if the rerun of TYRA has something so disgusting you can't watch it or if Jerry Springer reruns feature someone normal as opposed to the usual weirdoes he normally has, then perhaps you could watch this. But better yet, turn off the TV and read a good book.",1332806400,,4764,4.436571428571429
4505599,2,B004Z2PLZS,"For some reason, a number of web sites, including the usually reliable IMDB (where I've submitted a correction), credit Lucy Hale as an actress in this movie.  She isn't, so don't watch, rent, or buy 'Scream of the Banshee' in hopes of seeing her. Perhaps the source of the confusion is Hale's appearance in 'Scream IV'.  In 'Scream of the Banshee,"" she's never on the screen, and her name does not appear in the opening or end credits (and Amazon does not list her in the credits above). I don't know about the cutting room floor, but I'm betting Hale was never connected in any way with this production.

As for this movie, it's not the worst I've seen and unfortunately seems fairly typical for what passes today for horror movies.  The high point would be Lauren Holly, who looks damned good and does as well as can be expected with the erratic material.  The low point would be Lance Henriksen, who does as badly as possible with the equally bad material he's given to work with. His character is a mess with no discernible motivation for a series of incomprehensible actions.  Some complain that he doesn't get a lot of screen time considering his sharing top billing with Holley.

The acting wasn't bad considering the dialog they had to work with, if you just need to fill some time go for it, but really don't expect too much.

8449382,4,B004Z2PLZS,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2011 and directed by Steven C. Miller, ""Scream of the Banshee"" concerns events at a California university where a professor (Lauren Holly) and her two student-assistants (Todd Haberkorn & Leanne Cochran) uncover an Irish box from the 12th century, which unleashes a banshee, a wicked spirit that haunts & slays those who hear its piercing old hag screech. Lance Henriksen plays a nutjob former professor who might know the secret to stopping the banshee.

While Scream of the Banshee is limited by its budget, its pretty haunting and chilling TV horror. The banshee is effective in its hideous manifestations. Moreover, the movie does make you care for a couple of the protagonists and its heartbreaking when one buys the farm. Holly was exquisite back when she was in her prime and still looks pretty good (as of the time of this movie) but, for some odd reason, she chose to wear the same unflattering brown pants throughout practically the entire movie.

THE MOVIE RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. WRITERS: Anthony C. Ferrante & Jacob Hair. ADDITIONAL CAST: Marcelle Baer plays the daughter of the professor (Holly) while Eric F. Adams appears as a friend of the nutjob (Henriksen).

Presented by Syfy should've indicated that it wasn't going to be that good.  Being that I actually like some of the Afterdark movies, I gave this one a chance.  At the beginning of the movie when the banshee was captured by the Templar seemed promising, however, it just went downhill from there.  Problems with this movie(without giving much away) is it drags on in parts.  There's an over abundance of dialogue for starters.  The banshee itself does not appear much at all and stays invisible much of the time.  The red cloaked figure you see on the case only appears in the beginning and once throughout the rest of the film.  The movie tries to establish some conflict between mother and daughter which was unneeded.  The plot has so many holes its like swiss cheese.  There's no explanation as to why the antagonist professor wants the banshee unleashed and his videos that the kids and current professor watch can even be barely heard.  In conclusion, its disappointing since there's very few movies with banshees that this one had so much promise yet missed the mark entirely.  This is one of those rental movies.",1414972800,,1223,4.690140845070423
