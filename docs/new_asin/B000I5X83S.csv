3558532,5,B000I5X83S,"In this movie, as the title suggests, others can ""slip"" into this girl and she does things to help the people around her. Its a very dramatic movie. She has to protect the brother of a victim, get revenge on a couple of thugs, help a father who just lost is wife and figure out what she needs too. All the while this maniac is watching her, following her and eventually catches up with her. If you like drama and believe in ghosts and such you will definitely love this movie!!",1238716800,3,477,4.252747252747253
3558533,4,B000I5X83S,"Slip is a thoughtful story made with a low budget.  Most of the acting is good, and I'd recommend this for someone who wants to try something new.  The movie does a good job of mixing genres.",1188604800,4,191,4.135135135135135
3558534,1,B000I5X83S,I do not understad why people rates high a horrible and boring movie like this. Don't waste your precious time...and save your money!,1182902400,,133,4.826086956521739
3558535,5,B000I5X83S,"Wow, I saw this film in the theatre and it really blew me away. Great acting, great story. There are really some actors in this film that should be superstars. I really enjoyed the original blending of story with a combination street story and ghost story they really put a new twist on the genre. A very solid pick. You should really check it out!",1158192000,5,348,4.369230769230769
8299927,3,B000I5X83S,"This was at best okay, the acting is very very bad, like really bad, it is low budget so that always gets a bit of a pass, the story is kind of used ""I see dead people and help them"" Not as in depth as Ghost whisper, but if you got a hour to blow and want a 90's feel badly acted movie, this is right there!",1510617600,,307,3.5970149253731343
8299928,4,B000I5X83S,"Would give this 4.5 stars. Well crafted story and well acted with believable characters. All of the actors were new to me and I enjoyed their performances. The ""bad"" guy following her was creepy as hell. This movie kept me interested thoroughout. Well worth the watch.

8299929,4,B000I5X83S,A good story line.  Not bad.,1509235200,,28,3.6666666666666665
8299930,5,B000I5X83S,"This is amazingly good.  A little hokey, maybe, and not particularly original but it's a great story and well presented.",1508630400,,120,5.0
8299931,5,B000I5X83S,"Fantastic movie for a ""B"" movie great storyline, the lady is beautiful and an excellent actress, the brother was awfully handsome and a good actor and the thugs were good too and lastly not leastly the music was great, especially ""save me"" song. Great movie!!",1507420800,2,259,4.777777777777778
8299932,4,B000I5X83S,"4 stars B movie rating, I would give it 3 stars all films considered.  Story lacked some originality but the script seemed well written most of the time, the acting was decent, and characters reasonably well developed.  I would watch it again sometime.  I loved the opening scene.",1506384000,2,280,4.791666666666667
8299933,2,B000I5X83S,"Sarah (Jill Small) sees dead people, talks to dead people, and lets dead people possess her. She carries a shotgun in case they are angry and want revenge. Her ""gift"" gets her involved with a group of criminals who run a chop shop.

The premise of the film was good, but the plot needed some tweaking as did the sound track. The acting was okay, the plot wasn't convincing, especially the ending.

Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity. Now available on DVD multi-packs.",1506384000,,466,4.602409638554217
8299934,5,B000I5X83S,"What a great indie film! Fresh take on the medium trope, with a solid script and fine actors. This isn't a scary movie, more of a thriller; it reminds me a little of the show ""Medium,"" but with violence and a drug cartel. There are a few schmaltzy moments, as one would expect from a movie in which spirits do their thing and then pass on, but they were pleasantly unlike the schlock on Ghost Whisperer (blech, hate that show).

I have no idea what their budget was, but they clearly made good use of it, which is too seldom the case with these little flicks. Post-production did a decent job with the tools they had. Overall, this gets an A for effort, but I can't help but be sad that they didn't have Hollywood money for this project. Slip is much better than most of the supernatural thrillers I've seen in theaters in recent years and could easily have earned a lot of $$ if it'd had a wide theatrical release and a marketing budget. The downside to that, though, is that they'd also have gone with big-name actors -- Jennifer Gardner would be the obvious lead -- which would have denied the cast the opportunity to do such a great job in Slip. I hope being Prime gives them a boost. I know quite a few other people who would enjoy this movie!",1505692800,3,1248,4.31063829787234
8299935,3,B000I5X83S,"A B movie that held my interest enough to watch to the end.  While sometimes corny, the characters seem to have tried their best.  I enjoyed the movie and liked the plot line.  Can't blame them for not enough money to create a movie of quality.  Give it a try.",1505520000,,260,4.14
8299936,4,B000I5X83S,"Excellent supernatural suspenseful movie! Great story, Well acted....believable characters...some amazing twists!",1504742400,2,113,9.363636363636363
