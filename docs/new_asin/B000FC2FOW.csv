8411051,5,B000FC2FOW,"Fun routine, fast pace energetic, comes with music CD but you need to edit it to work with the routine.  Mike does a good job of breaking down all the steps, be sure to check out the extras, close up of the feet from behind step by step.  Only thing missing is he does not run through the whole routine from behind so when you try to follow it at full speed you have to look over your shoulder at the television monitor or do everything opposite, can be very frustrating when learning.  Highly recommend the DVD, lots of great extras.  Take your time learning the steps; it took me about 6 weeks to learn the first routine working on it about 2-3 hours a week.",1245456000,,660,4.214285714285714
