7834987,2,6303046460,"Huh. This was certainly an interesting movie, although not the best of the psychological-thriller drama. I actually played a minute role (Kristi Collins) and remember the whole production and premis as very scary, but also very sophisticated. Twelve or so years later, I find this movie a bit disjointed. Still, it is well worth the buck fifty to check it out from a small town video store and watch. That is, if one is not looking for something too intellectually taxing.",1090195200,5,472,4.839506172839506
7834988,5,6303046460,"This movie is a classic. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Scott Glenn is superb as the detective and his character son, 11 year old Jessie, is impressive.
This story can be non fictional. There's a lot of demented people out there today.
This maniac that they are pursuing is so twisted. He is a monster. The things he does is horrifying. And the ending is a shocker. This film is becoming hard to find. Get it before it's too late.",1081123200,16,442,4.211764705882353
7834989,4,6303046460,"I haven't seen this movie in a while, in most part, because I couldn't find it.  Anyway, I saw it a long time ago and it was so cool. I was around 13, and an avid horror movie watcher.  I was never nervous to watch any type of horror around my parents, until this movie.  This movie is pretty gory and very entertaining.  It is very nerve racking and pretty suspenseful.",1038873600,14,370,4.169014084507042
