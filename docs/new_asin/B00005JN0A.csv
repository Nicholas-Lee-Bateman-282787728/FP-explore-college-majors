1495061,1,B00005JN0A,"I came in with high hopes on this movie seeing it first on DVD, especially the ""Unrated"" version since Old School's was so good, but all I got was a sick feeling to my stomach as I think I finally discovered when 'pushing the limit' can go too far.  I don't understand how the filmmakers can perceive full male nudity multiple times, an excessive amount of male touching, a child acting like a Nazi, destroying and downright offending the Vatican is funny.  Even the 'bonus' female nudity seemed to go on just long enough to make everyone feel awkward.  Granted there was some really funny parts throughout the movie, but by the end of it everyone in our group was too scared to watch in fear of seeing another male's butt on the screen.
I think the only thing it truly showed was how sick and deranged Hollywood can get to up the ante.  It's possible to have a sex-based teen comedy that actually has substance (go see ""Girl Next Door""), but that requires developing a plot that doesn't need cliches to make laughs.  I'd even place ""Tomcats"", ""Road Trip"", and every single ""American Pie"" before this.  Also, the original ending was WAY more believable and was actually a better finish, but they thought it wasn't a crowd pleaser - so they sold a movie cliche again!
I'm not a hater, I was just really disturbed by this movie and want to warn people to rent it before buying it!",1086134400,7,1378,4.492
1495062,5,B00005JN0A,Eurotrip was the funniest. The cast was hilarious and I am now an instant fan of Scott Mechlowicz. He gave a great performance and he's not bad on the eyes either. I hope him to see him in future movies.,1086134400,,203,4.1
1495063,5,B00005JN0A,"I liked Eurotrip. I seen it twice at the show and would give it three or three in a half stars. The extras you get on the DVD push it over the edge. There are over a dozen deleted scenes, most are really funny (probably should have been included in the film). God, how I wish they included the European O.J. commercial. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.
Besides the deleted scenes, there are just so many extras with this DVD; I'm shocked to get so much for twenty-bucks. I counted fifteen special feature menus and most of them are actually entertaining (rare in my opinion). The best extra is probably the bootleg copy of ""Eurotrip"" they put on the disk: ""we just bootleged the bootleger, so -you pirate"".
If you liked ""Eurotrip"" you'll enjoy this DVD. Even if you didn't care for it, or were on the borderline, you should consider picking it up. All the extras make this a whole new experience. If nothing else it will show you how little you really get with other DVD titles.",1086048000,4,984,4.441988950276243
1495064,4,B00005JN0A,"The creators of ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"" present the comic misadventures of four American teenagers in Europe in the outrageous teen comedy ""Eurotrip"" After a humiliating break-up with his cheating girlfriend Fiona (Kristen Kreuk), Scotty Thomas (Scott Mechlowics) learns that his German e-mail penpal is actually an attractive girl and embarks on a fun-filled trip across Europe with his buddies (Jacob Pitts, Travis Wester & Michelle Trachtenburg) to win her heart. Along the way, these four teenagers are taking in the sights and enjoying what the Old World has to offer. ""Eurotrip"" is the hilarious gross-out teen comedy of 2004. This wildly entertaining comedy features an amusing young cast and uproarious humor. ""Eurotrip"" also includes funny cameo appearances by Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), Lucy Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess), Vinnie Jones (Snatch) and Matt Damon (The Bourne Supremacy). Though it failed in theaters, ""Eurotrip"" has become one of the funniest raunchy teen comedies in the past years.

""Eurotrip"" Unrated Edition hits the mark. The extended cut of the 2004 teen comedy is presented in its 1.85:1 widescreen frame. The DVD contains an enjoyable video transfer and a clear Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. Among supplemental extras, the DVD includes a 5-minute gag reel, the short ""Nude Beach Exposed"" behind-the-scenes featurette, 13 deleted and extended scenes, ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" music video, photo gallery, handy unrated and nude scene indexes and two funny audio commentaries with the film's writers and director Jeff Schaffer. The interactive DVD menus are memorable. With its raunchy humor and worthy extras, ""Eurotrip"" Unrated Edition gets a ""B"".",1085356800,,1695,5.519230769230769
1495065,1,B00005JN0A,"Eurotrip might have been kinda funny a few years ago. Unfortunately, Road Trip and Old School, used in all the ads, beat it to the punch, and while neither of those are particularly intelligent movies either, they're much better than the nearly laughless hell that is Eurotrip.
The movie is overbearingly annoying to start with, using pointlessly loud and cluttered credit sequences that intend to be but are remarkably unfunny. From there, it segues into a concert that has a few amusing moments, but nothing of takeoff velocity. After that, the few high point include a couple of Snatch cast members (Rade Serbedgia and Vinnie Jones), and a song that actually manages to become a little more funny with each successive appearance.
Don't watch this dreck. Not only are Old School and Road Trip smarter and funnier, but this year's The Girl Next Door trumps all of them with more charming, witty and funny material. (And as an added black mark, the use of Old School and Road Trip's logos in the previews have resulted in the permanent cancellation of Old School 2...what a waste).",1083888000,9,1081,4.848648648648648

1495067,5,B00005JN0A,"If you're going to buy this dvd, make sure you buy it for the laughs and you won't be dissapointed.  In the tradition of OldSchool, Eurotrip goes all out in a wild story of true friendship as a group of american teens help their friend find his true love.  Tour Europe with this crazy quartet as they go from one impossible misadventure to another.  Nudity, sex, and just plain wierd circumstance are bound to entertain you.",1082851200,22,424,4.552631578947368
1495068,4,B00005JN0A,"Eurotrip is brought to us by the same people who brought us Road Trip and Old School, and it's not hard to tell.  Loaded with some predictable gags, ethnic stereotypes, and situations that could never ever happen in the real world; Eurotrip still manages to be the funniest film to be released yet this year.  High school graduate Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) takes off to Europe after being dumped by his girlfriend in search of an obscenely hot German girl who he thought was a guy.  Along with him are three of his friends: Cooper (Jacob Pitts, who closey emulates a young David Spade, both physically and comically), Jamie (Travis Wester), and Jenny (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Michelle Trachtenberg); all of whom travel from France to Amsterdam (naturally) and all over Europe getting into all kinds of mishaps.  While Eurotrip occasionally borderlines on stupidity, you won't be able to help yourself from laughing.  Featuring hilarious cameos from Matt Damon, Smallville's Kristin Kreuk, Lucy Lawless, and the always great Vinnie Jones.",1081900800,10,1040,5.1301775147929
1495069,5,B00005JN0A,"I've seen some past reviews of people that really hated this movie.  (...)
Dude, calm down.  Our culture is different than yours, and of course our humor is going to be different by poking fun at the sterotypes of other cultures.  You may not find it funny, but I guarantee that there are some movies that may be made that you would think are hilarious, whereas we would think as absolute and complete crap.  And enough with the ""stupid Americans"" because us ""stupid Americans"" think that Europeans are oftentimes just as bad if not worse in some respects.
With that out of the way...do not see this movie if you are easily offended.  Because if you are easily offended, you WILL get offended.  But, calm down, because it's supposed to be a societal satire of sorts.  I found this movie extremely hilarious, and I laughed at a lot of the jokes, despite that they were making fun of me (I'm Catholic and German thank you very much.)  I highly suggest this movie if you liked Old School or Road Trip.",1081123200,4,998,4.5055555555555555

Maybe it was my experiences which made it hilarious, which brought back memories, but I can't imagine any person not liking the movie. It is really a classic comedy movie, better than Old School and American Pie. It is filled with sight gags and classic one liners. The script isn't difficult to follow. The direction is easy.

The actors were likeable and really good. It's easy to find a synopsis of the movie so I won't bore you to death with that but I will give a quick run down. Boy gets dumped by girlfriend right after high school graduation for being too predictable. Boy drunkenly tells hot European pen pal to get lost thinking she's a guy only to realize his mistake the next morning. Boy then decides to fly to Europe with his friends to fix things with said pen pal and of course antics ensue as he tries to get to her. Obviously there's much more to the story but the best part is it will keep you laughing. I hate the predictable teeny bopper movies that make you cringe since you know what's coming.

I constantly reference this movie, and when people catch it there is an instant bond of hilarity between us.  My husband and I randomly quote it all the time to each other, and it always elicits a laugh.

The plot is simple(but the process of which is more complicated than you could imagine) Scotty lost his girlfriend and he is on an international trip to find his penpal whom he thinks is a man,turns out the penpal is a she. So Scotty & his buddy Cooper go to Europe to get to Berlin to find his dream girl,they then get caught up with some soccer hooligans who take em out of their way. They get caught up in craziness but  they meet up with the school friends Jamie and Jenny the twins. The trip takes them everywhere,on a crazy train ride with a creepy italian pervert,then hit Amsterdam to eat THC-free brownies but act like they are trippin'. They get dropped off in Bratislava where there 1.38 gets them to live like kings cuz the exchange rate. They wind up at the Vatican and make the world believe the pope kicked the bucket. They get robbed and the twins make out after being blackout drunk. All in the process of finding Scotts girl. So many funny antics and jokes throughout this movie,it will have you laughing from start to finish. The unrated version is this film. You will not be disappointed in watching/buying this film.

1496680,3,B00005JN0A,"Quick story blurb:  Scotty graduates from high school only be dumped by his girlfriend. He has a pen pal from Germany, he realizes is a girl and decides to go overseas to meet her.  Lots of crazy things happen along the way.

Overall, it's just an ok comedy.  There are some parts that are funny.  There are a few familiar faces like Fred Armisen, he was funny.  The robot scene was pretty good too.  It's a farce comedy so many of the bits are outlandish.  This version being the unrated version has more topless women in it.  It only mildly enhances the movie.  I remember this being funnier the first time I watched it, it still has funny parts on the next watch. I don't know, if you like this style of movie, it's fun.",1419292800,,723,4.288888888888889

This movie is a 2 hour journey through hilarity.

The plot is about a group of American high school kids who go to Europe to find one of their pen pals who the main character is in love with. They know she is in Berlin but they can't get a flight to Berlin. So they go to wherever they can get a flight to in Europe and figure they will just drive to Berlin from there. Except everything goes wrong. (It's a road comedy. There's a formula here. It works. Trust the process.) They end up taking a route through most of the larger European countries and causing every kind of chaos along the way.",1411689600,,998,4.275132275132275

That's fine, but it just doesn't work as well as the scene in the theatrical version.

1497475,5,B00005JN0A,"Eurotrip holds up reasonably well.  I remember watching it back in 2004 and laughing nonstop.  Of course I'm 30 years old now so it's much easier for me to realize the style of laughter is more appropriate for the younger crowd.  The teenage jokes just don't appeal to me the same way nowadays.  However I can overlook much of the sillier and pointless stuff and focus on the well put together storyline.  As soon as the teens make their way to Europe, this is when the laughs REALLY begin.  Before this it's just a typical teenage environment that can be seen in plenty of other teen films.

The story is about the one teenager on a quest to search for a German girl he desperately wants to be in a relationship with.  He doesn't travel alone of course- he brings his dim-witted friend and incredibly hot female friend who goes by the name Michelle Trachtenberg (a highly original last name if I do say so myself!  One I can't pronounce either, haha!)

Well since it's a comedy, the gang of course find themselves in a few unusual and unpleasant situations.  The most memorable is the naked beach scene.  They think they're going on a nude beach to spot naked women but... they discover something very different and VERY wrong, haha.  The torture device segment involving the one friend is another notable highlight.  Oh, and the train ride with the extra friendly passenger is worth noting.  It's a little gross though!  Perhaps the jokes related to the Pope are a little TOO offensive.  I can't say I found any of this very funny at all.  They went too far here.

Overall, a wonderful storyline that increases in the laughs steadily which is actually what a good comedy should always strive to accomplish.  I highly recommend it.",1331942400,,1732,4.616393442622951

Like any decent movie, acting has to be top notch to get all the subtlties and these actors deliver.

If you enjoy comedies or have a decent sense of humor, this is one of those movies that, after viewing, you'll say to yourself ""that was pretty good. I'd like to see it again"".  There are many, many comedies made in Hollywood and they usually fall into one of three categories: A. Must see B. Worth watching C. Doesn't deliver.

1497550,3,B00005JN0A,"I think the endearing quality story line in this film is great to see.  Far many other movies don't go sappy at all, while this does tend to do so a bit much, there is nothing wrong with that.  What is wrong with going sappy?  You either enjoy romantic story lines or you don't believe in romance.  Romance has died among most contemporary films.  Contemporary story lines have become more cliche though as they are now the norm. They often ignore the basis of desire for another person or longing which is not an outdated concept.  On the other hand I did find a stereotype Euro experience placed in this film that stripped a layer of realistic understanding. It made fun of the expectations that many uninformed Americans might have, just as many outsiders of the globe might have on the U.S.  Yes those misunderstandings of us exist as well.

All in all would I consider this movie horrible?  no.  Would I have bought it if it didn't come in a combo with another movie I did want? no.  Understanding that a movie of this sort isn't being built on realistic expectations and is only after a laugh, then it more than lives up to expecations.  It could have gone into many horrible cliches of stereotypes but it did manage to put a new spin on them.  I say it is a reasonably enjoyable film.  A truly groundbreaking film only comes along once in a great while and even then if you break them down, they still are just another retold story.  What matters is if they do it in a manner that affects you.  As far as movies aimed solely at guys, it will fail to impress with the movies packaging.  Guys wouldnt care to see what they can see any day in the mirror but then again I guess, it does thing outside the box so you don't know what to expect.  It would have been better with the full release of more female bodies though in the face of what was shown.

While my experience in Europe didn't quite end up like the experiences in this movie, I felt uniquely and oddly suited to this film.

This film was made by my contemporaries and was inspired by those sex comedies where the main character travels with his friends to get sex and is confronted with broadly drawn sterotypes that get in the way of his having sex along the way.

There are very few comedies that make me laugh upon multiple viewing. When our guests are in the mood for a comedy we pull this out and reliably people are laughing out loud. Whether it is the mime bit, discovering the red light district with Lucy Lawless, or a hilarious cameo by Matt Damon -- it is funny each time I see it.

Yes. There are shameless, shameless, shameless stereotypes of Europeans. My European friends just need to get a sense of humor and realize that it doesn't come from a pejorative or mean place. There is shameless nudity (both female and male), but I really don't see this as much of a problem, unless you yourself have a problem with it. It is primarily nudity for humor rather than anything else.

I loved this movie!  It took us where Roadtrip wishes it could have taken us!  I really liked the ""scenery"" along the way.

I didn't rent this movie for the longest time, as the cover showed some goofball white dude pointing his fingers in a funny way with this goofy smile (he almost looked mentally handicapped) and it just looked so ""dumb."" Honestly.  But the cover of the unrated version, shows the young female actress removing her bikini top, and it looks damn hot!  Also, the unrated version has a ton more sexy scenes, including lots of nudity.  I also believe this is the first DVD I've rented that gave an index of the nude scenes, as well as an index for the additional ""unrated"" scenes.  Now that''s hot!

The movie was very funny, and put together well.  I felt like they were actually in Europe, and when you watch some of the special features, you learn that they actually were.  I felt like hit every country they said they were in, but something tells me it was only 1 or 2, and they used stage sets.  But, the scenes were all realistic looking.  I especially noticed this at the Vatican.  That was damn funny!

Some other reviewers are comparing this to other American clowning movies, but I didn't see it that way.  I saw it as us making fun of their stereotypes.  I mean how could you have a sex comedy in Europe, and not have a Berlin or Netherlands comedy scene.  And that scene where the Italian businessman keeps molesting the tourists?  I have a roommate that said an Italian man kept chasing her and molesting her on a city bus, so yes, stereotypes are based on some aspects of reality.  Get over your PC correctness?  Okay?  It's funny, because its partially true!

I can remember friends of mine talking about drinking worm wood or smoking weed in Holland.  But the main point I feel is how the movie relates to each one of us.  Maybe we as highschool graduates or alumni yet to come can't relate to drugs, drinking, travel, or even parting. But instead relate to adventure. The adventure of walking off the stage and going into the real world and trying to put some of the studies to the test. This is what makes Eurotrip so rememberal.

From ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" sung by Matt Damon, to the soccar hooligan opening beer bottles with his eye sockets, to the 'safe word"", to the great exchange rate in Bratislava, this movie had me in tears I was laughing so hard.

The actors are all very good, especially Michele Trachtenberg, who shows some great skin along with great comedic timing and expressions.

1497848,4,B00005JN0A,"`Eurotrip' is a farce, something you look at and just enjoy. That's it. You may hate the stereotyped images of Europe - soccer hooligans in England or sexy ladies in Amsterdam, well, that is understandable. And people in Italy would most naturally dislike some part of the film, and so are those in Germany, where, according to the film, boys strut at their home like Adolf. I don't say I like everything in the film, but I admit that it has some hilarious moments thanks to the surprisingly good four leading actors.

The four leads are Scott Mechlowicz as nice but ""predictable"" guy Scott, Jacob Pitts as perpetually horny guy Cooper, Travis Wester as geeky guy Jamie (with an expensive camera and a travel guidebook), and Michelle Trachtenburg as Jenny, sister of Jamie (and for Cooper she is not a girl). Scott finds that his on-line pen pal was actually a woman, not a male, and decides to fly to Germany. But naturally he cannot go there without lots of misadventures involving his friends.

As you know, `Eurotrip' is like a string of goofy sketches written by three writers Alec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer - all behind `Cat in the Hat.' Oh, but wait, please don't run away. Surely all the ideas are based on silly ideas and the gags themselves are sometimes hit and sometimes miss. The script is untidy but largely enjoyable because of the charms of the likable main characters. These characters are not particularly original, but no one hates the idea of watching Michelle Trachtenbur in bikini, right?

It is easy to ridicule the film, and call it a Dreamwork's belated attempt to do something like `American Pie' (probably it is), but the cheer and fun are undeniable. And it must be pointed out that before the recent trend of Hollywood's goofy comedies begin, Europe also did many sex comedies that are equally goofy during the 60s and 70s. No matter what we say, the tradition of silly farces would continue, and we keep watching them. It is what we call guilty pleasure, and I enjoyed it.

My favorite sketch is `The Robot-fighting in Paris.' You get additional fun from the cameo of Matt Damon, Vinnie Jones, and Joanna Lumley (in the end credit). Awfully silly but fun.",1137974400,2,2197,4.713541666666667

It's funnier than European Vacation and American Pie, and about on par with Road Trip. Do you care?

 Hey, how about the plot: Scott (Scott (!) Mechlowicz) has just been dumped by his girlfriend Fiona, who publicly humiliates him at the graduation party with her boyfriend (a freakin' sweet cameo by Matt Damon) with the song Scotty Doesn't Know. Meanwhile, Scott has been communicating with pen pal Mieke (Jessica Boehrs), who he calls Mike and believes is a guy. When Mieke comes on to him online and Scott turns her down with disgust, though, he realizes his mistake and travels with buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) to Germany with ""the twins"" (Michelle Trachtenberg, Travis Wester), stopping in Amsterdam for hash brownies (or are they?) and a freaky visit to Club Vandersexxx; going to a nude beach with all guys; taking a train ride with a creepy Italian (SNL member Fred Armisen); drinking with a group of drunken Brits (led by Vinnie Jones); and destroying the Vatican with the fake death of the Pope and a fire. Does Scott end up with Mieke? The makers changed the ending so they do (wow, a big surprise!)

 Anyway, this movie is no classic, but it's a lot funnier than the previous effort of writers Alec Berg & David Mandel and writer/director Jeff Schaffer, a little movie called the Cat in the Hat.

The blooper reel while the credits are rolling is great! I love the little old lady giving advice to Scotty and Miki while they are making love in the confessional!

 Now being over 30 yrs of age I would have to agree with some of the reviewers here and say that this movie is the Porky's of THIS generation. The comparisons with both the american pie series and girl next door is really stupid. This movie is a stand alone movie and should be view as such and with a open mind.

 The story has been told over and over again in the reviews so IF you want or are looking for a rehash about it, read the reviews. Also Freddie Prince Jr and David Spade are too old to play in this movie but the producers did pick two new up and coming actors that will probably be the next generation Freddie Prince Jr and David Spade.

 As for the reviews who think this is a career killer for Lucy Lawless, She is enjoying playing bit parts in movies like Spiderman and EuroTrip and making guest appearances on TV besides she is married to a movie director and will probably appear in minor roles in all his movies that he directs, that plus all the money she made playing Xena Warrior Princess. Lucy can afford to relax and take care of her two kids if she chooses.

 I enjoyed this movie with the running joke in it about the song ""Scotty doesnt know"" and other running gags like the Pope watching his replacement on TV after being 'elected' within 10~20 minutes of his 'alleged' death and the little salutes to other movies and tv shows:

  I.E. Cooper's white suit in that european night club paying homage to James Bond or Miki's step brother doing a hitler impersonation in the background while the father and Scotty talk in the foreground is like watching early episodes of Family Guy with Stewie doing something the the background while the adults talk in the foreground.

  I wonder IF this movie was to be made now if the FIGHTING MANCHESTER UNITED would appear in the movie knowing what Malcom Glazer did to the team. (IF you live in Tampa the name is extremely familar to buc fans and taxpayers here) or the ending joke about the Pope's ""death"" would be changed or not.

Matt Damon also does a cameo while singing ""Scottie Doesn't Know,"" which, amazingly stays with you throughout the day.  Eventually, you're lead to humming this song because it's played throughout the movie even ""techno"" style in Bratislava, Czech Republic.

It's a typical teenager love/dump/crush/sex story with a lot of added spunk,nudity, and hormones.  The best parts are the human-robot, the perverted-Italian-man in the train, Vatican City, and the nude beach scenes are those to laugh out loud to and contemplate. The funniest part are the bloopers that play when the credits roll, so watch out for those.

 The movie was hilarious, and Trachtenberg wasn't annoying at all. She was surprisingly likeable as the only female in the group (will wonder ever cease?).

1497909,4,B00005JN0A,"For anyone who loved the inane teen comedies ROAD TRIP or AMERICAN PIE here comes EUROTRIP, a movie that succeeds in actually insulting a large portion of Europe, but gets you so lost in its sense of fun that you can overlook its lack of diplomatic tact.
Graduating from high school Scott seems to have it all, at least he has an incredible looking girlfriend (played in a cameo by SMALLVILLE's Kristin Kreuk). But there he is getting dumped by said girlfriend on the day of graduation and (adding insult to injury) finding out through the lyrics of a rock song (shades of BOYS AND GIRLS here) that she has been cheating on him.
Retreating home bruised from this encounter with reality Scott relates his woes to his German penpal - a guy we are told is named Mike.
The response comes back flirtatious and spurred on by his best friends homophobic comments Scott insults his transatlantic friend. Its only when he realizes (thanks to his younger brother who seems to know better German than he does) that Mike is actually Mieke and a girl (and girl in the hot shape of Jessica Boehrs at that) that Scott resolves that he must win her at all costs.
So there he goes with friend in tow to Europe. Stopping first in London they come into contact and in an unlikely turn of events befriend a group of English soccer hooligans (led by the always fun to watch Vince Vaughn). Making their way across the continent (in a manner which would have made the Griswolds proud) they team up with their vacationing High School friends (which include BUFFY's Michelle Trachtenberg) before Scott can finally confess his true feelings to Mieke.
If comedies are rated by how much you actually laugh then EUROTRIP certainly scored with me. Perhaps I was in just a funny mood, but I found moments of the movie to be side splittingly funny. The movie takes some getting started, but once it hits Europe and we are into definite culture clash territory (ala CROCODILE DUNDEE and WHAT A GIRL WANTS) then the laughs come thick and fast.",1122422400,3,2009,4.614525139664805

Well, I dunno why he wouldnt have used a voice on messenger or webcam, but i guess it's needed for the plot. So he realises shes a she and he wants her and she has blocked his e-mail. So instead of using as different e-mail to send to her to explain, him and his David Spade wanna-be friend go to Europe to find her.

They meet up with some more friends and have a tough time going through Europe. The things they get up to.

Ups: The confession booth scene is funny.

Downs: Bonus materials arnt worth looking at, the gag reel isn't funny, the deleted scenes where deleted for a good reason and the featurettes are average.

The movies OK, but nothing speciel. It really needed something that made it really stick out to have been really notable. Like the pie-scene of American Pie or the kissing scene of Not Another Teen Movie. But this movie is along the same lines of those kind of films. It does try to make a scene like those, but there just not so much funny as seen as trying too hard.

1498003,4,B00005JN0A,"A 2004 movie.  ""Unrated Version"" contains both male and female nudity (includes some hot women and large number of men (men at nude beach)).

DVD Features: The DVD contains an unrated version of the movie and some Special Features.  The Special Features include: Commentaries (two versions: Filmmakers' Commentary and Party Along Commentary); a gag reel; deleted scenes (with or without commentary and includes 13 deleted scenes); Alternate Ending (with or without Commentary); a helpful Nude Scene Index (apparently 10 scenes (the index involves a picture and an down arrow)); Unrated Scene Index (8 scenes; if this index is correct, then the R rated theater version must not have had much if any nudity); Nude Beach Exposed (something of a ""documentary"" of the scene); a featurette called ""How to Pick a Director"" (apparently all three writers worked together and they had to chose one to be credited as the director); ""Eurotrip Bootleg"" (writers commentary for a Chinese bootleg copy of the movie); ""The Music of Eurotrip"" (an ad for the soundtrack; a music video; and a ""Sing-A-Long""); Photo Gallery; Script; Production Notes; Cast bios; and the filmmakers biography.

Plot: The movie opens with some students graduating from high school and a one of the student's (Scott) getting dumped by his girlfriend, Fiona (""Smallville's"" Kristin Kreuk).  After this dumping sequence, Scott and friends go to a graduation party, where Fiona's music boyfriend plays a song about Fiona (Scott is boring and Fiona is a tramp).  While Scott's friends (the twins; Cooper plans on working at a law firm) plan on backpacking in Europe, Scott plans on staying home and working.  This changes when his German ""pen pal"" invites ""himself"" to America.  Scott freaks out that the ""man"" wants to ""sleep"" with him.  This German, ""Mike,"" helped Scott in German class.  And Scott had been confused, it wasn't Mike but Mieke (a female; it is momentarily funny when Scott realizes that Mieke is female, and he had sent an e-mail basically blowing her off).  Scott decides to head off to Europe with his friend Cooper as couriers to try to meet Mieke after she blocks his e-mail (she lives in Germany; they are sent to London and assume they can ""walk"" to Berlin, and Cooper hasn't told his law firm that he is off to Europe).  Remember, the rest of the gang, the twins, are also heading to Europe on a backpacking trip (though they don't head over together, they join each other's groups in Paris).  The gang has a lot of adventures in Europe, including scenes in night clubs, trains and nude beaches, and then the movie ends.

Credits: The movie stars Scott Mechlowisz (Scott Thomas), Michelle Trachtenberg (Jenny; from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV show), Jacob Pitts (Cooper Harris; ""K-19""), Jessica Boehrs (Mieke; musical artist in Germany); Travis Wester (Jamie; ""Beverly Hills 90210""), Lucy Lawless (Madame Vandersexxx; ""Xena""), Vinnie Jones (Head Hooligan; ""Snatch""), and Fred Armisen (Creepy Italian Guy; ""Anchorman"").  Jenny and Jamie are supposed to be twins.  The credited director is Jeff Schaffer.

Review: Interesting opening credit sequence, displaying the credits against an animated airline safety pamphlet, though the music is a little annoying.  Somewhat annoyingly, the ""fourth wall"" is broken and one of the kids (Cooper, the ""hard"" or ""bad"" member of the group) notes ""there's your R rating right there"" when he spots some nude women in a hot top at the graduation party (though Cooper certainly knows how to talk a topless woman, who doesn't particularly like him, to fondle herself in front of him).

The film is a comedy and there are some amusing moments, some of which are down right funny (especially the scene where Jamie is robbed in Amsterdam; and the scene where Scott attempts to speak German with a truck driver).  There are actually some more funny moments than I expected, but most of the moments just cause a brief laugh.  Some of the scenes, though some scenes have a tendency to go on too long.

The acting is good enough for this type of movie, though not the best in the world.  The music includes some of the same music also appeared in National Lampoon's European Vacation.  Let's see, they visit London, Paris, some French village (""famous nude beach"" location), Amsterdam, the capital of Slovakia, Berlin and Rome.  For the most part, the settings look like they might actually be in Europe, but few landmarks are spotted to confirm the location.

1498009,5,B00005JN0A,"Alright I saw this movie the day it came out, with two of my friends.  I have never laughed so hard in the movies my entire life, and I'm not just saying that.  The humor in Eurotrip is funny, clever and yes, exaggerated but its still a good time.  I've seen a lot of reviews who have bashed it because they didn't film on location.  Who cares?  It bugs me when they do something like that with Cold Mountain, a film about the American civil war filmed in Austria (I think), but Eurotrip is a comedy, I'm not going to be looking for every tiny detail.  Let's save that for the historical films.  Eurotrip in short is a very funny film to watch especially with friends.

 The extras here are great too, but the unrated title throws you off a bit.  First off, none of the unrated stuff is included within the film itself, its all about the actual extras and menus and stuff.  There is a Nude Scene index just for kicks.  But my favorite extra would have to be the Chinese Bootleg, which they threw on for a variety of reasons, the directors talk about it, but the main reason its there is because its just so dam funny to watch, it's absolutely terrible.

My Name is Scott and judging from the title of my review, the only thing that I do not like about this movie is the whole Scotty Doesn't Know song.  After this came out nobody, made a big deal about it, but a few months afterwards, everybody started singing it as soon as I walked into the room.  One could imagine it can be very annoying, especially when someone does it and they think they are the first to do it.  Yes it's quite original.  *sarcasm*

Despite the song being annoying, the fad of singing it has seemed to have died out, so I have nothing against this film any more.  It's odd because most of the teenage sex films like American Pie just annoyed me, but this one had something to it.  The characters, or at least most of them were believable.  And it is a bit of reflection of the world's society as how one interprets another.  Heck the creepy Italian guy thought there was nothing wrong with what he did, he was just behaving as he always does, but then again his character is highly exaggerated.  I'll cut to the point; my review is as long enough as it is.  Buy or rent today, and get a crowd of friends together as you watch it, you will not be disappointed in the slightest.

... Europe, well, Rome is situated at the place where you usually will find Moscow when you take a look at the map and Amsterdam has nothing to do with the real Dutch capital. Amsterdam looks like Venice!

Europe seen through American eyes... You want to travel from London to Paris? Walking, swimming, it only takes a few hours. Old Europe is so small, Paris is a suburb of Berlin. Hehe... of course they blow it up all the time, which makes it all quite predictable, but for Europeans it's extremely amusing to be faced with the so-called American thoughts about Europe.

I must admit that I never have been in America, so perhaps all my  prejucides about this huge country should be dumped by me. Otherwise I'll travel with the same stupid attitude as the 4 American 'Eurotrippers' use to do, haha!

1498110,3,B00005JN0A,"Ahh... an R-rated teen comedy... haven't seen those in a while.

This is just a stupid, silly, and often funny movie. If you're just up for some laughter and don't care about intelligence or are just looking for a getaway moment, ""Eurotrip"" may be a possible choice for ya.

Basically the movie centers around four hormone-driven teens out looking to get laid and party... but it also has a minor plotline interjected into their lil' post-high school graduation vacation. Our ""hero"" Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) had a rough high school graduation day since his girlfriend dumped him just after he graduated. But Scotty isn't alone for long. He's got a German Internet ""pen-pal"" that he writes to constantly. Scotty's buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) thinks that this German dude is just trying to ""hook-up"" with Scotty, who is convinced later on and sends a nasty e-mail to his German friend. Unfortunately, the German friend isn't a dude at all, but rather a ""hot-looking"" German ""babe."" Now Scotty wants to go overseas to find his ""true love.""

Two other buddies join Scotty and Cooper's getaway (eventually... by accident), one a guy named Jamie (Travis Wester) and his sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenburg), both that're called the ""worst twins"" and Scotty and Jacob think Jenny isn't a girl.

Our characters run into trouble and the s**t hits the fan plenty of times. Of course, sometimes the laughs don't come out at all when jokes fall flat on their face or something is just God-awfully stupid it's just not funny... but somehow, you may still manage to chuckle out a laugh or smile.

Perhaps I had an enjoyable day when I watched this movie, but it's the kind of movie that has so many mistakes and stereotypical remarks with some lame jokes that makes it so bad that it's actually worth watching. The actors and actresses pull off their parts well (particularly Jacob Pitts, who's character is obviously the best in the movie) and features numerous cameos from Matt Damon to Lucy Lawless.

So if you're up for a getaway movie, maybe ""Eurotrip"" could be a consideration.

1498116,3,B00005JN0A,"The ""Eurotrip"" DVD has a Nude Scene Index as a special feature, which tells you what the makers of the film think is the strength of this 2004 comedy, to wit, the jokes might not work and the characters might not be interesting, but we have naked people.  More importantly, them have made them easily accessible for your viewing pleasure, so what more could you really ask for in a movie?  Oh, do not get me started on that score.

The movie starts off as Scott Thomas (Scott Mechlowicz) has a really bad graduation day.  His girl friend, Fiona (Kristin Kreuk) dumps him and shows up at a party with her boyfriend, Donny (Matt Damon), whose not only in the band but has written a infectious new song called ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" that explains how in the dark our hero has been (there is both a sing along and a music video for this song by Lustra in the special features).  Then, to add insult to injury, he breaks off his e-mail relationship with Mieke, because he is convinced by his friend Cooper Harris (Jacob Pitts) that Mieke is a gay German guy who is just trying to hit on him.  Then his little brother Bert (Nial Iskhakov) explains that ""Mieke"" is not the German short version of Michael but rather of Michelle.  So Mieke is a hot young German blond woman who thinks that Scotty could be ""the one,"" and Scotty has just blown her off.  Apparently there is a lot that Scott doesn't know, including basic German.

This turn of events explains why Mieke has blocked Scotty's e-mail and why he decides that the most important thing in the world is getting to Berlin to meet Mieke in the flesh, so to speak.  Cooper finds a way to get Scotty to England and comes along for the trip.  Since Europe is a fairly small ""country,"" they manage to hook up with their friends, the twins, brother Jamie (Travis Wester), who carries around the Frommer travel guide even though he has committed it to memory, and sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg), who is considered one of the guys for some long that we are supposed to believe nobody (i.e., Cooper) has noticed she is a girl.

At this point it becomes clear that the idea of this movie is to send the quartet to a recognizable European city and have them get a taste of the local culture and still get out of town alive.  But the big problem with this movie is that most of their problems have to do with sexual deviance.  That means the creepy Italian guy (Fred Armisen) who likes to wait for the train to go through a tunnel so he can sexually assault strangers and Madame Vandersexx (Lucy Lawless) at a S&M club (bring a flyer, get a free t-shirt).  Apparently the idea is that if people go to Europe to have sex rather than see museums, then they deserve to be punished by having horrible things happen to them, and while that sounds like a worthwhile position to take in these troubled times, it is not really that funny.  Neither is the idea that being homophobic is a necessary survival skill for daily living.

Unfortunately ""Eurotrip"" saves the draw-droppingly bad part of the film for the climax, which I am sure seemed like a good idea at the time.  It takes place at the Vatican, which is a strange enough location to pick for our hero to finally catch up with the woman he loves, but as soon as a tour guide points out that the fancy rope behind the glass door is attached to bell that is only rung to announce the death of the Pope, you know things are not going to go well.  The fact that the chimney in the Sistine Chapel is not connected to a fireplace in St. Peter's Basilica certainly bothered me and while there may well be confessionals in the Vatican I have a hard time believing they would be used for such secular purposes.

Another problem is that teenage girls have been played by young women in their 20s for so long that when you have an actual 18-year-old actress playing an 18-year-old character like Michelle Trachtenberg does in this movie, she still seems like a kid sister.  Besides, she also seems too smart to end up making the choice she ends up making just to have a European sexual experience (By the end of the film the lesson seems to be that those who cannot have sex in Europe only deserve to have sex with others who could not have sex in Europe, like it was an attempt to weed out a regressive gene or something).  After ""Just Married"" it was obvious that the only way for comedies about Americans traveling through Europe to go would have to be up, but who expected such a small incremental step like this movie?  But then 2004 was a really wretched year for comedies, especially at those aimed at the pocketbooks of the youth of America.

There are some decent extras on this one, and not just because it takes a while to get to the point where you have heard ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" too much.  However, I have to admit I was disappointed that they only had a few scenes from the bootlegged version of ""Eurotrip"" that the writers found in New York City three months before the official DVD release (I have found memories of the bootlegged version of ""Return of the Jedi,"" with the camera trying to keep up with the talking heads being on the left and then the right in the final scene between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker).

Nude beaches: nudity isn't a big deal to Europeans.  The only leering [...] you'll find at the nude beaches are American tourists.  EVERYONE else acts like its no big deal.

Hash Bars in Amersterdam.  There's no way you could mistake one for anything else, or vice versa.  A bakery mistaken for a hashbar?  Give me a break!

Brothels in Amsterdam:  again, they're not anything like they're dipicted in this movie.  The women sit dressed in lingerie in store front windows.  Plus, the Dutch are so polite and professional (even the prostitutes) that the entire situation dipicted in the film is totally absurd.

Soccer hooligans:  they typically start riots at Soccer games, not in pubs.  Even if you were to wander in to a pub that was frequented mostly by locals who didn't like outsiders, the worst thing that would happen is that you would just be ignored.

Yes, Eastern Europe is impoverished when compared to Western Europe, but the exchange rates aren't that good.  If they were, everyone would go there.

It's not that they don't try, I think they just try to hard to be funnier than 80's comedies like 'Revenge of the Nerds', but fall short.

Scotty graduates from high school and gets dumped by his girlfriend who is supposedly the biggest slut in the world, but he doesn't know. So all through the movie we get to hear the ""Scotty doesn't know"" song. He is email penpals with a German girl named Mike, but he doesn't know it's a girl. Which is stupid from the get go, how could you not tell the sex of someone after lots of writing? It takes his little brother to tell him.

So to make a long story short, he and his friends end up in Europe to find his Mike. They have a run-in with the Manc soccer team in England, a dominatrix nightmare in Amsterdam, an all-male nude beach, a French Robot mime, and end up burning the pope's hat. Of course we have the lovey dovey happy ending where Mike decides to go to school in America to be with Scott. She is placed in his room because the school thought she was a guy. I think the alternate ending was much more believable, but if you want realism, this is not the movie to watch.

1498183,4,B00005JN0A,"""Eurotrip"" is a cheeky little sex farce that is far more endearing and amusing than it has any real right to be.  Think of this as basically ""International Pie,"" with four high school grads spending their final summer before college on a wild sex-capade through Europe.

Writers Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer have penned a surprisingly clever screenplay, filled with ribald humor and irreverent, keen-eyed satire.  As director, Shaffer keeps the energy level high and the tone so innocently upbeat that material that could easily have become sleazy and smarmy in less gifted hands becomes genuinely hilarious and utterly good-natured in his.  Even when a particular scene or joke falls flat, there is always a clever zinger or ingenious comic concept coming right along behind it to keep the film moving steadily along on the right track.  And some of the scenes are very funny indeed, with the film, as a whole, providing more hearty belly laughs than almost any comedy in recent memory.  Those easily offended by nudity and a casual attitude towards sex may want to take a pass on this film, but the rest of us will find much to laugh at in this broad little romp.

As the New World quartet suddenly let loose on the unsuspecting Old World, Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Michelle Trachtenberg and Travis Wester deliver performances filled with unflagging energy and youthful high spirits.  The fun these actors obviously had making the film is visible up there on the screen for all to see, making ""Eurotrip,"" for all its potential crassness, a surprisingly upbeat movie experience.

One could easily damn ""Eurotrip"" with faint praise by calling it a ""guilty pleasure.""  But that would be demeaning the people who put this very fun movie together.  ""Eurotrip"" is a high-energy, thoroughly entertaining comedy in its own right, one that needs no backhanded compliments or half-hearted apologies to detract from its very genuine virtues.",1097971200,102,1950,5.043613707165109

For instance, what the hell was that 'stop word' in that S&M scene?? It didn't even look Dutch. And why was their German music in the background?? The Netherlands are DUTCH not German!! And where the hell was that scene situated?? Amsterdam?? That was no Amsterdam. I don't even think that was the Netherlands were they shot that!! And then oddly enough I see a Dutch traffic sign in the 'collage' edit when we enter Berlin. And then flying east from Berlin to Rome?? Since when did Italy move up north/east?? And since when is the San marco bell of the San Marco church in the Vatican Museum? Or actually was it the Saint Peter or maybe some other place?? Cause when our hero Scott finally sees his German girl through the window whe see a reflection of the St. Peter in the window but when he enters the balcony it turns out that that balcony is from the St. peter as the camera zooms out......It was all a bit of confusing for me.

In the breakup aftermath, Scotty tells off his German pen pal in a drunken stupor in an email only to discover that the pen pal is a hot German girl.  Along with three friends, Scotty heads to Europe to win back his lost love.  This is by no means a great movie, but still it has its moments.

Jenny is the quiet, unassuming friend and Jamie has memorized a guidebook so he will not miss anything during the trip.  Eurotrip has plenty of great cameos including Matt Damon as a punk rocker, Lucy Lawless as a sexual dominatrix Cooper meets in Amsterdam, Vinnie Jones as a Manchester United soccer hooligan, Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Hytner, Diedrich Bader, and Fred Armisen.  Also starring are Kristen Kruek and Jessica Bohrs.  The Unrated DVD offers widescreen presentation, audio commentary, a gag reel, and deleted scenes.

1498237,3,B00005JN0A,"Another in a long line of ""American Pie""-type high school/college ""party movies"", Eurotrip takes the basic plot of its predecessor, Road Trip, and places it in a European setting.  While this offering is funny in its own right, it's not as memorable as Road Trip, although it is a bit raunchier.

Fresh from graduating high school, Scotty is dumped by his girlfriend.  Soon after, he discovers (albeit in weird fashion) that his German penpal is his true love, and in a moment of spontenaiety, decides to travel to Berlin to meet her.  He tows his sex-starved best friend Cooper along, and they meet up with other friends, fraternal twins Jenny and Jamie (note: the ""worst twins ever"").  Every stereotypical thing about each place they visit along the way (of note, Amsterdam, London, Paris, and Bratislava(!)) is shined upon, and attempted hilarious mayhem ensues in each locale as Scotty tries to hook up with the girl of his dreams while avoiding international incidents.  Cameos abound in this flick, from Matt Damon (see if you can recognize him) to Lucy Lawless to Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show), which adds to the fun.

Eurotrip has a couple of drop-dead funny moments, but for the most part this film tries to capitalize on the frat-house demographic success of Road Trip, and falls just short.  Jacob Pitts (Cooper) tries to recreate one of the roles that made Seann William Scott famous, and though he brings a sort of uniqueness to his character, he's just not as good at the sidekick role as Scott.  There is a good Scott in this one, though; Scott Mechlowicz plays the hopeless romantic pretty well, and I actually felt like cheering him on in some parts.  There are really no standout characters in Eurotrip (except maybe the creepy Italian tourist the group runs into in each city), and the whole thing just seems like a rehash.  Not that it's a completely bad thing; it is a funny movie, and if you liked Road Trip, you'll get a kick out of this one too.",1093219200,2,1976,4.715116279069767

1498239,3,B00005JN0A,"Teen films are in a realm of there very own, and this one just doesn't hold up compared to other teen comedies or just comedies in general. At about 85 minutes, Eurotrip moves along quickly using the typical tag lines for maximum laughs, though I didn't laugh much in throughout this film. The things the filmmakers obviously wanted to be funny just didn't work out, some of the crude jokes reminded me of those really bad teen TV shows that use laugh tracks to compensate for an actual audience not laughing at all.

The movie is about a recent high school graduate named Scott (his look and voice bear striking resemblance to Brad Pitt), whose girlfriend dumps him in the beginning because he's too predictable. At an after-grad party, he sees his girlfriend making out with the lead singer of a band played by Matt Damon, which is actually pretty funny especially since Damon has a spike in his chin and attempts to look hardcore. Scott has an internet penpal named Mike, and after a hard night drinking, Scott basically tells Mike to buzz off and never come to America. The next day Scott finds out that Mike is actually pronounced Mee-Ka, a popular German GIRLS name. So he decides he loves her and goes to Europe to apologize and profess his love.

The movie is so hair-brained I could hardly stand it. About twenty minutes in, I wanted it to be over. I did enjoy the appearance of Fred Armison (of Saturday Night Live) who plays a goofy, raunchy Italian guy. A couple things were funny, most were not. I'm sure kids still in high school would enjoy this film, but my advice is to instead check out other teen comedies like Sixteen Candles or American Pie or even Road Trip.",1092787200,,1680,4.559602649006623

The first two were as good as i thought they would be, but I was wrong about Eurotrip. Eurotrip has to be one of the best and funniest movies of the year.

The movie's about a kid fresh out of high school named Scotty who recently found out his g/f was cheating on him (the way he finds out who she was cheating on him with is one of the funniest parts of the movie). Scotty finds out that his penpal from Germany's name is pronounced Mika and not Mike (spelled Meike)and is an incredibly hot chick. Scotty decides to head off to Europe with 3 friends where they experience some really funny stuff on the way to getting Meike.

Over there they run in to English soccer hooligans (Vinnie Jones in good form), Italian bisexuals, and so on. The Europeans are stereotyped, but not in a too insulting way (I am European myself by the way). Some jokes are spot-on, like the Dutch bakery, the German truck driver, or the effects of absinthe. Other things are just stupid, like the portrayal of Bratislava.

2. Cheap sex flicks. (...) Heh! The dude's twin sister had got it going on throughout the whole movie.

The movie's premise:  that a wimper-snapper high school grad mistakenly thinks his German internet pen paler is a male and therefore decides that contact should be written off.  Well, turns out he was wrong: his pen pal is a gorgeous German blonde female.
The entire basis for the movie is attempting to rectify that error.  Apparently his pen paler decides to block him.  The primitive email screen tells him that his email is blocked and he cannot communicate with her further.  In real life, that calls for creating a new email address so that one can retain contact with the blocker.  In any case, in the movie, that calls for going to Europe.
Most of the European clips are quite lousy and sporadic.  There's not much of a point to being in Europe other than the German girl he seeks.  A high degree of anti-intellectualism pervades the movie.  I can understand the interest in sex, but it tends to be of the base sort rather than the romantic.  It does not seem plausible that a high school graduate can say ""I love you"" to a German girl he thought (until recently) was a male.  The only reason he came to love her was because he learned her name was female?  If the relationship between them was that superficial, it is hard to believe that his interest transcended looks much at all.

The four main characters are excellent, each living up to the stereotypes dictated by earlier forays into the teen sex comedy realm, but adding something new as well.  Supporting characters are generally pretty entertaining, especially the soccer hooligans (I always get that Business song stuck in my head when I think of that scene), Matt Damon's cameo as the lead singer in a pop punk band (easily the funniest part of the whole flick), and the regrettably cut scene with Joanna Lumley as the owner of a youth hostel.
The exclusion of Lumley's scene (you can see it during the credits, though, so it's not completely abandoned) is one of a few complaints I have with this movie.  I found the actress that played Mieke to be extremely boring and rigid, but she made good eye candy, which is really what they were going for in this movie.  Where the film fails the most, though, is that it starts off strong, then somewhere around the time that they end up in eastern Europe, it takes a turn for the worst, as the characters wake up out of their lives of reckless abandon and act more *gasp* mature.  Fortunately, there are enough laughs toward the end to make it completely worth your time to finish off the movie, and the beginning has some absolutely priceless moments.
The DVD package is great, too, with plenty of deleted scenes, some interesting commentary by the director and the writers, as well as the ""party along"" commentary where you basically get to listen to the writers get completely bombed while playing the Eurotrip drinking game.

During a family photo-opt Scotty gets dumped by his girlfriend all the while the family continues snapping pictures of their son's big day. Flash -forward to the senior party where Matt Damon struts his stuff as a punk rocker in the funniest cameo I've seen in years. The catchy ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" says it all. Like many teen movies there's the gratuitous nudity surprisingly and disturbingly there's a nudist beach scene featuring full frontals of middle-aged men.

You can't just see this movie only a 2 or 3 times, because you will ask for more. Any American Pie 1 or Road Trip fan should get this movie. If you don't like these kind of movie, well don't see it because you will find it boring as the the two others. Probably, most for people in 10s and 20s ! For olders one, they will find it stupid unless if they like that kind of movie. see ya ... ! (warning: if you see this movie one time, prepare yourself to cry because is so hilarious and be ready to watch it ten times in a short amount of time!!)

The jokes are stupid and the movie tries too hard to be just like Roadtrip.  This movie is not even close to being as funny as Roadtrip. Roadtrip is a classic and this movie is crap.",1087862400,7,295,4.051724137931035

Well, the movie started off by being totally amazing.  It slowly drifts in to a story about a German girl named Mieke and Scott a beautiful love story.  The movie ends up becoming a story about a robot, some drunken British people, some weird Spanish guy, naked men, insest, and last but not least Hitler.  Although the movie takes some crazy [caraaaazzzzyyyyyy]twists and turns it all turns out to be a terrefic movie with a great ending.  My original review gave this movie a negative 2 out of 10 but Hitler boosted it up to a 4.  So thank you Hitler.",1087689600,,565,4.446601941747573

1498497,2,B00005JN0A,"Oh yeah, that's right I did. It was called American Pie.
Rehashed comedy. Can't they think of something new to make us laugh, or an interesting idea. An average of 4 stars! You must be kidding me.
No originality at all.
No, they must go through the teen movie cliche check list:

Foreign girl loves American guy ( check)
Wild party attended with friend ( check )

1498538,4,B00005JN0A,"Well you won't confuse it with it's big brother Road Trip nor the recent classic Old School which took hilarious to epic levels, but Eurotrip has some funny moments which makes it a stand alone type of movie.  I loved the inital scene when Scotty gets dumped by his girlfriend cuz she can't stop cheating on him, only to attend the after graduation party where the band leader is actually singing about how he porked his ex-girlfriend without him knowing on stage in front on him, in front of everybody.  It gets no more humiliating than that.  And of course Cooper (Jacob Pitts) convincing his boss at a law firm that he's actually at work when they are enroute to Europe was hilarious.  And how can I forget my man Vinnie Jones (From Snatch Fame) playing the leader of soccer hooligans.  I love the way those Londoners talk, just hilarious.  Like I said before it's not nearly as over the top as Old School, Road Trip, the first two American Pies, How High, or even Paper Soldiers, but Eurotrip holds it own.",1086652800,3,1010,4.521978021978022

I just bought this DVD yesterday, and watched it, the laughs aren't very constant and alot of times, it is just stupid.  If you are going to get this, definetly buy the unrated one because some of the unrated scenes make it kinda worth the money.  It should've been better.",1086480000,3,359,4.3283582089552235
1498540,5,B00005JN0A,"Eurotrip is insanely funny. One of the best parts of the movie is the song ""Scotty Doesn't Know,"" sung by guest-star Matt Damon, which is in itself, reason to get this movie. But the story goes, that Scotty and Mieke, his German pen pal have been pen pals for a long time, and when Mieke hits on Scotty, he basically tells her off. By the time he realizes Mieke is a girl's name, and that she's insanely hot, she's blocked his account. So he decides to hop the next plane to London on his way to Berlin. What ensues is a wacky series of twists and turns. The movie was excellent, and not unconditionally crappy like other goofy teenage raunch flicks. Starring Michelle Trachtenburg (Buffy's Dawn) and newcomers Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Travis Wester, with cameos by Matt Damon, Kristen Kreuk, and Lucy Lawless.",1086393600,3,816,4.673611111111111

1498542,5,B00005JN0A,"i so loved this movie. it was so funny. i like when the guy had the thing around his chest with the passports and maps in it and when the mugger came at the wrong time when he was getting oral the mugger thought he was telling him that he loved him but he really was talking to the girl. and i like when they drunk so much the twins made out. i like when the guy went through all that stuff to get that t-shirt. i like when michelle tragenberg bent over in the movie and the guy thought it was another girl because u know they don't think of her as a girl. i also like when the men was on the beach and they had those little pennis' i was crakkin' up at thet theater, and when she about to get nude. THE REAL REASON I WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE IS BECAUSE MICHELLE PLAYS IN IT AND IM A BIG FAN OF HERS, AND IT ALSO LOOKED EXCITING. Thank u",1086220800,2,834,3.7988505747126435
1498543,5,B00005JN0A,"I saw this in the theater (one of few, sadly) and found it absolutely hilarious! I purchased the DVD today and well- it's still damn funny. Great music, fun cast, and very quotable. Even more the merrier if you've ever travelled in Europe as a youngster. They've also crammed a decent amount of extras onto the one disc as well.",1086220800,2,328,4.483333333333333
1498544,5,B00005JN0A,"Although I can't say that this movie had all that of original plot (its kind of like Road Trip mixed with National Lampoon's European Vacation) it was definately funny.  Four friends, Scott, Cooper and the twins Jenny and Jamie travel Europe bound for Berlin to find Scott's hot penpal Micah.  During their trek they run into a bunch of soccer hooligans, get groped by an Italian train passenger, experiment with a number of substances, and have some unholy affairs in the Vatican.
Overall, this movie makes the viewer laugh at the expense of European stereotypes.  If you are a fan of the American Pie movies or those of the party-sex movies (Animal House, Porky, Road Trip, etc.) then I would recommend giving this movie a glance.  If you liked Road Trip, I think that you will find Eurotrip even funnier.  Like most ""unrated"" DVDs that I have seen I can't saw that the unrated quality adds much to the movie.  In terms of female nudity, breasts are numerous (as is expected of these kinds of movies) but there is a little more male nudity than one might expect.  If you watch this movie, definately make sure to check out the extra features. Unlike most deleted scence, some of the deleted scenes in this movies are as funny as scenes that made the cut.",1086220800,6,1256,4.605381165919282
