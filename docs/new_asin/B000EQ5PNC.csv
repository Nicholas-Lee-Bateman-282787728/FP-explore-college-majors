2527183,5,B000EQ5PNC,"I'm not much of a country guy but my wife turned me on to this. Amazing performances by all. An absolute buy if you like country/bluegrass, musicianship and live performance. Stand outs: Ricky Scaggs at high speed, Alison Krauss with any one and Vince Gill with Ricky and Alison. Outstanding!!",1210809600,5,293,4.88
2527184,5,B000EQ5PNC,Loved the DVD.  Great quality and best of all was Charley Pride's performance.  Highly recommended.,1194307200,2,99,5.533333333333333
2527185,4,B000EQ5PNC,"Over here in The Netherlands nearly nobody knows people like Vince Gill and Martina McBride. What a bloody shame that is!
When Vince Gill is singing Go Rest High On that Mountain with Allison Krauss and Ricky Scaggs the world stops turning for me. I nearly can't imagine that there are people in the world who wouldn't love this song. I simply get tears in my eyes. Vince is for me by far the best country vocalist on this planet.
And how awesome are Martina McBrides' both songs. For me she's the huge queen of country female singers. With power and passion she sings, just awesome. What a pity she doesn't sing a duet with Vince, a missed chance!
It's a pity that there are some singers who shouldn't perform on this dvd, but what the heck, YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BUY IT!!",1194048000,12,770,4.391608391608392
2527186,5,B000EQ5PNC,"For the third time in history instead of going to Nashville to visit the
Grand Ole Opry, the GOP goes to New York to interprete their genuine
Country music. The first time it happened back in 1947, the second time
in 1961 and on the third occasion, the event took place on Nov. 14th 2005.
Led by country star Vince Gill, this musical reunion is just fantastic
with today's and yesterday's wonderful country artists ranging from
86 year old Little Jimmy Dickens to the nowadays top singers like
Brad Paisley, Alan Jackson, Trace Adkins, Martina McBride, Alison
Krauss etc and Vince Gill himself. The sound quality is superb which
shouldn't surprise us because the live concert is held at the world
famous Carnegie Hall. That's why all of the artists give their best
possible interpretation because they feel so ""honoured"" to act at this
music hall. If you like Country music, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST! and
if you like all kinds of music it's a must as well because it's not
just Country: it ranges from classic to rock and the various back up
groups also act at an enormous high musical level. Don't let this
musical occasion pass you by!",1189296000,20,1137,4.633663366336633

2527189,5,B000EQ5PNC,"This DVD features the show held in Nov.,2005. Many major talents are represented here, like veterans Jimmy Dickens and Bill Anderson to newer stars like Brad Paisley and Trace Adkins. Great songs such as Ricky Scaggs' ""Black Eyed Suzie"" and Trisha Yearwood on ""She's In Love With The Boy"" and many other popular favorites from such artists as Vince Gill, Charley Pride, Martina McBride and Alan Jackson. The shining gem of the evening though, is Alison Krauss & Union Station's performance of the Patsy Cline tune ""She's Got You"". Alison's crystal clear voice will give you chills.

 This show was well produced and recorded, it's a keeper!",1148342400,34,640,4.97196261682243
2527200,5,B000EQ5PNC,Loving the Grand Old Opry as I do and being able to see it on the greatest stage in USA was an enjoyable experience. Thank you for offering this amazing DVD and allowing me to be a part of American Heritage. The performances were outstanding and I truly enjoyed the DVD.,1369094400,,270,4.313725490196078

2527202,5,B000EQ5PNC,"Browsing for some musical/concerts and stumbled across this gem.
Not a country music fan but I like bluegrass and saw Alison Krause as part of the lineup.
I decided to give it a try based on the stellar reviews and I'm not disappointed. It's a must-own.
Just wish the concert was longer!!",1363824000,,288,4.5576923076923075

2527204,5,B000EQ5PNC,"Wow. As a musician, I was blown away by the passion of the performances. Vince Gill, Trisha Yearwood, Alan Jackson, Brad Paisley, Ricky Scaggs--every one was at the very top of their game this magical night. Listening to Alison Krause and Martina McBride literally gave me goosebumps. Obviously being at the legendary Carnegie Hall provided extra motivation to all of the assembled musicians. Also noteworthy were song choices that honored past country legends like Tammy Wynette and Patsy Cline. Even the less impressive appearances by Little Jimmy Dickens and Charley Pride provided some historical context for the evening. Truly a fantastic DVD.",1357516800,,648,5.362745098039215

2527207,5,B000EQ5PNC,"Loved this DVD, so good to see real country people outside of ""thier box"" of Nashville. Carneige Hall must have felt very special that night. She must have felt very honored to have hosted this special group of people.",1323129600,,218,4.615384615384615

8112644,5,B000EQ5PNC,"I have owned this DVD for a couple of years. It is as good as gold to me as I can find nothing at all to complain about. With an all star cast being hosted by Vince Gill & performances by Alison Krauss, Marina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, Alan Jackson, Brad Praisley, Charlie Pride, Jimmy Dickens, Trace Adkins, Ricky Scaggs, & Vince Gill  . The sound of the all the female singers is captivating as they will blow up away. Also pay attention to the other musicians who add there personal touches to make each & every song, an outstanding performance. OK to watch on big screen (except when Alison, Marina, or Trisha come out, you will fall in love over & over again with the sights & sounds) & crank up surround sound for a totally awesome experience. This is one for the time capsule, as I am sure many viewers of this DVD have cherished every moment of it as much as I have. If I caught someone stealing this DVD from me, it would be a fight to the death. I would not let it go.",1458000000,,978,4.202127659574468
