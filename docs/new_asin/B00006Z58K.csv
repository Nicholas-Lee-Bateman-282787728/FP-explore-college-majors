After the 3 or so different ESPN and parking lot video clips are viewed.  Sensei Reeves then goes on to show how to punch the makiwara.  With little to no hip motion used to punch the makiwara, Sensei Reeves goes on to show (little to no hip motion) basic self-defense application.

With 20 years of karate experience (JKA/Shotokan) I saw very little in this video that I could recommend, TO ANYONE!

FYI to George Alexander:  When you go to an interview. You need a suit. Not some ugly button down summer flower shirt.",1136592000,2,689,4.569105691056911

If you keep up with this guy and his workout routine, I don't think there is much you couldn't break (within human capabilities).",1091750400,,285,4.72
