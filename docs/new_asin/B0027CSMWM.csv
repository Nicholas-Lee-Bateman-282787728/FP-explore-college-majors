3864562,4,B0027CSMWM,"Enjoyed the series greatly.  Wife & I watched it together over a few weeks/months. It is awesome to be able to watch the series in such a way without having to wait weeks for the TV show to develop.  Did not give 5 Stars as the 24 Season 6/7 Redemption DVD was not included.  Somehow, should have known it was not included, but having series 1-7 not include the movie in between series 6 & 7 keeps it from having 5 stars.",1251504000,15,421,4.109756097560975
3864563,5,B0027CSMWM,"When 24 first came out, it was very fresh and original.  24 hours is one man's life.  Interesting.  Couple it with real world possibilities with the situations we are truly facing; Addicting!  The liberals have a hard time with it because Jack bypasses so-called civil liberties.  As bad as that may seem, it is sometimes necessary.  I don't like government getting into my life any more than anyone else, but this show opened up dialogue into what is or isn't necessary to win a war on terror.  How far will someone go or what may someone do to protect an American?  After 23 years in the US Army, I would say many of us would do what it takes, regardless...........

Jack took everything to the extreme to protect his country and countrymen.  From the very first episode, I was hooked.  Yeah, there is the lame Hollywood crap that detracts from some episodes, but for the most part, it is heart-pumping, adrenaline racing, non-stop action.  I have seen every episode, but after all this time, I wanted to go back to the beginning.  So, I bought every episode.  Glad I did.",1246406400,4,1074,4.58421052631579
3864564,5,B0027CSMWM,"From the very first season until last episode of the seventh, 24 will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I personally, can not get enough.  For anybody who hasn't seen it, you won't stop until you watched it all and you'll want more.  And while you have to wait, you want to watch these seasons over and over again.  Jack Bauer is a true american hero. 24 should will go down as one of the all time greatest shows.  I can't wait for season 8.  You can pretty much find a synopsis about the show anywhere but if you're reading this, I'm sure you'll buy the show.  Ask yourself,""What would Jack do?""",1244332800,10,598,4.192982456140351
3864565,5,B0027CSMWM,Absolutely Love 24!!! Season 7 just ended and I need MORE.  Item is on backorder but can't wait to buy the set for my Mom's birthday!! She wants the full set to get thru the summer.  Season 7 was not the best but the series is great to rewatch to watch the character development and Jack is always fun to look at as is Tony!!! can't wait to get a set for myself too...Enjoy--worth the buy.,1242777600,4,389,4.105263157894737

3864617,5,B0027CSMWM,"I have been looking for this complete series at a affordable price for a very long time, years... I finally found this jewel at a local store for $49.99!! I will tell you this is an awesome series! This series was on Netflix and once Netflix took the show  off. I knew I had to have the series to own! This series is filled with action and will not disappoint you!

If you are looking for action, look no further... The only difference that I noticed between this complete set and the brown box set with 24: Live Another Day, is the fact that it has the disc set for 24: Live Another Day, and the first season has 7 disc in this set and 6 disc in the brown box set with Live Another Day. I simply just purchased 24: Live Another Day separate to have everything 24 has to offer.

Now I can watch this as many times as I want and when I want.  If you don't have this  in your collection, you are missing out.
Great addition to your collection!!",1458518400,,942,4.0978260869565215

I was looking for each of the shows individually, and couldn't find some of the shows (especially at the Marts). This is so exciting. I love this show, mainly because of its' famed writers Mr. Surnow, Rocco Mateo, Robert Cochran,
just to name a few. These are the same gifted action writers who brought La Femme Nikita to the small screen, I'll love that show forever!

3864736,5,B0027CSMWM,"Fast paced, intense & exciting to watch.  This is an addictive, complete series!  (Only the movie that came later--Live Another Day is not included.)
One season will take you 18 hours to finish!
Good for most adults... I bought it for my son, but even I can't stop watching.  I am not usually a fan of action shows especially any that depict physical violence, but this show is an exception.  It is not quite as violent as 007's Casino Royale but is not necessarily for the squeamish (unless you, like I, don't mind looking away now and again).
Almost constant action... unique show because it is in ""real time"" and you see the clock ticking throughout as the story progresses.  Not totally believable, but that doesn't diminish the fun.  Like the movie Eagle Eye, you just have to sit down and enjoy the ride!!!
Worth owning!!!",1424649600,,828,4.636986301369863
3864737,5,B0027CSMWM,"I purchased this from Amazon and was extremely happy with everything! Kiefer Sutherland who is the star in 24: The Complete Series, was amazing, the story plot was fast paced and exceptionally well orchestrated in every way.

3864934,1,B0027CSMWM,It sucked - I wanted to get the series through Amazon because I thought it was the best quality but how do you know that when there is nothing on the DVDs when they arrive.  And there wasn't. They were just blank. And this happened 3 times. After the second time I was assured that the problem had been fixed. Well it wasn't and the third time was a charm when nothing was on the DVDs then as well. I think somebody needs some tuning in here. Maybe fired. Did anybody else have this happen to them. I don't understand how this got past the product control 3 times. And they knew about it after the second time. But still the problem persisted. So I won't be buying anymore 24 series from Amazon any time soon. If they wanted to send me one free of charge with the assurances that the damn thing worked then I'd accept it. But don't think that I would be going to the trouble of sending it back again. No I won't do that. I'll just chuck it. But I'd challenge Amazon to do that for me  because my loyalty is all used up now.,1408060800,3,1023,4.11

It's unclear how the cases could endure such damage while being enclosed in the box set as well as packaging for shipping, and they're all damaged the exact same way in the opening spine. A shame there's no easy way to contact the seller and there's no allowance for such delays in using. Guess I have to not purchase online for things if I can't get to viewing them immediately in the future. Big disappointment...not the show, but the box set with dvd cases damaged and dvd's basically floating around inside. Check carefully if you but...immediately!",1401753600,,1052,4.6310160427807485

3865084,5,B0027CSMWM,"I have not completed watching the entire series, but what I have watched is as exciting and thrilling as I remember it to be.  The problem is I have trouble not continuing on to the next episode.  When it was on TV I had to wait a week until the next episode, now I don't have to.  Without commercials, each episode is about 43 minutes long so it seems like one more won't hurt, and then one more and one more.",1401667200,,410,4.037037037037037

8354514,1,B0027CSMWM,"The show itself was very good.  I want to review the DVDs themselves.  We've had the DVD set for a couple of years and finally got around to watching them.  We're only into Season Three and I hate the DVDs themselves.  Unlike other series, like West Wing, we can't ""Play All"".  We have to constantly go back to the Main Menu, select a time (episode), hopefully remember the time (episode) we watched last night to continue watching the series. Once we've picked the time we want to watch we have choose it and then it goes to a secondary menu to push play.  We could Play All for the first season but so far Season Two and Three have to be individually chosen.  When we turn the DVD player off, we have to start again with the main menu and try and remember what episode we're up to.  I hope the other Seasons are better.  For this reason alone, I would not recommend buying these DVDs.",1525046400,,886,4.289156626506024

8354520,5,B0027CSMWM,"I use these movies in a pretty non-standard way.  I first watched these on Netflix when I started working late nights, and I was looking for a movie to watch that was suspenseful enough to keep me awake, but boring/predictable enough to not distract me from my work.

""24"" fits the bill perfectly.  Many seasons involve Jack violating the rules (and/or convincing someone else to do so (as long as he says, ""please"", he gets whatever he wants), and then he saves the day, and then sort of gets in trouble, but mostly is forgiven.  There are some adjustments to that throughout all of the years, but not much.

Netflix has removed these from their streaming movies, and I've waited quite a while, and finally decided to bite the bullet and buy them.  And now I'm on my third time watching the show, and since I'm only watching it with half an eye, it is mostly still as suspenseful as the first time...  :)

Of course, now I can't see Kiefer Sutherland in any other show (like Touch) without thinking of his role in ""24""...

I do feel bad for the people who watched this on TV - they had to wait a week between each hour of the show - I usually watch 3 or 4 in a sitting.",1493251200,,1170,4.281818181818182
