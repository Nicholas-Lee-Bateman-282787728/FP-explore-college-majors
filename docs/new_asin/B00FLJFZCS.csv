8616708,5,B00FLJFZCS,"Satoshi Kon's best film. A beautiful story with Kon's masterful editing. Such a fun watch. Video quality is terrific, it looks to have been remastered. Video quality is much better than the 'Perfect Blue' Japan import. The film's score is delivered through great audio quality. There are no english subtitles which is a bummer, but I knew that before purchase. It plays on my Xbox One and blu ray player. A must have for any Satoshi Kon fan!",1483833600,,441,4.666666666666667
