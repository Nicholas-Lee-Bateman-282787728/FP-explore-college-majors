7924698,5,B00004VYHW,"This is one of the few films about
the Indochina War I admire along with
Schloendorfer's other masterpiece about
the forlorn retreat of a far flung
French Laotion platoon near Dien
Bien Phu during the NVA offensive
into Laos in 1954 -- the director
was a veteran of the campaign and
both films are realistic down to
the smallest details -- The 374th Platoon
is also great and the same actor played
the main subject in both films --

""La Crabe Tambour"" is about this particular
young officer (and those affected by
having met him) for whom Indochina was a
life changing experience -- Like many
veterans he ends as a recluse captain
of a commercial fisning boat on the
Great Banks -- A great and utterly
memorable film I've failed to find
in the US at an affordable price!",1374710400,2,770,4.5
7924699,5,B00004VYHW,"This is, simply, one of the best films ever made.  It's got everything.  Great acting, thoughtful storytelling, and breathtaking cinematography.  It is a movie that takes its time, and wants us to think as we watch.  The resulting experience is what great cinema is all about.  Viewed without preconceptions, it is a film that captures our imagination and transports us into a world of honor, loyalty, and friendship -- high sounding virtues that are not without price.  It is a difficult film to forget, but then who would want to forget it?  I truly feel that I am in some small way a better, more complete human being for having seen this.  It's that good.

If you are going to watch Le Crabe Tambour, I recommend doing a little reading about the historical background: the French experience in Indochina and Algeria.  Even a passing acquaintance with these events will help.

It is incomprehensible to me that this wonderful film is not commercially available in the United States.  Who makes these decisions?  It's just sad.",1296345600,4,1029,4.844827586206897
7924700,1,B00004VYHW,"This film made me realize there are many things I am not good at.
First, a mariner's life. Second, small towns & closed societies. Third,
military life. Fourth, French films with too little dialogue :)?

I was truly disappointed with this one. I understand there are ""big
philosophical issues"" here, but sincerely, the only one I truly
understood whas the talent's parable (which we know since early
childhood) and a mild idea of the ""Heart of darkness"", rightly induced
by the mention of another of Conrad's novels, being read by the Captain.

Yes, the images are fantastic. The sea that almost got frozen seemed
unbelievable, and some close up takes of the ship made it even
beautiful. But the ""antropological"" slant of the ship's life, machines,
fishermen, sailor's ""humour"", ""stories"" and appeals to authority finally
got on my nerves. Let alone Lt. Willsdorff! I suppose the mention of a
military officer arrying a cat ALL the time would make any true one sneer.
'Le Crabe-Tambour' was totally lost in his own world. He showed his
leadership with the Africans, when he made them win a battle. When was later made ""general"" he seemed, for the first time, to enjoy himself,
not studying them like, say, an ethnographer.

But it wasn't enough.

""The meaning of silences""... Good for putting yourself to sleep.",1236902400,,1311,4.918552036199095
7924701,5,B00004VYHW,"A little-known cinematic masterpiece of sweeping scope, ""Le Crabe Tambour"" is a film for people who like a good story and who like to think.  It's a wonderful film, a film with real and interesting characters and a film with a real, honest-to-god story.  These are rare qualities in movies days and, very unfortunately, there is no way that Hollywood would make a movie like this today.  I first saw ""Le Crab Tambour"" at a Filmex (now defunct Los Angeles film festival) in the 80s and was haunted by it for years.  When this VHS version became availavble I was serving in an overseas post (in Eastern Europe) and had to wait several weeks for the video to arrive.  I watched the tape in awe.  The story development is quite sophisticated and there are many references to Joseph Conrad.  If you are a Conrad fan you will find this film to your liking.  But it is also linked to Schoendorfer's superb Indochina War film ""The 317th Platoon"" also available from Amazon.  (Buy it if you don't have it.)  ""Le Crab Tambour"" moves beyond the Indochina theater to the ""Savage War of Peace"" in Algeria and beyond.  It helps if you are somewhat familiar with the history of what happened in France's colonies after World War II but this is in no way a documentary.  This is a poetic and beautiful story that (at least in my case) captivates and transports you into several wildly different worlds.  The central image -- the most amazing and completely Gallic image -- is that of the French naval rating playing a bugle as a little French riverine craft chugs down a Vietnam river.  Absurd, tragic, doomed, yet astoundingly beautiful.  Our central character (again, related to the ""317th"") travels on a junk from Indochina to a series of adventures from Somalia to Algeria to Paris to the North Atlantic.  Even if you are not particularly fond of the French you will enjoy this film.  Should you be a combat veteran of Vietnam or post Vietnam conflicts you will have a special appreciation of the characters.
Only caveat is this is a subtitled film (French track but the subtitles are crisp and easy to read).  On the other hand, if you like Joseph Conrad you have to buy this tape.  Just buy it.",1013644800,19,2184,4.596899224806202
7924702,4,B00004VYHW,"Le Crabe Tambour is a moody piece that explores the conflicts inherent in following one's own sense of honor. The backdrop of French colonial involvement in Indochina provides a tableau that will resonate for Americans who experenced their own personal conflicts during America's involvement in Vietnam. However, Le Crabe Tambour is much more than a (French) Vietnam period piece. It follows the conscience of the protagonist through his own inward reflections and overt actions during French involvement in Indochina, and later, in Algeria. Historically compelling, and full of sub-plots and rich character development: this is a fine film that requires time to ponder. As such, it is not for everyone, and won't qualify as ""entertainment"" for many. However, it is a deeply rewarding journey into the complex world of personal and national honor, in a French context. Le Crabe Tambour is also a film which draws upon jungle, desert, and maritime landscapes to provide symbolic illustration to the riveting story unfolding. I enjoyed viewing this film the first time I saw it; and every time I watch it I find more to think about.",924220800,16,1130,5.146739130434782
