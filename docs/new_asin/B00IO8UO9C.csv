6283715,5,B00IO8UO9C,Both of these movies are a great watch. Mr. Roberts shows a side of the military that is all to true but rarely seen or acknowledge. It truly is a trip from boredom to tedious. No time for sergeant is another side of the military though rare I have seen it.,1481068800,,257,4.0588235294117645

6283752,5,B00IO8UO9C,"I bought this primarily because of ""Mister Roberts"".  You can't ask for a better cast - Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, James Cagney.  A superb classic from beginning to end.  I was also very pleasantly surprised by ""No time for Sergeants"".  Not the greatest supporting cast, but Andy Griffith is hilarious.",1433289600,,301,4.96

6283758,5,B00IO8UO9C,"I remember thinking about MISTER ROBERTS on the day I heard of Jack Lemmon's passing. I believe it was on June 28, 2001 or thereabouts. I remember thinking how The U.S.S. Reluctant along with Jack Lemmon had set sail on her final voyage. The U.S.S. Hewell was the actual 250-ton cargo ship at the naval base at Midway, which doubled for the U.S.S. Reluctant used to film MISTER ROBERTS. Henry Fonda was Lieutenant (jg) Doug Roberts or just known as beloved Mister Roberts to his crew. Mister Roberts was a man of dignity and honor who just wanted to do his part in the war. Instead Mister Roberts is rendered impotent on the U.S.S. Reluctant commanded by a hot-tempered, eccentric basically uneducated Captain brilliantly played by James Cagney. The script under the tenure of director John Ford mixed his usual comic military camaraderie with the despair of the sailors stuck in remote out of action sea-lanes and ports during World War II in the South Pacific. In effect the Captain represents the enemy to the crew and the dregs of the naval officer corps to Mister Roberts. The ever stoic Roberts finds solace in the crew (Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, Perry Lopez, Tige Andrews and many others), a fatherly William Powell as Doc and Jack Lemmon as Ensign Pulver. Jack Lemmon won an Oscar for his role as the knee-jerk compulsive and glib wheeler-dealer Ensign Pulver. The Captain shows no compassion for the crew and it seems that his only real feelings are for a palm tree he keeps on deck. As events unfold and personalities clash into a final confrontation and the realities of war hit home it is the unlikely Ensign Pulver who does a 180-degree turn at the film's closing shot. Henry Fonda, William Powell, Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Ken Curtis and even the Captain James Cagney among many other members of the crew of the U.S.S. Reluctant have now left us. On June 28, 2001 I read of Jack Lemmon. I suppose the `Order of the Palm Leaf' has now been passed from the hand of its final owner and now rests below the calm blue waters of the South Pacific. As the U.S.S. Reluctant turns its final bend into the sunset we say, ""Goodnight Mister Roberts, Goodnight Ensign Pulver. Godspeed.""

I have not watched NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS in many years. Andy Griffith's performance as country bumpkin Will Stockdale who is drafted, so it would seem, and ends up in the Air Force is truly funny service comedy. Andy Griffith seems to drive people nuts unintentionally or perhaps not. That is what is at the heart of the matter. This is a film you just have to see because there are many twists and turns to Andy Griffith's character and performance. The cast of this film always amazed me and it includes Nick Adams, Don Knotts, Dub Taylor, Murray Hamilton, Will Hutchins, James Millhollin, Jamie Farr and Jean Willes. NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS is an Endearing film.",1414022400,5,2876,4.67258382642998

8643925,5,B00IO8UO9C,"These are wonderful vintage movies and the transfer from film to DVD looks very clear.  Early CinemaScope pictures sometimes had slight lens imperfections, but this occurred when the pictures were filmed, and have nothing to do with the transfer.  Overall they look good and are enjoyable.
