4602110,5,B0058YPG1G,"Walter White, his family, and associates have yet to reach bottom in their respective stories.  An amazing combination of lives and the directions they are taking.  Each episode flies by.  The writing is dead on for riveting pace and amazing story telling.  Cannot recommend this show enough.  Quickly becoming the best show on television.  Thanks AMC.",1311552000,2,352,5.196428571428571
4602111,4,B0058YPG1G,"Great Show, but the flashbacks of story holes is getting a little bit too much, this smells like prolonging the series to sell product to me a la LOST. Something's got to give here, a major character needs to go or it risks going on and on with the impossible/improbable savior scenarios. Tighten this up writers.",1311552000,3,313,4.607142857142857
4602112,5,B0058YPG1G,"According to the series' promos, this will be the year Walt becomes the real force.  I don't doubt that.

However, this amazing episode leads us into Season 4 seamlessly, and yet plays with every expectation we had from the adrenaline explosion that ended Season 3.  When the story stitches back together, with our pulses racing, we are treated to wonderful performances by the entire cast...yet again.  This episode takes Giancarlo Esposito (Gus) to an entirely new level of malevolence and shows us even more of who he really is.

I don't want to spoil the plot if you haven't seen it, but the key scene which sets up the rest of the season is so intense and explosive, that I, a person known for her calmness and ability not to show emotion, nearly jumped through the ceiling.  This one scene deserves an Emmy for a special category.

I can hardly wait until Episode Two.  I watched this one three times, with the last viewing an hour ago to prepare me for tonight's presentation.

There are two great dark dramadies on the air, Dexter and Breaking Bad.  Breaking Bad holds the edge, partly because every part of it is one degree of separation from the life of almost any one of us.  Every step of these people's dark paths is only one tragic circumstance away from any of our lives.

Episode 1 tells me we will not be disappointed.  All I can say is that I will hope Walt's lung cancer stays in remission for many seasons to come.  Brilliant, thought-provoking, seamless production makes these people real.

Lesson for Episode 1:  Don't make even the smallest mistake when you're dealing with Gus Frin!  Going back to the key scene: Watch each person closely!  Then rewind, go back and really watch, one-by-one, especially Mike!  I wish there were a higher word of praise than ""masterpiece.""  This series is unique!",1311465600,11,1819,4.678233438485805
4602113,5,B0058YPG1G,Breaking Bad is one of the best shows on t.v. mainly because of the story line and playwright. I highly recommend checking out this show.,1311379200,17,137,4.52
4602114,5,B0058YPG1G,Wow! I don't know why I did not see this one coming! As our boys slip deeper into the abyss - The writing and editing and acting continue at an excellent level. This opening episode has me already hoping for continued seasons.,1311379200,9,226,4.404761904761905
4602115,5,B0058YPG1G,"Incredible.
I wasn't sure whether the first episode of Season 4 would be able to live up to what Season 3 ended with.. But to my absolute pleasant surprise, it did. It went above and beyond every expectation I had for the show.

You'll be amazed by the characters once more and I cannot wait till Sunday for the next episode.",1311292800,8,325,4.327868852459017
4602116,5,B0058YPG1G,"Boy, this show sure deserves all the awards which has been heaped upon it.  Without dropping a beat, the show picks up where it leaves off and we get to see what Gus is going to do with Walter and Jesse.  Gus is his usually creepy self, solely focused on the prize of raking in the most money by selling meth.  Fascinating as this all is though, there are two other components we revisit which tug at our heart strings instead of our crime salivating nature.

The first is Walter's wife who can't find him and is worried that something terrible has happened.  The scene she puts on with the locksmith with her baby to get him to break into Walt's house is absolutely a gem.  It is a scene which can stand on its own without reference to everything else.

The second is former DEA agent Hank, Walter's brother-in-law.  He is in bed at home, bidding on items on ebay and doing nothing else.  He is making very slow progress on improving his mobility from his bullet wounds but a big part of that is his attitude.  He is the worst person to be handicapped in the world as he absolutely has no coping skills. Hank is easily now the most pathetic character on the show, something he himself seems to realize but has no interest in changing.

Just a fabulous episode in a fabulous series.",1311033600,18,1282,4.367088607594937

4602151,5,B0058YPG1G,For me it is between three and four for best season. This one was exciting from beg to end. And it has one of my fav episodes. Walt who has already turned from nerdy teacher into big time meth cook now seems to be goin mad as hes searching for money hidden under his floor and laughing like a mad man when he cant find it all. He needs the money to get away from some very bad men who want him dead but his wife has given it to a friend. Now he cant just take his money and hide and the finale is the showdown between gus and walt. It is so good. I highly recomend this show and this season.,1509148800,,591,3.813008130081301

4602168,5,B0058YPG1G,"""Breaking Bad"" has been a tremendous series throughout. This particular season plays out the war between Walt and Gus, with Jesse feeling trapped by his past actions in Walt's service and Skylar having to come to terms with what her life has become.",1503705600,,249,4.813953488372093
4602169,3,B0058YPG1G,"I'm in a small minority here in believing Season 4 of BB should never have happened. In my humble opinion the show totally jumped the shark in the ""Fly"", the 10th episode of Season 3. Season 4 fumbled around in search of a plot, and spent way too much time on the increasingly annoying Skyler and her stupid carwash, Hank and his boring minerals (which never do wind up figuring in to the plot in any meaningful way), the flashbacks with Gus.

The main problem here is that the people who made the show great didn't understand what made it great. They lost the thread of a mild mannered science teacher treading unfamiliar and dangerous waters. All the humor had evaporated by this time too. Once Walt became the one who knocks, BB was just another show about a low level gangster trying to survive and get ahead. We've seen that 1000 times before.",1502496000,,848,4.5064935064935066

4602303,4,B0058YPG1G,"This series continues to remain impressive. I thought at one point that the ""Fly"" episode might have been a shark-jump (as it's definitely the low-point of the series) but I continue to stay amazed by the writing and the characters of this series, and how long it manages to stay so believable. I will admit that the fate of Gus was both amusing and a tad ridiculous as (spoiler) we're to believe he's impacted by an explosion, gets up again and calmly walks out the door with half of his face gone then finally falls over dead? Seriously?  Seems like Vince Gilligan is veering unnecessarily into X-files territory with that. But it's forgivable, as so many of these episodes are just unbelievable (the ""crawlspace"" one just stays with your memory.)

One thing I can't quite get though is how Skyler White's passive-aggressive cloud of anger can last as long as it has. Walt has apologized and all but tried to make things right with her, and yet it appears she's constantly seething at the guy. It's heavy enough that it starts to get distracting. Regardless, the fourth season of Breaking Bad remains impressive.",1483574400,,1114,4.766839378238342

The entire crew has created a real compelling set of episodes. Once again B. Cranston is pretty good as a director..,1463875200,,442,4.402439024390244

4602880,3,B0058YPG1G,"As a dramatic television series goes this isn't bad but then again it isn't great. I think for the most part fans tune in for four main characters: Walter White, Jessie Pinkman, Hank Schrader the DEA agent and Gustavo the drug lord. The other characters are all background. By the end of season four Gustavo the drug lord has been killed as well as the Mexican cartel drug dealers. I just think there is no real way that the Schrader character could be dim witted as to not want to question his own brother in law. At the end of season four after the bomb explosion at the senior care center Walter White phones his wife who is being protected at Hank Schrader's house by numerous DEA agents. Walt phones the wife to say ""I won"". Supposedly no on missed Walt, not even the Car Wash? And the pipe bomb on the wheel chair was very visibly attached. It was very easy to see. Are they telling us that the black character who stayed with the old wheel chair bound gangster couldn't see the pipe bomb? He waited with the old man and walked all around the room. And at Jessie's house, the house became a drug den for degenerates for days on end. You mean, nobody called the cops? You're telling us the police didn't raid a house in a nice neighborhood which had become an open drug den? And then there's the fabrication that Walter White is a guy with a gambling addiction. Most people would celebrate a guy who has won a million or more dollars gambling. So Walter makes the family rich but is supposed to be ashamed of having made his money in such a fashion? And the Save Walter White website, we are supposed to believe that people cared enough to send him 160,000 or more to pay for his medical bills? And nobody is suspicious when the Whites laid down 800 THOUSAND dollars for a car wash? You don't win that kind of money in a card game or at a casino in just a matter of days. Maybe if Walt was a master gambler who worked full time at his craft, maybe then it was possible. But even gamblers stay on top of their losses. Walt would have been found out but we are to believe that Walter is a mastermind, a  Gold Finger sort of James Bond type nemesis. And so the fire at the lab destroyed all of the fingerprints that Jessie and Walter left over the period of months? And we are to believe that not one person on the staff at the laundry had the morality to report a meth lab that they all knew about? I don't know, maybe in Mexico where they commonly behead snitches, where the police are bought and paid for with drug money, maybe there they could keep all the employees quiet, but this drug lab was in the United States. So, Jessie and Walter just wiping down the laundry machine and such covered their tracks? And since Jessie Pinkman was known to have been in possession of the blue meth why would the cops not have raided his drug addled week long party? And the guy who owned the laundry for over thirty years would give it up without calling the city? So ONE GUY, the Bill Burr character told him he had violated some chemical disposal laws, so we are to believe the man wouldn't have looked into his situation further, that he too might not have gotten some legal advice? And when the RV was crushed, the police or the FBI still would have looked at the crushed vehicle for evidence that it had been a rolling drug lab and the garage owners would have been questioned perhaps detained for destruction of evidence. I'm no cop but these are just a few observations that I have made about the television show. Still, it was decent entertainment. The writing isn't bad but the show does strain your ability to believe it at times. I mean, the Mexican brother who had lost his legs freaked out when he saw Walter White and no one noticed this? And there was the sketch of Heisenberg with the goatee, hat and glasses. Hank Schrader had seen that sketch and Walt often wore that outfit in public, albeit without the sunglasses. It's like Clark Kent looking just like superman but with the glasses on and without the costume nobody sees the resemblance. But thank you Breaking Bad writers and producers for giving me something to look at over the holidays. I bought all six seasons. I had seen up through season three and more on cable and then we cancelled the cable. I was glad to catch up on the rest of the drama. And really, what is up with not having English subtitles. I frequently watch the English subtitles just so I can catch all of the dialogue. I could have gotten the blue ray set for $100 when it was on sale at a store but blue rays are such a pain in the ass to load and reload then there would not been any subtitles there either.",1451260800,,4649,4.3192219679633865

Little did I know that we would become just as addicted to this show as ""Walt's"" customers became addicted to his meth!  If you aren't ""hooked"" by the end of Season 1, maybe you should be watching baseball or golf, LOL.  We bought Seasons 1, 2, and 3 before buying the rest, just to see if we would like the series.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd buy the complete series up front and save a few bucks.  It's like a book that you just can't put down.  We liked it better than Mad Men.

4603563,5,B0058YPG1G,"The surprises, twists, danger, and depths of emotion don't let up at all this season, but continue through to the amazing finale.  The writers masterfully draw the noose tighter around these characters and mercilessly put them through the grinder.  Not even viewers are immune as our perceptions are manipulated and even challenged.

I have always felt sympathy for Walt and forgiven his failings, but this season, that support wavered when his behavior became unreasonable and needlessly antagonistic.  Some of his misery he brings on himself.  Yet, I still applauded his capacity for extricating himself from tight situations through ingenuity, luck, and sheer desperation.

I like Jesse, so it was hard to see him hit rock bottom after Gale, but it also meant that his recovery was all the more satisfying.  He proves to himself, other characters, and viewers that he can succeed, that he will not always be the screw-up.  The respect that he earns and now feels toward himself offers hope of a happier and more meaningful life, if only the writers allow it.

As for Skyler, I still don't like her, but at times this season, she showed a softer side by asking for Walts input and treating him like an equal rather than an inferior.  I even cheered for her (!) when she cleverly manipulated a problematic situation to her, and indirectly, Walts, advantage.  She showed that she can be a shrewd and determined accomplice.  Those moments made me wonder if I needed to rethink my opinion of Skyler, but alas, they were outweighed by scenes when she issues commands, dictates terms, and acts hypocritically.  She insists that she knows best. Its this inability to trust anyone elses judgment and the need to be in charge that galls me so much.

As if Walt and Gus don't have enough to contend with, Hanks renewed hunt for Heisenberg only adds to their headaches, but provides some exquisite tension for viewers as we wonder how much Hank will figure out and how much longer Walt can evade him.

What we learn of Gus background casts a fresh perspective on everything that has happened.

The show raises some intriguing questions:  Walt is rich, but how can he spend it when its all in cash?  Where would each character be if Walt hadnt been diagnosed with cancer and gotten involved with meth?  And Jesse himself brings up a thought-provoking point at a 12 step meeting:  if self-judgment and reproach trap addicts into a rut of drug use, isn't the self-acceptance the meetings encourage also a trap because people don't then face who they really are and the things they have done?

Bring on Season 5!",1424908800,,2599,4.808558558558558

Walter figures that once Gus, the head of the drug cartel, has made enough money off the drugs he produces that he will have him killed. Let the hunt begin! Walter must ask himself one question though. Who is the hunter and who is the game? Is he the cat or the mouse? This culminates into a shocking season finale that left people speechless worldwide!

4603692,5,B0058YPG1G,"Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are continuing to work as meth-cooks for ruthless criminal Gus Fring, but they are now at loggerheads. As both sides try to find a way to get on top so they no longer need the other and can eliminate them, Walter also continues to draw his ex-wife Skyler deeper into his schemes.

The fourth season of Breaking Bad is arguably the one where it goes from being consistently excellent to staking a claim to the ""Best Show on TV"" title. Up until now the show has painted Walter White in - at least somewhat - sympathetic terms. White wants what is best for his family and has made occasionally ruthless decisions to back that up in self-defence, or when the alternative is the death of his family or Jesse. White has certainly been on moral slide (especially given his inaction in the Season 2 finale that led to a death) but he hasn't wholly moved past redemption. This changes dramatically in the fourth season, with White now pitted against a man far more ruthless and cunning than himself. This forces White to up his game, to close off his emotions and do whatever it takes to survive and to win.

By this point, it has become redundant to say that the actors are all spectacular, that the writing is tight, the dialogue quotable and the music choices all very strong. The show does have some near-vanishing weaknesses that continue: the tendency to completely drop story elements until they are needed and then bring them back abruptly later on is mildly grating. Remember Walter Jr.'s crowdfunding scheme which Saul co-opts as a money laundering operation? The writers don't, then do, then don't again. The writers also continue to be forever on the verge of giving Marie something to do and then pull back, so for most of the season (and indeed the show) she's just hanging around. Her interaction with Hank in the opening part of the season seems to be setting up a more interesting relationship between them and then goes nowhere.

To find even these criticisms some serious reaching is required. What the show does do brilliantly in its fourth year is finding ways of putting Gus and Walter at loggerheads and showing Walter 'level up' in villainy as he attempts to take on Gus at his own game. The establishing of Gus's own backstory in the episodes Hermanos and Salud (showing that Gus went through a similar process with his own nemesis, Don Eladio) cleverly adds depth to the character as well. The season then culminates in a three-episode run that is wall-to-wall tension, action and drama and ends on a note-perfect moment.

What is also well done is how Jesse becomes a pawn between Gus and Walter, with Gus discovering how to build up Jesse's confidence as a watch of stealing away his loyalty. Walter is forced into some pretty breathtaking and ruthless actions to get that loyalty back, and it's this relationship (sold by the actors with total conviction) that forms the backbone of the season.

4603980,5,B0058YPG1G,"What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very
few series that competes with the best films in history for achievement in cinematic storytelling.
Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing,
full of brilliant plot twists, rich, compelling characters and a pitch-black sense of humor.

A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to
make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking
performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles,
this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and
more disturbing each year.

In a way, thematically it recalls ""The Godfather I and II"" in how that epic charts Michael's journey
from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the endless drive for money
and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an
end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a
game we can never win.

This fourth season take the form of an epic battle for control between Walter and his
nemisis Gus. Along the way Walter's morality crumbles even as he becomes ever more
brilliant at manipulating the people and situations around him. And just enough of his
remaining humanity pokes through to keep us caring in spite of ourselves.
This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff.",1418256000,,1569,4.9356060606060606

4604825,5,B0058YPG1G,"If you thought Season Three was great, hold onto your lunch, hats, seats and whatever else you have lying around. Season Four reaches new heights and finally I'm enjoying the ancillary characters a lot more. Skyler, Hank and Marie, for myself, have finally become interesting. Up through Season Three I really was only interested in scenes involving the drug trade with Jesse and/or Walt in them.

As the cover of the DVD box set shows, this season is all about Walter ""breaking"" very bad in a most dark way. In addition the opening scenes to almost every episode are beyond better than any season before. They really are terrific teasers as you try to figure out what they are foreshadowing.

There are flaws (although not too major and I'll try not to have any spoilers). The major scene in Mexico I find a tad implausible from a ""if it was that easy to do that to the heads of a cartel, why wasn't this done sooner?"" and the old folks' home Terminator ripoff I laughed at. It has impact and is a very powerful and wonderfully shot scene, but also completely ridiculous given the amount of force exerted on the people in question. Hope those are vague enough that I didn't ruin anything for anyone.

Lastly, there're extras on every disc in the set but word of warning: Don't watch any of them until you've watched the entire season. There are subtle giveaways to upcoming episodes on some of the extras.

Plus, as I post this, the entire set is just $9.99. Is that right? An entire season with the extras on DVD for under $10? People, it's worth about triple that easily.",1407369600,,1574,4.551236749116608

4605083,5,B0058YPG1G,"Fantastic series that we watched back to back. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't carry the whole series through streaming, so we did part of it through NetFlix and part through Amazon and the last two seasons through a friend who had the whole series on blue ray.

I will say that there are no hero's in this story, and you pretty much hate everyone all the way through it, but it was fascinating seeing how bad people become bad, that aren't born into it. That is pretty much the whole point of the series, more a slice of life of a drug king pin. Very fun and wild ride with fantastic writing and actors that are just incredible. Highly recommend.",1404000000,,644,4.4576271186440675

I fear there's a bit of Walter White living within each of us!  But I still really like the guy, and I understand his motives.  I feel his pain and find myself continually asking why Skylar has to be such a bitch!!!  The bad guys are as bad as you'll find anywhere!  The worst of the worst!

I enjoyed it even though the level of violence, and the overall bleakness and brutality of the show's world, was sometimes a bit much for my taste.  It is certainly action-packed and suspenseful at every turn.

I wasn't too thrilled with it because I thought it was poorly set up (menus and episode lists on discs) and sometimes the DVDs gave me a lot of trouble getting them to pay. Also, there are no subtitles and I always turn on subtitles for whatever I watch because I tend to miss what people say sometimes. I can get by without the subtitles, but there were long conversations in Spanish and they had no closed captioning for this! I couldn't believe it. I missed the entire scene each time they had these because I can't speak Spanish. That was VERY frustrating.

So far to me, this is the BEST season of Breaking Bad that I have seen, this is such an exciting, unpredictable, thrilling, and explosive season! Absolutely perfect, like a great book, every episode made you wonder and excited to find out what was going to happen next, I don't know how season five or six will be but I am extremely curious to know what the ultimate conclusion for this show will be, it could not possibly have been easy to decide how it will all end, honestly, I think this season alone would have been the PERFECT conclusion. Also, this is by far the most violent of the seasons, very gory murder with a box cutter too.

4605399,5,B0058YPG1G,"Many who followed ""Breaking Bad"" from the start thought by the third season that it was one of the best television shows ever.  The fourth season lived up to the standards of excellence that the series had set, garnering more than a dozen Primetime Emmy Award nominations.  This DVD set contains all 13 episodes of Season Four that originally aired on AMC from July 2011 to October 2011.

These episodes see the relationships between Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and between Walt and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) continue to have their ups and downs depending on the vicissitudes of their involvement in the meth business in Albuquerque.  Survival becomes even tougher as the three sink even deeper into the morass of crime--Walt also lies serially, including lying to himself about his motives.  His pride also comes back to haunt him again at a key moment, leading his DEA brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) to re-open his case.

Another of this season's themes is that life is regressive, as several of the characters find that trouble often snowballs, finding its way to those already in trouble.  The violence of the show becomes even more gruesome in Season Four, but there are also awesome shots of the New Mexico desert.  This season is as superlatively written as its predecessors, with intriguing, unexpected plot twists and a finale that makes the viewer anticipate the fifth and final season.",1393632000,,1443,4.983333333333333
4605400,2,B0058YPG1G,"There's nothing wrong with the story line or episodes in Season 4. The series itself is the best drama ever to come to TV. Period. End of Story, as Betsy Brandt's character is won't to say. That's not the issue. The problem is that for those of us with significant hearing loss who depend on captions or subtitles will find these discs in particular do not have either. The DVDs are in French and Spanish. Well, hallelujah! Twice in Spanish for some stupid reason. I do not speak either language. For unexplained reasons, when Sony Entertainment put this season together wherever they do these things, people speaking English were completely left out of the picture. No captions or subtitles for you, speaker of English. Fooey on you! So, taking the bull by the horns, I finally got a decent answer from Sony quite recently. They apologized and said that this season above all others, made the mistake of no captions or subtitles in English. Does not really make any difference if you have an all-region DVD player. What matters is if you have a decoder. If you are sharp enough to install VLC Media Player onto your home theater operation, more power to you, because it might be able to decode what's on there. Lo and Behold, it might even be English! Good luck with that. I can play the DVD on my computer and VLC is there and able to to decode. Not so with DVD players(2 of them) in my living room where it is more comfortable. Drat! But at least Sony coughed it up and said they goofed up. Imagine that. An apology from this corporate giant. This DVD series is an important season to watch because of what's to come. And I ain't tellin'! Good luck with the captions and subtitle hunt in English.",1393459200,2,1699,4.51948051948052

I was a bit disappointed in the 'first season"" DVD (( I know this is the third, I'm just being candid and don't want to write this review over and over for all seasons)) that there were no subtitles in English for the DVD version  - I like to have those up so I don't miss any of the great dialogue.  Otherwise, this is one of my FAVORITE shows of all time.  Great writing, fantastic characters, interesting pace and entertaining dark comedy mixed in with the serious 'evil' of drug lords.

From the jaw dropping opening Pilot (""I only had you in my heart."") to the heartbreaking Felina, the quality of the five seasons never once dropped from Perfect.

I could go on. I could talk about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bryan-Cranston/dp/B006W0QOF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bryan Cranston</a>'s legendary, immortal performance as high school-teacher-turned-meth-chef Walter White. I could talk at length about the jaw-dropping work from Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, and Bob Odenkirk in their moving, finely crafted roles. I could talk about the perfect use of music and lighting, the camera work and stunning cinematography. I could talk about the writing, sharp and realistic and beautiful. All these and more are the elements (this IS a show about chemistry...) that took Breaking Bad from what it could have been: an entertaining black comedy/drama, into what it is: ""a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell"" of Shakespearean proportions (words of superfan Anthony Hopkins).

But I won't talk about that. I'll just say one thing: watch Breaking Bad. Watch all 57 perfect episodes of it, and when you're done, come back here and drop a comment telling me what you thought. And if I was right...vote Yes. BReaking BAd gets five stars from me.

4605869,3,B0058YPG1G,"""Breaking Bad"" season two was excellent, and season three could be at times sloppy but overall it was very good.  That's why I had high expectations for season four, and that's why I found season four to be quite disappointing.

First, the drug kingpin Gus is the most fascinating character in the ""Breaking Bad"" series, and I expected his character and background to be fully developed with the same nuance and subtlety that went into developing the major characters in the series.  Instead, what we got was a lame backstory and a silly, melodramatic, and not at all believable resolution to the Gus vs. Mexican cartel storyline -- it just seemed lazy and hackneyed writing.

In fact, the entire season seems disjointed, incoherent, and illogical.  There was too much emphasis placed on ""character development,"" which revealed nothing new about the characters and which just stalled the plot.  The way that Gus and Walter used Jesse as a proxy war was an interesting conceit, but given Jesse's absolute loathing of Gus not entirely believable.

The main problem was that Walter White, who was at the very least sympathetic, interesting, and believable as a proud family forced to do wrong in season two and three, descends into madness and ceases to be sympathetic, interesting, and believable -- and in fact by the end of season three Walter becomes a detestable and loathsome character.  This may have been the show's intent, but it made for uncomfortable watching.",1388534400,2,1468,4.987704918032787

The 4th season really ramped up and became even a better show. It is so well written and I am interested in the fact that the characters change during the seasons, whereas most TV series, the characters remain the same throughout the series.

The characters are incredibly real in their response to the evolving dynamics of the subject matter.  The viewer sees the battle and strife of both good and evil at every turn.  The series has been unpredictable and it keeps my attention and interest in viewing the next episode.  This series grabs my attention and that is highly unlike me, as I am so bored and disgusted with our movie and television industry in general.

Whatever you do, be prepared for the best---and I mean the very best---series in television history. Not a wasted scene. Not a wasted line. Not a boring nanosecond. You will find the show just as addictive as the aqua blue meth at its core. Exquisite storytelling; uncanny casting; dry wit that can make you laugh and, a minute later, the next line can make you sob; unexpected, edge-of-the-seat, heart pumping twists and turns; characters with depth, humor, humanity and the Yin Yang of being human. No good guys, no bad guys, just human beings doing what they do with a master chef behind the camera and a team of writers putting all others to shame. Do not miss this. If a television show can make you feel more alive and aware of your every breath, that's saying something. A Masterpiece of storytelling and acting. PS- as hard as I've laughed at the brilliance of Mel Brooks, Larry David or Richard Pryor or the likes of any comic genius of that magnitude, I don't think I ever laughed harder than at ""Fly"", a Breaking Bad episode centering around the killing of a fly in a meth lab.",1385424000,2,1218,4.515837104072398

4606071,5,B0058YPG1G,"More than any show Ive watched on TV in a long time, Breaking Bad leaves me with my jaw on the floor by the end of every episode.  Seasons 2 and 3 might have had one or two episodes that didn't jar me, but Season 4 is brutal from start to finish.  From the first episode, Box Cutter, featuring Gus cutting someones throat open, you know this season will offer some shocking scenes.  Season 4 has several of my favorite episodes of the entire season, including Hermanos (Guss back story), Salud (massive showdown with the Cartel), and the season finale Face Off (which more than lives up to its name).  Rarely does the small screen produce such a big screen level powerhouse, but this show makes me feel like Im watching a movie every episode.  The show never feels episodic; its like an epic novel adapted chapter for chapter, with all of the late-developing plot twists devised right from the very beginning.  Vince Gilligan and the writers seem to know where every character and idea was headed before Season 1 ever hit the air.  Breaking Bad is one of those rare shows that lives up to the hype, and deserves all of the accolades that have been heaped upon it from its inception.  Season 4 not only meets the expectations, but finds a way to actually exceed them.",1385251200,,1266,4.521929824561403

So, I watched the first episode, and I had to have more.  So I bought the first season to see what it would do for me.  And then I NEEDED more.

I've heard some people saying they don't understand why people like a show about Walt when he turns into such a bad guy--but that's the point.  It's a show not about glorifying drugs or violence or glorifying a bad guy.  It's a show about making choices, and the effect that those choices have on us and those around us.  The character development on this show is fantastic and it is intriguing to watch each character make the choices that change his or her life for the better or the worse.  Since finishing the final season of the show, I can't stop thinking about it.  It is hands down, one of the best television shows I have ever seen.",1384300800,,683,4.512195121951219

4606182,5,B0058YPG1G,"Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:

l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, ""Sure, Mom!"" like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and snap back at parents who ask them to do it. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.

2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believable.

3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house-case over.

4. At Tio's when Tuco throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over. When there is a death like Tucos, law enforcement workers search miles around the crime scene.

5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.

6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman/man  on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers. Gilligan shows that he is writing about how he thinks it goes in schools, not how it truly works.

7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.

8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.

9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believable.

10. Hank would have not only driven by the laundry once, he would have been driving by several times and he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night, and sent others to do the same.

11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.

12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.

13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.

14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.

15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.

16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant. The DEA agents would have noticed one of their own acting suspiciously.

17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. DNA does not go anywhere. Also, the magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.

18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.

19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed. All hospitals film everyone coming and going because of having narcotics present in the facilities.

20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.

21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.

22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.

23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.

24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.

25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.

26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.

27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.

28. Once Skyler found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.

29. They can pay $800,000 cash for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????

30. Walt would have been traveling to the Cayman islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.

31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.

32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.

33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.

34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skyler. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, ""Diamonds, that will shut her up.""

35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat in New Mexico with heat in the 100's to 110's?

36. Skyler would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.

37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.

38. The police are portrayed as bumbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believable that no police officer can put two and two together.

39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Junior. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed

40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have done so in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.

41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.

42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.

43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.

44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle or even look dirty. Not believable.

45. Too many bullets fly in the shooting scenes. My brothers both use automatic weapons and I know plenty of law enforcement officials who tell me that when the bullets fly from an automatic rifle, someone dies. Oh, Hank falls to the ground as his defense against automatic weapon fire. Hank would be dead. He would have been hit with many bullets and his head would explode like a watermelon bursting open.

46. Too many dead bodies and no one seems to be missing them. Too many ways both Walt and Jesse would have been seen with the ones they killed. All cities have cameras on the streets. All major roads have ""eye in the sky"" cameras. When people die, relatives know who the last person is that was with them.

47. All in all, too many things just are not believable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.

48. Yes, I know I will get those letters from die hard fans, but get real--DNA would have sunk them after the first murder.

49. Good fantasy, but not good realism.",1382745600,,9228,4.293540945790081
4606183,4,B0058YPG1G,"I never saw this before, then watched the AMC marathon and what I missed in the middle of the night rented the rest, pretty much saw all of the episodes in a week.  But by the end I was enjoying things much less, skipping too even as I paid per episode -- and paying per anything makes for a different experience than getting the programs ""free"" on cable as you are charged anyways.  But The melodramtic plot lines and sheer neverending screaming wears, the show captivates by over-the-top melodramatics and wears for the same reason, however there are moments of quiet.  It's kind of The Walking Dead theory of programming.  In any case, almost all the characters started to seem not shabby and corrupt and less likable -- and I was watching things out of sequence anyways at times -- but just tiresome.  That being said, I can not watch 50 minutes of most TV much less 50 hours, so this was very good relatively.",1382659200,,914,4.515151515151516

This quickly has become an addiction!!  I love watching the entire series all at once but it is so intense doing so because the acting is so incredibly awesome that the next morning I sometimes feel like I'm actually IN the show!  Strange but true.  One of the most amazing shows I've ever seen.  Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Skylar, Marie, Hank, Jr,. they are right up there with The Sopranos other realistic fictional characters that blur the lines of what's real because the acting and writing is amazing and the story is just SO good.  It's impossible to stop watching it--- But of course most people already knew all this about this highly acclaimed show.  I'm just coming to realize it 6 years later.  As I'm watching the end of Season 4, I'm already dreading that it all comes to an end in Season 6.

This is my first experience using Amazon Instant Video.  It should be called Amazing Instant Video.  I am literally able to watch any video I could possibly think of in one-click on my iPad in any location I choose?  It's actually easier and has a much better selection than my cable provider!!

4606226,5,B0058YPG1G,"I find this drama fascinating. There are some that find the aura of menace that runs mostly below (but not always) the surface to be disturbing. What I like is the feeling that life is all too often like this. We get ourselves into predicaments for all the best reasons, even if they exhibit poor judgement, with the best of intentions. We cannot imagine what the consequences might be and then have to deal with them in order to attempt to keep the balance of our lives intact. I am fascinated by how the characters continue to exhibit real world dilemmas and values while confronting psychopathic realities and behaviors in others.

4606366,5,B0058YPG1G,"I have to say that I think the final episode of this season is the single best episode that has ever been on TV.  It is the reason that this show is still so great through the current seasons, and yet I can't help but it got to where it was through a cheat in the story telling.  The entire show has pretty much been flawless and without major gaps in logic or plot holes.  It is just one great twist after another.  What I can say is that is with the exception of this season.  I will say, without giving anything away, that the resolution from last season completely leaves me scratching my head.  Despite the fact that both Walter and Jesse should be in hot water for what they have done, Gus, for some reason, only holds it over Walt's head.  He then goes towards Jesse, to promote him in an attempt to separate Jesse and Walt, when that makes absolutely no sense, considering that he spent all of Season three trying to convince to let Jesse go at best, and kill him at worst, and now because Walt made a mistake and backed his friend, Gus is going to show him the error of his ways by doing the exact same thing.  This is not to say that there are not a lot of great twists and turns, or that Jesse wasn't needed in Gus's corner for the purpose of the finale, but I really found the explanations at the beginning of this season hard to swallow.  Like the reason they didn't trust Walt was because of his personality, which would make sense if they had a crystal ball, but really doesn't make sense considering that to this point, his reasoning to deal with Gus mostly had to do with his need to settle down and stop taking risks.  Like I said, still a great season and a great build up, but what I can say is that for the only time on the show, the writers do cheat a little bit to serve their story, but knowing where it goes from there, I'm rather glad they did.",1380153600,,1870,4.1551246537396125

I haven't seen the last two episodes yet, but I know that it doesn't end well.  How could it?  They hurt people.  People they love.  Just seen the one where Hank is killed.  Sad.  Hank was a really good man, his partner too.  Hank was strong, he was still going to after Walt even though he was his brother-in-law and he had made the video saying that Hank was the one that was involved.  Hank and his partner did not deserve to die, and they didn't deserve to be buried out in the desert.  I feel bad for Marie.  She definately didn't deserve to lose her husband. She is probably the most innocent adult involved.  Except for Junior.  Jessie Pinkman is getting exactly what he deserves.  Being used as a slave.

This season all my suspicions about Pinky and Brain are confirmed:  all the shaved heads represent slave labor at Auschwitz hence Jesse's appearance and persistent look of fear, Jesse and Walt's insistence that they will not work if the other is killed, Alberquerque with its barren landscape and low buildings is Auschwitz and YES! the Axis continues to be behind illicit drug activity worldwide.  Remember that Domingo's cousin was surnamed KOYAMA.

Note the thin SEMITIC character who shrugs ""it's a living"" referring to his salvage business.  Get it?  SALVAGE work in the  Konzentrationslager, or KZ.

And in Giancarlo's unforgettable scene at Casa Tranqillo, you will be reminded of Arnold Schwarzenegger in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>.

This show is instrumental in directing our attention or at least a glance at the Wikipedia page at Nazi-era nuke scientist Werner Heisenberg who PROBABLY had something to do with U-864 (Hitler's Last Deadly Secret). As impressive as Walter White's intellect is, Heisenberg was even smarter which means the British saved the world when they sank the U-Boat containing two Japanese scientists trained in Germany and the components for the A bomb headed for Japan.  So ... that's who we were up against.  Einstein wanted Heisenberg to get the Nobel for Physics - that tells you something.  It wasn't an easy war to end.",1377907200,,1665,5.4319066147859925

4606448,4,B0058YPG1G,"Others have reviewed this show and mentioned that the writing and acting are so exemplary that it makes it difficult to watch other shows.  I concur.  The level of writing and acting is nuanced and layered and OH so believable.  The actors are obviously enjoying the tremendous material they have been given as it must be rewarding to use your talents so completely and deeply.  I am saddened that the show is almost done.  I NEVER but TV shows.  It's TV for goodness sake!  But, I buy these because it is better to watch this show without commercials as you would a movie.  I refuse to watch the last season that is on now so that I can buy it later.  Yes, it is that good.

O.K., I don't like this season as well because I can't get past the way the baby, Holly, is treated.  I watch certain scenes and wonder, ""Where is the baby!!!""  Any parent can attest that a newborn is an all-consuming job and Walt and Skyler seem to treat her like a handbag; carrying her around in a car seat.  I think that aspect of Walt's personality should have been more developed as a means to convey tension between home Walt and lab Walt (friend George and work George--tee hee).

4606453,4,B0058YPG1G,"I loved Season One, was disappointed in the second and third and was was happily surprised when Season Four picked up again.  There's plenty of action, some new locales---the Drug dealer's nice spread in Mexico and a nursing home and a car wash in Albuquerque.  Jesse goes through some major changes and grows from a punk kid to a responsible adult....well as responsible as a meth maker could be said to be.  He finds a new love which helps him and shaves his head which gives him a new mean, lean look...matching that of the new Walt.  Walt is still Walt, flayling around, but he, too, is helped out in this series by the knowledge of Sklyer so we don't have the constant drain of his energy by having to lie to her.  Now he just lies to Hank and Marie but they seem so inconsequential that we don't much care. I have to say that in the final scene he looks....magnificent!  It does concern me that Walt, who is a sweet loving father never seems to think about what meth actually does to young people.  He stays in his clean lab and it's Jesse who rubs shoulders with the meth heads who are not an attractive bunch.

I think what adds too to the entertainment value of this season are the supporting characters who are by now more well-developed.  First off is the amazing Gustavo Fring. Who could have conceived of a such a character...a  brilliant, hyper-polite, Black Chilean chicken cook/drug dealer?!  His treatment of his trusted aid with the box cutter was chilling, to say the least.  And his amazing courtesy, his super straight posture, his skill in the kitchen....what a guy!  The actor's face is quite beautiful, I think, reminding me of the mask of an Egyptian pharoah and time after time we see his expression change just imperceptibly to give a hint of what's really going on inside.  He did a brilliant job.  I liked the way the writers didn't reveal  Gus's back story until this episode.  I kept wondering what would have made such a nice-looking man so dangerous.  This episode gave us the answer and also hinted at his friendship with Gale, the young chemist.  I loved his name, too...so perfectly odd.  I checked in the Albuquerque phone book and found no Fring.

We meet the too-good-looking Ted Beneke again and he shows more of his slimey personality.  Too bad about that rug, Ted!

Saul Goodman is hilarious and brings comic relief to each scene he appears in as well as some practical advice to our boys.  Saul's a snappy dresser, too...you gotta love him.

The 12-step group gave another interesting change of pace.  I loved the scene in which Jesse broke into a rage at the leader who kept advising him to ""accept"" himself and his actions.  Yea Jesse...he remains the voice of authenticty in the show, even as he does have his own ups and downs.

Mike is intriguing, too.  The sweet grandpop who bought balloons to his grandchild and who seems to have a warm spot in his heart for Jesse, is also capable of a lot of killing.  Did they leave him behind in Mexico?  I hope he comes back.

All is all I think there was enough interesting human drama going on to offset the sheer violence.  That's what made this season better than the last two.  I hope it keeps up.",1377043200,,3191,4.511343804537522

4606584,5,B0058YPG1G,"Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.

Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.

At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.

Molecular visuals of METH.
Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.

After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.

For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.

At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.

Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.

DISCUSSION:

I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:

Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?",1373846400,,5265,4.792723263506064
4606585,5,B0058YPG1G,"Many TV series get old after a few seasons...not this one.  Although it starts off a bit slow IMHO, the last 1/2 of the season is very well put together and entertaining.",1373673600,,170,4.3125

The only way I can watch this is in a marathon with one episode after the other because there is no way to wait a week for each new episode. The story, the character development, the character interplay, the incredible acting, the cinematography, are all incredibly well done. This is purely adult stuff and among adults, not for the faint of heart. Some of it is tough to watch, but if you can handle it, you will be rewarded.",1372550400,,484,4.511363636363637

4606632,2,B0058YPG1G,"Even though the package says there is closed captioning, there is not. I believe this is a manufacturing defect.  I've written to Sony to David Bishop, President, Worldwide SonyPictures Home Entertainment, and though he forwarded my request to his consumer affairs department, they have just given me the runaround and there has been no action.  This was a gift for my father who is hard of hearing and needs the closed captioning to be able to follow the story. I said to Mr. Bishop:  I purchased all four seasons of  the AMC series ""Breaking Bad"" on DVD for my father who is elderly and hard of hearing.  I chose these DVDs because they included the ""CC"" code on the package which convinced me they had closed captioning encoding on the disk.  This is important to me for my father, but you probably know that 48M people in the US (up to 15% of your customers) are deaf or have some degree of hearing loss. Providing accessibility extends your audience reach in the deaf community, as well as helps you meet legal requirements.  As the population ages, the number of people relying on closed captioning will surely rise.

Closed captioning has been provided on a voluntary basis by many movie producers, studios, and distributors for movie videos and DVDs produced for sale or rent.  Though it is voluntary, having the symbol of ""CC"" on the packaging would seem to me to be a promise that the disks were, indeed, encoded with closed captioning.  Sadly, I tried to display this on several devices and on my PC using Windows Media Player as well as HP's TouchSmart DVD player.  It does not display on any of our three DVD players.  I do not believe the closed captioning tracks exist.

There are subtitles, but only in French and Spanish .  English subtitles could have helped my Father since he is not totally deaf, but you do not have English subtitles on any of them.

I paid more than $60 for all four seasons.  Ive disappointed my father who was looking forward to them.  So, I am appealing to you to explain why you have not included the Closed Captioning on these DVDs.  Your company is a leader in the industry and even though you're not required to encode the Closed Captioning, putting it on the package is a promise that was not fulfilled.  Had I known, I would not have purchased them for him.

I learned that you distinguished yourself for leading the industry in the initial launch of DVDs while at MGM and with you at the helm, MGM received numerous prestigious customer service awards.  I am only one customer, but I do feel I am speaking not only for myself, but for 48 million customers who also need your leadership.  I look forward to understanding this situation more and I hope for a solution from your customer service team right away.  (Dad isn't getting any younger)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is sad when Sony can take our money and not be responsive to a report of a defect. In my research, I've learned that many of Sony's DVDs seem to have this defect when it comes to closed captioning.  I would be very wary of purchasing any more DVDs from Sony.",1371081600,3,3172,4.755027422303473

It had me glued to my seat. Once again, as in all the previous seasons, the acting is superb. It is beautifully shot, with lots of close ups and plenty of emotion to keep you hooked until the final episode.",1369180800,,298,4.155172413793103
4606712,5,B0058YPG1G,"I don't watch TV unless it is truly a well-written piece - a quasi-work of art, even.  I do not have a lot of time to watch television and so when I do, I can't stand having my time wasted by the reality/competition-genre garbage that fills the primetime hours on most of the major American networks.  My tendency is to watch era-driven shows (Boardwalk Empire [1920s Jersey], Rome [Caesar's fall from grace], Mad Men [the 60s], Game of Thrones [a stretch, but let's say the Middle Ages meets fantasy land], etc.).  Long story short: I never thought a show about drugs could captivate my attention, but boy... was I wrong!

I don't want to give anything away, but I have never seen a character develop in such a remarkable way -- I cannot believe that AMC was able to take a tale of two meth cooks and develop their characters to such an extent.  (You will never see a character change so much - and in such a believable way - again, I don't think.)  This is definitely a character piece but with a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout all of the seasons.  Remarkable acting by Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston, especially in season 4 (which I think is the best so far, though I am not quite through the first half of the 5th yet).  Give this show a chance -- season 1 is slow and not great, but keep watching and once you get a few episodes into season 2, you'll be hooked and I am convinced that you too will share in my sentiment that Breaking Bad is by far, the best show on television.",1369180800,,1510,4.273684210526316
4606713,5,B0058YPG1G,"******Everyone Seems to have FINALLY caught on to ""Breaking Bad.""  You wouldn't be reading this review unless you needed a copy; be it for to see it again, archival, or Gifting. if you skip this review, do yourself (AND ME, LOL) a favor and skip all the way down to the last bullet point before you move on...

***** I'm sorry, ****PLEASE READ A DIFFERENT REVIEW**** if you are looking for a review of characters,  plots, or screenplay, etc. This review applies ONLY to the DVD format of the Complete Fourth Season (and also to all of the Complete Seasons that are available to stream, which I have.

* These are DVD's of the shows as they originally aired, in what i call ""TV Widescreen, which is really 1080P,"" at the original 44 minutes per episode with NO advertising whatsoever. There are some previously ""unseen"" scenes, on Many Seasons, but the deleted scenes are shown later in the Bonus Material, as Deleted scenes, and not in a ""Director's Cut"" type of format. There are a fair amount extras too.  When i say ""Fair"", I mean it's ""Probably"" NOT ENOUGH for the SuperFan, and probably too many for the average Joe/Jane, and will never be watched.  I don't believe there is a different version available.  What a tragedy.  Often, the Bonus Material after a show Gives Major Insights into said show. The Bonus material chosen for this DVD release is of High-Quality.  There could have been MORE, but I'm comparing an under-funded, well-run, ""Expertly"" casted, Amazingly Acted, runaway Late-Night Cable TV drama, that ""Took a chance"" with it's viewing demographic, and is REAPING the rewards... to a BlockBuster Motion Picture, and their 9-figure budgets. Bravo AMC!

* I love all my physical copies of movies (And TV shows. I still have ACTUAL working BetaMax tapes...AND...a player.  It is used about once per 10 years.  Every different format of a movie has different characteristics, strengths, weaknesses. We have had MANY ""Top Quality"" VHS (& Beta) movies that the DVD transfer went horribly wrong. I'm talking about the re-release that THE STUDIO did, and not a copy on my home equipment!!! Some have been fixed.  Some haven't.  Some of these major issues never get addressed at all, and a re-mastered Blu-Ray is your only choice to get a decent copy, but with this Series, That Is Not The Case! (I'm speaking of ""other"" shows and films, NOT this one!) Some have been cut, and re-formatted for the old shape TVs.  Hey, no laughter, Some people still HAVE & USE at lease 1 of those (Including my bedroom and guest room).

* This DVD Release IS A GOOD ONE! The transfer went well, and for my ""Personal Taste"", there is no need AT ALL for me to OWN a Blu-Ray copy of this type of a TV Series, especially just a single season, for a much higher price tag than a DVD played through an up-convert player (that will Look and sound virtually identical on every system in the house, from the lowliest one in the basement workshop, to the ""5-figure"" Entertainment System in your main Theater. *****Yes, a Blu-Ray will actually look and sound better than an ""up-converted"" standard DVD, but since this isn't a big special effects Action Movie, I assure you, the difference between an up-converted DVD and a Blu-Ray is ""Negligible in this type of situation, unless you happen to have an absurdly large TV such as a 100 Inch HD Projector.""
Many ""TV"" Shows fall under this category ""For Me.""  I want to own a ""quality"" copy of the ENTIRE SERIES; EVERY SEASON, as they are released; and I'm NOT willing to wait for the entire series to be released in a boxed-set, at even HIGHER prices...ESPECIALLY If I had not seen the series yet. (That is the most important thing.  Start, or continue watching Breaking Bad, and all the other cool programming that AMC has given us for many years now.

* This is a straight digital transfer and looks ALMOST EXACTLY as it was originally aired (depending on your player (up-converting dvd or Blu-Ray, and also on the quality of the  original Cable, Satellite, or digital ""air"" broadcast. The original might not have been shot in HD, and unless the studio ""Re-Mastered yet AGAIN, for HD, then owning a blu-ray of this season ALONE makes absolutely ZERO SENSE. The exceptions i find ""acceptable although unnecessary"" include that you or the person you are buying for ALREADY have started your or their collection in the Blu-Ray Format, and you want to keep consistent with the little blue boxes and not the slightly bigger black ones. WHO'S IDEA WAS IT TO CHANGE THE SHAPE OF A DISC CASE? THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THEM THE SAME SIZE, BUT STILL BLUE.  Also, even more of us, from the younger generations, are converting our ""entire"" collections from DVD to Blue-Ray, and then the youngest generation is going straight to Digital ""Cloud"" copies of EVERYTHING.

* (Most Important...) What type of FAN you are of the series? Are you a SuperFan that needs to watch EVERY Episode AS THEY AIR? ...And Then Buy them IMMEDIATELY as they are released in Blu Ray 7.1 Surround 3-D?

* Have you ever even seen a single episode? Are you interested in ""Catching Up"" as soon as possible, so that you may watch the FINAL SEASON ""as it airs"", Very Soon This Year? (Last 8 episodes... Can't Wait :-D)

* Or, are you possibly thinking of using this product as a Gift?

* Are you the casual fan that ""Wants"" to see as many episodes as possible, in order?

* Well, all but Season 6 has aired.  Also, All seasons except for 5&6 are available for FREE STREAMING, and Season 5 is available, for a little cash to stream, or buy, and it's available if you have the DVD option on NetFlix. You could also easily wait for Season 5 to be released in a ""Free"" streaming format. (It probably will be soon (probably right about when season 6 begins to air); i apologize for not knowing that! (LOL, that is yet another good reason for owning DVD format copies in the much cheaper version than Blu-Ray...DVD....the ability to loan and borrow them for free  Ha, that could be a ""perk"" OR a ""Liability.""

* Many times we discover a brand new series available for digital download that have been running hits for seasons and seasons. (If the HORRIBLE SITUATION comes up, and it ALWAYS DOES ACCORDING TO MURPHY) on Long, Popular, ""Currently Running"" TV Series', where you find yourself caught BETWEEN the LAST season YOU have seen for FREE Download, The BRAND NEW SEASON is just about to start, and there is an ENTIRE season you haven't seen yet, right in the middle, never fear, there are still ways.  Usually one can PAY a small price per episode (and possibly even less for the entire season), and They are ALWAYS available for Purchase BEFORE they are available for FREE (Whether it's a download or a physical copy bought in a store.)  SOMETIMES, if you have Xfinity, they are available for free just as early, but don't ""Count"" on that. Sometimes other websites have digital copies available for download, but watch out.  Some of these sites have, at best, bad picture quality, and at worst, some of them are breaking the law by showing shows they know they have no right to show, but still do.

* (This is important:) This is the ""Positively"" the BEST format for yourself, or as a gift, for someone who might ALREADY OWN seasons 1-3 IN THE DVD FORMAT, and now they can continue their collection as they prefer.

****************NOTE, If you just want to ""jump on the band wagon"" and see one of the most amazing shows in decades (even though you are late,  THIS SHOW IS SOOOOOO GOOD, ... That ""FASTER"" is Definitely FAR MORE important than your format you choose, then as quickly as possible go to a free video service such as Amazon, or Hulu or NETFLIX, and watch all the seasons they currently have.  Then check ON DEMAND if you are an XFINITY CUSTOMER. If you have a DVD option (additional $) on your Netflix Account, you can get the DVD's through the mail MUCH earlier than you can stream (Download) them. Or you can go to a pay site such as Amazon or iTunes and buy episodes of any season, or any entire season that has been released.

***And just because I don't KNOW about all the features that Amazon has to offer, doesn't mean I'm trying to steer the reader away from the Amazon Options.  I'm just ignorant about all they have to offer.  Maybe they have better prices and earlier dates than the other guys. Who Knows?

I don't know if this kind of talk is anything more than a lot of hyperventilating and knee-bouncing, but it's tough to deny that Breaking Bad, to paraphrase a line from an earlier season, has made a lot of hay from what initially seemed like a short-fuse premise. As it turns out, the balancing act at the center of it allWalter's willingness to do whatever it takes (up to and including homicide) to protect his family, offset by his character deficiencies and extraordinary ordinarinessis the story gift that keeps giving, and powers most of the episodes, up to and including the fourth-season finale.",1364169600,,854,4.777027027027027

4606927,2,B0058YPG1G,"Seasons 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad are, quite simply, some of the best, most exhilarating hours of TV we've ever seen. But season 3 grew increasingly lame, and season 4 is even duller--less believable plotlines, less interesting writing, less interesting characters, and a lot of filler. It's sad to see something so phenomenal deteriorate into something barely worth watching.

4606933,3,B0058YPG1G,"This was a typically great season of BB with a heart-pounding final episode, but my issues are with the blu-ray transfer itself, which was remarkably flawed and not consistent with the excellent quality of the previous three seasons. The image is incredibly blurry at times, as if some kind of digital noise reduction was used, resulting in weird flaws like frames appearing to blur into one another, causing characters' facial features to appear to jump around (it's hard to describe, you just have to see it). The video also appears to have been compressed to an unusual degree, evident in the banding that shows up in some scenes, in particular the ugly pixellated streak scene in the pool of blood during the boxcutter scene from episode one. There's even an inordinate amount of color shifting and flickering, defects I would expect to see in a poor transfer of a movie made 40 years ago, not in a tv series from 2011.

I don't know what went wrong here - I hope AMC didn't screw up the Mad Men season 5 set like this. I buy blu-ray for the mouth-watering image quality, and this was a confusing disappointment. Strangely I've only seen a few complaints on the web - bluray.com is the only site I've seen who noticed issues with the image quality, and even they said it only looks that way in certain scenes, while hidefdigest.com gave it a 4.5 for picture and said it was consistent with the other seasons. Maybe there are two versions of the blu-ray somehow, and one has screwed up image quality? I've noticed people complaining about the lack of subtitles in a certain scene, and my copy has subtitles during that scene, so perhaps that's the case, but that still doesn't explain the overall off quality here. Maybe the usual authoring guys were tied up and some flunky stepped in a ruined the batch? Could be.",1362960000,,1818,4.645962732919255

Hard to explain but this show is full of surprises.  Acting is superb and story lines are amazing.  Every detail is important and everything ties together.

This show is not for kids.  It is gritty, graphic and deals with the drug trade.  It is full of bizare, sick and funny situtations that have you on the edge of your seat.  It is also a realistic story of a family dealing with tough issues.

Even the character actors who fill the lesser roles are extremely well written, and as my wife points out the casting is spot on.  The beauty of watching t.v. on demand (or on disk) is the ability to watch your fill in one sitting and my wife and I enjoyed doing so with this and every season of Breaking Bad.

Loved Homeland, big fan of Boardwalk Empire, used to be a big fan of the Sopranos...
BUT NOTHING COMPARES to the brilliant, take-charge role of Walter White as played by Bryan Cranston,
Aaron Paul's great Jesse Pinkman role...love the creepy lawyer in it...and Dean Norris is superb, as is Anna Gunn,
the great son with mild C.Palsy....they're all magnificent.
And oh, just adore Giancarlo Esposito.
Thank you to all.",1360195200,,527,5.1395348837209305

4607197,5,B0058YPG1G,"Such an amazing series! We are HOOKED!

But beware - it is dark, depressing and pretty violent. Not for the faint of heart or emotionally fragile. Definitely NOT a feel good series...

Awesome writers, amazing music, and great cast.

Long live Walter White!",1360022400,,257,4.930232558139535

4607199,5,B0058YPG1G,"Just a masterpiece -- powerful, uncompromising, male, clever. Existential one in pure form. The most relevant issues of life are raised:  life crisis of a fifty-year-old intellectual, modern escapism, drug addiction, a self-identification problem, a cancer, the relations of spouses and different generations. What is good and what is bad? A talk about event interaction in life can be felt through all the series.
The philosophy of a self-made man who being a school chemistry teacher turns into a productive professional drug manufacturer is very controversial and concerns ethics issues. Watching ""Breaking bad"" is not just killing the time but going deep into thoughts of moral, human standards and social structure.
I guess I feel as a part of that movie and really share all their hardships with them lol",1359936000,,810,5.230769230769231

4607233,5,B0058YPG1G,Dish Network dropped the AMC channel for a while and so I streamed Breaking Bad episodes to my tv from Amazon (using a Roku box).  Picture quality was very good and Breaking Bad is possibly my favorite program of all time.,1359936000,,222,4.414634146341464

Literally.  Best ending to a season I have ever seen in my life. Trust me, you will think so too.  Unfortunately, they must have fired the writing staff from season 4 because season 5 is terrible. Oh well.",1359590400,,373,4.333333333333333
4607270,5,B0058YPG1G,Love this show.  I have never been addicted (ha ha) to a show ever.  I wish it could go on for at least 10 seasons but I think 2013 is suppose to be the last.  If you never have watched Breaking Bad you need to give it a try - there is a reason why Bryan Cranston won the Emmy three seasons in a row for lead actor in a drama and why he won best actor again with a Screen Acotr award for 2013.,1359590400,,393,3.6

4607272,5,B0058YPG1G,"We ordered this season just before Netflix made season 4 available, but we're not sorry. We absolutely HAD to know what happened in season 4 before season 5 got started.

The extras are interesting, and something we wouldn't have gotten from streaming the episodes. This was definitely worth it.",1359417600,,295,5.020408163265306

4607277,5,B0058YPG1G,"When I first started watching Breaking Bad, it was hard to tell a difference between this series and Weeds.  I say this because they are both about drugs, but after watching all four seasons I now see the difference.  The first season I felt was really slow and boring, but once you get into season two, you cannot stop watching.  The plot is set up greatly.  The episodes will start off with a flashback or a flash forward.  This makes you want to see more because you do not know when you will be able to view this clip.  The storyline makes sense.  A high school science teacher who has a pregnant wife, and has recently found out he has cancer, needs to make some money fast and easily.  When season four hits, Walt is willing to do whatever it takes to keep himself alive.  Thinking about it, who wouldn't try to keep themselves alive?  When you get to the last episode of season four, it leaves you hanging.  You know that the bomb was significant and caused a lot of damage, but it saved Walt and Jesse's lives.  My question is will Jesse ever find out what Walt did?  If he was to figure it out what would happen to their relationship?  Knowing that season five is out there, I want to view it right away.  I suggest this series if anyone is into watching action.  It is never ending and always keeps you hanging.",1359158400,,1321,4.308943089430894

The show is considered fiction, but is also a fact of todays life. The situation is a bit overdone to make a point and it does!! You find out that good people can do ""bad"" things and it allows you into a world you might not ever see otherwise. It shows the audience both sides of a very controversial subject.

Can it happen?  Yes!!!  Does it happen?  Yes!!!  See for yourself; decide for yourself and learn to understand the many sides of life that so many people go through.  Watch this with open eyes and you will find yourself immersed in the life of Walt and his ""family.""

I don't miss it.  If I can't see it when it is on, I tape it to watch later. It is gripping, fascinating, and keeps my attention glued to the TV for a fast passing one hour of breathtaking story.

4607861,5,B0058YPG1G,"""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"".""

Season 1-3 were the pledge. Seasons 4 and 5 part 1 were the Turn. Season 5 part two, will be the prestige.

This is without dought or reservation, the most amazing well writen series that's been put out there on television in thirty years.
I've turned many people onto this series and as predicted, they all came back hooked and having to watch the entire four and a half years worth of episodes.

4607960,5,B0058YPG1G,"BREAKING BAD is maybe the most addictive show on TV now with the possible exception of THE WALKING DEAD.  I watched the three previous seasons on DVD and tore into season 4 as soon as the set arrived from Amazon.  It did not disappoint as the story of cancer stricken chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine cook Walter White spiraled even further out of control.

From the opening episode, Box Cutter, that resolves season 3's cliffhanger to the final confrontation with drug kingpin/chicken franchise owner, Gus Fring in the season ending episode, Face Off, the tension is non stop as it is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels. Watching these characters stew in a hell of their own making makes for terrific drama.  Everyone is back for the ride: Walter, Jesse, Skylar, Hank, Mike, Marie, Gus, Walter Jr. Saul, and even nasty old Uncle Tio, who plays a very significant part in the action before the season is done.

Impossible as it seems, Walter's life becomes even more complicated this season: he's increasingly on thin ice with Gus; his partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, is starting to have divided loyalties; wife Skylar is buying a car wash as a cover to launder all the money Walt's meth making as brought in and trying to help her shifty former boss dodge the IRS at the same time; and his DEA agent brother in law, Hank, is sniffing at Gus's trail and getting closer to the laundry that houses Walt and Jessie's meth lab.  At every turn, Walter is finding himself in ever more desperate straits.

And the viewer is left with the question first posed back in the very first episode: is Walter White a good man forced by dire circumstances to do bad things or was he an evil man all along, whose dark nature was liberated by his own very bad choices? There's no definitive answer in Season 4 for me, but the final image of the season ender will make up the mind of many viewers.

The acting is exceptional, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter; he literally makes us feel this character's rage, panic and sheer hell bent determination in every line of dialogue and smallest gesture.  But all high praise to Aaron Paul as Jesse, Anna Gunn as Skylar, Dean Norris as Hank; Bob Odenkirk as Saul, Jonathon Banks as Mike, Mark Margolis (who does it all with his eyes) as Uncle Tio, and certainly to Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring, the perfect embodiment of ice cold evil.  Because of these great actors, we feel we know their characters much better then they know themselves.  And let's not leave out the fine writing and directing.

Is BREAKING BAD a scathing commentary on the decline of the middle class or a 21st Century film noir?  Let the viewer make up their own mind,  For me, it's the kind of riveting drama that movies and regular network television don't seem to want to provide anymore.  Just watch episode 10, titled Salud, and you'll see what I mean.  I so enjoy watching series like this on DVD where I can devour multiple episodes in one sitting instead of having the network dole out one show a week at a time.",1353369600,,3036,4.615241635687732

Bryan Cranston gives a haunting, hypnotic performance as Walter White trying to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself into with meth kingpin Gustavo ""Gus"" Fringe. This season trumps the 3 before it and you'd be a fool not to pick this up if you like Breaking Bad at all. This is the best show on television and I would really pay no attention to the idiots who have given this anything less then 5 Stars.

Of all the season sets for Breaking Bad this one stands out the most due to having the biggest variety of extras spanning from deleted and extended scenes, gag reels and special featurettes.

The most notable featurette gives an inside look at the making of Gus Fring's final scene of the season and is definetely worth a look",1349568000,,525,4.822222222222222

4608178,5,B0058YPG1G,"I am so amazed at how good this television series is.  There seems to be a well planned story that is realized almost perfectly by the cast and everyone else involved.  This season Walt is in total fear of his life.  While he is able to make meth is a state of the art meth lab set up by Gus Fring, he gradually realizes that Gale, a scientific meth maker, is being groomed to take over for Walt.  Walt is not going to die from his cancer but murdered by Mike, Gus' primary hit man.  Jesse is also being worked with to see if he can develop alliances with Gus and turn away from his loyalty to Walt.  The season builds and builds to an amazing conclusion.  All the time his brother in law Hank is following his trail without realizing it even from a wheelchair.  Skyler begins to operate a car wash to launder meth money and begins to take some gangster traits of her own.  Who survives and dies is an overarching question in this season but it also takes a good look at how the carnage and goings on affect the survivors.  Some retain a sense of morality even if warped but others seem to become convinced of their own immortality and claim the right to protect themselves from others no matter what the cost.  The show creates interesting insight into the characters.  The term Breaking Bad seems to mean a person who breaks through the barrier of good and bad and enters into the ""bad"" world.",1348099200,,1395,4.323076923076923

4608260,5,B0058YPG1G,"No other show is as rewarding for paying attention to the little details. This show forgets NOTHING! Something you might deem insignificant can come into play later on in a major way.

No other show can keep me on the edge of my seat like this one. It's my favorite of all time, and this season is as great as the ones that came before it. The last 6 episodes of the season is probably the greatest stretch of episodes the show has ever had, and without the first 7--which people might consider slow and not much happened--they wouldn't be as great as they are.

The last 5 minutes of 4x11: 'Crawl Space' got the reaction from me that horror movies (and other shows) only wish they could achieve. It might be the greatest moment of the show to date, and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and I think I did both at the same time.

They say that the acting can only be as good as the writing, but I think they both work off of each other to create this brilliant show.",1347580800,,971,4.181818181818182

Not only is season 4 the best so far but the video and audio presentation with the blu ray is spectacular.  The black/white ratio is perfect and colors are vibrant and pop when necessary and subdued when in need.  The picture always has superb clarity and detail.  The beautiful outdoor shots which are a big part of this show look amazing.  Flesh tone is always realistic.  And the audio is perfection.  From hearing a pin drop to a gun shot the sound is always strong, clear and direct.  Dialogue is prominent and comes from the speakers strong and central.  The surround speakers are put to amazing use with this season.  Each episode here varies from dialogue driven scenes to powerful dramatic action scenes and the DTS 5.1 audio makes it even better.

This is one show where the blu ray provides a far superior viewing experience to the dvd.  And that is saying a lot for the dvd also looks excellent.  BREAKING BAD is an amazing show with an overall plotline that crosses over so many different emotions and varying subject matter.  And the acting is excellent.  The entire cast from Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn just to mention a few continue to meet the high level of expertise this series demands.  It is surely one of the best drama series to ever be on television.  And the season 4 blu ray comes with amazing bonus features.  There are over 15 hours of them from an extended version of the amazing season finale, interviews, deleted scenes, alternate takes and a gag reel.  The list goes on and on.  Bottom line, BREAKING BAD season 4 is a must for fans and the entire series is a must for fans of high quality television.  There is no waste in the extras.  It is a feast of information and background on this amazing series.  As I said, every season of this series is exceptional and highly recommended but with season 4 the show reached new highs.

The Lilllie's of the Valley sitting next to Walter's pool make us wonder if Walter poisoned Brock in an effort to make Jess think Gus did it so Jess would help him eliminate Gus. This makes the transformation of Walter clear. He will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, no matter who he has to hurt. Jess still clings to his humanity and has definite limits to what he will do for money. This story of how circumstances, illness, greed etc. can transform a person is one of the best I have seen, and tells it's story without preaching but by showing the changes that take place.",1344729600,,703,4.293233082706767

4608538,5,B0058YPG1G,"The fourth season of the groundbreaking and critically acclaimed series, Breaking Bad opens with an episode that contains a shockingly gruesome act of violence (don't worry, no spoilers here) and concludes with an episode that features another shocking scene--perhaps the most jaw-droppingly violent in the show's four season run.  The two episodes serve as bookends to what is the most suspenseful, unsettling and violent batch of episodes yet. In fact, season four just may be the best yet which is going to place a lot of pressure on creator Vince Gilligan to bring things to a fitting conclusion with the upcoming fifth and final season.

Anyone who has followed the series this far knows that there is no turning back now, not for the audience or for Walter White who has reached a point of no return.  When Breaking Bad debuted back in 2008, Walt was a flawed but sympathetic antihero.  Stricken with cancer, he opted to use his impressive knowledge of chemistry to cook and sell Crystal Meth in order to make quick money and leave a nest egg behind for his family.  But instead Walt has become an addict himself.  Not to the drug the manufactures and peddles, but to the endless cash flow it provides and to the sense of power that goes along with being a drug kingpin.  Season four finds Walt's transformation from mild mannered chemistry teacher and self loathing door matt to a black hearted villian nearly complete.  When he snarls at Skyler that, ""I am the danger!"" it's clear that there is no hope of redemption for him.  Perhaps most disturbing is that he doesn't appear to be too concerned with that.  You almost get the sense that he has become the man that he has always wanted to be.

Cranston's performance is, as usual, superb and another Emmy win will likely be coming his way.  But every player in the ensemble is excellent as well.  Aaron Paul continues to bring new dimensions to Jesse who spends a large chunk of this season trying to come to terms with his murder of Gail at the end of Season three.  Anna Gunn portryas Skyler as a woman who is frightened yet resourceful and Dean Nooris as Walt's DEA angent brother-in-law continues to flesh out his character while positioning him to become a major foe for Walt in the show's final season.  And then there's Gus.  Portrayed brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito, he provides much of the sense of dread that runs throught season four.  It is absolutely fascinating to watch the cat and mouse game that plays out between he and Walter.  There is only room for one of these two in the meth business and season four barrels toward that inevitable conclusion like a freight train.

How this will all end is anyone's guess but it sems more than likely that it won't be good.  Walt is in too deep and seems to have lost his soul quite a while ago.  The ultimate question may turn out not to be if Walter White will die, but rather will he rediscover his own humanity before that time comes.  That, more than anything else is what has driven this brilliant series from the very beginning.",1344470400,,3054,4.6270871985157696

Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman has a lot of character development during this season, and I cannot for a second imagine Walter without Jesse.

There's a lot of darkness involved in this season, and I have to say of them all season four is by far my favorite.  These characters are incredible, and I only wish I could meet the entire cast and crew so I could shake all of their hands and express how much I love this entire experience.

The acting is phenomenal; the writing is top notch; the story lines will hook you in quick and leave you aching for that next episode.

Not to mention, with how dark the show gets it's amazing how they can find laugh out loud humor in it fairly frequently without taking you out of it.

Also, remember to start from season 1, episode 1. This is not the show you start watching at season 4. You need to see where these characters begun to understand where they are now and to fully appreciate where they are now in their lives.

4608819,1,B0058YPG1G,"UPDATE: I have been told that the Breaking Bad DVD's contained a defective batch of DVD's that used only the Spanish audio WITHOUT sub-titles. This is obviously the version I bought. But, I've been so pissed off about this whole problem that I'm through with this whole subject matter. The plain truth is that Breaking Bad started out with a couple of seasons of great shows...but then has drizzled off to mediocrity by the ending which I no longer care about.

The director and producers are getting a little too cocky about their shows success if they think they can insult our intelligence by expecting us to waste time trying translate all the Spanish bulls*** the characters are saying for  13 minutes in Season 4 episodes.

What creative brainstorm are the producers going to try next?  Black out the screen for entire segments of the show because that will be cool and different and help us all imagine what the show would be like if we were blind for 13 minutes? Methinks the producers and writers are sampling ""too much product"" which interferes with rational creative decisions.  That whole Spanish segment ruined the ""suspended disbelief"" and magic of the show for me. I pushed ""EJECT"" on my DVD player and loaded in a better movie to watch.

Just for writing my opinion here, I suppose I'll be chastised for not drinking the kool-aid of the politically correct fanatics. But I'll be damned if I'll tolerate the force-feeding of Spanish dialogue on a popular show. I feel like a sucker for being a fan if this is what they think of us viewers.

With any great TV show that continues for a few seasons, one begins to wonder whether it will start to lose it's zap.  I can tell you that Breaking Bad still has all of it's zap, and remains, for me, one of the best TV shows of all time.  I don't make that comment lightly; I have seen a lot of good shows, only a few of which I would call terrific, and I don't often give five stars.

The pattern for this season is familiar.  Having resolved the cliff hanger at the end of the last season, there is a bit of catching their breath, or is it cleaning up the wreckage, or even more correctly building a grim ""bottom"" upon which to build the new story of the fourth season.  Things are REALLY bad, and really broken.  Broken Bad.  For me, it was at this point, in the ultra-grim second episode, that it was clear what the only possible solution could be.  I think this was deliberate, that they set the agenda, and indeed the outcome, of this season, early on.

But it seemed quite impossible to get there.  How could they get there?  How WOULD they get there?  DO they indeed get there?  I won't answer these questions, because therein lies the joy, and the jolt, of watching this show.

I can tell you that after the grim second episode, it's like getting into a train that begins to accelerate on shaky tracks, and going faster and faster.  Minute by minute, it seems like it is going to jump the tracks.  At times, it seems like it already has jumped those tracks.

Eventually, the metaphorical train rushes, unstoppable, to the inevitable end of the season, and what a season climax it is.  What happens seems impossible, and I think it is, but they had lot of fun doing the impossible.

If you're interested in the fun they had doing it, they have a documentary on just the season finale for your enjoyment after you finish the episodes, on the last disc of the DVD set.  Because this is one memorable season finale, with imagery you won't soon forget, and it's worth learning more about it.",1342483200,,2008,4.372972972972973

It reminded me of how amazing season 4 was and to REFRESH my memory I watched the whole thing over again. Not ONE other show on television (perhaps the sopranos) can compare to the magnitude and ENGAGEMENT of this show. Season 4 is so very epic and it had me literally terrified for the characters on screen. HOW THINGS GO OUT OF CONTROL! The problem with this last season is that I lost about a day and a half of my life watching it. Once you start you just CANNOT stop.

The most amazing part of this entire season and the scene which particularly blew my mind was the way Gus got RID of the mexican cartel by poisoning them. It was a very bold move and truly gus is a man with balls of STEEL. His intuition for example when he realized that Walt was watching him go to his car across the street. He senses things in the air. Also when Jesse spirals down into depression after killing that chemist guy and just has tons of crazy parties and THROWS money at his local crackheads and make them fight for it. The DEPRAVITY of those scenes is so gripping and TERRIFYING. The more so TERRIFYING that you know it is based on what happens in reality.

  For instance, in episode 10 Gus, Mike, and Jesse are in Mexico speaking with the drug cartel and Gus is speaking with the kingpen of the cartel who informs Gus that he has crossed the line. It is implied from this that the cartel plans to kill Gus and they have already informed him that Jesse belongs to the cartel now and is going to have to stay in cook. The fact that the cartel was planning to kill Gus is a big deal because (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Gus knows their plan and in turn poisons the men from the cartel while poisoning himself at the same time, then goes to the restroom and vomits the poison out before it can take full effect and kill him.
  I say the above because without the subtitles you would be unaware of the fact that the cartel was plotting to kill Gus and that Gus knew this and had to kill the cartel first before he and his men were killed.
  I say save yourself the money and watch this on netflix with the subtitles to get the full story of what is going on when the cartel and Gus meet and speak in spanish. Great show but should have spent the extra money on the product to put subtitles in.",1342310400,,1790,4.085470085470085
4608929,5,B0058YPG1G,"Walter White such a likable guy:)  We have a love/hate relationship with Walter, a murder or two under the circumstances seems acceptable, well, sort of.

Walter, Jesse, Gus, the trio that made the money. Walter and Jesse cooked, and Gus led the meth to the money. These three lived under the threat of death, and in the fourth season we realize it is either Gus or Jesse and Walter. The episodes leading to the finale were tough, tense and violent. When the big bang came, it was so unexpected. It was an exquisite set-up, Walter hiding at the Senior Nursing Home, outside the the window, and the cute little white haired lady yelling hello to him.  Gus arriving with his entourage, and then leaving in that fashion. Kudos!

Skyler knows the story, and now she is implicated, big time. Walt Junior goes on trusting his dad as the best there is, and wondering what is wrong with his mother. The baby oblivious to everything.  Hank will be vindicated at the end, the lab burned down and he realized something was there. Hank alone suspected Gus. Here is a man who can't see inside his own family, but everything else seems pretty clear headed. Mike, alone in Mexico recuperating, will come home to what?

We have a series five about to start, and we are all anticipating what we will behold. Can Gilligan live up to this past season? Oh, we all think,yes. What a ride we have in front of us!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-15-12

Every episode feels like it was just 10 mins long because it goes so fast and you always want more. Most of the time I am left sitting there with my mouth hanging open or screaming ""OMG"" at the TV....hahhahha.  Am sorry this is the last season, I will really miss it. The main thing is....this show is an example of what TV can be, the acting, the writing, it's all there. It makes you wonder why more shows can't have this level of talent and it certainly sours me to alot of TV that is out there. Enjoy!!",1342224000,,707,4.086330935251799

Season four was an incredible run in the ascension of Walter White's journey from disenchanted chemistry teacher towards evil drug kingpin.

I won't rehash everything, but suffice to say that the build up to and eventual show down with gus marked a major milestone in the show.

The Bluray set includes a lot of great extra material including fantastic commentary tracks, a ton of cool extra material and some great behind the scenes footage on the making of the show.

(especially the final three episodes) just kept building.  The use of flashbacks is first-rate and does not make

the audience feel dumb for not seeing something the first time around.  I think I will actually miss Gus even

Breaking Bad: The Complete Fourth Season]]I had this on order since last October.  I found it at Fry's the day it came out on DVD.  As soon as I got home I tried to cancel my Amazon order, but for 6 hours I got a message that Amazon was not available.  Later, I was told that it was in the process of shipping.

Long story short, every set I bought was defective.  Despite a few hundred other disks playing perfectly on my Sony VDX RDR-525 for years and several others since, including ALL episodes of this set but #6, the end of episode 6 continues to be screwed-up even on the second replacement.  BTW, both the original I got from Frys and their replacement had the same problem.

Five copies bad in the same place from two sources, when many other disks play perfectly?  Sounds to me like a bad burn.  So first thing to do if you get this set is to try Disk 2 Episode 6 from about 35 minutes until the end and see if it hangs/skips or otherwise fails to play smoothly on every device you might play it on, and return it if it won't.

I'm now on the third copy from Amazon.  I returned both earlier copies the same day about 15 June using their printed labels [now 6 July] and they've credited me for the return of one copy on 3 July, but not the other, so their returns process sucks.

DO NOT buy this product from Amazon.  Get it locally.  Test it for playback on Episode 6 in the last 10 minutes, and exchange it locally, because Amazon will definitely screw over you on a return forever.

4609280,5,B0058YPG1G,"If there was ever a show to make me a TV enthusiast, Breaking Bad is it. I rarely set aside time for television shows, preferring the relatively concise artistic potential of film. But Breaking Bad has forced me to ""break"" this habit and surrender myself to its deep characters, nail-biting drama, and stunningly artistic presentation. I cannot recommend it highly enough. However, be warned: when watching this show you may at times exhibit what I like to call the ""Breaking Bad Syndrome"" -- awe-induced heart palpitations which may lead to sleep deprivation or temporary blindness (as you search the ground for your eyeballs, which just popped out of your head).

Walter White is, in my opinion, one of the greatest fictional character portrayals of all time. The transformation he undergoes across all 4 (and soon to be 5) seasons is epic, moving, and at times very dark. Television has the privilege of being able to develop its characters across many seasons and the writers of Breaking Bad take full advantage, expertly constructing Walt and his companions with the precision of a surgeon. The sub-plots of each episode are individually engrossing, but Breaking Bad always keeps its primary focus on the long-term development of its story and characters, and rightfully so. While this makes for a ""slow-burn"" at times, the payoff is always worth it, and you'll be watching through your fingers as the plot-lines and characters converge in stirring climaxes. Breaking Bad refrains from desensitizing its audience with constant action, but slowly gets under your skin so that when it hits you, it hits you hard.

What is most intriguing is the moral ambiguity shrouding the characters and their actions. The distinction between hero and villain becomes progressively blurred, making for a conflicted but engaging audience relationship with the characters. Despite this, the writers reserve a special ability to also make us sympathize with every character, even if we held hostile feelings just an episode ago. And the characters are as well acted as they are drawn. Obvious credit goes to Bryan Cranston, but he is matched at nearly every turn by his co-stars, especially Aaron Paul as his younger partner. Giancarlo Esposito also fashions a memorable and charismatic semi-villain in drug lord Gustavo Fring. The depth the actors give their characters causes the show to feel very real, despite the slight absurdity of some of the situations it presents. Breaking Bad's genius lies in this perfect balance of pop absurdity and chilling realism, which ends up leaving the viewer emotionally spent but hopelessly addicted. By tangling us up in the escalating internal conflicts of its characters, the show induces an emotional ""high"" that is irresistible. Somewhat inconceivably the show manages to form a very personal connection with the viewer, despite how far removed the story may be from our individual lives.

So what of Season 4? Personally I did not find it quite as affecting as Seasons 2 & 3 -- it didn't have quite as many of those Breaking Bad ""moments"" -- but it is still, without a doubt, 5 stars. The episodes work together as one big build towards the climax, which does not fail to deliver. To be fair, the final twist of Season 4 stretched the plot's plausibility a little too much for my taste, but I forgive a show that consistently does so many other things exceptionally well. I could go on about how beautifully it is shot, the subtle metaphors, the tragic ""American"" themes, but I'll save you the time: pick up this show and experience the phenomenon that is... Breaking Bad.",1341273600,,3603,5.011686143572621

4609319,1,B0058YPG1G,"Let me start by saying I'm an incredibly huge Breaking Bad fan and I've anxiously awaited this Blu-ray edition of the fourth season to come out.  This DVD Is the most frustrating, unexplainable stupid, illogical screw up I've ever seen in my life!  First of all I returned the first set to Amazon because it is the most difficult loading DVD I've ever experienced keeping in mind I have 800 DVDs and at least 150 Blu-ray DVDs and have never had this problem before so I assumed this set was defective.

So next Amazon replaces the defective DVDs incredibly fast (thank you Amazon) so now thinking my troubles are over I sit down to watch the Breaking Bad forth season only to find this set has the exact same problem as the previous one.  Now I'm left with the two choices either try to get this set to work somehow or return it and have absolutely nothing!  I decided to try to get this to work I can't even explain what I had to go through as far as starting, stopping, opening, closing the DVD player and after about 10 minutes you're able to get it to play but you have to go through this every single time you change anything on this DVD set.

With the fifth season of breaking bad a little over two weeks away I'm trying desperately to watch the fourth season and get caught up and I thought the loading problem would be something I could live with but little did I know that is only where the problems begin!

This is a little minor thing but nevertheless incredibly irritating on these three DVDs every single episode is listed on every DVD menu so you do not know which episodes are on  which DVD, so you're always given the option to pick which episode you want to watch only to find out they tell you to get up and change disk..  I for one have never seen a menu situation like this usually 100% of the time the episodes on that disc are the only things listed on that disk.

So now you have to get up go make an unexpected disk change only to have to go through the incredible process of getting the next disc to load.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume my three blu ray DVD players are the only ones that are going to have this loading problem, but here is a problem that there's no way you can escape and it's hard to freakin imagine why they would even do this!  For you Breaking Bad fans out there you realized there's key conversations that go on totally in Spanish so if you can believe this, ""they do not have the closed captioning on the screen for those conversations"" so if you don't speak Spanish this is somewhat of a problem!

Get a load of this,  it gets worse,  not only did they leave the close captioning off of two incredibly long important conversations but later on in a far less critical conversation they DO have the close captioning, this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever!

I have not tried this and don't intend to with the loading issues on this DVD set, I assume I could go in the menu and turn on closed captioning for just those conversations and then turn it off but then having to go through the loading process again no way!

I have all three seasons on regular DVD and I have also purchased the first three seasons on Blu-ray and I have not had this type problem with any of those sets, why all of a sudden they decided to just totally screw this thing up is totally amazing to me, the person or persons responsible for this colossal screwup must be fired at once!

I'm now going to return this second set and order the regular DVD version, do you think there is anyway they could have screwed that one up too?",1340841600,10,3583,4.282962962962963
4609320,4,B0058YPG1G,"I loved the first three seasons of ""Breaking Bad"". I know of no other show where you see the main character's motivations evolve in real time. The attention to the nuts and bolts of running an illicit business and the ramifications thereof may be boring for some, but for me it's what sets this show apart from all other crime dramas. The actors and writers deserve every award they've earned for this show.

That being said, this season was not my favorite because it seemed to trend towards sensationalism (first with Gus' revenge plot on the cartel, then the poisoning of the boy, then with the final, unbelievable special effects shot of Gus at the hospital, which looked like it was inspired by the movie ""The Quick And The Dead""), which tells me that the writers may be running out of steam.

Overall, season 4 was still quite entertaining (Aaron Paul's best) and worth seeing again, and aside from a few loose ends, season 5 will pretty much start with a clean slate, so it will be interesting to see where they take the show.

Like I said before though, as much as I love ""Breaking Bad,"" I hope they have the strength to pull the plug before the series takes a major tailspin.",1340755200,,1184,4.5233644859813085

4609322,5,B0058YPG1G,"It's wrong to review just one season of this show when it's the previous build-up that makes this season so great. Every nerve-wracking scenario you can think of (and not) comes to a head in these episodes. Secondary characters begin to play a major part and, in light of Walt's increasing loss of control, they almost outshine the main character's genius. I won't repeat what others have rightly said about the complexity of the plot and character development - every compliment is deserved.

I would, however, like to add that the soundtrack is incredible. Not only the music provided by Dave Porter is eerie and unnerving (particularly at the end of ""Crawl Space""), but also the ""random"" mix of old and newer hits give Breaking Bad that cherry on top. In truth, nothing is random about the songs - I downloaded a lot of them (lists of songs used in respective episodes are available online, as the official soundtrack only contains some songs from seasons 1 & 2). I was astounded how well the lyrics often fit to the story unfolding; you'd think they were written specifically for BB, the way ""Negro Y Azul"" was. Examples include ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"" by Gnarls Barkley or ""Catch Yer Own Train"" by The Silver Seas, though Ana Tijoux, Holy F*** and the many reggae greats make it such an all-rounder that I watch for the plot as much as for the new musical inspiration. (the songs I refer to are not just from season 4)
An absolute A+++ show! And totally re-watchable - I've gotten several people hooked and watch along with them whenever possible. It has yet to be dull!",1340582400,,1578,4.635714285714286

4609324,3,B0058YPG1G,"This is hands down the best show on tv. Great acting. Great writing. Great stories. The only problem with this set is that for some reason they decided not to burn in the subtitles when people are speaking Spanish. So any time a conversation begins in Spanish you have to grab the remote, hit rewind, then turn the English subtitles on. If you leave it on all the time you get English subtitles for all of the English that is spoken throughout the show rather than just the foreign language.  There is no foreign language only subtitle track, just a complete subtitle track and another complete subtitle track that adds descriptive information for the hearing impared. It's pretty ridiculous, and an obvious mistake. This season has a lot of Spanish in it, so it is a bit of a hassle. I honestly can't remember any other show or movie having this issue since the early days of DVD, let alone on a Blu-ray. So it's a pretty crazy screw up on their part. It is possible that this is just an issue on the Playstation 3 I use for blurays (don't have another player to test it on), but as that is just about the most popular player in the world it's not an acceptable problem.

After an Internet search I found that it isn't an issue just for the PS3. There is a fix (but really, should we need to have to fix something like this?). After you start watching the show pull up the menu while the show is playing. Go to subtitles and turn on the English subtitles - not the English SDH subtitles. Then exit from the menu to the already playing show. Then pull up the menu AGAIN, go to subtitles, then choose no subtitles. Then you can exit the menu and only the foreign languages will be subtitled. This will have to be done any time you change discs.",1340496000,13,1743,4.36

We find out that Brock was poisened by Lily of Valley, not Ricin. The last screen shot is of a Lily of the Valley plant on the deck at Walt's house.  What did happen to the Ricin cigarette Jesse had, where is it?

Walter White's character is shocking and compelling. You can't imagine becoming a ruthless meth dealer but he slowly brings you into his competing madness of being too proud and having no shame. Pinkman's character is equally compelling with a clear need for fatherly approval and a desire to gain some respect from his high school chemistry teacher. The complex characters make this story line interesting and raises the question for all of us of ""how far would you be willing to go?"" The answer is a slippery slope!",1339891200,2,731,4.496240601503759
4609366,5,B0058YPG1G,"My addiction to this series is no different from the addiction of the methamphetamine users who are the consumers that main character Walter White supplies.
Take a lifelong nerdy high school chemistry teacher, make him go off the deep end when he is given two years to live, throw every crazy unimaginable problem someone who cooks meth can have at him and you have something so suspensefull you can't tear your eyes away.

Lead actor Bryan Cranston's wrinkled face and perpetually horror stricken expression supplies the backdrop to some truely gruesome yet fascinating situations.  This character wallows in deception and immorality, lying continually to those he loves, never giving a moments thought to what he is actually doing to contribute to the misery of the addicts he is supplying.  Any thoughts of right and wrong are strangely lacking in this man.  And yet, his friends and family continue to see him as a good and decent fellow.  His wife finally must accept that he is a constant liar and up to no good but gets sucked into his greed.

All the acting is great in this.  From Walter's wife Skylar, who starts out as naive and moral and quickly succumbs to join her husband in his persuit of money, to DEA agent Hank, who although good at his job is obnoxious consistently in his forced, crude insulting humor, to his wife Marie who has amusing episodes of kleptomania, each character is fleshed out and interesting. Sleazy shyster Saul Goodman (s'all good man) provides comic relief.
Son Walt Jr. provides the one character that remains pure, in contrast to his parents.

Never have I seen anything that threw at the characters so many horrific dangerous situations simultaneously.  Danger comes at Walter from every possible place.  His life
becomes a juggling act of lies, violence, drug cartel murderers, and greed.  While it was baffling to see this lifelong good guy turn into such a cold violent monster so easily,
it was fun to see him squeek by continually as he walked the criminal tightrope between life, prison, and death.

There were lots of glaring instances of ridiculous improbability at the end of the last episode which unfortunately I can't reveal here or it would spoil it for people who haven't yet seen it.  These instances were disappointing to me, as up until then this show had been pretty believable, without too many loose ends.  One concerns reporting to work at a drug lab in plain view of lots and lots of people and not expecting to get caught as well as leaving your car parked in front of it every day.

Season Five begins next month.  Hopefully you will be caught up with all the Season Four episodes by then because each episode is a continuation of the last.
As for me, I can't wait to see where this picks up.  Will Walter continue his drug making?
How will he get it sold?  What will happen to his partner?

This is the best TV dramatic serial of all time in my opinion.",1339804800,4,2921,4.692156862745098

4609432,4,B0058YPG1G,"It's fairly typical to say each season after the first of ""Breaking Bad"" was a game changer but, in this case, the fourth season IS.

Blu-ray review (although the contents for the DVD are very much like that for the Blu-ray, they aren't exactly the same). I'd give the season 5 stars but the BD itself 4 because of some transfer issues.

SPOILERS:

After the cold blooded murder of Gale  (who Gus had hired to eventually replace Walt and Jessie) the unlikely dynamic duo found themselves once again in demand from an increasingly unhappy Gus who STILL had plans to replace them at some point. The murder of Gus pushes Jessie into a dark place he's been before but never quite so deep. Skylar decides that she and Walt must have a way to funnel the massive amount of money he is making and decides to invest in a business.

Walt must find a way to get Jessie back knowing that he NEEDS him in particular to eventually put Gus out of the way. He also realizes that as long as Gus can get access to Jessie he man not need Walt any longer and that will put Walt, Skylar and his son in harm's way as well.

Gus makes Jessie feel important and takes him in one of the stunning set pieces of the season to the home of a drug kingpin in Mexico where Gus has plans for ultimately eliminating his competition not realizing that Walt has similiar plans of his own.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Breaking Bad"" continues to be one of the best written shows on television and that's saying quite a bit given some of the competition out there both on AMC and other networks. Creator/producer/writer Vince Gilligan continues to craft a dark, compelling TV series. This isn't ""lite"" entertainment by any stretch of the imagination and those looking for something that will entertain without asking difficult questions and taking characters we like and sometimes admire down the road of temptation should look elsewhere.

While the Blu-ray doesn't look as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good. There are issues with banding that occur and are particularly noticeable in just about every episode. Most of the previous seasons didn't have this issue that I recall (I'll have to take a look at them again to confirm it)which is why it's perplexing that it's a problem here.

The 5.1 lossless DTS audio sounds quite nice with good use of directional effects present throughout. Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish for the Blu-ray.

The special features are quite nice on this set including videopod casts, commentary tracks (13!) on every episode that are usually quite informative. We also get extended and alternate scenes as well as the ""Inside Breaking Bad"" featurettes. We also get ""Better Call Saul"" commercials from the series, an amusing gag reel and a variety of featurettes on the production of the series. We also get ""uncensored"" versions of episode as well as an extended final episode for the fourth season.

The fourth season brings us to the brink with Walt's final descent into the madness of the world he's adopted and the final shot of the episode demonstrates how desperate he is and how that madness consumes him, Jessie and everyone he comes into contact with.

Highly recommended.",1339286400,6,3200,4.71326164874552

It's so riveting that it causes ""users"" to lose inordinate amounts of sleep. I literally sit up on my couch and sometimes just crouch there because I am actually on the edge of my seat (this is not a figure of speech in this scenario).

To get to my point about Season 4 now: I have been streaming the first few episodes on Amazon Instant Video on my PS3. The only problem is that my bandwidth is not fast enough to stream seamlessly. Does that stop me? NO. I sit there and agonize through the all-too-frequent pauses just to grasp another nugget of this gold mine of a drama. The acting is sublime. The story is phenomenal. And the cinematography is stellar. I made it through 5 episodes on the crappy streaming, but guess what...TODAY IS MY LUCKY DAY!!! It is out on DVD now.

4609641,5,B0058YPG1G,"This series is really great. The performance by the actors, the writers, the cinematography, the characters they all fit together perfectly and complement each other. This season things get much more intense as Walter finds out the more he gets into this world of organized crime, drug peddling, extortion, and other things that represent the underbelly of society the more danger seems to follow him. Walter walks a very fine line knowing that his amazing talents will be helpful for his employer/enemies but at the same time constantly look over his shoulder for the next approaching threat. In this season Walter White also aims too settle the score with old adversaries and move on with his life with his family and also to deal with the new conflicts that are gradually approaching. The acting is one of the many great things that makes this show so good.

Bryan Lee Cranston (Walter White) and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) are both amazing and have a great chemistry between them. Also Anna Gunn (Skyler White) Dean Norris (Hank the DEA agent) are also amazing in the series and also Gus (Esposito) is an excellent main villain of this season. Also one of the most believable and relatable characters in the show Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) actually does have a minor case of CP which causes difficulty in motor skills. What also helps create the very realistic and gridy environment of the series is the set design. The music is like the premise of the show is very dark, and sometimes, humerous, corky, and vigorous.

Overall this is a very good show and its on a very respectable network, AMC. Check it out if you like crime, drama, suspense, or your just looking for an above average T.V. series that is a departure from your usually regurgitated and generic programs.",1336953600,,1770,4.781045751633987

 I watch A LOT of TV (including Seasons 1-4 at least 5 times each) and I have to say the last 3 episodes of Season 4 count among the most riveting television I have ever witnessed in my life (okay, well I guess just a little hyperbole is thrown in here).

I will spare you all the lauding of the performances down even to Good ol' Saul's secretary.  They're all phenominal.

GET SEASON 4 Like YESTERDAY.

And AMC PLEASE DON'T END BB after 1 more 16 episode run - people are just really starting to catch on to how great BB.  If the final season ratings are huge do we get to keep it?  Pretty Please With Meth On Top?",1333497600,,858,4.089820359281437
4609928,5,B0058YPG1G,"I've been watching Breaking Bad since it first aired, and while it took a while for it to reach this point, I can honestly say that season 4 was when this show became, quite possibly, the greatest TV show on air.

Allow me to explain. Breaking bad's writers have always been great in crafting episodes. The pre-credits scenes, the dialogue, the character building, the intense feeling of dread and hopelessness at points, and watching a mild mannered high school chemistry teacher slowly turn into a drug kingpin, all make for great television. Butthis season took it to a new plateau.

By introducing Gus Fring as the antagonist to Walter White (loosely speaking of course, because the very idea of antagonists and protagonists has absolutely no meaning on this show), breaking Bad managed to create a thrilling cat and mouse game. By the end I was not sure who to root for, which really goes to show how well the writers planned this season.

I'm a big fan of The Wire, Sopranos, and Deadwood, but I now believe Breaking Bad to be better than those. My personal opinion of course, but I felt the characters on breaking Bad are more realistic, and react to situations as normal people would. It felt so strange for me to watch the pilot again after having finished the fourth season. So much has changed. And for the better.

This show is how modern crime drama/thrillers need to be done. The writers balance action and characters flawlessly to make compelling TV. Can not wait for Season 5, which I hear is the final one.",1333411200,2,1523,4.6716417910447765

I am an absolute huge admirer of American Cinema and American TV shows as i feel you produce the best shows and movies in the universe. Let me start off by saying i have seen and own many DVD series boxsets and my favourite shows of all time are 'The sopranos' and 'Dexter'.

  Well now i have finished all 4 seasons of breaking bad, you can add that to the list now. What an astonishing and breathtaking TV show this is. I don't think i have known a TV show to get stronger and stronger as each season progressed. Personally i would say season 4 is up there with the best of Breaking bad which is a hard thing to achieve considering all the other seasons were just as fantastic.

  The reason season 4 for me was the greatest was purely because it took a much darker turn and i felt the episodes resembled an even darker theme to the previous other seasons. The character of Gus played superbly by Giancarlo Esposito took an even more sinister turn in this season and i felt the producers of the show gave us an even better insight into this truely mesmerising character. I feel Breaking bad has not got the recognition it deserves over here in the Uk as it's not been advertised well. I find this aggrivating because people over here are missing out on possibly one of the greatest TV shows ever made. 5*s for breaking bad season 4, another 5*'s for Breaking Bad in general, Peace",1333065600,,1468,4.358974358974359

Every single character is cast perfectly. You have to love every one of them....and just when you think you know whats going to happen next? It turns completely around on you and goes into subplots and detours and flash-aheads which they catch up to and explain in the coming episodes. This Gilligan is one amazing writer!!!..and every actor you totally buy into.

When we heard about the show and were told that it is a High School Chemistry teacher down on his luck who begins to make the drug meth, we thought the person suggesting this show as a must watch had to be out of his mind.  We were wrong.

Complain in the right place - if you would like proper feedback and/or help. Second this program is called Breaking BAD - not getting better, or learning my lesson and not being BAD any more. Third, Walter White (ironic name, yes?) is getting badder by the moment! I cannot wait to see the final season of this amazing journey down the rabbit hole. Fourth, how can a person interpret any of this program as pro-meth smoking? The depiction of Jesse and friends and others that partook of the blue crystal was nothing short of horrific - there was no romantic under-current. Take this show for what it promised to us all. White falls from grace and with him he ""takes"" a wife that thinks - like her husband - she is smarter than those around her and a damaged self-loathing and lost young man.

You can't help but indentify with Walt, but then you find yourself feeling emotional turmoil because you stop feeling sorry for him as you see and come to grips that there is something else inside of him and you realize that you never really knew him at all. Not to worry, because Gustavo Fring (aka Chicken Man) takes bad guy to a whole another level! ""There is crime and there is Crime!"" And there are criminals and then there are Criminals!

You must watch the series from the very beginning to understand it.  It starts with a high school chemistry teacher who gets cancer, gets laid off from work, and needs a way to ensure his family is taken care of when he passes away.  He hooks up with a ""bad seed"" sort of student and they go into the meth business together.  Being a chemistry teacher affords the main character the opportunity to make the best meth out.  This creates enemies from other drug organizations, business opportunities, and heat from the feds.  It's been on of the most interesting series I've seen in a while.

Such addiction to a tale of the ""substance of addiction.""
The writing is an amazing twisted success - I was constantly caught off-guard by the trail of the tale -
The acting is superb, understated - semi-nerdy ""Hank"" just isn't the guy one sees leading a life of high-end crime; his gorgeous, greedy wife, on the brink of final divorce, is more than happy to follow a trail of millions instead; his teenage son, with MS, is just trying to grow up 'normal'; his macho DEA brother-in-law grinds away at an investigation he has no idea leads to his own family; the mad-cap, price-gouging ""criminal"" attorney provides a ton of comic relief against this family back-drop for the emergent local Cartel Master-Mind, whose arsenal is replete with stand-up henchman, mutilations, cartel murders and maneuverings. And Hank's young partner, whose plights of drug-addiction, lost love and devotion to Hank tie a power-ribbon of tension, love and frustration around the entire jewel of a series (all 4 seasons) is irresistably appealing!

First it was Season 1.  Then, Season 2.  Then Season 3.  Then, uh-oh, Season 4 is nowhere to be found on DVD.  My wife and I felt withdrawals as strong as those looking for their next ""fix"".  What to do?  Enter Amazon's streaming service for Season 4.  I couldn't get my credit card out fast enough to get our next fix of this fantastic show.  We weren't disappointed and gladly paid the $20 streaming fee.

Now, it's true that streaming isn't as convenient as the way we were used to watching BB.  But, after hooking up the laptop to our HDTV, we settled in and began our Season 4 adventure.  This is one of the few series that actually get better with each season.  And, Season 4 was no exception.

If you like roller coaster rides then you will love this series, it will take you up, down, to the edge of your seat, white knuckled, cheering, and your heart racing!

Probobaly the thing I liked best about this series was taking an ordinary man, and putting him in a situation where he felt he had to make difficult choices for, what he thought, was the good of his family. Instead he is thrown into a world he knows nothing about and where mistakes can mean death. He starts to unravel some of what it takes to survive in the brutal, ruthless world he has entered into and he realizes just how big a mistake his original decision was.

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone other than to say that the story does end so you do have closure instead of being brought to the edge only to find out the series has been cancelled. I've had this happen so many times on shows, I felt, were excellent and had great potential like; Heroes, Journey man, John Doe, Stargate Universe, Farscape (although they did finally make a movie), Firefly, etc., etc.

To me, it is disrespectful to the viewers who have stuck by and they deserve closure by allowing a few more runs just to allow an end to be made. If anything, they could make digital only releases for fans to buy at Amazon or other pay to view site.

I really did enjoy this series and hated that it ended but was so glad that it did end and didn't leave me never knowing what happened next.

Warning: The series is about drugs, the cartel, and so has some graphic violence and language. There is also nudity but it is what you would see in this dark world and nothing more.

After marathoning three seasons in two weeks, I was able to watch season 4 unfold slowly, as Breaking Bad is want to do, and I see its genius even more clearly. Vince Gilligan has taken a page from David Simon's book and limited his writing team to less than ten people, allowing him to impose his unique vision more clearly, and the results lurk beneath the surface of the whole season in the paranoid Walter's slow-burning rivalry with Gus before exploding in the final episodes with the jaw-dropping consequences of Mr. White's continued decision to ""break bad"". Jesse takes an awesomely dark turn in character, Gus makes a smooth transition from Walter's partner to his mortal enemy, bed-ridden Hank gets crazier than usual, and Skylar becomes even more involved in Walt's business. All in all, season 4 continues the trend of each season of Breaking Bad raising the bar in terms of jaw-dropping moments, superb writing, fascinating character development, and some of the best acting ever from Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Jonathan Banks, and the colorful cast of the ever-expanding look at the Mexican side of the Meth trade.

4610215,3,B0058YPG1G,"So, I've seen all of the episodes of Breaking Bad up to this point and am a little confused. While it has good acting, there are some things that have been troubling me. First off, Walt has become an unlikeable character at this point. What was once a man who was all in it for 'fam' has now become this egotistical prick. I'm not gonna lie, I was actually rooting for Gus this season. How do the writers let that happen? Aren't you supposed to maintain some shred of sentiment towards the main character so that the viewers want to root for the protagonist and keep watching? And God, if they show one more scene of him walking away from a pending explosion I'm going to explode! They did that in the first season, so why recycle it in the 4th? I was so hoping he'd just die already. Though, I'm pretty sure that's coming soon. My main issue was after Walt has been so cautious about not being caught with Jesse. He not only shows up at the hospital and vocally makes himself noticed in front of the cops, but he also brings a bomb in with him! Uhhhh, so I guess it's safe to say that next season the cops will somehow mention this to Dean and he will get access to the hospital tapes and see his brother-in-law: live and in living color! Also, I don't understand why Jesse has lived this long. You mean to tell me that Walt has been able to geuss all and I do mean ALL of Gus's plans to undermine him but he couldn't lose this perpetual screw up? Jesse is the biggest testament to Walt's weakness. And while we are all humans who have our own weaknesses, this is uncharactersitic for a man who takes all these precautions to keep his 'other' life hidden. Jesse has always been a liability. From the first season of him revealing Walt's info to Krazy-8 to several other acts of semi-retardedness he's committed (hydrochloric acid in tub incident, drained battery, talking Tuco out of takiing the poison, etc) and trust me I do mean et cetera. Why is Walt so devoted to him? And don't say it was answered already because the answer he gave Gus is not backed up by the plot. When Gus posed the question to Walt I was actually on the edge of my seat and not because of the acting but because I really wanted to know, too. Having access to all of the information as audience members and still not being able to grasp the answer to that question beforehand is a poor storyline.  I understand that now they have been through so much they've become emotionally invested in each other but what I'm saying is that it should have never gotten to that point. Jesse has been more of a roadblock than endearing. He was an idiot almost the whole 2nd and 3rd season. There is no question about his stupidity in the first season. BUT NOW I GET IT! They have used Jesse as a writing crutch to spare the life of Walt and vise versa for the 4th season. Crutches have become a sort of visual symbol throughout this season with Walt, Jr., Dean, and now the actual plot! Well I'm growing tired of these crutches and can't wait for them to turn on each other. That is the only way this show will interest me again for season 5. It was the shows comparison to The Wire that brought me here. Now, the disappointing realization that it crumbles in comaprison is making me leave.",1326931200,2,3253,4.332786885245902

4610217,5,B0058YPG1G,"I started watching season 1 with some apprehension.
I found the subject matter vaguely unappealing, as I did the main characters.  However, the show had come  highly recommended by a reliable source and I persevered.  Still, I wasn't absolutely sold after the first season, despite admitting readily that the writing and story line were innovative and unpredictable and the direction and camera work stunning.

More than 2 years later I caught up with the second, third and fourth seasons, again having been advised by my friend not to miss out.  However this time I fell right into it and gobbled up the entire fare in the shortest possible time.  WOW!  Even my wife, who normally refuses point blank to watch films with too much violence, was completely mesmerized.

Without hesitation or exception, I now consider Breaking Bad one of the VERY BEST shows that TV has to offer and what is more, that I have ever seen.

WHY?
Because it satisfies deeply and intelligently on just about all levels.  The writing, camera work, editing, the total freshness and unpredictability of events to come, its innate intelligence, AND, above all, the outstanding humor (if deliciously black).  And there there's the totally remarkable and utterly believable acting from all concerned.  For fear of omission, I'd rather not mention any names, as all of the main characters' performances are beautifully crafted and superbly executed.

Well done to you all!  I really hope and trust that the people responsible for the creation of this amazing series, have received the praise that they deserve.  If not, that some of them may read this accolade",1326844800,2,1630,5.007434944237918

4610273,5,B0058YPG1G,"I was sad after The Wire ended it's run. I was convinced that no television program would ever match it's quality.

I was wrong.

Breaking Bad is everything one could hope for in a pitch perfect television show. The acting, directing, cinematography, writing, all bundled in an amazing package that seems to get better each year. Midway through season 4, I was slightly disappointed with the slow pace, but then I was reminded about it's deliberate nature. This show builds suspense like nothing I've ever seen, shifting gears midway through the season, and never letting up after. The writing is undeniably superb, from simple dialogue to large story arcs and cliff hangers, everything feels right and not forced. There is no important plot element undiscovered, no loose ends left untied, no one dimensional extra characters or scenes that do not serve a purpose of moving the story along.

Acting, especially from the leads, is Oscar worthy to say the least. Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito definitely deserve all the praise they get, but Bryan Cranston's work here is incredible and unforgettable. It's one of those performances that will stay etched into your memory. He's just as good, if not better, during quiet, subtle scenes as he is when he puts on his crazy, delusional and genius Heisenberg persona.

Don't get me started on the film making: vast, beautiful landscapes serve as backdrops to some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There are no wasted frames in Breaking Bad, it uses light and color elegantly to balance the mood and tension in each scene, there are plenty of long continuous takes for maximum immersion, with each season taking on it's own identity in terms of it's style in film making.

I'd like to thank Vince Gilligan for giving us this show and everyone else involved as well. Although I'm sad about Season 5 being the last one, part of me is glad that there is an ending planned, I have no doubt it will be incredible.",1326067200,42,1964,4.833333333333333
4610274,5,B0058YPG1G,"Salut is in my opinion the best episode of Breaking Bad Season 4.  It is defined by the suspense and climax of Gustavo's revenge story, which occurs at the end of Salut.  As much we all hate Gus, because he is a ruthless thug hiding behind politeness and good demeanor, one finds oneself sympathizing for him when Episode 8 tells the story of Los Pollos Hermanos.  From Episode 8 on, Gus' direction and motivations become somewhat clearer, and his revenge becomes a story within the story.  Of course, he travels to Mexico with Mike and Jesse under the ruse of caving in to the cartel's demands.  But the the episode does not reveal this until the end, and it keeps the viewer in suspense throughout, wondering how Gus would use the celebratory gift to exact his revenge.  As the climax is reached, Gus does something that he rarely does in seasons 3 and 4:  He shouts.  Like a general in a war, he shouts, ""Don Eladio is dead!  His capos are dead!  Fill your pockets and leave in peace, or fight me and die!""",1325980800,,1009,4.434782608695652

Additionally, we get to see Gus in his younger years and how he came to hate the drug overlord in Mexico. Hank continues to follow the bread crumb trail (even though seriously injured in the finale of the last season) and seems to be getting closer at times. The flashbacks were some of the best parts of this season. The other part was of course the ongoing ""chess game"" between Walt and Gus, especially when Jesse was manipulated.

It's a roller coaster ride that you should want to be on.

The whole thing unfolds like a Greek Tragedy, and the main character, Walter White, relies on what he perceives as logic and rationale only to slip deeper down a rabbit hole that he can't seem to escape from.

While there are some minor hiccups or problems within the storyline, the viewer gets so immersed into the dynamics between the characters, particularly between Walter White and Jessie Pinkman, that the storyline's integrity becomes less important than the internal struggles of the characters themselves.  The arc of the story is a train wreck unfolding before the viewer's eyes - you know this has to end and it's not going to end well, so the focus is shifted to introspection as demonstrated with the back stories.

His ability to rationalize moral questions in order to justify what he does makes us uneasy.  But what makes us uneasy is the very fact that we begin to relate to Walter and we realize that the seed of Walter is in all of us and we have to say, ""but for the grace of God, there go I.""

I have had to stop watching some of those shows because of the glaring believability problem I now have after watching BB for four seasons.

If anything, season four was even better than 1-3, which is hard to imagine.  The writing is absolutely superb episode after episode, surpassed only by the acting of every single actor doing every single character. There is no one who does not do a magnificent acting job in this series.  Even so, one must single out Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as inhabiting a different universe in the acting world from their contemporaries.  Heck, these guys make the actors doing criminal law FILMS seem inferior.

I could write a book about this season but instead I am just going to give a few highlights as I don't want to wreck the wonderful watching experience in store for you. The biggest problem at the core of season four is that Walt and Jesse are in terrible danger of being killed by Gus. Gus and Walt especially view one another as intractable enemies and each realizes that one must kill the other in order to survive.  Esposito does a fantastic job as Gus, a criminal who makes more effort than most to lead a seemingly normal life but also is infinitely more evil and corrupt than most.  He comes across initially to those who meet him about as threatening as your average CPA.  That he runs a drive through chicken franchise empire as his front is downright hilarious.  The DEA, except for Hank, buys this masquerade too, hook, line and sinker.

Hank comes into his own this season initially as a pathetic cripple who won't do anything but buy rocks on ebay to restore his life to some semblance of what he once had.  As he notices Gus more and more though, he begins to come back to life.  The two sisters, one his wife and the other Walt's are their own sources of vexation to Walt and Hank and most others.  Hank's Marie starts stealing again but at real estate open houses (this sequence is brilliant) and Skyler's former boss's problems with the IRS are now her problems too since she cooked the books for him.

Jesse is the weak link keeping all of these lives hanging by a string.  First he comes apart as we open the season and he has killed to keep Walt alive.  Then he is restored by Gus and his henchman Mike to be Gus's tool towards destroying Walt. Jesse doesn't know this.  He thinks they have come to find his talents valuable instead.  Jesse resists Gus but he is fragile.  His personality is at odds on almost every level whereas Walt is a heat seeking missile in comparison to Jesse. He just wants to consume with fire everyone who has ever made his life a misery.  He rarely even thinks about his cancer any more as these other events have so overtaken him.

I better shut up now and hope that you get the show ASAP and have the time of your life.

Has great characters: real people with rich, complex personalities, not the simple minded canned characters you typically see in other shows. The BB characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors, they do such a wonderful job. It also has intelligent, creative plots, and you just can't tell where its going from episode to episode.

The range of emotions he is able to convey while maintaining a deadpan exterior facade of calm and normalcy is absolutely amazing.

She kinda walked away from Walter after Walt told him about the drug business and cheated on Walter and later filed divorce, because she donot want to use the money earned from drug business. Her attitude to Walt changed dramatically. BUT why did not she change back her attitude after she joined the business too? I think she own Walt an apology.",1320105600,,587,4.4953271028037385
4610448,5,B0058YPG1G,"The multi-award winning Breaking Bad has recently concluded it's fourth season with a final and fifth season being officially announced, and having finished the 13 ep block in a viewing marathon over the last 4 days, I have to say it holds onto it's title as one of the THE best dramas on TV, period.

Season 1 starts off a little slow introducing our main character, Walter White, but then the story takes off with a literal BANG (you know the episode) and viewers find themselves suddenly on a nonstop roller coaster ride thru seasons 2 and 3 with ever increasing pace and tension.

Backed up by one of the strongest supporting casts with hardly a weak link between them, Bryan Cranston once again gives a tour de force performance as Mr White.  We see his gradual transformation from a Ned Flanders-like wimp to a hardened, rage-filled villain that would do Machievelli proud throughout the last 3 seasons, but things come to an explosive (pun intended) conclusion with the wrap of season 4.

Now this is the way to portray a 'good man's descent into villainy' story.  Yeah lookin at YOU Darth Vader & George Lucas.

In addition to Cranston's 3-time Emmy winning performance, other standouts include Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, brillaint character actor Jonathan Banks and Bob Odenkirk constant scene-stealer as Saul Goodman.  This rich cast of supporting characters give life to the well written story that constantly ramps the feeling of tension, danger and dread as we see Walt continue to spiral in a direction that will lead to an inevitable end.

If you haven't started watching this series and enjoy crime drams like the Sopranos, Wire, The Shield, then this is a much watch.  It easily matches if not exceeds all of these shows and has earned a permanent place in TV history.",1320019200,12,1791,4.826797385620915

It's a beautiful combination of the Sopranos, Tarantino, and Twin Peaks - freaky, funny, ironic, synchronistic-inter-related plot, violent, qwerky, showing the very human dark side of fear, greed, addiction, control, and ultimatums of human existence - life and death, interwoven with Love, family, Loyalty and Friendship. Extraordinary acting and directing brilliance that brings back the art of the cliff-hanger. I love this show because each episode resets ""The new normal"" for characters and story - ""how can this get any worse? No! Don't go there! Damn you went there??""

4610545,4,B0058YPG1G,"Breaking Bad is one of, if not the best T.V. series ever produced, in my opinion.
From story, location and top notch actors made breaking bad the success it is today.
I found it hard to watch anything else after the very first episode of Breaking Bad.

The New Mexico setting with all the exterior shots made it life like. A brilliant story line that will be plagiarized for a long time to come.

The choice for actors couldn't have been better. I love the way Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) characters have a protagonist antagonist ark within the story line. Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) was perfect for this part and played it to perfection, great choice. All the actors were brilliant and are the perfect choices for this production. Give the Casting Director a raise.

I only started watching Breaking Bad on Netflix last month and got hooked immediately. I watched all three seasons in a month. I couldn't wait and had to buy the 4th season from Amazon.

I told my 17 year old son about it and one day a few days later at his friend's house they were scrolling through Netflix for something to watch and spotted Breaking Bad He told them that his father said that Breaking Bad was really good, so they gave it a try and they got hooked, then it spread through school like wild fire.

Simply put, Breaking Bad is just great fun. Thanks to all who made this one and

4610561,5,B0058YPG1G,"This is a story about a guy who thought he could 'just' use his skills and cook a little speed and leave money for his family..This idea occurred as he was suddenly told he was dying soon, of terminal lung cancer, at about 45 years old. He got screwed financially -by his old pals-in a chemist patent (or something close to a patent). As a result, he is financially strapped  works as Cranston is now a high-school chemistry-teacher, his salary- 40k.
While he is living the low-budget life, the fake friends who just forgot him, are really livin large. They do insist that he come to their big parties, why I don't know.  And now,- when Cranston's wife spilled his terminal secret, they want to help him -now that he is dying. Make amends suddenly. He is not havin it.
Why people watch this is because it got beyond complicated. Cranston had to go over to the selling side of this drug-world hell when his young high-school student messed up the sales part of their partnership.  That is when it turned into a terrorizing sort of horror flick. (I don't like scary movies with ghosts etc..but this, is different, way different)
When Cranston has to man-up, you see a transformation that is mind-blowing. He OWNS the worst Mexican Cartel thugs that are about to kill him. We watch them decide to try. I believe these guys could be real. No, the USA is not talkin about Mexican cartel. But they are here. One of the scenes, a head on a skateboard is based on a true practice done commonly in Mexico. One of the more famous killers for the one of the real Cartels often decapitates and sends souvenirs around.  I no longer want to move closer to the border-out of the worst ozone where seasons are milder. I think I will stay in the cold north country. Even though no one is safe, not even in Vermont.
The whirlpool of events gives a believable picture of what drug dealing really is. See what is past the street corners and you go over to the wholesale side. It does not matter what role, in this world, that some person might think would be 'safe' to make a bit of fast cash. Thoughtful planning, great strategies- just don't pan out. Sleazy lawyers with brand new tricks fall flat. Seems everything fails. Clearly anyone involved, or just in the vicinity, can be killed--just to serve as a 'message' from competitors. Sure we have seen the 'let this massacre be a message to others, who would try to betray us' - this type of drug story has been told before.
Definitely its Cranston AND Aaron Paul, his right arm, that makes this into a sort of psycho-drama, along with too many others to mention. Aaron can not be denied as the  crazy, street smart right arm of the gritty Cranston, whose life is like a runaway train ready to fly off the tracks.
Its not /just/ violence-its a compelling story. Its too real to deny. In each episode I expect Walt to be killed, or someone around him killed. Close calls are all over the place. Oh yes, people die or get mangled real bad. You never know who is left, at the end of any episode.
I think the drug-sellin+ usin-life-- is presented intensely well here. Intensely well. Cranston started out thinkin he had a month or two to live. He thought that he would get a little money to leave to his sharp-cookie/cool wife, AND his brilliant kid with some special needs, AND even enough for the future of their suprise baby who arrived mid-life, truly not planned. Seemed to be a lot to do, but he got there pretty fast, and all seemed posed to end well.
Its a bizarre, wrenching mess that sort of turns into blackmail. If Cranston does not continue to produce-dot dot dot. His wife is not dumb. Cranston tried to keep his dealin sidejob secret from her. And eventually she gets siderailed as well, while he is 'out walking' too many hours, too many nites. She pushes to get him to open up to her, he pulls back and avoids the truth about where he 'goes.'
He argues that he does have cancer, why should he not be allowed to just take a 'walk' when he must...  She is just not diggin it.
Meanwhile, he learns to become at least as crazy acting- as the heavies who threaten him. The trained killers stir him to stand up, -face them down. Just a thrilling transformation of character. In my worst nightmrares.
""Walt's"" stunning need to leave money for his family after he passes is hard to imagine. Where he gets this drive, to survive, while living with with terminal lung cancer.. As he sometimes chokes for air. He gets knocked down on the ground, kicked in the chest over and over, left in the dust choking.
still it goes forward, week by week.  Its twistingly realistic, truly sick, and it stays real, ugly just like ugly reality.
Its a brutal visual of what 'the life' really is not.
The fourth season is just as much on-the-edge, just as full of new/bizarre events, as the first three. Unbelievable.
Personally, I thought Sopranos was cheesy and 'full of drugs and violence,""- yet with no worries, predictable murders, sooh day-to-day. It tried to make the most greedy/base/-bunch -of meatheads- seem to have a good life. It worked if you like to see guys with blood in their fingernails eat interesting gourmet Italian food, and go back to it.  My opinion, Sopranos, were wanting to 'be all-Godfather,' and fell flat.
Instead, I see Breaking Bad as a true tragedy of events, NOTHING about it glorifies violence. No one enjoys the money being made. No parties, no fancy cars and vacaions and women throwing themselves around the guys.
Gut wrenching violence, new rules, old rules, it never gets slow and its never over. Drugs are shown to be a much deadlier business than most people can imagine or realize.
We generally are dulled by chronic stories of bad guys, with watered down content, or by the latest news updates. It seems that fairly young people actually listen to some of the dumbest rap, and watch some of the duller 'hood' videos on MTV. As if these fake rich guys and some cheap-acting young women are all actually drawn to the dream of livin-large-just driving around in 250 grand cars all day, doin nothin-what a load.
Breaking Bad blows that 'stoopit-stylin' fairytale to pieces.
The REALISM HERE is what draws me in.  People don't get rich, they die tryin. Its real drug life, most people/, most young people, know that.
But seein a family man stand up to a very angry cartel boss.. is stellar, if unlikely.  Cranston is tough enough, AND smart enough to hold the line.  Buy some time.  Minute by minute.",1318982400,,6459,4.549053356282272

4610603,5,B0058YPG1G,"The best television dramas of all time don't TELL you what is good or bad, or WHO is good or bad - they let people be people, and then you form your own opinions of the characters.  From the Sopranos, to the Wire, to the Shield, and now Breaking Bad.  And honestly, I think this may surpass them all, even the Sopranos.

Meet Walter White. Well, if you're already on Season 4, I assume you know his story.  From dorky chemistry teacher/car wash worker to million-dollar methamphetamine cook, the transformation is unbelievable, yet believable at the same time.  You know his story, how he got here, and it all seems to fit.  The writers have made it clear for a long time that Breaking Bad was similar to Scarface - that Walt is comparable to the transformation of Mr. Chips to Scarface, and this season shows that perfectly.

Walt has and still believes coming into season 4 that he is doing this all for his family.  But is he?  How far will he go?  And is this all for money, or something else?  We get to see many ethical dilemmas and inner moral battles in most of the characters this season - Walt, Skyler, Jesse, Mike, Hank, Marie and even maybe a small glimpse into the past of chicken man and meth king-pin - Gustavo Fring.

Each episode gets more and more dark (did you think it was possible?), and Walt continues to surprise the audience with strange decisions and a terrifying look into the path he is going down.  If you look back at season 1 episode 1, before the meth and cancer, that angry, tortured individual was already inside of him.  That results in the question: was Walt ever even really that good of a guy?  He hasn't changed as much as you may think, but his anguish, pain, and stress is amplified by about 200x.  And as expected, the end of each episode is usually a major cliff-hanger, and you'll be begging for more.

The acting is nothing but simply perfect.  Bryan Cranston as Walt will make you laugh, cry, or even get angry with him.  Giancarlo Esposito as Gus becomes a huge player this season, and he should be up for an Emmy.  The glazed, empty, evil look in his eyes is terrifying, and there aren't many boundaries he won't cross to get what he wants.

This is definitely the darkest, thought-provoking, best acted show on television at the moment, and maybe ever.  If you haven't watched it, start from the beginning and follow Walt's odd and morally perplexing adventure into the life of a meth cook.",1318464000,211,2438,4.480725623582766
4610604,5,B0058YPG1G,"WARNING: This Series Is Extremely Addictive (Spoiler FREE Review)

This series truly has a perfect balance. The drama, both crime and family, is portrayed excellently. There is a nice blend of dark and light humor. The action and tension keeps you addicted and craving more. Then there are equal parts of character development and exploration that add a nice depth to the mix. Add all those elements together and they have found the perfect formula for this series. It really earns it's reputation as one of television's greatest series (filling a specific void that has been lingering since series like The Sopranos, The Shield and The Wire left our screens). This season is great and Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to show how they earned their respective 2010 Best Lead/Supporting Actor Emmy Awards. Their pairing and subsequent chemistry are what binds this series together.

Some have said this season was too slow for too long and that the series lost its previously inspired pacing, I had similar thoughts but trusted the writing staff and if the beginning of the season is slower paced the last four or five episodes certainly balance out the equation with nonstop twists, action and developments.

The fourth season consists of the following thirteen episodes:

1 Box Cutter
2 Thirty-Eight Snub
3 Open House
4 Bullet Points
5 Shotgun
6 Cornered
7 Problem Dog
8 Bug
9 Hermanos
10 Salud
11 Crawl Space
12 End Times
13 Face Off

This season is once again amazingly crafted. It picks up exactly where the third season left off with a suspenseful and eventful premiere that sets up a conflict that plays out the entire season, slow burn has been most used to describe it. If it seemed to slow down after that initial episode and focus on character exploration it can be forgiven as the show has earned that by this point. By episode 9 things are clearly building to an endpoint of magnificent crafting and the final 5 episodes are amazingly entertaining in escalating proportion. The key to this fourth season will be rewatch value, what seemed to be slower paced filler will be seen in second viewing as establishing important plotlines that needed to pay off by the finale.  A finale which Gilligan has said was crafted to be satisfactory as a series finale in case the show didn't make it back (which thankfully it has).

*The one thing I agree felt random though was a storyline that once again focused on Marie stealing things, not sure what that paid off towards in the long term? Anyone else have ideas?

Special Features:

I'll list the official specs when they are announced but these sets always have behind the scenes and some informative audio commentaries with Vince Gilligan and the actors. While I love Mad Men and those sets reveal a lot of information in their commentaries they are nowhere near the Breaking Bad sets when it comes to behind-the-scenes. The Breaking Bad sets are, in my opinion, the best television series sets you can buy for your money.  Both in terms of features and the aforementioned rewatch value.

The other thing about Breaking Bad, and I've said it before but will keep saying it, is that it has it's own unique niche. There are other great series on television, arguably Mad Men, Walking Dead and Boardwalk Empire among others, but Breaking Bad has something all its own. It doesn't have a period setting, it doesn't have any supernatural elements such as vampires or zombies, it is set in a modern day reality. While those other things are fun, Breaking Bad is a refreshing series that doesn't have to pay service to anything other than its story. This means that it is always attemping to tell its story in unique and interesting ways. They are always trying to break new ground and push the envelope in every way. The directing, the music selection, the writing/storytelling, every single element of this series tries to do something new or original and it is quite apparent when watching any of the episodes.  Viewers also have to realize how little funds this great series is given to work with in comparison with others, keeping that in mind I'd say they definitely utilize their money for optimum production value. So if this season seems to play slower in the begining I say that after three amazing seasons the writer's and crew have earned that right. This will no doubt be the most breathing room the series ever has, now that there are officially only 16 episodes left in its production life, they will be running towards a finish in a fashion one can only expect from Breaking Bad.

I should note I own the first three seasons on Blu-ray and they look great, but I've also seen them on DVD and they still look pretty darn good, so DVD buyer's won't be missing much. That said I'll definitely being going all in for the fourth time and getting the Blu-ray. I had withdrawal symptoms while waiting between the third and fourth seasons and while I hope they take time to craft the final 16 episodes properly I really want to get my next fix started by next year at this time. I can't wait to buy this and hopefully it comes out long before the fifth season so that I can have a temporary fix, though I assume they will try to coincide its release with the next season premiere as per usual.",1318377600,3,5256,4.68763557483731

The whole cast 'Rocks'.  Gilligan (The Creator) really put the icing on the cake.  Everything came together perfectly and still left room for next season.  I never speculate about Breaking Bad because it is so much more fun to wait and see what Gilligan will come up with next.  I am not sure what I will do when the series ends because the show has become my favorite thing to watch, hands down. Cranston, Paul, and Esposito are the ultimate actors.  Gus became one of my favorites and when he walked out of that nursing home room I was on my feet saying ""What?, What?"" then the panorama to his right side and I nearly fell over.  Then I started laughing because of the episodes title. Gilligan, you are a genius. I own a copy of every season and can't wait for season 4 to go on sale.

This is one of the best shows on television (along with Dexter) - really makes me wonder why I continue to waste my money on horrible box-office drek when some of the best and most engaging work is being done on TV.  From the entirely plausible premise of the first episode to this breath-taking season finale, I have found myself continually identifying with ""Walter White"" (Bryan Cranston's best work - ever) - a decent man faced with increasingly horrifying choices who simply wants to provide for and protect his family - and finds he will take any steps necessary to do so.  Riveting performances from the superb cast, all the way through, and a fantastically satisfying conclusion (where will they go from here)?  Walter White's last words - ""I won"" - followed by the slow pan across his yard to the flower-pot (and unlike others, I did NOT see that coming) revealing just how determined to win he actually was, gave me chills.  Also not to be overlooked are the darkly clever episode titles, with this last episode's -""Face Off"" - being most appropriate.",1318291200,3,1077,4.774193548387097
4610671,4,B0058YPG1G,"Anti-hero show.  Does not glorify drug use, in fact it does a pretty good job coming down hard on it.  ""Walt"" (Bryan Cranston from Drive, Malcolm in the middle) is an incredible actor and really nails the character.  He can handle the script, has the acting chops (who would of guessed a largely comedy actor had such drama chops) and makes his part real and gritty.

""Jesse"" (Aaron Paul) actually won an Emmy Award for season 1 (I think?) so I guess they gave him a larger role in seasons 2-4.  Don't get me wrong he does an outstanding job, it's just his dialog parts too often seem longer and speech oriented, as opposed to plot development.  I found myself disengaged a couple of time throughout the season with him.

Overall, a great series about drug abuse that even points out indirectly most meth heads do not get clean (I think 3% that try have one year clean).  Violent too, though again it shows meths effect on society.",1318291200,3,931,4.5

4610675,5,B0058YPG1G,"This is my favorite show on TV right now. Seasons 1-3 are masterpieces and I thought S4 would be no less than amazing. Season 4 started off with a bang by having the scene where Gus shows us how truly monstrous he really is.

I admit, for much of the season the show got a bit slow. But the last episodes certainly make up for the earlier slowness of the show. And the very last episode has one of the most epic scenes in the entire series (won't spoil it here but I'll just say that Gus has gotten what he deserves). This season seems to be more about tension and suspense for most of the season rather than action and it really delivers because my heart was beating quite fast in quite a few moments this past season.

Like past seasons the acting by the entire cast is awesome. Cranston and Paul continue to shine in their roles as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman and deserve the awards they have received so far. Giancarlo Esposito is amazing as Gus and is one of my favorite TV villains ever (he really needs to at least be nominated for best supporting actor). And, of course, every other cast member are perfect in their roles as well.

The people that create the DVDs and Blu-Rays have been awesome at making the DVDs/Blu-Rays better with more audio commentaries as each season is released. I hope there is an audio commentary on every episode for Season 4....I cannot wait to hear the commentaries on some of the episodes!!

Overall, these last episodes have saved the season and kept it on par with the past three seasons and I cannot wait for season 5!",1318204800,5,1562,4.3944636678200695

However, it took me until Jesse reported what the doctors said about the kid's illness to figure out who was setting up whom.  Up till then I was just on the edge of my seat wondering who was going to win/live or lose/die.  That the old bitter old man in the nursing home is used as a conduit towards final resolution is a stroke of dramatic genius. This episode turns almost entirely on Walt, Jesse and Gus. Our other characters are just very minor in this OK Corral type episode. I have no idea what they are going to do for next season as this season certainly left no cliff hangers.

This episode redeemed the whole season's bad moments IMO.

==== SPOILER ====
I said I wouldn't watch the next season, I think I will... and my smile will fade once I see Gus's face again... who probably survived and have this weird scary looking aspect. I really hope this doesn't happen at all.

Writers: Please let the predictable and unoriginal character of Gus be gone for good. I don't think the actor is bad, I just think the character isn't believable at all, it even looks laughable. And where is Mike?! He really is funny/believable/intimidating and somehow loyal.

So I didn't think the ante could be upped any further but I was wrong. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat all during this episode because I never expected that the sphere of death would radiate further out than that. The creators have not even made it super clear who is the one who just perpetrated the latest heinous act of probable murder, which does affect yet another character, and a very sympathetic one at that.

Many characters are scrambling for protection with the DEA or leaving town altogether.  It is primarily Walt who is still out there in the open.  So is Jesse if he breaks the present ""cooking"" understanding with Gus. This show has one more season planned so obviously not everyone can be killed as we come to the close of this season.  i would be surprised if we did not have some deaths take place though.

It is interesting to me how everyone with the DEA is fooled by Gus's Chicken King and philanthropist front.

This is new plot twist doesn't make sense to me and I hope it is not what it seems.  Jessie even said it himself that he had the cigarette in the morning so how are you going to blame someone that wasn't even there at the facility(Mr. White) or Saul (even more far fetched).  So Gus, who has been highly intelligent, calculating, and who plans out every move ahead of time, is going to use the cigarette's poison, knowing there was no way Mr. White had access to it, in the hope that Jessie fingers Mr. White instead of him? Just seems like a wild shot in the dark plan that is uncharacteristic of Gus.  But the writers of the show made it play out that way anyway making Jessie look like a tool, he is but not that bad. Because the plot twist didn't make any sense, the whole confrontation between Jessie and Mr. White seemed out of place, even forced, to further a somewhat new direction in the show; them teaming up again.  The very last scene of the episode left me open to the idea that maybe what happened is not what it appears to be.  We the audience don't know what really happened to Brock, we only have Mr. White's conclusion of what happened...

That'd explain the high ratings. The reason? Well, this show started out well, it had a terrific concept. In a week I became a fan of this show. As I started watching Season 4 I began to notice the shift. Looking at this episode now, I can't believe how I went from being hooked and loving this show, to almost hating it.

The idea of watching this nerdy geek teacher going bad seemed pretty cleaver. It was like a promised of dark humor; not any more. The tone has become dark and too dramatic. I feel disappointed. I don't need to tune (or buy) to watch something like this. I don't need to, watching the weak people being kicked around is what I see every day in life. I was hoping to see him kicking ass. Two of the coolest and most memorable parts in the whole series (so far), was the ""Stay out of my territory"" and ""This... is not meth..."" scenes, where you even get the chills realizing what a b@da$$ guy a feeble man can turn into when put between a rock and a hard place.

Almost every show out there is about this bad guy in a suit having the power to, and usually almost successfully, disposing of the guy we're rooting for (for the most part). This proved again this story is going down the tubes little by little. Maybe this is what happens when you let all this bunch of writers scribble all over what was once a terrific script and concept.

To be honest, I'm not surprised the show's ratings went up and down. I've already lost interest in it. I won't be watching another season of this. I just won't. This story was good while it lasted as it was intended.",1317600000,2,1745,4.2342342342342345

So many questions, and yet, Gus still seems to have all the answers.  That is why this is the true Masterpiece of television drama.  Each episode leads seamlessly to the next, and every tiny detail needs to be inventoried by the viewer.  Still, the surprises never end!

His one older kid, almost grown has special needs of a physical nature. This means Dad needs more to provide, to help his son keep ahead of his physical challenge. Plus,a suprise 'change of life' baby is coming. How the lead goes from being a science teacher to the depths of what he ends up in.. is an astounding story. I am a cynical person, I find most tv and movies to be overdone or dumb. I like maybe 3-4 other TV shows. 'Lie to Me,' 'Mad Men,' the new show about a woman on the Chicago Police Force (Sept. 2011) and 'House,' generally when House is at his worst. I only wish the show House did not make all pain patients seem like addicts. There are endless vets and so many other people who have real pain, and use only medication that a doctor allows. Breaking Bad has characters we can recognize, and also bits of ourselves or putz-es we have known, as well as many of the present stresses and threats around us now.  To me the subject matter is so well presented, we realize just how desperate some people are.. its not just words on the 10 o'clock news. Fear, joy, rage.. supressed emotions.. underlying thoughts..its here, its big, cant believe it showed up on AMC! A marriage where the wife does not even know her husband is terminal.. she drifts away from his moodiness. Her suspicious sister in law fans the flames. Husband is torn to shreds, seems to be dying and yet is working, traveling.. its wrenching /a show this gritty- on tv?/ who woulda thunk. I have watched it from the first episode, week by week, on AMC, until now. Yes each season is as compelling as the last. The language, the suspense, the bizarre yet believable..is continual. Its full of stunning challenge and deadlines, threats, and people caught up trying to squeak thru the worst situations.  I would not recommend it for kids..maybe about 18 years old would be better.. -if you could keep kids at 18 away from it.  That is, unless you thought your kids should see Sopranos butchering people constantly. I found Sopranos sickening and fictionally too glamorous/repetitive butchering as the price for a big home- ('so what, who cares!') But Breaking Bad is also splotched with violent bits. Volatile is the word used here on Amazon.

The show is soooo good that I wouldnt even have brought up the spanish issue if they kept those scenes to a minimum, but they went and made very long and important moments only speaking a terrible spanish, I do think it hurts the show. Other than that is an excellent TV series.",1316736000,4,893,4.47239263803681

4610759,5,B0058YPG1G,"The fact that I am reviewing a DVD that hasn't been produced yet for a series year that hasn't been completed yet should be a solid indicator that I am a big fan of this show.  Season 4 is every bit as good as the previous three seasons, and my only criticism is that Season 5 will apparently be the last for the series.  This is sad news for me -- I've been spending each week anticipating with pleasure what new bad decision the series characters will make.  They seem to have an inexhaustible repertoire, especially, of course, Walt.

I don't want to discuss the show in too much detail, since that would lead to spoilers, so instead I will make a few bold predictions.  I have the feeling that the show is going to end badly for almost everybody, and if someone comes out alive and whole at the end, it will just be due to good luck. Walt is almost certainly a dead man, as he himself remarked in a recent episode.  Most likely, as the series ends, he will either die of cancer or finally fall victim to one of his numerous criminal enemies.  Jesse will either die of an overdose or get rubbed out (my money is on the former), and his surviving business partners, Skinny Pete and Badger will wind up in jail.  Hank will either get too close to Gus' operation and have a fatal accident, or, he might just keel over and die from a heart attack.  Marie and Skyler will most likely end up in jail, the former for renewed binges of shoplifting, the latter for accounting fraud, although Sky is crafty enough to get out of town with the cash before that happens, so maybe it won't turn out all bad for her. Meanwhile, Gus will either wind up sipping tequila on a Caribbean island, or in a hole in the desert.  I can't see him getting put in the slammer as he's too smart for that. Maybe he'll go back to Chile, as he seems to have something of a criminal past there. Mike, like any good soldier, will either follow Gus into exile or wind up in the same hole in the desert. Finally Saul will almost certainly end up behind bars, or murdered by an irate client, or perhaps both if he happens to land in the wrong prison.  Like I said, it looks bad for almost everybody, but that's what keeps me watching. As one of the few major characters not involved in some sort of criminal activity, Walter Jr. will probably go on to college and become a chemist, like his dad, in preparation for the spinoff series, Breaking Bad, Part 2.

Season 4 lives up to the standards of excellence set by the previous seasons. What I love is how the writers have no fear of painting themselves in a corner.  You wonder if they even know how to get their characters out of jam or are they guessing like the rest of us?

TRUE ROMANCE is a favorite crime movie of virtually every fan of that genre.  Its shootout scene is a movie classic.  Quentin Tarantino wrote it before he began directing.

4610777,4,B0058YPG1G,"...but oh, man, it gets tiresome watching Walt make one unbeleivably bad decision after another.  He's supposed to be the smart one.  Meanwhile, he gets his brother-in-law back on his trail by intimating the dead guy they found isn't the real ""Heisenburg"", he buys $300 bottles of wine and a souped up sports car for his son.  He won't listen to sense from his wife - hey, Walt, how do you account for all this cash?  Oh, yeah, card shark!  His boss in an effort to make Jessie less of a liability has him team up with one of the muscle guys just to keep him busy, but Walter can't see the good in that - instead he brings in some of the local cleaning ladies to help clean up 'the lab' while Jessie's not there, whereon they are all deported back to Honduras afterwards!  Really, it's a joke how unreasonable and argumentative Walter has become - Jessie is seeming the sane one!

I started getting into this fourth season toward the end of the second episode, and once it gets going the season really does take off..

Just a note though.. I've had my reservations about Breaking Bad since Season 3 where one whole show was shot in the lab with them trying to kill a fly.  Whether or not it gave us insight into Walter's character it had seemed mainly like filler and that the writers were running out of ideas (note to the writers:  avoid too much time in the lab).  Well, I was sort of geared up for more of the same when I started Season 4 of Breaking Bad and the first episode didn't do a whole lot to change my general wariness..

However, by the end of the second episode and on, interest kicks in and holds out pretty strong for the bulk of the season but by the last few episodes it starts losing steam mainly due to too many plot contrivances.  The first is that Jessie starts dominating Walt, throwing him around and beating him up in a few scenes and that just looks fake.  There's no way Jessie would be throwing Walt around, who is a lot bigger, stronger, and with even more attitude than when the show started with him as a mild mannered chem teacher.  For people who say this series is believable, explain that.  Then Walt makes a bomb all of a sudden - like hey, do they teach chem students that in grad school?  No, but perhaps they teach it to screenplay writers in ""Plot Contrivance 101"".  Unfortunately for the series,  scenes like this give the impression that they're grabbing at straws again.

Breaking Bad, Season 4 has many good moments, and many weak ones as well, and while the writing is way far-fetched (though fun mostly) to begin with, Cranston's acting in earlier episodes is sometimes so over-the-top as to be unbelievable (sad to say, most of the best scenes this season usually involve characters other than Walt somehow). Later, it's less his acting that's over the top, and more the ridiculousnous of the scenarios, like when we're supposed to accept that the drug boss poisons the child of Jessie's girlfriend with the cigarette Walt had given Jessie.. like, what??!!!  And that Jessie thinks Walt had something to do with it!  Puh-lease.

I've enjoyed this season more than the previous one, and a lesser season of Breaking Bad is still better than most, but what made the first 2 seasons so great was that it didn't go so far off the deep end as to completely defy the laws of logic.",1315872000,5,3323,4.4561983471074385

4610820,5,B0058YPG1G,"Anna Gunn as Skyler shines in this episode.  The guy she used to work for as an accountant shows up, telling her he's got criminal IRS problems.  He cooked the books and the IRS thinks it is on to him.  In a total bravura performance, Skyler turns up at his criminal audit looking like the trashiest broad imaginable. She paints a picture of herself to the IRS as her boss's girlfriend given the job for no other reason.  Left to her own devices, she managed the company's books using the Quicken Program which she considers the most advanced technology on the planet.  The IRS agent looks increasingly pained as this audit continues. The Quicken admission almost gives him a heart attack as this is a big company.

On the grimmer side of the story, Jesse and Walt continue to fight over Gus.  Walt wants Gus dead whereas Jesse has gotten used to working with Mike, Gus's henchman, who treats him a lot better than Walt ever has. A wedge is being driven between these two and their united front against Gus unravels. Bryan Cranston (Walt) and Aaron Paul (Jesse) erupt into rage with fists against one another and it is a great sequence, almost like a ballet.

Meanwhile Hank is still hot on the case.  One big problem Gus has is that he is simply too clean.  That makes Hank more suspicious, not less.

Picture Hank moving in towards Walt and Jesse on one end, Gus moving in on them from the other end, the two of them coming apart at the sames as far as a united front smack dab in the middle--well, it's Shakespeare, isn't it? An epic tragedy continues to unfold and one wonders who will survive it, if anyone.

4610822,5,B0058YPG1G,"The season is developing differently than I had expected.  That's a good thing.  One of my many favorite things about Breaking Bad is that no matter how closely you pay attention and how many times you rewatch the episodes, you always end up being surprised.

There have been so many crime dramas, not that I like to pick on CSI, but that is one of the best examples, that purposely divert your attention one moment, and then the next, bombards you with CGI'd dramatizations that are wildly inaccurate of procedures or details.  They are programs that are designed for presentation with commercials, popping popcorn or multitasking where the content is so simplistic that you can miss or lose concentration and still follow the story.  Not much of a challenge.  It's also vastly different from completely formulaic series like Numbers and a lot of the mystery series from the past, that gave you new characters, but largely the same story or plot.  There was one when I was a child, called Murder She Wrote that had almost the same three story lines every week.

Breaking Bad is one of a kind.  It takes you down a road, one degree separating your reality, one misstep, one flakey decision, one unexpected life-down-turn from where and who you are.  Nothing is so far-fetched that it couldn't happen to you or someone you know, and yet, the adrenaline pumps constantly.  You want to slap Walt or Jesse senseless.  Or, you wonder what is going on a few doors or blocks from you...no matter where you live.

I really think that Walt is going through the stages of grief as the plot unfolds, with a huge emphasis on his anger over having completely lost control of his life.  He keeps trying to feed his ego to avoid dealing with his ultimate fate.  He throws himself into the mouth of danger only to freak himself out and end up panicked into a frenzy to save himself.  He tries to believe he can control those around him, and yet, the harder the tries, the more mistakes he makes...

This week he proves he needs anger-management therapy...as well as driving lessons.  Jesse and Skyler learn more about moving on, and Hank takes it up a notch. Gus gives us clues as to who he really is, although, once again, paying attention to previous episodes would have helped us to see him as he is.

Finally, are we going to learn more about a powerful government agent with a greying moustache?

I just know the layers never seem to end, and now that I know there will be a fifth season, what will lay the groundwork for it?

We also see that Hank is really a very fine detective.  The case has brought him back to life and even though he will probably never walk right again, his life is livable as long as he keeps his spirit intact.

A fine humorous note occurs at the cancer scan station.  Walt previously thought cancer was the worst thing that had ever happened to him.  He had used it to justify ever insane action he's taken ever since.  He sits next to a younger man, also waiting for his cancer scan.  This man comments about how horrible cancer is and Walt says in response that cancer is barely a blip in his life, that so many more serious things have occurred that he can barely even afford to think about being a cancer patient!  He is being utterly serious and that is what dealing with drug cartels, drug partners, the DEA, including a DEA relative, have brought him to in his almost unbearable life.",1315353600,5,1190,4.397260273972603

I'm watching the final two episodes of last season again tonight because small things matter, and problem dogs are not always what we think they are...or who.  Right now, I have my eye on a man with a greying moustache and a certain law enforcement agency...

I love a program that makes me use my imagination!  This one could train us all to be Sherlock Holmes, or darned-good CSIs.  Little, minute details come back to the characters and the plot in the most interesting ways.

I was wrong...and right in speculations last week about the Challenger.  Yet, another of Walt's house of cards that has to topple.  Everything Walt does this season reflects a comment about him early on...an underachiever who walked away from great potential because of his ego.  This season, his ego and his frustration over not being able to flaunt his success will be his undoing, and he will take pretty much everyone with him.

Jesse is finally beginning to understand his potential and his role in sculpting his life, such as it is.  He's finally listening to important little birds, but it's probably too late for him, even with epiphanies blossoming in front of him.  Aaron Paul needs to share best actor with Bryan Cranston this year.  Much as I love Michael C. Hall in Dexter, their intensity is the quiet scream of our own souls as they lash out, plot their futures, understand their past and make grand mistakes in judgement.  The difference between them and us is that they are the games our minds play with us each and every day.  They are us in a parallel Universe.  They are us in our worst fantasies...and in the end, fortunately, they are not us in our actions.

Giancarlo Esposito, Gus Frin, is the master villain because he is the master manipulator, the master negotiator and to him, life has become a game where he doesn't care how he benefits, only how he plays, and yet, he has made at least two potentially fatal mistakes.

Skyler is in so far over her head that she is drowning in the ocean that was once her backyard pool.  Everything that Walt has done and the situation, as she becomes more aware of it, simply pulls her farther out into a rip-tide she could never imagine.  How do you launder the kind of money the carwash is supposed to handle?  Where can she even put it?  And then, of course, there is Walt, his ego, his anger and his mouth...

Hank has put enough together that he pretty much has to be the target again...Gus won't like where he is going.  Walt may go over some paranoid brink.  Of course, Jesse is still between Hank's cross-hairs, and would be the weakest link in putting things together...But what about the guy with the greying moustache?

My imagination races with each new episode...and why is it that I keep feeling like painting a velvet portrait of Vince Gilligan with a beam of light shining down on him, and a halo above his head...No, wait!  Are those horns?

This season seems to be about questions.  This episode leaves us questioning the future of everyone and every situation in the series.

Walt has spiraled down to a point where it is hard to believe he can ever dig himself, much less anyone else out of the muck he has created.  Jesse, on the other hand, is proving he has skills and worth to Gus, who makes Donald Trump look like the manager of a hot dog stand...and then there is Hank, not making an appearance in this episode, but no doubt, much recovered and re-energized in the next...

I now have at least twelve scenarios in my little mind, swimming around as I speculate on the end of this season, although it is only half over, and possibly the series...even though I want it to go on forever.

I have one question for the next episode: Walter Jr is out cruising around the block in his birthday-mobile, but is that situation too simple?  Remember, this series takes us back and by surprise over and over...  Has anyone else noticed that while babies can be replaced by look-alikes, and adults age little over four seasons which represent a much shorter time-span in the series, a teenager who was fourteen or fifteen when the series started has a hard time looking like he is coming up on sixteen for someone born in 1993...just saying...Walt's bad decisions seem to have ever-worsening consequences...remember the driving lesson where Walter Jr had a hard time using one foot on the brake and one foot on the gas?

There are two blaring clues to the last seven (I can't believe it!  Say it isn't so!!!) episodes of this season.  I'm not telling.

I don't know how much adrenaline my body can take, but this one tests it once again!

I actually found three continuity issues.  The most glaring is that with the rearview mirrors in Walt and Mike's vehicles, one second they're there, the next second, they're gone.  This is an issue that has bothered me with movies and TV since I can remember.  It's just annoying, and apparently the only way to deal with some scenes logistically.  The next is Walt's glasses.  They keep tipping them in different ways to avoid glare and reflection.  One minute, the right temple will be half an inch above his ear, and the next, it will be in place.  His lenses have gone from lined bifocals early on, to progressive lenses later.  That makes some sense, because he is more prosperous.  However in a scene where they are sitting on a table and we see through them, although there is a prescription, there is no multifocal distortion.  The third issue is a dropped drum that magically changes direction 90 degrees in a couple of scenes.

These are are imperfections in what I consider to be the most perfectly produced series ever, and the only reason I notice these things is that because every tiny detail, from a dropped word to a seemingly meaningless object ends up interlacing into the story in future episodes.  I feel like Vince Gilligan must somehow be related to the Coen brothers for his seemless story-telling.

The thing is that I have become hyper-aware of every detail in every episode, and when continuity is dropped or set aside for simplicity, I catch more and more of it.

Even detailing these few flaws, I find myself typing away with the anticipation of a small child on Christmas eve as I wait until tomorrow morning when I can watch episode 6!

The surprising twist with the 'set-up' on Mike and Jesse's trip was a suspenseful touch, and this episode, like so many others in the series, illustrates what great television does to you; it leaves one hungry for more.  And while the context is important for comprehension of the series, I really feel like Breaking Bad excels at drawing a convincing 'short story' with most episodes; if I knew nothing of the show, I still could have enjoyed this A+ episode.  While nothing was so mesmerizing about any particular scene, by the time we are at the end of the episode, I can do nothing but wonder obsessively about next weeks chapter... Will Hank piece together the evidence, especially now after hearing the alcohol fueled, ego driven, boastful rant made by Walt?  What was Esposito's purpose in making Jesse a 'hero'?  Why can't I fast forward life to next Sunday? (bc I want more Breaking Bad!)",1313366400,3,925,4.7625
4610866,5,B0058YPG1G,"I rarely purchase tv series on DVD.......this is the best written,most creative, dark,fantastically human,amazingly addictive television show I've seen since well forever.....My boyfriend rented season 1 for me to watch and we watched it together I was hooked 15 minutes into the first episode. We then went and rented season 2 finished both in one weekend each. Then Season 3 getting ready to come out in video store and I couldn't stand it so I went to the local big box retailer and purchased season three......if one and two don't blow your mind season three well...... lets just say I didn't think the writing or the acting could maintain or for that matter get any better and damn I was wrong........fantastic. I am so addicted I went ahead and purchased from Amazon Season 1 & 2. I am into the 4th season on TV and can't wait wait wait for Season 4 on DVD. Best ever tv show! A must see for all . Even if you are not a tv series person.....you won't be able to stop......I bet someone will have to come up with a Breaking Bad detox program when this show stops......Just when you think you've seen the best and the worst in all the characters......BAM! Something else reaches out of the TV and grabs your brain and forces your eyes to pop out and your mouth to drop to the floor.....
Start from the beginning though so you can watch the characters change and evolve and come into their own........outfrickinstanding!!!!!!",1313107200,154,1428,4.625984251968504
4610867,5,B0058YPG1G,"These past four episodes have all been top notch with the premiere titled, ""Box Cutter"" being BB's best season opener to date. Looking forward to the rest. I know for a certainty that the series won't let the true fans of the show down. It only gets better, darker, and even more addictive as it goes on.

4610910,5,B0058YPG1G,"I can't believe I am the only fan commenting on the new season.

The last two episodes have built to a level where I'm pretty sure I didn't breathe the first five minutes of this one and I stopped again for the last five minutes.  In between, my heart was racing, and seeing Gale again was treat, but my heart raced another hour after I watched it!

The last episode and Episode 2 both built beautifully to this one, and, as always, with superb and all-too-real performances, along with amazing writing and production values literally bless us with what I consider to be the best series of all time.

I can't give anything away as a spoiler, other than the title, which you will get from an earlier episode, but for sheer adrenaline production and intelligent content, this proves again to be the series to watch.

If all that was on television was Breaking Bad and Dexter, it might be a bit much, but add The IT Crowd and The Big Bang Theory for laughs (without incessant commercials!) and I find entertainment Nirvana!

4610911,5,B0058YPG1G,"I begin each new season of Breaking Bad nervous that it will let me down.  I am nervous that the show will begin to stray from what made it good in the first place.  Once again, though, the show has stayed true to its characters, its tone, and its story.

If you've followed the show up to this season, you will not be disappointed.  Now that I'm three episodes in, I have to say that each of the characters (the leads, Walt and Jesse, Walt's ""boss"" Gus, laywer Saul, wife Skyler, and his in-laws Hank and Marie) is a joy to watch.  My only disappointment is that I have seen too little of RJ Mitte in the role of Walt Jr.  Hopefully, we will see more of him as the season develops.

If you've never watched the show, go back to the first season and give it a shot.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1312329600,6,804,4.141935483870967
4610912,5,B0058YPG1G,"Marie, Hank's wife, is given a chance to really show her stuff this episode.  She is amazingly good.  I never think too much about her character but the writers evidently had not forgotten her. Marie starts to unravel from the constant pressure of living with Hank. She starts attending real estate open houses.  At each of them, she engages the owners and agents with elaborate tales from entirely made-up lives.  Before she leaves, she steals something from the house too. Each of these open house visits is an absolute gem of acting.

We also continue to view the car wash purchasing saga plus Jesse's fragile mental state.",1312329600,4,626,4.813084112149533
4610913,3,B0058YPG1G,"The first 3 episodes have been shown on AMC. To this point in time, the episodes have lost a sense of power to draw me in. It seems that the writers are adrift and are relying on old themes. I do hope the season improves with the next episode and onwards. So far, Season 4 only rates average, .. 3 stars.",1312243200,9,304,4.0
4610914,5,B0058YPG1G,"To start iwth, let me say that it continues to amaze me how many people I run into who still have not seen the show Breaking Bad. It has won so many award, it has incredibly great actors with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, the storyline is great, and it is overall one of the best shows on TV.  Enough of the rant--onto Season 4!  So it feels as if it has been quite a while between Seasons 3 and 4 and when I saw that it was back on, I danced a small jig and prepared to download the episodes and watch.  ""Jesse"" is really the star of the show in the first two episodes. He goes from being the big party guy to sitting on the floor crying. He continues to not be super sure who he is or what he wants to be. Almost like he wants to break out of the rut he is in but doesnt know how.  Dean Norris plays brother-in-law Hank who continues to recover from a shooting in the previous season and has taken up an interesting new hobby collecting ""rocks."" Finally, it is not super clear in the early episodes how Walt and Skyler are going to pan out in terms of their ""marriage"" but one can imagine that sorting itself out this season.  This really is a great show that has taken many twists and turns but continues to be super interesting and compelling appointment TV.",1312243200,2,1263,4.117886178861789

4610916,4,B0058YPG1G,"The morphing of milquetoast Walter White from utterly defeated chemistry genius to razor-edged gangster is one of the most compelling portrayals on any screen, much less television. This episode, a transitional one, does not have the drama that other eps might have, from top to bottom this episode does nothing but add to what has become the best show on TV.",1311897600,3,359,4.901639344262295
4610917,5,B0058YPG1G,"Aaron Paul as Jesse is really given a chance to shine in this episode.  We really get to see the complex layers in his personality.  In one scene he is the cool party guy with lots of money to throw huge parties every single night.  In another scene, the girl whose son he saved realizes he was the one who left her a huge wad of money to get a better life in a better neighborhood.  But best of all, we see him falling apart, still not able to deal with having killed someone to save Walter's life.  It is an all out masterful performance.

Not that Hank and Walt are just idle in this episode.  Hank is amassing huge chunks of rocks from his ebay buys as a mineral collector while he makes minute progress in physical therapy.  His attitude has not improved a whit. Walt decides buying an untraceable gun from an arms dealer might be the way to go in solving his problems with Gus.  This might be viewed as comic relief, he is so bad on handling a gun.",1311811200,2,954,4.169398907103825
4610918,5,B0058YPG1G,"This is one of the few episodes each season which is used to set up the rest of the season.  Without spoiling it, think of Very Bad Things.

One problem I did have is that every time the scene switched to Jesse's ""home"" I had to turn the sound way down.  When you combine his sound system with a good home theater, you get ear-splitting results.  A bit of advice:  Keep your volume control close.

Watch the little things in this episode.  If you know this series, you know how important miniscule details become.",1311638400,2,513,4.3936170212765955
