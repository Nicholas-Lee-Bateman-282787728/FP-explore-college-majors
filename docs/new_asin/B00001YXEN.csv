1247515,5,B00001YXEN,"What happens when one of a pair of conjoined sisters (played by the real-life Hilton twins who were also in Tod Browning's Freaks) falls in love with a cad?  Why, jealousy and murder, of course!!  But who committed the murder?  How do you punish the guilty party when you would also have to throw the innocent sister into jail?  What does one twin do while the other one is on a date?  These questions and more are addressed in this amazing film which will leave your jaw hanging down to knee level.
Unfortunately, the film has little plot and is filled with a lot of padding, but where else will you see a film about jealousy and murder starring real conjoined twins?",1085875200,4,668,4.442622950819672
1247516,1,B00001YXEN,"I love cult movies and this one is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  The plot seemed interesting enough:  one Siamese twin commits a murder, but what will happen to them?  They can't put the  innocent one in jail, but can't let the guilty one go free.  However, there  is really no conclusion and it was so slow that i almost couldn't finish  watching it.",949104000,8,376,4.211267605633803
1247517,5,B00001YXEN,"It's a really bad movie but, AHS Freak Show reignited my interest in the ""Freaks"" of carnival sideshows. I knew about the Hilton's and found Bound by Flesh their life story on Netflix.  I could not find Chained for Life to stream so, I bought the movie for entertainment and to be able to see them function and live as the movie is based on their lives.  As a movie it's really bad.  So bad that it's good and it's somewhat informative in a sense.  I recommend it if you have interest in the ""Freaks"".  All in all I would buy it again and recommend it but, if you are looking for top drawer entertainment this ain't it kid.  I laughed mostly but, felt deep empathy for the Hilton Sisters due to having previously viewed Bound by Flesh and had a good idea of the type of life that they were destined to live while Chained to each other for Life.  The Siamese Twins or the two headed Bette and Dot Tattler in AHS Freak Show is the cinematic reincarnation of the Hilton Sisters and if you are into Freak Show then you should find and watch both Bound by Flesh and Chained for life.  I bought a copy for a friend and he loved it also.",1420329600,,1130,4.175115207373272

1247519,4,B00001YXEN,"Interesting and good movie.  The twins lived later years in Charlotte, NC, where I now live.  I had heard of them but they died before I moved here.  They didn't let being Siamese Twins stop them from living a rather full life.  They were perfect for their roles in this movie,",1391731200,,277,4.372549019607843
1247520,4,B00001YXEN,"I don't think we can apply today's sorry moral standards  to 1951. I was shocked to discover that this pitiful duo really did exist. The movie is serious and well made if one views it with  fascination for the people in it. There  are some fine songs sung by the sisters.  They really had vocal talent. They might  have been classic performers if supported by Hollywood star makers.
There are several fine vaudeville acts by a very talented man.
  It's not modern entertainment by any means; but it has a certain beauty and pathos that's worth a few bucks if you have feeling for long gone people and cinema.",1383782400,2,608,4.522935779816514
1247521,5,B00001YXEN,"You MUST read The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton before watching this movie.  It makes it so special.  These were such talented, worthy sisters that were abused by their managers/family throughout their entire lives.  The book mentions this movie, so I purchased it.  Absolutely incredible.",1367280000,4,302,5.229166666666667
1247522,3,B00001YXEN,"I found this movie quite fascinating, primarily because it shows the mature Hilton Siamise Twins--Violet and Daisy--in their later years, long after their appearance in the l932 MGM film, ""Freaks.""

For a grindhouse exploitation movie, the production values are higher than usual, with a fairly large cast, different sets and flattering photograph of the two stars. However, this is what is so depressing about this effort: both women look like they're well into their 40s or early 50s.

Neither can act, since their vaudeville act was always just the two of them singing bland, forgettable songs. in fact, the movie often looks like an Ed Sullivan variety show--with endless and boring vaudeville acts. The male lead is so smarmy and sleazy that it's no wonder he vanished soon after the movie finally appeared in very limited showings.

Because of various legal battles and because the twins sunk all their small fortune into making this movie, Daisy and Violet ended up in poverty. they were so certain this movie would catapult them into major stardom which may indicate how totally out of touch they were from reality.

This movie was among the 20 in the fantastic boxed collection from Mill Creek called 20 Cult movies. You watch this one and the others and can appreciate more what the Hilton girls were trying to accomplish. When they died in poverty and obscurity, they were probably certain they had been forgotten. With the advent of home video, however, they're now being seen today and even appreciated.  After watching them in this effort, one has to admit that it's been like watching two, rather boring, housewives who somehow found themselves in front of a camera. One wishes they had somehow found understanding spouses and settled down somewhere and left the stage while at the top of their game.",1238025600,4,1815,4.957236842105263
1247523,2,B00001YXEN,"The quality of the film ""Chained for Life"" is certainly among the worst that I have ever viewed.  The picture is washed out and choppy.  One may wonder why the time has not been taken to restore this bit of sideshow/vaudeville history.  According to the excellent biography ""The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton,"" this is the film that finally ruined them.  The Hilton Sisters had high hopes that this project would make them superstars.  They paid almost all of their own money to produce this story about one twin committing homicide and the legal problems  the situation would cause.  ""Must the innocent be punished with the guilty, or should the guilty go free?""  This idea lost focus even before the first day of its filming.  After rewrites and reediting to please the censors of the day, ""Chained for Life"" became a blur of ideas with no real conclusion and unknown bad actors.  It is an uneven film, with no real plot, and out of place musical performances by Daisy and Violet.

The film was locked in litigation, upon it completion, for a year (due to unpaid production bills).  ""Chained for Life"" ended up with a very limited release in hick towns where small audiences hated the film.  The Hilton Sisters traveled from cheap theaters to drive-ins across the country trying to promote their film.  In the end, Daisy and Violet  took a tremendous financial loss.  This was the beginning of the final end for the Hilton Sisters.  They would never recover from the financial loss caused by this venture and would end up living their remaining years in poverty.

The DVD ""Chained for Life"" is cheap label discount release(Alpha).  It is a washed out, bad print of the high hopes that ended up being the final ruin of Daisy and Violet Hilton.  It is a bad film, and a sad ending to the once famous vaudeville headliners whose lives ended in tragedy.  Those who have read ""The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton: A True Story of Conjoined Twins by Dean Jensen,"" may find the DVD interesting for historical reasons. Those who know nothing of the Hilton Sisters will only see ""Chained for Life"" as a cinematic failure.",1196380800,11,2138,4.67828418230563
1247524,2,B00001YXEN,"There were two reasons I bought this DVD, one being that I'm very interested in ""Sideshow Freaks"", so I really wanted to see the sisters. The other that I really wanted to know how they would punish the other sister in the movie.

But there is no ending, there's just a man that simply tells you that you have to decide for yourself what you think the punishment should be.

Very dissapointing!

The acting isn't very good, especially not the sisters. The blonde one sounds bored when she should say ""I'm so happy!"".

The good parts were the performances on stage, I especially thought the guy on the bicicle was cool.

The sisters singing is good, it's so sad that the sound quality was so bad!

The plot was good, even though the sisters didn't act good, it did told how hard it can be to always be stuck together.",1180396800,4,816,4.406666666666666
1247525,1,B00001YXEN,"This DVD release is mastered from a VHS dub copy of a 16mm dupe print, so no wonder the sound is horribly distorted (as many have pointed out), and the detail of the picture is washed out. You can see the squiggly videotape artifacts from the minute the opening credits start. In brighter scenes, you can barely see any detail of some of the characters' faces (this is evidence that the original source was a dupe of a positive print rather than a positive print made from a negative) and this probably explains the poor sound as well. Then, the dub to videotape further degraded the quality. If Alpha Video couldn't come up with better source material, they should've passed on this title. Considering this film's obscurity, I wasn't expecting miracles, but this is one of the worst DVD releases I've come across. Avoid.",1178409600,10,821,4.708333333333333
1247526,2,B00001YXEN,"To the voyueristic among you yearning for a peep at the sex life of siamese twins, don't believe the hype on the box. Sizzleless exploiter featuring the Hilton sisters (of Freaks fame), posed as a courtroom drama centering on wether a judge can sentence both sisters for a murder only one comitted. Yes, there's the obligitory square up at the end, as silly as any of em. The dream sequence is sufficeintly weird, with Daisy being stunt doubled except for her close ups peeking through the tree. Oh, and there's a bumbling plate juggler, an organ played by rifle shots and a blind preacher waxing boringly about nature not ""granting favors"". The Hiltons sing a few songs. Besides that, the sound is atrocious and the print ain't much butter...er, better. Intrigued by this film after seeing Freaks? So was I. It didn't fail to disappoint. Not a total disaster, but not really worthwhile either.",1153353600,6,894,4.811688311688312

7915038,1,B00001YXEN,"Daisy & Violet Hilton were really in their wilted-salad days when they
made this catastrophe. The plot was weak, the acting anemic, and the
twins recited their dialogue as if they were talking in their sleep. The
only reason I bought this film was because it's the only movie that
features the twins throughout the entire feature, as opposed to their
on & off spots in ""Freaks.""",1437609600,,378,4.656716417910448

7915040,1,B00001YXEN,"Some people might be interested in the Hilton Sisters because of the recent Broadway revival of ""Side Show""--a musical somewhat based on their lives.  At this writing, you can see a more complete, better quality version of this movie for free on YouTube.  The quality of this DVD is so low that it is unwatchable.  Also, though described as the full 81-minute movie, the copy on this DVD is a butchered 65-minutes in duration--even shorter than the version on YouTube (69-minutes).  Save your money, save the plastic, save the paper, save the effort--and don't buy this DVD.",1430438400,,574,4.88659793814433

7915043,3,B00001YXEN,"""Chained For Life"" is an interesting film, loosely based on the life of the two co-joined twins ( the Hilton Sisters ) who starred in it. Most of the film deals with the problems two people face when they are physically joined for life. That is the most interesting part of the film and makes it worth watching. What to do when one of them commits murder makes for a somewhat interesting story that falls flat: can you punish the guilty twin without punishing the innocent one?
 While the Hilton Sisters might have been celebrities of a sort at one time, it's clear that they cannot act. The technical  quality of the video isn't great; it seems to have been taken directly from an old, degrading film print and not spruced up for dvd. The film itself was done on a shoestring budget, financed by the Hilton Sisters themselves. It was poorly received, and they lost their shirts on it.
Still, it was a unique idea.",1422144000,,914,4.5
