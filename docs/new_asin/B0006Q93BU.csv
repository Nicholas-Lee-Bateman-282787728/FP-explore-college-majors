2191261,5,B0006Q93BU,"TAXI the complete 2nd season (widescreen format) includes 4 discs packaged nicely in individual plastic cases.  Christopher Lloyd joins the cast in the 3rd episode.

DISC ONE
LOUIE AND THE NICE GIRL: Louie hits a new low when he gets a girlfriend and begins boasting about their sex life.  But Louie's girlfriend (Rhea Perlman) is singing a different song.  A double-Emmy winning episode.

HONOR THY FATHER: In a touching episode inspired by Director James Burrow's own life, Alex has a surprising reaction to the news that his father is dying.  Jack Gilford and Joan Hackett guest star.

REVEREND JIM: A SPACE ODYSSEY: Elaine and Bobby conspire to get Jim a job as a cabbie, but two things stand in the way: Louie and the drivers' test.  Includes the legendary ""Slow Down"" scene that made Christopher Lloyd an instant star.

NARDO LOSES HER MARBLES: Elaine's stressful job at the art gallery has kept her away from the crew, but after breaking down at an important opening, she turns to Alex for more than a shoulder to cry on.

WHEREFORE ART THOU, BOBBY?: Bobby reconsiders his acting ambitions when a newcomer he has befriended lands a Broadway role on his second day in the city.

THE LIGHTER SIDE OF ANGELA MATUSA: Angela Matusa, the mean far-from-lean date who ditched Alex in Season 1 is back and worse than ever.  Because this time, she's in love.

DISC TWO
A WOMAN BETWEEN FRIENDS: Alex is forced to mediate a messy love triangle when Tony and Bobby fall for the same woman ... and she falls for both of them.

THE GREAT RACE: Upset about their low earnings, Louie challenges the cabbies to a contest.  With hundreds of dollars and a date with Elaine at stake, the gang nominates Alex to compete against the hilariously unscrupulous Louie.

THE APARTMENT: When Latka's building is torn down, he foolishly spends his life's savings on one month's rent in a swank penthouse.  But the apartment proves to have unforeseen charms that are worth the price.  Dick Butkus guest stars.

ALEX'S ROMANCE: Alex enters his own private soap opera when he bails Bobby out of a bad date with a flighty actress.  Dee Wallace Stone (E.T.) guest stars.

LATKA'S REVOLTING: Latka's national pride -and impressive military rank- propels him toward home after revolution breaks out in his native land.

ELAINE'S SECRET ADMIRER: In an attempt to raise Elaine's spirits after her latest break-up, an anonymous admirer writes her a pair of peoms that turn out to be an unexpected turn-on.

DISC THREE
LOUIE MEETS THE FOLKS: Louie bribes Alex to accompany him to meet his girlfriend's parents, a minister and his mild-mannered wife.  But even Alex can't save Louie from himself - or from the minister's wife.

JIM GETS A PET: With inimitable logic, Reverend Jim blows $10,000 on an aging racehorse and then decides to keep it in his apartment as a family pet.

THE RELUCTANT FIGHTER: Tony has to battle his conscience when he's pitted against a boxer who's fighting on behalf of a wheelchair-bound boy.  Danza's son Marc Anthony Danza plays the youngster.

TONY AND BRIAN: An engaging orphan wins Tony's heart, but the adoption process threatens to break it when Tony must compete with a wealthy couple for the boy's affection.

GUESS WHO'S COMING FOR BREFNISH: Latka's love life is foiled by prejudice when he meets Simka, a beautiful woman from his homeland who defies his expectations.  Carol Kane's first appearance in her Emmy-winning role.

WHAT PRICE BOBBY?: Bobby must choose between integrity and success when a powerful agent makes him her latest casting-couch conquest.

DISC FOUR
SHUT IT DOWN PART 1: Elaine is elected shop steward in a labor dispute, which might require some creative negotiations with lascivious Louie.

SHUT IT DOWN PART 2: Luie finally gets his date with Elaine, and TV audiences get the kiss they can never forget.  A classic comedy moment.

ALEX JUMPS OUT OF AN AIRPLANE: After a death-defying adventure, Alex vows to confront every one of his fears.  While his friends try to talk him out of it, Louie figures a way to profit from Alex's recklessness.

ART WORK: Elaine convinces the cabbies to pool their money and buy a valuable painting as an investment.  But to raise the cash, they'll have to make a deal with the devil - Louie.

FANTASY BOROUGH PART 1: When Tony meets Fantasy Island's Herve Villechaize, it inspires the cabbies to describe their fantasies: Tony impresses Eric Sevareid (in a guest appearance), Latka lords it over Louie, and Jim finds his place in the world - or at least the universe.

FANTASY BOROUGH PART 2: The fantasies continue as Alex finally overcomes his inhibitions, Louie humiliates Lassie, and Elaine transforms the entire garage with a show-stopping Broadway song-and-dance.",1333843200,,4730,4.89321608040201

2191264,4,B0006Q93BU,"I LOVE Taxi, and each season gets better.  BUT, this particular DVD has TOO MUCH ADVERTISING!  It was maddening.  I popped in the DVD to watch an ep. of Taxi, but had to sit through THREE (3)! advertisements of Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, and Mork and Mindy ""now on DVD""!  I don't care!  I could not fast forward through them either.  I will NOT buy any more Paramount DVD sets if this is what is on them. It's not worth the frustration.",1248393600,3,442,4.265060240963855
2191265,5,B0006Q93BU,"Hilarious show, great cast and wonderful story lines.  What I loved about this show was everyone was allowed the opportunity to shine.  Nowadays they'll have a funny character then the next thing you know, the show slowly but surely revolves around that one person.  I can't stand when that happens.  This show is a about collective group.  They were very impressive.  Although I have to admit Latka and Louie are my favorites. It makes a great gift to anyone who loves classic 80's TV shows",1241740800,2,491,4.7176470588235295
2191266,5,B0006Q93BU,"The first season of Taxi was fantastic. Right away, the show's creators seemed to have a great sense of the characters, their relationships, and how the episodes would be structured. Somehow, as great as it was, season two manages to be a vast improvement! The key is perhaps the addition of Rev. Jim as a full-time cast member. It was quite a risk for a show with a character as unique as Latka Gravis to add another completely off-the-wall character to the group, but the drug-addled 60s leftover only adds to the perfect group dynamic and gets some of the biggest laughs I can remember. Who could forget the Rev. Jim asking what to do at a yellow light during his driving test?

Tony's a lovable dope, Bobby is spot-on as a frustrated actor, Louie's the guy you love to hate, and Elaine provides the garage with some real class. But anchoring everything is the great Judd Hirsch. Not without his own quirks, he's nevertheless the sane center of a crazy world.

If you like your sitcoms to be both intelligent and funny, Taxi's an absolute must-see, and season two is as good as they come.",1217203200,,1091,4.561224489795919
2191267,5,B0006Q93BU,"I was a young teen when TAXI first hit the airwaves. It was ""must see TV"" for me then and watching the shows now is no different. The writing is top notch but it's the cast that gets you hooked. What a terrific group of talented actors. One of the best casting jobs in TV history. Let's not forget that several future stars of Cheers had small parts TAXI in one or more episodes. I laugh each time I watch these shows. It's classic TV and Rev. Jim rules!!!!",1206316800,3,457,4.146067415730337

2191274,5,B0006Q93BU,"""Seinfeld"" has long been my all-time favorite sitcom. Since viewing the early episodes of ""Taxi"" Jerry and his pals somehow pale by comparison. More than two decades old now, that series avoided the silliness and reliance or unsubtle sexual or toilet humor of today. It perfectly melded very funny material with pungent reality. The second season gives us icing on the cake with the permanent return of ""Reverend Jim"" Ignatowski (Christopher Lloyd).",1124323200,,449,5.25

2191276,5,B0006Q93BU,"I never saw ""Taxi"" until Nick@Nite was showing them and I fell in love with it.  I managed to get most of them on VHS but all the episodes were out of order and the tapes took up so much room.  I want them to release all the other episodes too so I can finally junk these worn out tapes!  The best part of these discs is being able to see scenes that I never saw before.  If you ask me, these have to be the full shows because the versions that Nick was rerunning didn't have so many lines and moments that I now get to see.  And I don't know which tape I have it on, but there is probably an episode from later on where Jim does something notable with a hat but it can't be the one where he joins the garage because that doesn't make any sense.  Oh, and I watched the episode again and the reason the audience laughs is because of the punchline he delivers as he puts the hat on.  When he crashes the cab with Alex in the back seat I still LOL!  And don't get me started on that drivers ed test routine.  Whoever thought that up is a genius!!

Come on, guys, get seasons three to five out soon!!!  I'm dying to see the episodes where Simka marries Latka and then goes crazy with PMS (""PEEL ME LIKE A GRAPE!"").",1119139200,4,1210,3.979253112033195
2191286,5,B0006Q93BU,"I was editing for television in the mid 70s and into the late 80s and the idea that any network would allow a sitcom to run longer than 25 minutes back then is absolutely rediculous.  Although I never personally worked on ""Taxi"" I can assure you that the episodes in both season collections are the full ep's.  27 minutes long?  LOL!  No way!

I love how these amazon ""reviews"" are supposed to inform other buyers about product, but end up getting used for various misguided rants by people who don't know what they're saying.  I would bet dollars to donuts that the person who has gotten him or herself worked up believing that they've been ripped off from missing Louie DePalma dialogue is responsible for these multiple postings by allegedly different people warning the entire world that Jim's hat and 3 extra minutes have been snatched from us in some diabolical plot to rip off consumers.

Furthermore, not every series stuck to the ""always must have a tag scene"" rule.  ""Taxi"" sometimes did and sometimes didn't have a tag scene before the closing credits.  The Norman Lear shows were like that as well (had the pleasure of working for that crowd back in the day, incidentally).  And sometimes shows had to be cut for time before they even aired for the first time.  ""Taxi"" had a rough look to it and often in their first-run broadcasts the episodes WOULD look like something was cut.  Well, that's because it WAS.  But it landed on the cutting room floor long before the public had the pleasure of seeing it for the first time.

Don't know how much more plainly I can spell this out, but if CBS (or whoever) dictates that you can only run 24:35, for example, and you have a total running time of 26:17, then you won't be going home until you've shaved off a total of 1:48.  And you weren't always blessed with the same amount of time each week.  If ABC (or whoever) demands that you cut an extra minute off so they can promo something else, you do it.  Whether or not any of that cut-before-it-could-air footage is salvaged was/is up to whoever was running the show, and it wasn't/isn't consistent from one guy to the next.

Leave it to someone who's obviously never worked in the industry to proclaim what the rules are.

Amazing.

Folks, I bought both ""Taxi"" sets.  All are excellent, and all are about as complete as they could ever be.  ABC, NBC and CBS were not letting half hour comedies run longer than 24:30 or 25:00 because ad time was - and still is - way too precious.  If you're convinced that you should be seeing at least 27 minutes of material in each episode then you're kidding yourself.",1118966400,40,2612,4.534188034188034
2191287,5,B0006Q93BU,"The reviewer who said that this set was complete is right.  Syndicated reruns never looked or sounded this good, and there are no scenes missing.  Jim never got a hat as a congratulations for becoming a cab driver.  He got keys to a cab and a handshake.  That scene is intact in the episode I affectionately call ""What Does A Yellow Light Mean?!""  There might be a moment in a later episode where Jim is given a hat for some reason, but it doesn't happen in that episode.  I just wish there were some interviews or outtakes... SOMETHING!  Oh well, can't complain about what's here though.  Season 3 comes out in September (says tvshowsondvd.com) so I can't wait!",1118793600,14,662,4.5508474576271185
2191288,5,B0006Q93BU,"""Taxi"" is one of the all time greats. Any show that featured Andy Kaufman's ""Latka"" and Chris Lloyd's ""Jim Ignatowski"" has to be a classic. Add the always down to earth and idealisic Alex Reiger, and of course Danny Devitos's one of a kind ""Louie DePalma"" and how can you go wrong?

Ensemble comedies with smart writing are rare. ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". ""Cheers"" ""Seinfeld"" and ""Frasier"" come to mind to add to ""Taxi"". The show was never a huge hit,but had respectable ratings. Some of the shows turned downright bizarre near the end of it's run.

I thought Season 3 would be out already. Whats the delay? It would be nice to have some extras, but I suppose this is not the case.",1117670400,7,684,4.464
2191289,1,B0006Q93BU,"I just received my boxed set. I cannot say how dissapointed I was to discover that this is the cut up syndicated version.

I feel ripped off. The crucial and touching scene where the Reverend Jim is presented with his cabbie hat is just one of the cut out scenes.  They should be required to state that this is not the original released versions.

2191290,5,B0006Q93BU,"the first time i saw this t.v. show i was, very pleased with it, because it had so many good actors, some were already known and others were staring their careers (like tony danza), we all know that taxi takes place in N.Y.C. in the late 70's, in a cab station called Sunshine Cabs. and that it featured some of the funniest characters in sitcom histoy, like Andy and in this second season comes the reverend (christopher lloyd), so if you're looking for some old fashioned comedy you can't go wrong with this box set trust me.  (sabor!!!)",1114646400,,539,4.5
2191291,5,B0006Q93BU,"With its acerbic humor and quirky characters, Taxi is widely considered one of the funniest sitcoms in television history. Created by James L. Brooks (whose magic hand played a role in such hits as The Andy Griffith Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and The Simpsons), Taxi maintains a loyal following to this day via syndicated reruns. Sporting an all-star cast, the show introduced the world to the comedic talents of such superstars as Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Marilu Henner, Andy Kaufman, and Christopher Lloyd...

Taxi follows the inner-workings of the Sunshine Cab Company, a New York City taxicab operation run by an insulting and tyrannical dispatcher named Louie De Palma (Danny DeVito). De Palma's onerous tactics are dispensed from the safety of his small office ""cage"" in the corner of the body shop, while various cab drivers such as Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsch), Tony Banta (Danza), and Elaine Nardo (Henner) associate with one another. Throw in foreign mechanic Latka Gravas (Kaufman), and all the ingredients are in place for endless hours of laughter. As the characters perform their numerous runs, meet back at the shop, and deal with varying problems in their personal lives, audiences are treated to some of the best comedy ever to grace the small screen...

The Taxi (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Louie and the Nice Girl"" in which Zena (Rhea Pearlman), a woman who refills the vending machines (and a friend of most of the cabbies), reveals to Alex and Elaine that she has a crush on Louie. When the two begin dating, Louie boats of their sexual escapades, but Zena tells the gang that nothing has happened. Confronted, Louie admits that he doesn't know what to do with a ""nice girl"" like Zena, at least until he learns that Zena might not be the nice girl he once thought... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Wherefore Art Thou, Bobby?"" in which Bobby quits his dream of becoming an actor after a young protg lands a job on his first try, and ""Jim Gets a Pet"" in which Jim wins $10,000 at a race track and uses the winnings to purchase the long shot horse on which he bet...

2191292,5,B0006Q93BU,"Even though this season has the introduction of Jim, Danny De Vito is incredible this season.

I love Danny De Vito.  He is very amazing and very inspirational.  I'm totally amazed at how much he has been able to accomplish.

They say that the strength of a movie is determined by how well the bad guy performs his role.  That makes a lot of sense with movies like Terminator, Star Trek II, the Matrix, and I'm sure there are some non-sci-fi examples, too.  But, I think that Danny De Vito performs Louie perfectly.  You like him and you despise him at the same time.  You understand his motives and you feel sorry for him sometimes, but he's always consistent, and you always cheer when someone one-ups him.

Danny was excellent this season in the episodes with Zena, the Shut it Down episodes, and Fantasy Borough.",1113264000,2,816,4.572413793103448
2191293,3,B0006Q93BU,"A method actor is a very deranged person in real life. Method actors crazily feel they can't play a character unless they figure out that character's motivation! Also, method actor's often really hit other actors (or the method actor gets hit himself or herself) in a scene instead of just faking the hit. This can result in serious bodiy harm. Furthermore, a method actor often does crazy things like staying up late for real just so they'll appear tired. And lastly, method actors often really put themselves into the mood of their characters and they can't easily get out of their character's mood once the director yells ""cut"". Remember all this when you watch Christopher Lloyd in the second season oif Taxi and on so you don't admire his performance as Reverend Jim too much.",1111968000,2,781,4.792592592592593
2191294,5,B0006Q93BU,"Taxi's second season was one of it's best seasons, but if you were to buy it just for the episode where Reverend Jim takes his driver's license test - it would totally be worth the price!

Sexy Elaine Nardo(Marilu Henner) is still catching the eyes of girl-hungry guys. She's still driving just like Alex Rieger(Judd Hirsch),Bobby Wheeler(Jeff Conaway),Tony Banta(Tony Danza) and Latkas Gratvas(the late Andy Kaufman).",1106611200,2,403,5.8474576271186445
