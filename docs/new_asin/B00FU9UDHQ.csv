Then my husband met someone who swore it was hilarious, so we tried again. The first episode was clearer, but still a bit trashy.
But later.....we roared.  There are some hilarious things in this show, funny & strange characters, and lots of surprises.  No Hollywood formula here.  Lots of memorable lines and favorite scenes.  Love when we first meet Smithies' sister.  Classic!  Anyway, get past episode one & I think, like us, this show will not only grow on you, but stick with you.  I'm not out to find more done by these writers and actors.",1444867200,,664,4.475
8618633,1,B00FU9UDHQ,"No, I'm not sure if every blu ray player is the same, but I have a Sony , it's a brand new model, it doesn't play on it, I've contacted the seller, he sent me a list of compatible players- and told me if I wanted to return it I would be charged a restocking fee- so pretty much I'm out the money , not satisfied",1434931200,2,311,3.727272727272727
8618634,1,B00FU9UDHQ,This item does not work on a Sony blu ray player in the US and should have been noted in the product description.  Besides having to pay the return shipping I'm being charged to reseal the item!  How would we have known it didn't work without opening?  The shipper actually suggested we should buy a separate blu ray player so we could use the item!  Very disappointing and I will not be using this shipper again.,1422403200,,413,4.394736842105263

8618636,1,B00FU9UDHQ,This order was a Christmas gift that disappointed us.  The type of blu ray disc will not play on a standard US blu ray player so we can't use the video series.,1419638400,,159,3.96875
