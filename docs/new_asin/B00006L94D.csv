It has amazing footage, some of the best riders out there, a great soundtrack, and cool and humorous bonus features.  For sure if you have any interest in snowboarding this is the way to go.  In fact, I had watched this video and I didn't even snowboard, but because if the video I started snowboarding...yeah it's that good. it's a decent price too.",1177977600,,453,4.433734939759036
8557547,5,B00006L94D,"This was an amazing video! Starting with a cool intro, including a backflip on a snowmobile and some good background music, this video dove right into some awsome tricks. I highly recomend if you like snowboarding, or snow, you get this video!

Does anyone have a playlist for this video?",1121644800,,288,4.76
