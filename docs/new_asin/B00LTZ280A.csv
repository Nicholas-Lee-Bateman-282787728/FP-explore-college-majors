6506281,5,B00LTZ280A,This works out great as an advent devotional.  My family watched 10 minute segments each night and all of us were touched by it.,1481846400,,128,4.333333333333333
6506282,5,B00LTZ280A,Wonderful insight into the birth and life of Christ and those involved in His earthly life.,1479513600,,91,4.75
6506283,3,B00LTZ280A,I liked it but my children got bored. It is not for children.,1478476800,,61,3.769230769230769
6506284,5,B00LTZ280A,"Really good Christmas stories and biblical teachings from Max Lucado who is a master at telling a good story making it feel as if you were right there with Mary, Joseph and little baby Jesus. Max tells the Bible stories in peaceful settings around British churches and churchyards. Wonderful series.",1477958400,,299,5.0
6506285,5,B00LTZ280A,The greatest story ever told in basic language for the little ones!,1471219200,,67,4.666666666666667

6506287,2,B00LTZ280A,"There aren't very many options for Advent themed, Adult curriculum. So, I tried this. It is pieces of some longer project patched together into six too-long sessions. It is boring and repetitive--there are actually segments used more than once in the patchwork. Some interesting history (Saint Nicolas), but mostly just a long series of questions that try to get you into the perspective of Mary and Joseph. Too many questions at once, with no time to process really. All in all, it's not well suited for Adult Sunday School and definitely not suited for use at home with the kids. Not much effort was put into the production, so it's monotonous.",1452816000,,646,4.828828828828829
6506288,2,B00LTZ280A,I really didn't expect someone reading a book on video.  Boring.,1444867200,4,64,4.818181818181818
6506289,4,B00LTZ280A,"Profound insights into the marvelous grace of the incarnation with the superb articulation and creative expression Lucado is known for!  This was shown in a Church Bible study group in the weeks leading up to Christmas and was such a blessing that many wanted to see it again in their homes.  This copy was purchased as a Christmas gift for a couple who couldn't attend the study sessions, and the recipients were thrilled.",1424217600,,423,4.780821917808219

6506291,4,B00LTZ280A,I think that it was inspirational.  Best to only listen to once session at a time.  Excellent questions to ponder.,1482710400,,114,4.65

8668063,5,B00LTZ280A,Beautifully done. Best to use it daily during the Advent season as it is more meaningful used in that way.

I will use this series for years to come at Advent time.,1483401600,,304,4.446428571428571
8668064,3,B00LTZ280A,Max Lucado is a wonderful story teller and he really shares some heart-warming stories about Jesus. The only problem with this story is the narrative is unnecessarily chopped up into odd segments.,1483315200,,196,5.15625
