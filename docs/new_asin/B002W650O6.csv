8510632,2,B002W650O6,"I lived in Puerto rico in the '80s and immediately dated this to that era. Filmed in 1989, released in 2009. It does cover many of the tourist spots, but there are way better and more recent Puerto Rico videos.",1512777600,,210,4.275

8510635,5,B002W650O6,"I use this video to introduce my Spanish 2 class to the history and culture of Puerto Rico.  Doesn't matter that it's dated because it's about history!  I had an old VHS tape of the same video and can't use it anymore, but I made a quiz to go with it several years ago and I can use the same quiz!  Score! Contact me if you want a copy of my quiz!

I stop the video at about 18:00 because the rest is just a commercial for traveling to P. R.",1400025600,,441,3.8131868131868134
8510636,1,B002W650O6,"I just visited Puerto Rico for Christmas, and decided to see what travel TV shows on Amazon Prime Instant Video have to say about this great travel destination. This program is extremely dated, it should be listed under historic. Although, information provided by the female voice-over sounds correct, the cinematography and editing made the show looks like an old corporate video from the 80s.

I am sorry to say it, but I've seen better videos made with iPhones posted on YouTube by kids from their trips to PR.",1388275200,,513,4.829545454545454
8510637,3,B002W650O6,"As the other review for this video noted, this video is becoming dated.  Despite that, it still has some value.  It's not the best travel video I have ever seen but it was not a waste of time either.  If you have Amazon Prime, it is free so give it a shot.",1368057600,,256,3.8846153846153846
8510638,2,B002W650O6,"The year indicates 2009, but this must have originally been shot in the 1980's based on the clothing, hair styles and cars shown.  It is poor quality and very, very out of date.  Not worth $1.99...",1347840000,,197,4.444444444444445
8510639,1,B002W650O6,I rented this to learn about Puerto Rico for an upcoming trip. It was like a filmstrip from when I was in middle school. The footage was grainy and looked as if it was filmed in the early 1980's. It is horribly out of date. I cannot recommend this.,1310860800,,248,4.081632653061225
8510640,1,B002W650O6,"Very disappointed with this.  Bought for current information about Puerto Rico and found it to be very much out of date. The quality was extremely poor also, grainy, indistinct. I would not recommend this product for information on Puerto Rico for anyone.",1269648000,2,255,5.071428571428571
