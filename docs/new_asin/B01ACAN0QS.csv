7597680,5,B01ACAN0QS,"As I'm getting older, I find change difficult. Losing three of the four principal characters in a series, especially Camille and Fidel, seemed too big change to me. I liked both of them. Losing the first inspector from the first two series was unsettling, but he was too much like MONK to seem original. And his passing was creative. Kris Marshall won me over slowly, clumsy like Jim Hutton's Ellery Queen (which I guess is supposed to make him endearing - Hutton did it better) but brilliant in detection. Unlike some other reviewers, I like the 'great reveal' at the end - it explains what clues I missed. In season 5 the new team seemed to gel - thank God for Dwayne who is the one link to all the series and a really original character for a police procedural. I liked him the best anyway (I hope they are not thinking of moving him to somewhere). I like the 'rookie' who is finding his own self as a policeman and so is a better foil for Dwayne than Fidel. The Commissioner has gotten a stronger part and I like him but the writers don't seem to have a solid idea of who he is - a politician? a policeman? a good boss? a boss that doesn't work much?. He always seems to have loads of free time. I also wonder why Catherine never mentions her daughter - you would think Humphrey (terrible name) would ask about Camille once in a while. Florence, the policewoman, does not have charisma of Camille. She could be any office worker anywhere. But this team of four now seems like four people who know what they're doing on the job and can take time out to have fun together. The plots are creative - when I first started watching this show I wondered how many murders you could have on an island - the answer is an infinite number. And last but not least - the island itself - beaches, ocean, palm trees, warm winds, colorful buildings, interesting people - watching this is like going on vacation, only you get to go practically everywhere on the island - jungle, resorts, rich man's houses, markets. The only drawback is you don't get to taste the food or have an exotic cocktail. Sit back and relax. This series is definitely worth owning.",1503014400,,2142,4.411616161616162

7597712,4,B01ACAN0QS,A few reused plot notions... but then again the homicide rate on this little island makes Detroit look like the Garden of Eden so all that's left is the sheer enjoyment of watching the characters make the script better than it is.

What you might not know, if you're living outside of Europe is that there will be more changes to the cast. I will shut up now for fear of spoiling it for you. All-in-all, it's an entertaining show.",1490659200,,319,4.161290322580645

7597792,5,B01ACAN0QS,"Just can't wait for Season 6.  Although one of the characters disappeared from the series with no real explanation (which was disappointing), it is well done and in spite of the always forecasted outcome it now picks up on the lives of the individuals to make it more interesting.",1485302400,,280,4.714285714285714
7597793,5,B01ACAN0QS,"One of my favorite shows -- I love the characters although I still miss Camille. I actually enjoy the formula - I don't find it over done or tedious.  Good stories and like the scenery.  I find the British how-done-its much better than the American shows.  Great writing, well plotted, lovely scenery and quirky characters -- all this and nothing explodes, no gratuitous sex and violence.

If you are just coming to the Death in Paradise table I suggest you start with season1.",1485129600,4,477,4.710843373493976

7597814,5,B01ACAN0QS,"The real pull of this show is divided between the Caribbean scenery and the interaction of the characters.  The mysteries are clever but serve more to bring out the characters than pose real world mysteries.  Victims tend to die quickly and quietly.from injuries which, in realistic procedurals would  take longer, and leave the possibility of dying identifications.",1483142400,,366,5.385964912280702
7597815,5,B01ACAN0QS,"Sort of a British Columbo set on a tropical island, really one of the better detective shows on TV. Kris Marshall (Love, Actually) is great as DI Humphrey Goodman and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. Funny, entertaining and the scenery is beautiful. Trying to find it on PBS is difficult as sometimes it's on and sometimes not so get the DVD and binge watch it!!",1482969600,,372,4.405797101449275

7597818,5,B01ACAN0QS,I have loved this series since the first episode of the first season. It is only getting better and better. This season was wonderful and I would recommend this to anyone who loves a murder mystery and would like a vacation in Paradise.

7597823,5,B01ACAN0QS,"This is just a great little series. We've been fans since the first season and even as cast members came and left the quality and entertainment value has been retained. Very quirky, funny, and beautiful island setting. That said...be aware that the characters speak with French, Island, and British accents. I've never found them difficult but some people do. I'd recommend you watch one on Amazon Prime just to make sure. My grand daughter LOVES it and she's a freshman in college. So do my middle school age grand kids and all our adult children ask to watch it when they visit. Very well produced but it's British so I've come to expect high quality writing and this series does not disappoint.",1482019200,5,697,4.721311475409836
7597824,5,B01ACAN0QS,"This program never disappoints even with the change of major cast members. Who would have thought that losing the two lead characters would not kill the momentum and outright fun of this TV series.  Instead the show carries on without even a little hiccup. I can't imagine TV's other greatest program, Doc Martin, losing Caroline Catz and not hurting the show a great deal.  But here in ""paradise"" the loss of the incredibly beautiful actress Sara Martins and the fantastic actor Ben Miller should have been the end
of Death In Paradise. Low and behold Kris Marshall saves the day first and then while I'm still brooding the loss of Martins, Josephine Jobert makes my heart sing again.  Danny John-Jules is superb in his role as Dwayne Myers.  Pardon me for saying this, but I have to.......Danny is a jewel. I have the first four season on disc and will soon have the U.S. version of season 5.  By the way, the votes of those who have the wrong CD version of season 5 shouldn't count against the program as a whole.  Votes should only count when they post an opinion about the program itself.  This show deserves every five star rating it receives.  Like Doc Martin, this program is a refuge from most of trash available to us.",1481414400,3,1228,4.575342465753424
7597825,4,B01ACAN0QS,"No, it's not dark and brooding, but it's not meant to be, it's a bit of a goof.  Absolutely family friendly, the mysteries are light, done in the old style of lets gather all the suspects together for the unveiling of the culprit. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun, it's very entertaining. The characters, the mysteries, the setting, the lizard, all wonderfully Island-ly fun.  Yes, there is a lizard, (an Anole actually) that makes a cameo appearance on at least every other show. Love that thing, love to watch for him.  He's all CGI but you could never tell, he looks as real as they come.
If you're going to watch and never have, start with season one, each episode could stand on it's own, but it's so much better with all the background on the characters.",1480032000,,762,4.507246376811594

7597840,5,B01ACAN0QS,"Welcome back to the Caribbean island of Saint Marie and the Honore Police Department. The ""Chief"" is Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman, a British import.  His Detective Sergeant is Florence Cassell, ably assisted by JP Hooper and Dwayne. Dwayne makes the show  what a character. And in this season, it is nice to see a serious side of him, also.

D.I. Goodman, as played by Kris Marshall, is not quite the bumbler he was in prior seasons. He has gained confidence. In everything but his love life, that it. He is, as he puts it, on the lookout for ""Mrs. Humphry II"", and Dwayne and Florence do their best to help him.

It's interesting that Humphrey pronounces Florence's name ""floor AWNS""; in the U.S. we usually say ""FLOOR ents"". D.S. Cassell is French, and she is played by the French actress, Josephine Jobert. Season 4 of ""Death in Paradise"" was Jobert's first English-speaking acting role.

I count Series 5 as 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. Some of the dialogue is more-than-usually unrealistic, especially in how the police question a suspect. But I keep in mind that the ""Death in Paradise"" mysteries are closer to cozies than to police procedurals. For example, Humphrey likes to gather all the suspects together in one place when he makes the big reveal at the end of an episode.

Series 5 originally aired in January/February 2016. The 8 episodes total 472 minutes of mysteries (without commercials). English subtitles are available on the Region 1 DVD set. The DVDs have no Bonus Extras.

Neither the disc cases nor the episodes themselves have any episode titles (rather annoying). I'll use the unofficial titles from wikipedia.
....Episode 1 ""The Complex Murder"" Dan Hagen is a marine biologist leading a diving expedition to re-test the extent of coral bleaching on a Saint Marie reef. He stays on board while 4 divers, including his wife, gather samples. They're only in the water 40 minutes, but when they get back on the boat they find Hagen shot through the heart. And no body around who could have done it.
....Episode 2 ""One for the Road"" Saint Marie is governed by the British. After serving a 4-year term, Caroline Bamber is leaving as Governor. They throw her a farewell party at Government House. The Police Commissioner is there to pour Bamber a glass of champagne after her speech. After which she promptly dies. While the Commissioner is standing next to her still holding the champagne bottle. Awkward.
....Episode 3 ""Posing in Murder"" Nelson Benedict is a Saint Marie boy who made it big in the European fashion community. He comes back to the island to host a fashion show for a school fundraiser. The runway is set up on the beach and he has four models, two local and two imported, to show off his creations. It's all going well until one of the models is impossibly strangled.
....Episode 4 ""A Personal Murder"" Dwayne is impressive in his full dress uniform as a pall bearer. The deceased is Cedrik Verga, whose barbershop, as Dwayne says in his eulogy, was ""the hub of our community."" Cedrick meant the world to Dwayne. Which is why Dwayne takes it seriously when he receives a text from Cedrik after the funeral, saying, ""I WAS MURDERED.""
....Episode 5 ""Lost Identity"" Humphrey is happy when his beloved Aunt Mary comes to visit. He puts her up at the La Toubana Hotel, where she has a room on the 3rd floor. In the middle of the night, she's awakened by sounds and a scream next door. Being related to Humphrey, she has to get out of bed to investigate. Which is how she finds that a man was thrown from the balcony to his death.
....Episode 6 ""Dishing Up Murder"" Robert Holt, Michelin-starred chef, is opening a new restaurant in Saint Marie. Tonight is its ""soft"" grand opening, a trial run for selected guests before the real Grand Opening next week. It seems to go well, and the kitchen crew leave the restaurant exhausted at 11pm, leaving only Holt to mull over his menu. Unfortunately, when they return the next morning, it is to find the celebrated chef dead in the walk-in freezer. Is it a cold case?
In a side story, JP is in love. Humphrey's advice: ""You must remember what the ancients said about the art of love  once you have secured the battlefield, you must then massacre the enemy. Or was that the art of war?""
....Episode 7 ""The Blood Red Sea"" Tosh Walker, his wife, son and crewman are celebrating. Tosh gloats, ""For 400 years, this little lot has sat on the seabed just waiting to be discovered. And we did it!"" He's talking about the Santa Ana Silver,  300,000 worth of gold coins. Might be worth killing over.
Trivia: In this episode, you'll notice the lack of luminol in the Honore police department's arsenal.
....Episode 8 ""Flames of Love"" There is a beach party, dance and drink, into the night at the Saint Marie Youth Hostel. That's why it's a little off-kilter when Astor Henri, the hostel owner, stops Sian Evans, one of the young guests, to ask, ""I just want to know that we're cool, yeah? You promise you won't say anything?"" Well, she can't, can she, if she's dead.

A 6th season of ""Death in Paradise"" is in production, and will air in January 2017.

A better warning of where purchased media is coming from so that people know for sure that it is compatible with their media system would be very much appreciated.",1469232000,4,439,4.141176470588236

7597866,5,B01ACAN0QS,"My DVD player plays both region 2 (UK) and region 1 (US and Canada) DVD's, so these discs play perfectly for me, and this review is based entirely on content.  I love this series and all of the quirky characters that populate Saint Marie.  Although it seems unlikely that such a small island could host so many murders, the writers and actors of this series are superb, and I can hardly wait for the next episode. The writers respect the intelligence of their viewers and don't dumb-down their scripts, and I am especially in awe of the French-speaking actors and actresses who give outstanding performances in English, episode after episode.  Few series could survive the loss of major characters, but this show is dynamic and as some of the original cast members leave, new characters quickly take their places in the plot and in my heart.  My only complaints are (1) that the seasons are too short, and (2) it takes too long for them to become available on DVDs from the UK or on Amazon USA.",1464825600,16,994,4.598870056497175
7597867,5,B01ACAN0QS,"Wonderful British T.V. series.  DVD set is as described, plays perfectly.  The 1 star reviews are unfortunately misleading, as they are reviewing their mistake of buying a region 2 DVD, and trying to play it using a region 1 DVD player.",1464825600,28,236,4.7317073170731705
