8114788,5,B000EW5TMS,"I have most of the Gaither Homecoming videos or DVDs in my personal collection.  I can state uncategorically that this is the best to date!  This is SO enjoyable that I brought it to China with me, just to see it every day or so.  Ernie Haas and Signature Sound were introduced at this event.  Say no more!!  Wait until you hear Layde Love and Reggie Smith do a duet rendition of Josh Groban's ""He Lifts Me Up,"" and Signature Sound and the Gaither Vocal Band team up for a couple numbers.  This is just an utterly fantastic program, from ""stem to stern.""",1144195200,,554,4.330097087378641
