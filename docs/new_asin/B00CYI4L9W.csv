5751773,4,B00CYI4L9W,"A true classic show, from the days of great cartoons! Definitely one to be treasured.",1409184000,,85,4.733333333333333
5751774,5,B00CYI4L9W,This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid watching it on Nickeloden and now it's finally more episodes on dvd.,1400198400,,119,4.0
5751775,5,B00CYI4L9W,"One of if not the best cartoon to come out of the eighties, the first 22 cartoons from Inspector Gadget are great fun to revisit, and perfect to introduce your kids to. The lack of special features is, in my opinion, not enough to detract from the greatness of this series. Remember VHS? Four episodes per tape? Coming Atractions you couldn't skip past? What we wouldn't have given for something like this! An earlier set had some retrospective features, but they were kinda' dry anyway.
The first episode has some sound issues, but it's the only one. Frankly, Gadgets mustache in that episode is more distracting. All episodes look fine for their age, no worse than when originaly shown. Really, anyone who's ever enjoyed Gadget should get this set, or maybe even the complete Megaset.",1394841600,,786,4.82962962962963
5751776,2,B00CYI4L9W,"the picture quality is somewhat lacking and the sound cuts out on one episode. The episode Art Heist is missing a PSA. Besides that, this is an essential 80s classic. The episode ""The Boat"" has its title appear. If you remember your childhood days, not a single episode had it's title appear. The are also no extras! Each episode is self-contained and gets repetitive.",1386288000,2,368,4.765625
5751777,1,B00CYI4L9W,"I bought all of the individual sets since I didn't care if I got the movie that came with the megaset.  Unfortunately, the first episode of disc one of this set (Gadget in Winterland, the pilot episode) has some noticable audio glitches in the first part of the episode.  These authoring errors are not in the Shout! Factory volume 1 release.  I contacted the manufacturer about this issue, but they blew me off.",1382572800,4,412,4.616438356164384
5751778,2,B00CYI4L9W,"Inspector Gadget is an awesome show, and with these DVD sets that's exactly what you get --- Inspector Gadget.  And the show itself is awesome.  Can't take anything away from that, it's the classic cartoon about a cybernetic detective solving cases with his plucky, genius niece and their brave, disguise-wearing dog, fighting against the crimes of the evil Dr. Claw and his MAD organization.

That said, there are problems with this release.  Big problems.

First, the biggest glaring problem is the video quality.  Let me assure you, I'm not one of those video aficionados that gets worked up over small technical details, I just want to watch the show in a decent enough quality that at least looks normal.  So what can I say when the video actually has this weird stuttering throughout the entire show?  It's awful!  I almost couldn't believe my eyes, but it's definitely there.  The video actually 'floats' around up and down, left and right slightly throughout the ENTIRE show.  You'll see a still camera shot and you'll notice that the image is slightly moving in random directions.  It borders on making the show unwatchable, and I actually felt nauseous watching some of the episodes.  Not just that, but the colors all look washed out and darker than they ought to be.  It looks weird, like they took an unwashed window and placed it on top of the video, there's no vibrancy to the colors at all.  They really dropped the ball on this, and the funny thing is, at the beginning of every DVD they actually have a disclaimer that they force you to sit through: ""The footage that follows includes occasional audio and video imperfections inherent in the original master tapes.""  I've never seen something like that before on a classic video release, and it feels to me like all they're trying to do is excuse themselves for the visual problems they ought to have fixed.

Second, this is a bare bones release.  You want the show?  You got it...and that's all you're getting.  There are literally no extras on these DVDs, no inserts, not even settings or options in the DVD menu or anything.  You load the DVD, it gets to the main menu, and all you see is a ""Play All"" option and a listing of the episodes all on one screen.  That's it.  No funny animations, no background music --- they literally put the bare minimum effort into making this release.

Third, the production quality for the sets themselves is annoying.  I got all 4 DVD sets (because I didn't want the movie that came with the ultimate edition), and the DVD cases are cheap as all get-out.  You aren't going to believe me when I say this (I can hardly believe me when I say this), but all 4 cases I got were actually damaged, with plastic broken off on the outside of one box, the spine on another box ripping apart at the seam, and on the other 2 the little clasps that hold the cases shut were broken off, so basically two of my sets won't even close!  Not to mention, what's up with the art that they put on the DVD case?  On the back cover of each DVD, it looks like they took art from that 2002 movie ""Inspector Gadget's Last Case"", which looks nothing like the actual art from the classic TV series.  What in the world were they thinking?

A final minor gripe is the DVD opening, with all the studio names and fbi warning.  You can't skip any of it (I tried, lord knows I tried), and it lasts for like thirty seconds.  I hate it when companies force you to sit through that stuff, especially when it's 12 DVDs, it's annoying.

But again, it's Inspector Gadget.  The show is awesome.  But this release sure isn't.",1381536000,17,3589,4.528771384136858
