509403,5,6302746930,The first two minutes of this video had me rolling on the floor! Mr. Moore takes an average Joe look at how polititions and C.E.O.'s care about profits and campaign contributions over people's lives and  morals. Presentation (although a serious subject matter) is intellectualy  humorous....A MUST SEE!!!,911606400,,304,5.446808510638298

509434,3,6302746930,"While I commend Moore for talking about U.S. manufactoring going overseas to Mexico and Asia and his criticism of both political parties (including Bill Clinton) and corporations Moore lets his political agenda get in the way of a real issue in this film. The one good thing about this movie is this is his last (and only) good documentary that is not partisan and slams both parties on the trade issue. ""Roger and Me"" and all of his later films only criticize the Right on issues and ignore any criticism of the Left.",1413072000,,518,4.580645161290323

509436,5,6302746930,As always Michael Moore does it. Amy movie or documentary he puts out i watch. He goes so inside these topicd that others don't and we as people deserve these answers and need to know whats going on. Thank you Michael Moore,1399334400,,223,4.333333333333333
509437,3,6302746930,"The description says that all the episodes are ""complete and unedited"", but, that's not the case.  They're the edited syndication prints from the '80s that were seen on TBS and WGN.  They did include the epilogues that weren't included in the TV versions.  Maybe that's what they mean by ""complete and unedited.""  Aside from the epilogues, there are a few minutes cut from each episode.  The episodes do contain the original theme song, so, that's a plus.",1378512000,,455,4.857142857142857
509438,3,6302746930,I am a collector of Michael Moore's documentaries but I try to keep my ratings unbiased.  Moore has made some great movies and some not so outstanding.,1357430400,,151,4.592592592592593
509439,5,6302746930,"I really liked this one. I haven't seen everything Michael Moore has made or written but I like what I've seen so-far. Who else is out there, that we know of, who has brought these problems to light? Problems with Corporations who put money before people. Before I saw his movies I was lead to believe that Michael Moore was a ""Communist"", ""Hates his country"" and loves ""Dictators"", nothing could be further from the truth. I think he's an outstanding American and a funny one to -- I laughed a few times while watching him present awards to Public Relations people of big corporations, awards to the CEO's who have closed factories putting people out of work.",1349568000,,660,4.64957264957265
509440,1,6302746930,"It's an interesting look back when we first began losing jobs in the U.S. to other countries.  Too bad we didn't make more of an uproar about it back then.  Companies were making huge profits then and wanted more so they let slaves in other countries do the work. Those were the days when the companies just smiled at the workers being laid off and said we would be retrained to do other, better, higher paying jobs here in the U.S.  And 14 years later we're competing for $8 an hour in retail sales or fast food.",1319328000,2,513,4.268041237113402

509442,3,6302746930,"Well after seeing Bowling for columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11 I thought Michael Moore was funny and should run for president. I watched sicko and found it very boring and felt like i already knew having been raised in the United Kingdom that the US health care system was expensive and for a country that allows citizens to own guns they should also allow them to get medical attention for the gun shot wons. Sicko was interesting not funny or as entertaining though, it just made me want to live in another country. So i thought let me watch all Michael Moore's movies. Roger and Me was sadly still relevant after its release in 1989 but was funny and very good for his first film. Canadian Bacon was a funny John candy movie which made fun of politics but is PG. And the awful Truth tv series is like mini documentary's but the movies are better. AS for the Big One I found it funny however it was a bit random and just about how bad corporations are. Maybe if it was done today it would deal with Walmart and congress. It just seemed that Michael Moore was on a book tour, garbed a camcorder and asked random people about corporations. Still its not bad to watch once, its alright. But try to see it for free Roger and me was better. Not to mention better quality as it was filmed with 35 mm and Michael Moore spent everything to make it to try to save his town. Everyone should watch Roger and me, Bowling for columbine, and Fahrenheit 911 If you love those films and want more Moore then see this movie. If those weren't your thing then this won't be either since those are better. It dose deal layoffs. When company's make more money they fire workers to save more money, which just said 30min of the film for you. then theres 15 min of Moore telling Nike that the factory's that make the shoes are sweat shops and that those jobs should go to Americans and the chairman just says oh I don't know Moore doesn't show prof only a video of Americans who want to make shoes and thats it. And there is also the thing about company's telling workers not to speak to him. So basically only for die heart Moore fans and try to watch for really cheep. the big  one is not Moore's best one its is only an alright one.",1245024000,,2211,4.302158273381295
509486,4,6302746930,"There wasn't much point to this film, but Moore's antics and opinions are entertaining as usual. The subject of this documentary is basically the downsizing of multi-million dollar corporations and shipping work overseas.",1171324800,2,221,5.7272727272727275
509487,5,6302746930,G'D bless you Michael Moore for your crusades not only in the books you have written but also for your doccumentary movies to safeguard the working man blue collar workers. The Big One is depressing and funny at the same time. His political satire and savy humour helps you deal with the horrible reality of the coruption in government and in corporations in america. It is about time someone stood up to the corruption of the ceos and corporations. G'D gave michael moore the heart and the guts to go out there and fight the good fight not only for faith but also for justice.,1149206400,3,577,4.504761904761905

509489,1,6302746930,"This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous. Being that it is a Michael Moore movie I should have expected this but I tried to view it openly. Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars.",1140307200,6,329,4.15625
509490,1,6302746930,"Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films.",1132704000,7,395,4.171052631578948
509491,5,6302746930,"I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania that had a lot in common with the small cities of the midwest.  There was one employer that paid well and supported the town, and when they moved out the unemployment levels went to Great Depression levels.  My hometown took its hit in the 80's during the Regan Administration.  Steel was being ""offshored"" to Japan and put most of the steel mills out of business, and, in turn, lowered the demand for coal.  Now, Roger Moore exposes the biggest failure of the Clinton Administration, NAFTA.  H. Ross Perot predicted that if NAFTA were signed we would here a giant sucking sound of all the jobs going to Mexico... and we sure did!  After NAFTA was signed, many jobs (especially high paying union jobs) were exported to Mexico where laborers are exploited much more easily.  The result was catastrophic job loss for the manufacturing centers in the midwest.  The film has an ""in your face"" style as Roger Moore confronts those lining their pockets with riches as hardworking people are merely shoved aside.

I watched the film in a sociology class in college.  I suggest it for anyone entering the workforce!  You won't regret watching this!",1129248000,6,1182,4.745098039215686
509492,4,6302746930,"No one goes after the ""bad guys"" like Michael Moore. He is relentless asking big business why not take care of the working man who put you where you are today?  He asks the simple question, why not share the wealth?  He pursues the answers to these questions in a humorous and compassionate manner. Being a working woman myself, and working in the auto industry, I appreciate where this documentary comes from.",1127174400,3,410,4.680555555555555

509494,4,6302746930,Moore shows us that outsourcing was big when Clinton was president. He makes you ashamed of big corporations that value money over employees. Big One will open your eyes.,1122508800,3,170,4.896551724137931
509495,4,6302746930,"Ever since I saw ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" (which I thought was ferociously hilarious), I had been trying to check out Michael Moore's earlier work (both books and films). I finally got around to see ""The Big One"" this weekend. I felt like I could really relate to Michael's disdain for corporate America having had spent time working for a major corporation myself. I could relate to the employees of various corporations who have continually gotten screwed over by the corporate machine. I think it is hilarious how Random House tried to reign in Michael's shenanigans during his book tour with their escorts. While there are lots of hilarious moments when Michael tries to confront various company CEOs on why they are laying off their employees when they are making a good amount of cash, there is also a good mix of drama.

One of my favorite moments in the film was when Michael went to the capital in Wisconsin to talk to then Governor Tommy Thompson about his welfare reform policies with two women who were living below poverty level. Apparently the new welfare reform policy Tommy signed when he was governor doesn't work for everyone. I love the politician Michael and the women confront in the state capital was the equivalent of a snake oil salesman, no one was buying his schpiel because those women went through the process of the new welfare reform and they were still living below poverty.

One of the most personal and touching moments was when Michael was at a book signing at Borders' bookstore and one of the people in line was a woman who was recently laid off from Ford co.. I was moved by Michael's concern for the woman. I also liked his conversations with other people like the diners in Iowa (I think) and just getting their overall opinions on the presidential election in '92.

Like his other films, ""The Big One"" mixes biting satirical humor with real-life drama. Michael Moore's movies to me are like the MTV show ""Punk'd"" with a socio-political message and without that talent-challenged Ashton Kutcher.",1120089600,4,2027,4.802292263610315
509496,4,6302746930,"This is unreal.  Of all the CEO types with which Michael Moore spoke to, not one of them answered his question - If companies are making record profits (some in the billions) then why are there so many layoffs?

The man from NIKE said that he wouldn't open a shoe factory in the US because he doesn't think Americans would want to make shoes.

You've got to see this to believe.  Michael Moore is a genius.",1107820800,4,406,4.302631578947368
509497,2,6302746930,"I'm not quite sure what it is about a corporation that makes liberals lose all their rationality and common sense.  Michael Moore, in this movie, attacks the profit motive and seems to indicate that corporations ought to settle for lower profits, in exchange for raising their employee's sallaries.  Michael Moore fails to realize that unprofitable companies, or corporations with low profit margins, are even less able to pay their employee's the wages they seek.

I found this film problematic for a number of reasons.  First, one does not have to live in an area where there is one employer in the entire town.  If one chooses to live in such an area, and this area is economically depressed, they should do what any reasonable person would do: move.  Second, it is unreasonable to expect that the limited skills one has...will suffice for the entire duration of their life.  Sometimes one has to learn new skills if they want to maintain employable.  To think that the nation has to stand still simply because some people do not have the proper skills is unreasonable.  Ever hear of a city college?  Try one.  You can get new skills.  One does not need to lobby Congress or be a complainer.  Instead, I'd recommend 1) going to a location that is hiring and 2) getting some new skills.  You can't lose if you do both.",1107043200,3,1320,4.682608695652174
509498,5,6302746930,"This is definately my favorite Michael Moore movie.  In fact, this is probably one of my favorite movies altogether.

I especially like the ""awards"" he gives.  That just made me roll on the floor laughing, and always brings a smile to my face when I watch the movie, no matter how bad of a day I've had.",1097020800,9,303,4.280701754385965
509499,2,6302746930,"I am at heart soemwhat of a michael moore fan. I love bowling for columbine and roger and me was revolutionary for its time period. However the same thing can't be said about the big one. It basically in short summary is a cheap way for moore to promote his book tour for his first novel, Downsiize this. The film lacks depth and purpose and while it does make some good points about Welfare and welfare reform it basically says the same things that were stated in roger and me except in a less convincing way. The moore fan many like this. The casual movie watcher should stay away. It'll put you to sleep.",1096588800,5,607,4.333333333333333
509500,5,6302746930,"This film follows Michael Moore promoting his book, ""Downsize This!  Random Threats From An Unarmed American"".  But Moore doesn't just go to bookstores and that's it.  He manages to stop in a town where they make PayDay candy bars, only to find out that management is planning to close the factory down.  Moore is somehow able to talk with a manager who tells him that if PayDay sold more, the push to close the factory would've been quicker.  Moore's response, as ours should be, is ""That's insane!""

This moment only skims the surface of what ""The Big One"" is like.  Yet, the subjects it takes on are so touchy that it's no wonder the film was produced by The British Broadcasting Corporation (with Miramax kicking in, of course).  For much of the film, Moore tries to talk to executives who have downsized their workforce and give them awards for being ""corporate crooks"".  He nearly gets arrested at one point.

If Moore's message is more serious and dour in light of ""Bowling For Columbine"" and ""Farenheit 9/11"", you'd be surprised how pointed and humorous Moore is in this film.  While talking to some DJs, he suggests that America should change its name to The Big One (hence the title), that the national symbol should be a bald man instead of a bald eagle and our national anthem should be Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" because everybody knows it and we all sing it at the ballpark.

Some of the things revealed in this movie should be required viewing during this election year.  Such as the fact that some companies hire prisoners to work as telemarketers or to book airline flights.  One current Bush crony, Tommy Thompson, doesn't come off well here.  To show the former Governor that welfare mothers are not idle and want to work, Moore invites a group of welfare mothers over to clean up the Governor's office.

And there's a scattershot moment of former Congressman Bob Dornan complaining that illegal aliens voted for his opponent, Loretta Sanchez; Moore responds by filing countercharges that the people who voted for Dornan were insane.

The film ends with Moore having a sit-down with Philip Knight, the CEO of Nike and it is here that the film reveals its most potent, sobering moments.  Nike makes most of its shoes in Indonesia by teenage girls working in filthy conditions and being paid pittance under the guise of a military dictatorship.  Though millions of Americans buy Nike shoes, they don't make Nike shoes in America.  So, Moore gives Knight some airline tickets to Indonesia telling him, ""You've got to see what it's like!  You've got to go!""  Knight's reasoning for making shoes in Indonesia is that Americans don't want to make shoes.  Yet, Moore shows Knight a video of people in his hometown of Flint, Michigan saying that they'd be willing to make shoes for Nike.

If you enjoyed ""Bowling For Columbine"" or ""Farenheit 9/11"", you'll definitely enjoy this rarely seen documentary.  It's funny as well as eye-opening, in typical Moore fashion.  Moore is supposedly working on another doc about the medical insurance companies.  Doesn't sound like an interesting subject for a film?  Well, in ""The Big One"", Moore and several protestors gather outside the headquarters of Kaiser-Permanente.  The titles below the screen read, ""This is a HMO---HMO stands for Hand the Money Over"".  In the words of our current Commander In Chief, bring it on!",1096416000,11,3372,4.844405594405594
509501,4,6302746930,"Like Moore's earlier film ""Roger and Me"", ""The Big One"" (Moore's tongue-in-cheek term for the large, all-encompassing corporate bohemoth that this country may eventually become) takes a disturbing yet often comical look at how Big Business is running roughshod over whatever is left of Corporate Responsibility in this country.
This film is alternatingly funny and deeply depressing.  Mainly, however, you want to shake Moore's hand for having the chutzpah to shove a microphone and camera in Corporate America's faces and demand they explain their ""outsourcing"" actions directly to the faithful and long-term employees (generations of them, in some cases) who were unceremoniously dumped in favor of cheaper overseas or over-the-border labor.
These large corporations are selling America off piece by piece, in a way.  They are giddily happy to lay off American workers by the thousands to make a few extra bucks, line their pockets a bit more, or hasten their Golden Parachute paydays.
Sure, a primary function of a business is to make money.  But when doing so to such excess involves actions that could undermine America's already fragile socio-economic fabric on a relatively grand scale, then it becomes an issue of Conscience.  Moore, like many of us, realizes this.  Moore rushes up to the Corporate Big Dogs (or at least the highest-ranking ones he can find or the nearest media outlet he can find) and asks the questions we wish we could ask  -- he expresses the common-man outrage we wish we could express.  We all have motive, but Moore has motive AND opportunity.
Few of his theatrics will actually result in actual change, but perhaps they serve a higher purpose:  to get us to wake up and realize that all is not well in America, that Big Business is making DAMN sure that the economic chasms between the haves and the have-nots will continue to expand, and that YOUR JOB IS NEVER, EVER GOING TO BE SAFE.  The days of working for the same company from college 'til the day you retire are all but over.  Your job can be taken away from you AT ANY TIME as soon as the powers-that-be at XYZ Corporation figure out that it can be economically profitable to throw your entire town out of work.
And the attendant problems that go with massive layoffs:  increases in crime, suicides, etc....  Well, sorry!  You should have gone to Harvard Business School, got an MBA or something, and snagged one of those rare, hard-to-get jobs where you just show up, meet with your Accounting, Finance, and Legal Departments, and start divvying up the pie you are about to share.
Enron, Worldcom, Pillsbury, Nike...... they aren't unique in their business practices.  They are just the higher-profile ones we have all heard about.  This kind of ""morally and socially questionable"" business practice happens everywhere.
Your company may be next.  How much do you have in savings right now?  You'd better check.  And be afraid.  Be very afraid.",1090022400,40,2936,4.942973523421589
509502,3,6302746930,"Like in most cases in Michael Moore's work a book precedes a movie. In this case the publishing and success of 'Downsize This' let to this movie. It's mostly about his book tour after the book through about 35 cities in the United States. Focused mostly on the Midwest it follows him and his media appearances. Funniest moments are when he pays some visits to big companies (Pillsbury eg) that just downsized. Surprisingly enough the big boss of Nike (who make all their shoes in Indonesia) is willing to speak to Moore, leading to an awkward but honest converstation.
It's not Moore's best work, Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine are better and funnier and more revolting too. But if you like his books and movies, this is worth it.",1089504000,7,738,4.641221374045801

Those that detract from the works of Moore are usually those of neo-Nixon flag waving brain dead variety. He doesn't attack capitalism, but rather the lack of duty CEO's have to the people of America, like how Nike won't produce shoes in the US (Nike.. the all American shoe..)
The documentary follows Michael across the US whilst on a book signing tour. During this tour, (unbeknown to the book publishers) looks out people being downsized in the cities he visits - and then goes on to try to help.
I can only imagine this movie was to get a point across, or at lease to make one think about one's surroundings. Either way he does both. Other detractors of this film claim he takes a childish, slapstick approach to dealing with his problems with ""fat cat America"" he doesn't. Infact the humor is not crude at all. He must be doing some thing right if he was invited to talk at Harvard.

There is a lot of evil here in our own country, and more power  to Michael Moore for trying to do something about it. And if the movie  lacks the focus of his 1989 masterpiece ""Roger & Me"", you  can't blame the guy for trying. At least he seems to care.",960163200,4,484,4.528735632183908
509533,5,6302746930,"All political and personal ideologies aside, this movie is hugely entertaining. Whether or not you agree with Moore doesn't really have an impact on whether or not the movie will keep you laughing. But aside from  the entertainment value, this movie makes you think about whether you agree  with him or not. It raises the question of what should be fundamentally  more important to an American corporation: saving Americans' jobs or  increasing profit? In this movie Moore presents this as a black and white  issue--that if you have a heart and any love for humanity at all, you would  never close down American factories and move operations overseas. And he is  quite persuasive.",959644800,2,680,4.964601769911504
509534,5,6302746930,"Michael Moore should be in the presidential cabinet. I don't care as what. Invent a position for him. First of all, he's funnier than...well, than a lot of people. Moore has a way of finding fault with some accepted part of  the status quo and pointing it out in a way that one wonders why they  didn't realize that it was ridiculous a long time ago. ""The Big  One"" is hilarious, but it's a pointedly persuasive movie, too. An  example: Moore recently (this is as of May 2000) became the campaign  strategist for several Ficus plants running for office against incumbent  and unopposed candidates. Moore says that the plants will do a far better  job than the candidates who have been entering congress by default, and it  doesn't need all the money that the candidates get, anyway. It does need,  though, a little fertilizer, which according to Moore, it ""should find  plenty of in Washington."" And of particular note is the segment on the  video of Steve Forbes...just watch for it. Buy this movie!",958694400,35,1000,4.689655172413793
509535,3,6302746930,"Let me start by saying that this film has many brilliant, provocative moments.  I greatly admire Moore's spunk and persistence in skewering his deserving targets -- America's major corporations and their supporters.  However, this is somewhat disappointing on the heels of Moore's first  effort ""Roger and Me.""  The main reason, I think, is because  ""Roger"" had much more focus, and served as an interesting case  study of how one corporation callously ignores human needs.
 Michael  Moore obviously tries to keep on the same track with this film, but it is  obvious that he(probably unknowingly) unerestimated the way in which too  much comic appeal can trivialize important issues. There are too many  scenes with Moore doing his ""stand-up"" comic routine; not enough  ones to highlight the hypocrisy of the corporate brass. It is interesting  that Phil Knight, CEO at Nike, agrees to talk with Moore on camrera.  I  think it's because he is clever enough to realize that Moore had, at this  time, already leaned so far in the direction of comedy, that nothing said  would seriously register with the movie audience. (In fact, Knight comes  across as a likable though misguided ""straight man"" for Moore).  That's the disappointing element here.  For most viewers, this will be a  good laugh, and then it's back to exploitation of American workers as  usual. Still, one hopes that there are enough out there who will, after  laughing, say to themselves, ""This is funny, but what's happening in  America isn't.  Something has to be done.""",954288000,20,1537,5.052

I know that doesn't sound like that much, but it is pure hilarity and he's more dangerous than ever.  Inviteing Nike's  CEO to visit a nike plant in indoniesia made me wet myself.",928540800,,280,4.431372549019608
509538,5,6302746930,"If you think there aren't two sides to every coin, then Michael Moore's documentary of his ""Downsize This"" book tour will change your mind. This video should be required viewing for corporate America's next  generation--the MBA students sitting in classrooms throughout our country.  Before closing an entire PayDay candybar plant in order to collect a huge  annual bonus, every MBA should already know what he/she will say when  Michael Moore's or someone else's camera walks in his/her office to ask,  ""Why?""",920073600,,510,5.246913580246914
509539,5,6302746930,"Michael Moore carries on his crusade to reveal the lies and corruption within corporate America with this intelligent, funny film. Following firmly in the footsteps of Roger and Me, this film is a documentary of  Moore's book tour following the release of ""Downsize This"". Many  of the bits appear in the book, but some of the precious gems captured here  do not. Moore's casual, but in your face humor is well evidenced in this  film as is his moral outrage in the face of the corporate ravages on the  American people and families. I loved this film in the theaters and will  buy a copy myself as soon as the price drops. In the meantime, rent it!

They stand for what's right for our society, and where it went wrong.  It's very sad knowing that other countries are benefitting from our ideals and we are not.  Over the years, M. Moore movies have been so enlightening about society in our country .  I think this is another excellent movie that is thought provoking and on the money about the USA and the way we function.
