8344500,3,B001UI3ORC,"Filmmakers Sumitra Bhave and Sunil Sukhtankar have consistently given Marathi audiences' socially relevant, heartwarming films all the way from 'DOGHI' to 'VAASTUPURUSH'.Their latest film 'DEVRAI' (Sacred Grove) is undoubtedly amongst their best work and surely the most impressive Marathi film made in the last two years - never mind that people thought a much lesser 'SHWAAS' deserved a National Award.
The absolutely true-to-life characters - from Seena and Kalyani to Sudesh and even minor players like Shesh's mother, bring immense credibility to the story. Above all it is stunning performances from Sonali Kulkarni and more importantly, Atul Kulkarni, which make this film special. Notice Seena's breakdown when Shesh's imaginary world actually starts creating doubts in her mind too. As for Atul, the sheer consistency with which he portrays a complex character like Shesh - his body language, his mannerisms, his voice modulation and the entire personality of a mentally disturbed man - is outstanding.
Most films, which deal with specific issues, tend to get too preachy and therefore uninteresting. 'DEVRAI'  is exceptional because it gets the message across and touches a chord deep inside - one hopes this will be the true harbinger of good Marathi cinema in years to come.",1300752000,,1286,5.398009950248756
