4962612,5,B0066PSYYM,"Protector of women, killer of the bad guys, and smokin' hot while doing it!  In interviews, Salman Khan has said that films need heroes - the people you cheer for unabashedly in a world where the bad guys always deserve a sound thrashing.  This is one of those films, and it's one of my favorites with Salman Khan. It's a slick, sophisticated blend of action, comedy, and romance, and Salman fits it perfectly. He plays an adorable thug (with a secret twist to his character), paired off with the equally adorable Ayesha Takia. The action sequences are stunning, but it's the romantic moments, which range from sweet to laugh-out-loud hilarious, that ultimately make me love the film.  Scenes in elevators, trains, and subway platforms highlight the amusing awkwardness of new romance.  One might think that Salman Khan is a bit too mature to be playing a ""boyfriend"" role more appropriate for a 20-year-old, but he pulls it off beautifully through sheer force of charm.  The scene in which he and Ayesha argue over a tupperware container of pasta still makes me laugh.

The music of Sajid-Wajid is fantastic, and this is one of the first Hindi action movies that had me noticing the catchiness of the background score in addition to the dance numbers.  The first dance sequence (""Mera Jalwa"") is jaw-dropping - the choreography is amazing, and Salman has never danced better. Seriously.  The dance also features three cameos that will surprise you (if you're familiar with Indian actors).  ""Dil Leke Darde Dil"" is sweetly sexy and rhythmic.

In summary, the action is stunning, the villains are truly villainous, and the romance is sweet. It almost feels like a trial run for the character that Salman would perfect in the following year's ""Dabangg"".",1302048000,4,1751,4.925170068027211
4962613,4,B0066PSYYM,"To tell the truth, I've never cared all that much for Salman Khan, what with the muscles and all the posing and the tabloid stuff. But I'll say this, he's very good in WANTED and convincingly inhabits the part of the unstoppable Radhe. He makes you forget all the baggage. Salman Khan is in his 40s now but give him credit for still being able to pull off the really trying, physical aspects his role calls for. There's a lot of stunts in this one, and the guy does a fair number of them. Not to mention all the exhausting musical numbers.

The plot: As gang wars erupt in Mumbai, one man begins to make his mark. Radhe is a ruthless gangster, a vicious enforcer willing to work for whoever will pay him. He comes across almost as this elemental force, absolutely fearless and willing to tweak the noses of even the most lofty of underworld dons. But Radhe isn't all badass killer. He occasionally does exhibit a softer side, especially whenever the curvy and wholesome Jhanvi (Ayesha Takia) is around, and then he melts in her presence. When Jhanvi is harassed by a shady police inspector, Radhe is inspired to even more extravagant lengths of meanness and brutality.

It's not much of a plot and yet WANTED, with its polished look and breakneck pace, doesn't exactly lack for confidence. It's an unapologetic, freewheeling masala Hindi film. It flirts with a sweet romance, well-choreographed musical numbers, that intense gangster vibe, ridiculously over-the-top action, and some unexpected laughs (but also some lame stabs at humor, thanks to that chubby landlord guy). WANTED goes against convention in that the romance isn't more heavily featured, although we do get exposed to overwrought bits when Ayesha Takia's character struggles to come to terms with her having fallen in love with a murderous thug. Surprisingly, Ayesha and Salman's scenes together provide a good dose of levity.

It's been a while since Salman Khan got a chance to kick asss and take names, and he seems to relish getting back into the mix. The action sequences tend to be more outrageous and stylish than realistic, and there's a lot of wire-fu going on here. But it's fun watching Salman Khan bring the attitude and take goons out with impunity. Note that both the two main bad guys exude an impressive aura of menace, so it's even more gratifying when they get what's coming to them. Salman Khan, he comes on as so indomitable that I might even put money on him if he ever got in a cage match with Krrish. And, for the female audience, what's a Salman Khan flick without his ripping his shirt off? Salman isn't about to pass up a chance to flex his guns.

The film left me with the impression that it had more than the usual number of musical numbers. I was a little surprised to later find out that WANTED only featured six tracks, just about the normal amount in Indian cinema. Maybe it felt like there were more because the songs weren't spaced out evenly enough. Doesn't really matter. Thankfully, most of the musical numbers are dang watchable and catchy, especially the chilled out romantic song ""Dil Leke"" and the riveting ""Jalwa"" which features cameos by Anil Kapoor, Govinda, and the film's director Prabhu Deva. The few times I've seen Salman Khan onscreen, I wasn't too impressed with his dancing skills. This is the best I've ever seen him, and to see him bust out the dynamic moves in ""Jalwa"" (my favorite song here) was a bit of a revelation.

Disc 1 has the feature film and scene and song selections. Disc 2 has these bonus features: 5 minutes of deleted scenes (no sub-titles), including an extended train sequence (which begins with Radhe and Jhanvi exchanging numbers) and also new annoying bits with that fat landlord guy; the music videos ""Mitti Ke Sine"" and ""Ishq Vishq"" (which I don't remember being in the movie); the Making Of the music video ""Mitti Ke Sine""; remixes of ""Love Me, Love Me,"" ""Ishq Vishq,"" and Jalwa""; and a 20-minute Behind the Scenes look at WANTED, enough of it in English that non-Hindi speaking cats like me can follow along.",1264896000,4,4054,4.712270803949224
4962614,5,B0066PSYYM,"A story about a man who kills anyone for money. A man who has no emotions in him.

  Story starts with Radhe(Salman khan) who is shown as mafia killer who kills for money. As the story unfolds he becomes more aggressive. He has no feelings for anyone execpt one day his eye falls on a beautiful lady. He saves her twice and the romantic story rushes in. He has some secrets which he cant tell to her. He keeps on killing people. This thing provokes Ghanibhai(Prakash Raj) who does a marvelous job as main villian. He comes to India to find out who has killed his man that runs Mumbai(Bombay) for him. Then comes in a corrupt inspector(cop) Mahesh Manjrekar who does a humorous role throughout the movie. Vinod Khanna who does a role of a Gym owner has a typical role which I can't open here because of plot's secret story. Salman Khan is exceptional throughout the whole movie. After 2007's Partner. Salman gives Huge Blockbuster.",1264809600,2,930,4.5568862275449105
4962615,5,B0066PSYYM,"""Wanted"" emerged as one of the top Blockblusters of Bollywood in 2009. It is filled with wall to wall action, song and dance, comedy and romance.  Bollywood superstar Salman Khan(son of superstar sceenwriter Salim Khan), after years of mediocre movies, returns with a hit this time.  He is badas* in this flick as a goon available for hire.  The mafia wants him to do their dirty jobs, he falls for a sweet girl, and he has to deal with corrupt cops as well as gansters.  The movie, like most Indian movies, is over 2 and a half hours long.  But I was never bored.  Towards the last hour, things starts to get exciting. I won't spoil the surprises.  But I totally enjoyed this movie, even going back to watch parts of it.

This movie is the Hindi remake of the Tamil movie of the excellent blockbuster Telugu movie ""Pokiri""-written and directed by the talented Puri Jagannadh.  Prabhu Deva is a famed dancer/choreographer turned director who directed the Tamil remake(""Pokkiri"") as well as the Hindi(Bollywood) version.  He makes an appearance as a dancer in the song ""Jalwa"", he's the last guy who appears and dances real good next to Salman.

I dug up the original ""Pokiri"" and it is nearly identical to the remakes, scene by scene, line by line.  They are smart not to mess up a good thing.  ""Wanted""(also known as ""Wanted Dead And Alive"")  is a little more glossy but the other two are quite polished as well.  The major difference is.. Salman gives a superb performance, and takes off his shirt at the end.

Fun and exciting, I highly recommend this DVD.",1259798400,15,1559,4.614545454545454

4962617,5,B0066PSYYM,Salman Khan stolevmy heart in this one. His rugged good looks. Bad boy persona. The twisting this movie was unexpected. A wonderful action movie. That also made me get up and dance. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.,1373155200,,227,4.3023255813953485
4962618,5,B0066PSYYM,"I want to start off by saying that Salman Khan is definitely one of my favorite actors of Indian cinema :)
Wanted illustrates violence and murder amongst gang rivals in addition to police corruption. Salman (Radhe) is portrayed as the ""bad boy"" who basically kills for a living-he's a contract killer. Though there is much violence, there is a shining light of romance. Salman is smitten with a young girl who doesn't understand his lifestyle and way of life, nevertheless she really likes him. The romantic portion of the film in my opinion creates a softer side to Salman's gangster role. While watching Wanted I was making note of the psychological attributes surrounding a gangster/contract killer and love/romance-It makes you wonder if it is possible for a man who has a violent lifestyle to be able to fall in love or show love. Are gangsters capable of maintaining relationships with women? In addition there is a twist to the plot,
(*HINT-Salman (Radhe) isn't really who he says he is) Great movie!! Oh and Salman Khan's body is beautiful!! there is a scene
towards the end where he takes his shirt off-phenomenal!!.",1372809600,,1125,4.895287958115183
4962619,5,B0066PSYYM,"I have a membership with Netflix but they didn't have this movie and it was ""unknown"" when it would become available through them.  I really, really wanted to watch this movie because it marked the beginning streak of some number one hit movies starring Salman Khan in India and so I bought it! I was concerned that maybe I wouldn't like the story but I did. It was actually stunning to me in several places; it could rival a hard hitting Hollywood movie but without the foul language. It also had humor, romance, mystery, intrigue, and awesome song and dance numbers. I definitely recommend buying yourself a copy and watching over and over again.

His acting was superb and while I wasn't sure the actress that played the heroine was the perfect choice with Salman but somehow it seemed to work after watching it halfway through. Simply love all the song and dance routines in this movie,especially "" Jalwa"" and ""Love Me, Love Me"" - Salman might not dance like Hrithik Roshan but he did a superb job with
that body! WANTED has a good story line, basically about a hired assassin(Salman) working amongst the mafias and the corrupt police but with an agenda of his own.
