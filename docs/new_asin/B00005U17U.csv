7954065,4,B00005U17U,My daughter can't get enough of this video.  It's her absolute favorite.  It's entertaining and educational.....and the pacing is just right for a 15 month old.,1132531200,,160,5.115384615384615
7954066,2,B00005U17U,"This was formerlly called ""Baby Monet"" (same thing, just different name now). This has songs about colors of the rainbow (they compare each color to a fruit color), shapes, farm animals, etc. I thought the farm animal part was strange when they said a cow says, ""Maaaa"". They sing a song that says, ""Chickadee, chickadee, happy and gay"", which is kind of strange (I heard this song from Barney and they sang, ""...happy all day"" not happy and gay). They show how pottery is made. There is a nature song about stars the moon and the sun. They show puppets painting birdhouses, face painting, making sand art, making shapes out of glow sticks. The mans singing voice isn't the best. One song a woman sings and I had a hard time understanding the words. The first time we watched this my daughter was 16 months old and she sat and watched the entire video. This was the first video she ever sat through. A few weeks later I put it in and she didn't seem to care. By then she was starting to like other videos. This one is better then Your Tiny Maestro but still it wasn't good enough for me to want to keep and let my child watch again and again (not even good enough for watching once in awhile, in my opinion).",1116374400,,1208,4.349557522123894
