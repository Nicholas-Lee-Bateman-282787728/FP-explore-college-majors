2895083,1,B000T9D6VW,it was not the kind of stretching I was looking for.  DVD was very miss leading.  Wish I could return it.  Wish you could view a little of it before you buy,1333065600,2,156,3.8125
2895084,3,B000T9D6VW,"I borrowed this from the library to see if it's something I'd like to purchase. Ms. Smith's body is lovely and her movements impressive for anyone, especially so for anyone over the age of _____(fill in the blank with the age you were when you noticed yourself becoming stiff!). However, the movements are much too fast for anyone but a trained and in-shape dancer/athlete to follow with ease. Many people probably won't understand how to do the contractions Ms. Smith mentions and there is little to no explanation of ""how"" to do things. Nothing is actually broken down into separate movements, that I could see. (I do admit to jumping here and there, however, and not watching the entire disc once I knew it wasn't for me.) The tempo at which Ms Smith runs through each segment leaves little time to figure it out. I'd be hard put to follow this on a small screen, twisting my head to see what she's doing, and I have a dance background. Bottom line, I'd say this is pleasant to watch but I'll keep looking for an exercise/stretching DVD that's a little gentler and slower-paced for my personal rise and shine routine. Oh--if I could I'd give it 2.5 stars--I do like it but simply because I enjoy seeing an older woman moving with such ease. As an exercise video I'd say it's for experienced exercisers in good condition only.",1331856000,6,1328,4.6075949367088604
2895085,3,B000T9D6VW,"What happened to Thursday?  Not a big deal in the overall scheme of things, but come on!  I have 2 of her other videos and I like this one the best, which isn't saying much!  If you want stretching for seniors, or for out-of-shape people, or for those of us with bad knees, etc., go with Ann Pringle's series.",1266710400,10,309,4.203389830508475
2895086,4,B000T9D6VW,Now all I need is to find the time to do this.  It is great for someone who does not exercise much and needs the stretching.  I recommend it.,1244592000,2,141,3.8275862068965516
2895087,3,B000T9D6VW,"Good tape but my wife and I prefer Ann Smith's earlier tape ""Stretching for Seniors"".",1234742400,10,85,4.733333333333333

8208158,4,B000T9D6VW,Like it because I can do a whole week's worth in a short time.  Maybe a little top simple for me.,1416096000,2,97,3.619047619047619
8208159,2,B000T9D6VW,"Ann Smith's  inhale, exhale, stretch & move is excellent, Rise and Shine was an nnecessary purchase, Three minutes daily is for the birds.",1411689600,3,138,5.0
8208160,5,B000T9D6VW,Perfect type of exercise for seniors not too hard but not too easy.,1410220800,2,67,4.230769230769231
8208161,1,B000T9D6VW,This tape is horrible.  Way to fast and hard to keep up with....There must have been a sale somewhere that she needed to get to and so don't waste your money!  I wouldnt even take it if it was free....,1397001600,,201,4.0
8208162,5,B000T9D6VW,"Love doing the stretching exercises to music!!  Gentle, toning and strengthening moves, great for seniors, or those who are limited because of recovering from surgery.  Complete and understandable explanations.",1378252800,3,210,6.206896551724138
8208163,4,B000T9D6VW,This is a great dvd for the aging although sometimes Ann moves a bit to fast for those not as practiced at exercise. But it is good because you can do a lot or a little each day.,1357344000,2,178,3.710526315789474
8208164,2,B000T9D6VW,Filmed in this couple's bedroom.  It is mis-titled as it puts you to sleep with the slow pacing and the monotony of the 'trainer's' voice.  She was a dancer and is very flexible.  Didn't quite give me the wake up stretching I was looking for.,1338595200,2,242,4.333333333333333
