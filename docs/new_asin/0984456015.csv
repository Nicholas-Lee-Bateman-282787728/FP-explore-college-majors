8146487,5,0984456015,"Meadows and meadow-style plantings are becoming increasingly popular as homeowners, landscape designers, and even commercial site managers discover the inherent beauty and user-friendliness of this all-American garden style.

Unlike traditional mown turf lawns, meadows require minimal maintenance and almost no irrigation (once established); they provide excellent cover and forage for all manner of birds, bees, butterflies and other beneficial insects; and best of all, they're beautiful, providing an ever-changing display throughout the seasons.

Catherine Zimmerman's DVD and companion book--Urban and Suburban Meadows--are excellent resources for anyone interested in installing a meadow, large or small.  The visuals alone are enough to sell the concept, but combined with the well-researched ecological arguments, the participation by leading experts in the field (Doug Talamy, Larry Weaner, Neil Diboll), and Zimmerman's straight-forward, accessible presentation, I can't imagine anyone NOT scanning his or her yard/garden/community for the best spot to plant a new meadow.

This DVD should be mandatory viewing for every homeowner's association across the country.",1337904000,2,1175,6.279503105590062

In this companion video to her very useful book on meadow-building for homeowners, Zimmerman gives us experts like Doug Tallamy and Neil Diboll to see and hear. There are great visual treats of real-life transformations from sterile lawn to lush meadows, large and small, where birds thrive.

What I love about both the DVD and the book is that Zimmerman gives us alternatives - want to go small, there are a couple of choices you can consider. If you want to cover larger spaces, you can learn about ways to do that. Throughout the reasons to do this abound - the songs of birds, beautiful and interesting flowers, the opportunity for kids to discover a caterpillar, or to watch a butterfly wind it's way around the yard.

Zimmerman highlights the strength of plants that can build substantial and good-looking meadow areas, regardless of soil conditions. It's easier than you think and better than you can imagine. Building habitat and sharing your space will enhance your life. Zimmerman's work makes that easy.",1337644800,,1146,4.896907216494846
