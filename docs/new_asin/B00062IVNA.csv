2163061,5,B00062IVNA,"Don't let the other critics fool you, Species III is a pretty

entertaining entry into the species series, true it was

to direct to video, but with MGM backing up this installment

with Brad Turner taking the helm, you knew it be pretty good.

Natasha Henstridge briefly reprises her role as ""Eve"" to the

Species series and gives birth to another alien Sara,

who is the latest genetic alien.

This time around though we got an excellent sidestory about

the halfbreeds, half human, half alien freaks who dont

bother in either class and die out from disease.

Well a couple of more dangerous new half breeders come

out to seek Sara in hopes of using her eggs to breed

a new race.

The acting is pretty good, the movie has some impressive

effects and the movie like the other two sequels is

very scary and gory.

The Special Edition DVD comes with four great featurettes,

which includes interviews with the cast and crew including

the beautiful Natasha Henstridge, commentary and a look

back into why the Species series has been so successful.",1103241600,4,1052,4.681318681318682
2163062,1,B00062IVNA,"The third, and hopefully final, entry into the Species series finds a low budget approach taken to the film.  Series star Natasha Henstridge makes an all too short cameo in the beginning of the film, as she births a super hot alien/human hybrid with mating on her mind.  Besides that, the rest of Species 3 comes off like a made for TV movie, with some bad FX but some nice T&A to go around.  The acting is horrible, the story barely makes any sense, and there is hardly any redeeming factor to be found in the film.  Fans of the surprise 1995 guilty pleasure hit and even it's lacking sequel may want to check this out since it does continue the tradition of what is in a Species movie: no plot, but a horde of gore and nudity.",1103241600,9,728,4.253623188405797
2163063,2,B00062IVNA,"I fell asleep....

If you want to see a little T&A, then this might be for you (then again why not rent a porno?)

If you want to see a horror movie, then this falls right into the roger corman generic, no story line, bad FX horror movies...

I gave it one star for the lead girls roll, and the fact that there is 100's of worse horror movies than this. The problem is, there is 1000's better than this",1103155200,2,402,4.0
2163064,5,B00062IVNA,"All bad reviews of ""Species 3"" are right.

1 minus star rating because this movie is the weakest of all 3, it stinks if you will and has no socially redeeming features. Well, so what. It's entertaining, interesting and has lots of nudity. We need to see naked women because the moral police wants all of us to be clean and innocent choir boys. In the back of my mind I have a notion that a lot of Muslim boys have never seen women in their lives. No wonder they volunteer for suicide bombings.

I will give 1 minus star to MGM for being stingy with the budget. All reviews I have read until now, don't bother mentioning this fact. You get the truth by listening to the comments of director Brad Turner.

As an example, there is one scene where you see a gasoline hose spilling fuel on the ground and expect an explosion. Nothing. The director says, however, they wanted an explosion but could not do it due to budget constraints.

C'mon, MGM, don't kill a good thing. Improve it. You can do it! Give this guys more money!

5-stars for the work done by Sunny Mabrey as Sara, the alien. Her character has not only remarkable but extremely difficult scenes. She succeeds with flying colors. Besides that, she has a perfect figure and I am deeply in love with her. If all aliens are like Sunny, we should open our doors to them without hesitation.

A second alien, a real mean one, portrayed by Amelia Cooke, is outstanding. This lady not only has a perfect figure but her acting is superb. I am deeply in love with her too. My door is wide open.

Anoter 1 minus star because there is no frontal nudity. With so much uninhibited beauty around, to be prudish is a felony.

If the way of the future is HD-direct-to-video filming of this kind, I am all for it. For once, we will have no stupid censorship and, as grown-ups are supposed to be able to do, we shall choose what we want to watch without well-intentioned zealots telling us what is good for us.

This movie stands below S1 and S2, but it was done with honesty. The crew not only had to struggle with a limited budget but also they filmed it in 28 days. I am sure the director could have introduced still more nudity (not a bad idea) but decided not to do so. That's honesty and confirms my 5-star rating.",1103068800,8,2259,4.334123222748815
2163065,1,B00062IVNA,"I was hoping that this 3rd movie would be better than number 2, but it's long and boring......my advise is just stick with the first one as that one was a really good movie.

Too bad 2 & 3 sucked, oh well live and learn!",1102982400,4,220,3.888888888888889
2163066,2,B00062IVNA,"OK, here we go again!  Not bad for direct to video, but not nearly as good as the first.  I get the sense a TV show may be coming, lets hope not. Unrated features lots more nudity and gore than seen on Sci-Fi channel.  Acting is cheesy, creatures are cheesy, set design is cheesy, but so was the 2nd installment.  If you have the first 2, then you do need part 3 to complete your set.  Just sit back, grab some pizza for all that cheese, and enjoy.",1102204800,,448,4.045454545454546
2163067,1,B00062IVNA,"Species 3 picks up right where the second ends.  It starts off with Eve giving birth to the perfect Alien before being killed by a halfing.  A College Professor takes the Alien child and escapes from the Government.  He then raises the small Alien in hopes that he can perfect it and there for become famouse in the name of science.  However the halflings want her because she holds the key to their survival.  Eventually the government finds them but only sends in one agent to take care of the problem.  In the end the perfect alien escapes into the tranquil country where she can live in peace.

This movie has a lot of problems the worst being the made for TV feel.  There were many times that I swore this was a made for Sci Fi Movie.  The second is that this title is no longer the Sci Fi Horror Erotica that the first two were.  Sure the Alien gets naked (Sorry no full frontal) as well as one of the hybrids.  But beyond that there is nothing else to brag about.  The plot did make an increase but in truth who watched the first two for the plot.  Come on the story is that an alien who looks like a hot chick screws guys and kills them.  This I pray is the death nail to the series.  Not Recomended.",1101772800,6,1208,4.1688311688311686
2163068,4,B00062IVNA,"This movie is far from great, and feels, and looks exactly like a TV movie.  The movie was made for Sci-Fi and looks it, but is still somewhat more interesting then the other dreck I've seen coming out of that channel.  If you are going to watch Species 3, get the R rated or Unrated cuts.  Don't bother with the TV version.  The parts of this movie that are interesting are the extreme violence, and the almost non-stop nudity and sex.  I'm not joking.  The second Sara, the new alien, matures she is naked for a good twenty minutes.  The story itself is entertaining, and the cast is good, although it does seem that everyone really would rather be doing something else, with the exception of Robin Dunne as the lead male, the guy who played his roommate, and Sunny Mabre and the girl who played Amelia. So basically, the younger twenty-something cast did well, while the older actors seemed to phone it in.

The effects are decent, with some great gore moments, and the creatures, while cheesy as can be, fit in with the film very well.  The action is a little hokey, but over all, it works.

I saw the R-rated cut, and while all the violence was intact, there is about one minute more of nudity in the unrated cut.  How there could be more, I have no idea, because the Sara and Amelia's breasts are on display for a good portion of the films running time.  If you want a cheesy, but entertaining B-grade Sci Fi flick, there are worse things you can get, although I would suggest getting the first movie instead.  But if you've already seen Species 1 and 2, check out part 3.  I do think they would have been better off doing a TV series than this movie, but either way, I have a feeling that if this does alright we will probably end up with a Species 4.",1097971200,58,1758,4.336391437308868

2163160,4,B00062IVNA,"Eve's reign of terror inexplicably comes to a screeching halt, taken out by a tongue!  She's been riddled with bullets, gassed, beaten up, and slaughtered, yet it's an ignominious demise at the `hands' of a sickly half alien boy that ultimately finishes her off for good and all.  Why ever did Natasha Henstridge return for this?  They could just as easily have done the scene with sock puppets and achieved the same effect.

Once again, they've redefined who or what the alien scourge is.  This time the plot involves a dubious professor (Robert Knepper as Dr. Abbot), who has a soft spot for virulent diseases and sees an attractive possibility in helping the aliens to thrive.  He more or less blackmails a dopey student (Robin Dunne) into helping him with this enterprise, starting with the disposal of a body (they get quite good at body disposal).  They end up dealing with the bland blonde daughter of Eve (played with stupefying numbness by Sunny Mabrey).  She's also driven to procreate and has no problem waltzing around completely naked (what is it with aliens and clothes!?).  The wardrobe budget on these films must have been a buck fifty for what they saved on fabric.

Nothing new is added to the basic plot line.  Although it would have helped had they explained where all these half alien `people' were coming from and how they came into being when the batch that hatched in Species II was supposed to have been dealt with in that movie.  Suddenly we're the gateway to the Universe.  The top vacation spot.

As Schlocky sci-fi flicks go, I've seen worse.  It is lame at times, poorly acted by some, doesn't rely much on common sense, but it is entertaining after a rudimentary fashion.

2163199,1,B00062IVNA,"""Species"" was decent. ""Species II"" was subpar, but did have some interesting moments.

But what about ""Species III,"" a much cheaper direct-to-DVD with almost none of the previous cast? Well, it's pretty much a dog -- it's on par with one of the higher-quality SyFy TV movies, with a lot of naked girls and panicked geneticists running around. And the required blonde alien-hybrid has absolutely no redeeming characteristics -- she's just cold and nasty.

The story picks up roughly where ""Species II"" left off: A medical van carrying Eve's (Natasha Henstridge) body is suddenly attacked by a half-breed alien boy. Eve suddenly comes back to life, and immediately gives birth to a baby girl -- only to be killed by the half-breed. Before the kid can attack the baby, Dr. Abbot (Robert Knepper) runs off into the woods with her.

Yes, Natasha Henstridge is only in the movie for about three minutes, and she doesn't even have a line. Apparently this was just to fulfill her three-movie contract.

Dr. Abbot secretly raises the girl, whom he names Sara -- and after only a few days, she matures into a beautiful woman (Sunny Mabrey) who promptly starts looking for a mate. But she rejects all the humans because they have genetic flaws -- and it turns out that her half-breed half-siblings are all dying from compromised immune systems.

So Abbot enlists a grad student, Dean (Robin Dunne), to help him create a pure, disease-free strain of the ""species""... not realizing that the half-breeds are closing in on Sara, who may be their only hope. Oh, and the government is also searching for Sara, but they're apparently too stupid to actually CHECK on the home of a missing man who vanished at the same time as an alien baby.

If it weren't for the first ten minutes, you would think that ""Species III"" had no actual connection to the first two movies -- the tone, the depiction of the ""pure"" alien, the sci-fi technology, the term ""half-breeds,"" and how almost none of the halfbreeds seem to be the kids from ""Species II"" (presumably to avoid adding incest). Even the classic HR Giger design has been ditched for what looks like a lizard suit.

Actually, it feels like the pilot to a TV show loosely based on the Species franchise, because continuity is sprawled on the floor, foaming at the mouth. Genetic science is right next to it.

But even on its own merits, ""Species III"" is a pretty bad movie. There's no real plot except Sara running around doing random things, while Dean frets about what will happen if they engineer more like her. Occasionally the half-breeds pop up to cause trouble, but they don't seem to have any real GOAL -- they just show up, expire in some way, and are immediately forgotten.

Dunne and John Paul Pitoc give decent performances as perpetually baffled grad students, and Robert Knepper chews the scenery like a termite. But the biggest fail is Mabrey. Where Natasha Henstridge's performances had warmth and humanity to offset her chilly alienness, Mabrey is basically a cold, bratty, emotionless machine who cares about nothing except what she wants. And the fact that Mabrey is a terrible, terrible actress doesn't help.

""Species II"" shows once again that the series should have stopped with the first -- this feels like a failed TV pilot, with no plot or likable characters. Give it a pass.",1367020800,2,3325,4.787085514834206

2163215,3,B00062IVNA,"Species (1995) was an edgy thriller featuring newcomer Natasha Henstridge, as the female alien Sil, seeking a human mate.  The story continued in Species II (1998), where the alien Eve (played by Henstridge), mated with an alien/human hybrid, only to be mortally injured at the conclusion of the film.  Species III (2004) takes up almost immediately after the events in Species II, and is kind of a rebirth for the saga, touching some of the themes first explored in the original movie.

The plot of Species III is complicated, very outlandish, and has some huge plot holes, but is still more thought out and well executed than the disastrous Species II.  The film may have a limited budget, but the money seems to have been spent where it counts, as the special effects are quite effective.

Natasha Henstridge makes a cameo as Eve, last seen at the end of Species II in an Army ambulance, after being gravely injured.  Having been impregnated by the a hybrid alien, she gives birth to a girl, and is killed by a ""half-breed"", one of the many offspring from the union of alien and human.  Abbott (Robert Knepper) the ambulance driver, is in the army reserve, and he takes the young girl to his home.  In civilian life, he is a college professor, and he raises young Sara in his basement lab.  Sara soon matures into an adult (Sunny Mabrey), kills her first human, and begins searching for a suitable mate.  Circumstances cause Abbott to take Dean (Robin Dunne), one of his students, as partner.

The half-breeds are dying, and want to locate Sara to see if she can play a role in continuing their genetic line.  One appears at Abbot's home, and he is killed, leaving Dean to take over.  Amelia  (Amelia Cooke) a sexy female half-breed is looking for a biochemist, and snares Dean's roommate Hastings (John Paul Pitoc) in her scheme.  This sets up an implausible and overdramatic confrontation at a power plant.

Directed by Brad Turner, Species III has some substantial credibility issues, but setting those aside, the film still presents a fairly coherent story, that manages to tie up most of the loose ends.  The special effects are well done, and play an essential role in the effectiveness of the film, that is targeted at a younger audience to try and revive the Species franchise.  Sara and Amelia represent a return to preeminence of the sexy female alien.  Unlike the original alien Sil, Sara isn't volatile and willing to kill at any moment, and Sunny Mabrey plays her as kind of an emotionless blank slate.  Struggling to survive, Amelia and the half-breeds contribute edgy aggressiveness.

The DVD contains some nice extras, including four production featurettes, and a commentary track by Brad Turner, Robin Dunne, and screen writer Ben Ripley.  Species III is pretty entertaining B-movie fare, that lifts the franchise up a little from the sinkhole that Species II had left it in.  The direct to video Species IV, would follow in 2007.",1281571200,,2950,4.809523809523809

2163218,2,B00062IVNA,"You know something is wrong with a movie when it's not released theatrically. And that it is exactly the case here. Species III was released in the Sci-Fi Channel in 2004 and shortly afterwards on DVD. Here in this 2nd sequel in the Species franchise we find another seductive alien on the loose only this time it is not played by Natasha Henstridge. The movie begins exactly where the last one left of, with Eve's body being loaded into the military truck, later on we find her giving birth to a pure breed Alien. The alien is taken by a scientist who for some unexplained reason is doing research on her species. Anyway just to give an insight this movie gives us a slight improvement over the previous entry... but its still garbage. The movie suffers from a lot especially bad lighting, which becomes excruciating after awhile. The acting is okay but the dialog is a bit confusing and sometimes for no real reason. The movie also has some minimal plot holes, such as half breeds still being alive after the 2nd picture (they were all killed supposedly in the barn in Specie II) and at times it suffers from poor character development, but other than that it can still be enjoyed as a comedy... because to me that's what this series really is... just on big cheesy sci-fi mess. Rent it or just watch it on the Sci-Fi channel when they air it.

2163222,4,B00062IVNA,This is the best of the trilogy. I believe this is a straight to video release but it is better than the usual of its ilk. The main reason being Ameilia Cooke's gas station scene.....,1157673600,5,183,4.257142857142857
2163223,2,B00062IVNA,"So this time we've got a new alien, played by Sunny Mabrey.  She's being raised by a college professor who spirited her away from the government just after the end of the last movie.  But there are also half-breed aliens, and they want to mate with her because their genes are all screwed up and they're dying from a whole host of diseases.  When one of them shows up at the college professor's office and dies, he calls in help from a brilliant grad student.  Soon, the alien starts to have ""feelings"" for this student, and the half-breed aliens attack.

This just wasn't terribly interesting, even for a direct-to-video movie.  The story didn't have much forward momentum to it and the conclusion was fairly unsatisfying.  The inclusion of the half-breed aliens didn't really serve any purpose except to put a stumbling block in front of the professor and his little science project.  As far as the characters, the hot babe alien didn't have any emotions, so that pretty much wrote her out of the story.  The professor and his student were just not very well developed and din't have any sort of personality traits that separated them from any other generic movie character.  The whole thing left me uninterested.  The worst part was there didn't seem to be any point to the story - what was the professor trying to do with the alien?  This was never made clear, so when it wasn't successful, well, who cares?

Considering all the attention given to this being ""unrated"", it really didn't have any more gore or nudity than an average R rated movie.",1148083200,4,1550,4.675276752767528
2163224,3,B00062IVNA,"First there was Sil.  Then we had her duplicate Eve.  Now we have Eve's daughter Sara.  Sara is closer to alien than her predecessors and is the charge of a university professor.  He is trying to analyze her DNA and create and even more perfect creation.  We also have a number of Hybrids (although Sil, Eve and Sara are also hybrids) who have agendas of their own.

As Sara matures her need to breed kicks in but she is unique and needs another with her level of alieness.  The professor takes on a student researcher to assist in his plans.  Although it is easy to learn from past mistakes, it is not easy to predict new ones and things begin to get out of hand.  Soon there are bodies to be hidden and aliens to deal with as well as the government once they manage to find out what is going on.

This one lacks the feeling and menace of the earlier films and is far more upbeat.  It is a different story from the first two and there is no explanation for the proliferation of the hybrids.  All in all it is not what one would look for if you wanted more of the same.  While different in many ways there is still good alien action and plenty of nudity like the original.  But if you want a development and not just a continuation, then you might really enjoy this one.

2163227,3,B00062IVNA,"Reminiscent of 50's sci-fi in that whomever wrote the script obviously drinks a lot, the acting doesn't always fit the scene being viewed, and there's a tendency to go right to T&A to keep you from noticing, which is fine by me, but I notice it anyway. The movie is pretty good visual look to it and the direction is adequate. However, the ending is nothing more than giving up for lack of anything better to do. As in, ""I don't know what to do here so somebody better start walking off into the sunset"".",1126310400,2,504,4.315789473684211
2163228,1,B00062IVNA,"Before you watch this direct-to-video sequel, keep the following things in mind.  For if I give a lowest star rating to this one, I have my own reasons for doing that.

First, Natasha Henstridge.  Though it is true that she is seen in 'Species III,' her appearance here does not even deserve the name of cameo.  True, Natasha Henstrige appears as 'Eve' (not Sil) in the opening scenes, but you can hardly recognize Ms. Henstridge (or her beautiful face) who keeps on lying in a dark, ill-lit vehicle, with her stomach blood-soaked.  Actually, Eve shows up to give birth to a baby, and the camera, which follows the gory alien-child birth scenes, moves as if forgetting that Natasha Henstridge is there.

Second, poor plot.  During the long 113 minutes, you just can't fully understand what is going on in 'Species III.'  A fame-hungry college professor Dr. Abott (Robert Knepper) somehow obtains Eve's baby, but the film never explains how.  Anyway, doctor names the baby girl Sara, and tries to raise her alone in his house.  Even though adult Sara (Sunny Mabrey) could be very dangerous, she is allowed to prowl around in the house, stark naked, giving us male audiences some guilty pleasure.

Things don't stop there.  For a hunky college student (Robin Dunne) also joins n the doctor's project, and plays a game of chess with her.  Moreover, there are a group of 'half-breeds' who keep coming on to Sara, looking for whatever I cannot remember.  One of them is called Amelia (Amelia Cooke), who is so intelligent that she uses the Internet to recruit her possible victim.  And her nudity is included (so, don't forget to check the unrated edition).

The script is muddled, giving us no thrills or whatever you might be looking for in this series, except, perhaps, nudity and gore.  Brad Turner (whose CV includes many episodes in the TV series like '24') makes the whole film look like a long, drawn-out pilot for some TV show.  The story is dull, the special effects are cheap, so is the murky photography, which lacks the sufficient lighting.  The fact that it was released with the MGM's roaring lion logo is the most shocking part of the film.",1119744000,5,2151,4.749326145552561
2163229,3,B00062IVNA,"I watched the first ""Species"" flick only recently and I enjoyed it rather well.  I gave it a strong three stars for its entertainment value.  While I've missed ""Species II,"" I did manage to watch this unrated version of ""Species III"" and I must say that it is a pretty good flick considering it went straight to DVD.

It is one of the best SciFi channel pictures I've seen in awhile.  Although the story is a little unbalanced, what with a scientist hoping to create a pure alien breed that would almost definitely destroy humanity, you actually pull for the lead characters in this flick.  Sunny Mabrey does an excellent job as Sara, the offspring of Eve who has achieved a near-perfect genetic build to survive on Earth.  Robert Knepper is good as the slightly mad scientist who hopes to create a perfect being.  The young man who assists him and eventually becomes the focus of the film is convincingly hesistant in helping Knepper.

The film plods along for the first half hour or so, but once Sara breaks from her cocoon and the half-breeds start seeking her out, things pick up.  One alien in particular, Amelia, gets pretty nasty in her hunt for Sara.  A male half-breed also does a number on Knepper, the grad student, and Sara.

Much like the original ""Species,"" this sequel has plenty of nudity and sex to appease the appetites of viewers, but it isn't the focal point of the film.

The special effects are very good, especially considering that SciFi channel had a hand in this production.  The aliens might be people in rubber suits for the most part, but that only adds to the realism of the creatures.  In fact, the only real glaring failure in this flick is when the CGI kicks in.  CGI looks fake, no matter what people think.  Just check out flicks like the latest ""Star Wars"" episode or ""Blade II"" if you don't believe me.  I have no real problem with CGI effects, but I hope that they become more realistic with time.  Thankfully, CGI use is pretty thin in ""Species III.""

Oh, and in case your wondering, the film does end on a high note and a slight hint at another sequel.  I don't think one will be made, but like any good sci-fi franchise, there is always a window left open for the future.

I recommend this film to fans of the other ""Species"" flicks.  If you enjoy B-movies on SciFi like I do, this will definitely be an upgrade for you.  I think that SciFi fans in general will enjoy this film, it isn't as bad as some say it is.",1118707200,13,2454,4.440715883668904
2163230,1,B00062IVNA,"This movie is nothing but cheap porn, don't bother its just an excuse to show off some ugly chicks boobs and just focuses on the straight male's want to see a naked woman.

2163231,1,B00062IVNA,"I guess I shouldn't be so hard on this film because it is in it's place, being a straight-to-video production and all. But if MGM was so inclined to shortchange the funding for Species III, then why even waste the little money they threw at it? It's not like you could've really expected anything good to come out of it.

Aside from the cheap effects, flying stuntmen in prosthetics who are obviously on wires, bad acting, (which is all excusable for the low-budget) is the horrendously boring storyline, which in an attempt to take the series in a new direction, fails completely (not excusable). Plus the climax was probably the least exciting climax I've seen for a while. And there's enough plot holes that this film could be a slice of Swiss cheese. This will be the last Species film I ever watch. I'm not going to waste money on Species 4, which will even have less money than this did to work with.",1114992000,4,906,4.524390243902439

2163233,5,B00062IVNA,"After the first installment of Species and its sequel  Species 2,  the new  Species 3  marks a welcome change in the evolution of the series. If the previous two installments were horror movies, the new episode is more science-fiction. The original was out to create anxiety, whereas  Species 3  actually generates some interesting character development, with the first suggestion that scientists dabbling with alien DNA aren't complete idiots after all.

In the first film, a distant planet sent a genetic sequence to Earth, which proved a luring recipe for disaster for a team of scientists who followed the instructions and wound up creating Syl (Natasha Henstridge). In no time at all, Syl grew into a creature who looks much of the time like an incredibly beautiful woman, driven to reproduce with - and kill - any human males she deems appropriate. In  Species 2,  a clone of the original Syl mated with an astronaut.  Species 3  starts with a dying Syl giving birth to a child, who is swiftly appropriated and hidden away by Dr. Abbott (Robert Knepper), a university professor who is avidly curious and singularly nonjudgmental. With the self-named Sarah growing as an adult (Sunny Mabrey) in a couple of days, Dr. Abbott needs a bit of help and hires student Dean (Robin Dunne) to help him come up with a set of eggs. It seems that Syl left behind a legacy of decaying half-breeds who want Sarah to mate with them and continue their line. Meanwhile, the half-breeds aren't above some turmoil, and since Sarah comes from a lethal line herself ...

Ben Ripley's script goes in various unexpected directions, so that Sarah's conduct is truly unpredictable - we really don't know if she will be good or vicious in any given circumstances. This in turn makes Abbott and Dean seem more like authentic scientists rather than stereotypical horror movie enablers. The sequences with the naked Sarah and an aggressive half-breed called Amelia is really enticing (yeah, we know, they're aliens, they may sprout tentacles and kill somebody, but still ...), and they are undeniably scenic. The intrigue mechanics are definitely interesting. The characters are likeably original, with a nicely dry turn from Knepper and a credible performance as a dangerous above suspicion from the dazzling Mabrey.

IThe movie has a thoroughly filmlike appearance, with vivid colors and great definition in dark scenes. There are some nice, subtle effects of background machinery in Chapter 6 and a successful startling blast of music at the party in Chapter 13.

The audio commentary with director Turner, writer Ripley and actor Dunne is pleasant and instructive. There are four making-of segments -  Evolution  on casting and pre-production,  Species DNA  on production design, with designer Cameron Birnie illuminating on the wish to make the environments  uncomfortable  to look at -  Alien Technology,  which contrasts shots before and after the addition of CGI, and  Intelligent Lifeforms,  a decent segment on the creature design. A photo gallery is also included.

Species 3  does have the impact of the original, in an innovative way, it feels more consistent - the characters are certainly more appealing. It emerges as a more than agreeable and sexy SF diversion.",1113350400,11,3254,5.069548872180451
2163234,3,B00062IVNA,"Far cry from an actual thearetical release movie.  It still gives off a low-budget feel with a average plotline that takes away from the orginial and 2nd movie.  With acting that is sub-par the movie gives off that cheesy feeling of watching a C-rated horror film, although this one is definately a B-rated movie.  Good Special Effects dominate this film and drive it to become a great TV movie that would be perfect to watch at 11 pm at night when you are in the mood for a cheesy film.",1113091200,,487,4.388888888888889

2163236,5,B00062IVNA,"This film is one of the most fascinating picture-descriptions of man's struggle with both himself and the unknown.  In shots somehow framed richly as velvet, Turner is still able to convey the cold inhumanity of the Species characters, and yet in every scene allow each character's patina of opposite completing emotions come to light.  Thus cold characters are shown their warm side and the inhuman characters tug at our guts as if *they* are the must anthropic characters in the film.

All the while, Turner is able in this epic to capture the suspense of ""Alien"" as well as the loathing-feeling of ""Silent Running.""  Additionally, it is clear that the creators of this film paid great attention to gothic horror, as many of the elements are heavilly (and skillfully) borrowed from Mary Shelley herself!!!

By all means own this film!",1110844800,4,836,4.942857142857143
2163237,3,B00062IVNA,"You can't help but get involved in this ridiculous mess, the third and probably not the last in the SPECIES assembly line.  Natasha Henstridge is back but she's killed off early, so she's not really a part of the movie.  There are so many gaping plot holes that one wonders how the director edited the final cut.  Questions:  where does the little boy come from in the opening sequence? All of a sudden, he's just there.  2.  Why does the scientist who saves the alien baby enlist the help of Dean, who he so blatantly chastised in their first scene?  3.  Why doesn't anyone seem concerned about the notable absences of the college's dean and the abherrent professor?  These are just a few of the many questions left unanswered.  The cast is mundane, although Robert Knepper has one of the most overblown death scenes in recent cinema history.  The low budget hurts the film, but if you enjoyed the first two, you can probably stomach this one, and the ending definitely leaves room for a fourth.  That's either good or bad news, depending on where you stand after this entry.",1109462400,,1076,4.605263157894737

The plot of Species 3 centers around a crazy scientist who thinks growing planet-devouring alien monsters is a good idea. He ropes another dope into his scheme and they take turns cleaning up after the half monster/half hoochie.

2163239,2,B00062IVNA,"Okay folks, the first half of Species, the original movie actually made a genuine effort into being a ""good movie"".  The ""b horror flick"" ending we were given let open the door for a downgraded cast to return and plod through a mish-mash plot just to get to another alien sex-hack-fest.  Now we roll around to Species III, which probably broke its budget convincing Nastasha Henstridge to come back as a corpse ""just one more time... I promise"".  If you bought this or are going to rent this with hopes of seeing her run around naked for half the movie, go back to species I and II, she doesn't do much of anything in this flick.  Taking the ""species"" genre yet one more direction it shouldn't go, this junk adds the element of ""half-breeds"".  Half human - half alien messes that run around with bad immune systems that need their genomes jacked up and patched in order to live.  The crux of this movie is a bunch of grad. students and a professor trying to make a pure strain of ""the alien"" that can live on earth.  (cause the fame of creating a new species is totally worth wrecking the native population of a planet)I'll spare you more wonderous plot points and just get down to brass tacks: The goods: Yet another naked chick running around being ""an alien"".  The bads: H.R. Geiger did enough when he helped inspire the whole ""alien"" series of movies... (the first 2 are excellent).  But the species movies are just cheap knock offs that have sexual overtones and ""alienized"" human bodies fight and have sex a bunch of times. (hmmm... maybe that isn't too bad...)The uglies: We are treated to no less than 4 takes of a gate to the dorm room of the ""grad students"" opening and closing, poor rubber suits (species II atleast had CGI), an even MORE retarded ending than species I or II and of course the opportunity for a species IV!!!
