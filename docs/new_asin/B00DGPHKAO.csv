5798179,4,B00DGPHKAO,"No-one however could possibly lay any kind of claim for there being anything like a credible plot or even credible characters in Matilde di Shabran, and musically, it's a bit Rossini on autopilot, but if writing for entertainment alone is justification enough for an opera, then that's certainly what Rossini delivers here.  The work's true potential moreover is fully realised at the Rossini Opera Festival by some of the best Rossinian performers in the world today.

The plot however is just ridiculous.  Corradino, the Ironheart, is a fearsome warrior (""a lion, an ogre, a devil""), who resides in a dark castle on a hill, with dire pronouncements placed around to strike fear into the hearts of the local villagers. The woman who is intent on storming Corradino's castle (metaphorically speaking) is of course Matilde di Shabran.  Matilde has been left as a ward to Corradino by her father on his deathbed, the old man for some inexplicable reason thinking it was a great idea to entrust his daughter to a notorious hater of women, a man devoted entirely to war, havoc, slaughter and inflicting as much misery and fear into the world as is humanly possible.  When Matilde does turn up on the scene then, Corradino obviously wants to slaughter this hateful but curiously attractive example of the fairer sex.  But what is this?  Something stays his hand.  Could it be love?  Could the Ironheart be melting?  So why then does Corradino still feel such pangs of betrayal when it appears that she has released one of his prisoners and even a tinge of regret that he has had her executed...?

If you find that you're fully entertained for over three and a half hours by the thin ludicrous plot that passes for drama (or indeed comedy) here, then it's almost entirely down to Rossini's galloping, spinning and spiralling score.  With Juan Diego Flrez and Olga Peretyatko in the principal roles moreover, you know it's also going to be sung as well as it can be.  Even then though, both singers more than surpass expectations.  Dramatically they don't have a lot to work with, and there's a lot of mugging going on, but Flrez's singing is still without peer in this tenor register, making an extremely difficult role look easy.  The same goes for the gorgeous songbird flutterings of Olga Peretyatko's flawless coloratura, but her unparalleled brilliance of this type of Rossini role is evident in her entire performance.  It would be apparent to anyone that you are witnessing two of the best Rossini performers in the world here at their best.

You would be hard pressed however to find flaws in the other performances either with Paolo Bordogna providing a good comic turn as Isidoro, Anna Goryachova a fine Edoardo and Chiara Chialli a suitably mean Countess.  Simon Orfilia also makes a good impression as Ginardo, but is rather wasted in such a small role.  Michele Mariotti races the orchestra through the work with no great subtlety, which is exactly the manner in which it should be played.  There's not a lot to say about Mario Martone's direction or the stage design other than it's functional and perfectly suitable.  The setting is generically period, the depiction of Corradino's castle, towers and dungeon is created through an all-purpose large double spiral staircase that remains static in place throughout, although it spins for effect at one or two key moments.

There are no extra features on the Blu-ray, but the recording is excellent and this is great value for a highly entertaining three and a half hour opera with extraordinary performances in a solid presentation.  The Blu-ray is region free, full-HD, with subtitles in Italian, English, French and German.",1376611200,6,3682,4.922330097087379

8593019,5,B00DGPHKAO,"Matilde di Shabran or Beauty and Heart of Iron, is a rarely performed melodrama in two acts by Gioachino Rossini recently released on DVD from the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro - 2012. Forget about the plot or staging ....this is about 3.5 hours of sublime music and Bel Canto fireworks of such a magnitude that I can only surmise it languished in opera purgatory, because no one could sing it; it seems humanly impossible! That is untilJuan Diego Flrez and Olga Peretyatko came along to sing the principle rolls of Beauty (Matilde) and the Beast (Corradino). I am not sure there is anyone else in the world who can sing these roles so effortlessly without breaking a sweat. And yes as one reviewer points out the guys will fall in love with Olga.",1429228800,3,750,4.604477611940299
8593020,5,B00DGPHKAO,"Yes, the plot is not much, the sets are minimal and it's 3 1/2 hours long.  But the singing is wonderful!  As others have pointed out, Juan Diego Florez and Olga Peretyatko give absolutely world class performances, their singing is pure bliss.  I also especially enjoyed Anna Goryakova in the trouser role of Eduardo.  This young mezzo soprano has one of the lushest voices I've heard, beautiful from top to bottom, and I look for her to do more roles in the future.  The comic role of Isidoro is sung by Paolo Bordogna, who had the additional challenge that his role is in Neopolitan dialect, not standard Italian, increasing memorization difficulties (of course for all I know, he may be from Naples).  The Blu Ray comes with a booklet that explains the history of the opera, and gives the synopsis.  There are actually a few errors in the synopsis, beginning with a mis-identification of some of the characters in the opening scene, but this doesn't really diminish the enjoyment of this wonderful disc.  The conducting is also top notch, and the large ensembles, such as a quintet and a sextet, show Rossini at his finest.",1419552000,3,1126,4.7384615384615385
8593021,5,B00DGPHKAO,"When I read the reviews I thought that buying the DVD was a good choice.
Even though the story of this opera is hard to believe in real life its nice to see that goodness and love win over cruelty and madness.

 Some of the situations in the opera were very humorous such as Corradinos( played by Juan Diego Flores) transformation brought about by Matildes ( Olga Peretyatko) love. Also Isidoro (Paolo Bordogna) has some very comic moments. But then we had Edoardos (played by Anna Gortachova) touching scenes with his father.

The cast was outstanding; there were only a few areas, but many ensembles which required very good singers, some parts of this music were performed by only one singer who had the opportunity to show his or her abilities.

The different storylines including the humorous ones were very well sang and produced making  this  beautiful  opera one that can be enjoyed by everyone even by those not familiar with opera.",1407628800,,941,4.771604938271605
8593022,4,B00DGPHKAO,"After all the praise heaped on this opera semiseria disc I must say- Sorry  this mass mess needs pruning! After some four hours both singers and audience need to rethink what is this all about. The story line is one of the weakest in all of Rossini operas and was weakened by Rossini's habitual procrastination and in Mathilde's case even more so. Rehersals for the opera had already begun before the the composing had finished. Rossini found himself so pinched for time that he had another composer, G Pacini who was in Rome at the time, to supply music for parts of Act 2. He lifted that absolutely delightful 'Simfonia' at the begining of the work from his own 'Eduardo e Cristina' (1819) (not an unknown practice at the time) and several sections, coro and penultimate section of Act 2 from from his 'Riccardo e Zoraide' (1818). On the day of the dress rehersal the sets weren't yet finished. The concertmaster and the first horn player had nervous fits so that the great Paganini led the orchestra for the premiere and played the long horn part of Act 2 aria ""Ah perche perche la morte"" on the viola. Even Paganini couldn't bring off the premiere of this hobbled mess without several mishaps. Thus the audience gave it a cool reception and the opera house impressario was unhappy with Rossini. The first performance took place at the Apollo Theatre  Rome, 24 February 1821 (note the many referances to Apollo in Isidoro's lines). This was Rossini's thirty second opera.
Subsequently a revision of the score was done for Naples and the Pacini material was excised and replaced with Rossini composed material. It played in Vienna, London, New York and Paris but died out after 1830  and has seldom been done since. Mostly because of the severe vocal requirements. We are very fortunate to have Florez and Peretyatko.
So what species is Matilde di Shabran? It's certainly not 'opera buffa'. Sometimes 'Matilde' was listed as Melodrama giocoso. But musicologists say that it doesn't fit that category. Presently the consensus is that it was similar enough in content and feeling that it could fit the mood of some of Rossini's other 'opera semiseria such as 'Torvaldo e Torliska' and 'La Gazza Ladra'. Since it is light in spirit but has dark clouds that come in and threaten to evoke a tragedy but this is averted and all ends happily. This was Rossini's last opera semiseria.
In summary 'Matilde' is too much of a good thing. The story line is so thin it cannot hold together that much music. The score sparkles yet it's really a series of lush quartettos, quintettos and coros with no cross references to unite them as we have in the more tightly organized 'La Donna del Lago' or 'Tancredi'. The music here is beautiful and what to discard is the dilemma. Maybe over two days? But of couse I'd be impatiently awaiting my favorite section (after the 'Simfonia') and that is the brilliant Mathilde's scena e rondo e finale secundo with Olga sounding just as fresh (and in the same dress) as when she stepped onstage some four hours ago.

8593025,5,B00DGPHKAO,"Once again, The Rossini Opera Festival has released an excellent dvd of a recent performance, this time the rarely seen Matidle di Shabran.  And it is a winner on all fronts.

First, let's start with the opera itself.  This is an ""opera semisera"", which is, in fact, a different animal from a buffo comedy.  The tone of such a piece (like ""la Gazza Ladra"") is largely comic, sometimes with quite uproarious situations and staging.  But about half way through, it becomes much darker, with the hero/heroine being threatened by real bad consequences- condemned to death here.  The tone then become quite a bit darker (not farcically so, but actually so), before a happy ending where all is righted, and the hero(ine) reprieved.

Here, Corradino (villain) is a woman hater/everything hater and, though not evil, impossible to like.  His comic servants (nothing new here) get along as best they can, though the villagers fear him.  He is pursued ion marriage by the Countess D'Arco, who, though he refuses to marry her, has nonetheless extracted a promise that he won't marry anyone else.  But then arrives Matilde, determined to marry him and change his negative ways.  She succeeds in emotionally seducing him.  But the Countess causes Corradino to believe that Matilde has set a prisoner of war free, and so she is ordered killed.  In the end, of course, her buffo executioner cannot carry out the order, the truth comes out, and Corradino and Matilde end up together.

The music is largely comic- which, of course, means that it is Rossini at his best (""Make more Barbers,"" Beethoven is reportedly said to have lectured Rossini.)  There are much fewer full (double) arias in this piece than is usual- most are duets/ensemble numbers.  Matilde, for example, not only does not get an entrance aria, she doesn't get one at all- except for an extended opening piece in the finale to the opera.  But the ensembles are the highlight of the score- comic, surging with Rossini momentum and total fun.  Matilde's entrance is a terrific duet with Doctor Aliprando (Nicola Alaimo- terrific).  The highlight for me is the big quintet (which by all appearances AND STRUCTURE is the first Act finale but is actually only about 2/3 of the way through the act) with Matilde, Countess, Corradino and two comic foils (Isidoro- a wandering poet and Ginardo).  Delightful.  The opera finale is an extended one with terrific singing by Matilde in particular.  The score is a lengthy (over 3  hours) musical feast.

As for the performers, let me get this right out here- I'm in love with the gorgeous Olga Peretyatko as Matilde.  I loved her in Pesaro's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sigismondo-Blu-ray/dp/B008P76W5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sigismondo [Blu-ray</a>] from the previous year (see my review).  She is even better here.  The part is substantial, and her comic flair is present throughout.  Her coloratura, especially in the finale, is exceptional.  Count me in as seeing a long successful career for her. (She debuts next April 2014 at the Met Opera in ""I Puritani"" by Bellini, which would appear to be a perfect role for her.)  Did I say she is absolutely beautiful?- the latest gorgeous soprano to hit the international opera scene.  Wonderful.

As for the rest of the cast, all are terrific.  Juan Diego Florez is just terrific with his coloratura (and high tessitura), and makes this very difficult role just seem so easy (it isn't).  This role was his international coming out in Pesaro about 15 years ago, so this is familiar territory for him.  The comic roles of isidoro (Paolo Bordogna), Aliprando (Nicola Alaimo), Ginardo (Simon Orfila) and Countess (Chiari Chialli) are all done superbly.  Sets and costume are just fine.

I do want to say a word about the technical aspects of this release (I have the blu ray).  The filming (by Tiziano Mancini (who is doing most of the Italian telecasts these days including much of the Tutti Verdi series) is excellent.  The cameras never miss the correct moment, no shaky cameras, and the hi def filming is excellent.  So smooth that it is easy to overlook.  The sound (including body mikes) and subtitles are just right.  Finally, I do want to highlight the excellent booklet with the release.  There is a very informative history of the opera and decent synopsis.  Much better than one usually gets.

I will point out that there are NO extras on the dvd at all.  Frankly, this, to me, is inexcusable.  Rare operas cry out for a documentary which discusses the opera, preferably with comments by the singers, conductor, director, etc.  The performers are all-around when this is being filmed.  Grabbing a few for a 5 minute interview to include on the dvd, again, especially for such a rare piece, would seem, to me, the minimal that should be done.  (But at least we do have a fine booklet.)

All in all, a terrific dvd and highly recommended one.  You will love the music and Ms. Olga, I'm sure.",1380153600,14,4985,4.951749095295537
8593026,5,B00DGPHKAO,"I have to admit from the start that I absolutely loved Matilde di Shabran since I first heard it as 2006 audio only release of Pesaro production and to be able to watch it finally and with even better cast is a dream comes true for me. I think music is first rate Rossini, not auto-pilot, especially ensemble pieces, which are among the best Rossini had ever written. I don't have any problems with the plot neither, yes it's a broad slapstick tongue-to-chick comedy, sort of Beauty and The Beast meets The Taming of The Shrew, but it's precisely the genre where Rossini still reigns supreme and with a capable cast it's a total delight. So, I don't think the music or the story were the real reasons why this opera went into oblivion for a century and a half - after its premiere in Rome in 1821, London in 1821 and New York in 1834, they were just a couple of staging until almost the end of 20th century. During all this time, there was simply no tenor capable of doing justice to extremely difficult role of Corradino. Juan Diego Florez, at age of 23, shot to international stardom at the Rossini Opera Festival in 1996, covering it for a famous tenor who had cancelled. He also performed it in 2004, 2008 and 2012, when it was finally video recorded. We're lucky to experience here a great artist, who `lived' with the role for 16 years and made it its own. His singing seems effortless in the most treacherous of passages , tone is consistently gorgeous in rapid-fire coloratura runs and in slow dreamy legato lines, phrasing is exquisite, endless high notes are soaring. And Florez is obviously having great fun playing Corradino, a role that allows him to show not only physical comedy skills, but real development of the character from ferocious brute to remorseful and appreciative husband.
Olga Peretyatko is also wonderful as Matilde, a Beauty with brains and will power to tame The Beast, and with pure heart to fall in love with him. Her voice is rich and smooth, technique is flawless and top notes are shining. She gives an impression that impossible final rondo poses no particular challenges for her.  In addition, Peretyatko is a very elegant and graceful stage animal, and I'm sure in the future she will gain that special edge of brilliance only years of experience can bring. I hope to see her alive soon, she makes her debut as Elvira at the Met this season. The rest of the cast is top drawer too, Anna Goryachova as Edoardo, Paola Bordogna as Isidoro and Nicola Alaimo as Aliprando are perfect for their roles. Michele Mariotti's conducting is of high caliber we're used to expect from him in recent years, true to composer, very musical and attentive to the needs of the singers.
Mario Martone's traditional staging shows how much fun an opera can be if director simply follows the music and text in good taste and creates a functional set and appropriate costumes, instead of working against a piece to make it appealing to some fictional `modern audience' by introducing totally irrelevant ideas and concepts. Martone obviously spent a lot of time working with singers on their characters, because all cast members are simply superb acting wise and altogether they form an unbeatable team that will keep you glued to your seat for 3+ hours, savoring every second of it.

Overall, I can't praise this recording high enough! Buy it! If you were familiar with this opera, it will surpass everything you ever heard! If you have never experienced it, the more reason to buy it, you don't know what you're missing!",1378684800,24,3536,4.69243156199678
