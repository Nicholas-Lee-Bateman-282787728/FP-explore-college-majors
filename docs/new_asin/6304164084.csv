796791,5,6304164084,"Japanese title is Macross and quite long TV animation saga with major 6 series. Macross is the name of giant spaceship populated with 56,000 civilian refugees. Macross keeps on sailing nowhere fighting with aliens. Through all episode, music takes great part to the extent to soften enemy's heart.  I love Macross 7 TV series best.

7863440,5,6304164084,Love the subtitles they were missing in the dvd. Such a warm storyline for a short series it told the truth of what if and gave me a glimpse of the realities of close to light speed travel. Nothing close. Fast delivery great service,1387324800,,232,4.295454545454546
7863441,5,6304164084,Story starts really good. It brings me memories when I was a kid. Plot is being introduced. Anime category classified as classic.,1358121600,,129,4.909090909090909

Noriko Takaya is a young woman training to become a part of the ""Top Squadren"", a group of the best RX-7 pilots to fight a war against an enemy she knows little about. Meeting the hard training Kazumi Amano, russion RX-7 pilot Jung Freud, and with help from her coach and trainer Kouichiro ""Coach"" Ohta, Noriko must conquer her fears about her past. Will her father's death cause her to become depressed, or will she fight on?
The first volume of Gunbuster starts off a bit slow, but does well to develop the characters we do meet. With what we see of this universe so far, it's a very interesting OVA. For an older anime, this still stands out a great deal with great animation quality and music. The voice acting for the japanese voices are very good, and while the subtitles are older and not quite as accurate as subtitles are today, it's nothing to complain about. There is also a bit of fanservice in this OVA, but it's not a big complaint either, as it's not the focus of the show.
Another interesting part of this anime, is how Einstein's theory of space and time are put into play here. I won't spoil it, all I will say is watch the anime and find out for yourself how important a role this science theory will play.
Gunbuster volume 1 is off to a great start, and we can only wait and see what'll happen in the next 4 episodes.",1112054400,,1440,4.337037037037037
7863443,4,6304164084,"I initially rented this OVA series because it was directed by Hideaki Anno of ""Evangelion"" and ""Nadia"" fame. And believe me, even though ""Gunbuster"" was early in Anno's career, his work shines through! While not as mind-blowing as ""Eva"", 1989's ""Gunbuster"" was still more than a typical giant robot anime.
The first episode was cute, and a nice setup for things to come, but nothing all that fantastic on its own. We meet the main characters and a few supporting ones who will prove important later on. The heroine, Nariko, is not at all unlike ""Eva""'s Shinji. For that matter, her mentor Amano bears some small similarity to Misato. The setting is part girl's high school and part mecha training facility. The funniest thing about this episode is the sight of all those giant robots doing pushups, jumping rope, and jogging (this is how the girls develop their piloting skills).
Episode two takes Noriko and Amano into space to join the war against the aliens. There they meet Russian pilot Jung-Freud and her mecha the Soviet (painted a lot like the Rocket Red character from the Justice League). Jung-Freud is the original Asuka, sporting red hair, an ego, and a competetive spirit. This episode also introduces the director's fascination with the ""science"" aspect of science fiction. There are some interesting and original concepts that have to do with space, warp drives, and even time travel (sorta).
All in all, the first volume of ""Gunbuster"" is enjoyable and prompts enough interest to see what happens next. And having seen them all, I'll tell you right now it's worth it.",1010707200,,1583,4.91044776119403

7863445,5,6304164084,"This is such an unlikely addition to my collection. I'm a fan of Japanese Animation, but I put this whole film in a list of my favorite movies all time. This was such an enjoyable ride, watching this young girl grow up and  take responsibility for herself, and in the process, saving the world! This  has to be the best Japanese Animated movie I've ever seen, and it's a shame  that things like Sailor Moon get so popular and fantastic movies like this  are barely watched. Pokemon is not a show of what the Japanese can do with  animation. Give Gunbuster a chance...",963878400,2,567,4.466019417475728
