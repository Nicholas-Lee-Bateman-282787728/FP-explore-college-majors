8306361,4,B001GOEY4M,"Like all the Wulin out-of-print series, this DVD is a combination of a full reference demonstration by an old master, along with a full demonstration by a young and capable student, and then those recorded sets are broken down into sections - and postures within sections - by chopping up the recordings of the demonstrations. After that is a few demonstrations of applications, which is entertaining but not terribly convincing.

There's no info provided on the lineage of this Bagua Dragon Form Palm (Bagua Long Xing Zhang). We are told only that Zhao Ziqiu was born in 1904 and his performance was recorded in 1985, so he was 81 yrs old at the time. It has a bit of similarity to the dragon bagua of Fu Zhen Song and a little resemblance to Yin Fu style.

This form is pleasant to watch, twisty and fluid, but does not require any extreme flexibility or athleticism (as attested by the performance of the 81 yr old). The routine is not very long and is broken into 36 postures. Since this Wulin series has no real instruction, just demonstrations, it is up to the viewer to be motivated enough to interpret and incorporate the movements into a complete bagua set.",1524355200,,1166,4.628019323671498
