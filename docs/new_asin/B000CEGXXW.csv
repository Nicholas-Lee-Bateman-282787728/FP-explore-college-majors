8098083,5,B000CEGXXW,"We received this as a gift for my one year old son because they know we are raising him to be bilingual. We didn't think he would pay much attention but he LOVES it. Its the only thing he can watch for more than two minutes. He watches all of the segments and i can honestly see that he is quite intrigued and is ""learning"". Would highly recommend it!!",1288051200,,352,4.115942028985507
8098084,5,B000CEGXXW,I own a lot of educational videos and I have to say this is one of the best ones. Plus you can't beat the price! I'm a Spanish native speaker and the translation and pronunciation are very good. The images are great because are real images and the babies showing in the screen keep my daughter engaged. I highly recommend this product for people that want to raise their kids bilingual or want them to learn either language. It is a great start. I'm actually looking for more products from this company.,1249862400,,503,4.478260869565218
8098085,5,B000CEGXXW,"I bought this product with great caution and was not expecting too much (due to only 2 reviews, and the rather 'home made' appearance of the cover. I was very plesantly surprised with the DVD. My two young children adore it, and have requested it for over 2 weeks now!! The quality of the recording is very good, the bilingual approach is very well done, and the use of children and daily activites in the dialogue seems to capture my kids attention. I would highly recomend this as a way to start introducing spanish to younger children. My 2 year old is already saying some of the spanish words before they appear... so the idea works.",1174262400,,637,4.5
8098086,5,B000CEGXXW,"This is my childs favorite video! It hold her attention through-out the entire time. She loves the babies popping in and out. She shakes her bootie to the music and interacts with each segment. During the summary of what was just viewed, she tries to say the words. In just two days she learned two of the words from the video. It is also wonderful to have optional languages. She gets very excited and delighted when watching it. There is nothing on the market that we have seen that has been this wonderful and gotten such a great response from our child. What a fun way to learn!  Looking forward to more volumes.",1136073600,,616,4.451327433628318
8098087,5,B000CEGXXW,This was one of the best children's videos I've ever seen.  My children enjoyed the video very much especially the cute little babies that popped up.  They sat through the whole thing and even learned some Spanish words after only one viewing.  I would recommend this video to all my mom friends.,1134604800,,296,4.653846153846154
