7480408,5,B016WRX6UK,"Very talented at teaching this complex content. I was absolutely dreading studying for this exam. In one of the videos, she imitates a pancreas eating itself and I'm telling you, I've never in my life laughed so hard at an instructor while learning, ever. I've looked forward to each video ever since. Without question the best prep available. Use these videos with the Barron's book and the Pass CCRN online question bank and you'll absolutely kill it.",1485734400,17,453,4.896103896103896

7480413,4,B016WRX6UK,"I bought the DVD's off Laura's website. I really enjoyed the lectures and they were very informative. However I would not use this by itself to study. I used these DVD's to get a good baseline then did the PASS CCRN review questions online. Combined this was very helpful but the DVD's were lacking in some content that was on the exam. They did not cover respiratory or cardiac very in depth so I did some additional reading with the PASS CCRN materials. Overall, a good place to start studying.",1455667200,26,496,4.522222222222222

8737418,4,B016WRX6UK,"The package was opened when I received this item. Someone has opened it and re taped the package probably thinking there is more than inside than a DVD review. All the DVDs were intact so that is why I did not return it.
I have given this a 4- star because the lecture especially in the cardiac areas should be updated. What I like about the DVD review is a fun learning. You learn as well as you laugh. I have both the CD and DVD as well as I attended the 2 days seminar by Dr. Gasparis. I listened to her CD while driving, running and working out. I learned by listening and visualing her lectures. Both the CD and DVD helped me retained the information. I have not taken the CCRN test yet.  I will be taking the test soon. So, I will update my review after I take my test.",1528502400,,775,4.065359477124183

8737426,3,B016WRX6UK,Many people have recommended Laura's program for CCRN review so I purchased the CDs. She is hysterical to watch and listen to and she has great knowledge so I have learned some things. I think the content needs to be updated though. I will continue to watch her CDs in preparation for testing but I will need other sources of study too.,1492041600,8,336,4.435483870967742
