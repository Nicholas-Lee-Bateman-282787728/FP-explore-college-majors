8364170,2,B002CLKOTW,"I bought several dance-instruction DVDs to learn these dances.  This particular DVD was chosen because there are so few decent Rumba instruction DVDs to choose from (and I find it useful to look at more than one instructor's approach to a dance since I expect to dance with many different types of partners). Given that I had other DVDs for comparison, I can report that this is a hilarious product!
The instructional couple are very tall and thin. Their approach is cold and technical -- no styling. (There is one demonstration of the Man's and Lady's steps for each exercise -- no endless repetitions with an instructor counting out the beat, so be prepared to repeat the tracks.) The names given to the steps are deceiving; the same steps are demonstrated on other instructional videos using other names. For example, the ubiquitous Crossover Break is called the ""New Yorker"" in the Cha Cha exercises. I found one step (the ""Fan"") with two possible closings that were not also demonstrated on other instructional DVDs that I purchased.
This was the only video I purchased with European instructors. Perhaps they could not speak English to add those helpful little tips that Shawn Trautman or Vick Regan toss in during their instructional videos?",1358208000,,1248,4.942857142857143
