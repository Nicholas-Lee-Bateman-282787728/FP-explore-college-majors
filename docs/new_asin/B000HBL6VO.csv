8710198,5,B000HBL6VO,"In his autobiography, Open, Andre stated that this interview was a low point for him because he professed to love the game  from an earlier age (which if you know anything about Andre Agassi is not the case).

What I think Andre missed in that assessment was how revealing the interview is about the personal, about how he thinks and feels, about his acute sense of self-awareness and his approach to self-reflection and self-understanding.

Every time I watch this interview, and there has been many times, I find myself motivated to do better, to push my goals farther and to make a difference.

I am a huge Andre Agassi fan; this interview, for me, just reinforces why.",1359504000,,672,4.717948717948718
