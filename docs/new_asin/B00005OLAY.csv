7948999,4,B00005OLAY,"While this Holiday Special will never rank up there with A Charlie Brown Christmas or the Grinch, it still possesses a certain charm and capable work from it's voice talent.
The late Phil Hartman does some excellent voice work as he performs several roles in this animated flick. And in hindsight, it shows his acting ability away from Saturday Night Live and NewsRadio.
The script was by Romeo Muller, who DID write some of the best Rankin Bass Christmas specials such as Rudolph, the Little Drummer Boy, and others. Regretably, this was one of his last before passing away a few years later.
I believe on the clamshell edition of this movie, there is about a fifteen minute ""extra"" that goes into Romeo Mueller's life and work. Not bad overall,
Should come out on DVD.
Not the greatest, but not bad either.  And it's fun in a sort of Abbott and Costello way. The way some old black and white movies aren't great, but mindless fun; and there are times when you don't want to be bombarded with serious stuff
Sincerely,
