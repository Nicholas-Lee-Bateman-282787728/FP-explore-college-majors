1318397,1,B00003CXTO,"I wasted 2 valuable hours on this piece of garbage. Eddie Griffin and Orlando jones are WASTED in this movie. You can tell that they have true raw comedic talent, but the script doesn't do anything to really showcase their abilities. Griffin was funny for like 5 seconds and then he becomes just plain annoying. Everything about this movie is like an overstuffed burrito: JUST PLAIN MESSY. I must've laughed about 2 times during the entire movie. If you MUST see this movie, don't buy it, don't rent it, just borrow it. Trust me, whoever you borrow it from is going to be eager to part with it.",995328000,,594,4.5092592592592595
1318398,5,B00003CXTO,This movie starts off with fantastic scenes where the two stars (orlando and eddie) are complaining or making funny gestures and jokes. The first time i saw this movie i was like WHOA!!!!!! then i saw it again by then the movie was almost out of the thearters. i was so dissapointed when it wasn't there. so i really couldn't wait until this moment the pre-order day!!!! This movie really kicks a**!!!!!!!!!!!!!,992563200,,411,4.722222222222222
1318399,2,B00003CXTO,"Have you ever had a rotten day and come home to see your wife cheating on you, your brother teaching your kids to take drugs, your mom sleeping with the cable repair guy, your dog vommiting on your expensive leather coat....
If this didn't happened to you as it did to me about 1 week ago before seeing this movie in theaters, then nothing can prepare you properly for the theatrical viewing of Double Take.  When I first entered the theater I quickly noticed the jokes were in the seats. Not in my entire lifetime had I seen a theater so empty. Since I was arriving from a bar to meet my girlfriend and her friend, the few who were in the theater must've had time to prepare for this movie as they were already cozzied up in their favorite sleeping bags.
Unfortunately, I couldn't help but get dragged into this one, my girlfriend's friend really really wanted to see it, and its impossible to argue with her since her favorite motions are a swift kick... Anyways, half asleep and half dehydrated from the lack of a moist story, I noticed one thing about this movie that I think most people have, it doesnt make any sense.  Of course no one around me knew what was going on, because they were all wrapped up in their sleeping bags, sleeping nice and cozy. I figured I'd keep my eyes open a little bit longer to see if it was at least funny...nope.  This story is so unrealisitic, I'd swear hollywood thinks I'm an inbred with a pitch fork stuck up my a**. Because with the pain of pitchfork in the right place, this movie would be so so so much more bearable to watch.  In the movies defense I say it doesnt have a story because its a comedy...ha!  I laughed once during the entire movie, and it was when my girlfriends friend got her own gum stuck in her hair...ha!
Anyways, I suppose there are a few scenes that are funny, and maybe I expect too much when I go to the theaters...but all I know is purchasing this wretched piece of material is more expesive than a show, so if you need to rent it first...",986256000,2,2007,4.312997347480106

1318577,5,B00003CXTO,"I bust a gut every time I watch this.  Both Jones and Griffin are in top form.  The plot is full of twists and turns and the humor is non-stop.  For less than $5 you can't buy this much fun for 10 times the cost anywhere else.  You must see this and line up the kids too for it is just rated PG-13 and from my recollection, they just had enough adult situations and some mild language to get that rating.  Pop the popcorn, make some sweet tea and spend a few hours laughing, it's the best medicine.",1491264000,,498,4.040816326530612

It is about a sophisticated, wall-street type African-American man trying to make it to Mexico because someone is trying to frame him for murder; or at least it seems that way. Eddie Griffith appears to be a thorn in his side, but the movie has many twists and turns to it. Just when you think its one thing, it takes a turn and is actually something totally different. What I like the most is that this is not one of those movies that just has funny ""parts"" to it. The entire movie is hilarious all the way through.",1371859200,,574,4.275229357798165

1319285,2,B00003CXTO,"...`Double Take' has not aged very well for me.  I remember seeing this in the theaters and liking it.  It made me laugh and it had action and I was like sixteen and that was all that mattered at the moment.  After the dust cleared and my mind aged I revisited this film to find that it was nothing like I had remembered.  The laughs didn't come as readily as I had hoped and the plot was such a mess I was stumped as to how I enjoyed this at all when I had first seen it.  Then I remembered.  There are some films that knowledgably toss a recognizable and likable name in your face in order to blind you to the ridiculousness of everything going on.  In 2001, those names were Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffin.  For what it's worth, both actors are charismatic as all get out and they feed off each other rather well here.  They have their usual shtick, and it works for them, but when you cast aside their inherent likeability, the film just falls apart.  The action sequences seem out of place and the plot development is vacant.  Really, the only selling point here is the two lead actors.  I am not saying that all `buddy/action' flicks need to make sense.  I am a fan of films like `The Fast and The Furious' and even `Rush Hour', but that is because the films have more focused delivery that allocates for the implausibility of their plots.  They don't make sense but the films are still focused and deceptively cohesive.  `Double Take' doesn't understand that necessity.  It just continually lathers on the crazy without taking the time to polish it, to properly execute it.  This could have worked, but sadly it doesn't.",1299715200,,1628,4.445945945945946

1319478,1,B00003CXTO,"Most movies in the ""comedy"" genre usually have simple plots, humorous story lines, scripts, etc. ""Double Take"" had none of these. At no point through the entire movie was I even remotely amused by anything I saw or heard on my TV screen. I started questioning how a movie that so severly lacked the essence of comedy even made it to the theaters. And what was up with the plot? I don't want to be suprised when I rent a comedy, I want to laugh. I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rush Hour"" or ""Blue Streak"", but instead I get ""Mission Impossible"". Horrible comedy.",1009152000,2,576,4.443396226415095
1319479,3,B00003CXTO,"Double Take.  Can we say predictable? No.  Can we say hard to understand?  Yes.  For almost the entire movie, I had a hard time grasping what the heck was going on.  There were about a billion plot holes that were never filled, and a lot of pointless, unexplained happenings.  This was yet another one of those movies that you had to use your psychic abilities to figure out just what was happening.
But, on the other hand, Double Take was hilarious.  At first, Eddie Griffin was incredibly annoying, but he grows on you and becomes very funny.
Also, the ending was superb.  It turned out to be a mystery as to who were really the bad and good guys.
Double Take is a movie I wouldn't rank as the one of the smartest and well thought out movies ever, but if you want to laugh a lot, then rent it.  Take a chance on this one.  3 Stars",1006387200,,832,4.208860759493671

1319549,3,B00003CXTO,"Pretty funny but everything in this comedy of errors seems like its all been done before. Orlando Jones is a wealthy Wall Street businessman who gets caught up in a murder set-up and has no idea how to prove his innocence. Eddie Griffin is the incoherent bumbling idiot who keeps getting in his way of clearing his name.or is he? Lots of twists and turns, most of them predictable, but all of them enjoyable and the two leads do very well. Remake of Ken Annakin's Across The Bridge.",1001635200,,482,4.488636363636363
1319550,3,B00003CXTO,"Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't bad it just isn't that good either.  It keeps you guessing but in the end when you find out who's side who is on, it doesn't make sense.  If you think back to different scenes in the movie, I know they want to keep you guessing, but some of the incounters don't seem to fit when you see who is playing on what team in the end.  Funny and pretty entertaining but too messed up to keep you from leaving the fantasy world of entertainment.",1001030400,,473,4.119565217391305
1319551,1,B00003CXTO,"I welcomed this movie with an open mind and I was ready to have a great time. However, I knew soon enough that it was just going to be another RUSH HOUR wanna be. A very bad imitation, I might add !The plot was ""rocambolesque"" to say the least and Orlando Jones and Eddie Grifin had no chemistery what so ever. Further more, Eddie Griffin is NEITHER Chris Tucker nor Martin Lawrence, therefore he cannot carry a movie by himself. He better stick to supporting roles until he finds the right script. Skip this one and wait for RUSH HOUR 2.",997228800,,538,4.336633663366337

1319553,2,B00003CXTO,"While I appreciated the acting of Orlando Jones and the comedy of Eddie Griffin, this movie was horrible.
First of all, the jokes this movie features were limited to the jokes in the theatrical trailer.
The acting was okay, but far from realistic.
And the straw that broke the camel's back?  Twists, turns, suprises.  None of which I cared about! Until the last 10 minutes of the movie we are led to believe Freddy Tiffany is an FBI agent, a nutcase, an FBI agent, etc.  Stuff like this annoys me terribly.  If a movie can't decide who a key character is until the last scene, and its not directed by M. Night Shamalayan- forget it.  Also, the bad guys were good guys, the good guys were bad guys, and then it all happened because of a dog?  Who wrote this junk?  The comedy was overrated, the acting was borderline, the story was indecisive about where it wanted to go, and I felt myself looking at my watch constantly (this is sad because I watched this movie at home, and it's only 90 minutes long).
In short, stay away from this ""action-comedy"".  Rent Bait instead.  At least Jamie Foxx has personality.",996710400,2,1107,4.495
1319554,1,B00003CXTO,"Until earlier this week, I would have thought that ""Deep Impact"" was the most God-awful movie I had ever seen.  However, it has been surpassed!  I sat down and was expecting to be entertained and it turns out that the part of the movie that I thought was the dumbest is the only part I and a friend have been quoting!!  This movie started out way to fast and the fishiness of some characters was sensed way too early for my tastes.  Most movies don't raise suspicion about its characters until at least 30-45 minutes into the movie.  This bad boy started in the first five minutes.  What was that???  To make matters worst the twists that happened weren't all that ""life shattering"" for a movie.  The movie starts fast and then BAM, comes to a stupid little halt that I personally fell asleep through and we had to finish watching it later the next day!  Usually I fight sleep during a movie but with this one I welcomed it on!  As for the performances of Jones and Griffin, Jone's 7-Up commercials are so much better and Griffin should stick to stand-up comedy.  I've seen him live; it was so much better than this big screen performance.  It reminded me of Jim Carrey's performance in ""Ace Ventura 2"", too much of the actor's schtick bled into the character they were portraying!  Give us room to breathe!  I recommend NOT purchasing this film and only watching it if you didn't pay to rent it yourself so you won't be so p-o'd about the money you wasted.",996710400,,1457,4.449056603773585
1319555,3,B00003CXTO,"This film actually impressed me with its story.  From reading the customer reviews I can understand how some viewers could be eluded by the plot.  Typical viewers of this type film don't expect  to be challenged by sophisticated plot twists and multiple ""double takes"".  I was also impressed by the actors.  Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffen are funny and work well together.  Not to mention that they are fresh faced and relatively new to the silver screen.
The DVD offers extra features including a Director's Diary.  Director George Gallo gives a day by day review of the production of this film which began shooting in April 2000.  Complete with behind the scenes video footage.",996192000,,680,4.9035087719298245
