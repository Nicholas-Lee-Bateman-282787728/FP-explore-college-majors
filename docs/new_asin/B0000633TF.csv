1687195,3,B0000633TF,"A group of role-playing game enthusiasts gather every saturday night in their teacher's basement for swords, sorcery, and beers. One guy (played by Michael Wayne Walton) is a little bit TOO into the game, fantasizing about his knightly role with a girl gamer, who wants nothing to do with him. The bozo winds up driving into a tree and burning up, moments after swearing an oath to the great knight-of-the-rose pantheon. Soon, other saturday night gamers start turning up dead, cut to pieces by a dark knight on a big horse. Police are baffled, but we're not! I liked most of this movie. Not bad for a micro-budget indie...",1087257600,2,623,4.724770642201835

I like that to...anyway...there are some cool characters in this story but I really dug the burnout guy Zac! ""We are the burnouts proud and true, we grow our own [stuff] and smoke it too. I know one day that we'll all die but when we go we'll all go HIGH"" 10 STARS! These guys were smoking buds and making some low budget horror art! As for the others who didn't get the film, watch it again. Watch it while giving the burnout pledge of alligence. That is soo catchy that me and my buds require that of our comrades. Dude, Zac for president plus he has cool friends and a hot girlfriend. I bet the other dudes slamming this flick has neither the friends or the chicks. Later!",1053388800,,783,4.297297297297297

If you like movies that have to do with games,horses,and live games/games that come alive you need to see this one. The people in this movie/made this movie are verry smart to be able to think of a movie that people would like to see. Most of the movies out their are just stupid they say they are the movie that you need to watch. But this one you relly should see. It has good graphicks alot of peoples work and time went into this movie. I know some of the people that played in this movie and they are verry nice people that would relly apprceate it if you would take the time to sit down and watch this movie.  thank you for your time and please  watch this movie sincerly autum.. ps sorry for the bad spelling!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1024444800,3,824,4.14375
1687198,5,B0000633TF,"After viewing Jeffrey Kennedy's Knight Chills at the East Lansing Film Festival last spring, the images resonated in my memory for days. It was one of those films that let you continue reliving the intense moments and contemplating the motives of the characters long after you've walked out of the theatre.
This is the dark tale of a group of young adults and their former teacher who are members of a roleplaying game club. One embittered young man takes the game a bit too seriously, and seeks revenge upon his fellow role-players in a most bizarre and brutal way.
The writing is intelligent, the performances are powerful.  The action scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat.  At the same time, the nuances and subtleties of the characters' relationships to one another will intrigue you and keep you guessing.
You don't have to know a thing about role-playing to enjoy this film, which speaks to the brilliant dialogue.  Those who are familiar with role-playing games will feel that they are right there at the game table with the characters.  This is some of the most cleverly choreographed dialogue (the writing and filming) I have seen since the dinner table scene in Hannah and Her Sisters.
Purchasing this film is a wise investment, as you will want to view it again and again.",1014940800,5,1292,4.754464285714286
1687220,1,B0000633TF,"I cant believe that amazon would even carry this.  It looks like it was filmed with a cell phone.  The cast is awful, the effects are stupid.  They shoulda thrown in some skin shots and that woulda made up for it.",1296000000,5,213,4.146341463414634
1687221,4,B0000633TF,"What more can I say about this groundbreaking film, that hasn't already been said on these pages? Absolutely brilliant writing, directing, acting, effects for ""the rest of us"" that could care less about CGI, big name actors and the status quo. I have seen very little over the past few years that comes anywhere near the entertainment value and visceral punch of BIMBOS, B.C.!

For those of you out there like me (twisted?), there are a scant few independent films I've come across that provide similar entertainment. Off the top of my head are a couple of titles that come close to Bimbo's irreverence and inventiveness; I've linked 'em below should any of you wanna check 'em out:

There so bad that they burn a movie on each side so not to waste one whole Disk. By acting in theses movies they ended there career. I think the only uses for ""till death do us part"" is a form of cruel and unusual punishment. I mean for the love of god were the makers High?...or just low on film so they coulld not take ""re-takes""? If you see this movie on sale even for a god damn penny DONT by it!

1687225,4,B0000633TF,"These movies stink, but we knew that before ordering.  We bought the collection because Ron Jeremy, Robert Z'dar, and Conrad Brooks are in here.  There's one movie on here that makes up for how much the rest of these stink, though.  'Vampire Whores from Outer Space' is not at all serious, and it's pretty entertaining for a no budget horror movie a bunch of friends made in their spare time.",1240012800,9,392,4.571428571428571

Kind of ho-hum in that there is no nudity (that's actually okay given the cast), the violence is on par with a made-for-TV movie, and the plot is pretty predictable.

BUT THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING GOING FOR IT! ITS A REDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME! ITS ANNOYING! THE STORY & THE ACTORS JUST  DIDN'T PULL OFF WHAT IT SEEMED THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PULL OFF!WHAT EVER THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN!

1687229,1,B0000633TF,"An ""artsy"" attempt at horror that falls flat on its face.  Acting and direction are amatuerish, and the movie's score overrides so much of the dialogue, you want to scream.  It has a very slow and ill-acted opening, and it takes forever to get to any meaty substance.  Role playing games come across even more banal than I had thought.

7958400,5,B0000633TF,"Do you know those purchases you make drunk and then realise you made them once you see your credit history?
On a drunken movie night with some friends i purchased this gine film in the hopes of getting a few laughs and some other MST3000-esque banter out of it.
I have never greater regretted spending 3$ in my entire 27 years of life.
80% of the movie is spent in an elementary school (keep an eye out for the library scene that has a picture that says ""books are friends""), the other half in the woods behind the school.
This is the equivalent of an extended music video to ""Get down goblin.""
I watched, in abject horror as what i could only assume was my brain and corneas slowly dissolving from the lack of plot, the horroble acting, and the, what i can only assume, is a cannibal wizard.
Beyond that, great film, highly reccomend watching it",1468540800,,846,4.3949044585987265

7958402,1,B0000633TF,"OK you get 4 movies in this pack consisting of 2 double sided DVDs.  Some people complain about double sided DVDs but I take care of my discs and have a good disc polisher so not an issue with me.

The movies are 'Til Death Do Us Part (2002), Knight Chills (2001), Silo Killer (2002) and Night Train to Terror (1985).  First of all these are not even B movies so I wasn't expecting a Criterion release. None of the movies have subtitles (tough luck if your deaf).  the aspect ratios are as follows:
'Til Death Do Us Part (2002) Orig AR unknown. DVD 4:3
Knight Chills (2001) Orig AR unknown. DVD Non-anamorphic 1.85:1 (have to use zoom)
Silo Killer (2002)  Orig AR unknown. DVD Non-anamorphic 1.85:1 (have to use zoom)
Night Train to Terror (1985) Orig AR 1.85:1. DVD 4:3 (Fail!)

Night Train to Terror is 5 minutes shorter than the IMDB run time.

The transfers are average VHS rip quality, certainly not taken from negatives and would expect better for at least the 3 movies released in early 2001-2002 however given the $6000 budget IMDB gives for Silo Killer I suspect it at least may have been shot on VHS. Certainly when I see an non-anamorphic screen with greenish black bars on top and bottom I know this has come direct from a VHS rip.

All this lack of of extras and poor quality transfers would be excusable for a $5-8 movie set but the $17 price tag being charged is not good value so it gets 1 star. Look out for a second hand copy for $1-3.  There are plenty out there.",1417219200,,1482,4.36

7958405,2,B0000633TF,"So, I'm torn on my rating of this movie.  It really is bad, but I had fun laughing at how bad it was.  A previous reviewer commented about how it must have taken and an entire weekend to film, and cost their whole budget of 10's of dollars.  I'd say that's pretty accurate.  This is basically a homemade movie from the 80's.

But I did laugh while watching this movie... repeatedly.  So I can't give it 1 star.  Mind you, I didn't laugh because there was some clever dialog, or some good situational comedy, I laughed because just about everything in the movie was so horribly done that it was funny.",1362355200,,600,4.351351351351352
7958406,1,B0000633TF,"This is a truly bad film. I thought maybe this film would was striving to be bad in a funny way, but I now know that is was simply bad. Really bad. Worse than amateurish, this piece of trash should be avoided at all cost. If you have to pay even one cent for it, you will feel robbed. It is that bad. The 'costumes' look like they were created by a group of kindergartners who had raided their mothers' closets and found old fur coats and other such treasures. The writing was even worse, and the acting - and I use that word very loosely - made the writing look good. But the prize for horrible goes to the director who should have erased this travesty before it even got to the editing room. There is not a single redeeming quality in this film. Not even one. Even the sound was beyond terrible. DO NOT WATCH THIS WASTE OF ELECTRONS. You have been warned.",1358985600,,857,4.2

It was so bad I am making the effort to get my $2 back. Please post a preview of this movie so that your customers can see what they are renting. I am confident that there is no way to make a preview that would entice anyone to rent this awful ""production""

understand that your choice to rent this movie for $1.99 will make you sad and depressed, it will make you think about the people out in the world that would make this. please don't.

really.

7958408,3,B0000633TF,"This film starts off dramatically with this chunky cavewoman/girl getting attacked by this giant chicken /horse/ bird / rabbit thing.  Not sure what it was but it definitly had feathers.  Anyway, its dramatic!  sure you can pick and criticize but the high school art class or drama club that made this movie put their hearts and souls into it.  This movie clearly cost tens of dollars to make and I bet the movie took all weekend to film!

Most of the filming takes place in a high school and in some dudes back yard but that just adds to the realism.  Like the fact that you can see the actors' street clothes sticking out under their costumes or the fact that that all the cavewomen seem ...um....well fed shall we say.

As for the complaint that a movie with ""bimbos"" in the title should have some nudity, I doubt the high school would allow it. So if your looking for art, look no further.",1348704000,3,893,4.408536585365853
