8040811,5,B0006A1FMQ,"What we have is the presumptive full-length newsreel(s) of the 1932 tour of the British Isles, some sound footage from the '47 tour, and some silent scenes from probably between 1952 and 1954 (some fun with the Boys negotiating an exit from a taxi and then encountering a somewhat troublesome suitcase, backstage somewhere in Europe).
If you're a fan, or *collector*, the price is incredibly right.
Some of the material was used on the ""Biography"" edition on Stan Laurel. As a fan for over 40 years, some is completely new to me.
