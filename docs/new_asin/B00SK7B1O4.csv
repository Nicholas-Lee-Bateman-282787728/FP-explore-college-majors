6991147,5,B00SK7B1O4,"I am learning Italian and this was a fun supplement to my language classes. Excellent acting, good English subtitles that make it easy to follow yet still force you to listen closely to translate the language completely. Love this show. I have watched every episode of every set.",1436659200,,279,4.833333333333333
6991148,3,B00SK7B1O4,"When I bought us Set 9, I thought it meant Series 9.  It did not.  This DVD has shows from Seasons 4, 5, 6, and a few 7's.  Since we had seen nearly every Don Matteo on this disc we were disappointed.  If you are smarter than I am and could find the info with the details of what is on Set 9, you can see if you have seen those episodes or not.  We love Don Matteo but most of these episodes we have seen on TV multiple times.",1433548800,5,426,3.688888888888889

6991150,5,B00SK7B1O4,"I love the Don Matteo series.  I can't wait for more of them to come out on DVD.  The mysteries are good, and without all of the gore and violence of American TV.  The continuing subplots are fun, and there is always a touch of humor and humanity.  Not to mention the gorgeous setting of Gubbio.",1429488000,,295,4.214285714285714
6991151,5,B00SK7B1O4,Don Matteo seasons 9 and 10 were great. Can't wait to see seasons which will follow..Mr. Terence hill has been asked to another season of Don Matteo starting in March  2015. I know it will take a while for all the seasons to be shown in the U.S.A. but it will be worth the wait.,1428624000,,278,4.054545454545455
