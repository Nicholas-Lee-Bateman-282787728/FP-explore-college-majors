1246891,4,B00001WBQO,"""Sherlock Holmes Terror by Night"" is an enjoyable Holmes adventure providing a great opportunity to a Basil Rathbone performance.  For those of us hooked on Jeremy Britt's characterization of Sherlock Holmes, Rathbone's performance seems a bit uninspired.  Still, Sherlock Holmes the great detective is on the job, Dr Watson is there to help in his bumbling way, and the crime is so

1246902,4,B00001WBQO,"""Terror by Night"" (1946; 60 minutes) is the 13th, and next-to-last, entry in the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce series of Sherlock Holmes films produced between 1939 and 1946. This one isn't my favorite in the series, but a good one nevertheless. Even the poorest ones in the series are hoisted up immeasurably just by the presence of the two leads: Basil Rathbone (as the master detective himself) and Nigel Bruce (as Dr. John H. Watson).

""Terror"" takes place entirely aboard a train, with murder and mystery along for the ride!  Out of the fourteen films made in this excellent series of Holmes Classics, I would rank this one as my 6th favorite. The ones I deem even more entertaining would be .....

#1.)  The Hound of the Baskervilles [the first title with Rathbone as Sherlock; 1939];
#2.)  The House of Fear;
#3.)  Sherlock Holmes Faces Death;
#4.)  The Scarlet Claw;
#5.)  The Woman In Green.

All of these films generate a vivid atmosphere of mystery and suspense, and are all worth a look.",1006819200,,996,4.744186046511628

The film shows an expensive diamond ""The Star of Rhodesia"". All who possessed it came to a sudden and violent death. A new coffin will be used to send a body to Scotland. They show scenes of Euston Station in London. Sherlock Holmes studies the faces of passengers. Lady Margaret Carstairs will travel to Scotland with her valuable jewel. Can it be safe from thieves? Watson is late for the train. Holmes inspects this 423-carat diamond. [Did you see anything?] Roland Carstairs does not join his mother in the dining car. The ""Star of Rhodesia"" is gone! We see the other passengers in the carriage. One of them must be the murderer. Dr. Watson asks some questions. [Comic relief.] A tempest in a teapot? Someone attacks Holmes in the dark! Later he and Dr. Watson check the baggage compartment and learn a secret.

They question the young lady to learn about her actions. They find the baggage guard on the floor. We learn who are the guilty villains. Will there be more treachery? Can the murderer escape at the border stop? The Scottish police take charge to question the passengers. Inspector McDonald recognizes Colonel Moran, he is arrested after a struggle and taken off the train. But Sherlock Holmes isn't fooled at all! [Did you suspect this?] The gang is caught in spite of their clever plans. Sherlock Holmes explains it all.

Since Professor Moriarity was killed, and Colonel Moran was arrested for murder, what will Sherlock Holmes do next?",1486944000,,1482,4.803921568627451
