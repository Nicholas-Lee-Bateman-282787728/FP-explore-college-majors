8534826,5,B00018WENC,this series thru me for a loop you do need to appreciate the game to understand the anime and also get past the fact that the story goes in a backwards way either way it is a fighting game story done with anime so appreciate it for what it is none the less i enjoyed and do not regret my purchase,1152057600,3,296,3.8688524590163933
8534827,5,B00018WENC,"JoJo's bizarre adventure is one of the best animes I have seen in a long time! Overall... lots of action and a very very cool story line. I am always checking to see when the next episodes will be released... it is THAT good! I actually saw the entire series before but, in Japanese.
I am very dissapointed that the company that is translating it takes several months to release the next installment... otherwise you can't go wrong!! The DVDs have both English and Japanese for those that are hardcore but, it really isn't necessary because the English version stays pretty much true to the original (which of course is rare). I would not recommend this series for younger audiences. It is pretty violent and has is quite a bit of vulgarity.",1077062400,3,741,4.621212121212121
