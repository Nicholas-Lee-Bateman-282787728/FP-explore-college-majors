3423763,4,B00197POYK,"Produced as a school assignment at the University of Kansas, this documentary does an exemplary job of being entirely neutral about a group that causes strong passions.

Westboro Baptist Church and Fred Phelps, under the protection of the First Amendment, travel the country to celebrate the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq, the 9/11 murders, the deaths of Tsunami victims, and various other horrors. They believe that they are justified in this by America 'turning its back on God' by allowing homosexuality.

The documentary has interviews not only with Phelps, but also interviews with the young children who are on the picket lines with the rest of the family. Other interviews are with a cross section of society, including other ministers, the widow of a dead U.S. soldier whose funeral was picketed by the church, students at KU, some of Phelps' children that had broken with the family because if its extremism, and counter protesters. One of the most interesting is a brief shot of foreign tourists commenting about the protest that they had witnessed; they were courteous, yet seemed hilarious and horrified at the same time, as if they had been given a dead rat to eat, and weren't sure if it was a joke of unbelievably bad taste, or if it was serious.

My only criticisms are first, that Phelps' disbarment as an attorney was mentioned, but the circumstances were not explored in any great depth. Second, an expert in scripture was interviewed regarding Phelps' use of verse justifying his actions, but I found myself wishing for more. Third, Phelps had acted as a Civil Rights attorney, and actually received an award from the NAACP, and I thought that including that might be appropriate.

The interview with the director on the bonus section of the DVD, who is as previously mentioned, a then-student at University of Kansas, is almost the best part of the package. It is terrifically interesting to try to reconcile this professional, polished production with someone so young and relatively inexperienced. I very much look forward to what he will accomplish in the future.

I have attempted to be as fair and unbiased during the review as Mr. Jones was during his documentary. I feel it was incumbent upon me to be impartial and....

....oh, the hell with it. Phelps and his congregation are chimps, screaming and flinging their feces at other people. They make one ashamed of the human race. What they are teaching to their children to me qualifies as child molestation. As a proud veteran, seeing them protesting at a military funeral and dragging the American flag in the dirt appalls me.

But in a perverse way, the only positive is that this country's greatness is framed by the fact that these bizarre people are protected by the same Bill of Rights that covers us all. Phelps' whoring of the protections afforded by our system of laws simply makes those protections stand out in sharper relief.

Intead , it's just necessary to put Westboro Baptist Church in its proper context; they are aberrations, freaks, and probably not dangerous. Instead of greeting their spewing, smug, sanctimonious hatred with anger, it is MUCH more effective to laugh at them, and then dismiss them as irrelevant.",1222128000,16,3219,4.937153419593345

8272268,4,B00197POYK,"If you have ever visited ""youtube"" and did a search on the ""Westboro Baptist Church"" you're quite aware of the amount of information available on this controversial topic. ""Fall From Grace"" holds up well in depicting the group in a neutral way, letting them and the situations that arise involving their perspective (or God's perspective as they would prefer) speak for themselves.

The interesting thing about this group is they are very intelligent and adept in the judicial system. Which posed a hypothetical scenario in my mind that frustrates me to no end. I'll introduce it shortly.

Given that our country and constitution are based on many basic freedoms, common knowledge tells us we  have rights to believe in what ever form of religion or spirituality we choose personally. Freedom of speech is the second basic rule of thumb in this case. This said, it is important to know that this group could care less whether you believe or follow in their footsteps, they are just attempting to point out what they consider the true word of God is.

At the core of this belief (or God's intended meaning in the bible, as WBC states) is the fundamental truth that homosexuality is totally wrong on any level and that all major catastrophic events are God's punishment on mankind for allowing it to continue in any form or fashion.

What seems to upset the majority of folks who abhore WBC is the ""in your face"" aggressive way they operate and still manage to stay in the boundries of the law. Their picketing has provoked several lawsuits but any verdicts against them seem to be ultimately overturned.

All this being said, you personally may agree or disagree with this philosophy and, again, WBC states this is not their philosophy but the actual truth as God intended.

In many ways looking on as a neutral observer is hard to do with a subject such as this but when the signs are lowered and WBC sits down and explains certain cause and effects there is a validity to their arguments that can be debated but not easily ignored. One being their strong feelings against the Catholic church in light of the many allegations and lawsuits concerning child molestation among priests.

Now... our hypothetical scenario:

Lets say an individual has decided that what WBC has been saying is God's true voice and meaning. He chooses to follow this path. Then one day this individual has a divine intervention with, what he feels, is the voice or visitation from the true God or one of ""His"" spiritual minions. This inner voice has told this individual that he personally must kill another specific human being, whether it be a prominent statesman/woman or just the guy or gal down the street it is God's will and just the way destiny has been decided. This otherwise peaceful law abiding citizen decides to execute his chosen target and now sits in a jail cell. Because of his belief the world in which he or she lives is now a small room for the rest of his life or death row and his earthly judges consider him a ""lone nut"" case like so many criminals we see today.

One can see how choosing to believe this way creates a dangerous dilemma and I would be interested how WBC would respond both as attorneys and followers of the word of God. I'm sure the answer would embrace both but would they defend such an individual's actions? Would they represent him in court?

In a way such a scenario could be considered the ""Dead Zone Defense"". In Stephen King's novel ""The Dead Zone"" a man suffers an accident that gives him the power to see future events by touching another person. He stalks and kills a political candidate after shaking hands with him and it's revealed that this political hopeful would eventually bring about the end of the world in a nuclear scenario. The reader is thoroughly sympathetic to the act by the end of the story and thus, we are left with difficult questions of morality and behavior. It's one of King's best works.

These are deep thoughts but once you see ""Fall From Grace"" and other materials relating to WBC questions like this might plague you.

Even with the death of of WBC patriarch Fred Phelps this year the group still seems intent to carry on business as usual.

Whether you love, hate, or remain undecided about them above all else never forget (as WBC knows all too well) good or bad... it's all publicity.",1414540800,,4343,4.667539267015707
8272269,3,B00197POYK,"This is the unvarnished story of Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas. Phelps and his family are interviewed, officials of Topeka, people who have been picketed by them, a lawyer who has taken them to court, European tourists who said they had heard of American crazies, but couldn't believe what they saw. There are also interviews with the Phelps children, and it's heartbreaking to hear them talk so hatefully when they clearly do not understand what they are saying.

There are many, many views of the pickets and their brightly colored signs. You get so you don't really read them or see them anymore; the colors identify them as ""those nuts"" and you turn your head, or maybe you confront them. And if you do, you hear the most twisted rhetoric, the most distorted interpretations of Bible passages, the most coarse and hateful language you are ever likely to hear in pubic.

One event I really appreciated was the funeral of a young soldier who had been a motorcycle rider before he went into the Army and was sent to Iraq. The local bikers came to the funeral and set up a line in front of the Westboro pickets, and when they started shouting their filth, the bikers turned their tailpipes toward them and revved their engines. Most of the bikes were Harleys, and it was quite an effective drowning out of the shouting.

The real irony of the whole situation was summed up by a Topeka minister of the more Christian type of church, who said that Phelps is a classic example of a person who needs love most, and is least worthy of it. The movie then closes with a quiet, almost whispered singing of ""They Will Know We Are Christians by Our Love.""

And we will know Westboro by its hate.",1336694400,,1717,4.564935064935065

8272272,3,B00197POYK,"""Fall from Grace"" is a 70-minute documentary about the infamous Westboro Baptist Church. The church was also depicted by Louis Theroux in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Hated-Family-in-America/dp/B0036BN0DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Hated Family in America</a>"". Theroux succeeded in getting close to the family in a way that ""Fall from Grace"" doesn't. What ""Fall from Grace"" does that Theroux failed to do is interview some of the Phelps children who's left the church. This offers a new perspective on the church although the interviews were brief and done over the phone. ""Fall from Grace"" also includes interviews with some people of the Topeka community, including the mayor, police chief and a lawyer. On the whole, though, Fall from Grace is less successful and feels more shallow than Theroux's film and having seen that one, this didn't offer much new info, apart from the interviews with the children who left (most of which I already knew after reading Nate Phelps story online).",1270512000,,1049,5.730769230769231
8272273,4,B00197POYK,"Fall from Grace is the story of the Reverend Fred Phelps and his family. Phelps was once a successful Civil Rights attorney who won an award from the NAACP for representing minority clients. Since being disbarred for unethical behavior, Phelps has concentrated his energies on running the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas.

Never mind that the only members of the church are Phelps' own family, the Phelps clan is large enough and vocal enough to make up for its lack of outside members. The Phelpses have protested at the funerals of U.S. soldiers who have been killed in action; they have also baited everyone who offends them by trampling the American Flag and by displaying signs with slogans such as ""God Hates Fags"" emblazoned on them.

Fall from Grace easily holds the viewer's interest throughout its 70+ minutes. While the Phelps clan is certainly vile, they know a thing or two about getting attention. (They've participated in over 20,000 protests). Some of their protests are akin to performance art. The interviews with the Phelps family are amazing; there is a younger generation of Phelpses who are prepared to take over from Fred. The interviews with Phelps' estranged children help give the viewer some idea of what the man is like in private.

There are a few missed opportunities in Fall from Grace. I don't think that the filmmaker did enough to explore Phelps' past. I was surprised to learn that he had been an attorney and that he had done some admirable work. Some of Phelps' children are also attorneys. Also, the film is a ""just the facts"" presentation. The viewer wants to know why Phelps chooses to promote this bizarre, bitter philosophy, but answers (or even conjectures) are missing.

I strongly recommend Fall from Grace. It will amaze and terrify the viewer.",1259539200,2,1800,4.911184210526316
8272274,5,B00197POYK,"Ryan Jones was a senior at the University of Kansas when he did this film as a class project. It was, as I remember it, a semester-long project, but ended up being closer to a year by the time he completed it. The title is well named and could be taken to mean the subject's (Rev. Fred Phelps) Fall from Grace or a gay person's Fall From Grace as seen by the subject.

I tend toward the Reverand Phelps own Fall From Grace. We see a man so filled with hatred of his fellow man that he must certainly be out of grace with his God. Phelps and his large family live in Topeka, Kansas where he is pastor of the Westboro Baptist Church and the only members of the congregation are his immediate family.

The film follows the demonstrations which suggest that 9/11, the war in Iraq and the soldiers who have died in Iraq are God's way of punishing a society which tolerates a gay way of life. It's hell, fire and brimstone as you watch and listen to Phelp's sermons. Yet, it appears they are the rants of a person so filled with rage that he cannot be taken seriously.

There is a brief interview with Rev. Phelps, a disbarred attorney, which give the viewer some insight into his nature. Four of his children no longer associate themselves with the family and two, heard through telephone interviews, tell of the physical abuse they suffered at the hands of father Fred.

Most of the remaining children of Phelps are themselves attorneys and are very careful to protect their message so as to not step outside the limits of the First Amendment. Just a few weeks ago an article appeared in the Kansas City Star telling of an appeals court in Richmond, Virginia overturning a judges award for $5 million in damages for inflammatory messages carried by the Phelp's family at the funeral of a U.S. Marine killed in Iraq.

Gay lifestyle, a thought provoking and sensitive subject is well handled by Mr. Jones and is treated with maturity and intelligence. Ryan Jones should have a long and fruitful filmmaking career ahead of him.

8272275,4,B00197POYK,"Born in 1929, Fred Phelps attended Bob Jones University, the Prairie Bible Institute, and John Muir College and subsequently earned a law degree from Washburn University in 1962 and opened his own law firm in Topeka, Kansas in 1964.  Three years later Phelps incorporated Westboro Baptist Church in the same city and established himself as its pastor.  As the 1960s progressed he became well known as a civil rights attorney, frequently bringing suit on behalf of minorities; indeed, he became so well known in this field that he ultimately received an award for his work from the NAACP.  But something was going astray, and it became increasingly obvious as the 1960s drifted into the 1970s.

In 1977 Phelps filed a seemingly spurious lawsuit against court reporter Carolene Brady, and by most accounts his treatment of Brady while she was on the witness stand was utterly appalling.  When Phelps lost the case he appealed, but on this occasion he completely over-reached himself: he prepared a number of affidavits that Brady was able to demonstrate were fraudlent, and in 1979 Phelps was disbarred from the practice of Kansas law.  He continued to practice before the federal court, however, until no fewer than nine federal judges began to find him as disasteful as the Kansas bar association had and in 1985 filed formal complaint against him.  The complaint was settled in 1989 when Phelps agreed to cease practice of the law before the federal court as well.

Now focused entirely upon his church, which consisted almost exclusively of his own large family, Phelps found a new venue: homosexuality.  Various accounts have been given of how Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church came to focus on this subject, but most seem to stem from a Phelps family member's allegation of homosexual activity in a public park near the church.  Whatever the case, Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church began to picket and protest against homosexuals, and in 1998 they attained the national spotlight when they picketed and protested in Laramie, Wyoming following the murder of Matthew Shepard.  Since that time they have never looked back.  It is difficult to know how factual the statement is, but in 2009 they claimed to have staged 41,000 protests in 650 cities since 1991.

Although Phelps and Westboro typically focus on homosexuality, they also picket and protest anything and any one they can even remotely construe as connected with homosexuality.  Condemned people range from Diana, Princess of Wales to Rev. Billy Graham; condemned religious institutions include The Roman Catholic Church, The Church of Latter Day Saints, and indeed virtually every Christian and non-Christian denomination; and entire nations, including the United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, and a host of others.  A number of respected organizations have defined Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group, and both Phelps and the church are monitored by such groups as Southern Poverty Law Center, which track hate groups and hate crimes.

Released in 2007, FALL FROM GRACE includes one of the last interviews granted by Fred Phelps himself, who is now more commonly represented by son Timothy Phelps and daughter Shirley Phelps Roper.  The weakness in the documentary, which at 71 minutes has little time for such, is that it offers little background; although it does touch on Phelp's legal career and disbarment, and even more so on the accusations of child abuse leveled against him, there is little in the way of Phelp's personal history.  Even so, what has made it to the screen is utterly astonishing, and while the documentary contains interesting and frequently moving interviews with those who oppose Phelps, the most astonishing moments come from Phelps and his own family.  Although son Timothy seems to have a truly nasty disposition, both Phelps and daughter Shirley seem quite calm, perhaps even likeable--at least until you seriously listen to their comments and see them in actual action, at which point they suddenly seem more akin to demons from the pit than human beings, much less Christians.  Perhaps most shocking of all are interviews with the family's children, who respond with venom on a subject they are very clearly too young to know anything about.

It is particularly to director K. Ryan Jones' credit (and astonishingly, he began work on this documentary while still a college student) that he does not slant his own point of view into the proceedings.  He simply allows Phelps and his minions to behave as they normally do without making editorial comment, and the result is more powerful than a number of other documentaries that have included Phelps and family.  Words like ""evil"" may seem old fashioned, but they apply here, and FALL FROM GRACE allows it to show itself with maximum visibility.  A great many commentators have found reason to laugh at Phelps and to make fun of his followers, but this film puts across a truth that is far more uncomfortable: there is nothing funny about poison.  Nothing funny at all.  The DVD includes two bonuses, one an interview with director Jones, one a brief display of the way Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church received the film when it was released.

Powerful and recommended.
