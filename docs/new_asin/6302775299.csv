The DVD is available out there and runs 72 minutes. I have not viewed the DVD but I suspect that they cut out ""I Woke Up This Morning"" for the VHS format.",1116892800,4,290,3.85
7831174,5,6302775299,"Fifteen years after seeing Ten Years After live, the band still has it in this 1983 concert.  The videographer stays on the band most of the time (there can always be more video of Alvin's fingers) and the sound quality is very good to excellent.  Be sure to play it through a stereo at maximum volume.  This video is well worth the price and the time spent viewing it.  Rock on!",1034899200,7,379,4.295774647887324

7831176,4,6302775299,"If you are a Ten Years After fan, buy this tape. The recording is around the early to mid 80's.  The sound quality, except for about 20 seconds, is excellent and produced by Leo Lyons.  The play list is LOVE LIKE A MAN, I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'M NOT WRONG ALWAYS, GOOD MORNING LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL, HELP ME, WOODCHOPERS BALL, SLOW BULES IN 'C'AND I'M GOIN HOME. Runnig time is around 60 minutes.  The approach of the band is no frills and LOUD.  Alvin is better than ever.  The two songs from the 'UNDEAD'album are a real treat for the fans who followed the band from the very beginning (you know which ones they are). I played this tape for my 14 year old son.  He loved it! It's a good deal for the price.  Keep on Rocking!",997920000,4,720,4.136690647482014
