8128806,2,B000G2EKK8,"There was too much marching and clapping here.  It seemed like that was all we were doing for half the time.  She would teach a step, we would do it a few times and then march some more.  It would  have been more enjoyable, interesting and more of a workout to just do the actual steps more.  Some of the steps were difficult or confusing to learn, mostly because the camera would focus on the upper body of Suzanne so we couldn't see the whole step being done.  Also, I just don't think this is a hard enough workout.  If I'm going to take the time to exercise, I want it to be worth my while.  This doesn't do it for me.  I do like Suzanne's on screen personality and the music is good.  I've used Suzanne's The Fix and like it much better.",1187049600,2,742,4.090277777777778
8128807,1,B000G2EKK8,"The instructor is really spastic, and the camera focuses on her upper body so much that you can't hardly tell what she's doing that you can follow along.",1183852800,,153,4.5
8128808,5,B000G2EKK8,I also found this at Walmart for $1.00.  The previous reviewer did an excellent job describing the workout.  I wil ljust add that it is great fun and is appropriate for all workout levels.,1178668800,2,188,4.5
