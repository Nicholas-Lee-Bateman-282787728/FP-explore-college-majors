College Road Trip is a slap-stick comedy that is a great movie to take your kids to, as long as they are young.  The main criticism I have of this movie is about the marketing, since most kids that are college bound are probably too old for this.  The jokes are very predictable humor.  If your kids are older than 14, they will probably find this style of humor too childish for their tastes.  In that way this movie is a missed opportunity for Disney to expand their market to all the older Martin Lawrence and Raven fans.

If you've seen the trailers, you pretty much know the entire story.  Dad (Martin Lawrence) takes daughter (Raven) on a road trip to check out colleges.  Antics ensue.

Martin's character is a very over-protective police chief who is a bit of a control freak.  His daughter has long outgrown being daddy's little girl.  He wants her to stay local for college, but she wants to go away.

There's a genius younger brother and a pet pig to add the cute factor.  There must be a lot of young geniuses out there because little brothers never have normal intelligence in movies or TV anymore, but I digress.  Raven's friends are cliched teenaged valley girls who aren't even from the valley.

Most people who initially may be interested in seeing the movie are either Raven fans or Martin Lawrence fans.  Yet this movie was made for an audience of much younger kids.

I am a huge Martin Lawrence fan and I think Raven is very talented and funny. But both of them were under used in this movie.  Martin Lawrence is frequenty upstaged by his co-stars, and Raven does a good job but doesn't have the best lines.  In fact, Will Sasso, Donny Osmand, his daughter, and the pig are the highlights of this movie.  And they don't have enough scenes to make this movie really funny for adults.

Young kids from 5 to 12 or 13 will love the jokes.  College bound kids will find themselves wondering why they called this ""College Road Trip"" when it's clearly designed for kids that aren't even out of grade school.

Overall, this movie is somewhat disappointing.  It could have been so much more with the cast that they collected here.  If you've got a group of young kids and want to take them to a fun and wholesome Disney movie, this is it.  If you're kids are college bound, or even high school sophomores, they probably would rather see something else.

Enjoy!",1204848000,16,2563,4.845622119815668

3111422,5,B0013J30UE,"My daughter introduced me to this movie when she was in elementary school; I can not imagine that I would have ever watched it on my own. A secret pleasure, perhaps? This movie is laugh-out-loud hilarious. She used to check the DVD out from the library almost weekly, so I ordered the blu-ray for her. Great price, cheap. This is a great, clean, wholesome family movie. The huge revelation is Donny Osmond (I know, I know - but seriously). He is absolutely hilarious and steals every scene that he is in.

3111438,5,B0013J30UE,"College Road Trip is a 2008 Disney DVD starring Martin Lawrence(Martin, Black Knight), Raven(That's So Raven, The Cosby Show), Brenda Song(Wendy Wu, The Suite Life On Deck), and pop music icon Donny Osmond(Donny and Marie), In this film, James Porter(Lawrence) wants his daughter Melanie(Raven) to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill, so he can keep an eye on her, but she already made up her mind on Georgetown in Washington, DC. Disgruntled, James travels with Melanie to Georgetown, and along the way, the encounter many hilarious obstacles like a stowaway pig, angry golf players and a completely annoying happy father/daughter team(the dad is portrayed by Osmond). The special features includes a music video by Raven, as well as sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Wall-E. College Road Trip is one of Martin Lawrence's Disney films that he starred in and it is a refreshing break from the raunchy R-rated comedy he is famous for.

3111486,4,B0013J30UE,Martin a cop plays the role of an over protective dad causing some drama along the way. Everyone seems to be aware of the fact that he is a bit over protective except for him. He is so protective he had his daughters whole life planned out for her before she even came into adult hood and we all know how well that works. With special guest Donnie Osmond singer from the 70's who plays another over the edge dad it gives the right mixture of annoying yet funny in these desperate last years of child hood for the two daughters. Good movie over all.,1295740800,,548,4.228571428571429
3111487,2,B0013J30UE,"When it comes to movie themes, there is nothing new about road trips and father-daughter bonding.  We've witnessed it all from Chevy Chase's Vacation classic to the hilarious Little Miss Sunshine, where semi-dysfunctional families manage to conquer their destination.  Likewise we have also been treated to touching father and daughter scenes from both the original and remake of Father-of-the-Bride to the more conniving episodes of Ryan and Tatum O'Neil's Paper Moon.  Unlike these films and numerous others, College Road Trip falls short, as it offers nothing new in the line of plot or comedy.

It starts with a father tearfully giving away his daughter at her Cinderella wedding.  He and his daughter are secondary characters whom we meet up with later.  As the narrator quickly explains, a father doesn't lose his daughter when she gets married; he loses her when she first goes off to college.  Hence, the plot and our introduction to the main family:  an over-protective, policeman dad, a more liberal but peacemaking mom, their independent but well-rooted daughter Melanie, her brilliant child prodigy little brother, and a pig named Albert.

Since her birth, Dad planned for Melanie to go to Northwestern University, just a 45 minute ride from home, convenient enough for Dad to drop by.  Naturally Melanie has plans for Georgetown University, approximately 1,000 miles from home.  Realizing he can't shake the idea from his daughter's head, Dad quickly steps into the role of tour guide, and the trip begins, cop car and all.

It's no surprise that father and daughter are off to a rocky start.  The little brother and pig show up as stowaways, the police car is totaled in the woods, and a singing Donny Osmond with his perky on-screen daughter come to the rescue to give both the family and the movie a desperately needed lift.

Afterward Dad and Mel begin to bond and they catch up with the bride and father in the opening scene.  The pig, whose only purpose was to destroy this wedding, steals a few scenes until he and his master get dropped off at Grandma's so Dad and Sis can continue to make the trip on their own.  And the rest is just far too predictable to mention.

While secondary characters kept moving in and out of scenes, they weren't used efficiently enough to make the movie as well-rounded and funny as it could have been.  The boy and his pig had their own agenda which should have been developed rather than aborted.  The ruined wedding could have resulted in a revelation for the bride, and Donny's ditzy daughter could have been pregnant rather than engaged in the last seen.

But they stuck to the typical, family, slapstick humor that is irresistible to youngsters but mundane to adults.  That's not to say that it wasn't good for a few laughs, especially in Donny Osmond's scenes.  So if you are looking for a light weight comedy, by all means rent it, but if you are hoping for anything more, you might want to trade Albert the pig for Arnold the pig, and watch a Green Acres rerun instead.",1285632000,,3029,4.7846153846153845

They decide to take a road trip to Georgetown for her interview. Her young brother and his pet pig hitch a ride too, and they must overcome several mishaps to get to Georgetown in time for the interview. From skydiving to a pig on caffeine; it was just silly.

Dad wants to assure total security and safety for his precious daughter, while Melanie has a 17-year-old's need to become a grown woman and have her own sense of independence. It is a funny cool movie. It makes you laugh, and it has a good story line. This is a great family movie.",1262736000,,610,4.819047619047619
3111501,1,B0013J30UE,"Saying that I wanted this to be good is kind of stupid because, well, just look at it, but really, I expected it to at least be `three star' worthy.  I mean, it has Raven-Symone in it, and she is quite hilarious, even if her shtick is pure corn.  Besides, it also has Martin Lawrence, and while I never found him as engaging as everyone else, he has a knack for making me laugh.  So, it should be cutesy and forgettable, but above all else cute; right?

Eh, not really.

Melanie wants to go to Georgetown to study law and hopefully go to Tokyo, but her overprotective father James doesn't even want her to go to the supermarket, let alone another country.  When his plans to send her to Northwestern (a college only forty miles away from home) get squashed by a surprise Georgetown interview, James decides to accompany his daughter on her drive to the college, hoping to persuade her along the way to ditch her dreams and pursue his.  Instead, they fight and makeup then fight and makeup.  Add to obvious, a slew of scenes involving more obviousness and you have (obviously) a clich&eacute;d family film; but, where a lot of films layer predictability with chemistry, charm and humor, `College Road Trip' fails.

Raven is funny at times, but her approach to comedy, while delightful in half-hour doses, gets tiring after a while; and Lawrence, who seems to be trying to emulate De Niro's `well meaning jerk' from `Meet the Parents', is just awkward.  They don't really come together like they should (and Lawrence is NO De Niro).

The gags grow old really fast (the first time we saw the pig my wife said to me ""this is going to get old quick"" and she was right) and the `father/daughter bonding' element just feels like a regurgitated plot point with not fresh individuality.  In fact, a lot of the film comes across like a poor-mans version of highlights from OTHER films.  I actually thought that Donny Osmand was funny for a hot second and then, well, he wasn't anymore.  The whole thing just seemed really lazy and uninspired.  I have seen a lot of these teeny-bop brand family films, and some of them are quite entertaining and endearing and memorable.  `College Road Trip' is not one of those films.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the ridiculousness that was that slow motion `it's so sad to finally be going to college and have my daddy there happy for me' scene that comes at the end...roll my eyes retarded (it was like 5 minutes long!)

I'm not sure why so many seem to love this movie, but maybe the reviewers are really young (that's not meant as an insult, just an observation).  I can see that, since the humor here seems to be targeted at the 5-10 crowd, which baffles me since it was one of those movies that seemed to be thrust in the `tween' department.  I can't think of a single person over the age of 9 that is going to find this movie remotely funny.",1255305600,,2881,4.493282149712092

Yes this movie is very predictable, however this is wholesome and absolute clean comedy. Some may say this is not a teenage movie, but why can't it be. Is it because it isn't pertaining to sex, or doesn't have risque moments in it, or because they are using acceptable language? Does those norms have to present for a movie to be considered teenage. With thinking like that I see how society has branded our teens useless and to mature for their ages. I a have daughter, but unfortunately she's only 4. If she were older and in her mid-teens I would most definitely take her to see this. This is a great movie with great morals and understanding to the thinking of parents and children. I believe this should be in everyone's dvd collection not only because of the great acting, but because it is wholesome and purely pure. This is what we're missing in our society.......PURITY..........and honestly if more of our teens demonstrated purity and childish behavior than just maybe our pregnancy and drug and alcohol epidemic would decline. As a parent and as a 23 year old I wish that I had that interaction with my parents and I surely wish to have that purity in my household as I raise my daughter. Childhood is childhood. Children should be kept as children and although teenage signifies a different stage it should not dictate your childs way of thinking. This is a teenage movie, but unfortunately parents today don't know the place of what a true teenager is. A true teenager isn't watching rated r movies, a true teenage doesn't laugh only at sexual related jokes, and surely a true teenager is never to old to spend wholesome with the family. Honestly I cannot wait to purchase this on dvd.

Our 7 year old laughed through most of the movie - and loved the science minded younger brother with his pet pig.  My husband (a military pilot who leans toward being overprotective) enjoyed the movie immensely, as did I.

There are fun situations for everyone in the family; work relationships, silly things we do under the guise of protecting family, use/overuse of technology (GREAT GPS sequence!), poking fun at stereoypes of older family members, and sentimental songs of growing up (a fun version of Double Dutch Bus by Raven Symone).

To be honest I don't really see why any child under 13 would want to watch this movie, especially without their parents. It seems like this movie would be directed more to adults relating to this same problem of a child leaving the nest, or what this father thought was a problem, and of course the kids don't mind watching. Only because this movie was so, so, so, so, funny, I must have laughed atleast a dozen times, and I don't usually laugh that often while watching movies.

3111539,4,B0013J30UE,"Disney has always had a unique way of entertaining while teaching life lessons in their films, and College Road Trip is no exception to that rule!

Disney's College Road Trip tells the story of a battle for independence between a loving but protective father and his teenage daughter. Disney Channel favorite, Raven-Symone (TV's ""That's So Raven,"" ""Cheetah Girls""), stars as Melanie Porter, an overachieving high school student with her heart set on attending Washington D.C.'s Georgetown University. Martin Lawrence (Wild Hogs), turns in a great performance as the overbearing dad who wants her to stay closer to their Chicago home -- and will literally do whatever it takes to keep her there!

As the familiar Cinderella Castle is displayed and the film starts rolling, you know you are in for a great time! Martin Lawrence is at his best as the Dad who only wants the best for his daughter and Raven-Symone, and the rest of the cast (including Einstein the pig), keep everyone laughing from beginning to end.

However, even throughout the terrific comedic laughter, Disney has a deeper important message -- once in a while too much love can sometimes drown out what your children are really saying.

The film also hosts a variety of familiar actors and actresses from the Disney family including Donny Osmond, Brenda Song (Suite Life of Zack and Cody), and Lucas Grabeel (High School Musical).

The College Road Trip DVD presents the film in both full screen (1.33:1) and also widescreen amaphoric (2.35:1). The DVD itself is also full of extras including an alternative opening and ending scene, along with Raven's ""on the set video Diary"" and the music video of ""Double Dutch Bus"", performed by Raven-Symone.

College Road Trip is a great family film and hits close to home for parents having problems with letting their children grow up, which so many do because it is a very difficult task.",1218067200,,1897,4.949685534591195

This film is awful, how many ways are there to say it? It's a waste of time to watch, and a waste of time to review.

I love Martin Lawrence, Donny Osmond, Disney, and good G rated films, but this is just a bad movie.

I knew it was bad from the very start, when the mock-trial featured high school students with clown like wolf and pig noses rubber banded to their faces. It got worse from there.

I would have walked out after the first twenty minutes, but I forced myself to watch the whole movie so that I could see all of Donny's appearances. His performance is OK, more of the nerdy white guy schtick. There is about one funny joke in the entire movie, and Donny gets that at the very end. But nothing could be worth that wait. It's such a shame to see Donny's immense talent and charm absent from the screen for 30 years, only to surface in this wasteland. I'm glad to see him on the screen and his name in the credits, but I can't see how this is a good career move for him. Also, I wish he would be proud of his white style and awesome 1970s accomplishments, rather than trying to show that he's hip enough to recognize that he's nerdy. Trying to prove you're cool by showing that you recognize how uncool you are seems to be silly.

Why does Disney schlock out these supremely lame live action movies? With such masterful dramatic treatment of stories like Alice in Wonderland and The Little Mermaid, they have shown they know how to make a great story. It's sad.

The pig is a complete waste. If you are entertained by a pig walking on to the screen, then it might be ok. Except for one feature scene where he gets hopped up, that's all he does. The Einstein little brother is a complete waste. The wife is a complete waste. The crazy grandma is a complete waste. Basically I'm just compulsively typing to say that almost nothing works in this movie on any level.

There's one funny sequence where the GPS system takes them out to the wilderness. I've had that experience with GPS, many times.

Raven gives us one good performance of ""The Double Dutch Bus,"" and Donny gets one funny joke. Other than that, this film is horrible. For the last half hour I was fidgeting and internally screaming ""I can't take it anymore!"" Boy was I glad when it was over.",1206316800,6,2276,4.341176470588235
3111553,3,B0013J30UE,"There's a sequence in ""College Road Trip"" in which a pig destroys a wedding because it's hopped up on coffee beans. This is soon followed by Raven-Symon leading a busload of Asian tourists in a rendition of ""Double Dutch Bus."" Near the end of the film, Symon and Martin Lawrence become on-the-spot skydivers; they land in a golf course where they just happen to run into the man whose daughter's wedding was destroyed by the pig. I'd like to say that this material is expected of a G rated film, but is it really? It seems more likely that the filmmakers were just grabbing at comedic straws and hoping that something would come of it. I won't say that this movie is bad, because I'm well aware that it's aiming for younger audiences. But it definitely isn't trying very hard; the theme is transitioning into adulthood, but the sense of humor is the kind only young children can appreciate.

The plot: seventeen-year-old Melanie Porter (Symon) wants to attend Georgetown Universtiy in Washington D.C., but her insanely overprotective father, James (Lawrence), wants her to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Northwestern is only a forty-mile drive from their home just outside of Chicago, and as a police chief, he believes that such a short distance will keep his daughter safe. Besides, he had been planning this for her ever since she was born. He's clearly a control freak, which is partly why Melanie wants to go to a far-away college. But there's more to it than that: she wants to study law. Unbeknownst to James, a judge visiting her high school promised to arrange an interview for her at Georgetown. Also unbeknownst to James, Melanie and her friends had planned a road trip that would end up in Washington D.C. When he learns of all this, he decides to take Melanie on his own version of a road trip; hopefully, he can convince her that Northwestern is the best possible choice.

The comedic hijinx begin almost as soon as the trip. At the first stop--Northwestern--Melanie quickly discovers that her father staged an elaborate scheme; tour guides, students, and faculty all tell Melanie that Georgetown is a violent place. One person says that her father is smart and cool. After this fiasco, James' car gets a flat tire in the middle of the woods, and from this we discover that his brainy young son--Trey (Eshaya Draper)--has stowed away, along with his pet pig, Albert (who James doesn't trust; he calls him Houdini Pig). James jacks the car too far up, causing it to roll down a hill and into a ditch. They then stay at a hotel where the abovementioned wedding is being held. They then meet the father/daughter duo of Doug and Wendy Greenhut (Donny Osmond and Molly Ephraim), who are also on a college road trip. They happily drive James and Melanie to a bus station. Actually, ""happily"" is not a strong enough word here--they take perky to a level I don't care to describe.

Naturally, Melanie and James start reconnecting as the journey continues. But more importantly, James begins to realize that Melanie is no longer his precious little girl; he has to take the steps to let her go so that she can live her own life. Unoriginal, yes, but I think we all know that issues of love and trust play major roles in any such story. We even get the obligatory advice from Melanie's grandmother (Ametia Walker), required by the unspoken laws of family films to understand her granddaughter's frustration. None of that bothered me. What did bother me were scenes that took the comedy to unnecessary heights. Example: after sneaking into a sorority house to spy on Melanie, James is tasered by the sorority mother and arrested. Why did this scene have to be in the movie? Do you think young kids would find that funny? How many young kids actually know what a taser gun is? I suppose it may be more than I think, and that's sad when you stop and think about it.

Moments like that are genuinely bad. Everything else about the film is just mind-numbingly routine, offering nothing new in the way of character, theme, setting, or resolution. The best that can be said is that the actors look like they're having fun. This is especially true of Donny Osmond, who hams it up so thoroughly that it's more or less convincing. Raven-Symon seems to be in her element, but that isn't saying very much since her resume is largely composed of ""That's So Raven.""

I think by now you get the point I'm trying to make. Most films like this suffer because the filmmakers don't know how to handle the material; they make them too goofy or too sappy or too crazy, even when the story doesn't call for it. I didn't get that feeling from ""College Road Trip""--it seemed like the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing. That's fine, I guess, as long as you don't mind family films that are zany, sickly sweet, and predictable. I can pretty much guarantee that kids will enjoy this film, if not for its message, then for the delight of watching the adult characters do silly things. The pig will also get some laughs out of the little ones. Let's face it--the pig is damn cute. Parents, on the other hand, will get almost nothing from the film, save for a couple of tender moments between Lawrence and Symon. ""College Road Trip"" is only as good as it wanted to be, a fancy way of saying it didn't want to be very good at all.",1205193600,5,5337,4.643386243386243

College Road Trip is a slap-stick comedy that is a great movie to take your kids to, as long as they are young.  The main criticism I have of this movie is about the marketing, since most kids that are college bound are probably too old for this.  The jokes are very predictable humor.  If your kids are older than 14, they will probably find this style of humor too childish for their tastes.  In that way this movie is a missed opportunity for Disney to expand their market to all the older Martin Lawrence and Raven fans.

If you've seen the trailers, you pretty much know the entire story.  Dad (Martin Lawrence) takes daughter (Raven) on a road trip to check out colleges.  Antics ensue.

Martin's character is a very over-protective police chief who is a bit of a control freak.  His daughter has long outgrown being daddy's little girl.  He wants her to stay local for college, but she wants to go away.

There's a genius younger brother and a pet pig to add the cute factor.  There must be a lot of young geniuses out there because little brothers never have normal intelligence in movies or TV anymore, but I digress.  Raven's friends are cliched teenaged valley girls who aren't even from the valley.

Most people who initially may be interested in seeing the movie are either Raven fans or Martin Lawrence fans.  Yet this movie was made for an audience of much younger kids.

I am a huge Martin Lawrence fan and I think Raven is very talented and funny. But both of them were under used in this movie.  Martin Lawrence is frequenty upstaged by his co-stars, and Raven does a good job but doesn't have the best lines.  In fact, Will Sasso, Donny Osmand, his daughter, and the pig are the highlights of this movie.  And they don't have enough scenes to make this movie really funny for adults.

Young kids from 5 to 12 or 13 will love the jokes.  College bound kids will find themselves wondering why they called this ""College Road Trip"" when it's clearly designed for kids that aren't even out of grade school.

Overall, this movie is somewhat disappointing.  It could have been so much more with the cast that they collected here.  If you've got a group of young kids and want to take them to a fun and wholesome Disney movie, this is it.  If you're kids are college bound, or even high school sophomores, they probably would rather see something else.

Enjoy!",1204848000,16,2563,4.845622119815668

3345935,5,B0013J30UE,"College Road Trip is a 2008 Disney DVD starring Martin Lawrence(Martin, Black Knight), Raven(That's So Raven, The Cosby Show), Brenda Song(Wendy Wu, The Suite Life On Deck), and pop music icon Donny Osmond(Donny and Marie), In this film, James Porter(Lawrence) wants his daughter Melanie(Raven) to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill, so he can keep an eye on her, but she already made up her mind on Georgetown in Washington, DC. Disgruntled, James travels with Melanie to Georgetown, and along the way, the encounter many hilarious obstacles like a stowaway pig, angry golf players and a completely annoying happy father/daughter team(the dad is portrayed by Osmond). The special features includes a music video by Raven, as well as sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Wall-E.

3345984,2,B0013J30UE,"When it comes to movie themes, there is nothing new about road trips and father-daughter bonding.  We've witnessed it all from Chevy Chase's Vacation classic to the hilarious Little Miss Sunshine, where semi-dysfunctional families manage to conquer their destination.  Likewise we have also been treated to touching father and daughter scenes from both the original and remake of Father-of-the-Bride to the more conniving episodes of Ryan and Tatum O'Neil's Paper Moon.  Unlike these films and numerous others, College Road Trip falls short, as it offers nothing new in the line of plot or comedy.

It starts with a father tearfully giving away his daughter at her Cinderella wedding.  He and his daughter are secondary characters whom we meet up with later.  As the narrator quickly explains, a father doesn't lose his daughter when she gets married; he loses her when she first goes off to college.  Hence, the plot and our introduction to the main family:  an over-protective, policeman dad, a more liberal but peacemaking mom, their independent but well-rooted daughter Melanie, her brilliant child prodigy little brother, and a pig named Albert.

Since her birth, Dad planned for Melanie to go to Northwestern University, just a 45 minute ride from home, convenient enough for Dad to drop by.  Naturally Melanie has plans for Georgetown University, approximately 1,000 miles from home.  Realizing he can't shake the idea from his daughter's head, Dad quickly steps into the role of tour guide, and the trip begins, cop car and all.

It's no surprise that father and daughter are off to a rocky start.  The little brother and pig show up as stowaways, the police car is totaled in the woods, and a singing Donny Osmond with his perky on-screen daughter come to the rescue to give both the family and the movie a desperately needed lift.

Afterward Dad and Mel begin to bond and they catch up with the bride and father in the opening scene.  The pig, whose only purpose was to destroy this wedding, steals a few scenes until he and his master get dropped off at Grandma's so Dad and Sis can continue to make the trip on their own.  And the rest is just far too predictable to mention.

While secondary characters kept moving in and out of scenes, they weren't used efficiently enough to make the movie as well-rounded and funny as it could have been.  The boy and his pig had their own agenda which should have been developed rather than aborted.  The ruined wedding could have resulted in a revelation for the bride, and Donny's ditzy daughter could have been pregnant rather than engaged in the last seen.

But they stuck to the typical, family, slapstick humor that is irresistible to youngsters but mundane to adults.  That's not to say that it wasn't good for a few laughs, especially in Donny Osmond's scenes.  So if you are looking for a light weight comedy, by all means rent it, but if you are hoping for anything more, you might want to trade Albert the pig for Arnold the pig, and watch a Green Acres rerun instead.",1285632000,,3029,4.7846153846153845

It is a funny cool movie. It makes you laugh, and it has a good story line. This is a great family movie.",1262736000,,610,4.819047619047619
3345998,1,B0013J30UE,"Saying that I wanted this to be good is kind of stupid because, well, just look at it, but really, I expected it to at least be `three star' worthy.  I mean, it has Raven-Symone in it, and she is quite hilarious, even if her shtick is pure corn.  Besides, it also has Martin Lawrence, and while I never found him as engaging as everyone else, he has a knack for making me laugh.  So, it should be cutesy and forgettable, but above all else cute; right?

Eh, not really.

Melanie wants to go to Georgetown to study law and hopefully go to Tokyo, but her overprotective father James doesn't even want her to go to the supermarket, let alone another country.  When his plans to send her to Northwestern (a college only forty miles away from home) get squashed by a surprise Georgetown interview, James decides to accompany his daughter on her drive to the college, hoping to persuade her along the way to ditch her dreams and pursue his.  Instead, they fight and makeup then fight and makeup.  Add to obvious, a slew of scenes involving more obviousness and you have (obviously) a clich&eacute;d family film; but, where a lot of films layer predictability with chemistry, charm and humor, `College Road Trip' fails.

Raven is funny at times, but her approach to comedy, while delightful in half-hour doses, gets tiring after a while; and Lawrence, who seems to be trying to emulate De Niro's `well meaning jerk' from `Meet the Parents', is just awkward.  They don't really come together like they should (and Lawrence is NO De Niro).

The gags grow old really fast (the first time we saw the pig my wife said to me ""this is going to get old quick"" and she was right) and the `father/daughter bonding' element just feels like a regurgitated plot point with not fresh individuality.  In fact, a lot of the film comes across like a poor-mans version of highlights from OTHER films.  I actually thought that Donny Osmand was funny for a hot second and then, well, he wasn't anymore.  The whole thing just seemed really lazy and uninspired.  I have seen a lot of these teeny-bop brand family films, and some of them are quite entertaining and endearing and memorable.  `College Road Trip' is not one of those films.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the ridiculousness that was that slow motion `it's so sad to finally be going to college and have my daddy there happy for me' scene that comes at the end...roll my eyes retarded (it was like 5 minutes long!)

I'm not sure why so many seem to love this movie, but maybe the reviewers are really young (that's not meant as an insult, just an observation).  I can see that, since the humor here seems to be targeted at the 5-10 crowd, which baffles me since it was one of those movies that seemed to be thrust in the `tween' department.  I can't think of a single person over the age of 9 that is going to find this movie remotely funny.",1255305600,,2881,4.493282149712092

3346012,5,B0013J30UE,"Although some reviews may claim this to be overly cliche and to be kiddy by all means. I wish to disagree. Yes this movie is very predictable, however this is wholesome and absolute clean comedy. Some may say this is not a teenage movie, but why can't it be. Is it because it isn't pertaining to sex, or doesn't have risque moments in it, or because they are using acceptable language? Does those norms have to present for a movie to be considered teenage. With thinking like that I see how society has branded our teens useless and to mature for their ages. I a have daughter, but unfortunately she's only 4. If she were older and in her mid-teens I would most definitely take her to see this. This is a great movie with great morals and understanding to the thinking of parents and children. I believe this should be in everyone's dvd collection not only because of the great acting, but because it is wholesome and purely pure. This is what we're missing in our society.......PURITY..........and honestly if more of our teens demonstrated purity and childish behavior than just maybe our pregnancy and drug and alcohol epidemic would decline. As a parent and as a 23 year old I wish that I had that interaction with my parents and I surely wish to have that purity in my household as I raise my daughter. Childhood is childhood. Children should be kept as children and although teenage signifies a different stage it should not dictate your childs way of thinking. This is a teenage movie, but unfortunately parents today don't know the place of what a true teenager is. A true teenager isn't watching rated r movies, a true teenage doesn't laugh only at sexual related jokes, and surely a true teenager is never to old to spend wholesome with the family. Honestly I cannot wait to purchase this on dvd.

The relationship between a father and his overachieving daughter who is getting ready to depart for college hit on everything we went through with our older daughter (who is now headed to law school).  Our 7 year old laughed through most of the movie - and loved the science minded younger brother with his pet pig.  My husband (a military pilot who leans toward being overprotective) enjoyed the movie immensely, as did I.

There are fun situations for everyone in the family; work relationships, silly things we do under the guise of protecting family, use/overuse of technology (GREAT GPS sequence!), poking fun at stereoypes of older family members, and sentimental songs of growing up (a fun version of Double Dutch Bus by Raven Symone).

Martin Lawrence is a wonderful actor, infact everyone did a great job in this film and I think they deserve more credit for how well they performed.

To be honest I don't really see why any child under 13 would want to watch this movie, especially without their parents. It seems like this movie would be directed more to adults relating to this same problem of a child leaving the nest, or what this father thought was a problem, and of course the kids don't mind watching. Only because this movie was so, so, so, so, funny, I must have laughed atleast a dozen times, and I don't usually laugh that often while watching movies. Setting aside the comical spontaniousness all throughout the film it was very heartwarming and touching.

3346036,4,B0013J30UE,"Disney has always had a unique way of entertaining while teaching life lessons in their films, and College Road Trip is no exception to that rule!

Disney's College Road Trip tells the story of a battle for independence between a loving but protective father and his teenage daughter. Disney Channel favorite, Raven-Symone (TV's ""That's So Raven,"" ""Cheetah Girls""), stars as Melanie Porter, an overachieving high school student with her heart set on attending Washington D.C.'s Georgetown University. Martin Lawrence (Wild Hogs), turns in a great performance as the overbearing dad who wants her to stay closer to their Chicago home -- and will literally do whatever it takes to keep her there!

As the familiar Cinderella Castle is displayed and the film starts rolling, you know you are in for a great time! Martin Lawrence is at his best as the Dad who only wants the best for his daughter and Raven-Symone, and the rest of the cast (including Einstein the pig), keep everyone laughing from beginning to end.

However, even throughout the terrific comedic laughter, Disney has a deeper important message -- once in a while too much love can sometimes drown out what your children are really saying.

The film also hosts a variety of familiar actors and actresses from the Disney family including Donny Osmond, Brenda Song (Suite Life of Zack and Cody), and Lucas Grabeel (High School Musical).

The College Road Trip DVD presents the film in both full screen (1.33:1) and also widescreen amaphoric (2.35:1). The DVD itself is also full of extras including an alternative opening and ending scene, along with Raven's ""on the set video Diary"" and the music video of ""Double Dutch Bus"", performed by Raven-Symone.

College Road Trip is a great family film and hits close to home for parents having problems with letting their children grow up, which so many do because it is a very difficult task.",1218067200,,1897,4.949685534591195

I hate to say it but in my opinion the best sequences in the film revolve around the life-sized grinning Cheshire cat better known as Donny Osmond. His totally insane, off-the-wall performance was so far out there that it added a surreal atmosphere to an otherwise ordinary storyline.

This film is awful, how many ways are there to say it? It's a waste of time to watch, and a waste of time to review.

I love Martin Lawrence, Donny Osmond, Disney, and good G rated films, but this is just a bad movie.

I knew it was bad from the very start, when the mock-trial featured high school students with clown like wolf and pig noses rubber banded to their faces. It got worse from there.

I would have walked out after the first twenty minutes, but I forced myself to watch the whole movie so that I could see all of Donny's appearances. His performance is OK, more of the nerdy white guy schtick. There is about one funny joke in the entire movie, and Donny gets that at the very end. But nothing could be worth that wait. It's such a shame to see Donny's immense talent and charm absent from the screen for 30 years, only to surface in this wasteland. I'm glad to see him on the screen and his name in the credits, but I can't see how this is a good career move for him. Also, I wish he would be proud of his white style and awesome 1970s accomplishments, rather than trying to show that he's hip enough to recognize that he's nerdy. Trying to prove you're cool by showing that you recognize how uncool you are seems to be silly.

Why does Disney schlock out these supremely lame live action movies? With such masterful dramatic treatment of stories like Alice in Wonderland and The Little Mermaid, they have shown they know how to make a great story. It's sad.

The pig is a complete waste. If you are entertained by a pig walking on to the screen, then it might be ok. Except for one feature scene where he gets hopped up, that's all he does. The Einstein little brother is a complete waste. The wife is a complete waste. The crazy grandma is a complete waste. Basically I'm just compulsively typing to say that almost nothing works in this movie on any level.

There's one funny sequence where the GPS system takes them out to the wilderness. I've had that experience with GPS, many times.

Raven gives us one good performance of ""The Double Dutch Bus,"" and Donny gets one funny joke. Other than that, this film is horrible. For the last half hour I was fidgeting and internally screaming ""I can't take it anymore!"" Boy was I glad when it was over.",1206316800,6,2276,4.341176470588235
3346050,3,B0013J30UE,"There's a sequence in ""College Road Trip"" in which a pig destroys a wedding because it's hopped up on coffee beans. This is soon followed by Raven-Symon leading a busload of Asian tourists in a rendition of ""Double Dutch Bus."" Near the end of the film, Symon and Martin Lawrence become on-the-spot skydivers; they land in a golf course where they just happen to run into the man whose daughter's wedding was destroyed by the pig. I'd like to say that this material is expected of a G rated film, but is it really? It seems more likely that the filmmakers were just grabbing at comedic straws and hoping that something would come of it. I won't say that this movie is bad, because I'm well aware that it's aiming for younger audiences. But it definitely isn't trying very hard; the theme is transitioning into adulthood, but the sense of humor is the kind only young children can appreciate.

The plot: seventeen-year-old Melanie Porter (Symon) wants to attend Georgetown Universtiy in Washington D.C., but her insanely overprotective father, James (Lawrence), wants her to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Northwestern is only a forty-mile drive from their home just outside of Chicago, and as a police chief, he believes that such a short distance will keep his daughter safe. Besides, he had been planning this for her ever since she was born. He's clearly a control freak, which is partly why Melanie wants to go to a far-away college. But there's more to it than that: she wants to study law. Unbeknownst to James, a judge visiting her high school promised to arrange an interview for her at Georgetown. Also unbeknownst to James, Melanie and her friends had planned a road trip that would end up in Washington D.C. When he learns of all this, he decides to take Melanie on his own version of a road trip; hopefully, he can convince her that Northwestern is the best possible choice.

The comedic hijinx begin almost as soon as the trip. At the first stop--Northwestern--Melanie quickly discovers that her father staged an elaborate scheme; tour guides, students, and faculty all tell Melanie that Georgetown is a violent place. One person says that her father is smart and cool. After this fiasco, James' car gets a flat tire in the middle of the woods, and from this we discover that his brainy young son--Trey (Eshaya Draper)--has stowed away, along with his pet pig, Albert (who James doesn't trust; he calls him Houdini Pig). James jacks the car too far up, causing it to roll down a hill and into a ditch. They then stay at a hotel where the abovementioned wedding is being held. They then meet the father/daughter duo of Doug and Wendy Greenhut (Donny Osmond and Molly Ephraim), who are also on a college road trip. They happily drive James and Melanie to a bus station. Actually, ""happily"" is not a strong enough word here--they take perky to a level I don't care to describe.

Naturally, Melanie and James start reconnecting as the journey continues. But more importantly, James begins to realize that Melanie is no longer his precious little girl; he has to take the steps to let her go so that she can live her own life. Unoriginal, yes, but I think we all know that issues of love and trust play major roles in any such story. We even get the obligatory advice from Melanie's grandmother (Ametia Walker), required by the unspoken laws of family films to understand her granddaughter's frustration. None of that bothered me. What did bother me were scenes that took the comedy to unnecessary heights. Example: after sneaking into a sorority house to spy on Melanie, James is tasered by the sorority mother and arrested. Why did this scene have to be in the movie? Do you think young kids would find that funny? How many young kids actually know what a taser gun is? I suppose it may be more than I think, and that's sad when you stop and think about it.

Moments like that are genuinely bad. Everything else about the film is just mind-numbingly routine, offering nothing new in the way of character, theme, setting, or resolution. The best that can be said is that the actors look like they're having fun. This is especially true of Donny Osmond, who hams it up so thoroughly that it's more or less convincing. Raven-Symon seems to be in her element, but that isn't saying very much since her resume is largely composed of ""That's So Raven.""

I think by now you get the point I'm trying to make. Most films like this suffer because the filmmakers don't know how to handle the material; they make them too goofy or too sappy or too crazy, even when the story doesn't call for it. I didn't get that feeling from ""College Road Trip""--it seemed like the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing. That's fine, I guess, as long as you don't mind family films that are zany, sickly sweet, and predictable. I can pretty much guarantee that kids will enjoy this film, if not for its message, then for the delight of watching the adult characters do silly things. The pig will also get some laughs out of the little ones. Let's face it--the pig is damn cute. Parents, on the other hand, will get almost nothing from the film, save for a couple of tender moments between Lawrence and Symon. ""College Road Trip"" is only as good as it wanted to be, a fancy way of saying it didn't want to be very good at all.",1205193600,5,5337,4.643386243386243
