8449820,4,B004ZIELTY,"This movie is based on a Indian family's life based on status.  It proves you don't need great status in a Indian society in order to prove your worthiness to that family. This young man has proved it's great to help your community, which gives greater value in character. It also gives you great satisfaction and makes you a greater person, than having a prestigious job making lots of money. One brother is highly concern with money without thinking how his job will affect people, while the other brother is less concern about money and has a greater concern how things affect people.  Simple story, based on reality in our world.",1376092800,,633,4.693693693693693

It made me laugh and it made me cry. It's pure beauty! Ashmit Patel is one of my 6 all time favourite actors and his performance is just damn amazing! I love hearing him speak in English. I love his smile. I love his acting talent.

This movie is about the hardships of family, acceptance, the drive towards dreams, love, and protecting those who need protected. I truly love this movie! I would recommend this to EVERYONE! And I've already got my mum addicted to it. We quoted the entire movie during a recent road-trip. That tells you just how amazing I think it is. I plan on corrupting more people with this amazing movie and I hope you all might do the same one day. Give this movie a chance, be patient and open your heart to the script. You'll be stunned at how well written it is.

Peace out! <3",1356998400,,974,4.231182795698925

It is just a great story, mainly about the one son's journey and how it relates to his family. It's very well told and I think most people will really relate to it.",1317081600,,279,3.9642857142857144
