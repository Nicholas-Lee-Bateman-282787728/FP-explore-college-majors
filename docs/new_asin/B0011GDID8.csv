8241813,4,B0011GDID8,It's ok. Performs more like Kung fu. A difficult form. Well described though. You can definitely learn it with this. Well shot,1409875200,,126,4.7727272727272725
8241814,5,B0011GDID8,Chen is a dynamic Tai Chi.  This is definetley not old folks Tai Chi.  The instructor is amazing just to watch.  Good instruction and fairly good production quality.,1403913600,2,165,4.821428571428571
8241815,5,B0011GDID8,This is by far one of the greatest Tai-Chi systems I have ever trained with! The steps are a little difficult and the New Yorker accent of the guy narrating the program is a little difficult to comprehend and follow. But the instructor and the steps are part of an incredible Tai-Chi system and I am excited about my continued practice and learning this style completely!,1382400000,3,371,4.636363636363637
8241816,1,B0011GDID8,"Unfortunately, Tseng (who goes by the name of Chen), can only go through the motions of the Chen form.

His ""fah jing"" consists of fast movements that are not properly connected, and he offers no real connection to any real Chen style training source.  He appears to be a generalist who has learned forms but has no real understanding of the Tai Chi taught by the Chen family.

It has been reliably reported that Tseng and his protege' (Bing) were unable to deal with a local , long time, well trained American Chen stylist.

Tseng only proves the adage that ""Taoism needs Tai Chi, but Tai Chi does not need Taoism"".

If you want real Chen style, please check out Chen Xiao Wang or his student Ren Guang Yi.",1153872000,,707,4.449612403100775
8241817,5,B0011GDID8,"I used this video to learn Chen form (without the benefit of a teacher).  The tape quality seemed fine to me.  It was easy to learn from - the camera zoomed in and out, showing every part of the body for every move.  The  movements were repeated, one by one and the form was shown a few times  straight through.  This is a nice tape.  I still watch it just to get a  feeling of the fluidity and power of the movements (hopefully to  incorporate that into how I perform it).",959299200,10,473,4.1098901098901095
