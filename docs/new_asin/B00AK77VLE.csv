5445093,3,B00AK77VLE,The best I can say is that I love Handel's music. Maybe it is the artists' voices that make my appreciation a little less enthsiatic.,1370476800,,133,4.36
5445094,5,B00AK77VLE,"Unlike the first three reviewers... I loved it. They described it accurately... three counter tenors, set it the warehouse of a museum, Zazzo not particularly macho, etc. etc. BUT it was a completely different concept from what people are used to. First Zazzo was fantastic at giving Natalie space for her comedic talents and doing that dance with her. Second Cleopatra was developed as a very young, good humored, emotional woman not a sophisticated queen. Third the second counter tenor (Dumaux singing Tolemeo) was a fantastic bad guy and his acting and singing were superb. Incidentally he sang Tolemeo in the famous Glyndebourne production,and this one, and this year's at the Met. Why... because he's super at it. Next Cornelia and Sesto were both excellent. The Egyptian bad guy General whose name eludes me was quite good.
The most important difference was that I am not put off by nontraditional productions. Among these there are, of course, plenty of not so good productions, but some great ones. IMHO this was a great one. I must have watched it fifteen times. I confess that I'm a big Dessay fan, but I think I can tell the difference between her great and not so good work. I think this may be one of her very best. By the way. Emmanuelle Haim and Laurent Pelly are also very good at what their parts were.",1366934400,24,1320,4.7186147186147185
5445095,2,B00AK77VLE,I returned the product because it was defective there were 3 or 4 places where the disc froze for a minute or so - finally starting again.  So I returned it.,1364515200,,157,4.064516129032258
5445096,3,B00AK77VLE,"Natalie Dessay is, of course, quite fetching and sings as one
expects a diva to sing, though. to tell the truth this comes pretty
close to being a strip tease as well.  But Caesar is entirely unbelievable.
Perhaps this is Handel's fault for using castrati for the part;
castrati are in short supply these days.  This is a huge historical
inaccuracy; Caesar was about as virile as virility gets.",1364083200,5,394,4.695652173913044
5445097,3,B00AK77VLE,"Guilio Cesare is a static, stand-and-deliver piece in the Baroque tradition of opera, with one aria following another and very little ensemble or choral music. To compensate, the creative team chose the storage basement/warehouse of a museum in which the singers come to life from statuary or paintings. So far so good. Superb singer-actor Natalie Dessay predictably delivers a superb performance. The remainder of the cast are a mixed bag, but all at least are acceptable. In contrast to the Beverly Sills recording from the 70's, this production uses three countertenors, a vocal type that not all will find pleasing.

I would have given a 4 or 5 star rating for the music, despite the countertenors. But apparently to keep the viewer from becoming bored, this production includes museum staff constantly in motion as they work on the objects in storage, moving pieces here and there, sometimes interacting with the singers (who themselves are objects) and otherwise distracting from the music. After a while the annoyance level soars. The singers have plenty of acting and moving to do, and most do so well without diminishing the experience of the music.

I purchased this DVD on the basis of a rave review in one of the music magazines, possibly BBC Music. I wish I hadn't. Between the constant stage business and the time occupied by countertenors, I found myself being less and less interested in this very long (3h40m) opera. Individual reactions, I would think, will vary a lot. I wish I had searched YouTube before I took the plunge. I regret my purchase.",1359763200,24,1565,4.946768060836502

8552965,4,B00AK77VLE,"Ranking among the best operatic outputs of the great G. F. Handel, alongside the likes of Tamerlano, Alessandro, Rhodelinda, Rinaldo, Alcina, Amadigi di Gaula, Orlando, this opera is among the earliest revived masterpiece of Handel.  As early as the mid-20th century it was being regularly staged, though not in the historically informed mode as in the latter part of the last century.  The work is therefore widely recorded, both live or in studio, and on video as well.  The early revivals of Giulio Cesare in Egitto saw a 're-casting' of roles in the romantic operatic style - Cesare is reserved for a bass-baritone, and great singers like Cesare Siepi and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau both assumed the role to distinction.
Before and since the HIP movement, this opera has posed no small casting problems over the past decades of its revival. The titular hero Cesare is composed for alto castrato (Senesino) and so is the villain Tolomeo. In this production we have two countertenors filling the bills for these two major male characters, and this is a dramatically convincing arrangement.
Sesto, on the other hand, was a trouser role in the original version, being sung originally by a mezzo-soprano Margaretha Durastanti. In the early revival period, divers tenors have assumed this role, including Peter Schreier(under Karl Richter). In this production we have new American mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard singing Sesto. The original Cleopatra was Francesca Cuzzoni. Conductor Haim chose here French compatriot Nathalie Dessay.  This is a wise choice, even if Dessay is no longer in her absolute vocal prime in 2012. She is in more healthy vocal state than a year later at the MET. The young contralto Varduhi Abrahamyan is a rich-voiced Cornelia, if not out right as refined as Patricia Bardon (in the MET version).
In the title role Lawrence Zazzo competent, if not outright great. Certain enunciation problem with vowels impeded an otherwise powerful and dramatic performance. Christophe Dumaux is a dramatically outstanding Tolomeo.but both he and Zazzo did not toss the coloraturas and fioriture as they might otherwise would if the conducting is less hectic and angular.
Suffering from a similar plight is Abrahamyan's Cornelia. The pathos of her role was not being given full elaboration. New comer Isabel Leonard owns a voice to die for, but has yet to polish it to bring forth real vocal focus in the big arias.  Her stage presence is great and her portrayal of a young boy is very convincing.
Tremendous stage activities impede the dramatic flow rather than enhancing them, alas.
Nathalie Dessay's attire as Cleopatra is also controversial, but her acting is always pristine and shiny despite all distractions on stage.
Veteran character countertenor Dominique Visse is also dramatically oustanding as the eunuch Nireno, though the intonation has flagged some what.
New singers like Leonard and Abrahamyan are the main reasons for getting this DVD.",1414281600,,2958,5.205882352941177
8552966,5,B00AK77VLE,"I've seen her twice in the same role, once with extravagent clothing, once with the see through sheer as shown on this cover.  In both productions,  she is a brilliant, funny, clever comic actress with a beautiful voice.  Others have denigrated her voice as she gets older,  but as an amateur at opera,  I find it beautiful.",1410652800,,324,4.614035087719298
8552967,5,B00AK77VLE,Yet another stunning Baroque opera. You cannot go wrong with David Daniels. Wonderful cast... and with two remarkable contra tenors. Just a treat to the ear and eyes.,1394409600,,166,4.964285714285714
8552968,4,B00AK77VLE,"I liked the production very much, in general.  I did not find it overly-busy as some did.  My only objection was the first scene, when Achilla brings in the head of Pompeo, it is just a very large head from a stone statue.  It did go well with the production, but I think they should have then added in the real severed head as every production I've seen does, because Cesare's response to the 'wicked man's cruelty' doesn't have as much force in reference to a statue-head, versus a real one.  Otherwise, I liked the production in general.

The costumes were for the most part, nice, but Dessay's were distracting to me, as she had one breast falling in and out of her dress for almost the whole show.  For one long scene, at least they gave us a break from guessing about it, by simply showing her in a half-dress, or a completely ""off-the-breast"" dress, but then we had one of her little breasts staring at us for a long scene that was also distracting.  I don't really mind the nudity too much though, as they are in Egypt and it is hot there.  The thing that was really disturbing was the vulgar twerking.  I don't mind a few lewd suggestions, but Dessay came across to me as cheap and disgusting.

The singing: it is the best of the commercial videos and I will play this one again as an audio recording.  Many are comparing this one to the Glyndebourne production, so I will follow suit.  Lawrence Zazzo is no Sarah Connolly, but he is cute, and has a pretty, reasonably full-bodied voice, with reasonable coloratura abilities.  The Cornelia and the Sesto are both an absolute delight in this video and exceed the pair in the Glyndebourne video.  Christophe Dumaux is similarly mediocre as he is at Glyndebourne.  Dessay sings wonderfully, is better than De Niese, however De Niese is a good singer, prettier, and a better comedic actress.  I will not comment on the Achilla, because I don't remember exactly how I felt about him.  The biggest blight of all in this video is the Nireno - where do they dig up these horrible countertenors?  It makes the whole countertenor fach come off as a big joke.  I'm sure he was supposed to be funny in his little dress and squawky voice, but it was just frightening and ugly.  And yes, he sang his aria in it's complete form - painful. The Nireno in the Glyndebourne production is kind of cute and not a horrible singer.

And may I say, I just watched part of the Met Cesare with David Daniels and Dessay, and please do not wait on that one.  Any complainers about Zazzo, would probably begin to praise him after hearing Daniels and his tiny, breathy girl-voice struggling to sing five or more 16th notes without sliding them into an unmusical and bumpy portamento-like phrase - so ugly-sounding.  Handel deserves better.

01-20-2014 update:  I played this recording audio-style only and noticed again the prettiness of Zazzo's voice, along with the entire cast sans the Nireno and the Achilla.  The Achilla in the Glyndbourne video is much better - this one has an ugly voice, plus he seems unsteady at the top.  Although I noticed this time that Dessay was a little tired-voiced, she is still my favorite Cleopatra ever and I love her singing in this video.  Also, I was surprised to find myself liking Zazzo every bit as much as I liked Conolly.  He might be a bit more interesting to listen to, although not quite as tasteful and tidy as Conolly.  Both made physically pleasant-looking Cesares.  I was possibly unfair to Dumaux, the Tolomeo in both videos.  His singing might be beyond 'mediocre'.  It's a pretty voice with reasonable coloratura abilities.  The voice is sometimes a bit hard to hear depending on the aria being sung, but sometimes he is quite impressively pretty-sounding in this video and he is never bad. And yes, the Nireno in this one was just as frighteningly ugly-sounding as I thought the first time through.  Thank goodness it's only one aria.",1387843200,3,3919,4.614161849710983
8552969,4,B00AK77VLE,"I bought this because I love Handel's operas.  I have 12 of them, including an earlier version of this one, in English, with Janet Baker.  All of them are great, except for a horrible Eurotrash version of Alcina, which I just can't watch.  I'm really fond of Natalie Dessay, and thought it would be good to have the Italian version (though actually the text of English version is really good...I wonder if it's a contemporary translation from Handel's period...does anyone know?

This is a great performance.  Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find the stagehands moving around distracting at all.  In fact, it was nice to have some movement, something going on, since the opera is awfully static (like the rest of Handel's operas).  All the singers are great, with one exception, and that's why I gave it four instead of five stars.  Dessay is terrific, Ptolemy almost steals the show, Cornelia and Sextus are wonderful....

The exception is the countertenor who sings Caesar.  His voice is fine, but his acting is beyond awful.  What on earth was he doing with his face?  I assume the real Julius Caesar was masculine, noble, the sort of thing you'd imagine a Roman conqueror to be.  This guy looks as though he playing a clown in a Christmas pantomine.  He grimaces and twitches and mugs. Time for some acting lessons....",1385251200,2,1328,4.79295154185022
8552970,4,B00AK77VLE,"Dessay is enchanting. Her voice and her athletic use of the blocking directions continue to amaze. She accomplishes movements that very few, if any, of today's singers could. The downside of her tremendous stamina, voice and body, and her joie de vivre is that she may encourage directors who continue to block the movements of opera singers in outrageous ways that send them to unusual heights as they climb over shaky stage pieces -- and all while singing.
The prop warehouse is an interesting way to bring visual interest to this Handel opera: especially pertinent as the principal soprano does wrap herself in a rug. Still, the prop men are frequently distracting. Constant physical movement can distract from the movement of the voice. It seems that directors don't trust us to be alone with the music.",1384992000,,807,4.9411764705882355
8552971,2,B00AK77VLE,"Furtunately I caught this on my cable oulet and did not spend any money on it. I have an older version with the same staging on DVD done at Glyndebourne in 2005 and much prefer it. Danielle de Niese is FAR superior to Dassay and I prefer Connolly's Mezzo to the counter tenor, of whom I did not think much at all. I think the Tolomea was the same and is pretty good.

If you want to get this to keep, get the 3 DVD set (Believe now available on Blu-Ray) version.",1379894400,,462,4.021739130434782
8552972,5,B00AK77VLE,"Only opera can do justice to a story of this magnitude--and Natalie Dessay embodies her role to perfection.  Of course, Handel is always a joy!",1374019200,4,143,4.72
8552973,5,B00AK77VLE,"This version of Giulio Cesare is excellent and I was pleased to find in one production two of my favorite French singers, Natalie Dessay and Christophe Dumaux",1373673600,,158,4.888888888888889
