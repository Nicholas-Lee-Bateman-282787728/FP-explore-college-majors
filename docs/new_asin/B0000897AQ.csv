1831161,4,B0000897AQ,"Mostly this is part of history that we haven't seen in the books:
where German nationals ( like the Japanese in California) were rounded up and warehoused for the duration of the war.
The drama starts when a German music teacher who is an expatriot and his wife are taken away and his wife dies of an heart attack.
The murder of a German woman who is married to a magistrate and
has escaped being sent to the camp is the subject of this episode.
The acting and script writing are very good here
and the look at WWII Britain is nice.",1230076800,,532,4.2254901960784315
1831162,5,B0000897AQ,"I am a mystery buff of several decades.  I live, almost, to read or watch good mysteries.  I used to be a career fraud investigator for 15 years. I know from what I speak here. The best way for me to express my beliefs about this DVD and the series in general is to say it is by far the BEST mystery series I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  The actors give flawless performances.  I'd like to meet each one in person, in character, to see how they become who they portray. I'd like to meet them in person and congratulate them on how well done their jobs were. This DVD and others in the series are stories you want to watch over and over.  They never tire!
I have them all and pray for any others that might be produced!  For me, it is impossible to select a favorite DVD among the lot.  They are all A1, Prime Cuts to me.",1202515200,11,832,4.036585365853658
1831163,5,B0000897AQ,"PBS's ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre introduces Foyle's War; a four-episode murder-mystery series set in historic Hastings, England (i.e. The Battle of Hastings) at the onset of World War II. This is a much welcome installment for PBS Mystery! devotees as corporate sponsors have, unfortunately, been few-and-far-between in recent years.  Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle is perfectly portrayed by Michael Kitchen, a Masterpiece Theatre alumnus, and he lends an easy-going charm and compassion to the serious and determined Foyle, who calmly tracks down the assorted murderers.
""The German Woman"" starts the series off with a flourish (and two murders). It boasts an enviable cast of redoubtable British actors (Edward Fox, Robert Hardy, David Horovitch, Dominic Mafham, Rosamund Pike, etc...) and contains wonderful production values, so that the period atmosphere of English village life is fully evoked. The plot concerns the murder of the German wife of a wealthy Englishman and, despite powerful anti-German sentiments, Foyle focuses on treating the case as he would any other murder inquiry -- by rooting out the murderer and bringing them to justice. This is Foyle's strength and his Achilles' heel. As Foyle is so intent on justice, his superiors will not release him from his civic duties -- much to his chagrin. Foyle would rather be supporting the war effort by fighting in the front lines. To complicate matters, Foyle's son, Andrew, has signed up with the RAF as a pilot. Foyle's world is quickly unfurling through events that he cannot control, yet, ironically, he must maintain control in his district -- else chaos ensues. This intelligent and thoughtful series, and especially this premier episode, is highly recommended for viewers who enjoy a well-crafted mystery. In addition, they will be transported back to an incredibly dangerous and courageous time in world history by this realistically produced series.",1045785600,16,1945,5.461794019933555
7980554,4,B0000897AQ,"My wife and I have enjoyed the entire ""Foyle's War"" series.  This is a very good episode but it is also a very sad one for a couple of reasons that I won't divulge because it would ruin the plot.  I must add that the tune that the combo plays from 36:59-39:41 is just a hauntingly beautiful waltz.  AFAIK, it's part of the original score by Jim Parker but so aptly fits the genre of jazz for that period.  I just want to put it on continuous loop without the actor's lines...<sigh>....",1487635200,,485,4.239130434782608

7980563,5,B0000897AQ,"The series ""Foyle's War"" dramatizes what it was like for a Detective Chief Inspector in England in 1940 during World War II having to carry on regular police criminal investigations while the war was raging. Anti-German sentiment ran high during the war, and in the first episode of the series, ""The German Woman,"" the plot centers on the wife of a patrician magistrate, a German woman, who is getting special treatment because of her husband's influence. Germans living in Britain were classified as aliens, and if they lived within five miles of the coast they were interned, but the wife was allowed to stay in the family mansion.
It has a complex plot with many strands and sets out the character of Inspector Christopher Foyle (played brilliantly by Michael Kitchen. It shows his first meeting with his attractive but nosey female driver (played by Honeysuckle Weeks) who proves to be a good detective and a valuable asset and his hiring of the police sergeant who has lost a leg in combat. Foyle is under personal stress because his young son is headed for the service.
It's a clever plot with a large number of suspects as two murders and the tragic death of a young girl from a stray German bomb occur. All the elements of the classic British murder mystery are there with the added element of the War. The episode has beautiful cinematography featuring the idyllic British countryside, and excellent acting prevails throughout. There's a cameo role by Edward Fox as the chief police superintendent.
 War plays a part in all four episodes in this first set: the arrest of a woman on sabotage charges, a cell of Nazi sympathizers, a conscientious objector, and the movement of museum treasures to keep them safe from bombings.
The series hallmark is authenticity. Civilians had to carry their gas mask bags with them wherever they went; we see the old vehicles, the clothes, the old railroad trains, and we become aware of the importance of radio in a pre-TV era. London is shown in the wartime atmosphere of blackouts, barbed wire, sand bags, and the threat of air raids.
If you're a fan of the old British mysteries as I am, you are going to be delighted with this very well-crafted series. Cheers!",1276214400,2,2207,4.777486910994765
