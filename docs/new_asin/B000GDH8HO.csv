8130690,5,B000GDH8HO,I love Ghost Hunters (TAPS) I would recomend this series to anyone who likes a good mystery or semi scary expierence,1207612800,,116,4.571428571428571
8130691,2,B000GDH8HO,"Don't get me wrong I like TAPS.  I like the crew, the quality and the stories.  However you don't need to buy this particular DVD to get the stories.  These are copied stories of season 1 & 2.  I bought Season 1,2, and part of three as well as this one at the same time.  I figured it would have additional features, added stories and commentary.  It didn't just the same stuff.  Keep your money and just buy the seasons you won't miss anything.",1206921600,2,445,4.226190476190476
8130692,5,B000GDH8HO,"I gave this as a Christmas present to my boyfriend.  He started watching it right away!  I saw some of it too, and it's a good sampling of what's on the tv show.",1199232000,,161,3.8484848484848486
8130693,5,B000GDH8HO,"i love anything to do with ghosts.i bought ghost hunters volume 1 best of a while back and i loved it.i personally wouldn't go into a known haunted house ( well, not on my own ).these guys are fantastic and to hear the E.V.P they got in 2 houses 1st house a man and 2 children and the 2nd house a man saying 'i miss adam'.adam is this man's grandson and to hear this young lad's dead grandad on tape was freaky.i have ordered other ghost hunters dvds.i can't wait to watch them.
i've ordered ghost hunters volume 2 best of and i can't wait to get it.
i know ghost hunters volume 2 best of will be just as good.
worth buying these dvds SCARE THE CRAP OUTTA YE but! pure gold",1190851200,,673,4.067669172932331
8130694,5,B000GDH8HO,"i love Jason and Grant and the whole team ! can watch it over and over again , never miss a show . i bought this DVD so i can watch it anytime i want . sometimes you miss something the first time you see a show , love it , love it .",1186963200,,232,3.314814814814815
8130695,5,B000GDH8HO,"I wouldn't purchase this DVD when you can get 1/2 of it free from ITUNES (the top 20 show).

The TOP 20 is worth having though. Great stuff!",1174089600,,140,4.0
8130696,4,B000GDH8HO,"If you have Ghost Hunters Season 2, Vols. 1 & 2, you'll notice that two episodes are missing.  The Top 20 countdown and the Halloween Special, both of which are contained on this ""Best of"" DVD.  But note, these are the only 2 episodes on the disc.  While I'm glad that these episodes are available, it seems dumb to put them on a separate disc when they were a part of the regular season.  A double dip?  You make the call!  The Halloween Special is particularly of interest to fans because it's where Brian Harnois is allowed back into TAPS, making its omission from the season confusing.

While I love having Ghost Hunters on DVD, please ""powers that be,"" hire a different company in the future.  These transfers and audio mixes are the worst ever.  Because they're so bad, I'll only rent these titles instead of buying them.  If, however, they rectify these issues, I would buy them in a second.",1169683200,15,898,4.521739130434782
