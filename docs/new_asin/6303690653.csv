713139,2,6303690653,"Although I can't say you don't get your money's worth out of this set.  It is a warning to those of you who would like to keep your value of your money.  Truthfully these megapacks were great.  In particular, the black and white horror classics box is spectacular.  Maybe part of the reason is the atmosphere a terrible transfer adds to those films.

However with 50 Chilling Classics, mostly horror.... I couldn't wait to see some of these films.  As it turns out the transfers of the color films makes them worthless.  The sound is terrible, the color is extremely dull and faded.  This can turn a great film into a campy trash film just due to the quality of the product.

An example is if you own ""Deep Red"" Directed by Dario ARgento, Anchor bay put out a terrific transfer.  Of course you don't expect this copy to be perfect but, I didn't expect it to cheapen some of the films.  Believe me, some of the films don't need any cheapening!

Worth the money but don't expect it to be as good as the 50 horror mega pack.  The transfers are garbage and ruin most of the films.  I wouldn't pay over $15.00 for this set.  It's not worth a dime more.",1129593600,16,1147,4.31924882629108
713140,4,6303690653,"Bob Burril was the Photography Teacher at Samuel Ayer H.S. (which no longer exists).  If memory serves me, the project all started when one of the kids (Dave Kottas, I think) drew up a storyboard for a ten minute short.  Well things grew and snowballed and before you knew it, Milpitas Monster was born. The original theater production opened with a song by Tennessee Ernie Ford that he did for the film--A six degrees thing.  THe original film and subsequent videos were better production value than this 1995 release.  I remember seeing it in video stores back in the 70s. We were just kids and at least for my part (which were several) I didn;t know what I was doing, but Bob Burrill did and I guess that's what counted.  He would say, go over here and do this and say that...Every thing was taken in one shot.  Had too--it was shot in 35mm if I remember and wile there was some local funding, Bob probably took a lot out of his pocket. The destruction of the Kozy Kitchen, etc..what great mock ups we had.  I don't know who did them, but the minatures were great.  The costumes of the Monster were done by moms and the girls,  Patty Thorpe comes to mind.  Hey we even had a big Monster hand and claws for those ""grab scenes""...High school in the early to mid 70s--a last age of innocence. Small town Milpitas.  None of exists anymore.  Demographics changed--But as to the film--a rush of memories of another time, another place...A simple film. Who was I in the film?Tooly.  One of the gang that went around in the old Chevy Nomad.  I stole the chemicals from the lab and was n other various scenes.  Anything I could get into..what a hog I was  Ha!  Jeez I looked so young and well ""fruity"".  If I wasn't so much older now, I would be embarassed. Enjoy the film.",1106870400,4,1767,4.401234567901234
713141,5,6303690653,"""The Milpitas Monster"" is a fun film for the casual viewer. Produced in the mid 1970's. Although it's obviously not a Hollywood creation (it was made by high school students in the (then) small town of Milpitas, California), it is definitely a classic.  You'll want to view this with your kids if they are currently learning about recycling, the environment, etc. since it's plot is about a garbage-eating monster that terrorizes the good citizens of Milpitas when they start overfilling the local landfill.  The monster is obviously a guy dressed up in a suit; although a very cool suit. (I recommend it for ages 8 and up...won't scare them, and may make them laugh!).  Overall, keep your sense of humor and don't expect exceptional sound and cinematography of ""The Milpitas Monster"", but do expect a real neat family movie experience with a moral about trash, clean air...
P.S.  Milpitas is a real place located just North of San Jose along freeway 680.  If you ever get the chance to visit, expect to recognise very little of the town from what you saw in ""The Milpitas Monster"".  Since the computer boom of the 1980's, Milpitas has grown in leaps and bounds.  And, I'm happy to say, has managed to keep the monster from re-appearing!",1080000000,2,1237,4.779342723004695

Imagine if the high school kids in Dazed and Confused made a monster movie while under sedation and you have Milpitas Monster, which was made by a bunch of high school students in the 70s. The monster is fantastic, a mix of stop motion and use of miniatures, and is shown frequently through out. What were cheap effects back in the day look kinda surreal now.

Question; how does a normal conversation between two people continue as they walk away from each other? Answer, they don't unless the movie is dubbed and the timing or synchronization is completely off. Since this was obviously an English movie made here in the U.S. it's quite obvious that the budget was very low. The premise of a monster being created out of trash was pretty childish.

713661,4,6303690653,"You don't buy sets like this looking for brilliant films, or even brilliant pictures or sound; you buy them because you enjoy cheesy (mostly public domain) films.  In that sense, how can you be disappointed?  However, it is annoying when the set you get does not contain the films in the publisher's listing.  I'm not sure whether I ended up with a newer set (as I suspect), or an older one, but there are 7 films different from the listing in the set I got.  Here's what they are:

LISTED BUT NOT IN THE SET I GOT

Bad Taste
Crypt of the Living Dead
Deep Red
Gothic
Memorial Valley Massacre
Snake People
Virus

CONTAINED INSTEAD

Hearse, The
Land of the Minotaur
Murder Mansion, The
Nightmare in Wax
Passenger to Bali, A
Shock
Snow Beast

So, all I'm saying is that if any of these 14 films are critical to you buying the set, you'll need to check carefully which version of the set you're getting.  I think mine is the newer version, but I wouldn't swear to it.  Mill Creek, whose releases I enjoy, should be much more up front and pro-active when the contents of their sets change.",1420243200,,1084,4.396984924623116

713666,4,6303690653,"This is one of those monster movies that's so awful it's good. The monster is cheesy, the writing almost comical, and the acting... well, let's just say it didn't win any Oscars. But the film also doesn't take itself too seriously, which gives it its charm. There's also a wonderful bonus for Paul Frees fans: Anyone over 40 will immediately recognize Frees narrated the opening/closing sequences.

Your initial reaction to ""The Milpitas Monster"" may be, ""This looks like it was put together by a bunch of high schoolers."" That's because it pretty much was. It's a local production, with a monster-movie take on a local problem, starring local folks. Even the mayor of Milpitas got in on the act.

If you like slick, high-budget, CG monster movies, ""The Milpitas Monster"" is not for you. But if you're looking for 83 minutes of sheer mindless monster-movie entertainment, give it a shot.

What prompted me to grab it was my surprise with it's companion comp, PURE TERROR, which was great. This one is similar. Yeah, there's the usual dreck that fills out such comps (THE DEVIL'S HAND, I BURY THE LIVING, NIGHTMARE IN WAX), oddball stuff inserted merely to fill out the 50 films designation (LEGEND OF BIGFOOT, A PASSENGER TO BALI, SHOCK), and stuff that really isn't horror, just horrible (MEDUSA, SLASHED DREAMS). What interested me was the number of flicks here that are rare or unavailable elsewhere. MESSIAH OF EVIL, DEVIL TIMES FIVE, and BELL FROM HELL are examples. Then you have intriguing sounding flicks like THE COLD, THE HEARSE, and HAUNTS, that sound like they might make decent viewing experiences. I'll have to see. Of course, there's also loveable low rent schlock like TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST, HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND, and WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS DORMITORY that are what they are, namely Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder.

I'm looking at 'Virus' right now which was a 'virus' for the Japanese financiers who financed it in the 1970s.  it was shot in super scope (perhaps 70mm) and had expensive production values but the print here is a ragged TV copy.  the Peter Jackson primer  'Bad Taste' is something of an embarrassment but certainly not a disgrace; the action is non-stop, if confusing, but it's worth seeing...once.  Obviously, I lucked out in getting the early version of this set which included these aforementioned standouts.  the collection pictured to the left is NOT the one I ordered, thankfully.  this 'new' version has many of the usual 'repeat' public domain titles already in other Mill Creek sets.  watch out.",1401753600,2,1070,4.835164835164835

While this zero-budget eco-monster spoof decries the pollution brought on by landfills, the shaky aerial footage at the film's beginning shows a Milpitas made up of rolling green fields that stretch for acres. Today, that entire section of the South Bay has been paved over, converted into business parks, and polluted by far worse industrial waste from Silicon Valley's tech giants than anything imagined by the high school kids (!) who made this purpose-driven schlock back in 1975. The sound quality is atrocious, but the stop-motion animation is, well, stop-motion animation, and stop-motion is always cool. A guy in a fur and rubber suit is also used for some of the monster scenes when the teen auteurs figured out that stop-motion takes a crap-load of time. If that isn't enough, there is a theme song that's kinda rockin' in a 70s AM gold sort of way + an appearance by beloved ""Creature Features"" host Bob Wilkins. KTVU Channel 2 (there's only one) is thanked several times in the opening and closing credits as are Browning Ferris Industries (BFI) the same mobbed-up outfit that collects my trash to this very day. Rounding things out are a 30s style wino, some teen drama involving bitchin' muscle cars, and a scene shot at the Port of Redwood City (my ancestral homeland) back when dirtheads were still allowed to live in housebouts there. However the most striking thing about ""The Milpitas Monster"" is that this exercise in cinema verite once brought this whole sleepy piece of suburbia together as trash collectors, bartenders, maintenance workers and various public officials all seem to be playing themselves.

The movies in this collection are all public domain titles, and have been transferred mostly as is. Still, this collection has some excellent films like Horror Express, I Bury The Living, The Ghost, and Man In The Attic with Jack Palance. Shock, with Vincent Price is a first rate thriller, unfortunately, Mill Creek's transfer has some severe audio problems and it's very difficult to understand. I could tell it was a very good movie, so I bought Shock on it's own from Fox's noir series. The Fox version has superb image and audio quality.
There's a nice selection of campy titles and little known 'B' movies in the ""Chilling Classics"" box like Lady Frankenstein, Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon, and Hands Of A Stranger.
Several Cameron Mitchell films are in this package if you admire his work. Surprisingly, Mill Creek offers a few true 16 X 9 Widescreen transfers which are of high DVD quality: They include The Hearse, Nightmare In Wax, and Land Of The Minotaur, from Crown International Pictures. The movies are on 12 double sided discs and the image quality is much better than usual. There's really only one drawback to this collection.

714074,4,6303690653,"Time for another 50 pack from Mill Creek. This time it's the Chilling Classics 50 movie pack. It was actually the first product from Mill Creek that I ever purchased. My case is different than the one pictured. They now come in large clam-shell keep cases, which is much better than the cardboard case with Velcro spots to keep the cover closed that I have, which is what they started out packaging their movie packs in. I can also tell you that there are a lot of good movies in this pack. So good in fact, that I went out and tracked down the best DVD copies of eight of the movies in this set. As I said in my last Mill Creek review, I look at these packs as a primer for the genre they represent, and I helped out some independent DVD companies along the way by purchasing their superior DVD transfers of the movies I saw and liked on this Mill Creek set.

Now, for a small buyer beware. This set originally came out in 2005. I'm not sure if any of the transfers have been updated in the set pictured above, and if not, this set has quite a few audio and picture anomalies. Do not buy this set to replace any DVDs you might already have, or to save space, you will be highly disappointed. There are a few movies on this set that you'll find no other release for, and that's great. Also, fifty movies for ten to fifteen dollars can't be beat, but there are only two widescreen transfers in this package, and most if not all of the films are of VHS quality at the best. So just to clear that up ahead of time for you, let's get into the movies themselves.

Pins on the map represent the plots with black pins showing those plots occupied and white pins showing those plots sold but not in use. The chairman mixes up some of the pins and discovers that the owners of some plots he inadvertently marked with a black pin suddenly die. He comes to realize that he has the power to cause the death of the plot owners by simply marking their site with a pin. -(Fullscreen/B&W) / Audio:Fair / Video:Fair

50. Drive-In Massacre-(Starring-Jake Barnes-1974-Rated R)-Two police detectives investigate a series of murders at a California drive-in theater. Someone has been murdering unsuspecting movie patrons with a massive sword, during the showing of a western. The killings mount as the detectives try to close in on the psychotic killer, hoping to stop him before he can claim any more victims. This film was part of may double bill drive-in theater shows in the mid-1970's. -(Fullscreen/Color) / Audio:Fair / Video:Fair

There's the 50 films. You'll notice that the transfers aren't as good as those found in the Sci-Fi Collection.

50 movies for a low price sounds great....but that's only a bargain if the movies are watchable and entertaining.  I expected low budget, no problem.  Well, they did bring the low budget, that's for sure.  However, 90% of the movies in this set are as dull as dirt and terribly terribly boring.  Not entertaining at all.

The fact that so many people in these reviews were clamoring for movies like ""Deadtime Stories"" should tell the good people at Mill Creek what their audience is. I knew sadly, that Deadtime was not on the list of movies anymore, but I thought this collection would contain more movies in that vein.  However the movies they did include are mostly unwatchable, because they are not fun at all.  I doubt if any of the people responsible for picking the movies for this set knew anything about their intended audience.  It's like they said ""Hey. this movie has Robert Englund in it!"".  It's dull, insipid and has nothing to do with horror and suspense but we'll put it on there anyways...""

This set would have done better to include less movies, with higher fun factor.  Like Bad Taste and Gothic, both included in the set and very very fun.

Many people have complained about the production values and transfers.  That didn't bother me, because the bad quality lends a certain charm to public domain movies.

714301,1,6303690653,"I can speak from experience about the Milpitas Monster Movie because I am Robert Burrill the Produce-Director of this film.  Ya gotta start someplace, but back in 1973 the film began as a 10 minute short, an Homage to the film ""Godzilla Meets Bambi"" and of course the classic horror films from Japan. We had a great title that made people laugh and the film caught on and before we knew it we formed a booster club  and the film was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the City Council,our School District with support from the City's Public Works, Fire and Police departments.
Four years later the film premiered at the Serra Twin Theaters in Milpitas May 21 1976. The film sold out for a full week and received a proclamation into the Congressional Record in Washington D.C.  The bay area newspaper and television folks all got into the act and we were featured in the media across the country. We were approached by a film Producer from Texas who offered to buy the Motion Picture for $100,000, but we needed time to acquirer all the property and talent releases and permissions. The film sat in a closet for four years all tied up in red tape while the film was cut down to a shorter version of 85 minutes.

Finally about 1980 the film was sold to Huntford Printing of Milpitas who payed the lawyer bills and saw that the film was cut down to a final 70 minutes with improved sound hence, the film was distributed to television throughout the country and through New York internationally, in Australia, Canada and Europe.  Some how other new companies started to sell the pirated DVD's you now see on Amazon and E-Bay etc.

I would like the public to know they are buying copies of copies with a degraded quality. There seems to be some missing materials sent to the copyright office and a number of people have designed new covers, left my name on the film and think the film belongs to them.  Some of the new art work is very good, but is also Illegal.
Please buy the quality movie from the true owners ROBERT BURRILL and George Loughborough c/o HUNTFORD PRINTING  275 Dempsey Road Milpitas, CA 95035
Thank You for doing what is right.  Robert Burrill",1263427200,7,2158,4.541237113402062

Being a lover of 70s and 80s flicks, I was stoked when I found this CHILLING CLASSICS 50 Movie Pack at Rasputin in unplayed condition for only $7.95 (hell, even at $14.99 this collection's a steal)! Such a pittance for the number of 70s horror and schlock ""classics"" you get in this package! Although I've only watched like ten of them so far, my purchase of CHILLING CLASSICS has already paid for itself.

714304,4,6303690653,"This is a 12 double-sided DVD set containing 50 old movies(50's-80's) of the horror/sci-fi/thriller genre. There are many quality complaints regarding this set but then again these movies were not very high quality to begin with, so know what you are getting into. The biggest draw of this set, of course, is volume versus price. Some have argued that you are getting all 'crap' anyways, so the low price is irrelevant.

After having watched the entire set, I beg to differ. I've found that fully one-third of this is at least mildly enjoyable to watch. Eleven out of twelve DVD's had at least one movie that I enjoyed. Some of my strong favorites include Scream Bloody Murder(disc 2), Horror Express(disc 3), A Passenger to Bali(disc 6), and The Man in the Attic(disc 9). Part of the charm of this set for me is that most of these movies probably played in some type of drive-in.

To get a flavor of how the drive-in was like I recommend viewing some classic intermission clips available from Something Weird Video. Watch the intermission stuff in between two movies from this set and you'll get the feeling that you are watching a double-bill at a drive-in. For those who mostly enjoy the newer horror stuff I'd say stay away from this set.

For the cost, this was a bargain at under $20. The newer movies are for the most part, especially the horror type, too gory, vulgar and disgusting for me.

714364,1,6303690653,"Unbelievable. OK, I'm amazed that five pages of reviews focus on the cost vs the number of titles (must be Mill Creek employees that started that trend), or the quality of the movies. This is a 50-movie budget boxset...do people really expect A-grade films and become disappointed to find mostly B-movies and worse? Yes, folks...a 50-movie budget box is going to be packed with a mix of bombs and sleepers. The quality is going to also be mixed because these are public domain films and the sources are always going to vary. These details should be a given, and yet they are noted endlessly as if they are revelations and buyers should find this information unusual.

So as I waded through 47 reviews looking for some piece of unique information -- in this case, does Mill Creek pop their logo up throughout the film -- not a mention of this useful detail. Some even called the set Mill Creek's best compilation yet. I gritted my teeth and added it to my cart. I also knew that I was spinning the roulette wheel since Mill Creek have this disconcerting habit of releasing their sets with multiple versions, causing confusion when buyers purchase the set only to find that the movie they bought the set for is on an alternate version. Charming. In the software world, updated versions use version numbers, but even though Mill Creek update the box and discs, they can't be bothered to note a difference anywhere in the packaging so buyers have to play guesswork as all versions are lumped together here. Charming.

Those logos you see in the bottom corner of the screen are known in the industry as a ""bug"", which is ironic. And every fifteen minutes, you get to see Mill Creek's gaudy, non-translucent, obtrusive logo fade in, strike the pose, divert your attention away from the movie, then finally fade away until the next scheduled interval. Charming. That's the type of thing you expect from free TV, not something you pay for -- regardless of the cost per title. Would you buy a barrel of spoiled tomatoes just because the individual cost of each is mere pennies? Of course not. I like to pull out my movies, pop them up on the bigscreen for a cinema-style experience with my friends to simulate a theatrical showing. How is this possible when some little company is compelled to advertise themselves constantly, to remind you that this purchase you made came from them. It did serve the purpose for me, as that ugly logo is all I remember when I see this set on the shelf. I have several other Mill Creek sets that this does not occur on, and before writing this review, I had a whole bunch more ready to buy. Mind you, none of them are in my cart now. Nor will anything released by this company find its way into my cart. (I said that previously after this occured on their Cult Classics collection, but I was unwittingly lured in by the fact that the bug wasn't mentioned in any of the reviews...please note these things in your reviews folks, otherwise the practice will continue or get worse!)

These films are public domain. With a little diligence, I could have downloaded all fifty of them and that would be perfectly legal. And that is what I will do with the other titles that I would have gladly paid for before experiencing this transgression from yet another careless publisher. A response from Mill Creek? Yeah, assuming this review doesn't get buried on the last page, you'll see ""This review was not helpful"" numbers since, after all, why would informing potential buyers about the quality of the package be something consumers would have a problem with? Am I being a negative creep, a hater? Nope...just letting the public know what they are paying for (or not.) If none of these details bother you, then purchase away. If they do, let Mill Creek know by saving your hard-earned money or spending it with companies that don't expect you to pay for shameless self-promotion.",1223424000,240,3895,4.666666666666667
714365,4,6303690653,"This movie pack from mill creek entertainment contains 50 movies and who can argue with the value of that. But the movies are iffy some ranging from unwatchable to laugh out loud bad. These are your run of the mill eighties horror films. Picture quality like all budget dvds is terrible some of the films are to dark to see others are blurry fiddling around with your TV settings can help but its better to stick to a small TV for these what it boils down to is are you willing to drop 15 bucks for a month of movies even though you know that the ratios are funny for example
Movies in pack :50
Movies that are not even in the same genre as the pack :2-4
Movies that are unwatchable due to transfers:5-8
Movies so terrible you won't finish them 5-8
Movies that are funny because they are so terrible 10
Decent films 10
Suprisingly good films
this is an average of movie packs and depends on taste of course but you will see my point when you watch them but if you like only a few films youll get your money worth",1223337600,2,1012,4.194871794871795

714367,4,6303690653,"First off, I also own Mill Creeks ""Terror"" collection, which for my money is the better collection to buy.  However, I bought this one first, and while I'm still wodnering how Mill Creek differentiates between ""chilling"" and ""terror"" I can tell you this; the one main difference I see is ERA.  Whilist the ""Terror"" collection features movies mainly from the 1920s - 30s, this collection is almost exclusively 1970s.  That in itself is not a bad thing, because 70s B Films are still good (...by B Film perspectives) but they are a totally different breed than the Atomic Age goofiness of the 1950s/60s or the Victorian 1930s (I'm aware Queen Victoria was dead by then, but the horror films from the 30s all seem to have a rather Victorian style about them).

There's a few totally unwatchable films here (""Oasis of the Zombies"") and there's a few really goofy/ funny ones (the best being future ""Lord of the Rings"" director's ""Bad Taste"").

Its a good collection.  Its well rounded and most of the films are enjoyable for the camp or for riffing.  However, I'm much more of a ""Terror"" guy, I guess.

Thanks be to Mill Creek! These compilations are great!",1214697600,2,1153,4.701492537313433

The Milpitas Monster may be only of interest to those who know of Milpitas personally. I was born & raised in nearby San Jose, California but I have worked in Milpitas for over 15 years. The film began as a high school project for students at Samuel Ayer High School in Milpitas, California. Most of the actors were actual residents. The film begins with a brief, historical introduction of the small town of Milpitas in which we learn that the word ""Milpitas"" means the land of a thousand gardens. However, in later years the Milpitas has gained more reputation for the local dump that litters the ground & air instead of fertile gardens. The Milpitas dump is the premise that leads us to the creation of the monster.

Keeping in mind that this is the first film produced at the high school level (as they claim), the technical effects are limited, but at times quite good for their limited budget. The monster is obviously a man in a rubber suit with a gas mask and large insect wings. There are also stop-animation effects that shows the monster flying and destroying town buildings reminiscent of Harry Hausen stop motion effects. Filmed in the 70's, look at the classic footage for nostalgia reasons. Look at the metal garbage cans the residents have (presently California has plastic garbage containers issued by the city) and check out the vintage ambulance similar to the ""Ghostbusters"" movie. If you live or have lived in Milpitas, you can check out the original city hall (now it has been remodeled), the Dixon Landing Airport (no airport there anymore, but there is still a street called Dixon Landing off of highway 880) and the many acres of Milpitas that were empty fields along Calaveras Blvd (same street as city hall) before they are what they are now.

Sports fans may recognize Crazy George (from San Jose State football games) in the opening introduction doing his MGM lion imitation. Crazy George told me that he was in the film while he was a student/teacher at San Jose State University. Northern Californians may also recognize Bob Wilkins from the ""Creature Feature"" television shows of the 70's. A few years ago I went to a special screening of ""Milpitas Monster"" that was presented by some of the film's creators at the Milpitas library which is where I purchased the DVD. It was pleasant to see some of the film's actors & actresses in attendance. If you ever happen to pass by Milpitas, you can stop by the ""Great Mall of Milpitas"" and see the giant, monster claw that was used as a prop from the film.

As I mentioned before ""The Milpitas Monster"" was a great effort done by young filmmakers in high school and I commend their efforts in making it. People with a connection to the town of Milpitas may want to check this out to see vintage clips of the town, but otherwise I think it might be only of moderate interest to everybody else.",1209945600,2,3043,4.914396887159533

714462,5,6303690653,"I own several of these Mill Creek DVD boxed sets, and I must admit that this one is my favorite. Probably because it has some of the cheesiest and silliest B-movies out there, most of which are very enjoyable.
The movies range from those made in the 60s to the 1980s, with most in color. You get cult classics like Roger Corman's ""A Bucket of Blood"" and Peter Jackson's ""Bad Taste"" to pure schlock like ""Drive-In Massacre"" and ""Horrors of Spider Island"". Then there are those in the ""pretty good"" category, such as ""The Blancheville Monster"", which is heavy on Gothic atmosphere, and ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"", a somewhat bloody slasher flick. Also you get ""The Ghost"", a Barbara Steele flick, and ""Horror Express"" with Christopher Lee.

714466,3,6303690653,"50-Movie packs are definitely a bargain, but this particular set is very uneven. I'm not referring just to the varied conditions of the prints of the movies on these DVDs. I am talking about the actual quality of the films. This one has a higher-than-expected ratio of losers-to-winners.

On the positive side are some amazingly clear prints of ""The Blancheville Horror"" (a European attempt to simulate the Roger Corman Edgar Allen Poe films), ""Werewolf in a Girls' Dormitory"" (a decent early 1960s Italian suspense film), ""Shock"" (in which Vincent Price plays a murderous psychiatrist), the clever horror anthology ""House of the Dead,"" ""The Devil's Hand"" (a Twilight Zone-style film with Robert Alda), ""Horror Express"" (a Lovecraftian horror), ""Snowbeast,"" and ""Messiah of Evil."" The copy of ""Silent Night Bloody Night"" - one of the most effective cult films of the 1970s - is about as good as you can ask for, considering that the original prints of the film started to deteriorate almost immediately.

Unfortunately, ""Deep Red"" - perhaps the best-known film here - has an awful quality print.  It's also odd that some films here are really crime dramas and not suspense or horror. And, even more unfortunately, most of this box set consists of awful prints of awful films released in the late 70s or early 80s and forgotten until now. I can be very forgiving when it comes to B-movies but I found myself stopping way too many movies after the first 15 minutes were up. They were that bad.

So, while the price ratio of watchable movies is definitely in your favor, be prepared to wade through lots of clunkers.",1193788800,8,1613,4.897435897435898
714467,5,6303690653,"I really enjoyed the movies in this collection, they are old and classic but not really scary",1190505600,,93,4.529411764705882
714468,3,6303690653,"I've only watched about half of these films, but half might be enough. This set, like it's companion ""Horror Classics"", is a little less than the packaging and the titles might promise. Don't misunderstand though; it's still worth the low Amazon price for so many movies and hours of campy entertainment, just don't expect a lot of actual chills or fifty scary movies; you'll be disappointed as some of the movies fall more into the mystery or murder catagory.

Whereas ""Horror Classics"" tended towards the black and white B movies of the 40's, 50's, and 60's, this pack leans more towards the color B movies of the 60's, 70's, and 80's. There's a distinct difference. Not being around for those old black and whites, I couldn't tell you if they were meant to be truly scary, but now, they're just charming and intriguing as a terrific glimpse into cinema's past. The movies in this set, on the other hand, seem to take themselves a little more seriously, but fail miserably anyway leaving them neither scary nor charming. They're more often just kind of annoying. And there are a lot more very poorly-dubbed foreign films in this pack as well. There are some definite gems, and again, it's all a matter of taste.

One film in particular that makes this set worth the price is The Legend of Bigfoot. I'm still trying to cope with my mundane life after viewing this film. It plays out like a bad Disney made-for-television live-action wildlife film of the late sixties or early seventies, but it has even less point, a more annoying narrator, and an absolutely unbelievable ending. Most of this rambling 92 minute feature is crammed full of non-sequitur animal and nature shots from which the narrator draws absurd conclusions about the habits and whereabouts of Bigfoot.

At one point in his horribly cost-ineffective quest that takes him from the north, to the south, then back again to the far north of the country, he runs over a squirrel. The next seven minutes of film are spent on the squirrel's little surviving friend dragging him off the road and chewing his head for nuts. When a vulture passes overhead (more random stock footage, no doubt), the little carnivorous survivor scampers off the road and hides. From this drawn-out sequence of rodent on rodent head-eating, the narrator somehow concludes that Bigfoot must also be like the squirrel and withdraw when danger is near (danger apparently being inept aging trackers with crazy theories).

Be sure to stick around when later in the film, the narrator and his wife actually SEE, with their own eyes and a Super8 camera, the bright flashing eyes of Bigfoot on the sparse tundra of the Artic. That or it might just be a 1968 International Scout, I'm not quite sure, but then, neither were they. They ran away. And you definitely won't want to miss the ending when the narrator, mustering all his lifelong tracking abilities, sits perfectly still to be rewarded with not one, but several, coincidentally short Bigfeet all milling about aimlessly in the forest not twenty feet from him and his (apparently) soundless camera. Absolutely startling.

With this kind of solid and obvious proof, I'm quite shocked that, thirty years later, we don't all live hand in hand with our hairy brethren. I've got a spare room. Why doesn't Bigfoot come live with me? Oh, that's right. Because after listening to the narrator jump from one idea to the next, each with more incredulity in his voice than the last, Bigfoot assumes all humans are absolutely inane.

714536,5,6303690653,"My first introduction to these 50 movie packs was the great Horror Classics set, which had older movies from the 20s to the 60s. This one has more titles from the 60s through the 80s. These are more drive-in type movies. We've glot lots of explotation goodness here. The set as a few stink bombs, like House of the Dead and The Cold, but it has more than enough great moives to make it a good deal. Heck, at justa bout 28 cents per movie, you can't gripe too much. Now, when I say it has some great movies, you must be a fan of these kinds of movies in order to get full enjoyment out of them. If you are the kind of person who spent their youth going to the video store on Friday night, renting splatter movies and Italian horror classics, this is for you. If your view of horror begins and ends with Scream and Final Destination, you might be let down.

Some stand outs here are;

Deep Red

Virus

Bad Taste (Peter Jackson's AWESOME first movie)

Messiah of Evil

Funeral Home

Devil Times 5

Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory (sp)

Silent Night Bloodey Night

Lady Frankenstein

Death Rage (not horror, but bad-A** action movie)

If you love renting old, cheasy movies and hate Blockbuster, because they never have the good old stuff, get this set. I don't have Drive-In Classics yet, but it looks good. Also, if you like the older, late night Chiller Theatre type stuff like me, look into the Horror classics set as well. I also have the Sci-Fi set, which looks good, but I haven't watched it. yet.

One world of caution. The titles on these sets seem to change a little, depending on when you get them. The set I have doesn't match exactly the titles listed her on Amazon, which doesn't mach exactly the list ont he company's web site. Most of the titles are the same, but some seem to come and go.",1172361600,11,1799,4.334328358208955
714537,3,6303690653,"There are some definate stinkers in ""Chilling Classics."" However, the low price of this collection, coupled with the good movies (some of which are quite obscure) that are included make up for the dross. Here are my reviews of those films in the collection I award 3.5 Stars or better to.

""A Bucket of Blood""
Starring: Dick Miller, Barboura Morris, Antony Carbone, and Julian Burton
Director: Roger Corman

Walter (Miller), the dorky, put-upon busboy at the beatnik hangout Yellow Door Cafe, wants desperately to be an artist--both so he can impress his beautiful coworker Carla (Morris) and receive the sort of attention and adulations that are heaped nightly upon Maxwell Brock (Burton), a poet who performs regularly at the club. After he accidentially kills his neighbor's cat, he hits upon the perfect medium for his creative expression--he covers dead bodies with clay and presents them as sculptures. Soon, people are dying to his models.

""A Bucket of Blood"" is a dark comedy where a talentless loner, desperate for acceptance, goes to extremes to fit in. Its events and messages can be interperted in many ways--as commentary on what passes for ""art""; as a statement about the downsides of societal pressures to fit in, even among supposedly accepting counter-cultures; that the one constant in life is hypocracy; or perhaps even all of these--or the viewer can just switch off the brain and watch Walter's quest for acknowledgement spin out of control.

The general structure, story, and even the types of characters, of ""A Bucket of Blood"" is similar to Corman's later ""The Little Shop of Horrors"", but the story is more tightly focused, the humor sharper, and the actors' performances more restrained. Where ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" was a broadbased spoof, ""A Bucket of Blood"" keeps its attention on beatniks, artists, and wannabes. The main characters are virtually identical, and they even come to similar final fates, but Walter emerges as a far more sinister and evil character than Seymour, and the climactic moment in ""Bucket"" is more impactful (where it was just goofy in ""Shop"".

The camerawork and lighting of this film are near perfect. Yes, this is a low-buget film, and the sets are simple and shabby, but Corman uses a wide range of filmmaking techniques that heighten the drama and horror toward the end of the film, and they greatly enhance the pitch-black comedy when Walter's boss (Carbone) is reacting in the background while Walter is showing his latest creation to him and Carla, after the boss has realized how the sculptures are being created. In fact, during the chase scene toward the end of the film, I found myself wondering if many modern filmmakers should be forced to watch this movie to see how to properly apply the tools of their trade.

The actors are also universally excellent, with great comedic talent shown all-around, from the pair of doped-out beatniks who wander through the scenes spouting hilarious nonsense; to Carbone, as the demanding boss who finds respect and fear for his busboy; to Morris, Walter's kindhearted coworker and target of his affections; to Burton, as the blowhard, psuedo-intellectual poet; to Miller, who, in his only starring role, puts on a spectacular show as a dork who turns into a homicidal maniac because of a hunger for acceptance. Miller does a fine job of going from goofy to menacing, but still maintaining a comic tone.

""A Bucket of Blood"" is a successful movie by any measure, and I think lovers of black comedy will get a tremendous kick out of it. Personally, I wish I'd seen it sooner, because I suspect it's going to be one of those films I'll be watching once a year or so from now on.

""The Bloody Brood""
Starring: Peter Falk, Jack Betts, Barbara Lord, Robert Christie, and Ron Hartmann
Director: Julian Roffmann

A small-time hood and drug dealer (Falk) becomes enamoured with the beatnik lifestyle and with nihilism. He concocts the murder of a messenger boy, as a sort of performance art piece to show how meaningless life and death are. However, he didn't count on the boy's brother (Betts) who is willing to go to any length to find the killer.

""The Bloody Brood"" is a lowkey crime drama set against the backdrop of beatnik clubs and parties. It's a rare film in that it doesn't paint the counter-culture as inherently corrupt and evil, but instead shows outsiders coming in and ruining it, such as Falk's gangster character Niko, and his spineless partner-in-murder, Francis (Hartmann). Instead, the film shows the true beatniks to be into harmless ""kicks"", and as young people who feel alienated from society, such as Ellie Brook (Lord).

The star of this film is, in every way, Peter Falk. He plays his character with a sense of quiet menace that commands the attention of the viewers. It's easy to see how Niko manages to become the center of the beatnik group--it's not just his money, his access to party-pads, or his ability to spin pop-culture nihilistic philosophical discussions out of the tinnest of logic threads... it's his charisma. And Falk shows a charisma in this role as I've never seen him display in any other role. (And it's not that he is the only good actor in the film--everyone in the cast maes a good account of themselves.)

The film is also well photgraphed, taking full advantage of the black-and-white medium, as well as the beatnik settings. I found it interesting how the only soundtrack present was whatever music might be playing at a club or a party, but that this music still underscored the drama tremendously.

""Deep Red"" (aka ""The Deep Red Hatchet Murders"" and ""The Hatchet Murders"")
Starring: David Hemmings, Daria Nicolodi, and Gabriele Lavia
Director: Dario Argento

Pianist Marcus Daly (Hemmings) witnesses the brutal murder of a famous psychic, and then teams up with Gianna Brezzi, a feisty woman reporter (Nicolodi) to find the killer. Soon, they find themselves stalked by the deadly, seemingly omnicient murderer who is willing to end numerous lives to protect a number of dark secrets.

""Deep Red"" is a detective thriller crossed with a slasherflick (and it's definately one of the precursor films to the slasher genre), with hints of a ghost movie tossed in for good measure. Although it's easy for a movie with so many different genre elements all simmering in the same pot to dissolve into a hideous, gooey mass, director and co-writer Argento manages to stir the many elements into a fabulous goulash of gore, mystery, and plot-twists that are actually suprising to the viewer.

This is far from a perfect movie. It's got some pacing problems--any viewer paying attention will know that a character who is pegged as the killer at one point in the film can't possibly be the killer, and Marcus should realize it too long before he does--and the storyline is unneccesarily muddy at a couple of points, but there are enough chills, gory kills, and well-executed twists to more than make up for these weaknesses. (The thread of Marcus trying to remember some half-seen clue at the crime scene, one that he thinks might unlock the entire mystery, is a great device that keeps the viewer engaged... and the kills scenes will sate any gore-hounds out there.)

""Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon"" (aka ""The Mansion of Madness"")
Starring: Claudio Brook, Arturo Hansel, David Silva, and Monica Serna
Director: Juan Lopez Moctezuma

Gaston (Hansel) visits a remote mental hospital and finds a bizarre place where the chief doctor (Brook) has instituted the very unsual approach to curing mental illnesses described in ""The System of Dr. Tarr.""

""The Mansion of Madness"" is based on one of Edgar Allen Poe's creepiest stories, ""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether"", and unlike so many films supposedly based on Poe's works, the originating story is still at the heart of this film. However, ""The Mansion of Madness"" is far bigger than the story, and far creepier. The insanity that permeates the sprawling mental hospital--which seems to be the size of a small city--and the haunted woods that surrounds it, is felt in every second of the film... and along with that madness is an ever-growing sense of surreal horror and dread.

This is probably one of the creepiest and strangest movies I've ever seen. If you like offbeat, low-key horror movies, I think you'll enjoy this one. (It drags at a couple of places, and Gaston has got to be one of the densest people on the planet that he doesn't realize that something is wrong with the asylum AND his host, but the good far outweighs the bad here.)

""Funeral Home""
Kay Hawtrey, Lesley Donaldson, Dean Garbett, and Barry Morse
Director: William Fruet

Teenaged Heather (Donaldson) goes to spend the summer helping her grandmother (Hawtrey) convert the defunct funeral home once operated by her long-vanished grandfather into a bed-and-breakfast so the old lady can make ends meet. While Heather discovers summer romance in the idyllic small Canadian town, she also discovers dark secrets.

""Funeral Home"" is a thoroughly predictable low-budget horror movie that's part suspense flick and part slasher flick, but which owes more to ""Psycho"" than ""Friday the Thirteenth"". However, the fact that it's crystal clear where the movie is going to end up some 15-20 minutes in--and that it never deviates from its predictable course--is a completely forgiveable flaw due to the great skill with which the movie is paced and filmed, and the all-around decent performances given by the actors, as they portray their mostly likeable characters.

I also greatly appreciated the realistic aspects of this film. It breaks with the long-standing horror film convention that teens are either boozed-up sex-hounds or ultra-shy dorks with no social lives. Heather, Rick (Garbett), and the other teen characters in the film are far closer to what real average teenagers are like, and this helps make the movie seem even creepier when the horror kicks in. With characters painted as more real than is typical in a movie like this, the horror feels that much more realistic. (That said, I don't quite buy the killer and the backdrop for the murders.)

This is no materpiece, but it's got genuine chills and a number of unique aspects that make it worth seeing for those with a keen interest in the horror genre.

""Gothic""
Starring: Gabriel Byrne, Natasha Richardson, Julian Sands, Myriam Cyr, and Timothy Spall
Director: Ken Russell

Eccentric poet Lord Byron (Byrne) invites a young prodigy Percy Shelly and his fiance Mary Wollstonecraft (Sands and Richardson), along with her halfsister Claire Claremont (Cyr) to spend a weekend with him and his personal doctor, Polidori (Spall), at his isolated estate. After an evening of reading ghost stories, drinking wine enhanced with Laudenum (a hallucinagenic), and an impromptu seance, these members of the cream of the Age of Enlightenment's intellectual crop find themselves trapped in an ever worsening spiral of confusion and terror. Is it just the drugs, or did the seance call forth an evil spirit which is now tormenting them?

""Gothic"" is a stylish, extremely creepy movie. There are very few fillms I've seen that manage to transfer the dread and fear felt by the characters as the fillm unfolds to me, but this is one of them. Although it starts out feeling like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?"" set in a rambling castle and performed by effeminate people in puffy shirts and bad hairdos, this movie soon turns into one of the most bizarre and terrifying films I've ever seen. Much of it unfolds seemingly at random, with the threads occassionally coming briefly together but invariably seperating into a chaotic mess again.

While I would usually find this to be a flaw, it is something that works with great effect here.

The film has an odd tone to it from the very first arrival of Shelly and the girls at Byron's estate, and that oddness kicks into fullfledged horror movie mode when the characters start reading ghost stories to each other. At that point, the passage of time, and the very nature of reality, the house, and those in it start to change. As a thunderous rainstorm batters the manor house, Byron, Shelly, Polidori, Mary, and Claire all seem to be drawn into ghost stories, and singly or together, they all experience one of more hallmarks of such tales, ranging from apparent possisions to hallucinations of all kinds.

In fact, while ""Gothic"" is not a movie about a huanted house, it should serve as required viewing for anyone who is thinking about making a haunted house movie. The way the house becomes a character unto itself as the film unfolds, the various torments the character's experience, the possessions... they're all haunted-house standards, and they're all handled with far greater skill than in the vast majority of movies that deal specifically with hauntings.

A great deal of the film's success can be credited to Gabriel Byrne. He gives a wonderfully varied performance as the twisted poet Byron, but he is also portraying the one character who remains stable throughout the fillm. Byron stars out as an unbalanced character--swinging from capricious, to sensitive, to menacingly insane, sometimes all within the space of a few minutes--but as the other characters come increasingly unglued, Byron emerges as the closest thing there is to a stable hold on reality. Whether in the dying light of a spring afternoon, or in the deepest part of a nightmare-made-real, Byrne's Byron is unchanged... and this contributes to the viewer's sense of unease; the abnormal has become the closet thing to normal, anywhere. Byrne, however, is merely a point man for an excellent cast. All the principles are great (Cyr is genuinly creepy after she's possessed (?)), and given the length of some of the shots and the difficulty of the dialogue delivered during them, I don't think this was an easy movie to star in.

Although the amazing use of Byron can also be credited to the script, there are some issues with the script as well--mostly relating to where the line between what's a dream and what's reality in the film is found. However, I may be overcritical on this point, because once ""Gothic"" gets going, the terror and disorientation builds and builds to such a degree that reality and drug-soaked nightmare and which is which really doesn't matter. And the way you can see the works of Mary Wollstonecraft-Shelly and Percy Shelly (and almost certainly also that of Dr. Polidori, although I've not read his book ""The Vampyre"", so I can't say) echoed throughout in dialogue and situations

This film is one scary ride, featuring fine performances from all its actors, and led by a director that deploys every tool in his filmmaking arsenal with great skill and artistry. It's a film worth seeing if you enjoy well-made horror flicks and experimental films. (Oh... and I suppose I should touch on what many reviewers seem to think is a selling point. The film supposedly chronicles the one night that gave rise to Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"", Shelly's best poems, and Polidori's ""The Vampyre"". While this is an interesting aspect of the film--and it's one that raises even more questions about where the line between reality and nightmare exists in the movie, and if perhaps Byron and his guests did, in fact, rouse some evil spirit that night--it's not one that felt was so all-fire important to the movie. It helps to know who the characters are, but one doesn't need a BA in English to ""get it."")

""I Bury the Living""
Starring: Richard Boone, Theodore Bikel, and Peggy Mauer
Director: Albert Band

When Robert Kraft (Boone) takes his turn as chairman of the town's cemetary (a duty that all of the leading citizens eventually end up with), he approaches the job in a blase fashion. What does it matter if he marks vacant (yet spoken-for) grave sites with white pins and occupied graves with black pins on the large map in the chairman's office? Well, it matters a great deal, because Kraft discovers that when he inserts a black pin in a vacant grave, its owner is soon killed so as to make the map accurate.

""I Bury the Living"" is a fabulously atmospheric little horror film that captures the best elements of a Hichcock film and a Rod Serling-scripted episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" Although the script is a bit weak at times--some characters seem to be here for no reason other than someone thought they should be, because they are traditional genre standards, such as the Love Interest and Scoop-Hungry Reporter--the way it and the director manage to evoke a growing sense of dread, and the way the twist ending is set up and implimented are expertly done. I also love the way the map of the cemetary becomes a character unto itself as the film progresses.

This is another one of those overlooked gems that's worth a look by horror fans and mordern filmmakers. Yes, it plays a lot like a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, but it can show all those people out there producing brainless horror movies what can be done with just one room--the best and spookiest parts of the film happens entirely in Kraft's little office on the cemetary grounds.

""Messiah of Evil"" (aka ""Dead Peoiple"" and ""The Second Coming"")
Starring: Marianna Hill, Michael Greer, Joy Bang, and Elisha Cook, Jr.
Director: Willard Hyuck

Arletta (Hill) arrives in the small coastal town where her father dissapeared. She moves into his house while attempting to learn his fate, but finds the locals unwilling to talk to her. She soon meets up with Thom (Greer) who is a collector of modern legends and folk-tales, and of women... and after they learn of the town's gruesome history from a broken-down, crazed drunk (Cook), they discover the town's history is repeating itself: The townsfolk turning into flesh-eating zombies. With this nightmare-curse claim the visitors as well?

""Messiah of Evil"" is a different sort of horror film and a different sort of zombie movie. It's a nightmare-like tale of a small town that's consumed by a curse of a completely unknown (and therefore unstoppable) origin, and as the movie progresses, it becomes more and more dreamlike in its quality. (From the African-American albino and his pick-up truck full of corpses as Arletta is arriving in the doomed town of Point Dune, through Toni (Bang) going to see a movie theater where the marquee reads ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"" and is subsequently surrounded by townie zombies that gradually fill the auditorium around her as she is absorbed by the film, to Thom and Aerletta's final desperate escape attempts, the film is full of hazy symbology and a sense of ever-increasing dread.)

The technical aspects of the film are iffy--the lighting and camerawork and editing all seem a bit on the weak side--but there are plenty of inventive visuals that work on many levels, the staging of the scenes, the sets, and, most importantly, the performances of every actor in the film are top-notch. It is the acting that really clinches the dreamy, nightmarish sense that hovers over the entire film. This is horror movie that needs the vieweer's attention to work, but it also rewards the viewer plenty who gives it.

""Messiah of Evil"" is one of those films that for whatever reason has fallen into obscurity and which is one those wonderful surprises that lurk inside those massive DVD movie packs, like ""Chilling Classics"", which is where I discovered it. It's the sort of movie that makes such sets worth buying, and that makes up for some of the other offerings included. In fact, ""Messiah of Evil"" would be deserving of an 8-rating, if not for the fact that it takes the dreamlike quality that its creators managed to imbue it with just a little too far. I don't necssarily need a story to be wrapped up nicely at the end, but I don't want to have a sense that the filmmakers didn't really know themselves what the source of the evil in the movie was, or perhaps even how to effectively end their movie. At the end of this one, I felt that a little of both might well have been the case.

However, the not-quite-pulled-off end of this film isn't as damaging to the overall experience as it often is. Everything leading up to it is so well done that this film is one of several good reasons for spending money on the ""Chilling Classics"" 50-movie pack.

Well, I just finished watching the first disc and I am SO glad I did! I am very happy with the sound and picture quality - it's not perfect, but light-years ahead of some budget DVD's. Though I've only seen four films, one of them was an old grainy B&W voodoo flick, and I understood every word.

This film was called ""I Eat Your Flesh"", and I liked it due to it's surreal charm (If you like films like Robot Monster and The Creeping Terror, you'll like this too). The 'special effects' are hilarious but it's still a spooky film to see late at night with the lights off. The music really captivated me - it was music you'd expect to hear at an Italian airport in the 1960's.

Another film, ""Memorial Valley Massacre"", was what you might call ""god-awful"", but it did have a strange charm to it... I laughed and groaned at a few scenes, but the next day I remembered it rather fondly - it moved along quite well and certainly lived up to it's title... It's set in Memorial Valley and it certainly was a massacre. The best scene is when the 'dog' comes into the teens tent.

I'm certainly going to buy every other 50-movie pack (the ones that aren't filled with overly-edited films, that is) - I'm most looking forward to getting Suspense Classics, Horror Classics, and Martial Arts Classics (the reviews for that one convinced me there's a lot of fun to be had with that set).

""Horror Express"" is another favorite I've seen many times, but on this set the picture is murkier than it was when we were watching it back in the '70s, when our family TV used a single antenna, long before we had cable!

This box set even inlcludes old classic Black and White horror flicks to Gory Exploitation films that are a rare find! Yes it all sounds too good to be true! Here's the catch the movies have decent audio but VHS quality picture thats not too bad. For those Widescreen people, these movies are all in Fullscreen. And also, for some of the films that are inlcuded like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste, I have a feeling some of these movies were edited;but still wat a great deal this is!",1150588800,9,623,4.426086956521739
714752,5,6303690653,"I have a particular fondness for what might be referred to as 'public domain material'; films/TV shows that are either un-licensable or not currently licensed & pretty much fair game for anyone to do what they like with. And I must say that for the dollar cost these 50 Movie Packs by Mill Creek & Treeline Films are usually worth taking a gamble on -- for about $.50 cents a movie you are bound to find something worth watching more than once, and this box set is probably their best collection to date.

There literally is something for everyone on here: Giant rampaging monster movies (MILPITAS MONSTER, TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST), cult Euro horror (WITCHES MOUNTAIN, THE BLANCHILLE MONSTER), urban slashers (DRILLER KILLER, DRIVE-IN MASSACRE), 80s teen oriented trash (DEADTIME STORIES, FUNERAL HOME, MEMORIAL VALLEY MASSACRE), a classic Euro crime/revenge thriller (DEATH RAGE), some genuine classics from American horror (SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT, MESSIAH OF EVIL), even some stuff completely out of left field that sort of defy description (HORROR OF SPIDER ISLAND, REVENGE OF DR. X, PANIC, THE COLD) and will command multiple viewings. Something which cannot be said of say, the new KING KONG DVD. Heck, you even get Mr. Jackson's BAD TASTE, an aptly named film that is ten times more imaginative, clever and endearing even if a bit primative compared to what his computer programmers can whip up. Anyone else had enough of that junk? Well here are 50 movies that don't use any CGI and some are actually very well made, even if the DVDs aren't.

And while the print quality is uniformly poor -- most are old fullframe home video or television prints -- the content is so diverse and some of it so utterly obscure that they sort of transcend the ""bargain bin"" nature of the collection and makes the box set a very rewarding investment for those who like to see stuff that might be a bit more obscure than what you can find on Netflix: This box set marks the first ever DVD pressing of WITCHES MOUNTAIN, the 85 minute print of SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT is the most complete version currently described (most run 83 minutes, including the old VHS versions), nobody else seems to have TRACK OF THE MOONBEAST or THE MILPITAS MONSTER, and who can resist stuff like THE REVENGE OF DR. X, DEADTIME STORIES (with all of the nudity, sleaze & gore), DRIVE-IN MASSACRE and Alfonse Brescia's WAR OF THE ROBOTS?

One other thought, which is that these sets kind of represent the future of this medium of public domain collections. The packaging is bare-bones, two movies per side on 12 double sided DVDs, cardboard sleeves for the discs inside of a larger carton, and so much material to sample & choose from that if a movie stinks, let it. Just move on to another title and let fate take you where it will. For $.50 cents apiece the movies are allowed to stink and the DVD transfers be somewhat sub-par: The collection very easily pays for itself just by being so darn watchable. I highly recommend taking a chance, and Mill Creek did a wonderful follow up with their '5O DRIVE-IN CLASSICS' collection too. Someone working there knows what they are doing.",1145232000,119,3149,4.753199268738574
714753,4,6303690653,"Some of the transfers in this set aren't great, but you know what?

This box set is equivalent to finding 50 movies at a yard sale for about .50 cents apiece! It doesn't matter what the movie quality is like, at this point, it's a steal!

Some friends and I watched 'Memorial Valley Massacre' together and had a great time. In fact, I laughed more watching that film than I have during some 'comedies' distributed by Hollywood recently...

And if you don't have a copy of Bad Taste (good VHS-like transfer by the way) and Dario Argento's Deep Red in your collection, snag this set now!",1143072000,10,585,4.5

714758,5,6303690653,"Here's another great collection of public domain movies! Don't expect perfect, mint versions. These are movies that are available (although, some are not available anywhere else but this set) in a zillion different versions from tons of companies at ridiculously ranging prices! Why pay for packaging?? THE CHILLING 50 MOVIE PACK is for mature audiences as it contains lots of blood and nudity. Here's the rundown: DEATH RAGE- Yul Brynner (West World) is a retired hitman who returns to his trade in order to find the man who murdered his brother. This one also has a beautiful blonde stripper in it! MEMORIAL VALLEY MASSACRE- A wildman is preying on a group of hideously annoying campers. You'll cheer him on! Watch for the wet T-shirt dance in the rainstorm! MEDUSA- George Hamilton (Love At First Bite) is a crazy guy who owes a loan shark (Cameron Mitchell) a lot of money. Someone even crazier than George is killing people! Not bad. DEADTIME STORIES- A good old fashioned horror anthology loosely based on fairy tales. I like this one! SCREAM BLOODY MURDER- A madman goes on a killing spree in this completely bonkers gore flick! Very bloody and disturbing! Don't let granny or the tikes watch! THE BELL FROM HELL- A man is released from an asylum and gets a job at a slaughterhouse. This one's gruesome, with a TEXAS CHAINSAW vibe at the end! METAMORPHOSIS- A decent monster flick up until the silly finale. I suggest skipping the last 5 minutes or so. NAKED MASSACRE- Another shocker like SCREAM BLOODY MURDER! NAKED MASSACRE takes the Richard Speck case and moves it from Chicago to Belfast Ireland! The killer is a sadistic, remorseless rapist. I hate rape scenes, and this one's got 'em! Originally titled BORN FOR HELL (a nod to Speck's ""Born To Raise Hell"" tattoo), I would definitely keep granny far from this one too! HAUNTS- May Britt is a lonely woman who lives on a farm. Her small town is plagued by a stalking murderer. Is it her weird uncle (Cameron Mitchell)? I like this one, though it runs a bit long at the end. CHRISTMAS EVIL- The classic yuletide murder and mayhem film! Brandon Maggart is a guy who works at a toy factory. He snaps around Christmas time, dresses as Saint Nick, and checks that list! DRILLER KILLER- Abel Ferrara is a struggling artist with a problem. He lives with two gorgeous babes in an apartment. Unfortunately, a loud, obnoxious punk band just moved in directly beneath them! Sleep deprivation drives our hero nuts. He buys an electrical outlet belt he sees on TV, plugs in his drill, and goes on nightly hunting trips through times square! Bloody and twisted! Watch for the gal-pal shower scene! HORROR EXPRESS- Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are scientific rivals who must team up to defeat an alien being that boils people's brains in their skulls! Telly Savalas makes an appearance near the end. Very good! THE SNAKE PEOPLE- Boris Karloff stars in this voodoo epic with zombies, cannibal women, and the ever-lovely Tongalele dancing her way into our hearts! Oh yeah! SISTERS OF DEATH- A girl is accidentally killed in a sorority hazing ritual. Years later, the gals who were there are summoned to a ""reunion"". They arrive at the big mansion, surrounded by a 10-foot electric fence, and actually stay! Brainless! Still, not too awful. WAR OF THE ROBOTS- An italian space opera with goofy guys in even goofier outfits as ""robots"". Dumb but fun. OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES- Not exactly Romero or Fulci, yet has a certain charm. Some college kids set out to find a treasure of WWII gold, guarded by nazi zombies! OK. THE WITCHES' MOUNTAIN- This one's stone-cold-boring! I barely made it to the finish! A photogragher and a girl he just met venture into the mountains where nothing really happens! Witches play a small role indeed! The ending is good, but hardly worth the misery of the rest of the movie! DEEP RED- Argento's classic! Don't expect anamorphic treatment! A man witnesses a murder and simply must solve it. Lots of twists and cool death scenes! THE REVENGE OF DOCTOR X- Written by Ed Wood, it's too bad he didn't direct this dull pile of ofal! A mad scientist sets out to prove that man evolved from plant-life (!). He succeeds in creating a plant man with venus flytrap feet! I kid you not! BAD TASTE- Yep, Peter Jackson's first movie! Jackson made this in his spare time with family and friends! It's a gore masterpiece! Cannibalistic aliens try to turn earth into a free-range farm for human meat! Can Jackson and his cohorts save us? Yepper! VIRUS- Glenn Ford is the president as the world is wiped out by a super-flu bug! Only an arctic outpost remains uninfected. Doom and gloom abound! THE MILPITAS MONSTER- Horrid. However, it was acually made by highschool students! So, worth at least a peak. FUNERAL HOME- A fairly good PSYCHO-type flick. A woman goes to live w/ her grandma in a renovated funeral parlor, now a bed and breakfast! Death ensues. LADY FRANKENSTEIN- The drop-dead gorgeous daughter of Frankenstein decides to make her own creature, using the brain of dad's assistant in the hunky bod of the groundskeeper! Nudity ensues! SILENT NIGHT, BLOODY NIGHT- Another holiday murder flick! A madman escapes from the bin just in time to cause panic in a small town. Nice twist ending and gallons of blood! PANIC- Another mad scientist turns himself into a murderous monster on the loose! Edited and flat! MESSIAH OF EVIL- One of my favorite movies! A woman trying to find her father is drawn into a zombie holocaust! The scenes in the grocery store and movie theatre are unforgettable! Elisha Cook jr. (House On Haunted Hill), Royal Dano, and Anitra Ford (Invasion Of The Bee Girls / Graveyard Tramps) are memorable. THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER- There's a monster loose in an old castle! ok. CATHY'S CURSE- A little girl is possessed by her evil, vengeful aunt! Extremely low-budget schlocker that has many high points, like the creepy doll! THE ALPHA INCIDENT- A deadly viral weapon is unleashed at a train depot in hillbilly land! Dull to the point of causing amnesia! THE DEMONS OF LUDLOW- A haunted piano attempts to destroy a town. ""Demons"" in frilly clothes murder people. Yikes! THE COLD- Quite possibly,the worst movie ever made! AKA: THE GAME, this flaming pile of dogfudge is about 3 old gazillionaires who give people money to spend a week in their ""hauted"" resort. It tries to be funny, but fails badly. HANDS OF A STRANGER- A famous pianist loses his hands in an accident. A brilliant surgeon replaces the hands w/ those of a murdered gangster. This sends the piano-man into a murdering rampage! Watch for Sally Kellerman (M*A*S*H) in a tiny role. GOTHIC- Lord Byron throws a bash with Mary Shelly and company. They all get stoned on laudnum, causing a night of hallucinatory horrors! Ken Russell's at his whacked-out best! MAN IN THE ATTIC- Jack Palance takes a room in a quiet London boarding house. Is he the notorious Ripper? I like this one too! THE DEMON- A vile, seemingly faceless killer is stalking victims! Can psychic Cameron Mitchell help catch him? Violence and nudity throughout. CRYPT OF THE LIVING DEAD- Watch out! The queen of the vampires is awake! She's beautiful and can turn into a wolf! Andrew Prine is the man who unleashes her and must try and stop her! Pretty good. TRACK OF THE MOONBEAST- A guy gets hit in the head by a meteor and turns into a lizardman! Pretty stupid! THE GHOST- Barbara Steele plots to kill her husband, only to be double-crossed! Ms. Steele is always grrrreat! JESSE JAMES MEETS FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER- Frankenstein's daughter sets up shop in the old west! Following the family tradition, she must create a monster. Enter Cal Bolder as Frank Clayton, a musclebound gunslinger and side-kick of Jesse James! He soon becomes a mindless slave! This movie could easily have been 30-45 minutes shorter without losing any ""suspense"". DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON- A man visits an insane asylum to observe the doctor's new method of treating patients, only to find that the patients have taken over the asylum! ok. THE BLOODY BROOD- My copy had GOD TOLD ME TO instead. People are commiting mass murder with their only explanation being the title phrase! Excellent! HOUSE OF THE DEAD- Another horror anthology! 3 stories told in a mortuary! good. SLASHED DREAMS- Robert Englund plays a gentle, nice guy in this silly, new-agey, ""feelings"" movie! Don't let the title fool you! There's a rape scene, but ths is NOT a revenge flick! Yuck! A BUCKET OF BLOOD- Dick Miller is a busboy in a beatnick coffeehouse. He stumbles into a career as an artist after covering a dead cat in clay. Let's just say that he needs bigger subjects for his art! A Corman classic! HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND- Scantilly clad babes run around screaming a lot! Oh yeah! THE LEGEND OF BIGFOOT- Like watching a home movie! Endless narration and nature scenes! Boredom incarnate! THE DEVIL'S HAND- Loopy devil-worshippers gather new people through visions and voodoo-dolls! Silly but fun. I BURY THE LIVING- Richard Boone works at a cemetery where a mystical bulletin board has the power of life and death! Good. DRIVE-IN MASSACRE- A sword-wielding maniac slaughters patrons at a drive-in theatre. Pretty gory for it's day! ok. Well, there you have it folks! This collection's a keeper! The price is unbeatable!... BEWARE: Later editions of this collection tend to add and subtract titles (this is a common practice in the ""public domain"" world).

Yet I still give it three stars  Really 3 & 1/2 if I may.
There's a quirky sense of humor at work here that I cannot dismiss. They got the late Paul Frees to do the narration for this thing and that sucked me in.

Rocky & Bullwinkle, The Haunted Mansion, and so much more. Who DOESN'T love Paul Frees?

7853543,4,6303690653,"50 Chilling Classics is another one of those mega-movie packs typically found for dirt cheap.  Ive seen the set offered for less than $15 at times. That averages out to not much more than a quarter per movie! So even if you find movies in the set you don't like (which Im sure will happen) its hard to feel ripped off at those prices - assuming you can find some movies you do like, that is.

This is quantity over quality, though. At roughly $0.25 per movie you get what you pay for. There is no restoration of audio or video and no extras of any kind. So if you're anal about quality then you might as well not even bother with this set. But then whos to say that if you spend $15 on some of these movies by themselves you're really getting enough quality improvement to be worth $14.75? There are at least a few titles herein that have no better buying option available. I sometimes use cheap sets like this as a sort of sampler, finding those rare movie gems then finding higher quality editions.

These huge collections tend to be public domain movies (many of which can be obtained legally for free with some time and diligence). In some cases such as the 50 Horror Classics pack they tend to be public domain because of their age but are often very good movies.  In the case of Chilling Classics they tend to be public domain more because they weren't worth the effort of keeping up with the rights.

Don't get me wrong, there are some movies in this set worth seeing. I found some I would consider to be gems. However, while some are good none are 5* level, and many stink like a convenience store bathroom.

What kind of movies will you get? Some of these are monster movies, some thrillers, some more along the lines of drama with sci-fi or horror tropes, some mob movies that wouldn't fit into the horror or thriller genres at all. One is actually a documentary rather than a movie. Some are old black-and-white while others are more contemporary. Several are dubbed foreign movies which, as best as I can tell (since they don't actually specify), represent Spanish, French, and Japanese cinema.

Something to watch out for is the movie list. There are different editions of the collection with slightly different movies included. The one Ive seen the most comments on is Deadtime Stories. This is missing from the more recent editions of the set (word is that they realized this wasn't a public domain movie and had to pull it from the set as a result). Ive seen a Christmas movie listed in past editions (dont remember the exact title) thats not in my set, and have heard of other discrepancies. (UPDATE: Ive recently confirmed that the new editions of the set do have some changes from the one I have - most notably Peter Jacksons Bad Taste as well as a couple of other titles have been replaced.) So I guess my best advice is to either buy the set in a store where you can examine the exact movie list you're getting before making the purchase, or don't get your heart set on owning any one particular title because theres a chance you might not get it.

The questionable content here ranges quite a bit with some movies rated G and some most definitely R. There is plenty of sex, nudity, rape, incest, violence, gore, strong language, drug use, etc. Some moves are appropriate for younger audiences, but the set as a whole is not at all kid friendly.

Ive had my set a while so the packaging has changed I do believe. Mine is a big box with a velcro flap which holds the discs in their individual cardboard sleeves. Its comprised of 12 double-sided discs. Most have 2 movies per side though some have more. The cardboard sleeves have movie summaries and a few basic details. This has most likely been updated to a plastic box with paper sleeves.

Mill Creek used to put their logo watermarks on their movies. I hope whoever thought this was a good idea got fired because its annoying. Fortunately, I only noticed it one or two times in this set (though unfortunately one of the best titles is one of the ones so marked) so it won't affect my rating.

MOVIE LIST:
Here are the movies in my edition of the set with some brief comments. Ill try to get around to posting full reviews of each movie sometime soon. (UPDATE: In case you missed the earlier notes, the current movie list is different from mine with at least 3 or 4 changes including Bad Taste. Since the list will probably change again and Im not familiar with any of the new titles I won't try to keep my list updated. Just keep your eyes out for those differences if you get interested in any particular title.)

-The Alpha Incident: Some people at a remote train station are infected by an alien virus.  They have to stay awake or die while scientists hunt for a cure.  Mostly drama with sci-fi tinges, it's decent but not great.

-Bad Taste: Peter Jackson's first production, a low budget, homemade flick.  Aliens are wanting to turn humans into the next intergalactic fast food craze, and a makeshift commando group is resisting them. It's mostly just a mindless gore fest with plenty of sick comedy.

-A Bell from Hell: A young man has been released from a mental institution and plots revenge on his aunt and cousins for putting him there. A thriller that goes in unexpected directions this one has promise and good moments but doesn't deliver as a whole.

-The Blancheville Monster: A girl's family has been told that a curse plaguing them will lift if she dies before her next birthday. Either the monster roaming the grounds or an inexplicable illness will surely get the job done but not if her friends have anything to say about it. It's a decent movie of suspense and mystery.

-The Bloody Brood: A drug dealer peddling to beatniks gets a power trip by watching people die. When he orchestrates a murder the brother of the victim comes looking for the culprit. It's not a bad offering though it is beatnik overload. Peter Falk stars.

-A Bucket of Blood: Dick Miller plays a nobody who wants desperately to fit in with the cool beatnik crowd. He begins turning living beings into sculptures. His work is a hit, but of course no one realizes the secret to his success. How far will he go to stay on top? It's a pretty good dark comedy if you can overlook some logistical problems.

-Cathys Curse: A little girl is possessed by the spirit of her dead aunt. She begins lashing out at others and driving Cathy's mother insane. It's a bore of a movie.

-The Cold: A group of bored rich folks invite a number of people to take part in a game of fear that will leave the winner rich. But is the game lethal for the losers? Not worth watching, the plot unravels and is unsatisfying.

-Crypt of the Living Dead: A grieving son unwittingly releases a 700 year old vampire from her prison tomb. As she wreaks havoc on a small island village the man responsible for her release must find a way to stop her and the cult that would serve her to save the woman he loves. Its a pretty enjoyable but poor quality vampire flick.

-Death Rage: A retired hitman comes back to the job when information about his brothers murderer comes to light. This is an unimpressive mob movie. Its Yul Brynners last starring role.

-Deep Red: When a psychic is murdered her neighbor catches a glimpse of it and sets out to catch the killer. Aided and hindered by a pretty reporter the pianist/would-be gumshoe searches for clues in his scattered memory. It's not an awful movie, but it is forgettable probably due to several cuts made to the original film.

-The Demon: This one follows two intertwined stories that don't feel properly connected. One is about a kidnap victim whose parents call in a psychic to help. His revelations only result in tragedy. The other is about two cousins one of whom is dating a rich playboy and one of whom is being stalked. It's a dull and unimpressive flick.

-The Demons of Ludlow: The spirit of a man mistreated by the town he founded resides in a piano presented to the townsfolk as a gift generations after the founder's death. The spirit begins taking lethal revenge on the descendants of the people that wronged him. Not worth watching.

-Devil Times 5: 5 criminally insane children are unleashed upon an isolated cabin full of people to be used for murderous amusement. It's a disturbingly creepy and fairly well done film - one of my favorites in this set.

-The Devils Hand: A seemingly happy man turns from his normal life to the pleasures of a dark cult. Can he realize what he has given up or will the cult be the death of him? It's an interesting and dark tale of carnal pleasures vs. good sense.

-Dr. Tarrs Torture Dungeon: Based on Edgar Allan Poes work this one is about a reporter who is writing a story about the peculiar treatments used at a sanatorium which he visits. He soon learns that the place has been overtaken by the inmates. Trapped, he and a few others must find a way to escape the walls built to keep lunatics inside. While interesting at times I wasn't very impressed. There are better adaptations of this story on film.

-The Driller Killer: A struggling artists flips his lid and goes on a killing spree with a power drill. It's a string of pointless scenes intermingled with lots of shots of a performing band that isn't much good.

-Drive-In Massacre: A sword-wielding maniac is slicing people up as they watch movies in a drive-in theater. Two cops investigate the crimes questioning ex-carnies, bullying bosses, and peeping toms. Is it anger, lunacy, or perversion that is leading the killer to do his bloody deeds? Is any movie patron safe? It tries some interesting tactics but isn't all that good a movie.

-Funeral Home: A one-time funeral home is now being turned into a bed and breakfast by the wife of the mortician who mysteriously vanished into thin air some years before. It seems that disappearances are disturbingly common around this area. The granddaughter of the owner home comes to town to help the new establishment get off the ground, but when more people begin disappearing she can't help but be curious about what's going on. That's going to get her into a world of trouble. This is one of the best movies in the set. I enjoyed it a lot.

-The Ghost: The wife of a wealthy, crippled man and her young doctor lover plot to kill the older man, but when he's out of the way his wealth isn't where it's supposed to be. The secret lovers begin scouring the estate for the missing jewels, but strange things are happening. The ghost of the murdered man wants vengeance. This one is borderline decent; mostly my complaint is that it just takes too long to get to the ghostly part of the story.

-Gothic: This is the tale of the real-life night Mary Shelley came up with the idea for Frankenstein. It is a fictional tale despite using characters based on real people. It's a disjointed romp through a dark house during a storm with little rhyme or reason. Julian Sands and Natasha Richardson star.

-Hands of a Stranger: A pianist loses his hands in an accident and is given those of a dead mystery man. He starts losing his mind leaving people dead in his wake. It's right on the verge of being enjoyable with a weak premise holding it back.

-Haunts: A killer terrorizes a small town, and a lonely farm girl is particularly traumatized. The trauma doesn't end with the cessation of the killings, either; there's more going on here. A fairly decent movie  nothing great but not a complete waste of time.

-Horror Express: An archaeologist has found what he thinks is the missing evolutionary link between humans and primates. As he's transporting it on a train, this fossil comes to life and start killing people. Some think it's the devil, others think there's something more natural going on here. The two professionals join forces with an investigator and other train passengers to try to figure out what's going on and stop the killing. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing star with a small role for Telly Sevalas. Despite the strong actors the movie is not very good.

-Horrors of Spider Island: A plane carrying a group of dancers on the way to a show crashes on a remote island. The manager of the group is bitten by a weird spider and begins mutating into a monster. As the girls are tormented by the murderous man-beast they think they have found rescue in a group of mining researchers, but they might not last long enough to get away. This is a really, really bad movie.

-The House of the Dead: A man lost in the city is brought in by a kindly mortician who shows him 4 coffins and tells him 4 stories about the occupants: a stalked teacher, a videotaping serial killer, a couple of feuding detectives, and a tortured man. Some of the stories here are good, but others not so much. Some of the performances are surprisingly good.

-I Bury The Living: The director of a cemetery learns that if he places a marker on the map the owner of that plot dies. As people try to convince him it's nonsense they lead him to kill more and more people. Wracked with guilt and questioning his sanity the poor man tries to figure out what he should do even to the point of calling the cops on himself. Yet he can't seem to simply stop putting the markers on the map. It may sound goofy, but it's actually a pretty decent movie.

-I Eat Your Skin: A playboy writer is sent to a remote island full of voodoo rituals. Bad luck and zombie maniacs create danger for the writer and his friends as he tries to save a pretty girl living there from a cult that wants her for a sacrifice. She is refusing to leave because of her father so the writer must stick around to play hero. This is an unimpressive effort on all fronts.

-Jesse James Meets Frankensteins Daughter: Gunslinger Jesse James takes his injured friend to a doctor for help. This doctor is part of the Frankenstein family and is hiding out in the old west to continue their legacy of questionable experiments on humans. It becomes gunslinger vs. mad scientist and her monsters. While very campy I enjoyed it a lot.

-Lady Frankenstein: When Frankenstein succeeds in creating a monster which kills him, his daughter takes up the mantle. According to her she wants to create a monster that can stop the killer (mostly to save face for her father's reputation), but her motives and methods are questionable. I didn't like anything about this movie. It's a weak story poorly executed.

-The Legend of Bigfoot: This is a supposed documentary about a wilderness tracker who becomes convinced of the existence of Bigfoot and tracks the beast across the continent finally capturing footage of the creature in the wild.  It's perhaps mildly interesting if you're into Bigfoot legends or wildlife footage (low quality as it may be).

-Man in the Attic: In the midst of Jack the Ripper attacks in London a strange man takes up residence in a room and board place, only he prefers the attic to his room. Some are suspicious of him while others think he's being unfairly judged just because he's a bit odd. It's an OK flick but with a lack of closure for most of the characters. Jack Palance is the man in the attic.

-Medusa: A brother and sister used to a life of wealth and ease find out they are in danger of losing their inheritance. They set out to save their lifestyle by any means necessary including murder. But who is the victim and who is the culprit? It's a poorly paced nothing of a movie. Don't bother. It's mostly just an hour and a half of George Hamilton on screen.

-Memorial Valley Massacre: People are being murdered in a newly opened camp ground. The park ranger refuses to close the area due to secret, dark personal ties to the place. It's a mostly mindless slasher flick with an unusual culprit.

-Messiah of Evil: This one revolves around a young woman who travels to a rinky dink town to find her father who cut off communications mysteriously. She is walking into a nightmare as she reads about her fathers descent into madness, a madness that seems to have affected the whole area diving them to cannibalistic tendencies. Her only companions are a trio of strangers who have been shunned by the townsfolk. It's a strange but artistic film with good and poor aspects. Check it out if you enjoy HP Lovecraft.

-Metamorphosis: This story centers around a geneticist who thinks he is on the verge of cracking the secret of aging in the body. When squeezed for results he tries the experiment on himself before it's actually ready. The results lead the scientist to carry out violent deeds without memory of them. As his body continues to change he must find a cure before it's too late, but his fellow scientists are blocking his lab access. It has some OK moments of suspense but is mostly unimpressive especially the shocking end.

-Naked Massacre: A man with a serious hangup over women holds a group of young nurses hostage as he abuses and kills them. It's a disturbing movie made more so because of connections to a real-life story.

-Oasis of the Zombies: Zombie Nazis guard a lost treasure in a remote desert oasis. When a group of treasure hunters sets out to find it they are set after by the undead guardians. It manages to be entertaining just by being extremely campy but is not worth the effort for anyone looking for a serious movie.

-Panic: A lab accident turns a scientist into a murderous monster. A detective and a lab assistant set out to stop him. It's mind-numbingly dull.

-The Revenge of Dr. X: A NASA scientist on vacation creates a plant man that likes to kill people. It's really, really bad.

-Scream Bloody Murder: Matthew has a hangup about men touching women which leads him to kill even his own father. When he reaches his teen years he befriends a prostitute whom he torments. It's mildly interesting.

-Silent Night Bloody Night: A string of murders one Christmas are somehow tied to an empty house and its past secrets. Is the new owner a crazed psychopath or a victim like everyone else? It has some interesting ideas but doesn't deliver at all.

-Sisters of Death: Members of a sorority are lured to a reunion helmed by the father of a girl who died in an initiation of theirs. Is he out for lethal revenge? The living try to figure out what's going on as they one by one drop dead. It's a mildly entertaining flick with a satisfying ending.

-Slashed Dreams: Jenny and her new boyfriend go on a wilderness hike to find a hermit friend of theirs. They are tormented by a gang of hillbillies. There's very little suspense and too many musical montages. A young Robert Englund has a small role.

-The Snake People: Spanish soldiers and an innocent girl cross paths with a voodoo society. One of Boris Karloff's final films and not his shining moment.

-Track of the Moon Beast: A man mutates into a lizard monster and kills people.  Can his friends find a cure for him before he kills the woman he loves? It's not terrible but is mostly unimpressive.

-Virus: A doomsday virus has all but wiped out human life on the planet. Only an Antarctic outpost and a few isolated groups survive. Continued survival is the next challenge especially when automated defense systems set in place by the  world's governments threaten to finish the job of annihilation. It's a fair effort with several fairly big-name actors, but it suffers from being too broad in scope and slow-paced.

-War of the Robots: A scientist and a girl are kidnapped off a space station by aliens. The fate of the installation and the alien race hang in the balance.  Not worth watching.

-Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory: A werewolf is killing people at a girls' school. Some think the new teacher with the shady past is using the monster story to cover up his own misdeeds, but he claims to be trying to cure the wolf disease. It's not very good.

-The Witchs Mountain: A photographer and his spur-of-the-moment love interest take a trip to the mountains where they are lured to an ancient village apparently inhabited by witches. It has some creepy moments which give it potential but the plot is too convoluted to be interesting.",1496016000,,20034,4.560011138958507

7853545,2,6303690653,"I'm not sure what all these reviews are for, surely Amazon has cross referenced reviews for sereval different products. This is a review for the Amazon video version of the milpitas monster. I've tried to watch this movie before, in its alternate title/cut, but couldn't stand to continue watching due to bad video and audio quality. This version is much, much better in both departments. A closed captioning option is included as well (though some of text actually reads ""inaudible""). The film is still dark and the audio still sounds distant but you can't expect too much. The acting is really bad. The monster is surely not good but still better than any fan made suitmation I've seen. Glad they were able to use real service vehicles. The worst part is even at it's short run time, it still feels very drawn out. Though it is nice to see a stateside giant monster movie that's not King Kong. Also, the monster uses Rodan roar from Toho's Godzilla series for some reason.",1490832000,,974,4.701754385964913
