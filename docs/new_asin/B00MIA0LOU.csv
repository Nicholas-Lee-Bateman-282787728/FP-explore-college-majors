8672558,4,B00MIA0LOU,"This is an interesting set of films. However, the first film film, despite its Freudian title, is not a horror film. I wonder why they would package such an unusual film in a package labeled Japanese Horror Films unless they figured that they could not find another category for such a surrealistic work of art. Maybe they figured that it would not attract audiences if sold alone, in Japan or in the rest of the world. That said,  A SNAKE OF JUNE is an excellent film, far superior to the other two: PRAY (actually called PRAYER during the film's titles) and VITAL. SNAKE is filled in blue-tinted monochrome (back and white) and contains some fairly erotic scenes, even though sexual coupling does not occur until the end. Our heroine is a mousy, conservative office waif who gets in touch with her inner sexual feelings and transforms into a pixie-like sophisticated woman wearing the shortest miniskirt imaginable. All of this is because of a mysterious voice on the phone that wants to play Henry Higgins. One eerie scene that almost reminds me of Felini is when unknown men are peering through funnel-like viewing devices.

PRAY(ER) is a ghost story featuring a little kidnapped girl who may not be real. Much of the male character's tragic back story does not make sense until the end when the pieces come together. Then we are reminded of the British film THE HAUNTED starring Aidan Quinn. As a bonus, we also have another ghost girl who is much more menacing, particularly to the male character's  friends who have actually been plotting against him all along. If you like films that are brain twisters, you should find no complaints with this one.

VITAL interested me the least, the story of a long-haired med student suffering from amnesia because of an auto accident that killed his girl friend Ryoko. His memory starts to return when he discovers that the cadaver that he and another med student are dissecting is actually Ryoko, who wanted to dedicate her body to science. Boy, did she! Talk about unlikely coincidence. There are several sequences with our hero and Ryoko that may be dreams or may be his interacting with her as a ghost. You tell me.",1473379200,,2164,4.762666666666667
