1336690,1,B000042OIY,"This disc should have been a wonderful record of the world's celebrations as I remembered watching on TV. Instead I have a God-awful piece of trash that looks like it was edited on New Year's Day by someone still hungover.  Never has so much wonderful source material been mangled, butchered, and  just plain disrespected! This disc should have been done with at least some  eye to future generations. A real downer. Avoid at all costs!",948758400,23,436,4.786666666666667
1336691,1,B000042OIY,"I knew it would happen one day.  I just bought a DVD with a giant logo covering the content that I paid good money to see.  This CNN piece of trash is that DVD.
I don't plan on buying any more CNN DVDs!",948672000,12,202,3.6744186046511627
1336692,1,B000042OIY,"I was expecting all cities to be shown...not just the few that they did.  Where was Boston, Toronto, etc...  Then they split DC and NYC!  Just awful.  The graphics covered too much of the screen of what they did show, and we  could live without the CNN logo in the corner!  Hope somebody else does it  right!",948499200,5,308,4.298245614035087
1336693,1,B000042OIY,"Actually, I wanted to give this 0 stars!
I expected more from CNN - but as I listened to Larry King read off a bunch of credits for the first five minutes I knew that this video was going to be just a rehash of the  original broadcast.  I was expecting pictures without the CNN  ""bug"" in the corner and dull commentary.  We got poorly edited  segments of festivities that should have been shown in full and long drawn  out segments of stuff that should have been edited down.  For example:  With all the pyro that was going off around the globe, why did we have to  suffer 3 whole minutes of various shots of the Hollywood sign all lit up  with blue flashing lights?  Overall, this DVD sucks.  Let's hope that ABC  has done a better job with their video.",948412800,11,754,4.26241134751773
1336694,1,B000042OIY,"I just got finished reading some of the other negative reviews when my copy arrived in the mail. I started watching with a positive attitude saying, ""how bad could it really be."" We'd all seen at least some  of the coverage on TV and it was ok. Well, let me say this... it was THAT  bad. (I won't even get into the sound and video quality as other reviewers  did) Some of the irrelevant commentary from the live broadcast that you'd  surely think they would have edited out... they included. Then left out  important footage such as: North America's first (St. John's Newfoundland)  and Other noteables like: Miami, Chicago, Toronto, Seattle, etc. One of the  most impressive fireworks displays (Paris) got hacked to pieces. The best  examples of the lunacy are the arguments of who's party is better  Washington or New York, and the part in the NY subway where we witness a  millennium milestone - drunk teenagers screaming as some poor girl gets  made a fool of by a reporter. I was expecting something more of a  documentary type production with narrative commentary and music over the  amazing video images, but instead we got bits and pieces of the live video  feeds awkwardly spliced together and poorly edited. There isn't even any  kind of notes or booklet inside. I really feel embarassed for CNN. This is  very unprofessional and quite frankly a waste of money. Let me say in  closing that as soon as one of the more reputable TV networks comes out  with their own video, this useless piece of plastic will adorn the bottom  of my trash can. I'm very disappointed.",948240000,58,1574,4.678832116788321
1336695,3,B000042OIY,"This is not as good as I expected!  A lot of celebration has been cut off.  And there are a lot of degradation in screen quality!  I remember when I watch the celebration live on CNN thru my cable, the live cast is sharper  than what is shown on the DVD!  (I thought DVD is better quality!)
It  is a good DVD to keep and has a good content, but the quality is a bit low.",948153600,,370,3.8026315789473686
1336696,2,B000042OIY,"First of all, the program was only 1 hr. 14 min. long. Secondly, instead of fully showing most of the cities, they kept the ""live"" format, jumping from place to place. Naturally, except for the occasional split  screen, only ONE place can be shown live at midnight. The others show  ongoing, post-midnight celebrations. I'll wait for someones presentations  of each city in it's fullest, thank you.",948067200,54,398,5.0
1336697,5,B000042OIY,"Wansnt millenium eve a great night? Well it was for me, and it is a great way to see how other people celebrated around the world. It was a truly forgettable night, and this DVD is the perfect way to show others how it  was, and remember yourselves!",947548800,,249,4.1875
1336728,1,B000042OIY,"This DVD could have been a lot better. For a start, the picture quality is terrible, like it's been taped straight off the TV.
The programme has been badly researched - take for example Jean Michel Jarre's concert at the  Great Pyramids of Egypt. It's described as 'Gene Michael Jarrey's' concert  and they read comments from an earlier press release.
As for the camera  work, let's take the pyramids again: it's dark, grainy and you can't even  see what's going on the stage let alone the lights on the pyramids. Instead  of paying to tap into Mike Mansfield's video feed they obviously decided  that a VHS camcorder 2 miles away would suffice!
Avoid. Get the book  ""A moment in Time"" instead if you want to remember that night!",961200000,2,729,4.6484375
1336729,1,B000042OIY,"I was soooo looking forward to seeing the ""best of"" year 2000's fireworks celebrations on video. I am so deeply disappointed I can't believe it. I feel that CNN has ripped us off with a video that is a waste of my time and money. Except for Sydney, WHERE THE ( )ARE THE FIREWORKS?  Mostly I get to listen to their stupid reporters TALKING about them. CNN, I  did NOT want to see your talking heads!  I didn't nearly get enough of the  Eiffel Tower on new year's eve, and for my fifteen bucks I now get even  LESS! And I remember London having a big display, didn't they? Split  screens were almost as bad as no screens at all. Time was wasted on local  rituals on pacific islands. How many times will most people want to relive  the Pope doing his thing? And trying to capture the celebrations ""in  time"" is a ridiculous idea for such a video. What a sorry piece of  work. I could do so much better, it is pathetic. Please, CNN, call me and I  will do the work for FREE...",955756800,2,972,4.172043010752688
1336730,1,B000042OIY,"CNN has really embarrassed itself with the release of this Millennium 2000 video.  After several years of hype, the coming of the year 2000 came and went with few problems, and with a world-wide celebration that was  underwhelming.
The plans for this video release were laid out before the  actual event, and in this instance, CNN can hardly be blamed for the fact  that nothing of note happened *anywhere* during the celebrations.
The  video feels like (and is) nothing more than a crass attempt to cash in on a  very transient fad.  It's very similar to the cash-in videos that many news  organizations churned out at the end of the Gulf War, and about as useless.  There is no focus upon any individual area of the world, to put the local  celebrations into context.  Meaningless imagery that blends together into a  bland homgenous whole is all that this video provides.  If you stayed  inside and didn't watch television at all during the 1999/2000 New Year,  then perhaps this video might fill some minor part of your life.  Otherwise, it's a poor replacement for a celebration, and should be avoided  by anyone who wants to retain a happy memory of the New Year.",952128000,9,1169,4.707920792079208
1336731,3,B000042OIY,"This is the only video currently on the market on Millennium celebrations. Whether you like it or not. But if you want to own a video of Millennium celebrations then this has to do. The picture quality wasn't it's best. The  whole video ran only 90 minutes even though the tape box said the running  time was 120 minutes. There were a lot of split screens whenever CNN had to  cover more than one city at once. Some cities were missing like the  fireworks coming out of the Seattle space needle. Not all 24 time zones  were included. Only about 17 time zones. We go from London, England at 7 PM  EST right to Rio at 11 PM EST. The celebrations in the time zones during  the hours of 8, 9, 10 PM and 4 AM EST were cut out. Lot of Sydney's  fireworks display was included. It was the longest segement on the video.  There was only 45 seconds of footage of the ball dropping in Times Square.  But they showed a lot of the confetti and pyrotechnics that followed  afterward. It shared a screen with Washington D.C. So this video is in the  middle. Not too great but not too lousy either. I give it just an OK  rating. I hope a video comes out on Times Square compiling all the 24  hourly celebrations. That would make a good item. They could also include  some behind the scene footage on the puppets and the special effects.",951868800,13,1321,4.270161290322581
1336732,1,B000042OIY,"Dont buy this dvd ..... is horrible , you can see the Cnn logo in all the video , just 2 minutes of each country ? ... the Pictury is really bad and the sound sucks , the only good thing of the dvd is the last part that have  a kind of video clip . But don't buy this dvd for that. waste your money in  others things. And the editorial review says that has the celebration in  Buenos Aires .... well .... i don't know what they think when they say  Buenos Aires. But i didn't see it in the dvd.
A really BAD Dvd .........",951782400,2,521,3.7962962962962963
1336733,1,B000042OIY,this is the worst dvd i have ever seen. save ur money. they show 1 second of footage for each city and sound is horrible along with resolution. does anyone know where i can get the abc 2000 version of the millenium on tape  or dvd? if so e-mail me.,950745600,,248,3.96
1336734,1,B000042OIY,"Poorly done DVD, CNN! You had a great opportunity to rehash the events of midnight, but blew it. Example 1: Midnight hit Paris, Berlin, and Rome at the same time. When CNN covered this live, they had to do a lot of  split-screens and 'squeeze' shots. I bought this video for the specific  reason of getting CNN's re-edited version, ie. let's show all the Paris  footage, THEN show Berlin, THEN show Rome. No, they did not do that.  Instead, they just replayed their off-the-screen footage! What's up with  that?
 Example 2: In London, the fireworks lasted for >>18  minutes<<. The DVD shows Big Ben striking midnight, and as soon as  the chimes stop, CNN cuts to the announcer saying ""Yes, in case you  were wondering, that WAS the largest fireworks display EVER.""  Unfortunately, CNN cut 17 minutes out! Why bother telling us it was the  largest display ever if you cut it out!
  Overall, I am thoroughly  disgusted with the editing. Also, I agree with the others who point out  that the video is NOT DVD quality. I *knew* I should have shoved a tape  into my VCR back on Dec 31st!",950572800,14,1082,4.557291666666667
1336735,3,B000042OIY,"I thought this DVD was good. I enjoyed watching the huge fireworks displays on this video. It does cover every time zone here on Earth. Although this video is short. But, I bought this video so I can show my  kids & grandkids in the future that I got to witness the Millennium. I  think you people should do the same. Because this will be the last time  you'll get to see a Millennium. Remember that!",949708800,3,400,4.2368421052631575
1336736,2,B000042OIY,"This DVD is an example of how one should NOT be done.  The video quality is on the level of VHS, or even worse, something taped straight off the air with a bad antenna.  The menu is very simplistic and the whole disc seems  to have been rushed out in order to cash in on the millenium memorabilla  craze.  I would have expected better from CNN, being the ""world news  leader"".  The footage could have been remastered and cleaned up and  more time could have been spent polishing it. Buy this disk if you  absolutely have to own a record of the Y2K New Year's celebrations.",949622400,27,572,4.320754716981132
1336737,2,B000042OIY,"This is basically a timezone-by-timezone view of the Millenium celebrations at major cities around the world, as shown on CNN that day. At each countdown the major cities are shown together so you can see how each one celebrated at the same time. Video quality about the same as broadcast TV. Audio quality not great. No extra stuff. But you knew it would be this way.  Consider it a souvenier and move on.",948844800,,406,4.561643835616438

7919620,3,B000042OIY,"I thought I was the only one to have problems with the audio since I played it on my second laptop while working on the computer. I was happy to see New York City's twin towers in the background even for just a second. To me, the New York City skyline have never been the same. The cities like Sydney, Paris, Las Vegas, and others welcomed in the millennium with fireworks and more.

I wished the sound quality was better though since I could barely hear the audio on my laptop. Still the overview of the millennium celebration was one for the record books. I will probably keep this DVD anyway.",1474156800,,595,4.36036036036036
7919621,2,B000042OIY,The videos at the different World locations where not sharp. I thought with modern equipment HD and Blu ray the quality would be better.,1440892800,,136,4.708333333333333

7919623,5,B000042OIY,This CNN Millennium 2000 DVD is a nice quick over view of some mportant events for years 1900 to 2000.,1390780800,,102,4.15
7919624,5,B000042OIY,"had the vidio, needed the dvd, again great memories, i bought the video in 2001 on a trip in Feb. to the cnn studio, we

7919625,1,B000042OIY,"This could have been good, if attention had been paid to the transfer to DVD format.  The fireworks look more like indistinguishable blobs of light even on a TV... on a progressive scan computer monitor or hi-res TV, forget it.  Don't waste your money if you want to see sharp, clear fireworks & images... clearly this presentation was thrown together with no thought at all.  Maybe you taped something off cable on new years eve, 2000... if so, what you have almost certainly looks better than this, so see if you can get it digitized.",1013558400,4,536,4.621052631578947
7919626,1,B000042OIY,"I hope you see this!.. I wanted to find out if you could make me copies of your 5 video tapes, and what you would charge me.  I wish I had been prepared to do this. I don't see your email address, so please let me know if we can make some kind of an arrangement, I would be happy. Thank you lynda@ptd.net",979084800,,304,3.8253968253968256
7919627,3,B000042OIY,"It is a DVD to own, maybe see again in a few years, and relive these moments all over again. As other viewers mentioned though, the quality is not top, many interesting towns are missing (like Saigon, where I was), and  in some instances four cities were on the split screens: HELLO, we are not  live anymore! I won't mind seeing Washington in full size after seeing NY.  No need to put them together at the same time and have to squint.  Plus, I  thought President Clinton's speech was really good and would have liked to  see it on the DVD...
It could have been much much better, but it is the  only one available: it is the monopoly law.",962323200,4,640,4.283333333333333
7919628,3,B000042OIY,"Try not to expect quality in terms of picture or sound quality out of this DVD because it has been made to be adequate for a news. Also all of the shorts were done at midnight, most of you can see is light. However this is  a good record of world's large event, in 24 time zones, lots of country. It  is my year 2000 souvinir.",961200000,,326,3.9242424242424243
