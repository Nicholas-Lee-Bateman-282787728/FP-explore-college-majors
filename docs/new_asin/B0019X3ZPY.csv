8275535,4,B0019X3ZPY,"""Simoun"" ends in a dazzling drama near the end, but the hanging storyline may leave some yuri fans a little disappointed.

The producers pulled off excellent character development near the end, resolving the conflicts between Kaim and Alty. Paraietta learns to settle her romance with Neviril as a friendship. And Aeru and Neviril are definitely in love.

The war looks like it will end, but the Argentum soldiers cut off the sybyllaes' access to the Simoun aircraft. These Simoun were created to allow the sybyllae to head to a peaceful alternate dimension.

In an incredible about-face, the Plumbum priests arrive to lend Aeru and Neviril a Simoun. Together, they perform the Emerald Ri Majon formation to transport themselves to the alternate dimension.

Whether Neviril and Aeru changed the world, however, remains to be proven. The last episode is a mix of images of the Simoun pilots years later. They appear to be in the alternate dimension, but they are also contemplating what happened to Neviril and Aeru. The last scene focuses on Aeru and Neviril dancing in the delapidated remains of the Tempus Spatium.

There's no question that ""Simoun"" has one of the best storylines of the anime in 2008. It is one of the underrated series of the year. However, I still wished that the backgrounds looked richer and the characters looked less cute. Somehow, I was missing something in the designs of the characters. A similar series based on flying aircraft, ""Last Exile"" looked far more amazing, with complex aircraft designs and characters that looked much more real.

Still, yuri fans should look into purchasing ""Simoun."" They'll have a tough time finding a better action series than this.",1223596800,,1693,5.0285714285714285
8275536,5,B0019X3ZPY,"Sometimes, the worst part of a choice is the time before the decision is made. The doubts, the waffling, the feeling of ""what if?""

In Simoun Volume 5, all the choices are made, the cards are dealt and the fate of not only the Sibylla of Chor Tempest, but all the people whose lives touched theirs, is decided.

I don't think I breathed once while watching this volume.

There are many people who did not enjoy Simoun. It was non-linear. There were giant holes in the construct of the world in which the Sibylla lived (although if you like your worlds tidy, I can't *imagine* that there's too much anime that suits you. Maddening inconsistency is about the only constant.) We never really learn the answers to a lot of our questions.

Honestly, I can't imagine caring a damn about any of that. This series has beautiful art (with the exception of Nevril's sex-doll mouth,) amazing characters, fantastic music, a terrific plot.

If Simoun was too hard to follow or just annoying to you, I won't try and convince you to watch it. But there is *no* doubt in my mind, that this will be the best Yuri Anime once again this year for me on Okazu.",1221696000,2,1139,4.483091787439614
8275537,3,B0019X3ZPY,"While initially the series presented itself with some great innovative ideas to push it past the `just another yuri series' hump, the staff failed to reach the point where this series could be sold to a general audience. Simoun succeeds in telling a story from start to finish that will give different audience members different things. What they never quite fail to deliver on is a strong story in a believable world. For a yuri series, Simoun is a series that is much better than anyone thought it would be. For a drama, romance or sci-fi series however, Simoun never found a way to tap into its inner potential. While I'm not sad to see the series end, I don't regret watching it.

  While the payoff is greatly disproportionate to what amount of time it took to get there, the series could be worth a single run through for those who are looking for an above average yuri series. But the odds of it getting a replay or making it into my personal collection are slim.",1220486400,,970,4.5
