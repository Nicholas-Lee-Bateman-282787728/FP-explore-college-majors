4492484,4,B004X7I7A6,"I am a very big fan of the Beachbody workouts and have done P90X, P90X Plus and Insanity.  I was both excited and terrified for this workout as it looked very difficult.  Shaun T, the trainer, noted that if you can't do Insanity's Max Interval Circuit with some level of accomplishment you should not progress to this workout and he is telling the truth.  This workout is NOT for beginners, it is fashioned on sports performance and, as such, has some very difficult moves.  The workout arrived with several aids, a pair of strength bands, an agility ladder and a speed rope.  You will also need dumbbells and/or a pull up bar.  Although some reviewers said the workout takes a lot of room, I found that I could easily modify the workout to do it in my living room.  I did not use the pull up bar but used dumbbells instead (I have Bowflex Selectec ones).  Also I ended up not using the speed rope as it made me nervous to spin the thing in such a cramped space.  These modifications are mentioned in the program and are not an issue.  My green strength band broke before the end of the series and I notice that this is a common complaint.

The workouts are broken up into Speed and Agility, Strength, Vertical Plyo, Back to Core, Relief and something called Game Day.  With the exception of  Back to Core and Relief, which I found to be a little easy, the workouts were quite difficult to master and required both practice and conditioning.  Speed and Agility and Vertical Plyo require you to do a number of cardio/resistance moves in and out of the agility ladder.  You go very quickly and Shaun pretty much yells at you the entire workout.  I can do most of the Insanity workouts all the way through without taking a break and i needed multiple breaks to keep my heart rate from going too high.  The Strength workout is a killer, where you do a number of difficult resistance/cardio moves at a quick pace.  Game Day is an hour of multiple cardio and resistance drills combined to keep you moving and your heart rate up;  I burned 960 calories in this workout alone.

To summarize, if you can do Insanity or P90X all the way through and want to feel like you never worked out a day in your life, this workout is for you.  But be aware that this is designed to kick your butt; Shaun T will never tell you it's ok to take a break, he'll tell you if you take a break you fail!  You will need to be accomplished at push ups and pull ups and have good core strength to progress.  If you finish they'll send you a t-shirt (I have mine) and you will have earned it!  Like many of the other reviewers I noticed that after doing this workout the others (even Insanity) didn't seem so hard.  That should give you an idea what you are in for with Asylum.",1309132800,25,2745,4.324853228962818
4492485,5,B004X7I7A6,"A few months ago, I was getting bored with my usual routine. I was in great shape, but wanted to go to a new level of fitness and muscle tone. I tried Insanity and it worked. I made it to my ideal weight and finally achieved the muscle tone I wanted, even in my abs. However, because I started in such great shape, I was always modifying Insanity (doubling up, etc.) to get more of a workout. I needed something even crazier. I needed Asylum.

I never thought I'd say ""Insanity is easy."" However, it's true...if I add the words ""compared to Asylum."" Asylum is truly taking the Insanity program and philosophy to the next level. Designed as a sports training program, it focuses primarily on agility, speed, strength, and jumping. The interval training of Insanity is modified slightly. The exercises change frequently (and rapidly), but the breaks are nearly non-existent.

Simply put, Asylum is difficult. Physically, it's doable, but brutal. Even the warm-ups are on the same level of the tougher parts of the original Insanity. Not only is the program physically grueling, but the exercises themselves are more technically advanced. In the beginning, I had to pause and rewind the DVDs just to get an idea of how to properly execute the techniques.

The basic Asylum package comes with the DVDs, a floor ladder, and a jump rope. Both pieces of equipment are integral to this program. The floor ladder is especially helpful and will lead to great strides in fitness and agility. It could also lead to increased cursing and growling, since it kicks your butt that much. The use of a chin-up bar and dumbbells or resistance bands is optional, but I would recommend them to get your best workout.

The background music is decent and Shaun T and the fitness models are great for motivation. In fact, the nicer, encouraging Shaun T of Insanity has largely given way to a ""bad cop"" image as he acts more like a sports coach. For example, he often calls out the fitness models for lack of effort! Asylum is truly the next level, so be prepared to be treated like part of the elite (no excuses, no sympathy).

Asylum includes six workouts (Speed and Agility, Vertical Plyo, Relief, Strength, Game Day, and Back to Core) as well as Shaun T's nutrition plan. A ten minute Overtime workout and an Athletic Performance Assessment are bonuses. Another cool feature about Asylum is the calendar. It features the 30 day Asylum program as well as an Asylum/Insanity and Asylum/P90x hybrid program (both 30 days). This makes Asylum more versatile and even more of a value for Beachbody fans.

I do have two minor issues with Asylum (not complaints, really). First, it requires a good deal of space to properly execute. My living room, which was fine for Insanity, is inadequate for Asylum. Shaun T has ladder, jump rope, and bands all laid out and quickly moves from one to another. I have to pause the DVD to move equipment out of the way. Second, I don't believe Asylum Deluxe is worth the price. I found a chin-up bar and bands at WalMart (and on Amazon) for much less cost.

Overall, I love Asylum, and, like Insanity, it's some of the best money I've ever spent on a fitness product, and that includes years of gym memberships. Insanity and Asylum have changed my life and taken my fitness and body to levels I never thought possible. For the first time, I can't wait to go out to the beach in the summer and show off. If you buy one fitness product this year, make it Insanity. Then, when you master that and want to dig even deeper, buy Asylum.",1306195200,82,3536,4.629984051036683
4492486,5,B004X7I7A6,"Insanity: The Asylum is the ""sequel"" to Insanity, and it pushes you hard, further, deeper in ways that the original Insanity workout wasn't meant to do.  I'm going to discuss what to expect in this DVD series, then tell you a little about my results.  To give you some perspective, I'm almost 40, and only 2.5 months ago, weighed more than I ever had before (222 pounds).  I'm pretty short, so I looked like a man-dumpling.  I did insanity (all 63 days, never missed a workout), lost 22 pounds, and then was looking for the next thing to help me keep losing.  Fortune struck, and this set came out at just the right time.  I segued directly into this series.  Here's the story.

The DVD set iself comes with six DVD's, which includes I think 8 videos (the Fit Test, Speed and Agility, Strength, Vertical Plyo, Back to Core, Game Day, Overtime, and Relief).  It also comes with a nifty wall calendar which I gleefully mark off each day (it tells you what to do each day).  It also has schedules for how to combine it with Insanity and how to combine it with p90X for those who have completely lost their marbles and wish to push themselves to olympic like levels.  It comes with a ""speed rope""--really, just a jump rope, an ""agility ladder""--a ladder like contraption made of sturdy plastic rungs and nylon cords.  More on it later.  My set came with two elastic resistance bands (a red, heavy duty one for legs, and a green, still strong but not quite as resistant one for arms and back).  I'm not sure if they all come with these bands, I've heard some folks didn't get them, so check out the package contents carefully when you buy.  It's not like you couldn't get a couple of resistance bands for a few bucks, however, so this shouldn't dissuade you from anything. It comes with a booklet containing a simple but quality nutrition plan--nothing flashy, just good solid time tested nutrition with some suggestions on how to eat to get the best results.  I'm doing weight watchers, so I didn't use their directions, but looking at the nutrition plan, it looks like something I could do if I wanted.  I'm just happy with my WW results.  Neither here not there. The packaging is quite professional, and the quality of the production is high.  Music is much the same as in Insanity--it gets the blood pumping, but you're not gonna want to listen to it in the car.

The workouts are crazy, no lie.  This set was designed for use by folks who have completed a course like Insanity, P90X, Turbofire, or the like.  If you are in good shape, you'll be fine even if you haven't done that.  If you are overweight, like me, beware--this thing is nuts.  It should be handled with care and treated with respect.  These workouts will push you, challenge you.  There are a lot of things that I STILL can't do after completing Insanity!  But by the same token, if you are up for a challenge, there is nothing here that you can't modify down to your own level.  Obviously, don't do these if you are injured, or have heart issues, or all that jazz. You know what you can and can't do.  But if you are basically healthy but just overweight, these DVD's are tools--use them to push yourself, to make yourself stronger, faster, harder, better.  Heaven knows that I freely modify things so that I can do them--but I keep pushing, trying to get closer and closer to what Shaun T. and his insane posse of fitness gazelles are doing.

The Agility ladder is used as a tool to give you a physical goal during your ""in and out abs"", ""mountainclimbers"", and a series of running/agility exercises.  It didn't seem like a big deal at first, but let me tell you, it is a very effective tool and a cruel master.  What the insanity folks do with an Agility ladder blows my mind.  The speed rope is just a light weight jump rope--a little too light weight for me. I use a heavier rope, or use an imaginary rope.  I'm just not coordinated enough to get my heart rate up really high when I'm using the jump rope--I keep tangling my legs up, stopping, and then losing my momentum.  I am getting better, but I usually end up dropping the rope and just keep on jumping in time with Shaun.  It serves my purposes, but if you are really interested in becoming more coordinated and precise with your movements, the jump rope is a great tool.  Asylum also wants you to use a chin up bar, but if you don't have one, it gives you alternative movements.  You need some dumbbells or some resistance bands in order to do the strength workout.  These can be purchased relatively inexpensively if you don't have them, and are a good fitness investment anyway.

Results?  Well I'm 15 days in now (it is a 30 day program).  Remember that I was down 22 pounds at the end of insanity.  I'm down 28 pounds now, and I'm gaining a lot of muscle at the same time.  I've got biceps, triceps, and chest muscles that I never knew I had.  My abs, which had started to show a little during Insanity, are continuing to become more apparent.  I'm still overweight, but definitely getting better.  My cardiovascular status has actually improved since Insanity, which is saying something.  The workouts are unrelenting, about 45 minutes in length each, and they strive to use your whole body.  There is still Shaun's overarching focus on your core, but he works your back a lot, which is new.  I've got back muscles which I had no idea I'd ever have.  I'm enjoying the new emphasis on muscle development (Insanity itself was almost exclusively cardio work), and Shaun is all business here. He is here to ""train you hard, and he is not playing!""  That said, these workouts are also amazingly fun.  The ""game day"" workout is one of the most fun workouts I ahve ever completed, and I look forward to doing it even though it completely shreds me to pieces.

In summary, I love this set.  I love how hard it pushes me, I look forward to working out, I'm losing weight and gaining muscle.  I highly recommend it to the highly motivated--but know what you are in for when you begin.  You will be sweating, panting, groaning, and staring with amazement that ""that was just the warm up!"".  But it will be worth it.  Oh yes, it will be worth it.

**Update**
OK, a couple of things here.  I'm done with Asylum for my first run through about a week ago.  It was super hard, super fantastic, and really really exhausting.  I gleefully took a few days off to fish with some friends, and then came back to start p90x for the first time.  I had been told that I might not find the cardio in p90x satisfying after insanity/asylum.  I figured that it would be fine and planned to just do p90x straight.  Well, they were right, I was wrong.  I realized just how special a program Insanity and Asylum are after I did ""the mother of all p90x workouts--plyometrics"" to paraphrase Tony Horton.  p90x plyometrics is a great workout, but it didn't have the intensity that I wanted.  So I have started the p90x Asylum hybrid.  I know, crazy.  I can't believe I was a fat lump sitting on the couch 3 months and a bit ago.  Now, I'm less fat, less of a lump, and turning into a cardio and workout junkie.  It feels great.  It is simply fantastic.

**Update**
I just wanted to give a little update on how things were going with the Asylum/p90x hybrid.  I love it.  I'm now 38.5 pounds down from when I began.  I am following the asylum/p90x hybrid plan but have extended it to a 90 day plan just using the included calendar as a template.  I am in smaller clothes than I have been in years, which is gratifying, but what is even better is that I look good in the clothes!  I'm getting muscular development where I had no hope of seeing it.  My arms are bigger.  My tire is disappearing.  I still have a long way to go--but ultimately, I'm only just past my 4th month of working out--2 months of insanity, a month of asylum, and a month and a week or so into the p90x/asylum hybrid.  I feel great.  I feel more confident in myself.  When I walk around, I feel strong.  I'm not scared to take off my shirt--not because I look great with it off (yet:-) but because I know I am making positive steps towards my own health.  It's good.  Don't be scared, folks, if you are thinking of getting in shape.  All the excuses we have all used--it is hard, it takes too much time, I don't like to exercise, I have kids, I'm too busy--I've used them all.  And I have 3 kids, a full time job, a wife that I adore, and lots of hobbies.  But I feel great.  The time is worth it.  You can do insanity month one in 40 minutes.  Same for asylum.  You can do this.  You can do this!",1305504000,608,8565,4.3901973265436025

I am in pretty good shape and have been exercising consistently for 6 years but when I got this dvd set it was a like I just started working out again.  New moves were introduced in this program that I haven't seen before and I sweat buckets every time. I absolutely love the workouts.

One word of warning here:  DO NOT buy the Deluxe Version for 2x the price -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/INSANITY-The-ASYLUM-Deluxe-Kit-30-day-DVD-Workout/dp/B004X81ZXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">INSANITY: The ASYLUM Deluxe Kit - 30-day DVD Workout</a>

I ordered it because I wanted the equipment that came with it so thats what I got.  However, I totally overpaid as I found out and returned them after one of the strength bands broke the first time I used it!

You are basically paying $100 EXTRA for 3 strength bands, one resistance band, and a pull up bar when you get the deluxe package.  The bands are really cheaply made.  The chin up bars look fine but it comes unassembled and luckily I didn't put it together before deciding to return everything.

So here is what I did to save a significant amount of cash.  First I ordered the 30 day program through my sister-in-law who is a Beach Body Coach and gave me her discount which was 25%.  Why I did not think of her before, I have no idea!  But even without that discount I still saved literally $50 by just getting the extra equipment on amazon separately;

1. I ordered a set of 3 longer and thicker strength bands for 20 bucks.  I'm half way through 30 days and these are working out perfectly fine.  I highly recommend getting these because they are longer (makes it so much easier to do the workouts) and wider (makes them stronger, more durable I suppose) than just about every other band set I researched and this time around yes I did my research <: 0

2. I ordered my own chin up bar for under 15 dollars.  This one doesn't need to be assembled, put one bracker in each wall and it goes up easily after that.  It's perfect!

3. Lastly I ordered a set of resistance bands with handles.  Not the same exact one that came with the deluxe version but usable all the same.  much better actually in my opinion because you have different resistance levels to choose from instead of just one.

4492519,4,B004X7I7A6,"I started this about a week ago after finishing Insanity. I am really enjoying it because it's good to change things up after two months of Insanity, but it kind of feels like a step down in intensity over the second month of Insanity. Don't get me wrong, it has some intense circuits, but it doesn't seem to keep my heart rate up like Insanity did. Plus, the videos are shorter. It feels a bit like I am taking a break. Like I said, I am about a week in, so I haven't yet done Game Day. I am guessing that it is intense, but it is only done a few times over the course of the program. Maybe I need to do the overtime video after all of the workouts.

A few of the moves that I like so far are the lateral agility ladder jumps (you jump the length of your agility latter sideways), the one legged power jumps, and the one where you pop up from a push up and land in the agility ladder with your feet in the same spot your hands were in when you did the push up (I couldn't think of a shorter way to explain it.) It was a refreshing change of pace to start using weights in the Strength workout...I am enjoying all of the equipment so far.

I would still recommend this workout. It is quite fun so far.",1393200000,,1201,4.0

4492524,5,B004X7I7A6,"If you thought Insanity was tough, here comes another over the top workout created by Shaun T. This time there is no predictable 30 second rest period after 3 or 4 minutes of pushing yourself. The rest periods are far and infrequent and short. The workouts are tougher, more exhausting and because of the use of the ladder, you have to be precise even when tired.  You do not need a jump rope. I found myself getting tangled up when performing some of the fancier moves. I simulate the jump roping by using a pair of jump rope handles. This way I keep moving instead of having to reset when the rope gets tangled on my feet. Shaun T is also tougher and less merciful in the Asylum. He barks at you like a Drill Sgt. minus the foul language. In the Insanity, he encourages you to take a break when your form goes south or are just plain tired. NOT IN THE ASYLUM!!

Some of the killer routines not witnessed in the Insanity are the progressive mountain climbers, progressive in and out abs, mountain climber switch kicks, the bear crawl, the shoulder taps while moving laterally, and more. The Asylum is truly the sequel to the Insanity. If you are looking for a new challenge, get the Asylum. I also own the Asylum part 2, but I have yet to try that.",1392422400,2,1249,4.356223175965665
4492525,4,B004X7I7A6,"I loved Asylum those first few weeks: these were truly challenging workouts that integrated cardio, strength, core, and flexibility.  But as the novelty work off, I realized that while a multidimensional workout held a certain appeal, routines that focused on only one or two elements seemed more effective.  Insanitys cardio was more intense, P90X and my free weight routines worked my muscles more, and Yoga and Pilates better stretched and strengthened my body.  Eventually, Asylum ended up being an occasional workout that I used as a change of pace, and then it was only to use two or at most three of the six disks.  Thats not a good value for the money.

Asylum is still a great total body workout for those who like combining strength with cardio.  It just wasn't the right workout for me.",1392249600,8,797,4.781021897810219

4492535,5,B004X7I7A6,"Insanity: the Asylum is Beachbody's excellent sequel to the successful Insanity workout program.  All the caveats related to that program apply here, and then some: it's not for workout beginners, not for folks with back or neck problems, not for people whose workout space is vertically limited (even more so in Asylum), not for people that aren't completely dedicated to following the calendar.  If you're not in these categories, it's hard to imagine the program not having some effect, both in your physique and in your confidence.

The workouts are hard.  Three of them (Speed and Agility, Vertical Plyo and GameDay) are significantly greater cardiovascular challenges than the ""Max Interval"" workouts in Insanity.  The exercises are also somewhat more complicated to perform, though not especially.  The Strength and Back to Core workouts are difficult also, though they left me less winded.  In any event, unless you have completely mastered Insanity or are a veteran of military-style fitness, you will be challenged by the program.  Shaun T gives fewer breaks and expects better performance in this program; he remains very charismatic but for whatever reason seems a bit ticked off here.  The effect is a sort of boot camp feeling (though if you haven't been through a real basic training program don't fool yourself into thinking you're getting the real deal either).

But the rewards, for me, were substantial.  The most noticeable difference in effect was the continued, and increasing, level of ""good"" muscle soreness throughout the 30 day program.  Whereas in the 60 day Insanity sequence the level of muscle fatigue decreased after the first week of each month-long phase, Asylum is more demanding of targeted muscle groups.  The result is a more cut look.  The fact is you need to be in pretty decent shape to begin with; Shaun expects you to be able to handle the massive cardio load while taking on a greater amount of muscle fatigue.  This comes with its share of sacrifice but it's apparent within a week that this is a whole different animal and will leave you in very good physical shape.

Drawbacks?  The included jumprope is pretty lousy.  Trying to do the Strength routine with the resistance bands is difficult to pull off; you're better off investing in some dumbbells, which are probably more effective anyway.  Don't worry about it too much if you don't have a chin-up apparatus because Shaun has plenty of substitute exercises (I didn't have one). Finally the Core to Back workout will be better if you have the ankle resistance bands (sold separately).

I commend Beachbody for producing a product like this.  It takes nerve to be so demanding of your own consumer.  The program is absolutely uncompromising.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to achieve a high level of fitness without spending a large amount of time and money at a gym.",1378771200,5,2879,4.976987447698745

4492543,3,B004X7I7A6,"I am an insanity grad, and I LOVED the program and my results. I lost 20 lbs and I did insanity several times!

Im kind of disappointed with this series.

- do not purchase this if you have a small apartment/ limited space to work out. I have a large bedroom with slanted ceilings and barely have enough space for the jump rope and ladder. You need at LEAST 6 feet for the ladder because you are jumping in/around it.

- im a poorly coordinated individual. the jump rope workouts are confusing and take a few times to pick up.

-""Core"" and ""Relief"" and ""Back""- I skip these all together. I don't have time to follow this schedule everday, so I average about 3-4 days of workouts a week. I do not need ""relief"" and stretching type workouts. I skipped them in insanity too. I have limited time to excercise and like to break a good sweat with some killer cardio. Also, I am a woman and not AT ALL interested in working on my back. Again, have limited time...not enough cardio in these vids!!!

- ""Strength"" video is INCREDIBLY BORING. Im a woman and have been doing this with a 10lb weight. Not really feeling too challenged. Plus is boring. Really boring.

-I haven't done ""game day"" yet. ""speed and agility"" and ""plyo"" are fun but also incorporate moved from insanity that I don't necessarily think are good for your back to begin with, and that I often skipped (plank runs).

-I don't find it more difficult than month 2 of insanity.

OVERALL not enough cardio for me. Im still trying to lose some weight here and not turn into a beast with a huge shredded back or whatever.  The agility ladder and jump rope are pretty pointless and in my opinion just a gimmick.",1373932800,4,1664,4.411764705882353
4492544,5,B004X7I7A6,"This program is exactly what it says.  It comes with everything you need to perform (schedule, agility ladder, DVD).  It is also helpful if you have some resistance bands or free weights.  This program has worked more me and many friends.",1373673600,,238,4.7560975609756095

4492546,5,B004X7I7A6,"First off I would like to say I LOVE the insanity workout program and after completing that I was ready for a new challenge which is why I purchased The Asylum.

You get 6 disks: Fitness assessment (25min), speed & agility (45min), vertical plyo w/ relief (40min and 25min), strength or strength using bands (50min and 50min), gameday w/ overtime (60min and 15min), and back to core (45min). You get the asylum calander to count down your 30 days, which also shows the order in which to do the workouts. On the backside it has the Insanity/Asylum hybrid 30 day workout and also the Asylum/P90x hybrid 30 day workout. And a ""Get shredded"" 14 day meal plan and a small booklet to track your progress.

You also receive, which I wasn't thrilled about having to pay for, a beachbody jump rope and agility ladder. I'd prefer to have been able to purchase the dvd set without these included. 1) I already own both and 2) the jump rope is not a necessity for the workouts.

Here's a list of everything you COULD use to maximize your results I suppose. Dumbbells (I use 20lbs for any move that requires these), jump rope (provided), agility ladder (provided), pull up bar, exercise rubber bands to use around your wrists and ankles to increase resistance in certain moves.

Here's what you need as a bare minimum: Dumbbells and an agility ladder (provided).

Here's what I use: 20lb dumbbells, agility ladder, a yoga mat, and a set of those resistance rubber bands. I DO NOT use the jump rope, I don't have the ceiling height in my living room and you can do whatever they do WITHOUT it, which is why I don't understand why they make you pay extra for the provided jump rope when they sell it separately.

I won't go to into detail with the workouts. But I will say ""Gameday w/ Overtime"" is the hardest workout I've done between Insanity and The asylum, it's more difficult and lengthy than the max interval ones from insanity. The rest though (strength, speed & agility, back to core, and vertical plyo) are on par of difficulty with the regular insanity workouts just with agility ladder moves and then dumbbells in the strength video and a little dumbbell work in the back to core video. You can do the videos without a jump rope. And there are alternates for using the dumbbells instead of a pull up bar.

In addition, I am a 4.0 tennis player who is looking for something to keep my body in shape and match ready.  Insanity: The Asylum definitely challenged me to continue the mentality of ""digging deep"" as the workout routines places an emphasis on atheltic training and cardio.  This package contains less routines compared to the first Insanity program and is geared more for a time span of a month instead of two months.  However, the lack of quanity does mean lack of quality.

You will see similar exercises such as doing a high knee jog during the warm-up or plank runs during the routine but with the addition of a jump rope and ladder in the routines really challenges your body on coordination and agility.  You will find trying to the do the a high knee jog with a jump rope is not easy at all......and that's one only part of the warm-up.

After three weeks of tripping over myself and drowning in a pool of my own sweat, I began to see my body change.  My footwork during my tennis matches improved greatly.  I do have a complaint about the jump rope provided which broke by the third week of using it.

- You will notice your fitness level is increased as the days go by.

CONS:
- Not much. Maybe its just me, but including ""informercials"" on every single disc can get boring rather quickly.

4492572,5,B004X7I7A6,"This is a must have for people who loved Insanity.  The program has seven new workouts (Speed and Agility, Strength, Back to Core, Vertical Plyo, Game Day, Overtime and Relief).  The program comes with an agility ladder and a speed rope.  Other equipment that you may want (but is not required) is a pull-up bar and resistance bands.  Dumbbells or strength bands are needed for the Strength workout.  The workout doesn't have a particular ab workout, but it isn't needed because you will work your core in every workout.

I finished the Insanity program twice, but the results that I got from Asylum were more impressive than my results from Insanity.  Asylum is only 30 days compared to Insanity's 60 days.  I wouldn't recommend trying Asylum unless you are reasonably fit, or have made it through Insanity and can do most of the exercises in that program.  Asylum takes some of the moves from Insanity and makes them harder (e.g. resistance power jumps, one-legged power jumps, and resistance jack push-ups).  I still find myself modifying some of the Asylum moves to prevent possible injury.  Do NOT try a move if you cannot do it completely and safely.  If you can't land a jump with control and treating your knees like springs to protect them, don't do it and find an easier move to do.  Shaun has great instructions for safety and form.

This is not a workout for beginners and you really need to watch yourself. It's intense, you'll sweat buckets, and you'll be in pain, but I love workouts like this! It makes me feel like I've accomplished something. Not to mentioned the results are awesome!

4492584,4,B004X7I7A6,"I'm a huge fan of most of the entire Beachbody line of workouts and especially the Insanity series through Asylum 1 and 2.  Asylum 1 is a great workout series that takes it to the next level post-Insanity.  However, there certainly are some glaring weaknesses.
Pros:
1) excellent workout series, I have kept most of these workouts in my routine long after I finished the 30 days
2) super-challenging,
3) This is a great series to do alone and then start mixing into a hybrid Insanity/Aslyum schedule
4) The addition of the dumbbells and Strength workout is great (after 60 days of Insanity, I started the Asylum and after several Strength workouts, I really started noticing more definition)

Cons:
1) There are several times where Shaun leaves you in a plank position for several exercises in a row and its simply too much on the shoulders, especially during the Gameday workout
2) you honestly don't HAVE to have the agility ladder for this,
3) my biggest gripe about this is the warmup is harder than the rest of the workout on the Plyo and Speed & Agility workouts.
4) The Gameday workout honestly is kind of cheesy
5) While this is a great series to hybrid with Insanity, the hybrid schedule included seems almost haphazard and poorly thought out.  No matter the shape you're in, your legs will feel like they're in concrete by day 5 or 6.  It needs to vary muscle groups more.",1356739200,3,1382,4.624489795918367

4492589,3,B004X7I7A6,"Having graduated Insanity, Les Mils Pump, and Rev Abs, all excellent programs, I was ready to take on Asylum. While I enjoyed and appreciated the challenge of the jump rope and agility ladder, I was very careful in some of the other movements which require some explosive actions.

As a caveat, I'm 55 years old and in excellent physical condition. What Asylum moves you to is developing that explosive power in your legs, as well as speed, endurance and mental focus. The problem I had throughout many of the workouts was making sure I was always in perfect form so that I wouldn't blow out a knee or achilles. Well, on day 25, Game Day, my form was less than perfect and kapow, the knee got tweaked.

So, my caution to you is this: if you're ""older"" like me, physiologically your body has aged. Your ligaments, tendons, muscles aren't as flexible. You've worn the cartilage in knees and shoulders. This is a program that for you and me, frankly, invites injury.

If you're young and really trying to increase athletic performance, I think this is a 5 star. Whether it's track, football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, whatever, this program will help you. If you're simply looking to get in better shape, better even than Insanity, be careful with this program. It may set you back if you get injured. In any case, young or old, try and always use perfect form, and it's tough to do so when Shaun T has pushed you to the point of physical and mental exhaustion, which he does in this program.

If you haven't yet done Insanity, I will say THAT was life-changing in an amazing way. I dropped 23 pounds, got off blood pressure medication, and just got into awesome condition. I cannot recommend Insanity highly enough.",1354924800,10,1729,4.677631578947368

It is not much harder than Insanity, but it is more fun, more intense and goes at a faster pace. Warmups are specific as well - for example warmup for Strength is done with a dumbell, and they are short and intense. Streches are quick. Also the spread of different areas is a welcomed change - especially Strength workout. It is similar to Upper Body weights training from Insanity, but again - faster, more challenging and more focused.

Shaun T is more focused, and he sound less like a trainer, but more like a coach or even a drill instructor. He pushes the importance of mental attitude and focus, and tries to teach you how to be an athlete instead of just someone that exercises.

The program definitely delivers, and if you put effort into it - you will get results. But if you did Insanity the right way - you probably know that already.",1349308800,3,987,4.417582417582418
4492599,5,B004X7I7A6,"This is a great way to take your workouts to the next level and introduce variety to graduates of the Insanity program.  Shaun T drops the nurturing tone (not completely) in this series as he expects Insanity graduates to understand why is involved in this level of excercise.  Focus shifts to specific aspects of sports performance in volume one such as speed and agility, strength, game day tests etc. and introduce the use of tools such as the agility ladder and resistance bands (included in the box) which were not part of the original Insanity program.  I have been on the system for three weeks now (one week remaining) and it is everything I expected from an Insanity branded program.  It's not easy, and I'm not always happy while I'm doing it, but I always feel great afterwards.  Like Shaun T says in the videos: if you follow the workouts honestly and don't give up, this program will get your body to where it wants to be.

As is also stated in the videos, including the original Insanity series, you need to keep your own limits and skill level in mind when attempting some of the excercises in these videos.

4492600,3,B004X7I7A6,"After doing the first Insanity about 2.5 times I decided I'd give the Asylum a try. I'm halfway in at the time of this writing.

My primary complaint with the first Insanity is that it was really good at making my legs look and feel awesome, but my upper body and pudgy gut pretty much looked the same as the day I started my first round. A LOT of work for not enough pay off.

Asylum seems to remedy this a bit by incorporating Strength and Back/Core workouts that definitely target the upper body a lot more beyond just doing pushups.

So here's what I liked/didn't like:

LIKED:
- the Back to Core workout is probably the best back/core workout I've ever done. I have a lot of neck/back problems so usually doing most shoulder/back routines in a program is a injury kiss of death for me. This was the first one I did and actually felt pretty great afterwards. I especially like that you can exercise your abs without having to do situps or (what I consider to be worse) the v-style suspension exercises.
- New improved stretches are excellent. Insanity had a good collection of stretches and they've made them even better in Asylum.
- Full body focus like mentioned before without relying heavily on pushups.
- GameDay is brutally hard but a bit fun and creative.
- Having alternatives presented for weights, jump rope & pulls up is really nice

DIDN'T LIKE:
- If you thought the resting periods in Insanity were too short, you're going to be miserable in Asylum. I suppose that's fair given the difficulty increase, but at least in Insanity Shaun regularly encourages you to take breaks if your form is slipping. In Asylum he's now barking at you to always keep going and take ""2 breath"" breaks. This is injury bait, and while I realize the point is to push yourself I advise you to still take regular breaks if your form is slipping otherwise you're just begging to end up with neck/back problems like me.
- Asylum is a lot harder on your body than Insanity, the routines are longer than Insanity, but yet the Warmup/Cooldown stretches are a lot shorter than they were in Insanity. This makes little sense to me. And c'mon, having me do Vertical Plyo (2nd hardest thing) the day right after GameDay (most hardest)? That's just abusive. Warmup/Cooldowns were the biggest thing I liked about Insanity since I'm never sure what I should be stretching regularly and for how long, and having it in a routine made a huge difference in keeping injury down. Reducing it seems like a big mistake to me, especially for a routine that is more aggressive. Shaun T tells you to use the Relief video if you need it afterwards, but that's an extra 20 minutes to add to 50-60 minutes (and it still doesn't address the warmup).
- Like Insanity, Asylum is lacking a decent Yoga routine to help release the stress/anxiety that builds up when you're regularly beating the crap out of your body. The Relief routine comes close but mostly aims at stretching. Not saying we need to be chanting Ohms with Tony Horton here, but working towards a Savasana at the end has always done amazing things for me.

EDITED Final Verdict: I ended up reducing to 3 stars after just about having enough of my body feeling like a giant sore mangled knot 17 days into the program.
Worth a try ONLY if you've already done Insanity and are pretty comfortable with how far to safely push your body since Shaun T will no longer be looking out for that in this. I consider it better than Insanity personally since it's a lot more full body oriented, but the even more reduced period of recovery is just too much IMO. However I do recommend modifying it as necessary and trying to insert a yoga routine here and there, or mixing it into regular Insanity.",1345248000,46,3713,4.550898203592815
4492601,4,B004X7I7A6,The workouts were fun and intense. My only beef is that I didn't get enough. Luckily they include a calendar with hybrid programs.,1344729600,,130,4.695652173913044
4492602,4,B004X7I7A6,"I've spent countless hours wheezing and sweating on my living room floor, thanks to Beachbody products.  First, it was P90x.  Great results, but 90 days?  The time commitment was intense, and some of the workouts were an hour and a half!  Next, Insanity.  Two months, quicker fast paced workouts- NO equipment.  Got into great shape again, but eventually things were getting repetitive, and we wanted to try something new (my husband also does the programs with me).

Insanity Asylum was ordered.  Only 30 days!  That's exciting.  A month from my 30th birthday, I figured this would be perfect.  And it's pretty good.  First, the good:  Short workouts, or at least relatively speaking.  45 minutes on average, the longest one is an hour (+15 minutes if you do the 'overtime"").  VERY quick pace.  This workout never stops.  No 30 second breaks or long periods of breathing and stretching.  Some people might like this, but I have a terrible attention span and find myself inspecting my fat or looking at dust bunnies that have settled under the tv stand, and completely forgetting about the workout.  There is sufficient stretching to make sure you don't kill yourself or your muscles, and enough time for a sip of water here and there, but otherwise, you are going until you are done, so it just flies by, making it easier for me to push ""play"" every day.  The exercises work a bunch of different muscle groups at once, maximizing the efficiency of every moment.  Shaun T is a very approachable coach as well, I don't get bored with him, he doesn't make cheesy jokes, but he keeps you motivated throughout.

The negative--it does require a bit of equipment...I just got the ladder and the jump rope.  I don't use the rope (my house is too small), but you can use an ""imaginary"" rope and it works the same.  I had to go out and buy some weights, bands also work, but I prefer the weights. It requires a lot of space, with all the leaping and stuff.  My husband and I have to jockey for position if we are doing the workouts at the same time.  Some of the workouts are a bit confusing, and geared specifically towards people who have played sports--which I have not.  There is a ""Game Day"" DVD that is particularly confusing to me, as a lot of the moves refer to different sports- wrestling, tennis, baseball, etc.  It helps to have done Insanity, as the moves are based on moves you learned before, but you eventually get the hang of it.  The convoluted aspect of some of the exercises is why I knocked off a star.  When my 30 days are finished (in two days) I plan on doing a hybrid of my favorite Insanity DVDs and Asylum DVDs.

Finally, the results.  Good!  You really need to commit to get results, and make sure to keep the core tight.  I've seen some great results, but plan on doing it once more to really get my body where I want it.  I don't follow the diet plans, but I do eat well.  Oh, by the way, there's only 2 days off.  In 30 days.  I am the most happy with my upper body strength.  Asylum has a workout that Insanity is lacking--strength.  My push ups have greatly improved, and picking up heavy boxes and things is no problem now.  Working out every day is a little bit time consuming, but I feel really good, very healthy, with a lot more energy.  I love the Beachbody programs because I don't live near a gym and the minor cost of the programs really ends up cheaper in the long run than gym membership.

You should not be obese or in terrible physical condition if you plan on doing this.  The moves are intense -- there is A LOT of jumping, so beware if you have serious knee issues.  Otherwise-have fun with it!  Gotta go, need to work out, only two more days to go!",1341014400,19,3688,4.429210134128167
4492603,5,B004X7I7A6,"As a P90X user and having completed P90X2 earlier this year I knew my weakness was cardio.  I read reviewers on Amazon for their thoughts on Asylum and I feel is is money well spent (if you use it).

 I have just completed the 30 days (though it took me about 40 as I needed more rest days in-between) of straight Asylum.  My goal was to finish each workout, which I did.  They were tough....really tough and some moves (like other reviewers) I still haven't ""mastered"".  I'm 43 years old, not overweight but I'm always looking for ways to improve my overall health. What changed after the 30 days (now remember I have completed X2....).....first, my gluts are lifted (and ladies you KNOW they are the last to improve), my legs are stronger and have great tone, and back muscles are stunning!  My cardio recovery time has shortened(I wear a heart monitor) , which is why I did this program to begin with!

Here is what I did to ""finish"":

~found worksheets online to print (for me this helps push myself, Shaun uses timed intervals and sometimes I could only complete 30 seconds out of the one minute...but next time I could push myself to do more)

~didn't use jump rope (I tried, but it became too cumbersome for me...I ""mimed"" the rope hopefully this is a skill I can develop)

~buy the ladder...this is key...sounds like you won't use it or need it but it makes you accountable for each move

~you WILL sweat (I never really was drenched after any of the P90x workouts, but Shaut T will make sure you do)

~don't give up (there were days I yelled at Shaun....I hated, dreaded doing some of the workouts....UGGH....but I knew I had to so I could improve, don't we all hate doing what we are not good at)

~rest (I required more rest inbetween, your body will let you know if you have to rest...listen to it)

~added Ab routine (midway through the program I added the P90X2 ab routine BEFORE I did Shaun's workout)

~looked forward to my favorite workout (Back to Core)

Today is my final fit test day...looking forward to seeing what progress was made.  On day one, I had problems with the warm up.....by day 20 it was a breeze (somewhat).  Also....be of good cheer, the Army vets in the workouts take ""mini-breaks"" too...that made me feel like they were human after all.

What's next: P90X2 and Asylum hybrid",1339891200,6,2312,4.512019230769231

4492605,5,B004X7I7A6,"This is perfect for once you complete insanity.  You don't need a tone of room like others are saying.  Jumping rope is the only issue, but its typically only on warm ups and you can do all the warm up moves without a jump rope.  Just adds intesity but there is plenty of that in the workout.",1336435200,11,292,4.087719298245614
4492606,2,B004X7I7A6,"I have the P90x p90x2 Insanity and Insanity Asylum.  Like them all except for the Asylum for several reasons.
1) You need lots of room.  The ladder itself is 6 feet long and you need to step outside the ladder.  So at least an area no less than 8 feet long.  Then you need width to step back.  I have a 2 car garage where I workout and its not big enough.  My workout area is about half the garage so approx. a 10x10 area and I prefer more room.
2)  You need at least a month just to learn the workouts.  He goes straight into the moves without any instructions and you are required to keep up.  Not too much of an issue but worth mentioning.  Just remember to take a least a month to learn the moves.
3)  Its extremely tough.  Not for the above average athletic person.  Almost have to be a track star to do it.  If you watch closely, even his students are struggling and take breaks but of course the cameras do not show that.  Speaking of the cameras.  Its hard to learn the moves because the cameras are jumping all over the place.  You try to watch someone do a move to learn, then the cameras shift to another person doing just what you seen.
Conclusion:
Take it slowly and learn the moves (at least a month).  Do not even waste your time if you are not in great cardio shape.  Lastly, make sure you have ample of room.  I know if you watch the video, they are working out in small areas.  But if you take notice, they are strategically placed to give them lots of room.
How to improve:
Make sure all this is noted before the purchase.",1331769600,28,1541,4.121212121212121
4492607,4,B004X7I7A6,"While deployed, I worked out using the original insanity and ended with a Rushfit/insanity extension.  I wanted to build the cardio and conditioning to start Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu again when I returned.  Around day 45, I got addicted to the punishment that is Insanity, so I randomly thought ""I wonder if there's a sequel?"" So I went on my search. I bought the program while still deployed the day it came out, and grabbed it from family when I returned.

I have no issue with P90X and Insanity. They are both great programs with a different routes and goals to fitness, but I always wondered if they could be more technically aligned for athletes. I was hoping asylum would be that for me, and it turns out that it is!

Insanity: The Asylum is a 30 day program that is meant to build athletic function. Various drills from sports are thrown in at a crushing pace reminiscent of Insanity. The approach however, is much more balanced with added equipment required (Dumbbells, Agility ladder, Jump rope, Resistance bands, a pullup bar if available), and a new concept behind the madness. Plyometrics (You will not escape this lol), agility, speed, power, balance, flexibility, and strength are all emphasized at various levels.

Shaun T isn't very friendly this time around unfortunately. He will never say it's ok to stop, and will continue to push you to newer levels. Mp3 players are your friend. lol

Some claim the cardio isn't as intense as insanity, but if you think you'll easily get through asylum after 60 days of Insanity, or 90 of P90X, then you are in for a rude awakening. I personally think it's much harder, and more technical. The moves are more complicated, and if you truly push yourself, you will be sweating buckets. I almost went through an entire gallon of water the first time I did Gameday + Overtime. It's a killer combo.

My Muay Thighs are back (Yay! Lol), so I returned to Muay Thai today to see how well it applied over.

For those of you that may have not read my review of insanity, I actually quit Insanity the first time after 30 days because I gassed quicker in Muay Thai then I thought I would after dealing with Shaun for a month.

But today after over a year without training with my Kru, and completing another round of Asylum, I went back to Muay Thai.
It went really well. I'm a terrible critic of myself, and I felt that I did good, but not great. However, my partners, the assistant instructor, and the apprentice teaching the class all said I have a great gas tank and power. My kicks and knees were a bit more powerful and explosive then they were before. I wasn't able to pull out my new awesome jump rope skills (No jumping rope for class today lol), but I was very happy with the results. My recovery is much better too. Usually after Muay Thai, I just perish into my bed, but today I almost felt like I could go at it again no problem.

It seems as though beachbody is stepping their game up with Asylum and P90X2. They are more complicated, more technical sequels to the original programs, and I really admire them for going the functional route.

Asylum is EXTREME.

It is recommended that one go through a previous product, or be at a level of fitness where they do comfortably on the fitness assessment provided. For insanity users, Shaun recommends a ""Feeling of accomplishment"" when doing Max Interval Plyo as a means of determining if you are ready. I went from doing around 50 to over 200 pushups with that workout as my own personal gauge (Along with keeping up for the most part with it).
I'm not in this war of attrition for looks, but to be functionally fit, healthy, and to be a great Martial Artist. The ""Sports"" emphasis of Asylum drew me in. I had a feeling the gains would throw me back into Martial Arts with many new found abilities. It is right up my alley, and while I will continue looking for newer things, at this point in time I consider Asylum my base workout just like Tae Kwon Do and Muay Thai are my base martial arts.

I took a star off (A half really) for just minor gripes:
- The strength workout doesn't really have a proper warmup. You just start lifting.
- The stretching isn't bad, but it feels kind of rushed in some of the dvds. Granted, relief is always there to help with that, but that shouldn't mean the stretching included in the workout itself should be rushed.
- I recommend a person first starting out to watch the videos a few times to get a grasp for the moves. They can be pretty complicated at times.

I'm of course eagerly awaiting Insanity The Asylum Volume 2.",1326499200,63,4571,4.4849578820697955
4492608,5,B004X7I7A6,"I ordered Asylum on Jan 9th with a rush delivery and it cam on the 10th...I begin on the 10th and I am on my 4th workout....I am down 5 lbs....It is difficult to say the least but doable....With the workout, you should follow their diet or some sort of nutrition plan to see max results...will update in the near future.",1326412800,2,320,4.262295081967213
4492609,5,B004X7I7A6,"The title of the workout series pretty much says it all.  I'm a P90X and Insanity graduate and had just stumbled across this new workout series.  Needless to say, I'm like a lot of people I think where I can do these series get really good results and then after awhile I get bored with them and the weight comes back on.  With Insanity, I lost nearly 30 pounds during that craziness and can't wait to see the results on this program.

The booklets that come with this series are nowhere near as nice as the Insanity ones, but I guess that doesn't really matter.  I would classify them more as pamphlets than anything else.  The products are cheap, but they don't really need to be sturdy for what they are used for.  I will say that my ladder's ""ropes"" were somehow twisted and from what I can see, there is no way to undo them, straighten them out and feed them back in the ladder.

After the first workout, my thighs and legs were shaking.  The work with the jump rope and ladder is absolutely BRUTAL and by far the hardest workout I've ever done.

I will update my post as a sort of ongoing weekly diary so that you and I can follow along with my progress and weight loss.  I will not follow the recommended diet or eating plan, as I generally eat fairly well.

Starting weight at the beginning of the series 203.8

Don't be afraid to join in people, we can get through the Asylum together.",1325289600,,1394,4.295019157088123
4492610,5,B004X7I7A6,"I bought this as a gift for my son so can't attest personally to its quality.  He , however, is very satisfied.  There was no problem with this order.",1325203200,,150,4.137931034482759
4492611,5,B004X7I7A6,"Insanity Asylum is such a great workout program! I graduated from a P90X-Insanity hybrid and Asylum was so difficult! I am currently doing a P90X-Insanity-Asylum hybrid and the asylum days are the ones guaranteed to be difficult. I always plan an easy workout on the next day for it because I know I'll be pooped.

My favorite workout is the strength workout. It is much harder than any of the P90X strength routines. So for those who are looking for a challenge or are getting bored with Insanity or P90X this is a great program to try out. I've never done the whole program scheduled but I've seen videos of people getting amazing results in such a short amount of time, especially athletes trying to jump higher or run faster.

In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this workout program for anybody who has graduated from Insanity and has gotten in shape enough to get through each Insanity workout without having to completely turn off the workout in the middle of it. If you can't finish an Insanity workout without giving up half way then you are not ready for the asylum.

One thing that will reassure you that this program works is to look at Shaun T's results and progress over the years from developing this program. Look for a clip from Hip Hop Abs. He's in pretty good shape. Look at Insanity. He has for sure gotten bigger and more ripped in his abs. Now look at Insanity Asylum. He abs and chest look so crazy compared to his hip hop abs days!!",1324684800,7,1454,4.520912547528517

The equipment, calendar, and packaging are standard Beachbody.  I would highly recommend this product.  With any type of fitness product, if you're diet is not right, you will not see the results.

4492615,4,B004X7I7A6,"I have tried a number of the Beach Body series and like to mix it up and do the variety after finishing a round of the latest purchase; so far have done the P90x, Chalean Extreme, Insanity, Chalean Turbo fire, P90x Plus, and now Asylum.  They all have their advantages and disadvantages and just depends on what you like.  This is like the Insanity; Shawn T is more cut and looks leaner and there is a core of the Sports Team that trains in each video of this 30 day program.  I went through it like it instructs and when done, there was a calendar for mixing either P90x or Insanity, I started the P90x mix but the suggested calendar wasn't a good pattern for me; so have been doing my own program a hybrid of these.  The good thing about Shawn T's programs is that it is very aerobic and you do work up quite a sweat; don't really think his ab workouts are as good as the P90x ab ripper, but you will burn calories and will sweat more than any of the others I mentioned.  Asylum is a step more intense than Insanity; but doable and challenging and adds some variety.  The Game Day is fun with some of the different ""events"" and sports he tries to mix in to make it like a ""game day"" in a sports training; though a bit to contrived.

4492616,5,B004X7I7A6,"I bought this after i graduated so i could stay in shape since i would no longer be playing high school sports. I was very pleased with the program because Shaun T is a great trainer and knows how to push you farther. The exercises are somewhat simple but the pace at which you do them is what make this workout program better than any other on the market. This got me from my somewhat okay 6 pack to a crazy 8 pack in 30 days!!!! The only thing i didn't like is the meals that they had for you in the book, i didn't follow the plan because none of the food look good. But if you are completely determined to get a better body, then i guess it would be a good idea to follow the meal plan no matter how the food taste.",1315353600,13,718,3.9246575342465753

8446374,5,B004X7I7A6,"I am an Insanity junkie and have completed the Insanity, Max 30 and T25 a few times. To change things up, I tried the Asylum and gosh am I just loving it. Shaun works on every aspect of the body and mixes it up with body, weights and bands for both strength and cardio. Moreover I used to sometimes get injuries especially from the Max 30, which has not happened since getting on the Asylum. I keep feeling it's the result of the workouts being more balanced and focusing on areas like the back and core equally.

Overall, having stepped into my 40s, I was reluctant at first but now think it's the best thing. Highly recommend giving it a try for anyone wanting a full workout routine -- be warned it can be additive!",1500163200,,718,4.318518518518519
