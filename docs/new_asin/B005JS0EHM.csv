8475960,5,B005JS0EHM,"Have read and seen a lot of movies about the war, but this film has shown me several thing that I was not aware of before.  Well done film and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in history.",1453334400,,203,3.951219512195122
8475961,5,B005JS0EHM,EXCELLENT!  This is one of the best surveys of the Pacific War I have seen to date (and I've seen a lot of them).  The narration is first rate and the use of  original footage combined with graphics and interviews with those who were there on both sides.  This is more than worth money.  Everyone should have it in their library.  I long for the days when the history channel actually did history.,1441238400,,397,4.36986301369863
8475962,5,B005JS0EHM,Excellent series for anyone interested in the history of the United States Marine Corps island hopping Pacific campaign. God bless all of them.,1427414400,,143,5.260869565217392
8475963,5,B005JS0EHM,This is an exceptionally good documentary on the major island campaigns of WW II. Very good narration and the map displays to show disposition of forces was very helpful in understanding the tactics. The interviews of veterans were also most interesting. I would be surprised if anyone had a negative take on this series..,1423785600,3,322,4.981481481481482
8475964,4,B005JS0EHM,"Like most WWII buffs, I have quite a variety of dvds covering the topic, especially on the pacific. This one doesn't have a lot of new clips from the combat photographers, but it does have some portions where veterans talk about their experiences.  Most of the time, I found their comments interesting and enjoyable, adding value to the video specific to their experiences.

The series is well done, IMO, with good narration and they cleaned up the original movies quite nicely. They did a better job of cleaning them up than what I think is the ""norm"" for the dvds that I've seen. The additional information about each segment was also interesting.  Seems that they really did their homework.

The title of the dvd is rather strange. Apparently, the ""lost evidence"" is simply the original recon photos of a given location. They talk about them as if they're going to show you those photos blown up, so you can see what the intel guys saw back in the day. But, that doesn't happen. Instead they show you some nicely done graphical representations of what those photos might show you.  I really wanted to see the blow ups of those original photos, which is why I only gave 4 stars to this otherwise very good dvd.

Bottom line for me, I'm happy with the video and enjoyed it.",1421539200,4,1274,4.590308370044053
