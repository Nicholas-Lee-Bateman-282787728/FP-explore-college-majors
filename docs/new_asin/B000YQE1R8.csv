3034783,4,B000YQE1R8,This workout is pretty simple and easy to follow after the 1st time. It really does get results after a few weeks of using it 4-5 times a week. I like the fact that you are lying on the floor the whole time (so it is good for those of us who are sometimes lazy!) I'm pleased with the purchase and hope to continue to see results!,1268870400,6,329,3.925373134328358
3034784,5,B000YQE1R8,"I have to say, this is one of the workouts that I can really stick with.  It doesn't put any undue stress on your feet or knees, the circle helps you with the exercises, and also gives you an added workout option for your arms, chest, legs and glutes.

The workout is simple to follow and very easy to do every night if you desire.  I am seeing improvements in my appearance and flexibility, as well as posture.

Highly recommend it!",1266710400,,433,4.308641975308642
3034785,5,B000YQE1R8,The accelerated fat burning work out is amazing.  I've lost 30 lbs in 3 months with this being my sole source of exercise.  I do it 6 days a week and love the results it gives my body.,1256169600,15,184,3.8157894736842106
3034786,4,B000YQE1R8,"This DVD has sat on my shelf for 2+ years, and I had never used it once, until about a week ago. So I finally decided to dust it off, and give it a try. I am hooked.

This DVD is divided up into sections. You can watch an intro to the workouts, and it will show you how the exercises are done, proper form, etc. After you get the hang of it, you can go into the workout itself. I love that you don't have to watch the 'how to' section every time you work out. The menu is easy to navigate, and allows for easy switching between workouts.

The 20 minute circle workout is awesome. Having the resistance circle adds a lot to the workout, and really forces you to concentrate on your form. I was really sore the first few days after doing the 20 minute workout. Now that the soreness is wearing off, I've added the 10 minute sculpting workout and I do them back to back.

Mari Winsor does a great job of explaining the exercises, reminding you to breathe, and reinforcing good form. Simple to follow, and the exercises seem to flow nicely. Great for beginners, these workouts are challenging, yet easy to learn. Its rewarding to see my body toning up in such a short amount of time.

I enjoy this DVD immensly, and it motivates me to get out of bed at 5:30am to work out.",1250467200,58,1268,4.184426229508197

3034789,5,B000YQE1R8,"This is what I was looking for. I was a little sceptical, almost sorry after I ordered it (you know how commercials can secude you...). A previous winsor pilates VHS had bad quality and another Pilates dvd seemed better value for money. But I was curious about the circle...

Though it seems a bit odd to use at first (is this just another gadget?), it makes total sense. A lot of pilates exercises focus on your tummy and your legs, but not your arms and chest. The circle does not only make your exercise very efficient (working various muscles at the same time), also the stomach muscles are trained harder with the aid of the circle.

I am not always proud of my discipline, but this is my 5th week of sticking to the 3x a week 20 minute work out. I really do like it, I felt the results in the first week (ok, that was a muscle ache) and could really see it on my legs the 2nd and 3rd weeks. By now I can see my stomach flatten, to the point where the muscles actually make it bulge a little again :-).

Then it also has a ten minutes pilates blaster and a dance routine for extra cardio. I am doing the 30 minutes, three times a week and working up to the dancing segment. I love what it has done for my joints.  I feel like I took an oil can to my joints.  It has made me feel like a new woman with pep in her step. And as an added benefit it has sculpted my body.

The 20 minute workout is my favorite and the only one I use on this DVD. My mom likes it also and asked me to buy her a copy. It sculpts, strengthens and stretches the whole body. I feel really good every time after the workout. They are a challenging yet totally doable for all levels. I highly recommend it.",1385942400,2,429,3.831460674157303

3034812,5,B000YQE1R8,"I like the way Mari does Pilates.  I have purchased other Pilate videos from different people instructing them.  They were hard to follow because I don't do Pilates on a regular basis.  I like the stretches that Mari does.  She got me in shape like Cindy did too but in a different way.  The two work out videos work together.  I'm still not the weight I would like but I'm getting there.  It's partly because I keep eating sweets.  It's not the videos, it's my eating habits, I need to change them.  :)  I'm a 41 year old mom and looking and doing good thanks to those videos.  Mari's Winsor Pilates and Cindy Crawford's work out video.  I really don't know which I like better.  I mix them up in a week.  I like how they teach you how to breathe.  Life is simpler for me when I exercise.  I with the classes outside of my home offered watching Mari or Cindy and then doing the aerobics together.  But I guess being able to exercise at home is nice too because I'm saving money.  :)",1381276800,,983,4.221621621621622

3034818,3,B000YQE1R8,This dvd was just ok.  I own 2-3 other windsor pilates dvds and they are much better than this one.  I prefer a full body workout when I do pilates and want to feel that I was challenged.  This dvd really did not seem as challenging as other Windsor workouts.  It was kind of boring too.  I would recommend the full version of the Windor advanced fat buring workout (I got it on Amazon too),1325376000,3,390,4.1466666666666665

3034823,5,B000YQE1R8,"I bought this DVD used here on amazon (good experience) and was surprised to discover that this DVD comes with three workouts.  There is the 20 min circle workout, which I really liked.  It's all floor exercises and I find that it is a good workout in the evening on days when I am taking a break from my cardio routine.  There is also a bonus 10 min circle workout, that is a standing routine and I found that this compliments perfectly with the 20 min circle (floor) routine, and like the 20 min circle workout, time passes quickly.  I am still a beginner at pilates and found that both of these workouts allowed me to follow along without too much confusion.  Lastly, there is a cardio accelerated fat burning workout, which is like doing an aerobics workout.  I didn't care for it that much (I'd rather do zumba), but really I bought the dvd for the circle workout, so I am very happy with it.  I can definitely feel it in my abs and legs and the circle (I bought one at a local store for less than $10) is VERY good at helping you to keep your form and concentrate the work at your core.",1312416000,16,1092,4.246376811594203

3034825,5,B000YQE1R8,"I have purchased about 8 million workout products. This is the only one that I have done repeatedly. I love it. It's fast, and I really feel a difference without feeling like I'm killing myself and getting really sweaty and gross. My posture improves and my stomach tightens up when I do this routine regularly! It's also great it's so simple and only 20 minutes-perfect for fitting into a hectic schedule!!",1305331200,3,407,4.746478873239437
3034826,5,B000YQE1R8,"I bought this system forever ago and lost 20 pounds without really changing how I ate(I'm really bad with diets.) But then I lost the circle and started to really eat poorly and before I knew it, I earned 15 of those pounds back. I recently repurchased the circle and I am so glad I did.

The circle is a great piece of equipment and if you don't feel like doing one of the videos you can just use it while you watch tv before you go to bed. But with the video you really get a toning workout. It's amazing. I usually can't stick with a workout but this one is so quick I can do it 3+ times a week. You're not going to wake up 20 pounds thinner but you will see results pretty quickly. I also like that she includes several workouts that help with love handles because those are my biggest problem and they are so hard to work out.

Another thing that I love about this is the 50 minute Accelerated Fat Burning Workout. It really works you hard. The warm up is quick and has a lot of great stretches, then you start the routine. That thing is hard to do. It's really fast pace so don't be surprised if you get a little confused as to what you are to do next, each time you do it you get better and if you do it frequently you WILL see results.

This DVD(with the circle of course) is a must have for me and I highly recommend it.",1299974400,12,1329,4.007547169811321
3034827,5,B000YQE1R8,I love the 20 minute circle workout! I normally will do 20-30 minutes of cardo first then put this video in. It helps to stretch out the body and your abs get a great workout. They show both the beginner and advance way to do moves so anyone can follow. I did try the Fat Burning video and it was okay - 9 times out of 10 if I'm putting the dvd in it's for the 20 minute workout with the circle. I recommend that section to everyone!

3269303,5,B000YQE1R8,"I like the length of the video.  It's more than ten minutes so it seems like more of a workout than others I've tried, but it's not so long that you're dead by the end.  And my legs were shaking halfway through, so it seemed like it must be doing something.",1394150400,,257,4.019607843137255
3269304,4,B000YQE1R8,"I accidentally destroyed the original one I had.  I haven't used it in years but I liked the fact that I could do the workout in only 20 mins at home.  Then it also has a ten minutes pilates blaster and a dance routine for extra cardio. I am doing the 30 minutes, three times a week and working up to the dancing segment. I love what it has done for my joints.  I feel like I took an oil can to my joints.  It has made me feel like a new woman with pep in her step. And as an added benefit it has sculpted my body.  I have lost inches.",1393027200,11,535,3.7410714285714284

The 20 minute workout is my favorite and the only one I use on this DVD. My mom likes it also and asked me to buy her a copy. It sculpts, strengthens and stretches the whole body. I feel really good every time after the workout. They are a challenging yet totally doable for all levels. I highly recommend it.",1385942400,2,429,3.831460674157303

The Pilates Ring has no elasticity whatsoever.

3269309,5,B000YQE1R8,"I like the way Mari does Pilates.  I have purchased other Pilate videos from different people instructing them.  They were hard to follow because I don't do Pilates on a regular basis.  I like the stretches that Mari does.  She got me in shape like Cindy did too but in a different way.  The two work out videos work together.  I'm still not the weight I would like but I'm getting there.  It's partly because I keep eating sweets.  It's not the videos, it's my eating habits, I need to change them.  :)  I'm a 41 year old mom and looking and doing good thanks to those videos.  Mari's Winsor Pilates and Cindy Crawford's work out video.  I really don't know which I like better.  I mix them up in a week.  I like how they teach you how to breathe.  Life is simpler for me when I exercise.  I with the classes outside of my home offered watching Mari or Cindy and then doing the aerobics together.  But I guess being able to exercise at home is nice too because I'm saving money.  :)",1381276800,,983,4.221621621621622

3269315,3,B000YQE1R8,This dvd was just ok.  I own 2-3 other windsor pilates dvds and they are much better than this one.  I prefer a full body workout when I do pilates and want to feel that I was challenged.  This dvd really did not seem as challenging as other Windsor workouts.  It was kind of boring too.  I would recommend the full version of the Windor advanced fat buring workout (I got it on Amazon too),1325376000,3,390,4.1466666666666665
3269316,5,B000YQE1R8,I have been looking for a simple starter video for using a pilates circle for a long time. Finally a simple and effective video with Winsor Pilates. We all know it is about disipline to get results and this will.,1317254400,,212,4.325

3269318,3,B000YQE1R8,"I love Mari Windsor and have a number of her dvds that I have used for years. I had never tried a circle workout, but I trusted Mari, so I bought this along with a circle.

The workout is rather short and I did not feel as if I had done much after it was over. I think I will have to purchase another circle workout dvd to get the workout I am looking for.",1315699200,,356,3.7466666666666666
3269319,5,B000YQE1R8,"I got the DVD for the ring workout, but the Accelerated Fat Burning is my favorite awesome workout.  They have the flamenco music that make the workout fun and easy, and Mary Winsor is so good and inspiring to follow the sound of the music.  Great buy because I got it in sale, and the seller was fast and sold a good quality product.  Thank you so much.",1312848000,2,354,4.176470588235294
3269320,5,B000YQE1R8,"I bought this DVD used here on amazon (good experience) and was surprised to discover that this DVD comes with three workouts.  There is the 20 min circle workout, which I really liked.  It's all floor exercises and I find that it is a good workout in the evening on days when I am taking a break from my cardio routine.  There is also a bonus 10 min circle workout, that is a standing routine and I found that this compliments perfectly with the 20 min circle (floor) routine, and like the 20 min circle workout, time passes quickly.  I am still a beginner at pilates and found that both of these workouts allowed me to follow along without too much confusion.  Lastly, there is a cardio accelerated fat burning workout, which is like doing an aerobics workout.  I didn't care for it that much (I'd rather do zumba), but really I bought the dvd for the circle workout, so I am very happy with it.  I can definitely feel it in my abs and legs and the circle (I bought one at a local store for less than $10) is VERY good at helping you to keep your form and concentrate the work at your core.",1312416000,16,1092,4.246376811594203
3269321,5,B000YQE1R8,"While I haven't done much with this dvd yet, the quality is good and Winsor's teaching method is excellent.  It does not come with a ring but these can be purchased at Amazon.com and received within a couple of weeks.",1311033600,2,217,4.425
3269322,5,B000YQE1R8,"I have purchased about 8 million workout products. This is the only one that I have done repeatedly. I love it. It's fast, and I really feel a difference without feeling like I'm killing myself and getting really sweaty and gross. My posture improves and my stomach tightens up when I do this routine regularly! It's also great it's so simple and only 20 minutes-perfect for fitting into a hectic schedule!!",1305331200,3,407,4.746478873239437
3269323,5,B000YQE1R8,"I bought this system forever ago and lost 20 pounds without really changing how I ate(I'm really bad with diets.) But then I lost the circle and started to really eat poorly and before I knew it, I earned 15 of those pounds back. I recently repurchased the circle and I am so glad I did.

The circle is a great piece of equipment and if you don't feel like doing one of the videos you can just use it while you watch tv before you go to bed. But with the video you really get a toning workout. It's amazing. I usually can't stick with a workout but this one is so quick I can do it 3+ times a week. You're not going to wake up 20 pounds thinner but you will see results pretty quickly. I also like that she includes several workouts that help with love handles because those are my biggest problem and they are so hard to work out.

Another thing that I love about this is the 50 minute Accelerated Fat Burning Workout. It really works you hard. The warm up is quick and has a lot of great stretches, then you start the routine. That thing is hard to do. It's really fast pace so don't be surprised if you get a little confused as to what you are to do next, each time you do it you get better and if you do it frequently you WILL see results.

This DVD(with the circle of course) is a must have for me and I highly recommend it.",1299974400,12,1329,4.007547169811321
3269324,5,B000YQE1R8,I love the 20 minute circle workout! I normally will do 20-30 minutes of cardo first then put this video in. It helps to stretch out the body and your abs get a great workout. They show both the beginner and advance way to do moves so anyone can follow. I did try the Fat Burning video and it was okay - 9 times out of 10 if I'm putting the dvd in it's for the 20 minute workout with the circle. I recommend that section to everyone!
