8483166,5,B0016JDFEM,"I gave this DVD as a present for my friend's eight-year-old son and he's crazy about it!
He still does the Beginners Level of this series, but he's very proud to have 'graduated' up to this harder level before his little sister.  He can now hold the poses longer and my friend says she can see an improvement in his balance and agility even when he plays other sports like soccer.  Also, my friend was so happy about how doing the meditation has helped him to focus his mind and energy, which is helping him to concentrate on his studies.
I went to visit them recently and asked him what he liked the best about it...and he says he likes it because ""it's fun!!""  He thinks that the Super Hero pose is really ""tight.""  And, my friend told me that it's a great help for her because he can do yoga class with a group of kids any time he wants, without her having to drive through rain or snow to get him there!",1269302400,,907,4.195402298850575
8483167,1,B0016JDFEM,"I WAS HOPING IT WAS OKAY FOR KIDS 8-11 YEARS OLD, BUT IT WAS CHEESY AND IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS DOING A KINDERGARTEN CLASS. I ALSO DIDN'T LIKE THE BACKGROUND SETTING BEHIND THE KIDS, IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE FLOATING IN CLOUDS, THE COLORS WOULD CHANGE AND IT WAS JUST SO NOT WHAT YOGA IS SUPPOSE TO BE.  I THINK KIDS NEED TO SEE HOW YOGA LOOKS ON THE GROUND AND HOW YOU MAKE YOUR BODY MOVE TO ENSURE PROPER POSITION. IT DID NOT SATISFY MY TASTE, PLEASE DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY.",1242432000,,473,4.086021505376344
8483168,5,B0016JDFEM,I bought this video for my nephew and niece (7 and 3 years old) and they just love it!  They have so much fun acting like animals -- shaking like a hippo and waddling like a duck.  This is a very child-friendly class and so easy to follow that the kids quickly learned all the poses.  The teacher has a kind and welcoming style -- the kids really like practicing with her.  I put it on when they come to visit me and it's a great way for them to get exercise even if it's cold or rainy outside.,1223856000,,494,3.95959595959596
