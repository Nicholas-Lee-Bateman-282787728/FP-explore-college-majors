8567947,4,B00BG4RQC4,"Dramatizations of otherwise true stories. In general, they seem more and more bogus  but still somewhat entertaining. (If you're after solid facts, watch the series One Step Beyond, although parts can be a bit boring.) Much time is spent on relationships  unlike Season 1, which kept the focus on learning about phenomena. Certain episodes need to be seen in order, and even allude to events from previous seasons.
The audio is rather low, especially voices, and most especially with certain actors.
Packaged as a single stack of disks in a thick DVD case. The cover art wrongfully makes the show seem more about horror than about scientific investigations.
Amazon wrongly lists Dan Aykroyd as an actor therein; he merely introduces each episode, and comments on it afterwards.",1493596800,,777,5.110236220472441
