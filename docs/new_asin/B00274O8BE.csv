3857996,4,B00274O8BE,"NOTE:  This is the SAME workout that was originally marked under the title ""Squeeze.""

In her Introduction to this workout, instructor Tracy Effinger describes it as a combination of yoga, ballet, and athletic exercises. Unlike with many other barre workouts, Tracy wears sneakers throughout here. She instructs live in an indoor studio setting, although during the workout, the scene shifts to images of her exercising on a rooftop setting as well. She uses light dumbbells for the upper body work--she recommends 1-3 lbs. but states that she is using 2 lbs.--and for the lower body, she uses a chair, a mat, and a rubber playground ball (I substituted a Pilates ring, which worked pretty well).

The Main Menu of this DVD offers three options: Full Body Squeeze, Power Squeeze, and Custom Squeeze. Only the Custom Squeeze section has its own submenu, which makes the DVD somewhat difficult to navigate (more on this below). I have broken down each of the three workout options, including approximate times and brief descriptions of each chapter point.

FULL BODY SQUEEZE (56.5m)
*Warmup (2m)--Tracy performs the knees up/arms up usually found in barre workouts, but she also does knees/arms to the side. She ends with a forward bend stretch.
*Arms (8m)--This segment definitely burns the shoulders; the weights might feel light at first, but you will feel it towards the end! Tracy does variations of lateral raises, shoulder presses, and chest presses; she also incorporates a bit of biceps work.
*Triceps (4m)--You start in a traditional 1-arm kickback position, except that Tracy has you perform pulses with the arm straight; she does several variations. I felt this the next day!
*Waist (3.5m)--Standing in a wide-legged stance and still holding the weights, Tracy does reaches both overhead and down to the ankles.
*Push-Ups (4m)--Tracy sets up to perform push-ups on the knees, doing one set of 2-count push-ups and then a second set double-time. She also performs tricep dips on the floor, adding in a leg raise to up the challenge. A brief seated stretch for both the triceps and the hips concludes this segment.
*Standing Stretch Series (<3m)--Tracy uses the chair to stretch the hamstrings: you will place one foot on the chair, stretching over and around that leg, and then repeat on the other side (nice!).
*Legs (5m)--This segment also uses the chair for barre work. Tracy includes the v-plie, the wide-leg plie, and ""the uncomfortable chair""; she also adds little twists, such as what she calls the ""John Travolta move."" She concludes with a quad stretch.
*Seated Stretch (7m)--This nice long stretch segment begins on the floor with a camel variation, then moves into a lunge series which stretches both the hip flexors and the hamstrings, moving towards splits. Tracy ends with standing pyramid and standing forward bend.
*The ""L"" (6m)--Here Tracy has you lie on your mat with your legs perpendicular to your body. She then moves you through many different variations on leg lifts to really get into the outer thighs and glutes; this is especially tough when you get to the SECOND leg!
*The Abs ""C"" (5.5m)--This segment uses the ball, mostly between the thighs. Tracy forms a ""C"" shape with the torso and performs various curls in this position while squeezing the ball in place.
*Buns & Thighs (4m)--This is a pelvic tilt series, but the unique aspect is that Tracy sets you up with your feet on the wall, with your legs forming a 90-degree angle. In this position, you perform various pelvic tilt variations, such as heels only, toes in, etc.
*Final Stretch (3.5)--Tracy begins lying for happy babies pose (or dead bug); she also performs an lying straddle and reclined leg stretch. She ends seated in a full forward bend.

POWER SQUEEZE (26m)
*Warmup (1.5m)--This is a mini-version of the full warm-up; the side knee lifts are omitted.
*Power Push-Ups (2.5m)--Here Tracy performs one set of 15 push-ups on the knees followed by a set of tricep dips on the floor. She again concludes with a seated stretch for the triceps and hips.
*Standing Stretch Series (<3m)--This is the SAME segment that is included in the Full Squeeze. Although I liked this section, it felt VERY out of place here--you haven't even started working your lower body yet, so why are you stretching it out?
*Legs (1.5m)--Tracy states that she will be doing one quick set, and this definitely is quick; you use the ball and the chair for one set of dips on the toes.
*The Pretzel (4m)--This section is new to the Power Squeeze. The Pretzel is a move in which you are seated on the mat with both legs bent at 90-degrees, one in front of you, and one behind; you lift the rear leg to work you buttocks.
*Abs (5.5m)--Although this is another abs segment using the ball, it is different from the section on the Full Squeeze. Here Tracy performs more traditional crunch variations as opposed to the C-curve curls.
*Buns & Thighs (3.5m)--Again, you set up with your feet on the wall for pelvic tucks. This time, however, Tracy has the ball between her thighs, adding inner thigh work in addition to the glute and hamstring work.
*Final Stretch (3.5m)--SAME stretch as in the Full Squeeze.

CUSTOM SQUEEZE (38.5)
*Triceps (4m)--SAME as Full Squeeze
*Arms (8m)--SAME as Full Squeeze
*Seated Stretch (7m)--SAME as Full Squeeze
*The Pretzel (4m)--SAME as Power Squeeze
*The Fold Over Plank (5.5m)--This is a a segment of glutes work performed from a hands and knees (all fours) position. Tracy does mostly straight leg lifts but adds a few bent leg lifts towards the end.
*The Flat Abs (6m)--In this variation on the abs work, Tracy is lying completely flat, with one leg crossed over the other, performing small crunches that really target the lower abs. However, she moves into some scissors work that is fairly advanced.
*The Windshield Wiper Buns & Thighs (<4m)--This is another section of pelvic tilts performed with the feet on the wall. In this segment, however, Tracy adds the knees moving in and out (i.e., the ""windshield wiper"" effect) as well as some 1-legged work.

So, as you can see, this DVD provides a wide variety of options, including three different segments each of both pelvic tilts and abs work. However, I was quite disappointed that the DVD is not completely customizable. For example, I went to the ""Custom Squeeze"" menu hoping to select my own workout which would include the ""L"" segment from the Full Body Squeeze; however, as you can see from the above, the ""L"" is not included on the Custom Squeeze menu. The only way for me to select that section would be to choose the Full Body Squeeze workout option and then to skip through the chapters until I get to what I want--not very convenient! For this reason, I prefer Tracy's second DVD, Squeeze Stronger, to this one. Otherwise, I do enjoy Tracy's athletic approach to barre work and expect to get quite a bit of use from this DVD.",1273017600,24,6891,4.8645655877342415
3857997,5,B00274O8BE,"It is a big difference from what I'm used to but, once I gave it a chance it  is a good workout. Its Different but I like it. I feel soar the next day. I really like it.",1271635200,,169,3.4473684210526314

are a true inspiration to everyone!! Seeing results & will

3857999,1,B00274O8BE,"TRACY EFFINGER TOOK HER FIRST SQUEEZE WORKOUT, AND RETITLED AND REPACKAGED IT.  THIS IS NOT A NEW DVD.  FIRST I WAS CONFUSED WHEN I STARTED DOING THE VIDEO AND I KNEW EVERYTHING BEFORE SHE EVEN DID IT, THEN I REALIZED THAT SHE ALREADY RELEASED THIS DVD YEARS AGO.  SO I DID A SCENE BY SCENE COMPARISON OF THE ORIGINAL SQUEEZE AND THE 30 DAY BODY TRANSFORMATION: BEGINNING TO END, THEY ARE THE SAME EXACT MOVIE.  SAME OUTFIT, SAME MUSIC, SAME MOVES, SAME WORDS, SAME EVERYTHING.  ISN'T THIS ILLEGAL?  ALL THEY DID WAS REPACKAGE THE DVD AND RETITLE IT AND RELEASE IT LIKE IT IS NEW.  I AM GOING TO FIGHT TO RETURN IT EVEN THOUGHT I OPENED IT.",1252540800,20,640,4.372881355932203
3858000,1,B00274O8BE,"If you have a copy of the squeeze, the complete workout don't waste your money as it is exactly the same workout but they just changed the cover. I was so disappointed because i preordered and had to wait almost 2 months to find out that i had the workout already. if i had known this i wouldnt have wasted my money but i am now defintely going to return it an get a refund",1252281600,36,373,3.986666666666667
8353921,2,B00274O8BE,"The format of this dvd has Tracy working out alone.  I normally find a group more motivating.  While Tracy does smile, she simply doesn't have the personality to make doing this workout fun.  It's really more just plain work.  Some of her expressions are so de-motiving and uninspiring - such as calling a particular move ""the L from Hell"", or ""the Uncomfortable Chair.""  I mean, really!  She also instructs us to sit up on the floor ""as if you were sitting on a bed of nails.""  How can she possibly think using that kind of language makes people want to workout?  The movements are very repetitive, and boring at times.  But, to give this dvd some credit, it is definitely an effective workout.  However, since I don't find it enjoyable, I know that I won't be using this dvd very often.  I had considered giving it away to Goodwill, but have decided to hold onto it for now.  Nevertheless, I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it.  There are so many workouts available that make exercising truly fun and put a smile on your face.  I am an avid exerciser, and workout almost every day.  I need to enjoy myself working out, and I cannot do that with this dvd.",1505088000,,1161,4.514423076923077

8353923,3,B00274O8BE,"not bad, but I wasn't expecting to need so much room nor did I realize i'd need to have my feet on the wall while watching.  I don't have any walls I can use and still see the TV..",1473379200,,180,3.6153846153846154

8353925,5,B00274O8BE,"I cannot say enough good things about Squeeze and Squeeze Stronger-they are challenging,yet enjoyable and even on days I do not feel like working out,I pull them out before any of my other dvds. My only complaint is that Tracy hasn't made any recent dvds. I had heard so many great things about Physique 57,but I honestly did not enjoy them and wound up selling them. In my opinion Tracy's Squeeze dvds are so much better-they have similar moves,yet she makes them so much more pleasant. I never knew 2 or 3 pound weights could feel so darn heavy!!I have many dvds and Tracy's are at the top of my pile",1390608000,3,602,4.4324324324324325
8353926,3,B00274O8BE,"I thought this work-out was ok, not fantastic.  For me the changes between sections was distracting and it was more of an intermediate workout rather than advanced.  On the other hand, I did feel this in my obliques the next day.  I was hoping for more from this, but will be giving it away.  I can see why people like it, but it just wasn't for me.",1365292800,,349,4.164179104477612
8353927,5,B00274O8BE,"I have bought Jillian, Jackie, Mary Windsor, Yoga Booty Ballet, and many more. This is the first workout DVD I have ever done that really shows major results! Flabby arms are a family trait and I have been doing circuit training at the gym for years. After two months of doing the arm, tricep, and push-up routines at least twice a week, people are actually complimenting me on my muscle tone in my arms and asking me if I started working out. Hmmph. I've been working out forever, this is just the first time I can tell in my arms! It really burns and is quite challenging. I also have knee problems, and so I can't do all the jumping in many workout videos. This really works my legs with no impact on my knees. I am also very picky about trainers. Many of them I find so annoying that I hardly ever do the workout. Tracey seems like a real person, and she does the entire workout along with you instead of always walking around judging the form of the ""training team"" like most other videos. Some other reviewers have said that her rooftop scenes are annoying; this does not bother me at all. I am too busy trying to complete the reps! Seriously, this is an awesome DVD.",1307318400,11,1173,4.336363636363636
8353928,5,B00274O8BE,"I purchased this DVD looking for something different.  Tracy is wonderful to work out with.  She is knowledgeable, emphasizes posture, position, and what you what body area you're working on.  I love that it is low/no impact ... I do it in my bare feet.  I feel that I have gained length, flexibility and strength.  Would highly recommend to someone who doesn't want to bounce around, but does want to see results.",1306627200,3,414,4.694444444444445
8353929,5,B00274O8BE,"*NOTE:  This is the same workout as the DVD labeled Squeeze.

Squeeze is my first foray into barre type workouts.  I've been doing heavy weight workouts like P90X and Cathe's STS, as well as intense cardio.  In my quest to diversity my training, I thought I would try Squeeze.  Well, now I'm hooked!

Why I love Squeeze:

**Tracy's personality.  Her down-to-earth and encouraging words make me feel as though she's right in the room with me.

**the detailed form pointers.  When doing high rep workouts, it's all too easy to get into a trance and get sloppy with your form.  Tracey's gentle reminders come at just the right time to help me keep my form.

**the focus on posture.  I love the reminders to pull in my abs, keep neck long and shoulders back.  I work at a computer all day and tend to sit hunched over.  These posture reminders are just the thing for me.

**it's tough!  I never knew that teeny tiny 2 pound weights could cause so much muscle burn.  I always feel very worked out after doing this workout.

**the interesting set.  I like the switching between a brick-walled studio and the city rooftop.  Watching the switches distracts me from the burning of my muscles. It's fun for me to try and figure out what the roof top sign says.

**the workout versatility.  This DVD includes a 60 minute total body workout, a 30 minute Power Squeeze workout and a 38 minute Custom workout.  Both the Power Squeeze and Custom workouts include different exercises than what's in the full workout.  I will never get bored with this DVD.

**the extensive stretching sections.  Okay, I know stretching is an important part of any fitness program, but I tend to skip it.  Tracy has integrated the stretches into the workout and it's perfect.

**how I feel afterwards.  I feel worked out, relaxed, and stand taller.

My plan is to do Squeeze 3 times a week, alternating with cardio and yoga.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting a workout challenge, all while increasing flexibility.",1294444800,14,1996,4.662824207492795
8353930,5,B00274O8BE,"I just love this workout; in fact, I am online ordering a second copy for my sister as a gift. The workout is very effective--you will feel sore, and you will feel results, especially in your outer thighs and stomach/waist area. As another reviewer mentioned, this is floor/modified barre work, so it's not about aerobics or weight training, but you will be amazed at how heavy 3 pounds feels when Tracy puts you through her workout--I usually lift 10-18 lbs with my upper body, and this is still killer--in a good way!!!! I love it. Highly Recommend",1291852800,,550,4.680412371134021
