8274047,4,B0019HJYXM,Bachchan is a tough cop (aren't ALL Bollywood cops tough?) in pursuit of a charming and lovable pair of confidence tricksters. It's suspenseful but light with just enough comedy and romance to put it over. I'd watch it again.,1400889600,,225,4.794871794871795
8274048,5,B0019HJYXM,"This masterpiece has it all: great Bollywood singing and dancing, Romance, love story, buddy story, plot, spine, runaway great acting, moral, chills, joy, and a denouement that will set you tingling.

Quite simply there is nothing more to add. A great little movie

See it!

8274049,5,B0019HJYXM,"First I rented it; then I really had to buy it. It is great fun. Pick an evening when you have 3 spare hours, make a big bowl of popcorn, and put BUNTY AUR BABLI on the DVD player. Now: suspend belief. OK? You will love this movie; it is a romp. It is not meant to be taken seriously, it doesn't have a moral, but my friends, it is fun, fun, fun. It starts a little slow, but once Rakesh and Vimmi, both of whom have left home under cover of night, decide to get even with the businessman who steals Rakesh's idea and investor list, they become Bunty and Babli and it is full speed ahead. The saying `clothes make the man' is amply demonstrated here; with each costume change Bunty and Babli become totally different people. Once they figure out that life has led to love (and I liked that it took them so long to figure that out) they get married, which sets the scene for the more serious second half of the movie. First you meet ACP Dashrath Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) the police officer committed to catching Bunty/Babli; then you go to a hotel where Dashrath is having a drink in the bar, not knowing that Bunty and Babli are perpetrating yet another sting (on the owner of the hotel). This entire scene is wonderful. Bachchan Sr. and Bachchan Jr. get each other drunk and maudlin, and both flirt with, dance with, and generally lust after the bar singer (Aishwarya Rai). Fortunately Aish is fairly tall for a woman, so doesn't look silly dancing with those two tall, handsome, long-legged men (oh, that we could all be in her place). Bunty/Babli pull one more really great job, but the inevitable happens: Dashrath catches them. That's all I'm saying, as I am not going to do a spoiler. But do buy the DVD, do suspend belief, and do pass an evening watching beautiful people act their way through beautiful scenery, in beautiful costumes, all enjoying themselves to the utmost in this glorious romp.",1372204800,,1903,4.487031700288185
