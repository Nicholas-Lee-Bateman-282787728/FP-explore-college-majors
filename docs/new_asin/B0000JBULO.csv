8002379,3,B0000JBULO,"People have to keep in mind that many films from the 1930s and 1940s are in the public domain now.
Unless the film has a ""known"" name like The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, the Universal Horror films, or Disney, there's a better than 40% chance that it's public domain.
The unfortunate reality is that public domain films generally do NOT have master copies or great quality copies to create quality home video masters for VHS, DVD, let alone Blu ray.
A lot of the Lugosi films (non-Universal) fall into the public domain category and the quality of the films varies depending on best-available copies.  If you the master negative and audio reels don't exist anymore, the syndicated release copy is the best there's going to be.
The films in this collection are probably about best-condition that you could expect.  I'll have to look for The Human Monster online myself to hear the last few minutes.  They (Genius Entertainment which is defunct btw) probably screwed up the DVD master and didn't catch the audio issue until the disc went to market.  This 2-disc DVD set is STILL better than many $14-$20 SINGLE discs and you're getting four decent-quality PD films!  It certainly looks better than what I've heard of many of the Alpha Video releases.  You get what you pay for, folks...  Don't expect sub-$10 discs to be the best A/V quality you can buy!
White Zombie is probably the most memorable film in the collection BUT don't expect it to be fantastic quality.  I have the Roan Group edition which is supposedly ""best quality"" on DVD and it's STILL not fantastic.
That's just the way it is with PD films that are not looked after or cared for by a major studio film vault...",1512604800,,1684,4.646464646464646
8002380,1,B0000JBULO,"The other reviewer is right - the sound on The Human Monster ends at 1 hour, 3 minutes into the movie. I played the DVD on two different machines to make sure the problem was the DVD and not the player. I returned the DVD, and finished watching the movie (for free) on YouTube.",1316304000,,277,4.148148148148148
8002381,1,B0000JBULO,"i was given this as a present,and though that with the a.m.c. movie channel name the transfers would be at least ok,no such luck. these are the worst transfers i have ever seen. stay away from these, you can find all these movies in other collections, and they look much better. sahme on you a.m.c.",1145923200,2,298,4.4363636363636365
8002382,3,B0000JBULO,"I will not go into reviewing the content of the movies themselves, but rather the quality of the DVD.

AMC Monsterfest is a known name, so I expected a little better quality.

The video looks OK.  It is definitely watchable, but I have seen clearer transfers.

The audio in White Zombie fluctuates a little in volume.

The audio in the Ape Man is a bit muffled.

The devil Bat is the best transfer on here-both visual and audio.

The last 7 minutes or so of the Human Monster has no audio.  It just cuts out, and does not come back.  I have not seen any other version of this movie, so I am not sure if this is normal because of the age and condition of the film.

That is the major complaint with this DVD.

The creepy music on the menu screens is very cool.

For less than $10, it is probably worth it.

There are so many Bela Lugosi collections to choose from, you just don't know which are the better ones to get.  How many times are you willing to buy the same movies to find out?",1098921600,14,985,4.11578947368421
