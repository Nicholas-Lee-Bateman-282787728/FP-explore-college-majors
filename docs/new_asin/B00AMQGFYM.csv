5451449,5,B00AMQGFYM,"I bought this 2 dvd set because I wanted Brannigan mainly.  It was a movie hard to come by unless you wanted to pay a high price for it.  The second movie with Telly Savalas is good, but I am all for John Wayne movies.",1392163200,,218,3.8222222222222224
5451450,5,B00AMQGFYM,"It was one of John Wayne's last movies. I gave it a B grade, starts out kind of slow, then picks up steam. Pretty humorous at times also, plus you get a 2nd movie too.",1390003200,,167,3.8
5451451,5,B00AMQGFYM,John Wayne and Telly Savalas.  What a pair.  Good Shoot em ups.,1369612800,,63,4.166666666666667
5451452,4,B00AMQGFYM,Not only excellent movies with John Wayne being the best of course but I liked the fact each movie was on a separate DVD.  I enjoy these packet sets of 2 or more dvd movies.  Good value as well.,1361232000,5,194,3.948717948717949

5451454,5,B00AMQGFYM,"I'd had my eye on BRANNIGAN for about a year and a half (price wise) . I'd seen the film and wanted to own a copy . When i saw this ""On Demand"" set of two films on two discs , i took a chance . I ordered a Vincent Price set of five films from the same folks (TGG Direct) owing to good customer reviews . The Wayne film is shown in it's proper widescreen (2.35) aspect ratio . The print looks great . I get no subtitles or closed captions with the set but i do get a second feature from the same year (1975) . You can see the talent involved + you've got Val Quest Directing (he co-wrote as well) . KILLER FORCE comes in a full frame (1.33) aspect ratio . I've not seen that film yet . I don't get chapter selections or any features , but film playing times and disc appearance is terrific . KILLER FORCE is rated R . BRANNIGAN PG .",1356566400,10,831,3.865497076023392

8553958,2,B00AMQGFYM,"Brannigan started out promising, good cast, good production people, competent musical score but the film had a lackluster script.  There was no sense of menace from the hit man that was attempting to kill John Wayne's character; the hit man was an underused, ineffective, undeveloped and did not contribute much to the plot.  The bar room brawl sequence, one of the Duke's standard cliches in his movies was out of place in this movie and wasted time and did nothing to advance the plot of the movie.  Judy Geeson's character was wasted and should have been developed more.

Wayne's previous effort, McQ was a much better film and that was what I was hoping for in 'Brannigan' that followed up a year after 'McQ'
The characterizations of Brannigan and the supporting cast needed much more work in this film.  'Brannigan' is worth a watch but it does not stand up to repeated viewings like 'McQ' does",1433635200,,899,4.737179487179487
