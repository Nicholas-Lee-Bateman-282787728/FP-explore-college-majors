The Mormon Tabernacle Choir Olympiad Concerts
Birth of the Nations International Dance
LDS Church World Report, April 2002
Press Previews and Releases
When the World Came Here - KSL-TV Documentary
MSNBC Interview with Church Leader Gordon B. Hinckley
A Myths and Reality program produced by the Church

This is really a great DVD set, I especially love the Mormon Tabernacle Choir concerts on the DVD (Which include Call of the Champions by John Williams). I highly recommend this for anyone who has an interest in the 2002 Winter Olympics or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",1275868800,4,1018,5.017751479289941
