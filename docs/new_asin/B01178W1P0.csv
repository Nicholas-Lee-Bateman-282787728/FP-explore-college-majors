8723701,5,B01178W1P0,"Sequels are damp at best, rarely does a sequel outdo the original in any aspect, especially given the fact that the original had ended on a note where you thought all the loose ends were tied up. However the writer  Himanshu Sharma does imagine a story about life after marriage vows.
Tanu weds Manu returns is the sequel to the original and is funnier than the original. It is fresher and wittier and not just an old rehash in a new packaging.
In the original Tanu ( Kangna Ranaut) marries Manu ( Madhavan) and the movie ends. Now four years have passed and the honeymoon is long over and the chemistry fizzled. They are both at each others nerves. After a big showdown, a bitter Tanu returns home and is back at her free spirited way. Manu returns home as well but he is more weary and broken than her. One day, he meets Kusum ( Kangna Ranaut), at a sports track and he becomes smitten by her. Eventually he decides that he is going to marry her.

The Queen of the show and an performance which will be applauded for years to come, Kangna Ranaut is perfection in the double role. She is worth the price of the admission ticket. As Tanu, she adds feistiness and charm and as Kusum, an honesty, simplicity and confidence. The Haryanvi accent of Kusum was itself very melodious. Each of these roles were brimming with a talent that is far beyond what is required of a Hindi film heroine. It can be said that this is a double role that is one of the finest.
I was indifferent to Madhavan, it took guts to take this role because he could have made himself look like a joke. However, he stands remarkably restrained and respectable in a film where he was completely eclipsed by the heroine. His side kick thrives and adds the punch lines and fun at regular intervals, Deepak Dobriyal is just that.
The plot is fun dished at regular intervals and characters that are rich in quirks - that includes all insignificant ones as well. The music is ordinary but the accompanying scenes and situations are so well made that you don't mind the lack of depth.
The music is so so and perhaps the only flaw. The prequel has much better tunes.
Aanand L Rai, the director puts together this film with great care and the actors lend support to make this one of the must-see films of the year.
