3987177,4,B002U4UZQI,"I already owned Bogus and Corrina Corrina on DVD, and wasn't interested in Made in America. I just wanted Clara's Heart on DVD (already had it on VHS) and this was the only product that had it. So, I bought it. Actually, I'm glad I did -- my video cabinet is getting over-loaded so having 4 movies that fit into the space of one helps. As to the movies themselves, Whoopie does a fabulous job in all four. I just have a little problem with Ted Danson (Made in America) -- I don't particularly like his acting, but that's just my personal preference. Bottom line -- if you like Whoopie this DVD is worth owning.",1309737600,8,610,4.3130434782608695

3987179,5,B002U4UZQI,"I LOVE Whoppie Goldberg and having these four movies together is great! All of the 4 are excellent movies - ones that the whole family can enjoy. All of them involve children and their families, the modern day hardships that children experience - even though the movies are 10 years++ old - they still are relevant in what children experience. All of the movies are heart warming and very funny. My favorite is Corrina Corrina - and now that i have seen the others - they are great too. They also deal with the black/white issue - how children see it before they are jaded - how they work through it with love - not hatred. Excellent movies!",1298592000,8,641,4.440677966101695

3987185,3,B002U4UZQI,"I don't know who thought to lump these movies together, but they got it all wrong. I've been a huge Whoopi fan since her unforgetable acting debut in ""The Color Purple"". While I've been waiting for years to see ""Clara's Heart"" finally get its due and be released here in the States on DVD (thank you!!!!), why link it to these other forgetable titles?  ""Made In America"", ""Bogus""...are you kidding me? If they wanted to compile a Whoopi collection why not focus on her dramatic roles; the ones that truly compliment ""Clara's Heart"" such as ""Sarafina"" and ""The Long Walk Home"" both great and equally underrated movies. I guess ""Corrina Corrina"" falls in line, but considering Whoopi's vast catalog of films,I think the choice of movies could have been better. Luckily for us, ""Clara's Heart"" is worth the price of this collection by itself.",1267920000,27,839,4.826388888888889

3987200,1,B002U4UZQI,"Received this today (April 15, 2015) and there were multiple issues.
1.) The packaging is terrible. 3 discs stacked one on top of the other. leading to multiple scratched discs.
2.) One disc is double-sided, and looks like someone just copied the movies Bogus and Made in America straight from a television or very old VHS tape.
3.) Made in America was of such poor quality that it made me slightly motion sick because it was like the camera was swinging back and forth from left to right. (Similar to a very unsteady hand holding a camera) It also did not have any type of main menu screen and just went straight into the movie. Again, appearing to be a copy of something, and not an original movie.
4.) Clara's Heart had some serious scratches in it, so it does not look to be a new disc. I put it in the DVD player and it did begin to play, so I am hopeful that the movie will play in its entirety. I will update if it does not.

Very disappointed in this multi-DVD pack, and will not be purchasing another. I would certainly *not* recommend this to anyone.",1429056000,2,1060,4.326633165829146

I haven't seen the other movies included in this package and I'm not too sure I want to but this combo is cheaper than Made In America by itself so I might wound up buying this and watching all of the movies haha.

3987278,4,B002U4UZQI,"I buy a lot of movies off the DVD bargain rack at a nearby Ross store. One latest such bargain was a collection of four Whoopi Goldberg movies. The two DVDs were double sided with a movie on each side. They worked fine, but you have to be careful of getting fingerprints on them.

In any case, all the movies in this set were enjoyable feel-good stories with happy endings. Of course, they were humorous from place to place. My top favorites were ""Corrina, Corrina"" and ""Made in America,"" but the other two were not far behind. All were well done in the moviemaking ways. I reviewed each movie under the separate titles and my intent here is to review the package. Whoopi Goldberg is one of those Hollywood stars that has a large enthusiastic fan base and, if you're one of them, you'd like this package of DVDs. However, they're rather lightweight as movies go and if you're looking for something more serious, I'd look elsewhere.
