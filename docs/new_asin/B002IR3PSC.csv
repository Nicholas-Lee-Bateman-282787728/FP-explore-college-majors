3936742,4,B002IR3PSC,Would have gave it five stars but was disappointed that the live footage in Madison Square Garden was without John Glascock. He was ill and the band had a replacement Bassist!,1257120000,5,175,4.67741935483871
3936743,4,B002IR3PSC,"I bought this DVD for the classic and great footage of Ian doing ""Thick as a Brick"" live and wow is it sweet. Takes me back to the 1972 concert I saw them at in Tuscaloosa Alabama. They played the whole album..it was awesome especially since I had not ever heard of them or heard the music before. I've been a Tullie ever since. My only regret is that the whole concert did not make it on air...especailly the song ""My God"".
But the DVD is a keeper.",1256515200,7,449,4.113636363636363
3936744,5,B002IR3PSC,"An abridged version of this concert has been floating around on video bootleg for at least 20 years. It's my favorite Tull bootleg of the 30 or 40 I have. They were ON FIRE on this night - I consider this their best live show ever.

If you are a fan of Tull's '70s-era music, do not hesitate. Buy this. You want it. I""m amazed and delighted that they decided to give it an authorized release. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",1256428800,17,424,4.0476190476190474
3936745,5,B002IR3PSC,"This was actually the FIRST concert I ever attended.  Friends thought i was crazy when i told them it was starting at 5pm,  but i seem to remember that it was broadcast Live back to England.  Uriah Heep opened the show and it just got fantastic from there.  I've been waiting for this video footage in any format for 31 years,  Thank ""MY GOD"" it is finally here,  can't wait to relive the memories",1256342400,7,397,4.297297297297297
3936746,5,B002IR3PSC,"This long awaited release will surely satisfy any fan of Jethro Tull. Electric performance from the band at the absolute peak of their live game!  The version of ""Thick as a Brick"" featured here is the most dynamic and is my favorite video of all time, just a flawless, energetic performance of this classic. You also get the rest of the concert that was not filmed on audio, and sound quality is excellent! ""Heavy Horses"" in particular benefits from the remastering. A must have for Tull fans!",1255564800,9,494,4.67816091954023
3936747,5,B002IR3PSC,"I'm not exactly what you can say an orthodox fan of Jethro Tull, because I really don't like the poor quality sound that almost all the 60's and beggining of 70's studio versions have. Mid 70's recordings like ""Thick As A Brick"" album between others is a big exception (Thanks God!). I'm a Progressive Rock fan and that's why I'm always find myself giving me the chance to listen the productions of this band. Recently I have seen great nice surprises like the ""Jack in the Green""... I thought that after the ""A"" album and Eddie Jobson's took off for best, JT wouldn't had a great keyboardist again, but I got impressed again with keyboardist PJ Vetesse for the ""Broadsword & The Beast"" album.

After I read the inner book and saw this new JT DVD, I can say for sure that you will see the complete live version of the song ""Thick As A Brick"" between other music jems (including all the live recording problems that they had. For example the feedback whistle in the middle of the Flute solo improvization)... What a Wonderfull thing! just remember that one of the most pompus and spectacular thing of JT music is the ""BURSTING OUT"" CD (1978): My all time favorite Jethro Tull live CD recording (like the TWO FOR THE SHOW"" KANSAS album, another of my all time live favorites). So I think that this ""Live at Madison Square Garden"" is be best of the best of all the essential Jethro Tull music material. I have waited a long time to see the complete version of the ""Thick As A Brick"" song and all the great songs of the totemic ""Bursting Out"" at the period of time where all this classic Tull songs were composed at the top of their capacities; but furthermore the extraordinary drumming of the underrated player Barriemore Barlow, the great gtr sound and solos of the guitarist Martin Barre and the excellent keyboard arrangements and crazy joy of John Evan... So, at last, you will enjoy a great video of one of the best Progressive rock moments in the history of Rock music, and what will be a ""must-have"" for fans or not fans!... so Good Luck!",1255046400,7,2043,4.506738544474394

3936749,5,B002IR3PSC,"Do this: buy this set. Insert the DVD into your video player. Choose 'Track select: Opening.' Then enjoy an hour of the most exceptional Jethro Tull footage heretofore released. Ask: When have you been so richly entertained for $20? But wait, there's more: add the audio tracks that precede and follow the DVD footage, and the companion CD you get, too.

We probably have this in common: the whole CD catalog, all the video released to date, the album where the band stands up, and the one that folds out as a newspaper. If I were to select a single favorite Jethro Tull product, it may very well be the concert telecast featured on this DVD. I simply can't recommend it more highly.",1254787200,93,683,4.5528455284552845

The DVD is the complete 95 minute concert with only 50 minutes in video form and the rest of the show with photographs from the concert while the songs play live.  The CD is a 78 minute version of the concert.  Here's hoping Jethro Tull release more vintage footage in the near future.",1254096000,53,450,4.186046511627907

3936755,1,B002IR3PSC,"Who are they kidding by calling this a DVD??  Most of the songs on the DVD have ZERO video (I know, that's hard to believe).  Instead, there are still-shots?  I bought this expecting to see a video of the concert, not just a few song on DVD.  I am amazed that this was put out as it has and is advertised as a DVD.  It should be called a CD release with some bonus video.  Unfortunately, the bonus turned out to be ""bone us"".
And if you want to see Jethro Tull live today, don't go and see Ian Anderson.  He can no longer sing a lick.  He even has another singer who sings along with Ian and who even takes the lead vocals, as Anderson has ruined his voice.  So, if you want to see Jethro Tull, you will have to go and see a tribute band.  Watching Ian Anderson recently, it was like watching a cover band do Tull, as when Ian Anderson wasn't playing the flute or singing, you were essentially seeing a cover band.  The biggest difference between seeing Ian Anderson and a Jethro Tull tribute band live: The tribute band has a lead singer who can hit the notes and it doesn't charge you $100+ for the show!
Evidently, Ian Anderson did very little to preserve what was his legacy.  Even the albums of Jethro Tull have very, very poor sound quality.",1421366400,2,1247,4.215189873417722

3936758,5,B002IR3PSC,Excellent concert tape. Great camera work from several angles and the soundboard is great! All instruments well played and recorded. With Martin Barre no longer with Ian Anderson these early concerts become more rare,1388880000,,216,5.382352941176471
3936759,3,B002IR3PSC,"If they are going to only have about 50 minutes in concert footage they shouldn't charge so much for this dvd. The cheapest I can find it for is brand new for right around $24.00 with shipping included. Why on earth couldn't they have filmed the entire event???!!! Whatever the reason for only having about 6 tracks filmed isn't a good reason. I have everything of the filmed concert on other dvds except for ""No Lullaby"". I don't think I want to shell out that much money for that one track. The London Hippodrome concert on dvd kind of shortchanges the consumer but it does have 9 filmed tracks and it includes a great version of the truncated song ""Thick As A Brick"".There is really no point in buying this 1978 MSG dvd/cd combo just for the cd that accompanies it if you already have BURSTING OUT because it's very close to that set list. If this would ever get down to about 10 or 12 dollars it might be okay value for the money. I guess I could half-heartedly recommend this but just barely since you are only getting 1/4 to 1/3 of a normal concert length that would generally have about 20 to 22 tracks played.

3936762,4,B002IR3PSC,"Here you have a one hour (approximate) segment made for TV broadcast out of a longer concert by one of several truly great '70s era bands that it is sad that nobody thought to document when they were in their prime. Tull has evolved into a quieter, almost jazzy band today to accommodate Ian's greatly reduced vocal range but at their height they were phenomenal in concert - here you get a good slice of one of their shows on video - the rest of the show is there but only as AUDIO. The video starts somewhere in the middle.",1372636800,,525,4.26

3936768,4,B002IR3PSC,Most of this footage can be seen on a YouTube upload but its a good video to have in your library as one of the famous archives of great performances in rock n' roll.

3936769,4,B002IR3PSC,"I missed the ""Song From the Woods"" tour in the Fall of 1977 - but I got to see the ""Storm Watch"" tour that followed 1 year later at Madison Square Garden. Everyone loved that concert at the Garden but there was impatience because JT played too much stuff from the StormWatch album - instead - it seemed to me that everyone in the Garden wanted a complete reincarnation of the Songs From the Wood tour. I knew this because many people in the audience booed JT at the end of the concert - because J.T. played too much songs from the ""StormWatch"" album [although we would love to hear songs like Orion and King Henry's Madigral"" played today with the likes of Mr [Ms.] Palmer and John Evan around. I gambled that this DVD would capture the best of that concert I saw - songs like ""Songs from the Wood"" and ""Thick as a Brick,"" among others are all there.
If you are as old as me [50] - you can easily be sent back in time when you were a teenage Tull fan - the DVD captures Tull at its best or at least in it's Golden Renaissance.
It's too bad the DVD only features audio for the first set of songs - unfortunately it was never filmed.  At least you get the audio of these songs and a CD with the concert to boot.",1352246400,3,1209,4.10126582278481
3936770,5,B002IR3PSC,If your a true Jethro Tull fan you will enjoy this Video. It's a shame they would show only a Part of the Concert & not the Whole Concert. But what you do get to see is awesome.,1341360000,,177,3.6842105263157894
3936771,5,B002IR3PSC,"(This DVD+CD was bought at Amazon.com)  I bought this Tull DVD + CD from Amazon.com because I wanted to make sure I got it new.  Over the years I've seen Tull in concert 12 times, with 8 of them being at Madison Square Garden.  I've read where some people have complained about the sound.  But what I liked about the DVD WAS the sound.  They seem to have eliminated a lot of fan noise which made it sound better.  When you purchase a ticket to a Tull concert, it says Jethro Tull in Concert.  It doesn't say ""plus lots of annoying fans screaming and yelling.""  So that was a big plus for me.
 Overall, I liked the DVD but don't ever remember seeing that bassist as Ian said:  ""Filling in on short notice for John Glascock.  On short notice.""  Glascock had heart problems and died a short while later, unfortunately.  It bothered his friend, Barrimore Barlow so much, that he didn't want to play anymore.
 I was looking for one thing on that DVD that Tull must have done a few years earlier.  Perhaps it was in '75 or '76, they played at the Garden and right at the start of ""Cross Eyed Mary"" they used an oscilloscope on Ian Anderson while he played the opening flute solo.  It was perhaps the best thing I ever saw him do, his arms moving, his legs moving as they focused that white blinking light on him.  Then once the flute solo was over, the stage lights went back on and Ian started the vocal.  Seeing that left me stunned.  The crowd applauded.  I don't know why they haven't put that on film?
 Anyway, if you've never seen Tull in concert, this is the DVD for you.  And if you have, there are still things you'll see on the DVD that you might have missed before.  Enjoy!",1334966400,4,1678,4.273885350318471
3936772,5,B002IR3PSC,"AHHHH for a time machine.  Sadly, i don't have one. But wait, yes i do, it's my DVD player and i've just been taken back to 1978. Wow, what a buzzz, this is what i missed seeing in my youth, and belive me i'm making up for it now with this fantastic release of Jethro Tull live at Mad/Sqr garden. Worth every cent. Come on you suits lets have more of these great artist, we know you've got them.  Though, have to say, Jethro will be hard to beat.  THANKS, GREAT RELEASE.",1330905600,2,470,4.086956521739131
3936773,5,B002IR3PSC,"What strikes me most about this long-awaited release is its sound.  Even though the beginning of the video is not much visually (give 'em a break -- they didn't have anything to work with), the sound is immaculate.  The surround really does envelope the listener and the performances are stellar.  This particular band could be considered the most dangerous of all Tull line-ups.  The only thing missing is John Glascock's incredible bass playing.  Tony Williams does a great job filling in, but Glascock was a truly fantastic, innovative player.  One thing I wondered was how, at sucn short notice, Williams was able to learn Tull's complex material.  Anyway, on to the visual.

Ian Anderson was clearly playing to the camera, with his stage antics more frenetic than usual.  The band was in top form, though and, to be fair, Anderson's flute playing was nothing short of incredible, particularly during his solo.  Barriemore Barlow's performance was also show-stopping.  I only wish there had been more time for him to show off some of the more unorthodox equipment as he did in ""Velvet Green"" from the Sight and Sound performance from a few years earlier.  John Evans' stage antics were also pretty ""out there,"" but again, like Anderson, his playing was beyond reproach.  Between his and David Palmer's playing, their sound was heavenly.  I wish Tull could've employed two keyboard players in subsequent line-ups.  As good as all those players were, it was nice to have that ""fat"" sound that Evans and Palmer brought to the proceedings, thus bolstering all the majestic sounds going on around them.  And, of course, Martin Barre's playing was nothing short of excellent.

I liked the song selection, particularly ""No Lullaby"" from Heavy Horses.  It was a most unorthodox choice done to great effect.  The opening with the 11-plus minute ""Thiok as a Brick"" was also quite the unusual opener.  One could tell they were feeling a little rushed, but they managed to squeeze in as many songs as they could in the time allotted.  ""Songs From the Wood"" was another inspired choice.

The ""after broadcast"" section was also very interesting.  I'm sure the audience wondered what was going on with the repetition of ""Locomotive Breath,"" but the band came through with flying colors all around, so it would be difficult for me to believe that that audience would walk out of Madison Square Garden disappointed.  I'm really glad this show was released.  It bears similarities to Bursting Out, the live album they had out at the time, but the uniqueness of the circumstances made it essential, in my opinion.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wanted to see a truly great live band at the absolute top of their game.",1329264000,7,2716,4.901315789473684
3936774,4,B002IR3PSC,"Debera darle menos estrellas al DVD porque de los 95 minutos slo 50 son video, al comienzo y al final son imagenes mientras oyes los temas. Adems las tomas de videos no son buenas, en muchos casos ocupan slo una parte de la pantalla. (El sonido excelente pero las imagenes no)

El grupo toca muy bien, francamente bien, es un buen concierto y representativo de su poca dorada con la miembros clsicos de la banda. Se parace mucho al ""2LP Bursting Out"" pero aqui es mas corto.

Si eres fan debes comprarlo aunque sea slo por verles tocar Thick as a brick, Songs from the wood y otros temas clsicos de los 70.

Este junto con el DVD de la Isla de Wight son los nicos publicados de su primera poca (antes de los 80).  Deba ser complicado grabar los conciertos !!. CDs piratas de los 70 hay bastantes pero DVD no.",1316649600,,808,4.296052631578948
3936775,4,B002IR3PSC,"This DVD/CD package is an absolute must have for any Jethro Tull fan; finally a concert DVD from the classic 1970s period and the closest thing possible to having a video version of Tull's seminal live album `Bursting Out.'
The set comes in a fantastic shiny Digipak containing a booklet with photos and linear notes from Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson himself as well as manager Terry Ellis.

Now for the interesting part; the original broadcast only features 50 minutes of recorded footage, but Jethro Tull played an hour and a half long concert so the cd contains a 78 minute long version of the concert (with all the dead air and segments without music edited out) while the DVD contains the full video concert, plus seven audio only bonus tracks and you can choose to either `play all,' or `play video only.' Perhaps this was an inelegant solution but considering the fact that the rest of the concert wasn't filmed it seems to me the best solution available given the circumstances.

It also seems pertinent to mention that there are a few visual hiccups and one audio problem owing to the nature of the very old satellite broadcast from which the concert is taken but this are few and far between, easily forgivable and do not hamper your overall enjoyment of the show. The people putting the DVD together took every care to restore as much of the concert to as high a standard as possible without damaging the music and it shows.

Now with all that out of the way, it seems about time to discuss the concert. And what a concert it is, `On Fire,' scarcely describes just how energetic and captivating the Tull performance is, bringing the songs to life in ways the album versions hint at, adding proggy intros to `Sweet Dream,' and `Songs From The Wood,' and sticking extended jam sessions to the end of `No Lullaby,' and `Locomotive Breath,' and adding a flair and energy to every single piece that justifies why fans have been crying out for live material from this era for so long. The band even have two uncredited jam sessions including a `Conundrum,' style piece with full Drum solo after the first performance of `Locomotive Breath,' and `God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,' with a full band jam session after `No Lullaby.'

Ian's voice is magnificent and he rips through different styles from the soft `One Brown Mouse,' to the deep `My God,' with no trouble at all, and special mention must go to the absolutely storming rendition of `Thick as a Brick,' which is absolutely gigantic, if you had your doubts about the DVD they'll have been erased by the time the drums kick in.

That's not to say that Ian is the only one going above and beyond the call of duty, Martin Barre absolutely murders his guitar during the solos on `No Lullaby,' `Aqualung,' and `Locomotive Breathe,' while Barriemore Barlow rolls and flails his way across the drum kit like a madman at times, while always maintaining a precise and complicated beat that'd leave many other drummers scratching their heads.

When I first saw this package I was worried it would be some poor quality bootleg slapped together with compressed audio, blurry pixilated video and a terrible box and as it turns out nothing could be further from the truth, this is a fantastic package with excellently mixed audio (really clear mix, all elements be they guitar leads, kick drum, piano, xylophone or Mr. Anderson vocals are audible and either clear or punchy where appropriate) as great a job on the video as could be done with the source material (It looks better on my HDTV than even some of the stuff on Tull's `Jack in the Green,' and all of their `Slipstream,' DVDs) and a classy Digipak style box to house it all in.

Best of all; the CD/DVD package isn't going for a stupid high price either, so if you want a Jethro Tull DVD from the 70s you can sigh in relief knowing you won't be ripped off either monetarily or in terms of quality.",1311552000,5,3906,4.643994211287988

I have seen most of the other DVDs from J Tull and there is almost nothing new in these videos so for me only 8% of the material was new concert video-wise.
On top of that the two very amazing songs ""Heavy Horses"" and ""One Brown Mouse"" were disappointingly not video. This is a very strange DVD that begins with two ""Audio Only Songs"", and then goes into 8 Videos, whch again is followed by three Audio Only songs. Then after that is the CD with 11 songs.

3936780,5,B002IR3PSC,"This video captures a very good Tull performance; super-good version of early- and mid-seventies classics, which is always a pleasure to see, since the ""Living with the Past"" (LWTP) DVD has a mediocre sound and way-too-cheesy video editing for being released after the year 2000. The Live @ Montreux DVD and the AVO Sessions DVD are far better than LWTP. So if you are looking for digital recoding-quality video, and don't care about Ian's voice, I'd recommend those two with emphasis on the latter.
The sound and picture of ""Jethro Tull: Live at Madison Square Garden 1978"" are very good for the time it was recorded. Don't expect digital quality because of course this was recorded on analog equipment.
A must have for every Jethro Tull fan.
I'm so looking forward for the official release of the Tampa Stadium 1976 and the London Hippodrome 1977 which share similar video and audio quality than this video who has been circulating before on bootlegging circles for quite a while.",1293667200,4,982,4.88622754491018
3936781,5,B002IR3PSC,"English prog rockers Jethro Tull's live CD and DVD Live at Madison Square Garden 1978 is a must for Jethro Tull fans.
This CD and DVD combo pack was recorded on the US leg of the 1978 Heavy Horses album while also promoting its first proper double live album Bursting Out. Like Bursting Out, Jethro Tull Live at Madison Square Garden 1978 captures the lineup of lead singer/songwriter and flute player Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, keyboard player John Evan, drummer Barriemore Barlow, orchestrator/keyboard player David Palmer (now known as Dee Palmer) and bass player Tony Williams who was filling in for the late John Glascock who was ill.
The DVD has the entire October 9, 1978 performance's audio although some of the tracks have photos as the BBC didn't film a number of songs while the CD that comes with this has all of the tunes sans the final encore and stage bantering.
We begin with a unique Introduction which segues into a killer version of ""Sweet Dream"" which rocks alot harder than the studio version and Bursting Out versions. We then jump to the Heavy Horses album for the acoustic ""One Brown Mouse"" and Heavy Horses' title cut (which was inexplicably missing from Bursting Out). We then have the excellent but condensed version of ""Thick As A Brick"" which first appeared on the remastered Thick as a Brick remastered CD from 1997 (the live concert footage on film starts with this track on the DVD). Next is a rocking version of the Heavy Horses album track ""No Lullaby"" which is a superb version which includes a superb Ian Anderson flute solo. Then we have a little keyboard improv which segues into a stellar version of ""Songs From the Wood"".
Then comes the band intros (not on the CD) which then leads into a shortened version of the Bursting Out instrumental ""Quatrain"" which is driven by a killer riff by Barre that segues into a phenomenal version of the title track to 1971's Aqualung. We then have a classic version of ""Locomotive Breath"" which just rocks. Then it goes into ""The Dambusters March"" which gives way into an instrumental which rocks before going into another ""Conundrum"" type instrumental (the film footage ends midway through the song) with a phenomenal drum solo from Barriemore Barlow. Then we have an excellent version of ""Too Old to Rock and Roll Too Young to Die"" and a stellar medley of ""My God""/""Cross Eyed Mary"" (which ends the CD). Then the band does another rendition of ""Locomotive Breath"" which is similar to the version found on Bursting Out with the reprise of ""Aqualung"" at the end.
Jethro Tull Live at Madison Square Garden 1978 is a great companion to Bursting Out and is great to compare and contrats the versions found here and on Bursting Out.

3936783,4,B002IR3PSC,"Wow, I couldn't wait to see this show.  After I opened the box and placed the DVD in the player this wonderful concert began much to my expectations.  Considering the age of the venue and the technology of its time the audio and video was very good.  I saw Jethro Tull three years earlier in Columbia, SC with the Amazing Alex Harvey Band opening for them.  Other than Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond departing the group the members were the same!  I highly recommend this DVD to others especially to those who enjoy seeing Ian Anderson up close and working the crowd.  Martin Barre rocked, John Evan was his comical self while demonstrating his keyboard mastery and Barrimore Barlow was tightly keeping tempo. This concert had a session bassist (Tony) filling in for Gordon Glascock who was in poor health at that time.  The shipping was efficently done and the condtion of the DVD represented what was advertised.",1281744000,3,907,4.812903225806451
3936784,3,B002IR3PSC,"This DVD seems to me a like big disappointment.

The set list for the MSG concert lacks momentum, focus and the coherence that we have come to expect in a great live recording from any artist or band as ambitious as Jethro Tull . The performance is fragmentary, rushed, and without the precise attention to details that is almost a mandatory value in the music of other great live acts, such as Zappa (Plays Zappa), Gabriel, or Yes.  All the brilliant arrangements from ""Aqualung"", ""Heavy Horses"" or ""Thick as a Brick"" have been compressed in a ""less demanding"" heavy-rocking-grey sound that is more characteristic of a ""little ol' band from Blackpool"" than from the creators of ""A Passion Play"". And even though they were on tour all the time, the music on this DVD sounds everything but effortless or related to experienced musicians: pain, sweat and Ian Anderson's monochromatic voice are in full command of the stage ( although nothing anticipates the HORROR of the years to come: Anderson's infamous throat problem.)

  The inclusion of ""Quatrain"" and an anonymous jig -two mere fillers- remains a mysterious decision hard to understand when we consider how extensive and varied the Jethro Tull catalog was by the end of the seventies. ""Bungle in the Jungle"" or ""A New Day Yesterday"" would have been a more predictable but better choice. And if we accept the fact that the image of Ian Anderson approaching the audience with a tambourine in hand during an epic instrumental break is still a memorable scene, then...

...then we'll do well to remember (and accept the fact) that it's also a very old one: it was first released on a video, for the benefit of a legion of Tullies, some twenty years ago.",1277424000,2,1705,4.802047781569966

This band has it going on on all fronts--songwriting, talent, energy, enthusiasm and showmanship. The torture here comes in two ways: first, the beginning and ending of the show being a still-photo slideshow rather than the concert and second, the brevity of the whole thing. Tull's shows that year were two hours and then some, so this one just gets you warmed up before ending--such sweet sorrow. At this point in the band's history they had the confidence that comes with a long history of success but they were still having (obviously) so much fun. They remained a great live band after this, of course, but for me they were never better than the few years surrounding this tour.

3936797,4,B002IR3PSC,"As a life long fan and having seen them numerous times dating back to the early 70's, this concert DVD/CD combo is a pretty good representation of what the concerts looked and sounded like back then.  I think it's more of interesting look at the group at the time and the state of technology and television at the time.  There is only 50 minutes of video, so the DVD part is quite limited by the television show it was appearing on in the UK.  As for the CD part, it is very similar to ""Bursting Out"", so musically it is nothing new or different.  For the long time fans who long for those days when the first chords of Aqualung, Cross eyed Mary and Locomotive Breath would bring an entire arena to its feet, this brings back some good memories.  For those newer fans, it is a good sampler of what it was like when they were at their peak. I just wish someone had videotaped the entire concert.",1259712000,5,894,4.266272189349112

Included is 2nd CD of the same songs on DVD.  Little odd.  Audio only on Sweet Dream, the very hip, One Brown Mouse followed by over-rated Heavy Horses. Broadcast video begins with classic Thick as a Brick.  Unfortunately, after an hour, video ends during Locomotive Breath!  Hello?

Audio only for Too Old to Rock and Roll, My God and Cross Eyed Mary.  Interesting for a couple of reasons:  this was a very early satellite broadcast so time ran out during the concert.  Tony Williams filled in short notice for John Glascok on Bass and finally, Uriah Heep opened this show!  Would be nice to see the whole concert.  Better option is Tull's Isle of Wight.  That's classic!",1259280000,7,833,4.510067114093959
3936801,3,B002IR3PSC,"First of all, since there is a companion CD, I can't see the point of including stand-alone audio of several tracks on the concert DVD. Just for the pictures? No point.

Second, the absence of John Glascock has a negative effect over-all. He was Tull's most accomplished bassist and was a great presence on stage. Tony Williams does a fine job, but it's just not the same for this dyed-in-the-wool Tuller.

I was greatly looking forward to seeing No Lullaby performed, but the performance here is nowhere near as good as the one on Bursting Out. The flute break, however, is the highlight of the whole show.

I guess I am getting tired of the same songs being hashed out over and over and over: Aqualung and Locomotive Breath in particular. Great songs, but with such a vast catalog this fixation on a few hit tunes does a disservice to Tull's work as a whole. I realize this was 1978, and also that they needed to cater to concert-goers who were paying to see these songs, but still, from the perspective of 2009, I guess I'm a bit jaded.

have to take speed before he started to edit video??  It is like he isn't showing his value if he is not
blending camera images, and switching cameras at 1 ever 3 seconds!  God, I hate that!!

It really degrades the performance because all we really want is to ""Feel like we are there"", but
give us a ""Good seat"", know the damn music so you know when to switch to lead guitar, drums, Tull.

It seems like the editor is some jackass from Cablevision that did the mixing because CV owns MSG??
This would make him the same dude that does camera coverage for the hockey games.  OK, yes, there
you are switching angles every 3 500 milliseconds, but not for a concert.

Great concert. Normally when the video editing is this bad I pass.  But when it is one of my Fav's
I have to live with it.  I wouldn't hire this editor to edit my kids sweet 16 video.  Jackass!

3936806,4,B002IR3PSC,"During the early 70s, Tull concerts were a curious, explosive mix of heavy flute-driven blues rock, jazz influenced classical folk.... and comedy! kind of a rock concert-meets-circus, featuring non-rabbits, firemen, zebras, gorillas taking pictures of the audience, weather reports - at one point Anderson stopped the music during a ferocious hard rock passage to answer an on-stage ""Tull-a-phone"". As the music started again, without missing a beat, a soaking wet aqualung-clad scuba diver flapped across the stage in flippers to take the call. You never knew what would happen next... the shows were clever and funny, but the musicians were serious and rocked like no others - in my opinion, for a few years Jethro Tull was the most entertaining live rock band in the world. Throughout the early 70s they would come to town every summer on their US tours (Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Passion Play, Warchild) and my high school friends and I looked forward to these concerts for months.

Now fast-forward a few years - to 1978 when this DVD was filmed. Many have stated that the ""Heavy Horses"" era was Tull's musical peak. I disagree. I think they had long since peaked and were by this point running out of ideas - so in the absence of strong new material they concentrated on honing and polishing their live performances to a note-perfect delivery of their repertoire. But the ""surprise"" factor - the creativity, humor and sheer wild-rock abandon that made their concerts such incredible experiences in earlier years - were all but gone. Still, it will be clear to anyone watching this DVD that Jethro Tull still put on an amazing performance in 1978, still peerless musicians in the rock arena.

I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD; Tull were as much fun to watch as they were to listen to. Maestro Anderson essentially conducts the group with his flute, leaping, twirling, spinning in perfect time with the music. But he's a camera magnet and the focus is almost exclusively on him while so much else is going on - like guitarist extraordinaire Martin Barre leaping onto the stage extension to riff it up during Locomotive Breath.

It's really only during the last few minutes of the show, as the balloons are heaved into the audience, that we get a glimpse of the old Tull energy - rocking out as John Evans, the group clown, abandons his organ to dive about and play air guitar.

Anderson wisely recorded a live album (Bursting Out) and filmed this concert in this same year because he knew the downhill slide was gaining speed and the end of their era was looming - already being labeled ""dinosaurs"" by the rock press, the ""big tent"" was about to come down. Two years later only Anderson and Barre remained to carry on the Tull name, and the glory days were over.

At the beginning of the show it was announced (I don't remember by whom) that the show was being broadcast in England and I thought, ""Great, it's GOT to be a good show.""  I was wrong.  The set list was okay but the whole show was an hour long, no encores, AND for some reason they did Aqualung twice!
Those tickets must have cost me 6, maybe 8 dollars, times two for my girlfriend, plus train fare and a couple of joints, comes to a total of about 20 bucks.

Large sports venues like MSG, were acoustically challenged, and still are to this day, yet is not an issue, surprisingly, with this technically well engineered DVD. You can hear every note, chord, and drum beat, with  exceptional clarity. This rare VISUAL look at Jethro Tull, performing as this group of musicians, is a ""Classic Event"".

3936810,4,B002IR3PSC,"This was another ""Holy Grail"" concert I'd waited on for three decades to come out.  It's pretty much a complete show from their 1978 tour.  Even Barrie's drum solo is here  ( CD and DVD, although sans video on the latter ).  Picture quality is decent, especially considering the technology of the video cameras of the seventies, and somewhat inadequate stage lighting for shooting a rock concert.  Ian Anderson is his usual witty, frustrated comedian self...if I have a complaint, it's that I wish the director had spent ten percent more time doing shots of the band members  ( and ten percent less of Mr. ""mug for the camera"" Anderson, much as I love the guy! ).  Jethro Tull have always been one serious band live, and this concert is no exception!  I saw them twice during the seventies, and left both times in awe of their musical prowess.

The most pleasant surprise was that they actually went to the trouble to mix the multi-track audio from the original tapes, and synched it up with the video!  Two-inch VTRs weren't designed with stereo sound in mind, and only had one 'primary' and 'secondary' audio track...hence most seventies concert footage has only monaural audio.  It was relatively rare for them to bother with having a separate remote audio truck on site along with a video truck  ( Led Zeppelin apparently routinely did this every time they did location shooting, but they were more the exception to the rule ). Ironically, having gone to that effort, it's even more rare that, in releasing a seventies concert today, a producer would even bother to track down the multi-track audio tapes of a videotaped or filmed show.

Disappointing that there is only fifty minutes of actual video footage from MSG...apparently there was no video truck at the arena  ( although they had a twenty-four track location audio truck on site; go figure! ).  The video was most likely captured by the BBC from the satellite transmission...and we can be thankful for them archiving it all these years.  It's easy to forget how expensive videotaping a show was, thirty-plus years ago, on tape that cost approximately three hundred dollars a reel in 1978.  I'd have preferred just the fifty minute portion on the DVD itself, accompanied by the full CD of the audio.  But all in all, a good DVD.

The DVD is a 50 minutes video footage from the groundbreaking international TV broadcast, which transmitted the high performance of a superlative band in their apogee at the Madison Square Garden in october, 9th, 1978.
The gig starts with the concert recording (beginning only audio) of the songs: 1) Sweet Dreams (a powerful orchestral music), 2) One Brown Mouse (minstrel, kind medieavel with rock) and Heavy Horses (a classical refugee), suddenly starts the broadcast with the classical suite ""Thick as brick"" (from their eponymous conceptual album, whose story claims to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by the fictional 8-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, or Little Milton, a poem writen by a premature english boy talking about the challenges to grow up, though the music and lyrics were actually written by the band's frontman, Ian Anderson and arranged with the contribution of all band members an so, in a matter of fact, is regarded as a classic of progressive rock) impeccable well played; then we have the beauty of ""No Lullaby"", light and sometimes fierce with a magnificent flute solo; after comes ""Songs from the Wood"", a real minstrel song mixed with rock, ""Quatrain"", a band prelude to the next one the majestic  ""Aqualung"", followed by the iron-sizzling-steam-rolling-thunder of ""Locomotive Breath"" incorporating ""Dambusters March"" and ended the broadcast, but not the show, following this songs: ""Too Young to rock'n'roll, too Young to die"" (sublime music, for the love of God), and then My God (a profound and mysterious song) intercalating with the striking ""Cross-eyed Mary"" (Iron Maiden played a version in the bootleg British Thunder), and to finish we have an encore of ""Locomotive Breath (inc. Dambusters March)"".
The show is one of the best I've ever seen, the songs are heavier, stronger, with that development that features the progressive rock sound of Jethro Tull, a blend of minstrel/mediaevel/folk and classical elements. besides rock, of course.
The pack also contains a CD version concert (78 minutes), and even less songs than ""Bursting Out"", nevertheless, this event is more vibrating, heavier and full of magical presence of Ian Anderson (vocals, flute, acoustic guitar) and the entire group: Martin Barre- electric guitar, John Evan - piano, organ, synthesisers, Barrimore Barlow- drums, glockenspiel, David Palmer - portative pipe organ, synthesisers and Tony Williams- bass guitar.
