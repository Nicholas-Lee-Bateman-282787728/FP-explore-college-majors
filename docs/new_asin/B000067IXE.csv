7962939,2,B000067IXE,"Obvious spoof of the gameshow that kind of came and went as a pop culture icon. If you're used to Seduction Cinema product's, you may be disappointed, as the concept and production here are pretty pedestrian; a cheesy tv set and not the usual vain attempts at storytelling you get from them. A couple of the girls are hot (especially Julian), the girl/girl stuff occasionally rises above Skin-a-max level (not enough pink, unfortunately), and I find Julian Wells to be one of their best attresses. She is not a silicone sex bomb, but she's attractive, blonde, seems bright and is game in attempting to pull off their lame attempts at comedy. Spider-Babe is a better Wells flick, and you get to see her with Misty Mundae, who's always a 10 on the peter-meter!",1142380800,,758,4.706766917293233
7962940,3,B000067IXE,"An obvious spoof of the popular game show, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, this take features a slew of sexy female contestants answering their questions in order to win not only a billion dollars, but also lots of erotic fun with sexy host Remis Phildin and co-hostess Bambi.",1131408000,,275,4.63265306122449
7962941,3,B000067IXE,"Who Wants to be an Erotic Billionaire? almost surely has the smallest budget of any movie Seduction Cinema has released.  In this spoof of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, you have four contestants-two girls and two guys-competing for a chance to get into the hot seat opposite host Remis Phildin.  Actually, the hot seat is just a plain old chair much like the one Remis sits in as she reads the questions (which are on cheap little cards).  Over to the side, you have Bambi; for each answer a contestant gets right, Bambi removes a piece of clothing.  Get all nine answers correct, and you basically win Bambi (and a billion dollars, although everyone cares more about Bambi than the money).  The girl contestants have no problem, fielding less than challenging questions such as ""What is your favorite color?""  For the guy contestants (one of whom lives with his brother ""in a van down by the river""-an obviously humorous reference to Chris Farley's Matt Foley character on Saturday Night Live), it's a different story altogether, as they get incredibly obscure questions that no one on earth could figure out.  Throughout the ""show,"" Remis makes one bad joke after another, and she actually seems to be slightly embarrassed about some of the stupid lines she was given.  There are also some completely silly advertisements thrown in after each contestant finishes a round, but these crude ads really aren't very funny, in my opinion.
This movie is probably a little funnier than most Seduction Cinema releases, but overall it never reaches its full potential.  The actresses are OK but certainly not representatives of John Bacchus' A-list (i.e., much more attractive) performers.  In the end, the good and bad basically cancel each other out, resulting in a movie that left me rather nonplussed and just a little bit disappointed.",1045872000,9,1833,4.941368078175896
