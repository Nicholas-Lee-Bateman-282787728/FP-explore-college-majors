1708109,5,B000065U6I,"My daughter actually wakes me up in the morning, asking to do yoga.  This video makes it so much fun for her, and it's a perfect beginners workout for me.  All of the poses are done in a way that kids can make believe, and get some excercise at the same time.  My five-year-old's favorite is ""the butterfly"", she pretends she's flying around looking for flowers.  This is great for someone like me because I have no motivation to work out whatsoever, but my daughter encourages it.  This is the first workout video I've ever seen that actually makes it fun for kids and adults alike.",1085443200,4,583,4.462264150943396
1708110,5,B000065U6I,I bought this DVD for something to do with my 4 year-old Daughter while her brother is at school.  I turned it on for both of the kids while I was doing laundry one afternoon.  The giggles that were coming from the room were worth every penny I paid for the DVD.  My daughter and I love doing this together.  It is geared for kids but fun for grown-ups too.  This is not a serious yoga workout but for the poses and an introduction to Yoga it is GREAT!,1074643200,3,452,4.033707865168539
1708111,5,B000065U6I,"I bought ""Yoga for the Kid in All of Us"" on a whim and, after using it once, my five-year-old son begs to ""do yoga"" with me every day!  One of the nicest things about this program is that it's for kids and their parents to do together (though a child or parent could do it on their own).  The ""yoga dude"" who introduces and explains the poses (you mostly see a mom or dad and a kid actually doing the poses) is just zany enough to amuse kids, but not so wacky as to annoy parents.  The music is terrific; the pacing is just right.  I look forward to more DVD's from this studio.",1043107200,23,578,4.0
1708112,5,B000065U6I,"I've been looking for a video like this for a long time and now I have it...a yoga video that is fun and interactive that I can do with my children. Chaz (the YOGAmazing dude) is captivating, warm, funny and great talent for bringing yoga to the parents and kids. His instructions are excellent and informative. It's like watching Blues Clues and doing yoga all at the same time. My children look forward to watching this video especially when the toes talk to each other.",1038700800,37,472,4.564705882352941
1708133,4,B000065U6I,"I bought this video to introduce yoga to my son and he enjoyed the video. I found it a little slow and somewhat distracting (I am used to a more quiet environment during yoga) but my son liked it and the distractions were a form of entertainment for him. He talked about it for days after. All in all, I was satisfied but I will keep searching for a shorter (yes it was extremely long) more structured video.",1213315200,,408,4.243589743589744
1708134,5,B000065U6I,"I got this video mainly for my 4 year old daughter. We borrowed it from the library and she loved it so much we had to buy it. Whenever Gabby is feeling too restless & giddy, I pop this in & we do a few movements. My 2 year old son also has fun TRYING the poses! Of course, the lion is the favorite!",1163030400,,299,3.6875
1708135,5,B000065U6I,"My kids began doing yoga in PE class at school this past year--about the same time I began doing yoga. Many yoga DVDs are just above kid level (ability and interest-wise) unless the child has been doing yoga for awhile. I can see kids loving this--the breaks are humorous and allow kids a breather. It's a fun way to get children to exercise and to learn yoga poses. Of course they will move past this level in time, but it's a nice way to maintain their interest. I can see kids up through 2nd grade (and even into 3rd) enjoying this video. I also recommend Yoga Fitness for Kids ages 7-12 with Leah Kalish for elementary school age students--it's for kids but more serious while being fun, and seeing children their age (and older) doing the poses (and struggling with them, sometimes, too!) helps their self-esteem.",1153440000,3,818,4.609589041095891
1708136,4,B000065U6I,"i just bought this tape two days ago and my 2 year old loves it.  she has asked for it these two days in a row.  we started doing yoga recently with a class, however it isn't always that convenient to get to so i wanted to try a dvd.  since she is young it was really hard to pick.  but i am very glad i purchased this one.

if you have an older child who does yoga with flowing ansanas (please forgive me if that is not the right word) then this dvd is not for you.  you want something more advanced.  i use the yoga zone dvd's for myself and love them.  this one is a great way to introduce traditional yoga poses to your child, even if the child is older.  yes there is a lot of stop start to it, but a novice will get the jist and you can move on later.  as for my 2 yo, like i said she loves it...she may not be able to do the poses 100% but she will be some day.  and as she gets older she can do more flowing yoga.

i recommend this to all beginners from 2 - 10.",1146700800,2,969,3.696078431372549
1708137,5,B000065U6I,"This is a great video for all: Parents and teachers. Kids of all ages luv it. Humourous, interesting and informative!! Highly recommended. A must have!",1141257600,,151,5.08
1708138,5,B000065U6I,"This is a great DVD for kids!  I am a physical therapist for a school district, and I have used this with many of my students as well as my 3 year old daughter.  They all love it!  It is somewhat slow paced, but kids need a little extra time to transition in and out of the many positions, as well as a little help the first few times through to help their bodies learn where they are supposed to be.  I would recommend this DVD highly, and I now have many other teachers interested in buying this for their classrooms.  I have used it from preschool age up to 6th graders, and all seem to enjoy it.",1138838400,5,599,4.0423728813559325
1708139,5,B000065U6I,"I am a Special Education Teacher.  I used this video twice weekly last school year with my classroom of 9 kids with disabilities.  We now use the same poses everyday with my kids (mostly with Autism) but the kids know it so well we don't need the video anymore!  I think this is a great structured way to do Yoga with kids with special needs.  I love the visual introduction of each pose.  I also really like the kid/adult pairs to show each pose.  It is very simple and straight forward.  I highly recommend this for anyone to do with their own child or a small group of children, with or without disabilities!",1097798400,16,611,4.353982300884955
1708140,5,B000065U6I,"In a nutshell, this is a wonderful DVD for basic stretching, and it has the added bonus of being appealing to children as well.  If you're not too self-conscious, you can have a lot of fun (even if the kids aren't around!), and I found that it's a really nice start to a hectic day, for both myself and my children.

Each stance is introduced in a charming and child-captivating way.  The stances are primarily linked to animals (e.g. the cat/cow, the cobra, the lion), and my son loves making the noises.

I am not heavily into yoga, and I think the serious practitioner would probably find these stances too simple.  They are not held for a long time, which may also be an issue for a hard-core yoga practitioner, but it's great for a small child, and a beginner.  A few stances will be tricky for younger children, but I find my two-year-old is happy to make a close approximation, and I think it will be a lot of fun watching his form improve over time.

The DVD is nice and long (45-60 minutes, depending on what you skip).  If your child doesn't have that much patience, or your schedule that much room, the clean chapter divisions make it easy to pick up where you left off.  Since the stances aren't too hard, you don't need much warm-up time.

Overall, I am thrilled with this DVD and wish there were more of them.  I've looked at other child/yoga DVD's, and don't think any can hold a candle to this one for simplicity, fun without being condescending, and child/mom/dad appeal.",1093651200,8,1488,4.474074074074074
1708141,2,B000065U6I,"I read all these great reviews and must admit I was REALLY disappointed.  I thought it would be a yoga dvd I could do with my child and she could have fun while I got at leaset a little of my workout in.  WRONG.  It is more like a visual encyclopedia of kid ""yoga"" poses.  The yoga guy talks about the pose and ""kid chats"" a bunch, but RARELY is the one demonstrating the poses. I do not want to suffer though it again for an exact quote but basically he says things like ""Camel pose is great, do you want to be a camel???  Camels this and camels that, bla bla bla camels"".  The whole while sitting there looking at you not doing the pose he is talking about and just talking while looking at the camara.  Not even telling you what to actually do, just talking up the virtues and fun of the next pose.  I would give it a 5 if it were a 2 part dvd with an actual yoga routen you could do that put all these poses together.  The host talks longer than you do the pose it felt like.  Definately not a break a sweat or high energy dvd.  LOTS of down time and chatter with NO flow or routen.  It will not remain on my shelf.  If you are looking for a DVD with tons of talk and lots of gaps between movement than this is the one for you.",1090108800,54,1231,3.9153225806451615
7961352,5,B000065U6I,Best yoga tape around for the young school age kids for a spare moment of pe',1480550400,,77,3.875
7961353,5,B000065U6I,great! you can pick the pose you want and only do those poses on the DVD.,1474761600,,73,3.625
7961354,2,B000065U6I,"I had high hopes, maybe it is just my kids. They will sit for about 5 minutes, but get bored. They are 4 and 2 years old, so maybe they are too young. They will follow me when I do mine (but not for long either). I had hoped that this would have an entertaining angle, beyond just imitating me. Maybe next year?",1387324800,,311,3.9523809523809526
7961355,5,B000065U6I,"I bought this video so that I could do yoga with my three year old grand daughter. She and I loved it right away and we are still using it together and she is now eight. It makes yoga fun and interesting for kids and yet I get a great yoga workout, too. We still laugh at the toes talking after all these years.
I taught yoga to seniors for nine years and started my grandchild on yoga at age one. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to pass on the joy and peace of yoga to their children or grandchildren.
Oh, I had intended to purchase the DVD, but was able to copy the VHS tape to DVD so that we can use it.",1377475200,,617,3.8661417322834644
7961356,5,B000065U6I,"A great way to introduce the basic poses of yoga for anyone, at any age.  Kids will enjoy the animal references along the way and adults will appreciate the slow, gentle pace.  It also helps to discover your flexability level and you'd be amazed at how much you can already do.  Great for Mommy & Me bonding time or for kids to do on their own for relaxation and self control.",1369008000,,376,4.267605633802817
7961357,5,B000065U6I,"Not to hard for the parents either.  We all do it and its fairly simple stuff.  Parents will get a nice stretch in.  Kids have a blast following along making the animal poses.  It plays fast music at the beginning of each pose to tell about the pose and catch the kids interest again.  Its hard to keep my 3-4 year old at it for the entire hour but he tries.  Sometimes he gets distracted but comes back.  He has picked his favorite poses (fountain & jumping like a kangaroo & childs pose).  Just fun to do together because he enjoys it so much.  On top of that, me and my husband are both on the heavy side and we can still do it no problems, so its something fun to do as a family (and feels great to stretch out my aching back).  Not very serious or intensive.  Kind of a yoga introduction to get him interested.  As he gets older I will prob switch up to something different.",1365120000,,879,4.105882352941176
7961358,5,B000065U6I,"This is definitely geared towards little ones and I think the packaging and description make that known, so I don't really understand the negative reviews because it wasn't intense enough for the parent...that would really be challenging for the young Yogis.

My kids will practice the entire video, an hour long and it's a lot of fun interactive stuff like the wheelbarrow pose and lots of animal poses with noises.  I love it.  Great find. :-)",1255478400,,445,4.828947368421052
7961359,5,B000065U6I,"I bought this DVD so that I could do yoga with my high-energy, 8-year-old daughter.  She loves it!  Instead of pushing her to relax and be calm, it invites her to have fun, and so she calms herself without noticing.  The DVD has a lot of poses, more than we need for any one yoga session, and that's a plus too, because my daughter can choose her favorite poses and skip the ones she doesn't like.  She especially likes the poses that the parents and kids do together.  This yoga DVD has worked very well for us and I highly recommend it.",1227484800,,538,4.235294117647059
7961360,3,B000065U6I,I bought this to do Yoga with our three year old but there isn't much continuity. It is very broken up. It doesn't flow.,1223251200,,120,4.041666666666667
7961361,2,B000065U6I,"I ordered this video for my children, ages 3 1/2 and just-turned 2.  The poses themselves are great - explained in a way that the kids are able to do and in an enjoyable fashion.  I often see my children doing the ""dog"" pose at random times during the day.  They love that one and it is great for their balance.  In general, the poses are definitely more age-appropriate for the 3 1/2 year old than the 2 year old.

The problem with the video is lots and lots and lots of talking.  In between each pose, they discuss what it is good for, etc.  These explanations are WAY too long, and are really unnecessary for the children.  They just want to get on with it!  They often lose interest and wander off during these talking segments.  If I stick with it and do the program with them, they will sometimes rejoin me when he starts actually doing something again, but as often as not they don't.

The video would have been much better if the explanations of how breathing works, what body part benefits from a pose, etc. were grouped in a ""parent segment"" separate from the actual workout.",1221955200,2,1085,4.375
