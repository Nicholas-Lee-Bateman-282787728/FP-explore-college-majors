8524394,2,B000S3IFT2,"Basically this is a new Galaxy Angel cast, with unlikable characters, unlikable stories, and pretty much everything that was good about Galaxy Angel before this series gone.

I wonder what these people were thinking before they made Rune, the previous cast had lots of life left in them, they didn't need replacing.

Anyway on to the facts

- DVD contains 4 episodes
- Japanese audio audio, with Eng subs
- No English dub

And lastly, Bandai Visual USA who had the license to this went out of business so really, you'd be buying this with no company to support except maybe Amazon or the seller who gets the money from you.

Avoid this show if you love the previous Galaxy Angel shows.",1309392000,,685,4.581967213114754
