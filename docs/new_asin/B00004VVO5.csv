The scenery is breathtaking and if you ever  thought Iran is a desert, break through all the stereotypical banter, and  see this country and its people in a way few people have a chance to ever  see.

1357767,5,B00004VVO5,"Wonderful and thoughtful film that addresses the issues of responsibility, dedication, injustice and disability. How a parent can not accept a child born blind and how a child feelings of not being wanted and love are the focus of this movie. I know that most of Hollywood films concentrate on Action, Adventure and happy endings. This film is the opposite it addresses issues of real life and how other cultures address those issues. I know that foreign films are more closer to real life issues and what others are afraid to address. I believe in the importance of real life events in movies and it doesn't matter if the ending end in sadness. The point is to touch the heart of the audience,this film makes the viewer reflect on action and choices, cause and effect. Brilliantly done!!!",1433462400,4,789,4.766423357664234

1357770,5,B00004VVO5,"Beautiful, beautiful film.  I watched it with my 12 and 13 year old sons, and all of us were completely engrossed from the beginning, pausing frequently to discuss issues like what it would be like to be sent off to live in a boarding school, how would it feel to know that your father is ashamed that you exist, how would it feel if all you wanted to do was to read and study with other students yet your father stuck you in an apprenticeship to a carpenter without even letting you say goodbye to the people you loved? Etc. etc.  SUCH an awesome film to share with teens for so many different reasons, including the development of tolerance and a culturally diverse point of view.

The ending is tragic, yes, but also realistic -- because, unfortunately, tragedy really occurs.  It is painful to watch the character of Mohammed's father and how, ultimately, he destroys his life and his family.  As a result, I would not show this film to young children because the themes are heavy and require maturity to encounter.

The only thing I didn't like, really, was the ambiguous re-animation of Mohammed's hand as the film ended.  Are we to believe that he wasn't really dead?  Because of the way the hand glowed, I don't think so:  I think the director was trying to indicate his belief in the survival of Mohammed beyond death.  I can understand that this might have been his way of preserving the semblance of a ""happy ending"" but I think it dissipated the power of the film and its message.  The film did not have any religious messages, so the afterlife allusion feels tacked on and without purpose.  Or, maybe Majidi's goal was simply to make the ending ambiguous, since ambiguous endings is a trendy fad these days. If so, it is sad that he would diminish the impact of his film by selling out to a trend (imho).",1423267200,,1817,4.522935779816514

1357870,1,B00004VVO5,"Upon viewing the final scene several times, it appears the crew sacrificed a horse, sending it to its death, for the sake of the film.

If someone can prove me wrong, I'd be ever so grateful.  To me, a film loses all of its beauty and merit, if animals are harmed or killed during production.  I really hope that's not the case here, but for now am unconvinced.

Filming the collapse of the bridge with the horse perilously falling and flailing about was completely unnecessary.  There are ways to show tragedy without actually harming anyone.  I enjoyed so much of this film, i.e. the unconditional love shared between grandmother and grandson, the garden of eden, lush countryside and the story of inner turmoil faced by the father.  This story was beautifully filmed, but there was no reason, whatsoever, to sacrifice a beautiful, innocent animal.",1381536000,3,850,4.861111111111111

1357873,5,B00004VVO5,"I was really surprised at what parts of Iran looked like.. One imagines that area as desert with people riding camels. In this film you see mountains and valleys and tons of lush green scenery. People are riding horses, harvesting crops like alfalfa, and living in houses built exactly the way like they do it in Eastern Europe. The people look very much like Ukrainians or Slavs in the way they dress. Women wear what looks exactly like a bubuska. Iranians are NOT Arabs but Persians and you can see the influence the Persians brought to Eastern Europe. At one point there is a scene of a woman using prayer beads that are identical to Rosary beads. The people portrayed are followers of Islam and have islamic names but in this film there isn't the constant quoting of the Koran and the madrases like you see in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The characters were excellent and their lifestyle excellently portrayed. They seemed like kind hearted, hard working, and generally good people. This film gave me a totally different view of the people of Iran. Often the government is NOT representative of the people (as many would say about us here in the USA.) This movie was an eye opener.",1361491200,8,1182,4.6875
1357874,5,B00004VVO5,"Video came packaged and was sold as new.  However, it did not load onto my portable DVD player purchased for enjoyment during a flight.  However, the disc worked fine in my computer, and I do not know why it didn't work in my other player.  I experimented with other videos to eliminate the problem source as my DVD player.  My DVD player is rather new and played other videos without any problem.

  ""Color in Paradise"" is a very sad story concerning the distant father bent on finding an alternative place for his blind son, who is well liked by his sisters, beloved grandmother, friends and teachers.  The photography is beautiful for a little known country (Iran, I beleive) and the viewer gets closer to understanding and appreciating the cultural life of country people.

1357877,5,B00004VVO5,"The cinematography is amazing. This is the kind of story for which film is made, because the filmmaker can show the astounding beauty of the world around the central character and then give the viewer a sense of how the boy perceives such beauty. It was fascinating to watch and heartbreaking to witness the inevitable conclusion. Majidi masterfully brings the viewer from a state of judging the father to understanding the agony of the father while simultaneously charming the viewer with the boy's abilities to embrace his world. Mohammed has a special understanding of animals, a sense for the changes of the natural world far beyond that of his sighted companions, and--one begins to feel--a connection to the universe (the film's title translates to ""The Color of God"") far deeper than that of his father. His father is somehow condemned to his horrible fate of losing everything and exist without his son's special attributes. I wish this film would be shown to all fifth or sixth graders in the US.",1322524800,,1005,4.91764705882353

The most visually stunning and spiritually moving movie I have ever watched! How ironic that hrough the sightless eyes of a young blind boy we see the world in its simple, uncomplicated, magnificent beauty. His story will wrench your heart strings as it did mine. Keep a tissue box nearby.",1293753600,,341,4.879310344827586
1357911,5,B00004VVO5,"I have seen many great Persian movies, but this would have to be the best one! The acting and story are both really great, which surprised me because I usually don't like touchy movies with less action.

The movie is about a handicapped but gifted young boy named Mohammed. Although he cannot see, he feels and listens his way around the places he goes. His father sees Mohammed's disability as more of a frustration coming in the way of his own happiness more than anything, and basically tries to get rid of him. While his father is in pursuit of material joys and a certain woman's hand in marriage, Mohammed is interested in the beauty of nature as well as the joys of learning, inside and outside the classroom.

There was a point in the story when Mohammed makes a speech about his feelings and finding God, and that was probably one of the saddest movie moments I have ever seen in my life. I cried so much, I had to pause the DVD for a while to get myself together. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a sad, poignant movie. And it's a refreshing look at a country we mostly hear negatively about in the news these days. You don't have to be Persian or comprehend a word of Farsi to appreciate this movie. The English subtitles are adequate, and I believe there are other language subtitle options as well.

The ending is slightly ambiguous, but I've found a lot of Farsi films to be that way. It certainly doesn't take away from this captivating movie.",1289865600,,1480,4.474074074074074
1357912,5,B00004VVO5,"This is one of my favorite movies. Honestly, anything by Majid Majidi is fantastic, but this is my favorite. The main character is a blind boy who rightfully feels unloved by his father. His father has been down on his luck, and feels that the boy is a burden. The movie is really about the father and his journey to find himself and to discover what is most important to him. One thing I love about Mijidi's films is that the children are always the most intelligent and insightful, whereas the adults, especially the men are basically bumbling fools. However, their foolishness arises from a lack of education, rather than deliberate stupidity. With a little education, insight, perseverance, and love problems can be mended in the world of Majidi.",1282003200,,750,4.821705426356589

1357914,5,B00004VVO5,"Right up there with the finest of Iranian cinema, perhaps my favourite. This has everything that exalts the medium, acting divested of any sense of pretense, photography of lush mountain village surrounds to make your jaw drop, a story of compelling sadness, a haunting soundtrack( and I include the enhanced recordings of woodpeckers and canines, links that join the father and son on their twisted journey. With the relationship between the adored grandmother and small boy I was reminded of Patha Panchali(if that's the spelling), that stunning Satijat Ray film of the 50s. The direction of the superb cinematography evokes the spirit of the great Tarkovsky! I have no higher praise for this tragic tale. The river death, the struggling horse, the desperate dad, still leaves me gasping(though I've watched the film several times). It makes the downriver trek of,'Deliverance' seem like a paddle in a pond. And the Pieta scene at the film's end with the glowing, resurrecting hand is appropriately transcendent.",1265673600,4,1014,5.226993865030675
1357915,5,B00004VVO5,"I have trouble explaining this magnificent movie to people. How can the few moments of bliss/paradise be so moving and wrenching? How is it possible that only a few minutes into the film you care about the little boy at its center as much as you do? How is the pain and the terror of the story's unfolding as dramatic as it is when there is also a seeming inevitability about it?  I guess it is called ""art."" And artful this film surely is. The use of slow-motion. The acting...all the acting, which is not like Hollywood acting at all and in fact never feels like any kind of acting at all is superb. A culture produced this film. An Iranian culture. I know there is great repression in that country, but there is clearly something else afoot as well.  This film could be about ""evil,"" painted with a simple brush.  But it is not.  The character who brings pain is nuanced.  More clumsy and ineffectual and weak than evil. I know there is a great deal of simplistic religious fervor in Iran, as there is in our country, but this is a deeply religious film with no fundamentalist judgment or edge. Just some sense of grace that seems heartfelt, genuine and loving.",1264809600,8,1164,4.446009389671362
1357916,5,B00004VVO5,"When I was invited to see this film, I was absolutely certain I wouldn't like it.  Within minutes I was completely hooked.  I can't say enough good about this film and would recommend it to anyone.  Aside from its moving story, it has the advantage of bringing to western audiences a perception of real people in Iran, far removed from the political scenes that wallpaper our imagination when we think of this problematic country in our daily news -- real people, real children, real families, and not a single moment of propaganda.

1357930,5,B00004VVO5,"From the producer of the ACADEMY AWARD nominee, CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, Majid Majidi, comes this sequel, THE COLOR OF PARADISE. Described as 'Stunningly beautiful. A gem."" by Stephen Holden of the New York Times. Winner of the BEST PICTURE at the 1999 Montreal Film Festival and other awards internationally, this is a story about an 8 year old blind boy and his relationship with his widowed father. It grabs your heart immediately as the boarding school for blind children in Tehran, where Mohammad attends, is ending for summer vacation. Mohammad is the only child left after all the other parents have picked up their children. He is sitting alone on a bench and hears a baby bird fall out of its nest and chirping on the ground. He also hears a cat nearby. He manages to shoo the cat away and find the baby bird and climb the tree and return it to its nest. Welcome to the world of the blind. His father finally arrives and wants to leave him there. We meet a poor, hard working man from a rural village who has lost his wife and is trying to raise his other two daughters and make a living as best he can. He also wants to remarry and considers Mohammad to be an obstacle to finding a wife. The rest is a wonderful human interest story. The scenery is outstanding. Iran is really a beautiful country in many areas. Many emotions come to the surface during the film. It is a film you can easily watch with children who are mature enough to understand the themes. It is worth watching just to better understand the handicap of being a blind child. If you've seen CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, you know what's in store. Rated PG for mature themes, there is no offensive language or material of any kind. YOU WILL BE DOING YOURSELF A FAVOR BY PUTTING THIS AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST.",1237680000,,1768,4.42638036809816

 This movie touched my heart deeply.  It is a story of a young blind boy, Mohammad, who is so sensitive that he experiences more of life than most sighted people ever do.  His  widowed father loves him yet views Mohammad as a burden and as a hinderance to his marriage prospects.  A loving  grandmother is Mohammad's teacher and advocate, she intuitively understands and protects her grandson but is undermined by her self-centered son.  Her grief is so real it will bring you to tears.

 This movie crosses all cultural and religious boundaries in a celebration of the human spirit.  There could not be a better time to see this movie than right now.",1164758400,14,804,4.468965517241379
1357989,5,B00004VVO5,"This is another fine film by Iranian director Magid Magidi. In its manner, it seems to reflect issues in Iran's culture (its faith-based adherence to patriarchy, for one), while treating them in what seems to be a gently elusive way, at least on the surface, while appealing at the same time to more universal and deeply felt values that cross national boundaries everywhere. The elusiveness may well result from the heavy-handed control of artistic expression in the Islamic Republic (see Shirin Ebadi, ""Iran Awakening"") but patience rewards the viewer with what is a thoughtful meditation on the struggle for dignity, personal safety, and a harmonious community life.

In this film, Magidi portrays the plight of a blind boy whose misfortune it is to have a widowed father more selfishly concerned with winning a new wife than providing a loving home for his disabled son. The film is set in the lush, beautiful mountains north of Tehran and bordering the Caspian Sea. It celebrates village life and takes time to show us time-honored occupations - carpentry, making charcoal, and dying lambs wool - as well as the traditions of courtship, where marriages are arranged by the bride's family. The self-pitying father, with the power he wields in a patriarchal culture, eventually learns too late that all of his actions have created a tragedy that for the viewer is shocking and heartbreaking.

The performances, especially by the blind boy who plays the son, are riveting. The photogrpahy cries out for a big screen, and the sound is richly enhanced to emphasize the boy's heightend sensitivity to birdsong. The closing sequence involving a flooded stream is unforgettable.",1156550400,12,1675,5.109489051094891
1357990,4,B00004VVO5,"As a genera, foreign films are much more beautiful than anything produced by Hollywood. The Color of Paradise was no exception. Right from the start the audience was immersed in a heart wrenching family drama transcending both time and culture. The beauty of this film is, whether you grew up in Iran or any place else on the planet, you can't help but empathize with the plight of Mohammad and Hashem. Although filmed in a foreign land the plot is definitely not a foreign concept. The characters speak Farsi but once you turn on the subtitles even the language barrier goes away.

 The plot in and of itself would be enough to command the title of best film produced in years. What makes this film even more spectacular is the scenery. With a lot of outdoor action, the audience is exposed to beautiful countryside filled with mountaintops, surrounded by fields of flowers of all different shapes and colors. It is interesting to note how the characters utilize their surroundings by romping around in the field or taking care of the farm chores. This really allows the viewer a sense of what an Iranian peasant village looks like. As someone living in a country where there are no villages, it was interesting to note how the community comes together and buckles down to get all of the chores done. They aren't afraid of hard work even though they don't have many of the technological advances of a big city to make life easier. I found it very commendable that even the children helped without complaint.  When you find yourself wishing you were part of their family, you know that the director has done his or her job.

 This film really reminded me of how sensitive children can be. Often times adults don't realize how quickly children catch on to what you are feeling. Nor do they realize how it affects them. Adults don't always realize that when you take on the responsibility of a child, you have to give up your wants and needs in place of the child's needs. I really felt bad for Mohammad that his father was so incredibly wrapped up in his own grief and selfishness that he couldn't or wouldn't understand that concept. At times I just wanted to shout at Hashem ""Wake up you bone head. Can't you see your son needs you? Get over your selfishness for once in your life and love your son.""  There were times I had to keep from crying or yelling I was so mad at the father and sad for the child. I just wanted to take Mohammad in my arms and tell him everything would be ok. The characters were so real to me it was as if I was talking to someone in my own community.

 I have been a babysitter for many of the children in my neighborhood and have gotten to know them and love them as if they were my own. Watching The Color of Paradise I got that same sense of attachment to Mohammad as if he were my own charge. When a director is able to make you feel that strongly for a character you really attach yourself to the film. Often times in Hollywood their films are so focused on parlor tricks to keep the audience entertained. They want a fast-paced plot line and don't care if they end up with flat one-dimensional characters. Often what works for foreign films is that the viewer is able to attach himself to the character. What they sacrifice in plot line they make up for in scenery and three-dimensional characters whose wants fears and interactions between others are amazingly deep. It's as if you could see yourself fitting in knowing their every move and motivation.

 My eyes were opened to how a blind person gets along in life. I'm not blind and I've never known anyone who was blind. I had no idea that a blind person was capable of having almost the same interactions with the world as a normal person. It amazes me how much a blind person comes to rely on his other four senses. I rely so heavily on my sight that often I take for granted how something feels, smells, or sounds. Mohammad spent a lot of time outdoors. His only real link to nature is through his smell and touch. I can just look at a flower and tell what kind it is. A blind person really learns to identify the different smells associated with each flower. Although a blind has a different perspective on the world that doesn't mean they are any more crippled than I am. With the invention of brail and other tools for the blind, they can have the same goals and aspirations and accomplish the same tasks as any one.

 The Color of Paradise really opened my eyes to some many amazing things. I am glad I watched it and will recommend it to everyone.",1155427200,6,4543,4.440576230492197
1357991,5,B00004VVO5,"After I watched this movie, for a while, I became more enthusiasic for life and this world thanks to Mohammed. I watch parts of this movie over and over again, the part in which he discovers the crops growing in the fields in his village, the part in which he is discovering sand , water and the call of sea birds by a beach and the time, he is happy to come into his village and shouts out to his grandmother over and over again.

This is going to be one of my all time favorite movies. Its a beautiful story, of a beautiful blind boy and his adoring sisters and grandmother. I have bought this dvd for my personal collection and shall be watching it when I need some cheering up.

1357993,5,B00004VVO5,"This is a story of two worlds, one through the eyes of a blind young boy and the other of his widowed father.  The blind boy's existence is the beauty and nature that he connects with, and of course, a Granny and two sisters who love him.  The other side is the self-pity, misery and selfishness that lives within his father.

Mohammad attends a school for the blind and for the 3-month break, his father almost doesn't come to pick him up, and arriving late, he asks the school to keep his son.  They cannot do it.

The boy comes home to his endearing grandmother and two sisters, only to have his father plot to give the boy away because father feels so burdened as a widow, and can't bear the thought of more misery by caring for a blind boy the rest of his life.

It's Granny who recognizes the selfishness of the father and isn't concerned how the blind boy will make it through life, she worries about his father.  He breaks down easily, is lonely, and miserable man who wants to marry a woman.  Surely, the boy is in his way now.

This is an outstanding cast, from the father, Granny, and surely the performance of the boy is actually blind.  The scenery is beautiful.

1357994,5,B00004VVO5,"I can't review this movie any better than has already been done, but let me just tell you this: don't do what I did. I watched it in the 3rd trimester of my first pregnancy. I was balling uncontrollably for hours after.

 Not only does it wrench your heart that the poor little boy is blind, but the beautiful, unconditional love that his sisters and grandmother have for him, the simple joys he finds in things that people with sight take for granted...it all sets you up for agony when he has to wait for his reluctant father to take him home from a school that keeps him away from all of these things he loves. (wow, that's a run on sentence).

 The father sees him as an obstacle to prevent his second marriage, but is obviously riddled with guilt trying to get rid of him. I found these scenes especially poignant. With an adopted brother of my own, it made me think of all the poor, unwanted children in the world, many of whom are given up because of physical or mental deficiencies.

 Then, with my own impending child, I thought of how I would react to a child with problems. Would I want to be rid of them so my life could be ""normal""? It's easy to see how eliminating such complications could be so tempting (ie. abortion, dumping your kid at the carpenter's house). When you watch Mohammed, and his beautiful mind and spirit overcome you, you hate yourself for  ever giving rise to the possibility that you wouldn't want any child you were blessed with. I hate myself now just for admitting this.

 So just when you think things can't get any worse, they of course do. And then you beat yourself up all over again. And of course, if you're pregnant, or have kids, or want kids, or are in any way a compassionate individual, you will wallow in despair.  And despite this despair, you will love the movie for showing you what a shallow, self-centered person you are and how you should savor the beauty of the simple things that do, in fact, make our lives paradise.

1357998,5,B00004VVO5,"Majid Majidi's The Color of Paradise is a heart-felt film that explores love and the withholding of love. The story centers around a father's (Hashem) anger with God for giving him a son (Mohammad) who is blind, and hence flawed and perceived as a burden. Hashem does everything he can to ""lose"" his son, from pleading with the school to take him regardless of the summer break, to pawning him off as an apprentice to a blind carpenter.

Although Mohammad is not ""whole"" in Hashem's eyes, as is the mirror he drops and cracks while shaving in a scene, he is still his son and capable of providing him unconditional love and is therefore of some ""use,"" as is the mirror now cracked--it's imperfect, but still capable of serving a purpose. But as with the mirror, Hashem rejects Mohammad, which ultimatley leads to even greater loss.

The message is simple: Appreciate what God gives you, if necessary adjusting your values to accommodate that gift. For it is never His gift that is flawed, but rather our perception of such.",1120003200,16,1023,4.709497206703911

1358000,5,B00004VVO5,"This movie is searingly true to its title. The beauty of the Iranian countryside, the lush colors and the heightened sound effects are indescribable. The irony of all that beauty? The main character is a blind boy. You feel the true depth of Mohammad's tragedy as he lives surrounded by paradise but unable to see it. Still, he is more connected to nature and the wonder of his remaining senses than the adults who surround him.

Or, more to the point, than his father. With every furtive look at the boy, the father, Hashem (played chillingly by Hossein Mahjub), gives the gut-wrenching impression of a parent who wants to dispose of his own child. My belly was in continual knots of fear as I watched Hashem shunt this burden out of his life and then back in again, only to invite the ultimate disaster.

My stomach didn't unknot for at least 30 minutes after the climax of the film. The climax was more frightening, to me, than the horror flicks people watch to scare themselves. It was so frightening because by that stage Mohammad had well and truly burrowed into my affections.

The redemption scene at the end of the movie is the one thing that spoils this film. I gave THE COLOR OF PARADISE six stars for superior filmmaking but took back one star for the unsatisfying and melodramatic ending.

Mohammad is played by Mohsen Ramezani with extraordinary depth. His sisters give sincere meaning to the word adorable, and the granny is precious. This movie will stick in my mind's eye for a long time to come.",1105401600,12,1513,4.634328358208955

1358003,4,B00004VVO5,"Iranian filmmakers are always going to have a hard time competing with Hollywood in the West.  But with ""A Color of Paradise"", director Majid Majidi (acclaimed and best known for ""The Children of Heaven"", a story of a brother and sister who share the same pair of shoes) has produced a film that in content, themes and beauty makes a great deal of modern blockbusters look nasty and expensive.  In Arabic (with English subtitles), it's the story of eight-year old Mohammad, a blind boy who attends a school for the blind in Tehran.  When the school breaks for the summer months, Mohammad's father is the last to pick him up, even then only after trying to have the school keep the boy.  His reasons become obvious after he retreats to his home in the Iranian countryside: taking care of his son is a burden in his quest to win the dowry and the hand of a local woman in marriage, and his son is a threat to his own future well-being.  As Mohammad enjoys life in the picturesque countryside with his two sisters and grandmother, he is oblivious to his father's plans to get rid of him.
The movie develops a sharp contrast between the boy and his father: despite the fact that he can see, his father is caught up in blind selfishness where he cares only about himself; Despite his blindness, Mohammad ""sees"" the beauty of life, and is full of wonder at the sounds of birds and the magnificence of creation.  As the blind boy reads the Braille alphabet in nature and reaches out to its helpless creatures, it becomes evident that the abandoned baby bird he rescues, as well as the trapped fish and overturned turtle we see are really metaphors of Mohammad's own helplessness before his father.  The boy's grandmother is a quiet figure, but she sees both her blind grandson's worth and her son's moral corruption.  But can anything save Mohammad's father from his own selfishness?  He's already lost his first wife, but now his selfishness threatens to make him lose his mother, his son, and even his future wife.  The story switches gears towards the conclusion with some tense drama and action scenes revolving around a broken bridge and a raging river.  The stunning ending features a moving closing scene that leaves open lots of questions and is sure to create lots of discussion among viewers.
""Color of Paradise"" may lack the big budgets and spectacular effects available to Hollywood - and at times it shows - but on the whole this story has a gentle and poignant beauty that touches the heart.  There are many in Western society who have the eyes of Mohammad's father, yet share his inner blindness.  For such ""seeing"" people and for us all, this is a ""must-see"" movie that may change the way you look at others and at the world.  - GODLY GADFLY",1085702400,8,2750,4.620123203285421

1358006,5,B00004VVO5,"Tired of exploding cars, gratuitous violence, and mindless sex in your movie viewing?  Then you're in for a real treat.  ""The Color of Paradise"" draws deeply from the soul of Persia, and presents to us a story that is at once profoundly simple and profoundly moving.  God, Nature, Humanity intersect in a village high in the mountains of Iran, and these are shown to us by a blind eight year old boy. This  child, Mohammed, revels in all that is life in this poor, isolated, rugged community.
While the story takes place in a Moslem setting, I cannot help but see reflections of the teachings of other great religions, Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism.  As I watched this little innocent, I thought of the phrase from the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, ""out of the mouths of babes and sucklings shall come words of wisdom.""  From Jesus, ""Let the little children come unto me, for of such are the Kingdom of Heaven.""  And the Buddha, who taught us to stop and look at the wonder of nature all around us.
Mohammed's father sees none of this.  Sadly, he is the one who is truly blind.  Others look at Mohammed and see a beautiful, intelligent, gifted child, where his father sees only a child who is cursed, and that he himself is cursed thereby.  The father's blindness teaches us the perils of what happens when we ignore that which is good,lovely, beautiful.  This man is nearly paralyzed by fear, doubt, and self-loathing.  His son would love to put out his hand and lead his father out of his misery, but the father is so short-sighted, so blinded that he cannot see the salvation that is within his own home.

The fact that this film comes from Iran, should be an example of how universal the art of cinema is.
Majidi is certainly one of the best directors from any nationality. After making a masterpiece in Children Of Heaven which will be released on DVD in September, he scores yet again for the enjoyment of us all with Color of Paradise, a story of Mohamed, a blind boy, and his relationship with his father, the excellent Hussain Mahjoub, with his sisters, his grandmother,and with nature.
It is a tragic story filmed without falling in the trap of sentimentality.
It is a universal story, and the little Mohamed can be any blind boy in any country in the world..this is why Majidi's films while Iranian in their setting, they touch every viewer from any culture. He also has the sensitivities to his surroundings and subject matter of great directors, such as Truffaut and De Sica.
Majidi and most Iranian directors have used amateur children in the lead role to excellent effect, and the world we see through the eyes of these children, is filmed with such care and understanding.
Iranian cinema has gained international recognition, especially in Europe, taking several awards in Cannes and Venice, and it is such a great achievement for the art of cinema itself, proving yet again that it is one form that can bring cultures together in a sophisticated platform.
The scenery in Color of Paradise is breathtaking, and will surprise many as i was, by how beautiful a country Iran is.

1358128,5,B00004VVO5,"I was really prompted to see The Color of Paradise after being interviewed for a senior thesis by a student who is of Thai & African-American parentage born in Iran.  Several months ago I had seen the preview to the Color of Paradise on another video with lush scenery & a tragedic, but triumphant ending the movie, I Dreamed of Africa. I count myself very fortunate to have found it in my town.
The Color of Paradise met all the requirements of a movie which is a work of art.  It showed the beauty of a country that few Americans are even interested in knowing about or visiting even though the Iranian government is encouraging tourism.  This movie is about the ones who really matter, the common people, living like so many world-wide going about daily seeking beauty in life & eventually dying. A culture is presented here in brush strokes of simplicity and profoundity.  It shows how people all over the world are so alike especially in non-western cultures.  My mom watched this film with me and even though she didn't keep up with the subtitles she loved this movie because it had such a nostalgic feel to it & she loved the sheer beauty of the Iranian landscape.  Oddly enough Muhammad & his family's world was very much like the world she grew up in years ago in the southern US in the African-American community.  The fields, chickens in the yard, children doing chores, playing, smiling, going to school, the love of nature, faith in a supreme being, the means of courtship, the importance of family and the community were very much the same during my mom's childhood as they are presented in the film.
The Color of Paradise was nostalgic for me too.  It really brought back memories of my stay in  southern Africa.  The pace of the culture and the values are very much the same where I lived as in the film.  Little things were so similar like when Muhammad's sister was sweeping the ground outside the entrance of the house that she & her dad had finished white washing.  I often saw women sweeping the yard outside your homes during the day when I was living in Africa with the same sort of brooms.  In my mom's day her mom did the same chore everyday with what they called a brushroom.  Seeing so many children on film with smiling faces also brought back thoughts of Africa.  It pains me that so few American children these days know how to smile or desire to play outside like Muhammad and his sisters.
I really hoped that the film wouldn't have a tragic ending, but so many foreign films and novels do, but that is true to life unlike the happy endings that Hollywood tends to tack on to films.  The Color of Paradise is not only a work of art, but a morality tale. It shows how so often people only realize how much others mean to them when it's too late.  Muhammad's father was spoiled & unappreciative of his mother until it was too late.  He never took the time to see the worth and genius of his son.  Ironically, Muhammad was more appreciated at his sister's school where he was only a guest for a day than by his dad.  As the old people used to say, ""You don't miss your water until your well runs dry.""  On the beach, with Muhammad's body in his arms, his father certainly did.
The American public needs exposure to such films as the Color of Paradise.  Right now America is into sex, violence, shallowness and ugliness in nearly every aspect of our culture.  Perhaps if more public theaters stopped worrying so much about money and became courageous enough to show such meaningful films more Americans would see that there are cultures that still value the things that we once did when there was still balance, sensibility, & sanity in our society.
I think the film was aptly named.  It is believed that the Garden of Eden was in modern day Iran or Iraq.  The scenery in The Color of Paradise makes me believe this is so.
I was mesmerized by this film, and I wept outwardly and inwardly not only at the end but during several of the scenes of the Iranian countryside.  The Color of Paradise said so much with few words.",1006992000,27,4047,4.4646739130434785
1358129,5,B00004VVO5,"As someone else pointed out, the correct translation should have been 'The Color of God'.  I believe Mohammed saw colors to which the rest of us are truly blind.
No leading men, no mud-adorned nymphs wallowing in the wild, no swelling sound track, no special effects, no pathetic plot that becomes painfully obvious after the first five minutes...
The director of this movie knows how to tell a story.  And tell it very well.
This movie made me cry several times, which is something I almost never do.  It made me love and respect a little boy so full of life that he gave a little of himself to everything he touched.  I didn't hate the father, I grew to have compassion for him because he was weak and full of fear.  The fear speaking in his eyes as he watched the current take his little son away, the fear saying 'please die for me, it will be so much easier if you die now...'.
The grandmother spoke volumes with her eyes.  When she stood watching her grandson tyring to hide from her behind a tree, you could so clearly share her love.  When Mohammed touched her, feeling her face, then her hands, there was a communication that needed no words.  When Mohammed started crying because he wanted to go to school with his sisters, she said 'Please don't cry.  I would die for you.'  I believed her.

1358130,5,B00004VVO5,"The movie tells that a blind child Mohammed came to his village with his reluctant father from the school in Tehran. There he lived with his grandmother, his father and his two sisters. His father wanted to remarry and was worried by the fact that he had a blind son. He wanted to send Mohammed to a blind carpenter as a apprentice. But the kind grandmother rejected that. When one day his father took Mohammed away to the carpenter, his grandmother grieved and passed away soon. The fiancee's family rejected the marriage because they saw the death as an ominous sign for the marriage. When the father brought Mohammed back in a rainy day, Mohammed slipped into the flooding brook and flowed away. His father jumped into the brook and pursuit him. Eventually he found Mohammed's body and held it in deep sorrow.
The movie is so beautifully shot. The cinematography is superb. A few scenes are breathtakingly stunning:
1. When the grandmother knew that his son had taken his grandson away, she stood desolately in sadness. The snowwhite chicken feathers were whirling lightly aournd her and the movie turned into silence. Without a single word, the love of the grandmother to her grandson was brilliantly presented.
2. When the grandmother passed away, the old lady was like a goddess as the camera closed to her serene face. The screen lightened up and very tender music raised after a while of complete silence. I could hardly believe she had passed away although I knew she actually had. Purely poetical!
3. At the end of the movie, when Mohammed was flooded away, I was extremely sad and felt helpless. His father eventually found his body. He held the body and wept deeply. the camera lingered at the hand of the boy. The fingers moved, the screen was brightened up. At that moment I was totally mesmerized and felt no more sadness. The movie beautifully ended there, as I was left utterly speechless.
One of the disgusting things about a lot of these days' movies is pretension and affectation--corny love must be accompanied by grandiose soundtrack and our feelings towards the movies are therefore misled and become untrue. In contrast, a lot of Iranian movies have very little musical score, touching the souls purely by acting and photography. The color of paradise, instead using bunch of music, use elements of true lives, such as the sound of woodpeckers, which makes the movie uncommonly refreshing.

When he cries out, asking how God could have made him blind so he could not see Him, he spoke for all of us I think. And even though his father seemed cruel at first, I could not hate him: I also know what it feels like to love someone and at the same time not know how you are going to take care of them, and to not be able to believe that you will be taken care of.

1358133,4,B00004VVO5,"For a child whom perhaps Life forgot, this film had me frozen to the seat, not moving, listening intently, trying not to breathe. The theme of a blind child groping for his place(so to speak)whilst having the weight of thistledown for his father, brings the story to a conflict of selfishness and struggle. For me, the sound made the film.  The sounds were acute and precise, a fascinating parallel between Muhummad's vision impairment and his connection with his surroundings.  Using the woodpecker as a morse code-esque symbol was a beautiful touch.  Perhaps, the only unnerving part of the film was it's dramatic and in my view uncalled for finale involving the horse.  The subtitles in their Middle Eastern text would also make it very difficult for Western animal welfare organisations to complain!  A masterpiece of sound from Iran.",993427200,,838,5.043478260869565

1358187,5,B00004VVO5,"You may find it difficult to rent a quiet, deceptively simple film about a few months in the life of a blind boy-but overcome your resistance and treat yourself to one of the finest films of the year..  A gem.  And one of the most beautiful looking films you'll ever see.  The cinematography is simply spectacular. The story deeply moving and unforgettable.  And yes you'll most likely have to read subtitles (though not that many) unless you speak Farsi.
Although I'm aware the film teeters dangerously close to Spielberg-ian heartstring pulling manipulation, it's also powerful, uncompromising and a film that gets all of its details exactly right.
We meet Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani) at the school for the blind in Tehran where he resides. We see the students leading each other around, learning how to read and write in Braille, and packing up to meet their parents as the school prepares to close for three months.  Mohammad's father is very late. All the other children have been picked up by their parents.  The teacher remains positive that the father will arrive to pick Mohammed up.  We aren't so sure.
Mohammad gets up off the bench, and wanders off the path, over to a tree.  He kneels down and at first it appears he is going to dig a hole in the dirt.  But he continues to move the leaves around with his hands. We aren't sure what he is doing.  Then he finds the tiny bird that has fallen from it's nest.  We watch in amazement as he carefully picks the tiny bird up, and then proceeds to climb the tree and put the bird back into its nest.  Mohammed we realize is a very special, gifted and sensitive 8 year old boy who just happens to be blind.
Director Majid Majidi finds a wonderful way to let us quickly stop pitying the blind child and come to admire and perhaps understand the character.  Several times throughout the film we hear noises, before we see what the source of the noise is.  We get close-ups of Mohammed's hand as he feels a creek bed for some stones, or plays with some wheat and begins quietly muttering some letters from the alphabet.  He reads with his fingers and memorizes his lessons anyway he can.  He has never stopped trying to learn, trying to less of a burden and embarrassment to his father.
Mohammad's father (Hossein Mahjub) reluctantly picks up his son at the school.  We learn his wife has died and they will travel to the north where Mohammed's  two young sisters and Grandmother live.  Mohammed is loved and accepted as a whole person by everyone but his father.  His father hopes to get married and sees his son as a weight that drags him down.  He feels life had treated him unfairly by giving him a blind son to take care of and by taking his wife away from him.  He is trying to win the hand of a women in the village and has been working very hard to raise the dowry and present the gifts necessary to get her hand in marriage.  When asked he talks about his two daughters but does not mention his blind son.  Perhaps his blind son would be seen a negative omen by his future father-in-law and so he must deny his very existence.
Mohammed is full of life and has a strong connection, even a spiritual connection to everything that surrounds him.  He has been told that he is a special person because God particularly loves the blind and since God is invisible and can only be felt, it will be the blind who will feel him first.  Mohammed the young boy wants desperately to believe that but as he comes to realize that his father views him as a burden, he begins to doubt the truth of what he has been told.
The camera lovingly braces the lush country side of the North Country of Iran.  We see the beauty that Mohammed can only see and feel.  We get a sense of what it must be like for him to put his overly sensitive fingers into the creek, to feel the Caspian Sea on his feet, to have a butterfly tickle his skin, to hear the birds and animals around him.  To know his younger sister has gotten older by touching her face and declaring. .  ""My you have grown!""  And while the camera takes the time to linger on certain shots it does not linger too long.  The film almost always remains positive, almost always shows us the good of things.
Almost.
While his father is almost deathly afraid of certain sounds, Mohammed remains curious and calm with everything that is around him.  He is full of life, wonder and love in contrast to being full of fear, anger and bitterness.
Majidi has created a ninety minute work which is rich with visual and emotional textures that will stay with you long after the film is over.  Much of the film, because of its subject matter has a sadness to it.  But like Mohammed the film sees beauty and richness everywhere and reminds us  there is much we take for granted-like the beauty and compassion  a young blind boy easily `sees' and accepts.
NOTE: The film's Farsi title actually translates to The Color of God but the film has been re-titled in English: The Color of Paradise.

Instead I saw the most spectacular, moving movie I have seen in a long time. A movie so good it left me paralyzed.  I sat staring at the screen in awe until all the credits had surpassed ,and as I turned to my mother, in awe, gently snapping out of it, I saw that she too still had her eyes glued to the screen.  And then as I looked around still, I saw that everybody else in the theatre was in awe as well.  The best movie of the year without a doubt. Hollywood has a lot to learn. America is being left behind in the art of storytelling on screen and Iran was not a country I thought had too surpassed us. But it has, with this director and it's gentle simple riveting style.

I'm a European, but still thought that Iran was all desert, but the wonderful photography of this film revealed its forest, mountains, and colorful poppyfields. Then, the acting! So moving and so well-done, especially by the boy who plays the lead role and the actress who plays his grandmother.  The story is a little fantastic in places, but plausible, and any sentimentality forgiven for its tenderness and beauty.

1358191,5,B00004VVO5,"I saw the movie ""The Color of Paradise"" on video the other night. Set in Iran and shown in Persian with English subtitles, it 's a film superbly written and directed by Majid Majidi, also known for his remarkable film ""Children of Heaven"".  With excellent cinematography and great music,  ""The Color of Paradise"" offers us a look at another side of Iran we don't usually see or have never seen before. Throughout the film, scenes of the country's rich vegetation, lush landscapes and majestic mountains almost give us a glimpse of paradise. A beautiful story supported by fine performances of the whole cast, particularly of the blind young actor in the main role, it's a refreshing second look at a country less familiar and its people. The film not only shows some of the country's customs and beliefs but also reveals what is universal to us all. Simple acts of heroism, as when the blind boy struggles to climb a tree to rescue a fallen little bird... a woman's unselfish love and sacrifice for her son and grandson... the young girls' pure joy of seeing the smile in their grandmother's eyes as their brother returns home... a blind boy's tragic sense of being abandoned...a father's sense of failure and of redemption. The film is filled with travels into the human heart, and what we discover is that which reaffirms our similarities, one common tie that binds us all. What I love most about the film is that it shows how the blind boy's heightened senses, his touch, his hearing, and his heart, took the place of his eyes as his window to the beauty and promise of life around him. In spite of his handicap, he exemplified courage, enthusiasm, and the awareness to experience life. The film brings to mind the message that Jesus told his doubting disciple Thomas: blessed are those that have not seen but yet believed. Although Jesus was talking about faith, I think we could extend the message he gave to how we view life, how we perceive its beauty, its promise in spite of adversity, in spite of broken dreams. The boy is blind but he sees life, and embraces it with fervor.

The young boy who plays the role of the blind child, Mohammed, was extraordinary. His scene near the pond with the blind carpenter was one of the best I have ever watched. The director also did some wonderful things with the boy's hands: when he read and ""wrote"" his Braile materials, when he learned about something by feeling it, when he searched for the tiny bird in the leaves.
This movie showed the power of family love and the devastation when a child feels unloved. It also allowed the viewer to get a glimpse at the way of life in the countryside of Iran.
