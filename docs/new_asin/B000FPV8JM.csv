8125434,5,B000FPV8JM,Years ago I watched First Born over broadcast television.  It was shown in three parts.  A neighbor and I watched each episode and looked forward for each episode.  The premise of a hybrid human/gorilla was clever and the ending memorable.  Please release in NTSC format for the US trade.,1309564800,9,288,4.816326530612245
8125435,5,B000FPV8JM,"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen on the subject. Charles Dance is a joy to watch as an actor. The show is ahead of its time. It nails the problem with hybrid species in an elegant way. I have been trying to get
this show in a region one format for US tv. Please consider releasing it for this country. You would have many
takers.",1290729600,11,343,3.914285714285714
8125436,5,B000FPV8JM,"This movie has a fascinating premise.  About twenty years ago this film was played late-night in the U.S. in three installments and I have never forgotten it.  The story revolves around what happens when a human embryo is carried to term by an ape.  Charles Dance gives yet another outstanding performance and the cast and special effects are uniformly good.  Imagine how frustrated I was to finally find the film on DVD, but only on PAL.  Please release this in the U.S. as a region 1 NTSC DVD.  The film deserves a wider audience.",1289692800,15,532,4.6063829787234045
