monster in a box is Spalding Gray at his best:  acerbic but insightful.  he is intelligent and speaks to his audience as if they were also.  i will watch this again and again.
mrs parker and the vicious circle is a treasure.  i've been of fan of Dorothy Parker for years.  Jennifer Jason Leigh sounded exactly as i'd imagined Dorothy would have.  the assembled cast was amazing.  the algonquin round table has been the subject of books and documentaries as have the individual artists.  if this grabs your attention you will want to pursue the characters further.",1377043200,,698,4.733333333333333
8204397,5,B000S6LS4I,"Jeremy Irons WATERLAND is not much of a movie, the fact that Irons was able to not only save the film but make it work is amazing. A true testement to his talent. The Spalding Grey piece gives us a glimpse into his comedic side. Worth watching. The Mrs. Parker movie is the true gem here, cannot recommend a better film about the now famous group of writer's.",1252886400,5,359,4.294117647058823
