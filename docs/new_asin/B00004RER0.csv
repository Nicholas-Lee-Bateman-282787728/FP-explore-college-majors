1343852,5,B00004RER0,"Rites of Passage starts off like a suspense thriller.  Two men are in the woods camping when along comes a man asking for help.  It doesn't take long  for them to figure out that the man is an escaped convict.  But by then  it's to late, a second convict shows up and murders the two  campers.
After this, the movie quickly moves to its real substance:  family drama.  It's a story about a father and two brothers that somehow  remind us of Cain and Abel.  Not because one brother was good and the other  evil, but because the father viewed them that way.  Campbell, the youngest  of the two brothers, is the father's disappointment.  DJ, of course, is the  father's pride and joy.
By coincidence, they all end up together in the  family's cabin in the woods.  Needless to say, the family quarrels begin as  the father's adultery surfaces.  Of course, the father isn't the only one  who has skeletons in the closet.  In the meantime, guess who shows up?  None other than the escaped convicts.
At this point, the scriptwriter  continues the family drama while introducing elements of suspense and  mystery.  For the first time in years, I sat glued to the screen wondering  what was going to happen next.  Hats off to the scriptwriter, who cleverly  introduces new twists and turns without losing focus of his central theme:  the consequences of father/son relationships.
Great acting crowns this  superb script, making Rites of Passage one of the most intense, original  and rewarding movies I've seen.",966816000,15,1502,4.75

The script, however, has holes that you can drive a truck through, and the plot is silly bordering on the inane. There is no new territory  here at all and the territory that is opened has been been covered better  by other gay and non-gay themed films. I felt like I was being fed a  Twinkie and told that it was roasted duck (an old Hollywood trick that is  now increasingly present in ""independent"" films).",963014400,3,486,4.426966292134831
1343855,4,B00004RER0,"RITES OF PASSAGE

(USA - 1998 - color & black and white)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SR

If DVD is about anything at all, it's about rescuing worthwhile movies from undeserved obscurity. And Victor Salva's RITES OF PASSAGE (1998) is a GREAT movie, a textbook example of economy and precision, brimming with honest emotion and high quality drama. On the one hand, it's a wrenchingly powerful examination of a young gay man (Jason Behr, from TV's ""Roswell"") coming to terms with years of neglect at the hands of an abusive father (Dean Stockwell) who doesn't know how to communicate with him. And on the other, it's a hairy-chested thriller about a father and his grown-up sons (Behr and Robert Keith) who must set aside their differences when their visit to an isolated mountain cabin coincides with the arrival of two escaped convicts (James Remar and Jaimz Wolvett)  who are searching for buried loot. These disparate strands are woven seamlessly into a satisfying whole, allowing gut-wrenching thrills to develop naturally from the emotional stand-offs which underline most of the featured relationships.

A heavyweight cast rises to the challenge of Salva's extraordinarily complex script, and the film's technical  construction simply cannot be faulted. It's a testament to all involved that the plot never becomes static or claustrophobic, despite the single isolated setting (the bulk of the film takes place in and around a mountain cabin during one particular night), and while the heroes and villains are clearly signposted, Salva's corkscrew plot encourages us to repeatedly question our understanding of the characters and their motivations. For all its action and suspense, this thriller has a tender heart and a vivid  appreciation of human virtues and frailties.

Salva and Behr recorded an articulate, humorous, and hugely engaging commentary track for the original US DVD which explained  the origins of the script (rooted in Salva's own childhood with a difficult stepfather), the casting process, and a wealth of production details. Salva lavishes praise on all his collaborators, particularly on Behr whose superb performance is the crux of the entire film, to a point where Salva eventually becomes a little embarrassed by his own effusive compliments. To his credit, Salva's appraisals seems like genuine reactions to the consummate skill of his cast and crew, and it's left to Behr to point out the writer-director's own significant contribution to the movie's artistic  success.

Bottom line:  Rent it, buy it, or borrow it, even if it's just to drool over Jason Behr (!), but whatever you do, DON'T MISS IT. POWDER proved that  Salva could work magic with a substantial budget, while RITES OF PASSAGE demonstrates his unique ability to create similar miracles  with virtually no money at all. An absolute delight from start to finish.",962668800,144,2888,5.236442516268981

1343867,2,B00004RER0,"I have been spoiled by watching non-American movies. I used to say European movies, but movies from South America, some parts of Asia, and even Mexico are now as good as European movies. What movies from other countries often have that American movies almost never have is subtlety. Whether it's comedy, drama, suspense, sex, or any other genre, American moviemakers assume American audiences have to be hit over the head with whatever they're watching or they won't get it.

In this movie, for example, when Son catches Dad with Girlfriend in Hotel, then when Dad and Son catch Younger Gay Son in Cabin, EVERYBODY has to overact, so that the audience will be sure to get the point that bad stuff is happening. Why, oh why does Hollywood think we're stupid? Is it because we are? Maybe. In any case, this movie's drama is far too heavy-handed for me.

In less than ten minutes, I already know everything there is to know about these three characters, and I'm willing to bet the ""twists"" other reviewers rave about are the same oh-so-predictable ""twists"" Hollywood has been delighting noise-deafened, brain-dulled audiences with since Witness for the Prosecution 60 years ago. I'd much rather have to take time and figure out for myself what's going on between characters than be hit so hard by the director and actors with such a heavy drama hammer that it leaves me reeling and nauseous.",1339286400,2,1388,4.8277310924369745
1343868,3,B00004RER0,"Were it not for the gay angle, this film could be called a compendium of escaped convict movie cliches. If the Jason Behr character had been a woman rather than a gay man, there would be little to distinguish this plot from literally dozens of films of the 1950s and early 1960s.
Limited almost entirely to a single set, the interior of a vacation cabin in the woods, the script seems more for a stage play than a film.
Jason Behr is very appealing as an unappealing character whose life seems marked by poor judgment and bad decisions. The supporting cast is generally first rate.
Director Victor Salva knows how to generate suspense and how to keep things moving, but this one doesn't pass much beyond 'Made for TV' quality.",1322524800,2,726,4.592307692307692

1343878,4,B00004RER0,"This film somehow managed to escape my attention until now.  I rented it with modest expectations, but I was glued to the screen.

Perhaps there are some imperfections in this little gem, but the minor flaws are far outweighed by a great cast, fast pacing, you'll-never-guess-what-happens-next story telling, and drama in spades.

Now drama can get old fast, but this film works. If you're uncomfortable with gay sub-plots, this film probably isn't for you; there are several, and they're key to the story.  But If you're okay with coming-out issues, struggles between sons and sons and fathers, and a considerable amount of bloodshed, I'd check this out.

There's enough drama, conflict, deception, plot twists, secrets, and baggage here to fill a week of soap operas, but it's served up here sensitively and with some meaning.  Highly recommended.  Check it out.",1163808000,4,864,5.128571428571429

1343880,3,B00004RER0,"Rites of Passaage, directed by Victor Salva, is a movie about Del (Dean Stockwell) coming to tems with the mistakes he made with Campbell (Jason Behr) his gay son. The past is revealed to the viewer in flashbacks and you begin to understand the past trouble as Del is a tough guys guy and viewed his son kissing and hugging another man. Thrown into this brew is some action/suspense when you have a psychopathic killer /escape convict (James Remar) and his sidekick hiding out around the moutain cabin where Del and his sons are camping out. As the stories twist and turns more secets are exposed under the light of truth and characters are seen with a whole new perspective.

The movie has several good points: the beautiful lake and forest sets for a secluded postcard appearance, the actors are all easy on the eyes and the script is not over acted. However, what knocked a few stars off was even though the acting was fine the script directs the father to have this soul searching / big hearted change for his son (even after 2 years of silence), not to mention that Del and Campbell go back and forth at yelling which really doesn't lead to anything but exhaustion for both the script and the viewer. Also, the whole idea of Campbell having something to do with the convict was a stretch to including the boat scene (why go out on it in the first place).

1343884,2,B00004RER0,"This film is much better acted than written. The five leads (Dean Stockwell, Jason Behr, James Remar, Robert Keith and Jaimz Woolvett) may not be major feature film actors, but all do a respectable job and create a certain suspense and atmosphere. And Heaven knows, it's not easy to act when your character is poorly written.
The main problem is the premise itself: gay son of macho father, who has chased son's lover away (lover then dies without son ever seeing him again), starts to write letters to a relative of the dead lover, who is in prison for being a rotten person. Through their letters they develop a ""deep"" relationship. Now it's time for the pen-pal to break out of prison, with a gay cellmate in tow, grab gay son - who is willing to be his accomplice - and the money that he buried before he went up the river (yes, the old bury the money routine!). Unfortunately, macho father shows up unexpectedly with straight brother at the family's log cabin in the woods, where the gay son is meeting his fugitives (talk about your bad timing!). Gay son's fugitive pen-pal now decides to have ""fun"" with macho dad and brother. Suddenly things get out of hand, tied up - so to speak - and the gay son, just can't quite figure out how to get his pen-pal back on the right track. In the end, he basically has to kill him (lets him drown, actually) and stoically goes off the jail, because now macho dad has become super pappa, who loves him to bits!
Boy, what some guys won't do to get their fathers' attention!
The other problem here is the fact that homosexuals are displayed as either stupid, criminal, psychopathic or all three. The film tries hard to be a legitimate ""I-want-my-father-to-love-me-even-though-I'm-a-queer-film"", but just can't pull it off without making gays look like the outcasts that their fathers think they are. Victor Salva (writer/director) obviously hasn't realized that some macho dads dislike the fact that their sons are homosexual, even though their sons are intelligent, good-hearted people, who are assets to society - not like the creeps in his film!",1008460800,20,2089,4.741758241758242

1343886,5,B00004RER0,"I really, really liked this movie the first time I saw it.  I still liked it a lot the second time, but I had to admit that the lead character, Campbell (Jason Behr), had to be exceptionally stupid for this plot to work.  However, as I was able to justify that stupidity in the context of his character, I can pretty much forgive it.
I don't want to give away too much about the plot in my review as the movie works best the less you know about it going in.  The basic premise is a father and two sons for the first time in years are reunited at a remote cabin in the woods.  As a lifetime of wrongs and hurts are confronted, two escaped convicts arrive at the door.  Why are they there?  What is their connection to the younger son?  That's all I want to say about the plot.
This is a truly suspenseful thriller.  Writer/director Victor Salva uses the remote location to maximum advantage in order to keep the tension high.  But what really makes this movie stand out are the family relationships that drive all the characters.  Secrets upon secrets are revealed at an exciting pace, and just when you think you know it all, something else is revealed.  This is one severely dysfunctional family, indeed.
The performances are all solid, and standing out are Dean Stockwell as the father (he is also one of the producers of the movie) and Jason Behr as Campbell, the younger son.
If I have one misgiving about the film, it's that Campbell does come across as incredibly nave/stupid.  However, if you look at his character as being in search of a father figure, you can almost forgive his stupidity.
The DVD is in letterbox format and does have a commentary track by Behr & Salva.  I haven't listened to that yet, so I will amend my review once I have done so.  I do look forward to hearing what they have to say about the making of his truly exciting thriller.
If you like this, you might also like John Greyson's intriguingly experimental ""Lilies"", the less appealing but still interesting French film ""Criminal Lovers"", and/or the flawed but entertaining ""In the Flesh.""

1343889,3,B00004RER0,"I enjoyed this movie. Really, I did.
But to say it's one of the best human dramas in years is a bit of a stretch. The acting is respectable enough, with all of the movies characters turning in solid performances. The production budget was low, given that the whole movie takes place in one location, but the director works with that limitation and creates a suspenseful movie.
Unfortunately, as with other movies with storylines that occurred way before the film ever started, I spent most of the movie trying to relate to characters who seemed to have an ""in"" on what they were talking about that I was not privy to. Only so much can be accomplished by dialogue and flashbacks.. it seems as though most of what the characters struggled with happened years before the movie's storyline began.
Nonetheless, there is some good dialogue and again, good performances by all around, but I must side with the other reviewer who said that anyone who felt this movie was ""great"" was probably just starved for a movie, ANY movie, with a gay theme.  If that's the case, there are many better ones to choose from (Jeffrey, Lost Language of Cranes, etc).",999734400,3,1142,4.681592039800995
1343890,5,B00004RER0,"""Rites of Passage"" is a finely tuned psychological thriller that does more than just keep our stomachs tightened for an hour and a half. This story of a father and his two sons being held at the whim of a convict is more than that, digging deep into its characters to give the story a much richer complexity and intrigue. As far as thrillers go, I was breathless; as far as human dramas go, I was hooked.
The film introduces us to Del Farraday (Dean Stockwell) and his son D.J. (Robert Keith), who run into one another in a San Francisco hotel. In hopes that he might quiet any objections his son may have about seeing his father with another woman, the two venture to the family lakeside cabin for a weekend of bonding. That is, until they arrive and realize that Campbell (Jason Behr), the youngest son, is also there, and immediately we get the feeling that there is bad blood between father and son.
As it turns out, it goes back years ago, when Del caught Campbell giving his heart to another boy by the name of Billy, and lost himself in rage. The two have had no contact for months at a time, so it comes as no surprise that when Del reveals his affair with another woman, an argument ensues. But any and all arguments are cast aside when two strangers arrive, who turn out to be escaped felons, one of whom has a connection to Campbell's lost Billy, and with whom Campbell has an agenda.
To reveal any more will ruin the plot's many twists and turns, though not so much the thriller ones as the emotional ones. This is one well-crafted film from Victor Salva, the director of ""Powder."" His work on that project and his work here prove his worth as a filmmaker in that he can do so much with a large budget film, and take material such as this and turn it into solid entertainment with a minimal budget.
Salva's most winning aspect of this film is his attention to the emotions of his characters, particularly Campbell, whose homosexuality fuels most of what's going on in the plot. Campbell is given the typical emotions of someone who feels empty and lonesome, but under the powerful performance of Jason Behr, these emotions are so impacting and believable that they add so much to the overall effect of the film. Salva is also careful not to turn the film into a coming-out story, but more of a story about coming to terms.
The father/son examination this film partakes is simply stunning. This human drama unfolds very effectively as Campbell and his father, played in a winning performance from Dean Stockwell, must come to terms with one another, what has happened in the past, and what is going on as they find themselves in danger. There is always some measure of loyalty that each holds for the other, and the film portrays that loyalty in such a light that nothing could ever shake it.
Another good aspect is the way in which Salva allows the psychological drama to play on those emotions. One of the escaped felons, Frank (James Remar), plays on Campbell's childhood memories of his father's disdain for him, using it as a tool to win him over and keep him loyal. Remar pushes the envelope with his witty and chilling performance, and to watch the interaction between he and Behr in the most intense moments will keep you on the edge of your seat.
While it is most definitely an unknown film, ""Rites of Passage"" will be remembered by those who see it. It not only winds the chord of suspense until the knot in your stomach is unbearable, but it gives us characters whose emotions we can identify with and understand. These emotions come out through some very strong performances, and some very provocative directing. I got so much more from this film than I expected, and hold it up as one of the best human dramas of recent years.",999129600,24,3750,4.516176470588236
1343891,5,B00004RER0,"I ordered this video just because I wanted to have a film with Jason Behr, who I admire a lot. I didn't even know he plays a gay in that film then. It was a real surprise for me as I am gay myself. Yet this fact has not made me really love the film. When I sat down in the armchair and turned the VCR on, I could not stop watching the film. Although in the very beginning the plot did not seem to catch my interest too much, the later events appeared so fast and surprising that I hardly noticed the time passing by. The whole story of young gay love is so deeply moving one's heart that , I am sure, there must be a lot of similar examples in real life when gays are not accepted in their families. Coming out is not an easy thing to to, at least in Poland. Maybe such films like ""Rites of Passage"" will change people's attitudes somehow and turn them to a better understanding. Perhaps this film has helped somebody to become aware of how worth our family relationships are.  The plot, however, is not the only good aspect of this film. I have enjoyed watching Jason Behr and Dean Stockwell act in this film. These two artists behaved like a real son and father. Jason Behr di not disappoint me at all. I must say he is a marvellous actor and ""Rites of Passage"" is the very proof of that. This film is worth its price for sure.",998265600,3,1329,4.111538461538461
1343892,4,B00004RER0,"This is a nicely constructed, well acted, lower budget movie. It gives a vivid depiction of the effects of homophobia and its resultant secrecy on family relationships and on individual behavior. Other reviewers have done a good job of describing the action and much of the acting skill shown. At its core, the movie could be viewed as projecting a fantasy of the gay son, Campbell (Jason Behr), against his father, Del (Dean Stockwell) as vengeance for the father's violent rejection of Campbell's now deceased lover, Billy. The escaped convicts Frank (James Remar) and Red (Jaimz Woolvett) get to heap various forms of abuse and violence on Del and threaten to exit with Campbell, all good revenge motifs. The curious thing is that, knowing Campbell's recent history and role in these events, Del is able to see past them and embrace his son at the end. The acting makes it convincing. Coyly-photographed Campbell gets both his revenge and his father's love. Frank gets to be the Bad Campbell. Red is a bridge from Campbell to Frank, just as D.J. (Robert Keith) is a bridge from Campbell to Del. While Behr, Stockwell, and Remar have justly received praise, Keith and Woolvett have also done a convincing job of keeping the main characters connected and sympathetic. Be sure to listen to the commentary track. Director Victor Salva and Jason Behr give a lot of information on the making of the film and the techniques used. The lighting and sound had many fine moments, as well as the actors. The deleted scenes and the stills give useful background information too.",998179200,5,1568,4.876404494382022
1343893,4,B00004RER0,"The commentary by the writer-director and lead actor is very good; fun and informative.  Overall great performances and a tight story, the type with twists and turns as happens in real life.  Most of the time you can't see the surprises coming, sometimes you can.  I think it depends upon how involved you are in thinking about the last scene that played or whether a character's attitude or dialogue is preoccuping you with a memory of something from your own life.  The movie combines drama-mystery-suspense and romance, as well as concepts of redemption and reconciliation.  The basic premise about a homosexual son who has been disenfranchised from his father and yet accidently meets up with him at the worst possible moment in their lives - with escaped-from-State-pen felons on the loose and headed their way - is a contrivance that gets the basic plot moving, so you can't resent it.  In fact, you wouldn't have much of a movie without it.  The film plays like a theatrical production, with its minimalistic sets (a cabin by the lake), but the plot and acting is so realistic you don't feel constricted.  If you like the writer-director's film POWDER (as I did) you might want to catch this one also as an example of great story-telling, but POWDER and RITES have nothing to do with each other in terms of plot.  POWDER is cosmic and RITES deeply personal.  Only two problems with this film/DVD and why I didn't rate it 5 stars: 1) There isn't more of it (more flashbacks to enjoy the characters more fully); 2) Occasionaly the characters speak in a rather florid fashion that even extremely well-educated types don't, as if they were characters in a play rather than real life.",989193600,11,1686,4.762886597938144
1343894,2,B00004RER0,"Contrary to many, I found this film to be cloying and melodramatic.  The plot and the writing often seem forced, and the performances occasionally border on the ridiculous.  I found it to be a little hard to take seriously, but I know several viewers who found it to be utterly realistic.  It is certainly gratifying to see an actor of Dean Stockwell's stature helping the genre of gay film to stretch its borders and its visibility, but this film was for me a mixed bag at best.",988934400,3,479,4.482758620689655
1343895,5,B00004RER0,"I decided to purchase this movie based on the reviews I read here on Amazon.com. I read a few reviews and right away I knew I was captured, I had to buy it.  I must say that each actor is given the role that fit them most, no one appeares out of place or out of character in the part they portray. The film is quite vivid in its delivery of past occurances, it does not bore the viewer. Even though I felt satisfied with the history of the past, I felt so touched about the situation with Billy that I wanted to learn more about his relationship with Campbell.  One has no choice but to be sympathetic to Campbell (Behr), he expresses just the right amount of emotions. This film was cleverly directed, the little bit of suspense keeps the viewer entertained. The gay issue, I feel is very well presented, many who watch the film can relate because the story is very realistic. I say realistic beacuase there are so many young, and even older gay individuals who experience similar situations with a parent's understanding of who they really are. I like the fact that this is not just a movie based on gay individuals or issues, there is actually a  very good plot. Rites of Passage is a  magnificent picture that allows the viewer to open up and feel the emotions of happiness, despair, fear and love as they flow.  I was satisfied.",986256000,9,1333,4.402439024390244

1343897,5,B00004RER0,"I bought this movie originally because Jason Behr was the star, and also because of it's theme. The movie deals with the struggle Campbell (Behr) who is recovering from the loss of his lover Billy, and the neglect of his father.
I identified with Campbell, as I too have a turbulent relationship with my father; and have also lost my partner, so by the end of this movie I was drowning in my own tears.
Behr plays the character Campbell extremely well, pushing his fantastic acting ability to the limits. He has such a fabulous way of expressing his emotions, and making you the viewer; have compassion for his character.
The DVD is excellent, deleted scenes, one  a personal fave, when Campbell goes to see his mother. Audio comments by director and Jason Behr, please buy this one!!",972000000,26,784,4.681159420289855
1343898,5,B00004RER0,"Not only is Dean Stockwell amazing, Jason Behr is magnificent! This movie shows how much Behr has blossomed as an actor (since smaller rolls in 7th Heaven).
Victor Salva is to be highly praised for directing this masterpiece. He carved his nitch when he directed the controversial film Powder (people even boycotted the movie!). Rites of Passage shows just how much he's grown.
I only wonder why when it was on the big screen it wasn't given more publicity. It's disappointing to me that people are so petrified of controversial issues. Jason Behr and the entire cast deserve much more recognition for Rites of Passage.",971308800,12,619,4.904761904761905
