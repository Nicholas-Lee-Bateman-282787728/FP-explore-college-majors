8368631,4,B002EZLOUY,"I bought this dvd because I wanted to have another film by Sara Montiel and the price was so low (I paid $3.00)  that I decided to purchase it, although I thought Sara Montiel was on both films and it turned-out she was only in one. (My fault). Both films were entertaining although not great. Despedida de Soltera is a comedy-drama Mexican film that was released in February 1966. It is one hour 30 minutes long, filmed in 35 mm, in color (Eastmancolor). I rated it a 7 out of 10.  Of the two films, I liked Ella, Lucifer y Yo better (I rated it an 8 out of 10). This Mexican film is a comedy-fantasy that was released in March of 1953 and it stars Sara Montiel. It is also 1 hour 30 minutes long and in black and white. The sound is MONO, and there is like a ""buzzing"" sound for the entire duration of the film. I supposed because it was filmed in 1953 and the technology was not that advanced then. Both films are in Spanish with no other language option and neither films offer any subtitles nor extras. Overall, it is a good purchase if you can get it for a low price, otherwise, buy the 2-films dvd of Sara Montiel that includes La Violetera and El Ultimo Cuple from 1957 and 1958 and both in color.",1397347200,,1205,4.189655172413793
8368632,4,B002EZLOUY,"Despedida De Soltera(1966) is a fun, lightweight film directed by Julian Soler. Alicia Bonet plays Marcela, a woman who is celebrating her last few hours as a single woman with her friends(played by Maricruz Olivier, Fanny Cano, Regina Torne, Sonia Infante, and Leonorilda Ochoa). Marcela starts to lose her sanity when she finds out that her fiance had a baby with another woman! Arturo De Cordova plays a God-like character who narrates parts of the story. The film is based on a play by Alfonso Anaya. Fernando Galiana wrote an adaptation of the play for the silver screen. Sergio Guerrero's music score for the film is good. There's two catchy songs performed by the film's female leads. The director was nice enough to show the female leads sunbathing and swimming! Fanny Cano was a real sensual starlet. She tragically died in a plane crash in 1983. Maricruz Olivier died in 1984. Arturo De Cordova died in the 1970's. Despedida De Soltera was released in Mexico on February 10th, 1966. The B-side movie on the DVD is Ella, Lucifer, y Yo(1953), a supernatural comedy/drama directed by Miguel Morayta.
This budget DVD is a solid package.",1326672000,3,1142,4.891752577319588

AN EXCELLENT ENSEMBLE CAST ALL BEAUTIFUL & FAMOUS ACTRESSES at the spanish box-office. Ms. ALICIA BONET, Ms. MARICRUZ OLIVIER, Ms. FANNY CANO (sexy as ever), Ms. SONIA INFANTE, Ms. REGINA TORNE, & Ms. LEONORILDA (Ochoa), ALL IN BIKINIS!! in this hilarious & entertaining fun to watch movie. All are given equal screen time without competing or upstaging each other but rather as true friends to celebrate the party. All these fine actresses achieved fame & popularity in their acting careers as leading ladies and sadly some of them are gone already (R.I.P.) I remember seen this movie back in the '60s as a teenager & what really is memorable besides all the beautiful women, is the SPANISH RENDITION OF THE SONG ""TOO MANY FISH IN THE SEA"" done as ""YA SE ALIVIO SERAFIN"" SUNG BY THE PRETTY CAST!! The colorful setting of the story in Mexico's beautiful Cuernavaca. The film & crisp sound transfer are excellent. ENJOY!
The second feature ELLA, LUCIFER Y YO (SHE, LUCIFER AND I) is good to watch only for the talents of Ms. SARA MONTIEL. A black & white film that's a strange mix of Faustus & the Invisible Man, unfurtunately it does not work as well as a comedy. Ms. Montiel made this movie while she resided in Mexico back in the '50s, then she moved to Hollywood were Ms. Montiel made VERACRUZ. Then she was offered a movie contract by one of the big film studios. Ms. Montiel declined it & she returned to her country Spain were she finally became AN INTERNATIONAL SINGING AND FILM STAR. Among her memorable films are EL ULTIMO CUPLE, LA VIOLETERA, EL ULTIMO TANGO, LA BELLA LOLA, BESAME, & many more. The stories in these films were scripted to match Ms. Montiel's beauty & truly showcased Ms. Montiel's singing & acting talents. WE ALL LOVE Ms. SARITA MONTIEL - A TRUE STAR FROM A BYGONE GOLDEN ERA WHO WILL ALWAYS LIVE IN OUR HEARTS & MEMORIES!!!",1310083200,3,2197,5.1225626740947074
