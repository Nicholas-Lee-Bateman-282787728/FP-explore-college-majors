1640867,5,B00005OATS,"I find this to be the best modern (i.e. stereo) recording of this work either on CD or DVD. The conducting by Von Karajan is both dramatically effective and lyrically sensitive, comparable, I feel, to the well known Giulini EMI recording of five years earlier, the orchestra and chorus are excellent, and the sound quality is of superior clarity, very good, moreover, by present day standards, even though this recording dates from 1967. Finally, all the four soloists are among the leading singers of Italian opera, captured in their vocal prime and in excellent voice for this recording. I take particular pleasure in Ghiaurov because with him you have a true basso voice of ample weight and resonance, not a pushed down baritone (as is Raimondi on the Abbado DVD), who also sings very expressively.
As to its video qualities, the direction by Clouzot, one of the leading French film directors of the time, skillfully keeps one focused on the salient aspects of the performance, as one of the other reviewers, Todd Kay, has explained in greater detail. The only caveat I would offer in this regard is that the colors appear to me both rather washed out and tinged with a greenish hue, but what, after all, does that really matter?
Finally, the price is less than the full priced CD sets of this work, so do yourself a favor and get this one for yourself and/or your family.",1021593600,11,1375,4.733333333333333
1640868,5,B00005OATS,"This show can be described as one of the most important moments in history of music. Maestro Verdi would REALLY be very proud.
I must confess that i bought this REquiem because i'm a huge pavarotti fan. But, what a great surprise!!! We all know the great singers that Ghiaurov, Cossoto and Price are, but they are even better than one could expect. They sing near perfection! Pavarotti is just a detail if you compare to the other solists. Ghiaurov is really a GOD! Cossoto is MUCH, MUCH better than i though she would be singing the Requiem. I'm not saying that i thought she would be inaddequate singing the Requiem, my point is that she is outstanding! Any compliment i use would not be enough to express her majesty! And Price, oh my god...!  Price is unbelievebly great!!! The concert was recorded in 1967, and it's astonishing how the quality is so good! The whole DVD is really amazing. I couldn't be more satisfied. karajan did a terrific job too ! The orchestra and chorus are fantastic! It's really hard to imagine a better  recording of the great Verdi Requiem.
BUY IT IMMEDIATELLY!!!!",1021248000,10,1096,4.644329896907217
1640869,5,B00005OATS,"Run (do not walk) out the door right now! Take this DVD home and experience the most incredible sonic experience ever. Watch Karajan weep as he merely listens to the greatest singers of our age.</p>

 To mention all the virtues of this recording would require a great deal more than 300 words. The best aspect of this recording is the absolute tightness of sound achieved by opera greats. This kind of overtone tingle usually can only be achieved through thinner, weaker voices found in most academic oratorio or chanticleer-type recordings. The fact that these well-sized voices can mingle so intimately rends my soul. Maestro Verdi would have been proud. </p>

 Any fan of these four singers must own this recording or forever have an inadequate collection. Luciano fans will love this sweet, fresh emanation, still very fluid in his traditional bel canto technique.</p>",1016841600,6,872,5.076923076923077
1640870,5,B00005OATS,"This classic film from 1967, shot in an empty Scala theater, always has been well regarded and only has gained in stature with the passage of 35 years, capturing as it did five legends in peak or at least prime form (conductor Karajan and the four towering Verdians comprising the vocal quartet), along with the Scala orchestra and its excellent chorus. The great Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov anchors the team with a performance as authoritative and disciplined as it is suave and elegant; he is in better form here than on the celebrated Giulini-conducted recording of a few years earlier. Luciano Pavarotti, looking strikingly young and clean-shaven, was a last-minute and then-little-known substitute for the great tenor Carlo Bergonzi -- a turn of events that caused some anxiety on the part of organizers -- but in the accurate words of Karajan biographer Richard Osborne, ""He sang like a god."" His opening Kyrie eleison is the first, and certainly not the last, of the performance's stirring moments. Leontyne Price delivers all of the radiant vocalism one would expect from her at this juncture of her career, and while the lower third of her voice always was a relative weakness, in 1967 she could still give a respectable accounting of the Libera Me's depths. Throughout her performance, beauty and keen involvement go hand in hand; there is no hint of routine. But if this performance ""belongs"" to any member of this quartet, if we must select a star among stars, then the laurel must go to Fiorenza Cossotto, whose rich Verdian mezzo-soprano voice is heard at its ferocious, incendiary best here, in (among other places) the Liber Scriptus of a lifetime.

Karajan's view of the score is characteristically broad and cultivated, but it is a more lively, dramatic and immediate reading than we hear on his various recorded attempts with Berlin and Vienna orchestras (one of which has been issued on Sony DVD). It is difficult to say whether this can be chalked up to the occasion or perhaps to the conductor's interpretation's being filtered through a more directly idiomatic orchestra and chorus (the Italian chorus, trained by Roberto Benaglio, puts its Viennese counterparts in the shade). There is undeniably an element of showmanship in Karajan's elaborate, fluid gestures (he directs without baton, as was his custom in the choral repertory), but I believe it would be a mistake to dismiss this as showmanship alone -- there is also evidence of enormous expressive resources, a superbly finished and graceful technique, and clear-eyed, firm-handed control of the proceedings. Whatever else he was, he was a great conductor.

The film's director, the auteur Henri-Georges Clouzot, avoids many of the common pitfalls in documenting a classical-music performance. He is anything but static; indeed, he is consistently alert and enterprising in his choices. His camera whizzes cinematically from trumpet to balcony-borne trumpet in the Dies Irae; elsewhere captures the almost humorous aside of a wind player struggling to turn the page during a hectic orchestral passage, and, in a blink-and-you-miss-it felicity, finds Karajan (via stern facial expression and ""whoa"" gesture) reining in an unseen participant who apparently was about to jump a cue. On occasion, Clouzot also makes the interesting decision to ""anticipate"" a singer's entrance by several seconds, treating us to such sights as the regal Price standing motionless and awaiting a cue in the Offertorio, then finally letting loose with a perfectly shaped, shimmeringly beautiful ""E"" -- an ecstatic moment.

The transfer looks to be a video-to-DVD job, and this will disappoint those who had hoped for a ground-up remastering from the original film elements. To be frank, the quality is inconsistent from section to section, with blacks and flesh tones variable, and at times generalized fading or flickering. Nevertheless, this is probably the best the film has looked in a home-video format, and it always has been marked by a relative pictorial softness. One may well feel its mellow visuals are appropriate to the ""time capsule"" allure it has acquired with the passage of years. The audio news is happier: the highs are generally firm and accommodating (no small matter in a recording featuring such singers as Price and Cossotto), and the sonic blend is decidedly better than on the VHS version, whose obtrusive tape hiss shall not be missed. It is somewhat bass-light, but the timpani has an assertive presence at key moments, and definition is at least decent -- through high-end headphones, I could easily isolate various instruments in the mix.

In sum, incidental caveats (mostly on the video level) aside, this is a treasurable performance; essential viewing/listening for admirers of these singers, this conductor, or simply the magnificent work to which they gave their best in January 1967. Priced significantly lower than full-price audio-only recordings of the Verdi Requiem (only a fraction of which rival the artistic quality of this one), it represents a bargain of which I advise readers to take advantage with haste.",1006732800,35,5114,5.195151515151515
7948666,5,B00005OATS,"Madame Price is majestic and her sound is sumptuous. The young Pavarotti,Madame Cossotto and stentorian Ghiaurov are wonderful. Maestro von Karajan is his usual embarrassingly egotistical and self-congratulatory self.  As example of his egomania, watch and listen to Pavarotti singing Ingemisco while the camera stays on von Karajan's hands as though he were a ballerina...cringe-worthy behaviour.",1413158400,,397,6.089285714285714
7948667,3,B00005OATS,"I had high expectations in view of the assembled artists, the venue and special occasion of this performance, and of Maazel's interpretation. The production itself is quite beautiful: recorded in the Basilica di San Marco in Venice in November 2007, it highlights the cathedral's splendor, the reverent audience, the soloists, orchestra and chorus with near-perfect cinematography. The soundtrack is also acceptable, which may have been quite a task to achieve, given the Basilica's over-reverberant acoustics. Alas, the performance itself does not rise to the occasion. Despite the occasional minor insecurity in ensemble and a visible lack of joy, the Symphonica Toscanini musicians play well, the Coro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino members sing equally well, and the soloists are more than adequate, almost tangibly trying to excel. The star among the four is the luminous mezzo-soprano Anna Smirnova who seems to provide some of the cues for her fellow-soloists. What is missing, however, from beginning to end is an energetic and inspiring presence on the podium. Maazel beats the time without any display of emotion and involvement in the music. His tempi are unconvincing at times and not consistent with the entire score's inner dynamics. Quite a few sharp rhythmic accents are leveled, some highly devotional and expressive passages appear strangely bland. When the musicians look at the conductor for direction, his gestures are often vague. Throughout the performance, his dour expression does not change. Against convention, he does not use a score, and there might be moments when he lacks the firm grip on the proceedings necessary for the realization of this huge and complex work. Perhaps he was indisposed--or he just is not deeply moved by the Requiem. The performance strikes me as musically flawed, and I can not recommend it with enthusiasm. If you want the heart and the soul of this great work in a superb interpretation on DVD, get Abbado's 2001 Berlin recording (EMI Classics).",1275091200,9,2003,5.282131661442007
7948668,3,B00005OATS,"None of Maazel's soloists (Fantini, Smirnova, Meli and Siwek) entirely disappoints. My major complaint is that the acoustics of the Basilica di San Marco (Venice) are uncomfortably reverberant: the Chorus of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (especially in 'Sanctus' and 'Agnus Dei') sounds messy (too many post-echoes) and is always drowned by the crystal-clear Symphonica Toscanini (for the first time, I am aware of hidden orchestral gems that I couldn't hear on any other recording). Maazel's score-less conducting is erratic (89 minutes): 'Dies Irae' and its refrains are rushed, but elsewhere he adopts leisurely tempi that sometimes become anticlimactic (lasting more than 7 minutes, the final section of 'Libera me' - from the fugue onwards - is desperately slow, not at all uplifting). 3 1/2 stars.",1260489600,9,804,5.44
7948669,5,B00005OATS,"Not much to say but what we have here is the definitive recording of the great Verdi Requiem. I own two releases and this 2001 of the actual recording of 1967 is by far superior with audio to the 2005.  The 2005 release video quality is extremely clear but lacks a little in audio quality.  Both are worth owning; however, if you can get the 2001 over the 2005 release you would be more pleased.

Price, Gihiaurov, and von Karajan are as close to perfection as one could get. Cossoto is great and I was totaly unaware of her before this recording.  However, if you listen closely you'll hear her having some difficulties vocally in two areas.  You'll have to hear and find out for yourself. Pavarotti was too nervous and stiff for me and I wish a more seasoned tenor could have been chosen. However, he possessed the voice in spite of his stage presence.

My disappointment is that Von Karajan allowed the chorus to accompany Price as she soared to those beautiful notes in the Libera Me.  Trust me; she needed no help.  It would have been the icing on the cake if she had been allowed to do it alone.  I would have loved to have seen her soar alone as well!!!

The orchestra and chorus were simply amazing.",1170979200,,1207,4.396396396396397
7948670,5,B00005OATS,"There are 13 additional components of this production never noted and 2 of the 4 vocalists and the producer are mentioned only by name. I send this review to Amazon.com with enormous conflict because so much that might have and should have been said to represent this work is missing. But in keeping with the need for brevity my thoughts are whittled down to these. My apologies to the artists and producer.

Title: ""Eternal Richness Unlikely Ever to be Surpassed""

This performance portrays a special kind of beauty, elegance and dignity. There is always the precisely coordinated handiwork of von Karajan conducting with smooth elegant energy that reverberates throughout the artists work.  No beats are missed here. One gets the sense that the chorus at La Scala consist exclusively of ""stand alone"" soloists with talent not unequal to that of the featured soloists in the quartet. Their accompaniment by the La Scala Orchestra and its powerful magnitude offers the listener one of those rare privileges to experience on this earth. To combine them for a performance of Verdi's Requiem is a most exquisite marriage.

""The Requiem"" is made up of highly magnificent orchestral accompaniment just as a matter of course. But it should be of special note to mention here the Tuba mirum, an especially exhilarating presentation. It features the powerful woodwinds that includes pairs of trumpeters performing while stationed from balcony locations in the theater.

The choral components of this production are rich showcases for top vocalists as they perform solos alone as well as duets, trios, and quartets with each other. There is Luciano Pavarotti prior to his days as the superstar that he became. His opening presentation of the Kyrie eleison is -""less Pavarotti""- than his later solo performance of the Ingemisco. Here we can hear him as we now know him. All four members of the quartet which includes Fiorenza Cossotto, Leontyne Price, and Nicolai Ghiaurov, as well as Pavarotti, are especially magnificently blended in the Offertorio. As the Offertorio comes to a close there is the sense that we have reached ""THE"" peak in terms of beauty for our ears. But, of course, there is much more to even exceed this.

If one is in search of ""THE MOST"" compellingly moving and beautiful part of the performance, the Libera me seems to be it. Leontyne Price does the honors as we would expect her to do with the Requiem aeternam portion of the Libera me. Here she is able to linger over a part that is exquisitely written and executed. This part is clearly a showcase for the Soprano whose role it seems to be to take us to ""THE"" final magnificent culmination. It has been said that Verdi wrote this composition with this particular expectation for his Soprano. As the Libera me continues to the final Libera me domine, the La Scala O and C combine to take us to ""THE MOST"" magnificent culmination. As the full impact of the orchestral brass is joined by the sopranos in the Chorus, I would like to have heard Price's ""Soprano"" highlighting it all. This, however, does not happen at La Scala. We are left with no sight or sound at this point of Price until she returns to do the final plea for deliverance. Thankfully, in the 2001 performance of ""The Verdi"" with Angela Gheorghiu singing and Claudio Abbado conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, we are lead to this magnificent culmination by ""the"" Soprano. Her voice is the jewel in the crown of the Chorus at Berlin. In this 1967 production with von Karajan and Clouzot there was for me this one disappointment but hardly is it a negative. It is more a matter of personal taste.

Finally, this is Verdi's Requiem. Classical music doesn't get any better than this. This is La Scala. They are believed by most to be without peer. This is a production that brings beauty, elegance and dignity to music that results in an eternal richness unlikely to ever be surpassed.",1122336000,4,3912,4.838565022421525
7948671,5,B00005OATS,"One cannot imagine a finer ensemble, in better prime than those featured on this DVD.  Price's interpretation of Verdi's Requiem has been hailed in its various audio recordings and her superb soprano soars in this film, sending shivers down one's spine and reminding us why she was regarded as one of the finest musical artists of the last century.  The young, rather svelt Pavarotti is also in wonderful voice, with a somewhat sweeter tone than he exhibited in his later years.  The rare treat of these two great performers singing together is unavailable on any other DVD, with the exception of a single duet contained in the Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala DVD.  This alone merits the purchase price.

Strong vocal support is added by Fiorenza Cossotto and Nicolai Ghiaurov, both at vocal heights of their careers.  Von Karajan, whose mastery of Verdi's scores is undisputed, leads the orchestra of LaScala and the soloists in an emotional and exciting interpretation of one of the composer's greatest works.

Finally, films of such performances risk being dull; thanks to the ingenious directing of Henri-Georges Clouzot, best known for his magnificent film ""Diabolique,"" this DVD is not only musically astounding but visually compelling.  Any fan of any of these great artists should not hesitate to add this film to his or her collection.",1095724800,3,1347,5.1187214611872145
7948672,5,B00005OATS,"Martha, sell all my clothes I've just died and gone to heaven! (That was my reaction after viewing and hearing this performance of Verdi's Requiem.) My god what a performance this video is. The words ""Golden age"" does NOT begin to describe what is on this DVD. If Leontyne Price's glorious voice does not dissolve you to tears you do not have a heart!! The sound of her voice soaring over (and I mean over) the orchestra and chorus had me prostrate on the floor completely dissolved in tears. (Good thing I wasn't at a live concert; it would have been rather embarrassing.) In this performance, she proves, once again that she was the greatest Verdian soprano that there has ever been--period. (END of the discussion!)
Cossotto has never been a particular favorite of mine; however, she truly shines in this video giving a most moving account of her music. Perhaps Karajan kept her in line getting the very best, from her that she had. Her voice blends very well with Price's voice. Their duet is exquisite.
A very young (pre-superstar status) Pavarotti looks scared to be in front of Karajan and surrounded by some of the world's greatest singers, of the time, gives a wonderful performance singing with sweetness and care even if he is glued to his score. He shows why he was to become superstar material.
Ghiaurov sounds like rolls of thunder anchoring the whole quartet of soloist with his deep resounding bass voice.
 Karajan seems to be literally pulling out the beautiful sound of the orchestra, soloist and chorus, with his bare hands. He even sheds tears when Leontyne is singing--who wouldn't?
If you love beautiful music and want to hear what a once-in-a-lifetime performance is all about, run (don't walk!) and get this DVD. It will change your life or in the least make it so much better, and isn't that what music is all about?",1084492800,15,1841,4.735202492211838
7948673,5,B00005OATS,"Despite its being over 30 years old, this recording is quite possibly the best one available.  AND the DG engineers did a super job restoring it.  The sound and the picture are both very very good.  The singers... where I begin?  They're all downright phenomenal.  Price and Cossotto both have incredibly creamy soaring voices.  While very different in timbre, they blend with astounding beauty.  Just look at their faces -- they are so clearly inspired by the Higher power, it's a pure joy to watch! Nicolai Ghiaurov is truly The voice of God here, his immense basso used to earth-shattering effect. To top it off, this video has very young Luciano Pavarotti singing with rare sensitivity and real feeling.  Back then, Pavarotti was a relative newcomer, while the rest of the principals were already well-established singers.  But, while no doubt aware of it, he really focused on the music and his fresh lyric tenor rings with silvery brilliance.
Von Karajan is shown at his best here.  You can clearly see the care for the singers and for the music, and his obvious enjoyment is a pleasure to behold. Don't delay in getting this DVD!",1062633600,6,1136,4.809278350515464
7948674,5,B00005OATS,"This is supreme music supremely achieved.  I have always loved Karajan's work, his musical refinement and depth. Watching him on this video and listening to it, I understand him better now.  He seems sometimes in ecstasy and in utter awe of what he is in the process of molding into the most superb artistic achievement, and never so much as when he is directing and listening to Leontyne Price.  At these moments, he seems rapt in prayer at the unbeleivably gorgeous beauty and sublimity of her voice and performance.  Seeing Price and Cossotto standing there and soaring away without sheet music in front of them is astonishing and proves the point that the best music making is done when the performer knows the work by heart.  The gentlemen here are worthy collaborators in this unbelievable structuring of unqualifed greatness in solo and ensemble performance.  Orchestra and chorus are on the mark of sheer beauty.  This is a spine-tingling, both arms, back of the neck, chill-bump splendor.  If you don't have this DVD, you need to go get it!  Do your heart and soul a favor.",1061769600,2,1082,4.805405405405406
