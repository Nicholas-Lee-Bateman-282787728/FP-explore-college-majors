8249423,1,B0007TKOZA,"The entire premise of this movie is to teach children some ""lessons"" about divorce and separation.
This might have been achieved if only they clung to the entire ideal of the Sylvanian Families, and their kind hearted nature, and love of the forest! Instead some of  these little creatures are outright indigent, wholly selfish and unkind! They steal from each-other for goodness sake!

Not only that, but these ""lessons"" on dealing with divorce are just bizarre! Each one ends in a sort of trivial and trite manner, almost too quickly, leaving you wonder what just happened, what you were supposed to have learned, and so on...

The only thing this DVD is sure to do is to taint the pure and lovely image of the sylvanian families. I implore you not to purchase it...even if it only a dollar!

Oh, and BTW my copy came with sticky old tape goo on it, and hairs clinging to it.....just sayin'....ew!",1356912000,,899,4.670886075949367
