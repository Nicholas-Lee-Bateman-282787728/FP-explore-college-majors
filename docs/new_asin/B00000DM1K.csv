7905961,1,B00000DM1K,"I  once had a tape with this title that was more of a documentry. This wasn't it. Weak story line and poor acting, no wonder I had to buy it on VHS.",1356480000,,148,3.625
7905962,4,B00000DM1K,"Although a TV movie and looking very much like it, this Titanic picture is quite entertaining and leaves the audience with an accurate emotional impact of the tragedy. The acting, especially from Cloris Leachman as Molly Brown, is most excellent. The script is nicely paced and organized to create high sympathy for the likeable people who died in the sinking of the unsinkable ship. One of the most heartbreaking sequences is when the crying baby is sitting on the wet floor of the Titanic while it's sinking. High quality entertainment.",1074124800,9,538,4.988888888888889
7905963,3,B00000DM1K,"Typical of most such movies, the first hour is spent introducing the characters and plots, in this case, a few romances among passengers.  There is little focus on the crew -- the heroes.  The sinking wasn't technically accurate, but more importantly, doesn't portray the confussion and freezing temperatures that added to the disaster.  The scenes in the lifeboats are VERY brief.  It does try to leave the viewer with the true impact of the tragedy with the numbness of the passegers at rescue and ice in the water.  shiver",972172800,,525,4.853932584269663
7905964,1,B00000DM1K,"Cloris Leachman plays Molly Brown (I liked Cloris Leachman in Mary Tyler Moore, but Molly Brown she is not)!  Very poorly done movie on the story of the Titanic.  And just like the 1953 film (with Barbara Stanwyck) and the  1997 version (with Leonardo Dicaprio), the movie is set around a love story  (and even it's not very good). Bad acting, bad everything!  There are many  great films and documentary's about the tragic voyage - this is not one of  them.  Also stars David Janssen and Susan St. James.",959299200,2,505,4.595505617977528
7905965,3,B00000DM1K,"I saw this film at least thirteen years ago and I'm positive that in those thirteen years that have passed, there has not been one day that I haven't thought about it, or at least some scenes from it.  This film really stood  out.  It is by far the most memorable version of the Titanic legacy put on  film.  The craftmanship of the filming was outstanding, and the way the two  main characters were actively involved in their surroundings always  intrigued me.  The actors seem to be more realistic and alluring in their  portrayal of lovers aboard the ill-fated ship compared to the glitz and  glamor surrounding Jim Cameron's hyped-up version of the tragedy.  A truly  great film.",939168000,3,683,4.694915254237288
