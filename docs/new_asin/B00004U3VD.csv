1354130,5,B00004U3VD,"There is a review posted giving this movie 1 star, saying that it destroys americas youth. I am one of americas youth, and this movie has not done anything harmful to me or even made me think or act poorly on anything that they are accusing these films of doing. This movie does not do anything of the sort.  It is an interesting movie which is fun to watch and even kinda provacative.  I give it 3.5 stars, but i gave it 5 stars because i needed to raise the average because that one reveiw unfairly lowered it too much.  If you like snoop and gangsta flicks, rent this movie you should enjoy the film.  At the very least it deserves a rent.",970790400,4,642,4.195121951219512
1354131,3,B00004U3VD,"All I really have to say is that the production of these movies should not  be stopped. If you don't like the content or the language or if you just  plan don't like it, than just don't buy it. I'm so sick of hearing people  wine about the content in movies and music. Maybe I should say it again in  case you missed it, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE MOVIE, DON'T BUY THE MOVIE!",968716800,2,370,3.9594594594594597

7923607,2,B00004U3VD,"BEFORE YA EVEN PICK THIS MOVIE UP, YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT THE ACTING IS GONNA BE TERRIBLE AND THE FILMING IS GONNA BE CHEAP. BUT, SOMETIMES, IT'S SO STUPID THAT IT GETS FUNNY. BEFORE HE RETIRES FROM ''THE GAME'', A GANG LORD [SNOOP DOGG] DOES ONE FINAL JOB. BUT, HIS HOMEBOY [TRAY DEEE] SETS HIM UP FOR A MURDER HE DIDN'T COMMIT. WANTING REVENGE, HE BREAKS OUT OF JAIL AND GOES ON THE HUNT FOR THE MAN WHO SENT HIM TO JAIL AND KIDNAPPED HIS GIRL. STUPID BUT UNDENIABLY FUNNY. I WAS GON GIVE THIS MOVIE 1 STAR AT FIRST, BUT AFTER REALIZING HOW FUNNY IT WAS, I DECIDED TO RAISE IT BY 1 MORE STAR. THUGS, MOST FANS OF SNOOP DOGG, AND MOST FANS OF GANGSTA MOVIES WILL LIKE THIS. BUT OTHERS NEEDN'T EVEN BOTHER.",1062892800,3,712,4.204379562043796
