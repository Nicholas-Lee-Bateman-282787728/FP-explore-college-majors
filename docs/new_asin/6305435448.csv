7889380,5,6305435448,"This is an excellent video for the competing karatekas out there.

The video is professionally produced -- footage is of excellent quality for a VHS and the camera work is superb.

The instructors have several years of competing and coaching under their (black) belts and it certainly shows.

You will learn basic kicks, combinations, fakes and counterattacks with kicks in this part of the series -- all professionally demonstrated at slow and full speed. Meanwhile, the narrator will explain the important aspects of each technique.

As the other reviewer, I also recommend getting the entire series:

""Winning Competition Karate"" - VHS

""Winning Counterattacks"" - VHS

""Winning Kicking Techniques"" - VHS

I also strongly recommend DVDs by Alexandre Biamonti, WKF World and European Champion:

""Karate - The Art of Fighting""

""Competition Winning Techniques by Alexandre Biamonti""",1162425600,,882,5.466666666666667
