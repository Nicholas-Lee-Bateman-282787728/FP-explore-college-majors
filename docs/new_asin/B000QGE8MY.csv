2838406,4,B000QGE8MY,id probably give this movie a 3.5. a 4 is a bit generous. well the movie was pretty good. it was a bit different since shaggy and scooby were separated from the gang. however the monster was pretty obvious at the end.,1189209600,,217,4.190476190476191
2838407,3,B000QGE8MY,"This movie features the whole Mystery, Inc. gang, although Scooby and Shaggy feature prominently in the first half.  The duo gets stranded in the Himalayas with some locals, and they all soon meet up with the abominable snowman.  My son (age 4) likes this one, but it's not his favorite, since he seems to prefer the ones with scarier monsters (ghost pirates and mummies as seen in other Scooby movies).  This one does have some cool new music, and it even features a funny scene where Shaggy (aka Casey Kaseem) tries his hand a being a d.j.  It's a clever nod to those of us who remember Casey's days on the radio.  Finally, the resolution of ""who is the abominable snowman?"" turns out to be typical Scooby.",1189036800,10,708,4.543307086614173

2838424,3,B000QGE8MY,"Released in 2007, CHILL OUT SCOOBY-DOO is the eleventh in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.

Fred, Daphne, and Velma are on vacation in Paris, and awaiting the arrival of Shaggy and Scoobybut Shaggy and Scooby have been kidnapped by French hunter and adventurer Alphonse LeFleur, who drops them by parachute into the Himalayans.  Fortunately, Shaggy manages to get out a cell call to Fred, who uses his own high-tech phone to trace the location of the call.  When the three arrive in the Himalayans to rescue Shaggy and Scooby, they also meet a strange holy man, a peculiar professor, old friend Dell Chillman (from LOCH NESS MONSTER), and a fearsome abominable snowman!

Scooby-Doo movies are usually entertaining, and this one is no exception, with the film referencing several plot points of the novel and film LOST HORIZON to good effect.  Even so, this is not as imaginative as the best of series, with the solution to the mystery surprisingly transparent.  Fun nonetheless.

It's more toned down than other movies such as zombie island, which is arguably one of the best but is scary for the younger set.  Overall, this is fun and relatively light.  Good for my 3 and 4 year old.  Scooby can do no wrong in their eyes!  Which makes me happy since I've always been a fan.",1383004800,,438,4.154761904761905

I had doubts because it has not been announced or released for Bluray yet.
The DVD was 4:3 but i took a chance.

The HD rental IS a real HD scan of the original Widescreen production.
If you checked the wikipedia of this one you would confirm that it was originally done in WS but released in Full Frame 4:3 because of the prevailing TV at the time.",1358380800,2,564,4.155963302752293

2838610,4,B000QGE8MY,"Chill Out Scooby Doo! begins with the gang in Paris vacationing wondering where Scooby and Shaggy are. Shaggy and Scooby are in a small plane that they think is going to Paris. It's really going to the Himalayas to drop off Alphonse LaFleur, famous French hunter. Alphonse thinks that since Mystery Inc. is good about attracting all kinds of monsters that Scoob and Shag are perfect for leading The Yeti(whom he's hunting) to him.

If it seems like your typical Scooby Doo episode, that's because it sorta' is. See, the movie itself is based on three episodes of Scooby Doo, Where are You!. That's Snow Ghost!, The Ghost of Bigfoot, and There's No Creature Like Snow Creature. It takes place in the Himalayas and features the Abominable Snowman. It's dedicated to Iwao Takamoto who worked on the Original series. It's the eleventh Scooby-Doo movie in the direct-to-video film series. It's voiced by an all-star cast such as: Frank Welker, Casey Kasem, Mindy Cohn, Alfred Molina, Grey DeLisle, Ren Auberjonois, and Kim Mai Guest among others.

I hate to admit it, it's not quite one of my all-time favorites. Even so, it's definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a hardcore Scooby fan. I enjoyed watching it. It was a good mystery to try and figure out.

2838613,3,B000QGE8MY,"When this film (great one, by the way) was shown in Sweden last year, it was shown in the widescreen 16x9 format. Why the **** is this presented in 4x3 in the US??? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

And, again, why?

Why this constant disrespectful treatment of 1) the makers of these films, who create in widescreen, creating beautiful and dramatic shots, and 2) the viewers? Thank God I recorded and then burned Chill Out on DVD!!

This is an affront!

Oh, by the way, did I mention that I hate the 4x3 format, when not original?

Thought so.

5 stars for the film, two down for the 4x3 presentation",1256515200,,648,4.31404958677686
2838614,5,B000QGE8MY,"My 6 year old son is learning to conquer his fears by exposure to Scooby Doo and the Gang.  He really loves that there is a person in a monster suit rather than a real monster.  This flick fits the bill quite well.  Very entertaining, great music, lots of goofy Scooby and Shaggy antics.  Just what the 6 year old brain loves to see again and again.  And the monster, though scary, is explained somewhat reasonably and rationally at the end.  Perfect Scooby Dooby Doo!",1247443200,,468,4.447058823529412

2838637,4,B000QGE8MY,"Shaggy and Scooby get on the wrong plane when en route to meet the rest of the Mystery Inc. gang in Paris and end up lost in the Himalayas while an abdominal snowman is on the loose. There is the usual amount of suspects and motives but it's just fresh enough to prevent the plot from becoming tiresome.

The animation just gets better and better with each entry in the Scooby-Doo series and the bright colors and active sound design are a long way from the grainy TV show back in 1969 (though that still has its charm). Fans of the series will be glad to hear that the character of Dell Chillman from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-and-the-Loch-Ness-Monster/dp/B00022XE4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster</a>&nbsp;returns for this one, giving some continuity to the otherwise unrelated mysteries.

I must admit that I preferred it when the monsters ended up being real but I guess that each mystery has its own logic and you'll be surprised at who is behind the mask of the adorable snowman.

Keep 'em coming, Warner. That ol' Great Dane could live to a hundred.

What does really bug me is that this movie was drawn and framed in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and Warner only offers a Full Frame DVD. This is completely unacceptable behavior in 2008, especially since a couple of the previous animated movies were released in anamorphic widescreen here in the UK. The sound is in Dolby 5.1 and a small amount of extras are included.

These would look great on Blu Ray, btw. Hint! Hint!",1218758400,,1565,5.027027027027027

2838639,2,B000QGE8MY,"Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, (# 1) ""Zombie Island"" was arguably the best. (# 2) ""Witch's Ghost"" was a great runner up. (# 3) ""Alien Invasion"" had its moments. I did not much like (# 4) ""Cyber Chase."" (# 5) ""Legend of the Vampire"" was surprisingly good. (# 6) ""Monster of Mexico"" was weak, but it had its moments. (# 7) ""Loch Ness Monster"" was interesting. I did like (# 8) ""Aloha Scooby Doo."" (# 9) ""Where's My Mummy?"" was pretty good. (# 10) ""Pirates Ahoy"" quickly became one of my all time favorites.

After the GREAT 10th chapter ""Pirates Ahoy,"" I was hoping this 11th chapter would be as good or better. Sadly, I found it to fall short of ""Pirates Ahoy"" in many ways. The story starts with Fred, Velmah, and Daphne enjoying a vacation in France. But somehow, Scooby and Shaggy have ended up in the frozen lands of the Abominable Snowman. So, Fred, Daphne, and Velmah have their vacation plans changed (as usual).

Shaggy and Scooby meet some archaeologists, who seem to be afraid of the possible presence of the Abominable Snowman. I don't deny that there are some good moments. Scooby and Shaggy run into Del Chilman (from ""Loch Ness Monster""). He is a weatherman. He is still a bit strange, but he has mellowed significantly. (Ok. He grew a little since we last saw him.)

Without giving the ending away, there is a cute deviation from the typical monster formula. But one character is made out to be the bad guy, and he really didn't do anything illegal. Overall, this 11th chapter lacks the tight unity, suspense, misleads, and comical moments of many of Scooby's other movies. (""Zombie Island"" and ""Pirates Ahoy"" especially.)

I don't deny it had its moments. And it was nice to see Del Chilman again. But it was a sad way to follow ""Pirates Ahoy.""",1209427200,3,1773,4.54858934169279

This movie features the return of Fan Favorite Del Chillman previously seen in Scooby Doo and The Loch Ness Monster as a Nessy fanatic, who provides some comic relief. Del is equally funny in Chill Out: Scooby Doo. Shaggy, Daphne and Velma provided some of Chill Out: Scooby Doo's best lines.
