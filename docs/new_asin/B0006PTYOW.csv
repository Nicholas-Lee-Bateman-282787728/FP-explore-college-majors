8042187,5,B0006PTYOW,Allan Bennett's collection of Talking Heads is one of this playwright's great achievements. His insights into British society are beyond description and if you like theatre then this is as close as you are going to get to understanding what that inner sense of being British means. We never tire of watching this collection which is why I have given it the highest rating.,1465689600,2,372,4.828125

8042190,5,B0006PTYOW,"This 3 DVD set combines author Alan Bennett's wonderful 6 part series of monologues for the BBC called ""Talking Heads"" which aired in 1988, the sequel - consisting of another six monologues done ten years later, called (not very imaginatively) ""Talking Heads 2"", and a
series of short monologues performed by Bennett himself about his youth, called ""Telling Tales"", which aired in 2000.

The two ""Talking Heads"" series have the same basic format; the pieces range from 25 to 40 minutes.  These wonderful character sketches
are very simply done.  The actors speak directly into the camera, in very basic sets that look designed more for stage, than film.  No
pretense of naturalistic reality here.

In the first series, there are 5 pieces for women, performed by some of the best actresses around; Maggie Smith, Thora Hird, Patricia Routledge, Julie Walters and Stephanie Cole.  The lone piece for a male is performed by Bennett himself, who acquits himself quite admirably.  I usually think of him as a writer first, actor second, but he does a terrific and touching job performing as well.
It's especially wonderful to see Maggie Smith getting to play a character so subtle and understated.  While she has always had tremendous
range, in recent years much of what she has done has been on the broader side.  So being reminded of just how powerfully quiet she can be is a treat.

In ""Talking Heads 2"" , once again there are 5 female and 1 male character in the group. And once again the acting is at a very high level,
bringing these works to touching, funny, and occasionally very disturbing life. Bennett manages to get all the details right, to find the poetry, comedy and tragedy in day to day life and in everyday people.  And the best are amazing. This time around, the monologues are performed by Patricia Routledge, Eileen Atkins, Julie Walters, Thora Hird, Penelope Wilton as the five women and David Haig as the lone male voice. The overall tone seems slightly darker in this set, often dealing with loss, and in one case a daringly sympathetic portrait of a pedophile (not that his actions are seen as less than monstrous, but Bennett still forces us to perceive the man as a human being trapped by forces beyond his control, rather than simply as a monster).

As in any collection of short pieces the quality of the tales is variable, but none are less than quite good, and 5 or 6 are exquisite; heartbreaking, funny, powerful.  Some of the pieces hang on a last minute twist, but more of them are really about peeling away the layers of ""ordinary"" people to show the pain and confusion under the masks we all wear.

""Telling Tales"" is series of short stories -- about 10  minutes each -- often both funny and poignant told by the writer/actor, about his growing-up in Leeds, during WWII and after.  The pieces slowly advance from his young boyhood, confused by a war that colored everything, yet also seemed far away, on through his start as a writer. Very simply done, Bennett quietly sits in a chair and speaks to the camera.  This set isn't as powerful or moving as the two ""Talking Heads' series, but still lovely and literate. Bennett is great at painting word pictures to capture of both the absurd humor and melancholy sadness of simple everyday life.

Overall, these unusual and potent experiments in storytelling represent an excellent use of the intimacy of television, where lengthy close ups and simple visuals are more effective and less fatiguing than they can be in theatrical features.

If any of this sounds at all interesting to you, I strongly recommend this set as a very worthwhile investment.  (Note: Sadly, here in the US it seems to only be available on a region two version, which means you must have a region free, or region 2 (europe) player to watch.  Hopefully someone will release a region 1 (US) version.  It's certainly more than worthy.)",1355961600,9,3883,4.75558867362146
