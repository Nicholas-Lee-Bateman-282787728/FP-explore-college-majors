3788080,1,B001T4XWK6,"I cannot stress enough, watch the first one a give this one a skip.  I you have watched the first one then you have already seen all the good parts of Teatrino.  It is like watching a one year old remake a great work.",1256688000,6,217,3.909090909090909
3788081,5,B001T4XWK6,"This series is very well done, thoughtful, contemplative, paced well, and focusing on character development.  I'm giving it 5 stars b'cos it does what it tries to do very well.

BUT, if you liked the first and are expecting more of the same, I think you might be disappointed.  The action scenes -- primarily gun battles, are short-lived and brutal.  The character designs are a bit more cutesy than before.  Many episodes have little to no action at all.  While the first series was largely a 'girls with guns' and 'fight of the week' type show, this takes a much slower pace and has a discontinuos plotline.  It is not so much about the girls or the fights, but all the other people and all the events around them.

So to summarize, this is a great series for drama and character development with a little bit of violence and psuedo-realistic gun battles added in (more 'real' than the first).  It covers a lot of ground and makes you understand where most of the characters are coming from, why they act the way they do, etc.",1254182400,3,1028,4.513513513513513
3788082,5,B001T4XWK6,"Despite being a bit disappointed when I first heard the animation would be different I was excited for a second season. I finally purchased this last week and it did not disappoint. At all. Yes the visuals are different. Not better. Not worse. Different. If you are a true fan of the series, and not just watching it for the action sequences, then it's the characters themselves that you love. Il Teatrino does an even better job than the first run at exploring the characters and their relationships with each other. I'm really picky when it comes to spoilers, and not wanting to know much of anything about a series before watching it, so I won't get into details about the who's and what's. Character development is top priority. I'm sitting here, as I'm writing this, watching it for the second time. I'm going to go ahead and close this out before I get too long-winded, but if you enjoyed the first season don't listen to what you may have heard about this being a lesser offering. Fans of Gunslinger Girl MUST own this...",1253750400,3,1028,4.592391304347826

3788084,5,B001T4XWK6,"This is a good continuation of the original series. The lower budget hurts, but the new animation studio did a good job of capturing the feel of the original series and they continued the storyline. This time around the series has a stronger story arc and the focus is more on Triella. It's not a black and white world, as evidenced by the treatment the three main ""villains"" get, both in terms of air time and character development. It's hard to find Anime that rises up to the level of both of Gunslinger Girl series. Just as with the first series, while violence is a part of the series, it's the characters and the character development that makes this such a great series.",1253059200,2,677,4.512195121951219
3788085,5,B001T4XWK6,GS2 was great. I enjoyed it as mauch as I did GS1. Great story line and all the characters were represented. GS2 focussed on Triella and it was great to see her in action.

3788087,4,B001T4XWK6,"I don't say this often, but I had the rare opportunity of going into Gunslinger Girl misinformed.  It has been often said that the show's primary attribute is shock value in the idea of brainwashed children acting as cold-blooded assassins.  Worse still is that previews, trailers, and other promotional material surrounding the property do little to dissuade this notion.  However, I am pleased to report that judging the show based on that single aspect would be doing it a great disservice.  But before I get ahead of myself, let's take a look at the cold hard facts, shall we?

Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino The Complete Series comes in at a runtime of 315 minutes and contains 13 episodes spanning two discs.  The discs come packaged in a pair of thin packs (with some very impressive label art) within a cardboard slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate TV MA (mature) rating due to some graphic violence sequences and themes of warring factions, civil unrest and of course assassinations.

Language options are typical sub and dub, which means the viewer has the choice of running either the original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) and the option of displaying English subtitles beneath either dialog choice.

Extras include an interview with the Japanese voice actor who plays Marco, original TV commercials, textless songs, and a host of upcoming Funimation anime previews.

The story follows the innocent and borderline adorable girls of the SWA (Social Welfare Agency) who, despite their kind hearts, seem a little bit eschew right from the get go.  It turns out that these girls are actually the grizzly remains of humans who by all facts and circumstances should be deceased.  Only rather than resting in peace in a cemetery somewhere, these children have been reassembled with cybernetic implants that replace the damaged areas and act as memory suppressants.

With all past knowledge of their existence wiped away, these girls are trained in the ways of combat, assassination, weapons use; in other words they are killers with loyalty to the government that built them.

Okay so my summary sounds an awful lot like the malarkey I was dealing with coming into the series but rest assured, the simplified plot synopsis does little to demonstrate the show's greatest strength: Character development.

The pacing is spot on throughout with a deliberately slow and intriguing beginning that doesn't fully answer all of the viewer's questions.  The plot structure is such that answers come swiftly just like the action and by the third or fourth episode; it feels like a masterwork of storytelling and visual delights.

Set in Italy of all places, the core of the tale centers on a political conflict between a governmental body and a terrorist faction called the FRF.  Their primary target are the members of the SWA which basically boils down to cybernetic assassins squaring off with supposed normal children with personality disorders deluxe.

The political segments, like the rest of the show, are quite well done and go a long way in setting up a believable backdrop for the action in the foreground.  Especially noteworthy is the fact that the show's creative team goes the extra mile to convey the conflict from both viewpoints so that a black & white/ right and wrong, good guy/ bad guy perspective is never a factor.

The music score is exemplary with excellent use of tension and building that coincides beautifully with the on-screen situations.

Voice work is also quite commendable with the English dub squeaking in as the overall superior choice in my opinion.  There was a time when I advocated the idea that the only way to enjoy anime was to crank up the original Japanese dialog and follow along with the subtitles but Funimation has been raising the bar so steadily that there is little reason to cling to my old ideology.  Don't get me wrong, the Japanese dialog is spectacular here but American voice actors (especially those in the employ of Funimation) have proven time and time again that they are very capable of nailing the emotion and grit of a dark story like this.  Gunslinger Girl is no exception to the trend.

Like you may have surmised, the very deepest levels of this tale strike a chord of fear within all of us as to what it actually means to be a human.  Swirled within a life of confusion, control, conditioning and killer instinct, the will to be free, the will to love and be loved still manages to resurface.  When it does, the assassins are treated medicinally so as to remain complacent but there is an element of just how much oppression the human heart can take all throughout this tale that manages to inspire.

Sure the element of gun-touting, seven-year-old-girl super killers is a bit unsettling, the true strength of this anime lies in its strong character development, expert pacing, and gritty atmosphere.  The human condition, though never quite in the foreground of the prose, acts as a constant motivator of the lead characters.  This coupled to the fact that the Italian scenery, political conflict, and voice acting are all spot on results in a show that's best not to be missed.",1252540800,13,5192,4.919724770642202
3788088,5,B001T4XWK6,"I finally finished watching GG2.  I must say it was very good.  For you who have seen the first series, the anime is different than the original but most of the main voices are the same.  The story line was good.  I haven't read the manga in a while but the show seemed to follow what I did remember.  Action and violence mixed with the emotional complications between the girls and their handlers... I found it difficult not to watch the whole series in one sitting.

The only complaint would be that only thirteen episodes are presented.  Two other episodes, 14 & 15, were not included, though they were in the Japan release.  Other than that, I would recommend buying this box set.  If you have not seen the first series, I would say buy both, but I believe Gunslinger Girl 2 can stand alone.",1252195200,7,795,4.427586206896552
3788089,5,B001T4XWK6,"Finally, it's here. Several years after the original Gunslinger Girl blew me away with its stunning visuals and shocking premise, the much-awaited sequel, Il Teatrino, or simply Gunslinger Girl 2, has arrived. Based even more closely on the manga by Yu Aida (and with even more supervision from him), this series is a direct continuation of the events from the first show. Where the first series was less about action and more about the relationships between the characters, Il Teatrino zooms the focus in squarely on the action and plot. It assumes you are already familiar with the concept of the ""fratello"" and the cyborg girls, and as such only gives a brief overview of the premise in various episodes. That's not to say that there are no more emotional moments or shocking scenes. Far from it. In fact, GSG2 is probably even MORE shocking with some of its subject matter. The show is quite deserving of its TV-MA rating; there is more blood, much stronger language, and more horrible things done to children. I won't give a plot summary here, because it's on the back of the box, and since I hate knowing even minor plot details before watching a show, I will give the same courtesy to readers of this review. I will say that this series does a fantastic job of keeping continuity with the first GSG. There are many references back to events in that show, and even some cameos by characters you thought you'd seen the last of. We finally get to see Angelica in action, learn more about Triela's heartbreaking backstory, and are even introduced to a new fratello.

 Now, about the somewhat controversial visual style... The first GSG, animated by Madhouse, had a massive budget, with somewhere around $130k devoted to each episode. Il Teatrino was less fortunate, and had a much more modest budget. While it is evident that it is not the same animation studio (Arthouse this time around) or budget level, do not let that put you off. Yes, the character designs have been changed somewhat, but the results actually end up being closer in resemblance to the original manga, so that should be a plus for all you purists out there. I personally was not put off by the visuals whatsoever. If you are willing to look past the negative things you may have heard, you will be quite pleasantly surprised, as I was. I had heard mostly doom and gloom about how awful Il Teatrino looked, but after actually watching it (what a novel concept, right?), I was quite pleased with how it turned out.

 The English dub performance is another gem from the folks at Funimation.  The entire original cast returns for the sequel, and hammers the ball right out of the park. Frankly, this show would not be the same without them. Laura Bailey onces again stands out and demonstrates her impressive range as Henrietta, and the rest of the cast picks up right where they left off in the original. Funimation gets a big round of applause for pulling the cast back together and establishing some continuity.

 All in all, this is a can't miss, must have follow up for fans of Gunslinger Girl. Do not be put off by internet rumors or bad reviews elsewhere. This series, combined with the first GSG, is a masterpiece for those who appreciate sad, dark, morally gray anime. Bottom line: buy it.",1249344000,51,3269,4.684668989547038

3788099,3,B001T4XWK6,"Going to try avoiding a repeat of what others have said.  If you loved the first season as much as I did, you may want to watch this.  But the focus has shifted from the characters of the girls and their handlers to an action-themed anti-terrorist story.  That's okay if you like it, but it's essentially a completely different show using the same characters.  Not that you might notice much, as the girls themselves are no longer central to the story.  My main complaint is the very poor quality of the animation - long still shots, poor artwork, and the cutesy-moe makeover of the characters.  It was a major distraction from what is an otherwise acceptable show.  It's certainly not horrible, but definitely not nearly as awesome as the first season.",1377734400,3,753,4.702290076335878

There was a 5 year break between the first and seconds seasons production wise, so the characters do look a little different with the new animation and everything, but its completely welcome. This set has episodes 14 through 26 and 2 OVA episodes. Strongly recommended.",1374364800,,486,4.867469879518072

3788103,5,B001T4XWK6,"I loved the first season and loved this season even more. Since Teatrino focus mostly on Triela (my favorite of the cyborgs) I enjoyed this season the most.

3788104,4,B001T4XWK6,"I find this season to be lacking compared to the first. This season the story quality really takes a hit. Visual quality is up, but the story is just not that great. Character development is more thrown in just to take up time. Wish it was better, but it is not that bad. There are worse, way worse.",1354406400,,299,4.172413793103448
3788105,3,B001T4XWK6,"I enjoyed GSG season_1, which is why I ordered this. It seems the writers had toned down the violence in response to critics who didn't like the idea of little girls trained to be assassins.  I'd speculate these critics are mostly women (maternal nature).  From a guy-mentality perspective, it's feasible to teach children to become government operatives to go after the bad guys.  I'm sure Al-Quida, Hamas, and other terrorist groups would never expect children to walk up and slit their throats; or pull a handgun with silencer to dispatch them to Allah.  GSG season_2 is 85% yadah yadah dialogue and 15% action, which is a disappointment.  Some thought provoking scenes, like the ambush on a military truck delivering weapons to the black market, only to realize one member was a long-time friend who turned traitor. Another is the female bomb and tactics specialist who wants to avenge her father, not realizing she had become a terrorist.  If GSG season_3 was axed, it's because season_2 lacked action-packed scenes that made GSG_season_1 so popular.  I'd still purchase season_3, hoping the writers had decided the critics who complained of violence in season_1 should be ignored.",1352419200,,1186,5.1139896373057
3788106,5,B001T4XWK6,"Gunslinger Girl is a great anime. I won't explain the story, but I'll tell ya what makes the series so great. The animation in this series is amazing. This is to be expected from a newer anime, but the coloration and backgrounds are very beautifully drawn. Much of the time you would think that you saw the characters superimposed onto a painting in an art gallery or something. The voice acting is also very good. The music in this series is also very beautiful. The relationships built between the characters are very well written and also pretty touching. The morality of saving a child's life but using them for a dark purpose is also explored pretty deeply.

Season 2 is a little different than the 1st. In the 1st season Henrietta was more of the main character. In season 2 the story focuses more on Triela, and her rival Pinocchio. It is more emotional at times, I think mainly b/c we saw the first season and have become more attached to the girls. This is a great series. I really enjoyed watching it. The Blu-ray quality is also really good for season 2. Season 1 didn't seem to be all that much better in HD I think. Either way I hope you enjoy it.",1350172800,,1160,4.420560747663552
3788107,5,B001T4XWK6,"The 5-year time frame between the first and second season, not to mention the different studio, has caused totally different voice actors/actresses for almost all the characters. The same issue however, is not very much applicable in the English version.

At first I have problem playing it at my computer using Cyberlink PowerDVD 9.5 (is it a good Blu-Ray player software to begin with?) and I have to resort to download so many trial version of other Blu-Ray player software, because the series in this Blu-Ray is at 29 fps (others such as trailers and 'root menu' are at 23 fps). I can only watch it smoothly after updating the Cyberlink software.

The series cover volume 3-5 of the manga (for the 13 episodes) and 2 chapters of volume 6 for the OVA, with plenty of addition/edit/removal/improvement/restructuring of scenes. Fans of action-packed scenes can enjoy the improvements on how the gunfights/CQB/ambushes are conducted, and fans of lolis can watch Henrietta in party dress and 'mizugi'.

The discrepancies of names between the Japanese and English versions are retained and kept in the ending credit, such as Guise/Jose, Franca/Flanca and most notably Hirscher/Hilshire.

Only 2 disappointments: absence of textless second opening and capturing frame in Blu-Ray is disabled, plus the unnecessary textless ending, as if the very reason of having textless opening and ending is not obvious. Oh yes, the 29 fps caused me to spend additional time to solve the problem, and after finished watching it, the soundtrack that refuses to get out of my head is out-of-stock at major online stores.

I'm treasuring this Blu-Ray as if it's my second Haibane Renmei (hontouni arigatou gozaimasu to Kou Otani for the music), and can't figure out why this Blu-Ray doesn't cost my arms and legs.",1337299200,,1792,5.081632653061225

After watching the original, I was expecting the same quality to persist to the continuation, but I was a bit disappointed. From the very first episode, the show felt really cheesy. Having said that, the longer I watched, the more the show started to grow on me, and I soon started to look past the bad acting and the second-rate animation and focus more on the story.
In conclusion, the show is good, but could have been so much better.",1327449600,2,496,4.461538461538462

3788110,2,B001T4XWK6,"2 STARS for a worth buy - just because the continuation of the original series.
I'll be fast about my review. I felt I own this review to the fans of GSL.

Il Teatrino begins strange fot the eyes of those like me that just watched Gunslinger Girl original series (or season 1, if you prefer).
The draw is different: you WILL notice the change of traces in the first seconds of Il Teatrino. It changes too much! This is my concern #1. NOT THAT I think the drawing sucks - it's beautiful indeed, but the traces CHANGED some characters, like Triela and Henrietta - the most of changed of the girls.
Personality: I grant that ONLY CLAES have absolutely the SAME personality of the original series. The Henrietta don't have all that tenderness anymore (wait). I don't remember wich is the episode, but one of the 3 firsts. Henrietta ALMOST gives me the feeling of feeling sexually attracted by Giuse. So... where's that tenderness? Angelica is a waaaaay different person. Claes is the same personality: PERFECTLY AMAZING! Rico: changed a bit - it's more feminine the character BUT looks like the same personality.
Voices: NONE is the same as far I know. All voices seemed to be changed.

*PLOT* (and finally the PLOT!)
MASSIVE! I'd low the number of episodes to 8. There's too much stuff unnecessary.
BUT the plot itself is amazing!
SPOILER about WHAT is the plot:
The plot tells basically the story of FRANCA, that blonde girl that calls to police to tell about kidnaped girl (Claes as decoy) in the mountains. Tells the story of her revenge.
The plot also tells the story of a cold-blooded assassin Pinocchio that helps Franca in the first plot.
And the MAIN plot is, like everybody will imagine because the series cover, is about TRIELA. Everything in this anime concerning Triela is Amazing. The 2 stars of my rate goes to TRIELA and CLAES.
Do you see practically a normal girl all the time - that you know it's a Cyborg. It's a show of her part - but the VOICES and the drawing that changes of the original series to this one, makes the anime lose some bright IF you watch this anime JUST AFTER the Gunslinger Girl original series.

I'm not sorry for buy Il Teatrino, I'm just a little disappointed about HOW this series is not as good as the other (original series).
If many people says ""the continuation will never be so good as the first one"", this is EXACTLY what I meant in Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino.",1315785600,3,2408,4.556581986143187
3788111,3,B001T4XWK6,"I love anime. I spend way too much time watching it. This series - it had it's moment's, but overall I did not care for any of the characters. Most were one dimensional place-holders. Many of the episodes seemed forced - violence and gun-play tossed in to keep things moving.  I really expected better plots and animation.  The idea was there - cute girls with guns (or explosives, or whatever they need) bio-enhanced to be better killers.  Each girl with a man old enough to be her father. Everyone assumes an innocent dad/daughter pair till the bullets start flying.  Underlying this is a slight sexual tension - should he be a father figure or lover? - that's never fully explored.

I don't know - it just left me with a feeling that it could have been so much more.",1313712000,,769,4.503597122302159
3788112,4,B001T4XWK6,"I have to admit, I didn't think I would end up liking Gunslinger Girl, but it was great.  After watching the 1st season (loved it), I wanted to watch the 2nd, but I started having doubts about the 2nd season, thinking it might be not so great (most anime end up like that).  But seeing how my sister has Netflix, I took advantage of that and voila, the 2nd season was there to my advantage!  Watched it and loved it just as much as I loved the first.  It doesn't continue from the first season (it comes back with a new story with new cases---every now and then, it refers back to the some parts from the 1st season, but nothing confusing), but it does bring back ALL the characters from the first season (literally, even side characters) along with a few new ones, the main new character is a young man name Pinocchio (the first and only boy assassin in Gunslinger!  Weapon of choice...knives ^__^).  In the second season, just as the cover shows, Triela is the cyborg mostly focused on this time since she runs head to head with the new assassin Pinocchio and vows to get him back (he kicked her @#&$% when they first met), whereas if you remember in the first season, it focuses a lot on Henrietta.  If you've watched the first season and felt that not ALL the characters' stories were explained, the second season goes into more details, mainly on the handlers and how they got sucked into training little girls to kill.  Anyway, I think this anime is worth watching and owning!  **If you did not watch the first season, you should not get confused if you decide to plunge into the 2nd season first.

3788113,5,B001T4XWK6,"Do the ends justify the means? Apparently, in this animation, the Italian government believes so as they secretly programming young adolescent girls to become killers. The series never glorifies what is being done to these girls, it just tries to explore the many consequences and paradox between innocence and bullets.

I especially like this season because it more closely explores the relationship between Triela and Hillshire, my favorite characters in the series. The storyline is well thought out, the drama and action scenes are good, and the character development is so well done that it could bring you to tears for the situation these girls have to go through.
This animated series went on for two seasons and I wish they continue to do more, although it doesn't seem likely. As of this writing, the original manga is only now coming to a conclusion and it looks like it's going to be a tragic one. Although it's sad and has no comedy relief I think this is one of the best dramatic animated series I've ever seen.",1302998400,,1024,4.785310734463277

Special Features: Japanese TV interview #2 of 5... (Why bother if you're not going to put them all in?).  Textless Songs.  Original TV Commercials. And, of course, Trailers: Most are done well (they actually give you enough info about the show to decide if it's worth looking into) but a couple are vague and one is for a live action movie. (I dislike this. I want anime ads in my anime).

  This is the story of cybernetically enhanced children assassins and their handlers used by the State (Italy in this story) to remove ""threats to national security"". It deals with questions of ethics and morality vs. convenience (or ""necessity"" as governments would call it). They also go a little further in this second series to add the weight of the advancements the girls cybernetic testing are providing to the medical community. The ""bad-guys"" this time are more developed adding the question of ""are they really bad?"". There is more, but I'll leave something for you to enjoy...

  This is the sequel series to Gunslinger Girl and mostly lives up to expectations. It is thought provoking and well written. This series explores the girl's relationships with their handlers and the reasons their handlers came to their jobs. It also interestingly goes into the girl's target's past and their motivations and reasons as well. Don't get the idea this is nothing but sentimental flashbacks though, there is an active ""present"" story line and plenty of action. While I still prefer the original series slightly, I'd say this is a worthy sequel to a great series.",1298246400,,1914,4.987381703470032
3788115,1,B001T4XWK6,"I'm not going to go into the plot of Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation has yet again releases another upscaled piece of garbage.

This Blu-ray set has a number of issues with the video. The most blaring of which is the fact that this release in not actually progressive as it says on the box (1080p). The coding that is used is Macroblock-Adaptive Frame/Field or MBAFF. Which in simple terms means the your video switches between being interlaced and progressive. It makes for a very choppy playback, with distinctive blocks on the screen were the video has not updated. No commercial HD product should use anything other then progressive coding.

The other issues are blurry images, the lines are fuzzy, there is a lot noise in the video, and artifacting during many scenes. The only saving point to this whole thing, is that the animation is simple so major issues are not as noticeable. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.

If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning this because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.

I added a screenshot to the images section to show how bad this release is. Make sure to look at it full size, as it naturally looks better at a smaller size. Also the screenshot was not altered in any way from the Blu-ray source.",1297900800,3,1494,4.563432835820896

3788117,5,B001T4XWK6,"If you expecting more of the same from the original you will be pleasantly surprised.  For me this is actually a better series than the original.  While Jose and Henrietta are still important characters, they are not the main characters.  Rather Triela and her handler Hilshire seem to be the featured pair.  Also, all the fratellas are developing more of a personal relationship with their handlers.  Even Jean seems to care more for his fratella (Rico) by the end of the disc (and not as a mere tool for accomplishing his goals, which are also brought out in this series).  That being said, this is still a Gunslinger Girl series.  Little children should not view this due to the sometimes warped sensibilites shown.  After all having Rico smile like the litte girl she seems to be before beating the living daylights out of a terrorist suspect is a little disturbing even to me as a fan of the series. One of the best parts of this series is the way the show makes you care about the girls even if they are deadly weapons in young girls bodies.  Oh, this series also shows a lot more of the backstory on the girls and their handlers than the original.  In one of the episodes you see where Triela came from and how it applies to the way Hilshire treats her.  This is just one of the ways that make this series more enjoyable than the original (but see both, they are great series on their own).",1294531200,,1397,4.43921568627451
3788118,4,B001T4XWK6,"The original Gunslinger Girl (in Japanese with English subtitles) was a piece of art in all respects. It was visually pleasing, the characters were alive and believable, and the story was intriguing to the point that you wanted to watch the entire series in a single setting. Season 2, Gunslinger Girl  Il Teatrino, was of equal stature in its original airing in Japanese.

My review is of the English dubbed version, however, and that leaves a great deal to be desired. I was fortunate enough to be able to watch the first six episode in the original language with English subtitles. I was unfortunate enough that when I purchased the VOD download, that it contains only the English language version. In spite of what other reviews have said about the quality of the English language voice acting, my view is quite different. I found it dry and uninteresting, and a detraction from the story that unfolds on the screen. To add insult to injury, the English cast seemed not to even be able to apply the appropriate accent when speaking character names.

The result is an experience that left me wanting. It's a shame because the story is of a superb caliber. Had this item been presented with the ability to chose audio language and subtitles, it would have received a full five stars. As it is, I can only offer four.

I've since purchased the Blu-ray of season 2 and was able to enjoy the series the way it was meant to be viewed. I will also state what some others have said regarding the art in season 2. While not bad, the big-eyed-typical-anime-style detracted from the visual appeal of the first season. I do wish they'd stayed with the original animation house.",1287100800,,1669,4.666666666666667
3788119,5,B001T4XWK6,"This blu-ray set is actually better than it seems, as it also includes the 2 ovas. I bought this set and the ovas separately on dvd, and I wasted money and feel like an idiot.",1286409600,13,175,4.0285714285714285
3788120,3,B001T4XWK6,"There are some folks here who have said that although this series is different from the original, it is still the same quality of story and almost as good as the original. I am going to disagree. The animation is very different, the girls are very different, but most importantly the story line is not as good. This is not the original, it is not as good as the original, and I can't think of a single thing that was improved in this version.

The girls have been ""glamorized"" for this series. Big eyes, cute hair, etc. Henrietta looks nothing like her character from the original series. The moment that I noticed this, I knew there was only one reason to make this change - the story is not as good as the original and they need to prop up the series by making the girls more attractive.

The animation is not of the same quality as the original. Many shortcut methods were used to reduce cost and stretch frames. This I could forgive if the story made up for it. Alas, it does not.

That said, the most important aspect of the original series was the storyline and the time spent developing the girls' characters. This critical element of the original series' success is sorely lacking in this series. The entire time I watched this series, I kept asking ""where are the girls?!"" This series spends too much time on characters I do not care about and that contribute nothing to enhance the story. Where is the action? I want more action WITH the girls. What I remember most about watching this series is constantly wondering when the girls were coming back and why are they giving me a soap opera with characters I don't care about. When they did finally get around to the formula that worked in the original series, it was always too little and I would be disappointed when they went back to the soap opera.

If you loved the original series as much as I did, you are going to be seriously disappointed with this one. If you must have it to complete your collection, or as in my case, having a serious need for more GSG, then by all means go ahead. But you will be disappointed.",1286150400,9,2081,4.411458333333333
3788121,4,B001T4XWK6,"When I watched the first season of Gunslinger Girls a few years back, I was really drawn to the story of these cybernetic enhanced little girls who are used as assassins in a fictional Italy.  The series had a somberness and humanity to it that I hadn't seen much in anime.  Although the plots usually revolved around a mission, the series strength was that it would explore relationships of young girls to themselves, the world, and the men they were partnered with.  Finding encouragement, nurturing, and direction in a difficult world were the common themes.  Unusual stuff, Gunslinger Girl.

When I saw the initial art designs for season 2 I pretty much avoided it outright.  The show had abandoned it's gothic realism in favor of a less expensive, more colorful and cartoony look.  More jarring sitting thru the first episode, which recaps the essential info of season 1, with some really uninspired art and animation, and the music had descended into a pretty generic synth heavy score.  However, as the action concluded, the story shifted to the girl's dormitory and Henrietta's discovery of a present her handler Jose has bought for her.  All of a sudden, all the strengths of the show were back.  I can't help feeling that the first episode was a test for the animators to see if they could pull off an episode with a smaller budget and a shorter schedule.  That's how I look at, and in that way, it's forgiveable, because Il Teatrino delivers the goods when it comes to narrative and emotion.

***minor spoilers***

The main story arc revolves around the FRF assassin boy Pinocchio, his relationship with Franco and Flanca (the bomb makers from season 1), his encounter with Triela, and the bombing of an important civil project in southern Italy.  The show once again makes no clear stand about the morality of any of it's characters, but does steep us in their backstories, and they're quite good.  Rather than center on Jose and Henrietta, whose relationship is fairly well established in 1, it is Triela and Hillshire who are the focus of Il Teatrino. Her origin backstory ('Flowers of Goodwill, ep 10) is very powerful, and Hillshire is no longer this stern man in a grey suit of season 1, but a an ex-cop, learning to be more compassionate to the coming of age angst of his ""sister"".  Other standout episodes include 'A Day in the Life of Claes' (ep 8), which uses the song 'Scarborough Fair' as a wonderful subtext for her feelings of loss, 'Caterina and the Circle of Revenge' is amazing drama, as Flanca recalls her motivations for becoming a terrorist, and facing some angry victims, and 'Clever Snake, Simple Pigeon' where the girls must assassinate a target at a showing of the opera 'Tosca'.. which is the spiritual center of this season, the opera's meaning and it's associations with the social politics of Italy...

Where season 1 was a slower, more deliberate pace, season 2 goes for action and high emotion, and in this reviewers opinion, succeeds on all counts. I was interested in all the characters, and couldn't wait to see what happened next.

Like others are saying, if you liked season 1, give it a chance. It's a different flavor, but it's still Gunslinger Girl.  And it's still a great dramatic niche-anime.",1279065600,4,3244,4.791741472172352
3788122,5,B001T4XWK6,"I've now watched this series repeatedly on both a higher-quality 1080p/120Hz LCD HDTV, and a lower-quality 1080i CRT HDTV.

As before, I think that the majority of this show was created in 1024 x 576 semi-HD resolution, or 576p, and upscaled to 1080i/60 for Blu-Ray by the Japanese production companies. Funimation was responsible for the encode, but not the upscale. Note that most of Funimation's other native HD Blu-Ray animes are encoded at 1080p/24, this show is an exception. 1080i was more appropriate to ensure the ending credits scrolled smoothly.

This Blu-Ray collection contains both the 13 episode Il Teatrino TV series, as well as the 2 Il Teatrino OVA episodes at the end, making it a great buy. I recommend the Blu-Ray version over the DVD version for this series, it is both cheaper and has better audio and video quality.

There are video quality issues which apply only to the first OVA episode and first TV episode. The first OVA episode is 576p but slightly blurrier than the other episodes. On my 1080p LCD HDTV the difference is nearly unnoticeable but on my lower-quality HDTV the blurriness stands out, making this the worst looking episode. The first TV episode is either upscaled 480p SD, or horribly upscaled 576p which blurred out the image tremendously. This was then followed by artificial sharpening leading to ""edge enhancement"" artifacts which some have complained about. Only this episode has the edge enhancement. On my 1080p LCD HDTV this episode looks the worst by far, but on my lower-quality HDTV this processing trick works and makes this episode look as good as the rest.

The only disappointment with this release is that some of the Extras are missing on the Blu-Ray version, which supposedly exist on the DVD version. Most notably, the second creditless introduction is missing. This is very sad because it's the only Extra that has worth. The Japanese Blu-Rays probably have it, though.

Now for a brief review of the show itself. Please note these are only my personal opinions.

Directing: 4 out of 5 stars. I think this show has no real single director. Several people including the creator of the original manga worked together as the ""director"" for this show. The result is that there are some aspects of the directing that I do not like, such as the annoying flashes to white, or the slow letterboxing effect for flashbacks. But overall the show is well-paced, well-focused, keeps your attention, and is not corny, which indicate an overall good job in this area.

Drawings: 5 out of 5 stars. Terrific drawing style. It's not the same style as the manga but neither was the first Gunslinger Girl anime series. The drawings in Il Teatrino look far better than the drawings in the first anime series, which scare me.

Animation: 3 out of 5 stars. It's not as cheap or poorly-animated as many have said. The first episode has some pretty cheap animation but it gets better after that. Compared to the original series, the budget is lower and the frames are skimpier, but the quality of what frames and movement there are, seems better than the original series.

Music: 5 out of 5 stars. Much better than the music from the original series, which was actually silent most of the time. Ko Otani did the music for this show, Funimation mistranslated his name so I did not realize until I had finished watching the whole series. I would not have expected his style of music to fit with this type of show, but it fits perfectly.",1276128000,17,3472,4.792642140468227
3788123,4,B001T4XWK6,Love the bluray format. The anime was a little unguided and should have focused more on the Triela character but I suppose that it is more important to follow the manga.,1275523200,,169,4.483870967741935

3788125,4,B001T4XWK6,"Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino is a terrific anime and it looks great on Blu-ray. I would recommend it. It may not be quite as good as the original series (the studio took a budget cut, there's a new director, and the animation is nowhere near as crisp and amazing as in the first season) but it is still worth watching and has some compelling characters and awesome action. The emotional development in the narrative is not as strong either and the psychological depth is not up to the par set by the first season; instead the second series focuses on the action more or less with the terrorist plot taking place. All in all, more superficial and action oriented with less cutting edge visuals as compared to the first season, but as I stated above still worth a look if you are a fan of the series and a worthy blu-ray entry in your collection. Certainly a four-star anime...
EDIT: Let me be clear in that this anime is not yet available in Region-1 (US) as a Blu-ray but I have seen the imported Blu-ray and it looks stellar. I have no reason to believe that Funi will not do a quality job on the Region 1 version. When the US version is available I will view it and update this review...",1263859200,17,1189,4.36036036036036
3788126,5,B001T4XWK6,"The follow up to the first season of Gunslinger Girl is another stand-alone hit. While the first season provided solid background for Henrietta, this season focuses on both Triela and the new character ""Pinocchio"". It also features more action and suspense then the first season. Although there is a follow up OVA which looks amazing, it is not a necessary buy. Like the first season, Il Teatrino provides you with a solid, satisfactory, ending. If you bought and enjoyed Gunslinger Girl, this is a must buy, as is the OVA. However, this is more of the same. If you dislike the idea of cyborg children running around Italy with guns attacking terrorists- then this is not the series for you. It should also be noted that the animation is amazing, and has good voices for the English dub.
