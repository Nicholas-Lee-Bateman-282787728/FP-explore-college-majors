It is pathetic. What irritates me is, Filmation knows how to do a decent job with animation, when they  did the Gilligan's Island it was a representation of the series, with similar story lines, including many of the cast members doing voice over. The dog characters are fine as is the setting. They should have  standardized the military dress, like the show and wrote a decent script, used  the characters personalities. The MASH actors might have  done the voice over. The writing, images of characters, and personalities  I'm guessing none of them wanted any association at ALL. It has been said more then once, Copying of some ones work it the sincerest form of flattery. The closest thing they got right was Major side burns and  yet they dressed him like a Mountie!!!!. I can see why ABC cut this after 2 seasons. Don't waste your money.",1459641600,,993,4.6022727272727275

8376050,5,B000MPPFW6,"I remember this was one of several cartoons shown as part of the Groovie Goolies and Friends Cartoon show. Others included ""Fraidy Cat"" about a nerotic cat afraid to lose the last of his nine lives. Another was of a Caveman and his Pet Packaderm ""Wacky and Packy"".  I think there were a couple others. But the situations and voice charaterizations were pretty funny!  Sure some of the spoofs were dated and depicted Classic TV shows of the time,  but all the other elements made these cartoons funny! Other shows included ""Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down"", ""My Favorite Martians"" and ""The New Adventures of Gilligan"". There may have been others too. And they also need to release ""The Archies Cartoon Funnies"" and the ""Original Batman cartoon"".",1310083200,2,754,4.829457364341085
