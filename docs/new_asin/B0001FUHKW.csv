8011976,5,B0001FUHKW,I watch this one over and over again.  There are so many different styles of mucic and dancing on this one.  Aishwarya Rai is one of the most graceful dancers.  Her beauty is just as captivating.  Not to mention all the hairstyles and jewelry.  Great fun and always loved when I invite others to watch with me.,1198454400,,310,4.368421052631579

8011978,1,B0001FUHKW,"It's not often I write a review anywhere, but I feel the need to share my thoughts on this DVD.

I'm a new fan of the stunningly beautiful Aishwarya Rai, and picked up several of the DVDs she's featured in, including this collection of Aishwara's Top 25. I've been able to directly compare the picture and sound quality of this collection to the songs on the original DVD film releases, and quite honestly, there IS no fair comparison. The picture and sound of the songs/videos in this collection are mediocre at best when compared to the original DVDs, and usually noticeably worse.

Save your money for the actual full length DVD movies instead of this poor quality collection. Someone, somewhere (Eros International?) should be ashamed of themselves for the poor quality of this DVD collection, as not only is it an injustice to the consumer, but an injustice to Aishwarya Rai as well. She certainly deserves to be seen and heard in the best quality picture and sound possible!",1146787200,26,980,4.792899408284024
