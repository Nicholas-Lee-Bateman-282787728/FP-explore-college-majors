8481457,4,B005OK0YX4,"I saw this on Crunchyroll a few years ago and I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD ever since.  It's about a murderous sorcerer who wants to get his hands on a magic staff that is held by a young girl, whose best friend from the future uses magic (really a kind of powerful computer code that, when used properly, is very like magic)to go back and save her.  The best friend, Kiyomi, is clumsy and scared, but brave enough to try anyway.

The writing behind this story is more complex and interesting than most of the newer anime these days.  The computer-code-as-magic idea is one fascinating example.  The character designs are gorgeous, and at only 12 episodes, there's not that much filler, thankfully.  The theme songs are very cute and catchy, and there is some fanservice.  Oh, and if I remember correctly, some of the episodes are shown out of order, to make things seem more mysterious.",1319155200,15,902,4.565217391304348
