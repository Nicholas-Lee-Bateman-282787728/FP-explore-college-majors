8463933,4,B005BCE72Y,"I was fooled by the mysterious description ""...when the two decide to start a new life, and a home together, secrets of the past emerge..."" into thinking this was a psychological thriller. My mind conjured up with all sorts of possible `secrets' including murder, mistaken identities, amnesia and even a revenge plot where the leading character discovers the person she is out to get is the man she has fallen in love with. Naturally, I was disappointed (and felt quite sheepish) that the secret turned out to surround mental illness.

I've seen too many films that use `nothing is as it seems' as a plot device, and they usually end up unearthing a disturbing (yet highly clichd secret). What makes the use of `mental illness' in this this film so effective is the fact that it's something we can all relate to as humans. Perhaps we won't experience the disease first-hand but ultimately when you're in a relationship and your partner suffers from the illness, you will. There is something sad about watching someone healthy lead a stagnant unfulfilling life just as there is something sad about watching an ill person on borrowed time squeeze the most out of every single breath. The type of film is told gracefully and eloquently and speaks about the manner in which we like to look ahead into the future yet tremble in uncertainty when that future is vague or threatened. Two people who embody these stances meet somewhere in the middle and for a little while things are very good. This film teaches us there is a value to learning to let go, and that it is the ultimate expression of love.

Bottom line: This film gets 4 stars because Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were not the actors. Just kidding, please don't remake this film with Hollywood talent - it would just be a distraction. If you enjoy a slower paced film that asks not what it can do for you (thrill you, shock you, entertain you), but what you can do for it (liken your aims & purpose in life, reflect on how much you are giving vs. receiving, take up Feng Shui), then this is the film for you.",1336953600,13,2069,4.6043360433604335
8463934,4,B005BCE72Y,"This low budget indie tells the story of a young man's love for a woman
stricken with bi-polar disorder.

In a small, quiet, character based film like this performances are
everything, and director Barbieri gets two very strong ones from Nathan
Wetherington and Stef Willen.

There is something very personal about the way the story is told, and
it manages to avoid the two obvious traps - becoming soapy or becoming
clinical. Armed with a penetrating eye for framing, and a willingness
to really watch what's happening on the actors' faces between the lines
in almost a Bergmanesque way, there is a real intimacy in the film, as
well as a haunting sense of loss. One of the better, more honest and
more effecting films about mental illness and its effects I've seen.",1330041600,5,767,4.7593984962406015
