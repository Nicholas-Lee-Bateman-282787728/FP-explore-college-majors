The first focuses on Julie Clarke -Playboy Playmate of the Month March 1991. Once you get past the coming attractions the video starts right in on Julie. Julie starts off stripping down to hers sneakers and then she talks what she likes, how she was and only child and wished she has a big brother or sister, what she wants to be in life and how it all began; not all at the same time. The four segments that she is nude; she is nude 95% of the time. In the Horse Riding, Roller Bladeing and Trampoline, the clothes stay on. So in her twenty-four minutes Julie is nude half the time. Part two focuses on Stacy Arthur-Playboy Playmate of the Month, January 1991. Stacy is very out spoken when is comes to censorship and nudity. We see very little of that in her brief ten minutes. We do find out the Stacy was married at the time she became a Playmate. All together Julie and Stacy left me wanting more. Video Centerfold: Julie Clarke gets a C.",1245801600,,1083,4.393034825870647

Many of the early Playboy videos had great quality and lots of great-looking girls! Just FYI, Julie has her own website now at [...]. She looks as good as she ever did!",1160611200,,305,3.935483870967742
