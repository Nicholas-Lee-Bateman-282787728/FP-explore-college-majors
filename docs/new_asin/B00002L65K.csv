8196046,5,B00002L65K,"Helmut Lotti sings like no other....growing up on Elvis Presley music and style, he exudes the fervor and lovely tones of Elvis yet has a wonderful  range and style of his own... this album, or any other of Helmut is worth  hearing !  For those of us who still love Elvis, Helmut Lotti can fill  that nostalgic gap a bit, just with higher vocal range and broader genre of  music !  : )",969321600,7,385,4.205479452054795
