7839961,4,6303179991,"A film by Andy Garcia. Israel ""Cachao"" Lopez was born in Havana  Cuba in 1918 into a family of musicians and composers, which now counts  over 40 bass players. Cachao, a child prodigy, made his debut with the  Havana Philharmonic at age 12, playing bass while standing on a wooden box.  In the 1930s he joined the renowned danzon orchestra Antonio Arcao y Sus  Maravillas. He wrote in collaboration with his brother, Orestes, also a  member, over 3,000 danzones, producing at times a staggering 25  compositions a week. In 1939 while experimenting with the syncopation of  the Cuban danzon, he and Orestes created a danzon titled ""Mambo,""  which led to the foundation of the mambo craze that swept the world. Later,  in the 50s, he again revolutionized Cuban and Afro-Cuban music when he  gathered the most accomplished musicians of Havana's cabarets and dance  halls to record his now legendary Cuban jam sessions known as  ""descargas"" - fusing the free form improvisations of American  jazz to Afro-Cuban rhythms. In the summer of 1992 a concert was held in  Miami to honor this living legend. This movie and subsequent recording  ""Cachao Master Sessions, Vol. 1"" are inspired by and dedicated to  him - ""El Maestro"" Cachao. 1 hour and 52 minutes. Color. Dolby  Stereo.
