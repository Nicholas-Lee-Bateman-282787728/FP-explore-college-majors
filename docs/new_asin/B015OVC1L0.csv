8734209,4,B015OVC1L0,"This is a very enjoyable documentary by Jason O'Brien, dealing with the phenomenon known as ""Cuddle Parties"", which
seems to be catching on around the country. People get together, sometimes in groups, at times with a 'cuddle therapist' in
one-on-one sessions, and just lie down and cuddle. There is nothing sexual about it, just a way of releasing tensions, and
interacting with people who just need affection. There are scenes filmed at gathering, and private sessions, with participants
being interviewed and discussing their feelings Well filmed and edited by Mr. O'Brien.",1456963200,3,576,5.34065934065934
