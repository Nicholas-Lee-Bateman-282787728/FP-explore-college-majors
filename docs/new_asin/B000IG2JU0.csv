This videotape contains three episodes from three television series that were popular in the 1950s. The quality of the stories varies, the newer ones are better. A show with independent episodes doesn't seem as good as shows with recurring characters that provide a background of continuity.

From ""The Twilight Zone"" there is ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" taken from an Ambrose Bierce story. [Was Bierce a Civil War veteran?] The Union Army captured a spy and punished him by a field court martial. His past life flashes before his eyes until he drops into the stream below. The water is deep, he escapes the gunfire and is carried downstream. He runs into the woods to escape to his home and wife. Is this too good to be true?
[Note the wide tire tracks on the ground, and the ""crooked shoes"" on the man. Before the 1870s many wore the traditional symmetrical shoes and boots that allowed rotation to equalize wear (like cowboy boots). This nearly silent film was filmed in France.]

From ""One Step Beyond"" there is ""The Sorcerer"", a story about a German officer in World War I who confesses to a murder. He is given a month's vacation. We see how this story begins. A man must sign a paper to allow the army to run a telephone line on his farmland. People there believe this man is a sorcerer who can foretell the future. What is happening back home in Berlin? Wilhelm finds out. Was it a dream? Or madness? ""I don't know."" Will there be some event they can believe in?

From ""Lights Out"" there is ""Grey Reminder"" taken from an Edith Wharton story ""Pomegranate Seed"". Mr. Kenneth Ashby's first wife died in an unusual way; she was a very possessive woman. He receives mysterious  unstamped letters. Who brings them? Lawyer Ashby explains this to his wife Charlotte. She is never to open that old desk! Charlotte blames Dorothy their maid for these letters. These letters came from Elsie, Kenneth's first wife! Charlotte has a plan to stop those letters. Then the door bell rings and they answer it. [This 1951 show was in the early days of TV.]",1317859200,,2086,4.657608695652174
