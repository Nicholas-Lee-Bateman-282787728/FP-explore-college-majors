8130059,4,B000GALHPG,"I got this DVD because I knew that Turner has set up tons of projects in the past couple years.  He sells like 5 scripts a year.  It takes me a year to write one script, so I wanted to know how this guy is so productive.  He talks a lot about his writing habits, which I found inspiring.  I didn't always agree with the writer's opinions, but you can see how his confidence must help him sell all his ideas.",1163376000,,407,3.9876543209876543
