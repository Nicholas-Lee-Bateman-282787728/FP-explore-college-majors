8574663,5,B00BW7CW10,"When the pilot of Lewis first aired in 2006 I doubt whether many would have predicted that it would be as successful as Inspector Morse, from which it was originally a spin off. However, seven years on it has certainly achieved the heights reached by that series and has arguably surpassed them. A new series of Lewis has been an annual, and much anticipated treat. The episodes have intelligent, well thought out plots which the feature length format gives sufficient time to develop, the acting is superb and the relationship between Lewis and Hathaway is certainly the equal of that between Morse and Lewis.

The character of DS James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox has developed during this time, so that he is now as strong and central to the series as Lewis himself. It is interesting that again there are parallels with Morse where Lewis himself grew in stature as that series developed. It is incredible to think that the character of Lewis was introduced in Morse as long ago as 1987 so it is no wonder we have grown used to him in the intervening 25 years particularly as the part has been acted by Kevin Whately throughout that time.

The other star of the show is, of course Oxford, where the historic buildings provide the backdrop although with the death count rising so alarmingly it is getting quite a dangerous place to live in!  This is currently the definitive box set containing all 24 episodes released to date in North America. However, purchasers should be aware that another series which comprises four more episodes has been shown in the UK and will be released as Season 6 in North America, presumably sometime soon (edit - in June).  It does look as though that will be the final Lewis series.  If that is indeed the case it will be a considerable loss as there is little in the way of current TV productions which are anywhere near as good as Lewis.

This particular set would appear to be the box set of Seasons 1-4 which was released in 2011 plus the North American release of Season 5 in a separate box. These are the versions which were edited from the full UK copy for the North American market.",1364947200,3,2130,4.592105263157895
8574664,5,B00BW7CW10,"After the death of Morse (and, sadly, of actor John Thaw) it was a brilliant idea from ITV to keep the series going centred on Morse's faithful sergeant, Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately). They employed a whole new team of writers, but Morse's creator, Colin Dexter, still participated as advisor. Now promoted to Inspector and having lost his wife to a hit-and-run driver, Lewis has enough personal angst to act as a foil for the `thriller' parts of the story. He also now has a sergeant of his own, Hathaway, ably played by Laurence Fox. The setting as for Morse is Oxford. Hathaway's priestly training is again a good dramatic foil to Robbie's worldliness.  Rebecca Front appears as Lewis' boss, Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent; and the potential love interest stems from Lewis' relationship with pathologist Dr Laura Robson (Clare Holman).

Inspired no doubt by the continuing presence of Colin Dexter in cameo roles (similar to Hitchcock), there are all the intelligent clues we have come to expect that used to confront Morse. In the pilot episode, there are also a couple of nostalgic reminiscences of Morse to provide another thread of continuity, and there are references to Morse from time to time in other stories. In the first series we have three 90 min stories in addition to the pilot episode, and there are four stories in each of the six series. The excellent standard of the Morse series in plots, drama and acting continues. Highly recommended.

After Series 1 finished I was hoping there would be more episodes made and I was not disappointed. The second series opens with an episode I found quite enchanting: `And the moonbeams kiss the sea' - a line taken from a poem of Shelley's, `Love's philosophy'. From poetry, the next story turns to music, `Music to die for'. The remaining 90 min episodes are `Life born of fire' and `The great and the good'.

These are surely some of the best thrillers on TV - to my mind, the very best, despite stiff competition from Taggart and Dalziel & Pascoe. The stories are good, the actors well cast, and the plots quite ingenious. I defy anyone to guess `whodunnit' before all is revealed. As the British newspaper, the Daily Mail, said of the first series: `this is . . . superior quality detective drama'. There are four episodes in each series.",1364860800,,2303,4.793450881612091
