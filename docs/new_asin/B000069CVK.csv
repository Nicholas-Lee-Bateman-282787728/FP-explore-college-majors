3535342,4,B000069CVK,"I bought this DVD the first day it came out and I'm definitely glad to say that I got my money's worth. The main portion of the Morning View Sessions is Incubus' great and special performance in some New York studio. One thing I noticed is that most of the crowd didn't look like Incubus fans, and most of them weren't really getting into the groove, they might have been like a paid audience or something, but I don't know a lot about the details of that concert, I may be mistaken. Anyway, like I said the concert is great (could've been better if they played more songs of Morning View, and some backstage footage) then you got a bunch of features/footage of the Incubus dudes activities in they're Malibu home while they were recording Morning View. Then you've got the making of the original video for Wish You Were Here, that was really cool cause a lot of the video was filmed in my hometown o' Pasadena. Then you've got the original Wish You Were video. I would have definitely have given this DVD 5 stars but there were a few things that bothered me: the menu layout doesn't look as good as the one on the previous DVD, and you can't immediately jump to the menu by pressing the menu button on your remote (it takes a long ... time), could've used more backstage footage, more songs off Morning View, ... But other than that I definitely recommend this DVD to all Incubus fans or to people who like music/band/concert DVD's cause this is very entertaining.",1022630400,5,1465,4.470149253731344
3535343,5,B000069CVK,"This dvd is awesome, if u love morning view and any or all of the other incubus titles then this is a must see.  You can't miss out on this dvd. It has great footage of the band playing a live show with a crazy circular phycadelic set that you will probaly never see at one of their concerts.  It is an absolute chill dvd and can be watched over and over.  This dvd also had other cool features with things that show off the bands house, and on this dvd you actully get to see a lot of Killmore and her his opinions on a lot of things.  The footage of the band is great and you get to see behind the scenes stuff such as Dirk jamming on a gutiar, Killmore losing money to Jose in a pool match, and Killmore doing a crazy chin thing.  If you love inbcubus get this freaking DVD, it freaking RULES.",1022630400,4,796,3.981132075471698
3535344,5,B000069CVK,"This DVD is all around great. Not only does it have the concert footage from the New York show last year, but it also has a lot of behind the scenes stuff from their house on Morning View.  A lot of funny stuff with the guys...very entertaining.  I think it was better than When Incubus Attacks: Vol. 2, but that one was great too.  I would suggest to any Incubus fans who bought he other DVD, to get this one for sure.",1022630400,,419,4.085365853658536
3535345,5,B000069CVK,"If you're an Incubus fan this is a must have for your collection of great Incubus music and videos.  Full 90 minute concert filmed the day the 'Morning View' CD was relased.  The band is setup in a circle just like their sessions at Morning View Dr.  They perform songs from S.C.I.E.N.C.E, Make Yourself and Morning View albums.  Ammazing how they can reproduce all those thick huge sounds and dynamics live.  Lots of extras on this DVD.  Tons of 2 mins clips of stuff filmed by the band - some of it is really funny!  Also includes the original video of ""Wish You Were Here"" as well as the making of.
Make sure you buy this DVD as well as their other one called ""When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2""

This very dvd is the same show i saw that rocked and amazed me. Another reason would be that it's INCUBUS. One of the greatest and unbelivable bands. Even if you have never heard of them (which most people certainly have...think of that song 'Drive'...""Whatever tomorrow brings i'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea~)you would love this dvd if you are into alternative and rock.... *Here's some advice~ buy it now and start making out to it tonite dudes and dudettes*",1022284800,,612,4.513513513513513

3535348,5,B000069CVK,"I loved the Morning View Sessions DVD.  I have only seen Incubus live at large outdoor concerts and enjoyed the feeling of being close up.  The crowd in the DVD is very small and never gets too crazy, but I wasn't watching this for the crowd experience.  I wanted to experience the band and the music in a way that most people never get to in real life.  The sound quality is excellent and I have even used this DVD for something to have on when friends come over.  Many commented that they would be purchasing a copy for themselves.  It was everything I hoped it would be and I'm just wondering what took me so long to purchase this.",1363219200,,634,4.241666666666666

Aw heck. I was going to give it 4 stars, but I have to give it 5. Besides, watching them record in that house is really freaking cool.",1357603200,,392,3.9

Anyway this dvd is amazing, it has a live show of them in New York, its a small intimate show which is better in my opinion. And i am obsessed with the extras.. behind the scenes, wish you were here music video, the guys just being themselves in their home studio.

3535361,5,B000069CVK,"This performance is really something special, and was surely a very memorable experience for the audience.

The venue is small, cozy, and intimate.  The band members face each other, arrayed roughly in a circle, so that they can really communicate and synergize.  The audience surrounds the band on nearly all sides, as though it's hugging the band.  And the ambience has a soothing aura, with simple warm lighting and a scattering of lava lamps and assorted other homey trinkets.

Most importantly, the band flawlessly delivers awesome music, which ranges across the full spectrum from rock which will blow your hair back to ballads which are tender and beautiful.  And to top it off, the sound quality of this DVD is superb.  In fact, I'll even dare to suggest that the band's performance and the sound quality of the DVD may surpass their corresponding album versions.

Simply put, this DVD captures a truly magical and transcendent moment, and is not to be missed by Incubus fans, especially the Incubus of this vintage (2002).",1243123200,,1031,4.953488372093023
3535362,5,B000069CVK,"This is an absolutely amazing concert dvd.  I am a long time incubus fan and i love it.

3535366,5,B000069CVK,"The Morning View Sessions is a recording of the concert held for an extremely fortunate select few, in an extremely small and intimate venue in New York on the day the album, Morning View, was released.

What I would have given to have been there...

The concert showcases the band's strength as a cohesive art machine. While everyone with an album out there these days refers to themselves as an artist, I feel that a likewise select few are worthy of the title. Incubus is one of these few.

The impressive aspect of the live Incubus experience is how the band manages to recreate a studio sound using a DJ, a lone guitar, a lone bass, a lone voaclist and a set of drums. Other bands fail dismally trying to extrapolate the studio performance into a live experience; Incubus manage effortlessly. Retrospectively, one appreciates the deftness of the musicians' less-is-more approach to songwriting. And it must be said, guitarist Michael Einziger is horribly underrated out there - the man is a god.

The concert itself is a good mix of old and new tracks -  a good couple of the new songs appear in the show, as well as old favourites like Pardon Me and The Warmth. The performance is a little understated - one wonders at first if it might be an MTv Unplugged show, given the atmosphere, and you do sense that the band may be a little hemmed-in, surrounded on all sides by the audience while they perform on a tiny stage in the middle of the whole thing. Having seen other live Incubus shows, I know they can really belt it out in an arena, and do it well; nevertheless, it is always good to see the versatility that such an intimate setting provides.

In addition to the concert - too short, in my opinion; a mere 12 tracks is hardly a taste of Incubus' vast capabilities - the disc features the video for the lead single Wish you were Here, as well as the making of the video, which is really cool. Also included is a behind-the-scenes of the concert, which is a nice addition.

It is a superb complement to the already-unbeatable album, Morning View, and a must-have for all fans.",1123200000,,2086,4.517241379310345
3535367,1,B000069CVK,"Although a lot of people said it is good, this DVD may not attract other people. What I am looking for is a beautiful song. But the title and the cover of this DVD is much more beautiful than the concert. I think I bought the wrong DVD.

I couldn't conclude the music is not good. It is just not my style. It may be amazing for many Incubus fans.

To me, I just feel the DVD is very noisy. When you place the order, please check on the web about the Incubus and make sure you understand you are going to buy.

Enjoy it.",1121472000,2,519,3.9238095238095236
3535368,4,B000069CVK,"This DVD is great! It has bonus features, music videos and more. I think if you are wanting to experience Incubus in another level then this is one of the DVD's of their's that you MUST own. It shows concert footage from NYC and their overall performance is amazing. Well done!!!",1121212800,,279,4.490196078431373
3535369,5,B000069CVK,"Folks, simply amazing (Ground breaking & breath taking).  Out of every DVD I own, I have watched this one, too many times to even count.

Now before I end this review, I want to stress how awesome this DVD is!  I will probably buy 2 Or 3 more (As back ups).  It's simply that awesome.  If your an Incubus fan (Or Not), & you don't already own this, please stop reading this review & buy this, I will promise you that you will not be disapointed!  Beautiful work Incubus (Kudos to those who see through sickness!).  I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal!  It's better than watching Geller bending silver spoons better than witnessing newborn Nebulas in bloom she who sees from up high smiles and surely sings prospective pries her once weighty eyes and it gives you wings!  Enjoy this DVD folks!

Great party DVD or while playing pool!  This DVD is like nothing I've seen before (After listening/watching this a million times, I went out and bought the Audio CD to have in the car.)  DVD great (or unbelievable) and so is the audio CD!  Everyone should own these!",1110672000,26,2365,4.580487804878048
3535370,5,B000069CVK,"To celebrate their fourth studio album, 2001's ""Morning View,"" Incubus performed this initimate, twelve song concert in front of a small crowd of fans and thus, ""The Morning View Sessions"" is born. The concert itself is incentive enough to buy the DVD. The band goes through twelve of their best songs, mostly material coming from the aformentioned ""Morning View"" and their break-through ""Make Yourself,"" but as a little treat, the band also busts out two unexpected songs from the ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."" album (""New Skin"" and ""Glass""). The overall atmosphere of the concert is peaceful, as the crowd mostly stays quiet while the band performs for them. Every now and then Brandon will make a comment to the crowd, but overall, crowd participation is low, which actually isn't a bad thing, as we can really hear the band shine. The band, in top form (with original bassist Dirk Lance in tow), rip through the set so flawlessly and make it look so easy. The song selection is great, and the way they alter a few songs (albeit, very minor alterations) helps keep it more entertaining. In addition to the concert, this DVD surprisingly has a lot of bonus footage. For starters, we get the original cut of the ""Wish You Were Here"" video, which was banned by MTV after September 11th (amazing how ridiculous the censorship got, the video isn't bad at all), along with a making-of piece for the video. But the big treat is the behind the scenes footage of the making of ""Morning View."" You have to look around a bit in the menu to find all of it, but the footage is very entertaining and often informative, as we follow the band around in the beautiful house they stayed in to record the album. Overall, it's an excellent release from Incubus, who really haven't put out a bad thing yet. The concert is great, and the supplemental stuff just makes it all that much better. If you are an Incubus fan, I recommend this, along with their two other DVD's.",1106438400,9,1939,4.6725146198830405
3535371,5,B000069CVK,"This, as you may have already read, was a very intimate little show made to promote Morning View. The live footage is as good as it gets, and the sound is flawless to boot. This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there's that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous.

A few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You. As amazing and funny as the special features are, the standout is really the performance. I can't find any words that would do this show justice. I guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself.",1101081600,4,1452,4.204301075268817

The crowd has been minimalized. Whoever directed this did a fantastic job, you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song. Incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there (Glass, sounds great). This is the best concert DVD out right now",1099699200,2,463,4.043478260869565
3535373,5,B000069CVK,"Brandon Boyd & Co. really shine on ""The Morning View Sessions"". Don't let the name of this DVD fool you... it's not a ""making of the album"" feature. This is an actual 12-song set at a very small venue. The intimate setting is much more pleasing to the camera eye - as you feel you're practically on stage as Brandon sings, Mike Enziger plays guitar, and the rest of Incubus plays along effortlessly. Incubus makes it look so incredibly easy - these kids are California professionals in my book - masters at their craft. Picture quality is superb, camera angles are great and they change at just the right pace (those who have recently seen Kiss's Melbourne Symphony DVD know what I'm talking about in regards to the acute headaches and nausea encountered due to the high frame rate change every 2 seconds). This DVD features 12 songs - taken from their 3 previous releases (prior to 2002), ""Morning View"", ""Make Yourself"" and ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E."". There are two acoustic songs featuring Brandon & Mike on stage along (performing the songs ""Mexico"" and ""Drive"") that are simply wonderful. There is some additional footage of some of the behind-the-scenes recording of ""The Morning View"" album from a Malibu mansion, as well as the video ""Wish You Were Here"" (and the making-of the video). This is a great way to kill an hour or so. If you like/love Incubus, you need this DVD (5 stars).",1088553600,3,1381,4.734439834024896

Technically the sound and video quality is great, the interactive menu is fun, the subtitles for the concert reveal the lyrics! I love to watch this DVD because it's like having Incubus playing for you and a few friends in an very intimate and mellow setting. It may not satisfy more hard core fans but it's a wonderful addition to an Incubus collection and a great introduction for those who don't know Incubus' work and/or assume that they don't like them.",1065225600,,627,4.709090909090909
3535375,5,B000069CVK,"This DVD is awesome!  I couldn't have asked for anything more.  It is nothing but the performance of songs in a little dark room.  I think Brandon Boyd is absolutely yummy and I was pleased they sang old songs along with some new ones.  I love watching this DVD when I am stressed out and need to chill, not that all of their music is low key by any means but the stuff they sing about is real and they all are so passionate about what they do and I think that is partly why they are so successful.  I love Incubus and am always worried when I buy a DVD from a band but this didn't let me down at all.  It is wonderful, even if you just like Incubus you need to Buy This because it will simply set you free!!

The concert is brilliant and they play a really good selection of music.  The songs consist of some off their albums Make Yourself, S.C.I.E.N.C.E and of course Morning View.  If you like Incubus and you have a DVD player I stongly recomend this DVD to you.  The concert is a small gig in New York.  Its not really a typical Incubus concert as the crowd just sit there and the band contain themselves more than usual.  I have never been to an Incubus concert as I live in New Zealand and Incubus have never been to NZ but the day they come here I will go to their concert without a doubt. Anyway back on to the subject of the DVD they play all their best songs and it is the most brilliant DVD you will ever own - BUY IT.",1044230400,2,887,4.122093023255814
3535377,5,B000069CVK,"I recently saw Incubus in concert in Champaign, IL.  It was the single greatest show I have ever seen.  The band was full of energy, the crowd was noisy, and the set was big and beautiful.  That being said, The Morning View Sessions DVD is NOT a typical Incubus live concert.  If you saw them live and you want to buy this DVD to see Brandon jump around, crazy crowds, and lights flashing, this concert is not for you.  The Morning View Sessions focuses strictly on the music.  The set is small and comfortable, the band is subdued and focused on playing, and the crowd is very small and very quiet.  The environment is almost completely opposite a typical Incubus concert.
After the band finished up ""The Warmth"" and jumped right into acoustic versions of ""Mexico"" and an amazing performance of ""Drive"" in which the remaining 3/5 of the band joins in midway through, you're going to start to realize that Incubus is not the hardcore band they once were.  Some people get peeved by this fact.  Personally, I don't know what the complaints are all about.  Their music is getting better and better as they mature.  Morning View Sessions showcases the leaps the band has made since 1997.
One complaint I have is there aren't enough songs in the show.  ""Certain Shade of Green"" was left out and ""New Skin""  was played instead, and ""Privilege"" was nowhere to be seen.  Other than that, there's really nothing to complain about here.  The music is awesome, there are lots of special features, and finally, THE MUSIC ROCKS.  I know i mentioned that, but oh well.  If you're a fan of Incubus for their music as much as their concert environment, buy this DVD.  You owe it to yourself.",1041897600,15,1676,4.585858585858586
3535378,5,B000069CVK,"Incubus is a great live band. and this is the DVD to prove it if you like the live performance on ""When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2""then you'll love this. Why because this is simply the best live performance by incubus yet. Hearing the raw energy in ""Pardon Me"" or the beauty of a acoustic ""Drive"" will have one wanting more. This is overall better then ""WIA.2"" The only downfall is theres not as much stuff. But the stuff that is on there is good enough for a incubus fan. The standout tracks on this album are ""Pardon Me"",""Stellar"" ""Warning"" ""Drive"" & ""Wish You were here"" the best song is ""Pardon Me"".

3535379,5,B000069CVK,"While i liked best the first DVD (When Incubus Attacks Vol. II), the Morning View Sessions left me fully satisfied. It doesnt content as much stuff as the first one, but still... It features a great concert live in New York, the video of Wish You Were Here and the Making Of this video. But the most interesting parts are the exclusive footage of the Morning View Mansion shot by the band members themselves. This is, of course, a must for every Incubus fan, really cool!",1039737600,,471,4.488372093023256
3535380,5,B000069CVK,"This DVD is the greatest thing i have ever watched before in my life! I really think everyone should go out and buy one right now. Yes, it's that great! If you love incubus, then you will love this DVD!",1034726400,,202,4.075
3535381,5,B000069CVK,"What better way to promote your new album than to release a DVD of your band performing the songs.  The MorningView Sessions DVD is Incubus at their best.  Eventhough the concert is relatively short (12 songs), incubus does an incredible job performing songs off of MorningView, as well as the favorites off of Make Yourself, and SCIENCE.  If you like the acoustic guitar, then you will enjoy the two song acoustic set performed in the middle of the show(Mexico, followed by Drive).  However, if you are into the fast paced, alternative style, The MorningView Sessions does not disappoint.
In my opinion, the two best songs on the DVD are Circles,an energetic, fast paced song, which is performed to perfection.  The next best song performed was Glass, which is a more hardcore alternative song off of SCIENCE.  However, don't take my word for it.  Everybody likes something different.  That is why this DVD performance is perfect for any Incubus fan.",1031356800,3,951,4.937106918238993
3535382,5,B000069CVK,"This is a wonderful DVD.  I do have to say that ""When Incubus Attacks Volume 2"" was better, but not a hell of a lot more.  Both DVDs are worth the money if you are a true Incubus fan.  Some of the home video stuff is sooooo funny.  I recommend buying this, but if you only have enough money for one DVD, buy ""When Incubus Attacks Volume 2""",1027900800,,339,3.9411764705882355
3535383,5,B000069CVK,"If you are a true incubus fan what are you waiting for!!! Get up and go buy this dvd!!!!!!!! I suggest this to all incubus fans out there. A great performance with a great mixture of songs off of there 3 last albums....Science,Make Yourself, and Morning View..... Get this now!!!!!!!!!!!! Its a Must have!!!!!!!!And if you haven't seen them live i suggest you do....I just saw them on the Civic tour in San Antonio and It was the best concert iv been to so far!",1026691200,,461,4.435294117647059

LISTEN CLOSELY ALL MUSIC EXECS
This is the Incubus formula for producing a great concert DVD.
1.) Rent a soundstage
2.) Limit the audience and make them keep quiet
3.) Keep the vibe mellow so the focus is on the music, not an outlandish performance.
4.) Surround sound!
5.) Digital picture!
6.) Include making-of home videos for the last album.
7.) Include a music video (and making-of documentary)
What else could you ask for?  I have about 10 music DVDs, and they do not compare to the quality of this one.  I watch it over and over.",1025568000,,663,4.546218487394958
3535385,5,B000069CVK,"In the area of overall quality, this dvd is much better than ""When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2""  The footage is much better, the performance is the best recorded live performance that I've ever seen, and all of the extras are a nice touch to the dvd.  The performance takes place on a really neat round stage in front of a very small audience, the band is set up as if it were a jam session in a studio, and they play like they don't have to convince anyone of anything.  They play alot of their songs from all of their cds except from ""Fungus Amungus.""  Such songs as Pardon Me, Stellar, New Skin, Mexico, The Warmth, Nice To Know You, and about six or seven other songs are included on the dvd.  The dvd also has footage of the band's house on Morning View in California.  Then as an added bonus the original ""Wish You Were Here"" video is included on the dvd as well as the making of the video too.  There isn't as much footage or as many music videos on this dvd as there were on ""When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2,"" but this dvd is put together so much better, and has a lot cleaner look to it.  I recommend this dvd to anybody who is interested in seeing what the band is really like, and this dvd is definately a must buy for any die hard incubus fan out there.",1023235200,26,1256,4.118852459016393

8294368,5,B000069CVK,"I might be a little biased because Incubus is one of my favorite bands, but being as objective as I can be, I think this is one of the best live music DVDs ever made.

We've all probably seen live DVDs from some of our favorite bands and been less than impressed by the quality of the performance, but Incubus really nails it with this session. Brandon Boyd really hits the notes and puts feeling into the performance, as well as the rest of the band.

If you're an Incubus fan, you won't regret this purchase.",1395705600,,510,4.302083333333333
