6819426,2,B00PNQN6Z2,"Earthquake is usually funnier than this and he usually perfoms a tight set. This time around I felt like I was watching a new comic performing his first stand-up routine, instead of being the veteran I know he is.",1430524800,,213,4.487179487179487

6819430,5,B00PNQN6Z2,"I can see why he titled this.  This stand-up routine was based a lot on what was going on in the world today, and his look on Michael Jackson's funeral.  THIS DUDE NAILED IT!!!  He was funny and, if you really took a good look, he was very truthful about his views.  Funny and hilarious, I totally enjoyed this DVD and hope that I can cop more from him in the future.",1427068800,3,367,4.055555555555555
