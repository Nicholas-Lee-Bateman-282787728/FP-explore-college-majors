6495427,2,B00LOCL804,Last Supper wasted my time.  I was expecting more actions.  Just look at the cover!  I was going to write more but the more I think about the movie and more pissed off I get.  Two stars.,1433635200,,186,3.945945945945946

6495431,5,B00LOCL804,"This Chinese movie is much better than the 47 Ronin. The story of the movie is trying to introduce the history (or just a story)  of the wars among 3 nations in the past. This story true or not does not matter, but the designs of the actors' dresses are beautiful and true to history. In my opinion, the color of this movie is first rated. It is a good buy.",1427241600,3,357,4.028169014084507

8667247,5,B00LOCL804,"Just had to write a review after reading some of the brain-dead ones on this page.  No, this is not some cheap, stupid chop-socky flick.  In fact, the only time any ""Kung Fu"" is used is in a scene where some villagers  briefly get the drop on some soldiers, but are quickly subdued by the armed and armored troops as, in reality, Shaolin martial arts are a myth, most kung fu styles were civil boxing styles used by peasants and we don't really know what martial arts were used by Chinese soldiers as they died out from lack of use with the advent of firearms

No, this is a serious drama, well acted, beautifully filmed and interestingly directed; Jackie Chan fans need not apply. Told from different points of view, it did become a little confusing to me at one point.  Also, a westerner might find him or herself a little aloof to the goings ons due to subject matter, but when the movie wraps itself up at the end, I found it unexpectedly emotional.  Better directed than scripted, the movie ends greater than the sum of its parts.  Recommended for lovers of good foreign films and realistic historical movies.",1482537600,2,1114,4.54
8667248,3,B00LOCL804,"A story about the historical ""Feast at Hong Gate"" at the time of the rise of the Han Dynasty. The story is told in flashbacks by and elderly Liu Bang, first emperor of Han. It can be a bit confusing, but still an interesting story",1480636800,,230,4.133333333333334
8667249,2,B00LOCL804,Not at all what I expected.  Watched it only to see if it would get any better.  Would not recommend,1464652800,,100,3.95

8667255,4,B00LOCL804,"More of a mystery film than just a martial arts film.  Lots of plot twists, and surprises.  A very good movie.",1436140800,,110,4.190476190476191
