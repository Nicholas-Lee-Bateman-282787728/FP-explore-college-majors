7960538,1,B0000648YQ,"Before Wesley Snipes became BLADE (1998) there was...Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson as Jack Cutter? Yes, that's right, everyone's favorite low-budget martial artist action star (who could never act a lick, but was likable anyway) breaks his usual mold and stars in a lame cheapie horror film Executive Produced by an uncredited Roger Corman. This film is so bad, it ignores every vampire convention since Bram Stoker wrote ""Dracula"" and is full of so many holes, moths are envious. It also doesn't help that nearly all the vampires and other characters are named after famous horror directors and personalities (such as ""Argento"", ""Sangster"", ""Ulmer"", ""Baker"", and many more), which is really a turn-off and pure laziness to boot. The film begins in March 1968, where young Jack Cutter (Christopher Aguilar) is told by vampire hunter father Tom (a cameo by James Lew; CAGE II - 1994) to hide in the secret room in the house while he and his vampire hunting mother Mary (Dena Rea Hayess) fight a horde of vampires after being betrayed by long-time friend Sid (Sid Sham), who tells Tom he was offered immortality by head vampire Bruno Fischer (a disinterested-looking Nicholas Guest; THE LONG RIDERS - 1980; who literally sleepwalks through his role and speaks in low-volume monotone) by telling Tom, ""Drink an ounce of blood a year, you'll live forever, man!"" Young Jack leaves his hiding place when his father and mother are circled by a family of vampires and a martial arts fight break out. Jack sees his mother killed and his father hands Jack a book containing the names of every vampire family alive and a double-barrel shotgun, throwing young Jack out a window and telling him to ""Trust no one"" before Tom is killed (off-screen). Jack hides outside while he watches Bruno enter the house. One of the vampires tells him that the boy got away and Jack looks down at the book and we are transported to June 1995, where adult Jack (Wilson) is about to enter a club where the vampire family that killed his mother and father are celebrating a reunion. He uses the shotgun and a pair of handguns to shoot the vampires and then snaps their necks with his martial arts prowess to kill them (Don't think too hard about this because it will drive you crazy). Jack makes a mistake when a female photographer who works for the club accidentally takes his photo, so when toothpick-chewing Detective Hopper (Marcus Aurelius) and county coroner Roy Ward (Michael Cavanaugh; THE HAUNTING - 1999) look at the carnage at the club, the photographer gives Det. Hopper the photo of Jack, which is distributed to every precinct in the city. Jack is at a warehouse he calls home and crosses out the names of the vampires he just killed in the book his father gave him. By the look of the names crossed-out in the book, Jack has been a very busy boy since 1968. Jack is spotted by the police when he is walking down an alley and a chase ensues, only for Jack to be hit by a car driven by Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith; THE BABY DOLL MURDERS - 1993; and, yes, her character's name is atrocious), a reporter for a National Enquirer-like rag who was sent to Los Angeles to cover the spate of snapped-neck murders (How's that for coincidence?). Jack hops into Raimy's car and tells her to drive, but she is seriously wounded by a cop's bullet and crashes the car. When the police get to the car, both Raimy and Jack are gone. Jack has brought her back to his warehouse, where he pours a healing liquid on her bullet wound and it disappears. Jack tries to explain to Raimy that vampires are real, but she doesn't believe him (What about her miraculous recovery from being shot? Doesn't that lend Jack some credence?). Raimy soon changes her tune when female vampire Tournier (Maria Ford; FUTURE FEAR - 1997; doing a lousy French accent) invades the warehouse and tries to kill Jack (Somehow, Jack manages to get off three shots from a two-barrel shotgun!), but she leaves when she is hit by some pistol fire (This is really getting ridiculous, especially when we just heard Jack tell Raimy that vampires are fast healers). Meanwhile, Sid (who hasn't aged a day since 1968) tells Bruno that Jack just killed a family of vampires, so Bruno gathers his ""family"" together (one of them is portrayed by Vincent Klyn, who played the head bad guy in director Albert Pyun's CYBORG [1989]) to come up with a plan to kill Jack (Just for funsies, Bruno invades a house and makes a meal out of two young boys, again off-screen). Raimy gets Detective Ron Browning (Cash Casey) to believe that vampires are real (after Browning makes the mistake of trying to handcuff Jack) and the three of them try to take down Bruno and his family. I don't think I have to tell you how it turns out. If there is one word I could use to describe this film, it would be: Lazy. Screenwriter William C. Martell (CYBER ZONE - 1995) ignores all traditional vampire tropes and even lets them walk in the sunlight, as long as they wear sunglasses to protect their sensitive eyes! And why does Jack even bother to use a shotgun and handguns when he knows that vampires heal quickly and bullets won't kill them (And yet Sid dies of shotgun wounds in the finale)? I think it is just because they could spend their special effects money on bloody bullet squibs and not worry about vampires that are hundreds of years old turning into dust or bursting into flames when Jack snaps their necks. They just remain human-looking. And why does a solar eclipse play an important part in the finale when we have already seen all the vampires walk in the sunlight? Like I said, lazy. Director Rick Jacobson, who directed Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson in BLOODFIST VI: GROUND ZERO (1994) and BLOODFIST VIII: HARD WAY OUT (1996), as well as directing FULL CONTACT (1992; which I think is his best film), THE UNBORN II (1994), BITCH SLAP (2009) and episodes of the late Starz series SPARTACUS (2010 - 2013), seems to be off his game here, as he lets too many mistakes into the film and allows the cameraman to vibrate the camera like he has some type of palsy every time there is a major action sequence (Art Camacho, who has a small role in this film, was the Martial Arts Choreographer). This sloppy mess of a film is best avoided and should only be viewed on how NOT to make a vampire movie. Thank god for Wesley Snipes. This is only available on VHS and DVD in fullscreen by New Concorde Home Video (The trailer on the DVD contains scenes not seen in the final edit of the film). This is one film I will never be watching again, even if it is eventually released in it original aspect ratio. Also known as BLOOD HUNTER. Also starring Ronald Winston Yuan (as a vampire who tells Jack he is so old, he invented martial arts!), Vince Murdocco, David 'Shark' Fralick, Sofia Crawford and Randy Crowder.

7960540,3,B0000648YQ,"The film opens in 1968 as young Jack hides from vampires who only hunt at night. He lives in an odd cabin with his parents, one where the door swings OUT. The door has chain locks on it, the ones you put on a door so you can open it and peek out and see who is then when the door swings INWARD. The cabin has no glass windows. The window frames are covered with easy break away boards, but the vampires need a plan to get inside. Seriously.

27 years later, the vampires can hunt during the day....seems they always could. When Jack (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) attacks a vampire, Spanish guitar music suddenly appears while the camera shakes. The most frightening thing in this film is Maria Ford's varying French accent. It starts out heavy and funny and goes to non-existent. Jack also encounters the only cops in LA that don't shoot a fleeing suspect, even when they have orders to shoot on sight. The one officer chasing Jack was about 15-20 feet behind him when he runs into an automobile. Jack has time to shake himself off, get in the car and have a conversation with the driver before the officer shows up.

I liked the fact they made the dead blood sucking vampire an investment banker. Nice Touch.

Other things to look for: bullets bouncing off plastic seat covers, three shots fired from a double barreled shotgun (eat your heart out Wesley Snipes), dead guy's moving eyes, police wait to fire at Cutter until he has a hostage.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity even with Maria Ford in it.  3 stars for MST value",1410134400,,1530,4.45

Night Hunter starring Don The Dragon Wilson as Jack Cutter, this is a great movie, it's about a young man who's family are vampire hunters,
they keep a journal with a list of all the vamps each time they kill one they cross it's name off the list. When Jack was a child his mother
father and himself were in a house with the windows boarded up, a friend a fellow hunter comes banging on the door one night begging for help
they let him in, once let in he quickly betrays them and invites the vampires in, ( Jack ) who was hidden by his father before the vamps got
there watches as his mother dies fighting them, his father gets him out through the window with a gun and the vamp journal then is killed by
the vampires

he grows up pretty much a loner carrying on the family tradition of hunting and killing vampires, after killing some of them in a restaurant
he winds up on the run. The police spot him in an alley and give chase, on the run he meets a female reporter when he jumps in her car and at
gun point tells her to drive, she does and from there they start to form a bond, this film in true Don The Dragon Wilson fashion has action
from start to finish...color sound and picture quality are excellent",1304640000,,1224,4.160337552742616
7960542,1,B0000648YQ,"Believe it or not, ""Night Hunter"" is not a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/0780624890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>&nbsp;knock-off. Sure, the back of the DVD case bears the unattributed quote 'better than Blade', but seeing as this film was made a couple of years before the Wesley Snipes blockbuster, I think it's in the safe zone. If anything, ""Blade"" borrows some ideas from this one...but rest assured, ""Blade"" is about a hundred times better than this, which ranks among the worst films that Don Wilson has ever appeared in.

The story: John Cutter (Wilson) is the last of an ancient lineage of vampire hunters. Armed with a shotgun and his martial arts skills, he stalks the creatures responsible for killing his parents. Upon killing some of them in an LA restaurant, Cutter is hunted not only by vengeful vamps but also the LAPD, who believe him to be a criminal psychopath.

There are a few uncommon facts about vampires that the film asks us to swallow: 1) they can only be killed by breaking their spine, 2) their blood acts as a fountain of youth for their human servants, and 3) they can in fact walk around in sunlight, as long as they wear sunglasses. That last tidbit tells you a lot about the movie: the film is called ""Night Hunter"" but only about 10 of its 86 minutes of length take place in the dark. A plot point of the film involves Cutter needing to take out the remaining vampires prior to a solar eclipse, but it's never explained why; they can walk around in daylight just fine, after all.

Choreographed by genre guru/Don Wilson-leech Art Camacho, the fight scenes feature legitimate talent such as Ron Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Tiger/dp/6304018975/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Tiger</a>), Vince Murdocco (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fire/dp/B000094FE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fire</a>), Sophia Crawford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Seals-2/dp/B00005RDRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Seals 2</a>), and James Lew (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balance-of-Power/dp/6304371128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balance of Power</a>), but are shot and edited in typical quick-cut, B-movie fashion that keeps them from ever looking cool. The cameramen for these scenes bring the ""shaky camera"" effect to new lows. Oh, and there's a gunfight directly plagiarized from a John Woo film...if John Woo were filming on a $15 budget and drunk.

The supernatural abilities of the vampires are fudged (e.g. their supposed superhuman speed is demonstrated by showing them running in circles followed by shots of Wilson shooting at them and missing), as is most of the acting. Wilson is his usual monotone self, looking consistently angry about something (most likely one-time actor Cash Casey's atrocious performance as the detective out to get him). The vampires are led by Nicholas Guest (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer-4-The-Aggressor/dp/B0001BPSAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor</a>) and Maria Ford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Key-to-Sex/dp/B00005RYM9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Key to Sex</a>), both who should never have been allowed out of acting school. The only decent performer of the bunch is Melanie Smith (""As the World Turns"") as Cutter's kidnapee/reporter-girlfriend, but she too is at odds with the written-over-lunch script.

Is there anything good about the movie? Well, Don Wilson's wardrobe was nice: a trenchcoat and vest over a fishnet shirt is cool as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the film is fit to line a litter box with for the mere fact that even though Don Wilson had worked with director Rick Jacobsen five times before, the two are still incapable of cranking out a decent movie together. I mean, forget the film's individual flaws - after five tries of bad action flicks, you'd think they would've either gotten a cinematic divorce or finally achieved something halfway decent, but that is not the case.",1250553600,,4236,6.112605042016806
7960543,3,B0000648YQ,"Jack Cutter (Don Wilson), is the son of a vampire hunter. When his parents are killed, Jack inherits a book which lists the remaining vampire bloodlines. Jack must kill the remaining  vampires before before they get a chance to reproduce.  Sound like your typical vampire plot? Yep, but, okay I actually LIKED Night Hunter. I expected it to be just another cheesy martial arts flick, but instead, there was actually a fairly decent plot line. Don Wilson was good as the flawed, and lonely Jack Cutter. The vampires themselves were good-looking bunch (not the skinny white nosferatu type), with actual motivation (a desire to breed), and  some fairly decent acting on all parts.  I was rather pleased by the cast selection. Usually in less expensive films, the vampires are ugly to make the hero look good!
Towards the end, this flick petered out a bit, and became one endless fight scene, which had me knocking off a star. There was also a few thinly veiled S&M catfight scene between the main heroine and the lesbian vampire which seemed to be added to tittilate the audience. YAWN. (Must this happen to the heroine in EVERY vampire movie?) Still, this was a worthy vampire flick, worth viewing. (Although I could wish for a little bit more exploration into the lives of the vampires and the vampire King's love for the French woman).
Worth seeing, for some decent character development early on and a cast of good-looking vampires. Ultimately disappointing because of its uninspired ending.",1059523200,5,1492,4.908730158730159
