5571959,5,B00BC0JJDQ,"For years western film enthusiasts have been searching for a decent copy of the 1958 Wide Wide World presentation of ""The Western"" hosted by the ever popular Dave Garroway.  Well, it's here folks!  To say the least it's not digital quality, however it is the best that I have seen.  The show is from Gene Autry's Melody Ranch.  In addition to Gene Autry there are many other stars of the era including John Wayne, Walter Brennan, Gary Cooper, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, Gail Davis, Chill Wills, Bronco Billy Anderson, James Garner, Jack Kelly, Ward Bond, Clayton Moore, Jay Silverheels and more, including many real cowboys.  Also, John Ford, Frank Gruber, Jack L. Warner and Rod Redwing.  A great piece of Americana of a bygone era in the movies.  The title of this DVD is The Lone Ranger, Lost Episodes and Rare Footage.  This portion includes rare footage from the 1938 serial starring Lee Powell in the first live action appearance of the Lone Ranger with Chief Thundercloud as Tonto.  Also, the first Ranger cartoon, theatrical trailers, original commercials, an unaired episode starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels and more.  Everything said, this is quite an extravaganza!",1368748800,42,1180,5.005128205128205
5571960,5,B00BC0JJDQ,Hi oh sliver the Lone Ranger DVD was good but what was the best was the extra which showed the stunt men and women it also  Has WARD BOND JOHN WAYNE and JOHN FORD! The exta was better than the shows from the Lone Ranger tv series.,1366848000,7,230,3.893617021276596
5571961,4,B00BC0JJDQ,"This a little gem, a disc showing an episode of Lone Ranger, The Abe Speech, a quick look at a thirties LR serial, with Spanish subtitles, but the master was found in a Mexican theater don't let it spoil the fun. A quick jerky cartoon, Then commercials from the time of the series. All in all a compact look at the fifties marketing of LR. including Dodge Cars and the Peace Patrol, to sell stamps and bonds.
One of the specials is from WIDE WORLD, looking at the Western, with Wayne, Cooper,Autry, et al, passing on some snippets of Western film making. John Ford is there too, explaining how a horse fall is done, enter Chuck Roberson, Ward Bond James Garner Jack Kelly are also in there. This 'special' is very easy to watch, bit jittery, but that doesnt detract from the whole. Coop, and his co-star in Hanging Tree run through a scene, the director? explains some location tidbits and then we have Rod Redwing showing his prowess with a 45 and rifle, Jay Silverheels turns up to explain how the Indian was viewed in moves too.
I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD there are also movie trailers.
So settle down, grab your toy .45 and get ready to be transported back to those happier, simpler safer Cowboy Days we wish were still here",1365379200,35,1231,4.5

5571967,5,B00BC0JJDQ,"I love old TV shows, and this one is no exception. On the disc you get two full episodes of The Lone Ranger (starring Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels), one of which I've seen before. Unknown to me was the first serial made down in Mexico. No, this DOESN'T star Clayton & Jay. Little known commercials are included. The extras are especially interesting. They take place on Gene Autry's Melody Ranch. Of course you get Gene, but what's interesting is you see a lot of western stars of that period, including but not limited to James Arness, James Garner, Duke Wayne, Walter Brennon, and more. You also learn some of the ""tricks"" of the trade. How do they get horses to fall? And more. Very interesting stuff.",1475971200,,707,4.574803149606299

5571971,4,B00BC0JJDQ,"It's always a pleasure to finally be able to obtain long-buried archival film elements that would otherwise be left to rot in the can for decades. That being said, THE LONE RANGER serial from 1938 is dreadful. I've never been able to watch it through without falling asleep. The acting and script are atrocious and the quality of the prints is poor. This is no surprise because they just don't have the resources in Mexico to preserve film elements. This turned up by accident years ago. I do know that the final episode was heavily edited. In the Spanish subtitles, TONTO becomes PONTO.. Ouch..",1456790400,,595,4.730769230769231

5571973,2,B00BC0JJDQ,"I'm very reluctant to buy anything from Legend, but thought I'd try this and got screwed again as expected.  The section on the Lone Ranger was actually mostly good except for the serial clips which were not framed very well.  And because these have been released on VHS and Good Times DVD before, I didn't need it for that.  As far as Wide Wide World(it looked very good for a Kinescope), that is a 5-star program ruined, as usual, by Legend.  To start, they superimposed a notice over the beginning of the program that it had been restructured.  What exactly do they mean by this?  Restructured means ""to alter"".  They don't say.  Worst of all, you have to suffer through the entire program with their damn logo in the lower right corner.  And not so much as one review even mentioned the logo until now!",1453420800,2,806,4.503448275862069

5571986,5,B00BC0JJDQ,I love the old lone ranger shows. This had some things on it I had never seen such as an original animated short. When they visited the Autry western set I enjoyed it but was sorry Clayton didn't play a more important part of it. It was probably because he would have had to come out of character and I don't think Clayton did that often. If you are a Ranger fan you will probably like this.,1426204800,,391,4.090909090909091

5571996,5,B00BC0JJDQ,"The Lone Ranger rides again in this fabulous DVD that provides a retrospective on the masked man and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto. The disk features some rare footage of advertisements, rare highlights from the movie serial starring Lee Powell and Chief Thundercloud, to television episodes starring Clayton Moore and Jay Sliverheels, and various commercials they did during and after the show was on the air. The bonus feature is equally entertaining. It's an hour documentary on the western as it was protrayed in both TV and movies. There are rare interviews with both Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, and even a Lone Ranger cartoon from the 1930s. If you're a fan of the Lone Ranger, this is an exceptional buy.

5572003,5,B00BC0JJDQ,"HE'S THE LONE RANGER. what an era for this movie. both are excellent in everyway. these movies are what the MASK MAN is all about. He was a sincere man who fought for JUSTICE. He did not try to be funny or make fun of TONTO. they RESPECTED each other very much. The movies of these two men were lousy in everyway. some were just plain and simply BAD ACTORS. or THE STORY WAS BAD. It seems that in HOLLYWOOD the Hero's  must be FUNNY, SARCASTIC. OR  MAKE FUN OF EVERYONE. guardians of the GALAXSY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. but for them it works. It will not work for a LEGENDARY HERO LIKE TONTO & THE LONE RANGER. Why because we grew up with them. the told us to be good boys & girls & good PEOPLE. That's why you never saw him enter a SALOON, DRINK, OR SMOKE, These were great example of being a good person. .And  we have THE LONE RANGER & TONTO to thank for this.

5572021,4,B00BC0JJDQ,the first animated appearance of the lone ranger was a little odd with no real plot.  i enjoyed the two episodes with the sponsor's original commercial was interesting.  i enjoyed watching the lone ranger's peace patrol treasury promotion especially after first learning about the peace patrol from Lassie.  the lone ranger serial highlights is just the highlights for you will not learn the plot of the serial from it.,1395014400,2,419,5.043478260869565

5572025,5,B00BC0JJDQ,"As a kid, I tried to never miss an episode of The Lone Ranger.  Along with Roy Rogers and other heroes of that time period, the episodes were not only fun to watch, but they taught lessons as well.  I recently bought a DVD that had 28 episodes of the series and my husband and I watched all of them and were amazed at how many seemed new to us -- even though we watch the show on one of the local digital channels whenever we can.  Those 30-minute episodes packed more inside than most of the 60-minute shows of today.  This DVD gave more of the background -- starting with the first serial version of the Lone Ranger and moving forward.  The extras were wonderful - seeing Jay Silverheels talk about his time on the series was special and it was awesome to see the series from its first inception.  Also included were clips from John Wayne, John Ford talking about horse falls, and much more.
Clayton Moore will be the ""only"" Lone Ranger for me - despite recent remakes.  I remember meeting Mr. Moore at a county fair one year.  It was just a very memorable moment in my life.
If you enjoy watching old Western series -- or just old TV programs -- I would recommend this DVD.  It provides some insights into the making of the series -- and Westerns in general.  Loved every minute of this one!",1387411200,12,1294,4.309917355371901

5572027,5,B00BC0JJDQ,"Out of the Old West there rose a man who challenged the lawlessness, his face masked, his true identity unknown, accompied by an always faithful indian companion, he thundered across the frontier, appearing out of nowhere, to strike down injustice, his sign a silver bullet, his name was The Lone Ranger.

So started this dvd of the Lost Episodes, which include the 1938 movie serial, rare footage, cartoon serial, promos, commercials, a story about a bad guy Phil Beach, who had become a good guy, or has he? There is also a sigment that the United States Treasury presented with Clayton Moore's help, called ""The Lone Ranger Peace Patrol"", in schools to promote peace for all children of America who wished to join the ""United States Saving Stamps Programme"".

In the extras we get to see ""Wide, Wide, World - The Western"" which was taken from the only existing 16mm print that was presented June 8, 1958 from Gene Autry's Melody Ranch, with stars such as: Gene Autry, Gabby Hayes, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Chill Wills, Walter Brennan, Clayton Moore, Jay Silverheels, Gail Davis, James Garner, Jack Kelly and many, many more.
