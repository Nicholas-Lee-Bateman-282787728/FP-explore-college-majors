8187920,3,B000NB8HM4,"This ""Playboy Exposed: Naked on the Fourth of July"" DVD is pretty decent. It shows 7 ladies posing in various places and then taking part in a ""Miss Nude Independence"" striptease contest at a Deja Vu club. Most of the contestants are fine looking but a couple are just so-so. It's a treat to have sexy Alexis Taylor (pictured on the front cover) host the program, since I've enjoyed seeing her in several similar DVDs, including other ""Playboy Exposed"" ones as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NUDE-FOOTBALL-BASKETBALL/dp/B00002CGG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NUDE:FOOTBALL/BASKETBALL</a>&nbsp;She's often topless or fully nude while hosting, so that's great. The camerawork, editing, and picture quality are generally good.

The first 15 or so minutes shows the ladies on a farm, where they pose in various ways, spray each other with water, ride horseback topless, and so on, and often they're topless or totally nude. Then for about 5 minutes they're shown posing for photographers, with more full nudity than on the farm. About the last half hour is the striptease contest at the club, where they each strip down to their birthday suits.

The whole program runs just 52 minutes, so that's a bit short. Why did they not show more of the strip contest, since it just runs about 30 minutes? And about 5 minutes of that is wasted by a guy talking on stage. The striptease contest is decent, although as I noted a couple of the women are not great looking. The winner is dynamite, and it's fun to see her erect a huge inflatable penis on stage and then ride it, to the delight of the audience.

So, all this is pretty decent, though nothing special. It's worth getting if you can get a good price on it.",1386201600,,1752,5.055363321799308
8187921,1,B000NB8HM4,Don't buy this movie. While it says released in 2002 it is actually an old video from the early 90s. There is nothing to see... and I mean nothing. Save your money. I felt stupid for watching this ... video. If someone offers it for free don't take it. It's that bad. The only thing I can use it for is target practice. I wouldn't give my worst enemy this video.,1052179200,,362,4.112676056338028
