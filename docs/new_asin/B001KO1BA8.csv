8315584,4,B001KO1BA8,"[THE INVETERATE BACHELOR aka GLI ZITELLONI - B+W -1958- Directed by Giorgio Bianchi - Fullscreen presentation - In Italian with English subtitles]  A solid Italian comedy that's not marred by ridiculous physical sight gags but relies more on comedic dialogue and improbable flashback scenarios for its barbed and caustic humor, which got it banned in the late 50's by prudish censors no doubt influenced by the Papacy for its disrespectful presentation of marriage life and the shackles that accompany 'tying the knot'. Not to say it doesn't have its share of silly moments, but there's enough palpable humor (especially for its time) to keep things respectably amusing and humorous 50 years after its release.

Walter Chiari stars as Marcello, a salesclerk in a small town who's gradually falling in love with his landlady's daughter, and this is no accident, as both mother and daughter scheme to keep his belly full and his eyes at all times glued on the daughter's tightly-fitted fashions as she struts provocatively before him. His friend, the notorious town bachelor, known as the ""Professor"", expertly portrayed by the legendary Vittorio De Sica, philosophically advises him that men are not meant to be married, and he should avoid this pratfall at all costs. But Marcello gets shackled anyway, and his new married life turns out to be a hellish nightmare of diabolical proportions. When he can no longer endure the strains his wife and her mother (Le Streghe - the witches) curse him with, he goes mad and is arrested for murder. The remainder of the film is portrayed in courtroom flashbacks as told by the opposing accusers, in a tribute to 'Roshomon' style story-telling, and the sly prosecutors have their own sidebar sub-story and schemes in play, leading to more vitriolic behavior and absurdity. An enjoyable romp, primarily due to the genteel sophistication of De Sica, who is a joy to behold, and who has a few skeletons (literally) in various closets as the film closes out, making the ride that much more entertaining.

What's truly shocking is that MYA Communications actually delivers a superior print with coherent subtitles, dramatically unlike the bulk of their releases - if you read my reviews, I've trashed about two dozen of their films for taking advantage of their core audience by unleashing unbearably awful prints at Criterion prices, but this is not one of them. For fans of 50's or 60's Italian comedies or even neo-realistic offerings, this film is certainly worth checking out, especially if you haven't succumbed to the 'ball and chain' as of yet...",1322870400,3,2588,5.042056074766355
