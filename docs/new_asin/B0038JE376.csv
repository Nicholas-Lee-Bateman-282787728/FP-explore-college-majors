It gives you that what if feeling and makes you reconsider that ""what if"" feeling also! The Three main characters were SUPERB!!!!! They couldn't have picked a better cast. Meryl, I truly love your work and nobody could've brought this movie to light like you did!!! Should be #1 in the box office!",1261699200,6,404,4.5479452054794525

Watched it on a trip as i had nothing else to watch in a cabin - stay away from this movie if you value your time is really boring predictable and flat and the sex scenes between the two aging actors did not make it any better and the jokes were not funny at all - it was all kind of forced overall as the script really did not make much sense and when it finally ended I was like ""what did I just watch"".",1520380800,,480,3.762376237623762

Cinematography, scenery so lovely; though some of it was filmed in New York. Found all the actors just great in this; Meryl and Alex for sure but whoever the daughter's fiance (husband?) was, can't remember his name, I may have seen him here first and he really made an impression as an actor (have seen him since briefly on tv and in another/other movies).

Still don't know his real name but that's okay. I'd say it's a good comfort movie for those days when you're in under a blanket, it's raining/snowing/fall, and you're drinking something warm.

4084741,4,B0038JE376,"I liked the film, but found it difficult to watch for personal reasons. Over all I'd recommend it to those who like their rom-com with a little more complexity and substance. Anyone who has been in a narcissistic relationship should probably avoid this if triggers are still a problem for them. All actors did a superb job and I found the story to be engaging. Others have noted the son-in-law-to-be's scene stealing and I completely agree he was a pleasure to watch. Meryl Streep's Jane is perhaps a bit wishy washy and easily flattered, but given her vulnerabilities I suppose it's understandable. In the end I found the character to be likeable and human. All of them were, really, though I did have a bit of a tough time identifying with Baldwin's narcissistic and eternally ""youthful"" Jake. He played the part perfectly, though. Martin's Adam was sensitive, balanced, fun, and radiated decency, as with many of the characters he plays. Despite his penchant for playing decent people I never tire of seeing him do it. The world needs more decent people. He was a bright spot in the film for me.",1494806400,2,1098,4.7539267015706805

If you like Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin.. they won't let you down!  This is a must see movie.

Meryl Streep's character, Jane, is such a likeable person that even when she misbehaves, you still like her.  Alec Baldwin's Jake, is more complicated.  It would be easy to dispise him for immorality, but it's obvious he's got issues.  I can't say more without giving away the plot. It's nice to see Steve Martin play a straight role so well, though, of course, he still has his comedic moments.  John Krasinski is a gem!  My favorite scenes are those he's in. I'd watch the movie again just for him, even though he's only a supporting character.  Oh, and watch out for Pedro!",1451347200,,689,4.3700787401574805

4085078,5,B0038JE376,"Its Complicated is a film that stars Meryl Streep as a Santa Barbara,California woman named Jane Adler who owns a thriving bakery business and has a strong relationship with her three children. She seems to be doing fine in her life but her emotional world is turned upside down when her former husband Jake Adler (Alec Baldwin) lets her know that he really never quite got over her.  Complicating matters, is that Jake Adler is actually now married to Agness Adler (Lake Bell)who also has her own successful business  (I think it was a successful marketing business)and one child .  One of the other problems with this scenario is that Agness is trying desperately to have more children with Jake Adler unaware of what is going on. You then have architect Adam Schaffer (Steve Martin) who has a strong emotional and romantic connection with Jane, but is initially unaware of  the complex dynamics between her and Jake (hence the Its Complicated title).",1450828800,,953,4.864197530864198

The 1st time I saw it on a plane, you could hear laughter erupting from the entire cabin, & for me, after several viewings, I still get a smile on my face & chuckle out loud. But if I'm really honest, I'm an empty nest, middle age woman, & this is every middle age woman's dream scenario. Two men fighting over her, thinking she's sexy. She has lovely grown children, a beautiful house, fun girl friends & a great job. Yet there's no envy on my part. The characters give me hope in some strange way. That we can get through this empty nest, old age thing, & just maybe something wonderful could happen. I will come back to visit the characters in this movie several more times, no doubt.

Streep and Baldwin pay a formerly married couple who have been apart for 10 years.  The wedding of their daughter brings them back together, and they have a fling.

The movie holds together well after six years.  The topic is a bit far-fetched, but it uses this plot device to examine how two older adults handle divorce, children, in-laws, and missed opportunities.

to the divorce from Baldwin.  Steve Martin had gone through a soul ripping divorce himself & comes into Streep's life
after she begins having an affair with her ex-husband (Baldwin), who left her for some little flea bag.  I would say that
would be karma for the ""new"" wife of Baldwin.  Even she could still see the love & respect & the bond you have with
your spouse or ex-spouse, after decade(s) of marriage & raising children together!  The ending wasn't what I expected;

4085365,4,B0038JE376,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The story-line is that Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin got divorced ten years ago, and meanwhile he's married a young hot totty with a little terror of a boy. They meet up again at their youngest son's graduation, but because the hot totty didn't come, they end up sharing a few too many drinks at the hotel bar and rekindling their romance.

A great conflict ensues about whether or not they'll get back together, about Meryl Streep's being the mistress and getting stood up when the hot totty changes her plans, and the extra issue that Streep's architect (Steve Martin) is entering her life as a possible love interest, a much more mundane but sensible guy.

I won't spoil the ending, because you don't know what's going to happen right up until the very end, and I swear the resolution could have gone so many ways.

Why I liked it -- well, Streep is superb as usual. She is a character who is ageing gracefully, but so aware of the march of time. Baldwin and Martin are, in reality, showing their age and their frozen Botox faces, but you can believe that Baldwin still has sex appeal while Martin is a safer bet. I like how it's about a 60-something woman who is starting again in love after working her way through a messy and hurtful divorce, and becoming the object of men's affections without being a bit of hot totty herself.

I also really liked the character of the future son-in-law, Harley (played by John Krasinski). In one scene, he happens to be meeting the wedding planner at the same hotel where Streep and Baldwin have arranged one of their illicit rendezvous, and the antics that Harley goes through to hide this from Streep's daughter, are laugh-out-loud funny.

To be perfectly honest about the contents, though, it is a film based on the subject of adultery and is aptly rated R. There is a lot of alcohol involved, and one scene where they smoke pot. These are some things that people may find objectionable. There is, however, no nudity except a bit of Baldwin's bottom (comic), and profanity is minimal.

Basically, it's a film that I wish I had been able to see with my mother, but we live too far apart. Instead, I'm sending her a copy for her birthday.",1415404800,,2222,4.556390977443609

fabulous self. But it is John Krasinski (of U.S. televisions Office fame) who steals the show
and many scenes with his good guy sense of comedy. In fact, if its a scene where you are
laughing out loud, it is Krasinski who is either at the center or adding the embellishment that
makes the whole scene work. True, this film panders to middle-aged fantasies too numerous to

4085426,5,B0038JE376,"This is such a real romantic movie.  These are people that exist everywhere.  A couple with a history where they truly loved each other, but just grew apart yet had to stay in each other's lives because they share children.  They have left over unresolved feelings for each other, wondering ""Did we do the right thing?"".  One of the best things about this is that there really isn't a bad guy in this movie, just people trying to figure out what should the next part of their life be like.

The casting is so perfect, Alec Baldwin as the ex who wants to eat his cake and have it as well.  Meryl Streep as a woman who has been alone for a bit longer than she would like and decides to indulge for the sake of indulgence.
Steve Martin as a man who sees a woman who makes his heart skip and is afraid she might break it.
The younger actors playing their kids emote things that many of us children of divorce feel.
Lake Bell as Baldwin's young new wife felt real.

As for the DVD itself it played well.  However the extras are very limited, ""The Making of: It's Complicated"" and Feature Commentary.  I really wish they had added the gag real, because with this cast it should have been awesome.

I highly recommend this lovely emotional relationship comedy.",1407888000,,1253,4.3852813852813854

This movie is funny and sad at the same time. I have watched this movie at least 10 times since I received it.  I also love the music of the opening scene of the movie.  This movie just reminds me of my life so much.  That is probably why I enjoy watching it so much.  Also the bakery scene is so very enticing, everything in her shop looks so delicious - I know it is only a movie scene but it still gets a reaction out of me every time I see those over-sugared donuts Jane sends back to the kitchen.

And that's what this movie provides as a divorced couple carry on a secret affair ten years later while trying to decide if there's still a spark between them.  I couldn't have picked three better leads for this comedy.  There is just all kinds of chemistry right from the beginning, whether it be friendliness, antagonism, anxiety, or whatever...these three make it work perfectly naturally.  But come on...look at who they are.  I do wish I'd seen more of Lake Bell, despite how annoying her character was as Baldwin's second, much younger wife, but that's my only complaint.  This film is funny and worth watching over and over again.  I do wonder why so many films about divorce and new, younger spouses involve one of the original couple being a lawyer...kind of gives the field a bad rep...or a worse rep, as the case may be.

4085463,1,B0038JE376,"**This review contains spoilers**

The message this movie spreads is that an affair is a terrific ego boost if you're feeling lonely, and justified if the betrayed spouse is a cheater, too. There's some minor heartbreak, but overall, everything works to your benefit.

Jane (Meryl Streep) cheats with her married, ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin), and both feel refreshed about it. Her therapist okays the affair, saying it'll be a great learning tool for her. Her friends also cheer her on saying she's ""allowed this one"" and assure her that Agnes, the woman Jake left her for, is the one to hate.

However, it's hypocritical to hate Agnes for being greedy but then encourage Jane to be just as greedy. Being cheated on first doesn't mean two wrongs make a right.
And if her friends hate Agnes, then they must hate Agnes's son, too, because his innocent life would also get steamrolled by this affair she's ""allowed"".

Speaking of kids, neither Jane nor Jake consider how their affair might affect their kids' lives. Instead they're too busy believing if something feels good, do it. In the end, they even both agree they don't regret their affair.
They shook up the lives of their innocent kids, an innocent son, and an innocent man who's heart got broken (Adam, played by Steve Martin) all over greed....and yet, if they could do it over again, they would?

Jake insists this affair reveals his undying love for Jane, but really, it's just an excuse to run away from adult responsibilities. Jake is a narcissist who treats people like toys and when one toy breaks, he replaces it with another.

In his first marriage, Jane was a good toy because she took care of him. However, she broke when kids came along and she had to tend to them, too. He then replaced her with a new toy who adored him...but alas, that toy broke when she had a son and had to tend to him, too.

So history repeats itself with Jake running off to another toy, this time Jane again, who's waiting to be played with. She's more appealing now because with kids grown, she can tend to him again. And just like before, instead of ending one relationship before starting another, he strings both toys along because they're both still useful.

Jake treats the kids like objects, too. In one scene, he manipulates them with fake tears so they'll pressure Jane into letting him stay the night. He says he misses the kids but that's only because all that's required of him is to eat dinner (that Jane prepared knowing it's his favorite dish) and watch tv on the couch. If any adult problems occurred, he'd run off to a new toy again.

Jane's character isn't any better...though she tries to redeem herself, saying if only she didn't feel so much guilt and fear, she'd lighten up about this affair. However, for like 90% of the movie, she's giggling and squealing with laughter. Her conscience seemed fine to me.

Like Jake, she doesn't respect the boundaries of marriage. She explains her affair as wanting to see if something was still there with Jake. However, since Jake is married, she no longer had that right. Despite what her friends said, she wasn't ""allowed this one"".

I would've given this movie 2 stars had Adam left Jane like he originally planned. He was a decent guy who was too good for Jane.  Jane got angry with Jake for flaking on her once, but she flaked on Adam twice.  She also accused Jake of only thinking of himself, yet she only thought of herself when she invited Adam to her son's party to make Jake jealous.

In rom-coms, though, serious problems get neatly resolved, so Adam goes back to her. It's a bad move since not only does he deserve better, but in the scene prior, it's clear there's still unresolved feelings between Jane and Jake.
So I could neither root for this couple like I was supposed to nor support the warped message that greed is good.",1403222400,4,3847,4.621700879765396

These are real people with complicated lives, and the film doesn't shy away from showing their foibles, triumphs, and astoundingly bad decisions at times.  Great acting, great writing, great story (and familiar to anyone who is divorced), great direction, and many memorable scenes that stay with you for a long time afterward.  I am not sure the wealth displayed was necessary for the story -- it leaves a bit of a bad taste. On the other hand, Meryl's house and garden are so perfect it is just as fun ogling them as it is watching the actors, even if they do become a bit of a distraction from the many funny scenes.",1397952000,,714,4.51937984496124

Nice to see a light hearted lilting around Ms. Streep, as opposed to her angst ridden roles (which by the way she is magnificent as well).  Mr. Baldwin is my favorite.  He is such a lovable - sympathetic - character. Of course, his acting is always superior.  Doesn't matter to me, if he's somewhat of a supposed psycho in real life.  He always gives his best on the screen.  I like his vulnerability about being fat, but yet still sexy and attractive as he always is.  John Krasinski - scene stealer when he shows up.

I remember sitting in the theater viewing it for the first time with my friend, Donna, and hearing the laughter throughout the entire theater. People audibly gasping and shrieking when the funniest things happened on screen.

Nancy Meyers always delivers films that people love. I was surprised to see how many films I have loved over the years that she was involved with in one way or another....The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, What Women Want, Father of the Bride 1 and 2, Protocol, Private Benjamin. REALLY?  She is a GENIUS!!  (I would love to meet her one day and just talk to her for an hour--although she'd find me quite inane and boring, I'm sure!)

Back to the film...pairing Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep and Steve Martin was pure brilliance. You literally go through every possible emotion in this film. MEN LIKE IT TOO. It is NOT a chick flick!

4085623,5,B0038JE376,"This movie is such a delight, even the second time!  It has an amazing cast in the incomparable Meryl Steep, Steve Martin, and my favorite naughty boy, Alec Baldwin, in a part that must have been written specifically for him because it is just PERFECT.

The set up: Steep and Baldwin have been divorced for a decade.  He dumped her for the much younger trophy wife who is turning out to be the booby prize -- she's angry, demanding, and has the devil's spawn as a child she's brought to the marriage, and now wants another child from hell, this time with Baldwin as poppa.

Then comes the out-of-town gathering for one of the Steep-Baldwin children's college graduation, Baldwin flying solo. Streep [tho anticipating dinner with her 3 kids is left alone so they can attend another party] finds herself at the hotel bar at the same time as Baldwin. Cocktails and witty banter leads to dinner, MULTIPLE bottles of wine and their old spark reignites with an explosion!  Cut to the post-coital scene and Meryl looks dazed and incredulous and Baldwin is glowing and incredulous.

They get back to Santa Barbara and the affair continues with many funny twists and complications, including the entrance of a new person in Steep's life, a very appealing architect in the character played by Steve Martin.  Now, we have a triangle and it just gets better and better.

Streep is so acclaimed for her dramatic roles -- she channels her characters [such as Julia Child or Margaret Thatcher] -- but she is also quite the accomplished comedienne!  Baldwin and Martin are also perfect in their roles -- so glad Nancy Meyers gave Steve Martin a chance to be a 'wild and crazy guy' for a while :)

This movie is pure escapism! IMHO, exactly what a movie should be:)  Steep must have gotten a hell of a settlement in the divorce from Baldwin because, WOW, she lives in quite the hacienda -- totally to die for!  She owns a gourmet bakery emporium and is a celebrated cook -- she seems to indulge in all her creations but never kvetches about calories.  She doesn't even seem to really work very much.  It's the life we can only wish for, I'm sure even Meryl Steep herself! LOL

My one serious criticism of this movie are the Steep-Baldwin kids -- all three are sniveling whiners still reeling from a divorce that happened ten years earlier, and don't seem to care a fig about their parents' situation or their happiness together or apart, just how it impacts them.  Only the older daughter's fiance is a good character -- he figures out the Streep-Baldwin affair and not only keeps their secret, he helps hide it from the rest of the brood, which is also very funny.

That said, this movie will make you ROTFL.  Not just the first time, but as an encore delight!",1373241600,,2744,4.611111111111111

Meryl and Alec and Steve do an excellent job, and it reminds me of one thing all women should be aware of -- if a man cheated on you once, don't let him come back, he WILL do it again. It's a backstory about a man who will live his life thinking the grass is always greener on the other side, even if the ""other side"" is what he already had that he, stupidly enough, let go of.",1373155200,,521,3.7889908256880735

Im not really a Baldwin fan but Alec Baldwin kills it in this movie,it is just a hilarious comedy that had me laughing alot. I thought it was a good movie on the overall. Plus i got too see one of my favorite actresses Lake Bell in the movie as Baldwins new wife and hes having an affair on her with his ex-wife. Just straight up crazy funny story but real to life. I liked it and im sure you will too.",1371772800,,818,4.024539877300613

I thought Meryl, Alec (who I usually don't care for), and Steve Martin were terrific together.  I loved the family togetherness and thought the son-in-law was a hoot!  At my age, I appreciated ""cute"" humor and the lack of swearing and enjoyed the interations of the family members.  We laughed out loud at the comments or actions in the movie for the first time in awhile. I guess I'll categorize this movie as one of my ""middle age"" favorites.... along with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in ""Something's Gotta Give"".",1371427200,,624,4.544642857142857

I guess I can really relate with so many emotions Meryl's character goes through during the course of the story.  It is good to see the character grow stronger for what she has gone through, although still dealing with the original emotions involved with falling in love and being in a relationship.

leery about buying this because I had never heard of it, and if it was any good I'm sure it would have been publized due to the lead actors.  The premise of
a self centered philander trying to worm his way back into his original family when they have already gone on with their lives, and when, if he is successful in his project, will ruin everyone's life, is not funny when played by these people.  Put Chevy Chase as the man and perhaps Goldie as the woman and maybe
it works.",1350172800,,635,4.231404958677686

Alec Baldwin was funny and a bit of a cad, however, the marvelous actress Meryl Streep was a bit overwrought in her part and a somewhat of a disappointment.

4085811,2,B0038JE376,"The genesis for the story was not all that interesting good - what if a divorced couple has an affair after the divorce, and with a poorly executed script to boot, the movie was just plain bad. Meryl Streep, sorry to say, is showing her age, and Alex Baldwin, just can't act.  He broods and effects his puppy dog eyes to show emotion.  Plus, with his gut, he's just plain gross.  The story got all mixes up as well, and the characters were hardly sympathetic.  Like why the Streep character need to put an addition to an otherwise lovely house?  And what was wrong with her damned kitchen!  Ultimately, it was the story about an affair - although the only one really having an affair was the Baldwin character since he was married to the cliched younger woman and Meryl had never remarried.  And why, after ten years did he feel the need to come back to her.  Where the hell was he all those years?  Dumb.  Steve Martin played it straight, and that did not suit him.  A lot of comic talent seemed wasted, or not.

This movie delved into mostly unexplored territory as far as a ""romance"" goes... This movie was funny, original, and creative.  A must-see for you Streep fans!",1343606400,2,470,4.63855421686747

This movie pitted the perfect combination of Alec Baldwin (so so talented and smart) with Meryl Streep (what can one say about her?) with Steve Martin playing a non comedy part!!  Perfect!  If you haven't seen it, you need to. Especially for those over 40. Meryl of course plays the divorced wife of Alec Baldwin who is remarried.  I will forever love Steve Martin for doing this movie, especially his old woman voice during the marijuana haze - priceless!

The hotel scene is about the only bit that really gave a good laugh.  The few scenes at the beginning with Streep's girlfriends failed to deliver, and that could have worked into something.  There could have been more ""close encounter"" scenes like the one in the hotel.  Steve Martin's performance had nothing funny about it at all and seemed quite flat.

4085822,5,B0038JE376,I really enjoyed this movie.  It makes you realize  you don't really miss what you had until it is gone. It shows the power and strength of older women realizing their own wants and needs in life and not settling to please everyone else. It was a great comedy with a deep meaning.,1338940800,,280,4.264150943396227
4085823,4,B0038JE376,"There is a moment towards the very beginning of `It's Complicated' where Jane, Meryl Streep's character, is talking with her two daughters and her son-in-law.  It's the first time where you meet her children and their repartee with one another was so disgustingly rehearsed that I turned to my wife and said ""they must be the most annoying family I've ever seen"".  Thankfully, the children are not a major part of this movie, because I hated them.  I mean, I seriously thought about punching my television screen every time John Krasinski was on it (and she doesn't even play BLOOD, but god he tries so hard to be `cute' it made me sick).

But forget the children, because the bulk of this movie is all about Meryl `goddess' Streep, Steve `funny-man' Martin and Alec `my newfound obsession' Baldwin, and by GOD do they rock this movie!

So the film tells the story of Jane who was once married to Jake before he left her for a younger woman, the `stank faced' Agness.  Jane and Jake have a seemingly well-adjusted relationship where they can be in the same room and reminisce and basically act like adults.  Jake is obviously unhappy in his current marriage, and he starts to `miss' what he left all those years ago.  After a drunken night of surprising `activities', both Jake and Jane begin a torrid affair with each other.  The problem is that while Jane is frolicking with her ex-husband, another man, the lonely divorced Adam, is courting her.

Streep, Martin and Baldwin are all at the top of their game here.  It saddens me that everyone went crazy for Streep's Julia Child mimicry back in 2009, when her more carefree portrayal of Jane is far more complex and likable.  Martin isn't in a lot of the movie, but his brand of physical humor is used perfectly (especially in that `high' scene).  But this is Baldwin's movie.  His portrayal of Jake is flawless, right down to the baritone vocals, the perverted flourishes and the emotional frustrations.  He just steals every single scene.

I'm glad the kids are an afterthought, because I wanted to turn the movie off when I was introduced to them, but the `grownups' make this a pleasurable experience.  Nancy Meyers has a history of overstaying her welcome (both `Something's Gotta Give' and `The Holiday' were just WAY TOO LONG), but `It's Complicated' is probably her best flowing film, for it doesn't feel drawn out at all.

This is so much better than I expected it to be!",1338422400,,2432,4.695754716981132

Meryl Streep is too good an actress to have participated in such nonsense. The ONLY good thing about it was that it was about a couple in their 50's.  Most movies are about these 20-something twits, like no one over the age of 25 could possibly fall in love. Alec Baldwin is totally disgusting.",1333756800,2,410,4.230769230769231

She O.K. she couldn't hold a candle to the likes of Debroah Kerr or Gene Tierney or Bette Davis or Ingrid Bergman.  These women were stars, I mean really, really, big stars.

This is billed as a romantic comedy, maybe a smile you might get out of it.  You certainly won't laugh out loud.

To test my suspicions, I went to Target and purchased one of their DVD copies of the same film. Upon comparison, both the DVD case graphics and the DVD inside seemed much more sharp, polished, and obviously professional on the Target copy. I've never had an issue like this in the many years I've been purchasing from Amazon.com. I noticed this DVD was sold by VSource through Amazon, and NOT by Amazon directly. Nevertheless, it's disheartening that a vendor Amazon works with would sell a counterfeit copy of an item.

4085836,5,B0038JE376,"In order to enjoy this film you have to put into gear your suspension of disbelief.  If you can get over things like the main character played beautifully by Meryl Streep is a baker and yet has a sprawling estate that would put any rich person to shame. Or that her life is perfection personified from everything from her house, her friends, her kids, her architect and even her ex-husband.  We watch these types of films to escape our drab reality or to just have a good time.  This film does just that.  It gives us a good time while showcasing some relationship issues that are often absent in movies.  What happens when you end up back with your ex after many, many years have passed?

4085837,4,B0038JE376,"Meryl Streep, as usual, is excellent in this film playing a woman who has been divorced from her husband for over half a dozen years and who has not had relations with a man since that event. Alec Baldwin is given third billing but appears in the movie almost as often as Streep. He plays the ex-husband, who is now somewhat fat, who took up with a young woman with an excellent figure during his marriage, and then divorced Streep to marry her. She has a son who does not get along well with Baldwin. Baldwin is now disillusioned about his marriage and wants to have an affair with Streep. Steve Martin plays a somewhat nerdy man who develops an interest in Streep. All of this is shown very early in the film, which focuses on how Streep and Baldwin interact and whether Martin will win Streep. Streep and Baldwin have three children who are about 20 years old, one of whom is engaged, and we watch their reactions to what develops. There are some very funny episodes in the film.",1322006400,2,982,4.430939226519337

4085839,1,B0038JE376,"Where's it at?  Because I just watched this whole thing and this is not a romantic comedy.  It's tragically sad.  There's not much I could add that others haven't already, but put yourself in the lead character's shoes for a sec...

Your husband left you for a younger woman because he apparently felt being a husband and a father to your three children was a drag, the stress and pain of which brought you to need therapy.  You still have angxsty/hate dinner parties with your girlfriends over ""husband stealers"".

Roughly 11 (guesstimating) years later, your children are grown and here comes A-hat Ex and his life is becoming a drag again because his mistress-now turned second wife wants more kids (first one was a Maury baby?) and he is again feeling that not so parental twinge, can't get the balls up to just tell her he doesn't want any more (vasectomies work wonders) and comes sniffing back around because apparently you're now the attachment-free shiny.  So, you say, sure ok let's take a couple of trips on the old pony ride.

W. T. F., over?

Does anyone buy this craptastic plot?!  What THERAPIST would say ""Yeah, sure, go for it.  Sounds like fun and you might learn something.""?!  Regardless of the now second wife's karmaic commupance, he(Alec Baldwin's character) is a selfish jerk and she (Meryl Streep's) is a stupid twit and they both should be smacked.

This ex-husband tries to get back on solid earth and ground by having an affair with his ex-wife.

She accepts out of vanity at the same time as she starts an affair with her architect. That builds a silly story, but life is silly.

Add to that three children on the ex-married couple's side and one on the side of the new wife married to the ex-husband and you have it all in a nutshell. In other words it is nuts.

No offense, I like both of them so that's not it. Closer to the truth would be that 'It's Complicated' falls smack dab in the middle of the infamous ""chick flick"" genre, not my favorite category to say the least. My wife and daughter both wanted to watch it and being the kind of guy I am I joined them in the viewing experience.

I found it to be cute and witty, though perdictable. They're both talented thespians. I thought Steve Martin's performance as the timid and sensitive ""other man"" and rival was a nice counterpoint to the aggressive narcisstic Baldwin.

  The writing is intelligent and the acting is superb! I think it's geared towards people that have been in long term relationships :D

  I've been a long time fan of both Streep and Martin, and I have to say not so much Baldwin in recent years! And no, I don't watch him in 3rd rock with Tina Fey to see his comic side on there :)

  But Alec's acting bowled me over!! I was actually crying for and with him in some scenes!!!

  I won't give away the storyline but I think my favorite part was at the son's graduation party when they danced to a Beach Boy's song! Not just Streep with Baldwin, but Streep with Martin! Streep flows in and out of with such grace and ease in every film she does! The best scene IMHO!!!

That pitch perfect ability when they banter with each other that only comes with truly knowing the other. Then...WHAM! The second wife appears with all the finesse of a 16yr old. The furtive looks Janey and Jake sneak when the other isn't looking. The brief glances holding the love, loss, longing, regret...and finally...resignation.

There are so many gems throughout the entire movie as Janey struggles to find ease and permission to have an affair with a married man, explore scalp numbing plastic surgery, smoke pot, etc. She finds today life and relationships are not marked by years but abbreviated decriptors of OMG, LOL, etc.

Those of us fighting the gravity and gain of our bodies and memories can and do relate watching Janey step out of her comfort zone taking us along for the ride. I didn't LOL. I laughed out loud! I laughed like hell. John Krasinsky is the overwhelmed Greek Chorus/Parent watching as the adults hurl the clock backward. He's perfect as well.

It's not complicated. It's just perfect. My one and only complaint is not being able to buy the complete soundtrack in CD form. That is the only sadness I have attached to It's Complicated. Any chance to fix it?",1303084800,,1348,4.9035087719298245

4085853,4,B0038JE376,"whether to choose a new man or go back to an exhusband? Why choose when you can do both? I think Meryl Streep is underrated as a comic actress as all the wheels you see working in her dramatic roles are blessedly gone in comedy, as she lets loose. Steve Martin, as director Nancy Meyers says in the commentary, has an understated, almost morose role and Alec Baldwin as an unlikely hearthrob steals the picture. I liked the cast, even though John Krazinski massively overracts in everything, but all in all, it's good to see a story about grownups not in trouble or in pain.",1302480000,,574,4.476190476190476

I'd intended to view it in the theatre, but I was traveling as a financial contractor the year it was released and had little time for anything other than scheduling plane/hotel reservations and making sure I received payment for my work; I'm making up for lost time (LOL)!

It's great to see people having fun in the prime of their lives; I pray that I will live life as fully and enthusiastically as these characters seem to.

Alex Baldwin does a great job in this film, eye candy and who knew he could be so funny! I loved him in this movie.

The ending was just awful!

The very ending and ""the party segment"" is where Martin really shines and pull's a very poorly written and poorly cast  (the teens)  ending forgiveable and makes it all work.

Steve Martin out does himself -  his role was as always ""wonderfully funny and is a very loveable guy as the new love interest in Streep's life"".

Which is still too small for a single senior citizen, apparently, so she hires an oddly orange Steve Martin to build an extension which will be costlier and larger itself than many people's homes.

STARRING: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, John Krasinski, Lake Bell, Rita Wilson, Hunter Parrish and Zoe Kazan

WRITTEN BY: Nancy Meyers

DIRECTED BY: Nancy Meyers

Rated: R
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 25 December 2009

Now this is a romantic comedy! Its title may be It's Complicated, but there is nothing complicated in regards to the elements that make the film terrific. For starters it stars three of the most gifted actors working today: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. And for seconds, it's written and directed by none other than, Nancy Myers. Having previously brought us such flawless delights as Something's Gotta Give, The Holiday and What Women Want, Myers is without a doubt the Spielberg of the rom-com (romantic comedy).

What I love most about Myers is, she writes her films from the heart and then directs them from the same place. According to her DVD audio commentaries, she traditionally writes from what she has experienced in real life; and it translates beautifully in her work.

Meryl Streep stars as a middle-aged divorced mother named Jane Adler. Alec Baldwin plays her ex-husband Jake and he does it so well, you wonder if he and Jake are more similar than you'd like to think (hopefully he's just that good of an actor!).

Jake's a slime-ball but he's an attractive and charming slime-ball. This makes it easy for us to buy that he can convince his ex-wife to have an affair with him while they are in town for their son's college graduation. Trust me, the excessive alcohol he buys her plays its part in setting this into motion, which also drives the film forward. And we have a soft chuckle at the realization that the sex may have been a tad bit better for Jake, than it was for our girl!

Jake is the overly-used clich in films and in life, of a married man who steps out on his wife without the slightest bit of remorse for doing so. But Baldwin offers this all too familiar villain a fresh and wickedly funny persona that we have seldom seen in similar characters before. Slimy or not, you just can't help but like the guy. Second only to The Edge, this is my favorite performance of Baldwin's, and he's delivered a whole slew good ones.

We are able to forgive our leading lady Jane for sleeping with a married man, because his wife (Lake Bell) is not only a bitch, but Jake in fact left Jane to be with her after sowing his oats in her basket on the side, several years ago. I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm just saying it allows us to still root for Jane; mistress to a married man or not! If that doesn't have you convinced, then surely the superbly hilarious delivery of Streep's one-liner to her gal pals will: ""Turns out... I'm a bit of a slut!""

The film needs not establish the relationship of Jane and Jake for us, because it is already there. They were married for years, they have several kids together, and both of their performances have us undoubtedly believing these characters from the very first scene.

This allows time for the relationship between Steve Martin's character Adam, and Jane to grow and keep us invested there. Now we have a romance stewing between Jane and Adam, who is the guy we know she should really be with; and the jealousy of Jake when he isn't able to give Jane as much time as Adam, as he has to be home for dinner with the wife! Baldwin plays jealously remarkably well also, and he throws in a bit of immaturely to it to boot!

Adam is an architect who has been hired on by Jane to help her design an extension to her already massive home. It can be argued that this is a tad bit ridiculous as Jane lives alone in the already huge house, and probably wouldn't be able to afford such an improvement with her job as a professional baker, but the film doesn't dwell on it, nor does it make a cheesy mess out of it.

Nancy Myers is an expert when it comes to meet-cutes (the point in a film where two central characters meet; see a detailed explanation in The Holiday) in her films, and this is not only that, but also a subtext of what Jane and Adam's relationship is; Jane is in need of a makeover in her love life, and Adam is the architect that will build that for her - got it? I thought so.

There are a ton of laughs to be found in this film, particularly those where Martin and Baldwin share the screen. Baldwin's face kills me every time (as I've seen the movie numerous times now), when he glares at the two of them from across the room at a party, realizing that he may have a history with Jane, but this new guy is just that - new, and has never hurt her. You can match the laugh there, with Steve Martin's portrayal of a guy who is high at the same party, and trying to not make it so obvious. When Jake approaches him and Jane, Adam mutters to her with classic Steve Martin poise, ""Not a good time to be feelin' groovy!""

In addition to the outlandish laughter, there are also scenes of perfected cinematic romance between Jane and both men. The scene with Jane and Jake in the bathroom, and the one between her and Adam at the bakery, were my most prized moments of these.

There are some very big and well done side performances by talented actors too. These are cleverly written and directed by Myers as always, and are constantly playing off of the comedy in all three acts wonderfully. Watch for the scenes with Jane's son-in-law (John Krasinski) when he catches onto her affair with Jake and can't tell anyone.

This is the kind of writing that inspires writers to be writers. The film is filled with little moments like these, as are Nancy Myers' other films.",1293494400,,5614,4.44985394352483
4085872,5,B0038JE376,This was a very funny movie and it had a very good story to it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone even if they don't like romantic comedy.  The actors and actresses were great.  Love this movie.,1293408000,,200,4.2105263157894735
4085873,2,B0038JE376,"This film was truly moronic. The only thing that kept me going was views of the house and the new kitchen. Nice, but not worth the price of admission. Alec Baldwin was a big fat slob. Why would anyone want him? He's in the entertainment business, for heaven's sake. Doesn't he understand that physical attractiveness is part of the deal?",1293321600,,337,4.633333333333334

4085875,4,B0038JE376,"I knew I'd really like ""It's Complicated"" because the cast is fantastic. This romantic comedy is about a 50-something woman, Jane (Meryl Streep) who begins having an affair with the man she divorced 10 years ago, Jake (Alec Baldwin). In addition to being extremely confused about this crazy turn of events, Jake is currently married to the woman he cheated on Jane with during their marriage. On top of that, Jane just started seeing Adam (Steve Martin), a kind architect who seems too good to be true.

It's rare to see a romantic comedy about three people ""of a certain age,"" and that only adds to the charm of this well-executed movie. The only things I didn't like were that Jane and Jake's three children are pretty annoying, and the movie didn't have the ending I was hoping for (although the filmmakers did pick an ending that probably made the most sense). Overall, though, ""It's Complicated"" is a very fun movie that I highly recommend.",1292716800,,945,4.7272727272727275
4085876,3,B0038JE376,"The video was fun and entertaining.  However, the film was ""goofy"" - in one place the pixels were all screwed up, and in another it froze.  Too bad.  Still, the movie had a good ""girlie"" plot, especially for anyone over 50 who has been divorced, but still likes their ""X""!",1292371200,,272,4.4
4085877,3,B0038JE376,"I saw this movie in the theater and I liked it. When it came out on DVD, I bought it so that could I drool over the interiors. (Let's face it, Nancy Meyer movies are great in large part due to the set design and shoot locations.) I wasn't so impressed the second time I saw it. While it is an enjoyable movie, and Meryl Streep comes off as likable and not shrill like Diane Keaton often does, the conflict isn't really that deep. It's a movie where you can watch capable actors--walk through a script blindfolded. Without the proper casting, which the movie has, it doesn't really work. Although in all fairness, Steve Martin's character doesn't really have much to do, so he comes off as sweet, but dull.

Another thing about the movie is that the characters seem too storybook, well with the exception of Meryl's( but even she is practically perfect). Baldwin plays the charming, aging, cad to a 'T'. And if you looked up ""nice guy"" in the dictionary, you would see Steve Martin's character's face. The kids seem like they come out of an advertisement or a really old sitcom. At one point in the movie, they all (this is not really a spoiler) get into bed, under the covers, and look at their mom with sad puppy doll eyes. All three of them. In bed. With covers. Did I mention they are all adults? And at least two of them have graduated college? Unreal! It was like watching the picket fence Vanilla family. In what world do these people exist? When your dad is the coolest person in the movie, something is wrong.

Nancy Meyers likes to use scripts to project onto the screen things that have happened in her own life. She's a divorced, creative woman with clout, who loves France, and I understand that her homes are always exceptionally designed. All of her recent female protagonist reflects this.  I'd like to see her expand on it a bit. Make her characters have a few more warts, and make me really debate who to cheer for at the end. And please include the fabulous set design of course.",1292284800,5,1997,4.465753424657534
4085878,5,B0038JE376,"A light and pleasant comedy, especially for anyone on the long side of middle age with a bit of life experience under their belt, but an excellent any age ""date night"" show as well. A suprise for Steve Martin fans. Enjoy.",1292025600,,221,4.414634146341464

4085880,5,B0038JE376,"I really enjoyed this movie, it had me on my feet waiting for what was coming next, during the whole movie. This is a better movie than I thought it would be. Steve Martin has always been one of my favorite actors. It's weird how Jane has an affair with her ex husband Jake, because I didn't think a girl like her would do it, but they were married for 19 years, and they have a few kids. I think Jane should of been with Adam, and never started messing around with Jake. This kind of stuff happens in real life. It does seem that Jane and Jake are still in love after divorcing ten years ago. This movie is really cute,and funny movie, and has a lot a laughs during the movie. It's Complicated is the perfect title for this movie. Jake and Jane's relationship is on and off, then Jane says to the kids that they are not getting back together, it was a sad moment. Jane broke Adam's heart, he was falling for her. Then Adam and Jane resolve there issues, and now they are back together happily ever after.",1291507200,2,1005,4.212435233160622
4085881,4,B0038JE376,"Nancy Meyers' ""It's Complicated"" is a cheap Harlequin romance of a movie.  The story focuses on the largely self-inflicted problems of people who are actually pretty unlikeable for the most part, and many of the jokes are only so-so.

But Meyers saved her film by having Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin cast as the leads.  With Steve Martin playing a surprisingly straight supporting role, ""IC"" moves from pedestrian to pretty darn fun.

Streep plays Jane, divorced mother of three angelic kids.  She's been divorced for ten years and is confronting empty nest syndrome now that her youngest is graduating from college.  (The three kids are so absolutely boring in their own right that they are reduced to plot devices and setting.)  Streep somehow saves Jane from being despicability.  Jane lives in apparent upper-middle class domesticity, until you realize that she lives in a multimillion dollar compound in Santa Barbara that is so tastefully appointed that Sunset Magazine would do a ten-page layout on the place.  But this isn't enough for Jane - she has to have it remodeled ""so she can get the kitchen she always wanted.""  Folks - the kitchen Jane seeks to replace is a kitchen to kill for.  The plain fact is that Jane is a materialistic witch who cannot be satisfied with perfection - she needs the satisfaction of anticipating perfection to excite her.

But since she's played by Streep, we really don't care.  We love her.

Streep's ex is Jake, played by Alec Baldwin in a movie-stealing performance.  Jake is a successful attorney (natch) who left Jane for Agness (the gorgeous Lake Bell).  Baldwin plays Jake as the kind of guy who can tell a woman, ""Of course I'm unfaithful - that's who I am - but you want to have an affair with me anyway, don't you?"" and make the line work.  He is unrepentently hedonist and charming . . . and he sets his sights on Jane when they are in New York attending their son's graduation.  (The movie poster gives away the fact that Jake and Jane end up in bed - this isn't a spoiler.)  Jane - to her surprise - enjoys being the ""other woman"" in Jake's life.

Steve Martin complicates things mildly by stepping up as a candidate for boyfriend - he plays the architect who gets to redesign Jane's already-perfect residence.  Martin's performance is fine, but it is a surprise - he is so subdued and just plain-vanilla nice that we wonder why they bothered to cast Steve Martin in the role.  Come on!  He's Steve Martin!  There's got to be a dark side here somewhere, right?  By keeping Martin tightly bound in the Mr. Nice Guy role, he never seems a quite-appropriate foil for Jake.

Ultimately, this movie is a trifle about older, attractive people confronting the bad choices they made in their younger days.  The filmmakers risk much by giving Jane such a perfect, effortless life.  Jane runs a definitely-charming Northern California bakery, although she seems to put in about 30 minutes a day worth of work.  Her garden is overflowing with perfectly-ripe and photogenic vegetables, and we never see her garden except for some picture-perfect harvesting.  Her house is immaculate, yet she never cleans.  Perhaps Dobby the House Elf works for her now that the Harry Potter franchise is coming to an end.

Thanks to Baldwin and Streep, it's often hilarious, as these two actors use their boundless charm to distract you from the fact that both Jake and Jane are incredibly shallow, unlikeable people.  Watch this as a lark with friends - you'll be sure to smile.",1291248000,2,3506,4.7611940298507465
4085882,5,B0038JE376,"Two actors at their best - this movie makes my sides split and then again makes me cry all at the same because it is so similar to real life.

4085884,4,B0038JE376,"It's Complicated is a cute romantic comedy even though it's about 30 minutes too long. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin have sizzling chemistry together, who ever would've guessed??? Streep's chemistry with Steve Martin is not that electric or convincing. I love Martin but he seems so bored and his character follows Meryl around like a lovesick little puppy, Martin is good actor but I just didn't care for him in this film. I'm usually not a fan of Baldwin but I really thought he was hilarious and so adorable as Meryl's ex-husband.

I am not one to take the time to comment on something unless it is meaningful and moving to me. This will be one of my favorites and I am ordering it after I finish my review.

It is definitely one of my favorite movies. One of the scenes towards the end is the funniest part of the movie. I laughed so hard that I had tears coming down my face and could hardly breathe.

Meryl Streep lives in an impossibly beautiful house with a distant view of the ocean.  Inside, it has that perfect, casual lived-in look that can only truly be achieved with a professional decorator and an obscene amount of money.  Oh, and did I mention that she owns a French bakery and is getting ready to add a gargantuan addition to her home?  But, I digress.

The movie opens with Meryl Streep and two of her children going to New York City for the college graduation of her other son.  Alec Baldwin is also along as her philandering ex-husband.  They meet in the hotel bar one night, and one thing leads to another, and...well, you know.  That begins an affair that is complicated by Streep's meeting and interest in her architect, played by Steve Martin.

The car was quite amusing actually, as part of the plot involves various family members driving out of Meryl;s home, potentially leaving her alone and lonely.

Steve Martin plays his role as a divorced man still trying to get over his divorce but when he meets Meryl things get complicated and the fun keeps whirling.

The children are all delighted, shocked and still trying to deal with their parents' divorce of ten years ago when they find out their parents are fooling around again but for things to work out how they all want it to it becomes complicated.

You'll roll with laughter, feel the emotional ties of family and life and have a great time being in the lives of these people for 2 hours.

As a gay man with a partner of 25 years we both were glued to the movie and felt so satisfied with the picture, Baldwin, Streep and Martin have a great chemistry and we'd love to see them together in another film. Rent it, buy it but for sure see this beautifully filmed picture filled with love.

Throughout this movie, we are treated to humor, nostalgia, and a mix of poignant moments that almost leave us wanting these two to reconnect.

But then there's the appealing architect (Steve Martin), with whom she starts to connect as well.

My guess is probably the casual attitude towards marijuana that got the movie slapped with the restricted rating.  That's not to say that too many
 teenagers would be inclined to see this movie.  I'm reminded years ago of a vignette on ""The Simpsons"" where the boys are sneaking into an ""R"" rated movie and it happens to be ""Barton Fink"".  I digress however.  This picture is a joy.  Writer-director Nancy Meyers again has the pulse on love and relationships among the mature set.  I'm talking age here because Alec Baldwin's character seems to be reliving his childhood in a good way that is.  The premise of a divorced couple rekindling their past relationship in lesser hands could have misfired.  Meyers, however, not only mines the humor but tackles the morality and the effects the ""affair"" has on the ones we love.  The film is ably abetted by the performances of Meryl Streep, a restrained Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin who in his middle-age dotage has become a master comedian.

And I suppose that in our world of today when we laugh at other people's pain and awful decisions so much, this could be considered a comedy--unfortunately, we saw almost nothing funny in it.  Meryl Streep plays a character who has been divorced for ten years who gets pushed into having an affair by her manipulative ex-husband (an attorney, played by Baldwin), and the movie degenerates into a series of deceptions and lies and bad decisions that are very hurtful to themselves and others.  I suppose this could be funny, but it's presented as somehow being a ""normal"" part of dealing with a divorce that had happened ten years earlier.

It was sad and painful to watch these characters show their weaknesses and willingness to hurt others to fulfill their own selfish desires.  Baldwin is especially repulsive as an obsessed older man who even stoops to spying on his wife during one of her dates, looking in her kitchen window.

The children are poorly developed as characters, so most of what we get from them is simply reaction to what their parents say and do.

All in all, it just wasn't funny, the characters weren't always believable or likeable, and the script was simply lame.  And it lasted far too long for it to be enjoyable with these sorts of flaws.

Ok let's get to it.

Streep marries Baldwin.
Streep divorces Baldwin.
Streep is very much alone while Baldwin has gone on to remarry a much younger woman.
The two end up starting an ""affair"".
That's pretty much what the movie is about.
So........what's good?

Excellent performances from the entire cast. Streep is perfection as always.
Baldwin........great actor but for a guy who used to be one of the hottest men on Earth (Beetlejuice, Malice, The Juror)
What the heck happened to him?
Fire your plastic surgeon.
Steve Martin on the other hand must have either the world's best genetics or he has a competent surgeon.
The man simply doesn't age.
Anyway, that rant aside. Martin puts in a genuine, funny and brilliant performance so does Baldwin.

Great direction.
Perfect comedic timing.
The pacing was spot on.
I really don't have any complaints about this movie.
It's a comedy but also a serious (somewhat) look at divorce and what it does to families.
There are some genuine tear jerker parts during the second half as the affair pretty much unravels and everyone has to make their final choices.
It's was a good thing to have in the movie but I felt it was also a little counterproductive to inject so much ""seriousness"" into a comedy.
That small complaint aside.
""It's Complicated"" is an excellent film with excellent performance.
Still can't get over that Streep, is she capable of making a bad film?

4085911,5,B0038JE376,"Maybe it's because I'm an aging Babyboomer, but I love the directorial work of Nancy Meyers, who understands our generation better than nearly anybody...and when she writes a wonderfully wise comedy, and is teamed with America's finest actress, Meryl Streep, you have the potential for something really special. While ""It's Complicated"" may not rank as the finest film in either woman's career, in a year of overblown sequels and overwrought dramas, it is a breath of fresh air, and is certainly one of my favorite films of 2010.

The plot is something many of us can understand...years after a divorce, the ex-wife (Streep), facing an 'empty nest' as the last of her children leaves home, is seduced, casually, at first, by her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin, an old pro at combining smarmy and sincere). Because she's vulnerable, she 'gives in', despite the fact that the break-up put her into therapy, and he's been married for 10 years to the 'hot' younger woman (Lake Bell), he dumped her for. She knows their 'fling' is wrong, and she has met a really wonderful guy who likes her (Steve Martin, fabulous in a surprisingly subdued performance), but the ex-husband feels so good having his 'secret affair', he begins aggressively pursuing her. Back in Hollywood's 'Golden Age', we might have rooted for Baldwin and Streep to reconcile (consider ""The Philadelphia Story"" and it's musical clone, ""High Society""), but Meyers understands today's far more complex issues, and, with kindness and humor, explores the impact of the couple's actions on Streep's children, her friends, and even Martin (in a wild laptop sequence). The resolution is very satisfying, I'm happy to say!

The supporting cast is first-rate (as in all of Nancy Meyers' films), especially the adult children (Hunter Parrish, Caitlin Fitzgerald, and Zoe Kazan), and Streep's son-in-law-to-be (the scene-stealing John Krasinski). And the women of the film are a 'Who's Who' of terrific veteran actresses (including Rita Wilson, Mary Kay Place, and Nora Dunn).

As for Meryl Streep...the older she gets, the more beautiful, sensual, and funny she becomes...She's worth the love of both men, and more!

4085913,3,B0038JE376,"Nancy Meyers makes smart, funny romantic comedies for thinking adults.  Her 2003 ""Something's Gotta' Give,"" with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, was a near-classic of the genre.  Though her latest, ""It's Complicated,"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, is nowhere near as good as that earlier film, it still manages to tickle the funny bone (from time to time) while providing us with a chance to watch some of Hollywood's most seasoned players still performing at the peak of their power.

Like Keaton, Streep plays an attractive upper-class middle-aged woman who's suffering from empty-nest syndrome and a nonexistent love life.  Long divorced from the husband (Baldwin) who cheated on her, Jane has pretty much given up ever having much of a life of her own beyond her grown children and the restaurant she owns and operates in scenic Santa Barbara.  Much to her amazement, however, she finds herself rekindling a romance with the very man who left her to marry a younger woman ten years earlier.  Further complicating the issue is that Jane is also beginning to have feelings for an architect (Steve Martin) she's hired to help her remodel her house.

As in too many romantic comedies, Meyers' characters live in a squeaky-clean, white-bread world of magazine-layout homes, upscale restaurants, pricey therapy sessions, and endless wine-sipping.  And there are times when the cutesiness does get a bit out of hand, particularly in the giggly, you-go-girl scenes between Jane and her requisite bevy of gossipy girlfriends (including an underused  Mary Kay Place), who relate their latest romantic escapades all the while bemoaning just what cads men as a whole are.  And the secondary characters - mainly the divorced couple's three children and their too-good-to-be-true son-in-law - aren't particularly well developed or played (this includes John Krasinski and Hunter Parrish, who are both much better in ""The Office"" and ""Weeds,"" respectively).

But Streep, Baldwin and Martin are so confident and relaxed and play off one another with such alacrity and skill that we're pretty much willing to forgive any and all imperfections just to be able to revel in their performances.  Add to that Meyers' insights into just how complicated love and romance can be for the aging Baby Boomer set and you have the makings of a slick and enjoyable - if occasionally strained - comedy for grownups.",1279756800,,2394,5.141752577319588

I'm fine with that - deception and selfishness are part and parcel of the human condition But few films fail to bring laughter from the pain as much as this one. Meryl Streep plays Janey, the wildly successful owner of a pastry empire, divorced 10 years prior by her husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin), for a younger woman. While celebrating their youngest son's college graduation, they have a fling that threatens not only Jake's new family, but also Janey's precarious sense of personhood, their kids' emotional health and the fragile personality of a friend.  Each of Janey and Jake's utterly narcissistic decisions is deeply wounding to someone they love. Worse, friends and advisors inexplicably encourage this. It's hard to make a comedy out of that kind of recklessness. Streep mugs and sighs her way through film. It was amazing to see how many times ""<Exhales""> shows up in the subtitles when she is on screen. Steve Martin acts even more rigidly in this film than in most. During his one bit of buffoonery, playing himself while high, I couldn't help think ""Let's get small!"" from his old comedy routines. A hard-to-believe ""damaged children of divorce"" theme was tacked on for pathetic effect, as though kids in their 20s are still getting over a split that occurred ten years earlier.

4085917,4,B0038JE376,"""It's Complicated"" is a movie starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin ,and Steve Martin focuses on the lives of a wealthy divorced couple and the complicated relationship that ensues when they have an affair after being apart for 10 years.

Meryl Streep plays Jane and is fantastic as a talented cook and owner of a pastry shop.  Jane decides to build an addition to her house while dealing with the idea that, because her kids have moved out, she is alone.  She ends up getting sauced with her ex while they are in New York for their son's graduation and one thing leads to another.  In  the meantime, Jane's architect, Adam, seems quite nice and relatable.  Adam and Jane go on one of the funniest dates I have seen in a while.  The big question is ""What is going to happen in this strange love triangle?""

All of these characters are flawed but extremely likable, even the slightly neurotic wife of Jane's ex got some sympathy from me.  I like that all of the characters are middle aged, not too crazy, and could be real people.  The plot doesn't involve a seriously far-fetched cougar story line or insane and wacky antics.  My only issue with this film, however, is that it did tend to drag about around the middle.  If you can get through it without being too bored, I think you'll like the movie.

4085918,5,B0038JE376,"It is a strange notion but sometimes, with some movies, depending on when you watch the movie or in what state you're in, a movie can just rub you the wrong way, or go the other way and fit you perfectly.  I think if I saw this movie, even a year ago, I would have dismissed it as another Nancy-Meyer disappointments.  I am only thirty-one but there was still so much a single girl could relate to in the life of Meryl Streep's character and I think that's what makes this movie so charming - it is, as I see it, a fabulous chick flick for the 'cougar' age bracket.  And I thought it was fantastic.

The plot is definitely unprecedented.  The cheatee becomes the cheater with the ex-husband who is married to the mistress!  What I also liked about the writing (thanks to Ms Meyer's brilliance) is that she still made sure that Meryl's character remain vulnerable and she did not simply seize the opportunity for sweet revenge.  I also loved that I really could not predict how it all ended.

I was surprised by Steve Martin's performance in this movie. He's always played the nice dad who loves his kids.  He still was a 'nice guy' but he wasn't a dad who coached the football team or drove a mini-van but he was just a handsome architect who was pursuing a woman.  He was very likable and not overbearing.

The round table with the girlfriends was another fantastic sight to behold.  I really hope that I could still do that with my girlfriends at fifty - laugh about life and men with a glass of chardonnay and lots of dessert.

The sessions with her friends almost made me hate women; they were so insipid. Alec Baldwin, whom I love on 30 Rock, and Steve Martin, usually hilarious or at least entertaining, underplayed too much until he was playing his character stoned, and that was a pretty cliche setup. Also these actors, usually good-looking, appeared so unattractive. What happened? Alec's character was probably supposed to show some wear, but the angles from which he was filmed did not favor him at all. No one could have been more pampered or more ""perfect"" than Meryl's character; she didn't even have to let her croissants rise. Only good thing about the movie was the guy who plays Jim on The Office, but it seemed like he was in the wrong movie. Only other good thing was I saw it with a friend.",1279238400,7,928,4.596385542168675
4085922,4,B0038JE376,"Meryl Streep plays a divorcee, Jane, who is a happily single woman who owns her own successful bakery. Though she is a mother to three children, her brood has almost entirely left the nest. While at her youngest son's graduation from college, she bumps into her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin). The two have been divorced for 10 years but the chemistry between the two of them is still there. That night, the two unexpectedly have dinner together where Baldwin opens up that his new marriage is failing. Jane and Baldwin begin to have an affair which Jane believes is casual while Baldwin thinks it could be the cure to their failed marriage together. Enter into the mix, Steve Martin who plays Jane's architect who is helping her plan a renovation to her house. Martin is also divorced and he and Jane start a relationship. Of course, is is not your usual romantic rhombus because Jane and Baldwin have children. Jane is left to decide between taking a second stab at an already once-failed marriage or stepping outside her comfort zone and dating a new man.

There are as many laughs in this film as there are tender moments. Though critics differed between praise and annoyance, no one can deny the charm and charisma that these actors (and their characters) have. Perhaps the most enchanting aspect of this film, is that it is real! Families nowadays, are no longer a mom, dad, sister, brother, and dog. It's Complicated not only acknowledges these changes, but is able to make us laugh about them. Of course, it is not a deep movie with a strong message but it's not supposed to be. It's fun, light, and brings humor to today's ""complicated"" families and relationships.",1279065600,,1668,4.751724137931035

4085929,4,B0038JE376,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'It's Complicated's clever opening scene introduces us to Jane and Jake who are attending an anniversary party for old friends and appear to be married. But soon Jake is joined by his sexy younger wife, Agness, and we realize Jane is the odd woman out. To make matters worse, her youngest daughter (Jane has four grown children) is now moving out of the nest and Jane is all alone in the house. Her children are concerned for her but she reassures them that she'll be fine. Jane pours herself into her work and when the head of the architectural firm comes by with new blueprints for an addition to Jane's house, she's not listening when he introduces her to Adam who actually is the project manager, responsible for all the new designs. Finally, Jane meets with a bunch of her lady friends who urge her to start dating again.

The break into 'Act 2' occurs when Jane and Jake are booked in at the same hotel to attend their youngest son's graduation from college. When Jake's hyperactive son from his second marriage takes ill, Jake finds himself at the hotel alone. The estranged couple suddenly find themselves opening up after all these years over a series of drinks. Streep and Baldwin are at the top of their game as they become more and more inebriated, leading to their first sexual encounter since their divorce. We see the aftermath of said encounter with Jake admitting that he had a great time but with Jane expressing her doubts (not to mention barfing in the bathroom after having one too many). Note how Streep is hunched over the toilet bowl and we suddenly cut to the college commencement, a great little edit. I also loved how the sensitivity of the characters are brought out--Jane whistles as the youngest son appears in his cap and gown but suddenly bursts into tears (with Jake glancing at her); later it's Jake's turn to get all sensitive while eating dinner with Jane and all the children. He praises Jane and admits that he wasn't there emotionally for the kids. He gets all misty-eyed but the son urges him to 'pull himself together'. Jake caresses Jane with his foot under the table, expressing his continued interest in her. The children make it harder for Jane by admitting that it's so nice to have the family all together again.

After the graduation is over, Jane fails to respond to Jake's emails so he comes over to her house and begins making a pitch for her again. He's full of witty lines such as ""life is short"" and ""people in nursing homes with plants live longer"" and she responds by stating that she never realized what a good lawyer he was. More witty lines and situations: Jake says this is ""very French of us""; Jane reveals to her friends she's having an 'affair' with ""Agness Adler's husband""--and her friends squeal with delight! At first the affair has a positive effect on Jane's mood; an employee asks ""what did you do to your hair"" and she orders him to ""change the breakfast menu"".

Things eventually begin to go sour when Jake gets jealous over Jane's interest in Adam. Before you know it, Jake is spying on Jane and Adam as they have an innocent date at Jane's home. Perhaps the weakest part of the movie is Steven Martin's character. He's such a dour, wussy guy due to his inability to get over his divorce that wonders what Jane sees in him at all. Most of the scenes of Jane and Adam's burgeoning romance are slow-moving until things pick up when the two end up getting stoned on marijuana at son Luke's graduation party. Agness notes that Jake and Jane are unusually close as they dance together and this leads to the second act crisis where Jake splits up with his second wife. Interspersed between the graduation party scene and Jake showing up at Jane's home, begging to be taken back by her, is that unnecessary, long-winded encounter between Jane and Adam, preparing a batch of chocolate croissants.

Things get back on track with Jake's revelation that he's left Agness and the children are all in tears as they can see their father is cracking up. They pressure Jane into letting their father stay over, even though she knows it's not a good idea. Note the wonderful transition between Jake in tears, the kids' emotional reaction and Jake at the dinner table, completely comfortable in the family setting, gorging himself on a sumptuous meal.

I found the scene leading to the climax, where Jake parades himself butt naked in front of Jane's laptop, thus temporarily shattering Adam's dreams of a relationship with Jane, to be a bit over the top. But everything after that works oh so well. Jane and Jake's children reaction after they learn of their parents' affair is perfect: they all drive off, leaving Jane staring up at the rustling leaves in the trees, as she falls asleep on the couch. And then Jane pulls herself together the next and goes over tor reassure her children that she needed to ""experiment"" to see if there was any 'spark' left between her and Jake. She reveals the spark isn't there anymore and with her honesty with the children, Jane restores the trust between them and herself.

The conclusion is poignant: Jake is waiting for Jane back at her home and they have one last conversation on the swing. Jane sums it all up when she acknowledges that they both ""blew it the first time around"". Jake finally faces the reality that Jane has moved on. The heartfelt theme of the movie becomes manifest: in order to grow, people sometimes must change, which also may involve some kind of loss.",1278288000,,5515,4.644467213114754
4085930,1,B0038JE376,"I can't remember when I have seen such a poor plot premise than this movie offers.  The wife (Streep) is made out to be a buffoon without a life purpose that is interdependent on finding who she is in her 50's by reigniting an affair with her ex husband.  He (Baldwin) is a worthless excuse for a man who originally left his wife for a ""younger more attractive"" woman.  He now does not get along with her either and the buffoon takes to bed with him at a family gathering after getting drunk.

The buffoon in one scene is shown as an independent and successful business woman about to put on a addition to her home that would cost at least $300/K.  In the next scene she is a bumbling emotionally co-dependent marm that can't think for herself and allows herself to be used up like a limp rag.

I am dissappointed in every part of this movie.  Especially in two aging actors that apparently are following the lead of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino that seem to take any script regardless of content to milk the public with yesterday's successes.

I enjoyed this romantic romp through romance, failed romance, and rebirth.  What an enjoyable evening I had watching this surprisingly enjoyable film.  At first I had thought I was in for an extended Barilla Pasta Commercial celebrating middle aged sexuality.  Although, that's a fair description of this film, that's not to say I didn't fall in love with everyone in this movie, except the pretty boy son who was too good looking to be sympathetic towards.

I enjoyed the film.  That being said, I was very disappointed in the ending and disagreed with it forthright.  What's a matter Merryl, can't handle a little excitement?  Think of your children.  Five stars for the movie, 1 star for Merryl's poor selection at the end.  The man you chose offers you nothing compared to what the man you didn't choose gave you.

4085945,2,B0038JE376,"....this movie clonks along, with predictable...well, complications.

The surface glamour distracts from the clonking sensation. This movie is really a fantasy about all the trappings of 97th-percentile net worth: the stunning, multi-acre, lovingly and tastefully appointed Montecito ($$$$) home to which Meryl's character has repaired after the blow of her divorce. The sub-plot involving a home addition and a dream kitchen, when the kitchen she already has would be a dream for most of us. (Note the precise dent in the refrigerator door, to suggest it really isn't so dreamy). The almost-as-awesome nearby home owned by her mid-twenties daughter and her fiancee (Krasinski, who gives this material a solid and only occasionally over-the-top shot). It's all about surfaces, really: the Porches and Audis and Priuses for the kids, the expensive hotels, the Christian Louboutin shoes; the high-gloss beauty of every single material thing, down to the croissants.

It is always a joy to watch Streep. The director had her spinning a little too hard in some scenes -- lots and lots of head-back hilarity -- but she can reliably wring moments of comic delight and sincerity even out of insincere material like this. Alec Baldwin plays his role with less suppressed glee than he offers on 30 Rock, but the powerful, rich, snarky, entitled, and thus somehow sexy heart of his character is similar. So are the fabulous eyes, which he flashes to particular effect here. But Steve Martin was not the right pick for this role. His character was supposed to be low-key but ardent, and here Martin is neither. His face and eyes telegraph so very little that, rather than low-key, he seems stupefied with boredom, even when he's grinning in that maniacal, old-school Steve Martin way later on.

In this rating system, with zero stars not possible, one star must mean 'the worst.' This is better than that, thanks again largely to Streep and Baldwin, with a good assist by Krasinski, and with all the things we'd come to expect from a filmmaker of this director's experience. But it is also escapism without real heart; funny in certain moments, but mechanical and, at cringe-worthy moments, pretty vapid. Worst of all for a romantic comedy, it's really not much of either.",1276387200,3,2261,5.056300268096515
4085946,5,B0038JE376,I laughed out loud 50 times at this flick. Alex Baldwin and Merryl Streep are the best. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!,1276300800,,103,4.777777777777778
4085947,4,B0038JE376,"I would say this is one of the more difficult movies to classify. It tries to be a number of things. On the one hand, it tries to be a serious movie about relationships, in this case divorce and its aftermath. It also tries to be a bit more of a lighthearted movie with some funny scenes. Finally, it tries to be a romantic movie in which a person in a bad relationship has a few close calls with someone better before finally ending up with that person.

This is the story of a woman who has been divorced for 10 years and is finally starting to put her life back on track although she admits to some feelings of loneliness when with friends. Early in the movie, she finds herself alone at a hotel restaurant with her ex-husband who is now married to a younger woman with an annoying child. Her ex-husband convinces her to have dinner and after a good deal of wine and a some fun they end up having a romantic tryst. Back home, her ex-husband continues to pursue a re-kindling of their relationship which leads to a number of complicated scenes and situations, including problems with the woman's new boyfriend. In the end, after a number of twists and turns, she ends up with the new guy.

The acting in this movie is pretty good. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin do a pretty decent job with their parts and Steve Martin makes for a convincing Mr. nice guy as the new boyfriend. The ex-couple's children turn in a somewhat less convincing performance, but they have relatively minor parts. I'm giving the movie 4 stars and not 5 because I wasn't sure to laugh cry or cringe as the tone of the movie changed various times. However, that being said, it's a pretty decent little film and worth checking out.",1276300800,,1703,4.420382165605096

4085950,3,B0038JE376,"As a fan of romantic comedies, I found ""It's Complicated"" to be only mildly funny and somewhat romantic. It follows the standard formula of having a woman and two men - one whom she shouldn't like or date but does anyway and another who is the more obvious choice but she messes things up with. There's nothing wrong with using an old formula (""there is nothing new under the sun"") but this movie doesn't add much to it. The only real twist is that Jane (Meryl Streep) used to be married to Jake (Alec Baldwin), the guy she shouldn't get involved with but does anyway, and now she's the ""other woman"" since he's been remarried. Somewhat ironically, Jake is married to the woman with whom he cheated while previously married to Jane. Adam (Steve Martin) is the architect working on Jane's addition who somehow knows exactly what she wants, and is the guy she should be dating.

Meryl Streep is very good (rarely is she anything less) and is basically the highlight of the movie. Her character is clearly conflicted over her affair with her ex and she plays it rather well. Alec Baldwin is fine playing the ex who is clearly unhappy with his new marriage and regrets his past mistakes, although he hasn't changed much since then. Steve Martin can play understated characters as well as he does comedy, but he seems under-utilized here.

There are some funny moments, but overall the movie feels a bit too repetitive. Some moments, such as when the four grown-up children of the divorced couple are in bed together commiserating, do not feel genuine. Streep's performance is the one saving grace here, but even that isn't quite enough for me. Unless you're a huge fan of romantic comedies or Meryl Streep, I would recommend passing on this one.",1275955200,,1741,4.686274509803922

Its settings are beautiful (Santa Barbara, nice interior of house, a nice-looking bakery), and the plot is a middle-aged woman's fantasy:  ex-husband who strayed ends up falling back in love with his ex-wife.  With Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, & Steve Martin, the movie is well-acted & filled with funny scenes.  Alec Baldwin, in particular, is physically comedic in this one, carrying & moving his paunchy body in humorous ways.  Steve Martin, on the other hand, seemed like he had to restrain himself, not really let loose until the pot/party scene.

Overall, it's a likable, funny movie.  More than the plot, the whole movie is a middle-aged woman's fantasy... a beautiful house, great children, a fulfulling job, nice group of female friends, an ex who wants you back, & a new man.  What else could you want?",1275868800,,909,4.973509933774834

4085961,4,B0038JE376,"A divorced couple (Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin) find themselves having an affair. He's married to a younger woman and she has a child with the man she left him for and now she's back with Baldwin. Baldwin wants to get back together, but Meryl is interested in seeing how things go with Adam (Steve Martin), a divorced architect who's interested in her. Which leads Baldwin to get jealous and act childish.

  Nancy Meyers knows how to make romantic comedies that are actually fun and funny. It's Complicated, is much better than Something's Gotta Give though, which Meyer's also directed. The movie is just better written and also funnier. Something's Gotta Give was funny, but it dragged out and over-stayed it's welcome I think.

  I'll just say that the scene with Steve Martin, Meryl Streep and a....joint is hilarious. Martin is still one of the best comedians...when he's not in Pink Panther films that is. While Meryl Streep can simply do anything she puts her mind to, even be funny. I wasn't in a hurry to watch this movie, but I'm glad I did, it's really entertaining.",1275523200,2,1080,4.748663101604278
4085962,2,B0038JE376,"One thing needed to make a book, movie, or even a story work is a change in the main character.  It's the change in the character that drives the plot and that gives it a resolution. Even cheap reality TV shows know this, and generate conflict to keep us watching. But this simple point is completely lost to the people who made this movie.

The problem with this movie is that Janie, Meryl Streep's character doesn't change. Not one whit. The person in the last scene is exactly the same sad sanctimonious person she is in the first scene. She isn't better, she isn't worse. Lots of things have happened to her: she had an affair with her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin), she broke up his second marriage, she broke off the affair (also with little emotion), and she met another man (Steve Martin) who could, at least, be a friend.

But at the end of it all, this movie didn't really have either a story or an ending -- it just stopped. That's sloppy, especially from experienced filmmakers.

But there are plenty of other small things that reflect sloppiness, a inconsistent timeline, actions on the part of characters and in the writing that make you expect one reaction and you get another, cardboard villains, and a chorus of vile-mouthed middle-aged women friends.

It's not the main actors' fault; their performances are lovely and are the only thing worth watching here. But in the end, no matter how you feel about divorce, the movie is deeply unsatisfying. The only people I can think of who could possibly enjoy it are divorced Baby Boomer women who are just like Janie, who will see it and say ""That's my life!"" But how many of us have lives that would make a decent movie?",1275436800,6,1679,4.583333333333333

It's intended to be a comedy and there are spots were it is. but there were other spots that left me feeling embarrassed for Streep.  That feeling didn't include Baldwin. He came across as a self-centered cheater since he had remarried. Steve Martin whom Streep becomes interested in as her senses return following the hanky-panky with Baldwin is adequate as a caring suitor; however, his role is actually minor and without any comedy.

Overall I was mildly disappointed with the movie.",1275350400,,608,5.00990099009901

It's all about what he wants. Sex with his ex is hot and steamy and terrific. So to hell with his wife, to hell with his young son, and forget that the Meryl Streep character is trying to get something going with the rather sweet Steve Martin architect. It's all about him, and he clearly doesn't care about messing up several innocent people's lives.  Not romantic, not comedy  Also, what other reviewers are saying is correct. How is it that all the lead characters in rom coms live so lavishly? Meryl Streep sells chocolate croissants and has enough money to hire an architect to build a 3000 square foot addition to her house? When she lives there by herself?  Get real.

Coen Brothers fare that come from that over-the-top, cartoonish,

But I must say that it was very refreshing to see a romantic comedy which
was intelligently done and came from a mature adult perspective.

The Santa Barbara setting is spectacular, I mean, WHO would not want to live there?  This is a movie that really doesn't lull, its pace is right on the money.  Frankly, I new I'd love Streep and Baldwin, but it was Martin that really made this movie for me, he is without question the most under-rated actor in Hollywood.  As for the cinemaphotography it is in word: spectacular!, I wanted to jump through the LCD and bask in the SoCal glow.  The supporting parts were well played as well, especially by the actor playing Streeps soon to be son-in-law.  I have to say the only thing I'd change about this fantatic film would be the actor that played Streeps youngest child, he seemed to be in wayyy over his head, it was as if he stumbled in from some show on the CW, he really needs some seasoning as an actor and playing against Streep and Baldwin was a trial by fire that left him scorched.

Although I like Alec, he's great and funny on SNL shows, as a movie actor... well... he's really stinks!. In this film, I guess they tried to make an experiment throwing him with our beloved Meryl and our great comedian Martin. The hope was, I guess, that with the plenty talent of the last two, the shortcomings of Alec would be less noticeable. But... it did not work... Somehow I felt Meryl was holding back on her acting, as if she was making tremendous efforts not letting us see that natural shine she's got, and that we are so used to see. I had to struggle to watch the movie to the end. Alec made me feel embarrassed, his acting was really bad, not funny at all... I actually felt pity for him. Those funny sketches he plays so well at NBC shows, have nothing to do with movie making, and much less when you have to act with actors of extraordinary talent like the other super stars in this movie. We love you Alec, and we love to see you in TV sitcoms. But just the movie screen requires a whole different type of character than what you can offer. If they want to save Alec's career, have him started his own comedy show, or talk show, something... for TV.

4085982,4,B0038JE376,"With Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, you know, even if the plot is lame, you will get the best acting possible.  Well, the story isn't lame, but is held together by the magic of Meryl Streep and her ability to crawl into her feelings of a divorced woman of 10 years is miraculous.  I know women like her; she is very capable, built a business after her husband marries a younger woman and becomes subservient, yet demanding, with her own chilren.  She is an interesting mother, she is her own woman yet she will dance around her children's plans and feel awful when she's not included.

The ex-husband, Alec Baldwin, who maintains a somewhat peripheral relationship with his three children, has found himself hotly attracted to his ex-wife.  His present wife wants more children and the fertility scenes are hilarious.  As a successful attorney, he knows how to argue and turn the case in his favor.  He believe he wants his ex-wife once again and is accustomed to getting what he wants. There is a marked physical difference between the present, sexy wife and the 50+ ex-wife who seems to be dressed in Eileen Fisher in every scene.  The most startling revelation is that ex-husband had never experienced the pain of loss, the loss of a great love. Steve Martin plays his role to a tee. He is the divorced architect, who has been shattered by his ex-wife, and is starting to rebuild his life (excuse the pun).  I enjoyed the movie but without the acting talents, it would have been a rather superficial chick flick.",1274054400,,1529,4.675373134328358

Sure, it's a little sleazy, with Meryl Streep having an affair with her own ex husband, and then there is Steve Martin's character.  For adults, this is not material or subjects that do not happen.  If this were a film about a 20'ish couple, or a teen film (with the same content), they would not work.  I think that the cast of Baldwin, Martin and Streep make it work.  At the stage of life the adults find themselves, the children have to just let things happen.  After all, what can they say?  They are adults, and mom and dad!

The film is surprisingly honest about relationships and life.  We make mistakes, grow up and move on.  The characters in this film do that.  Even the humor is not forced here.  No fart jokes, no body parts hanging out, except the laptop cam shot of Baldwin which was very funny!

All things considered. This film is very good, and is recommended for those 20 and over.  The copy I viewed was PG, but I would consider it more of a R type film with the sexual content.",1273708800,,1169,4.342592592592593

4085991,4,B0038JE376,"The romantic comedy genre often suffers from trite plots and insipid dialogue, not to mention exaggerated acting. ""It's Complicated"" may not be the most original romantic comedy in terms of plot, but what elevates it above an average romantic comedy is the excellent casting. Veteran actress Meryl Streep plays successful bakery owner Jane who has been divorced from her ex, Jake (played by Alec Baldwin) for the past 10 years. The divorce was initially quite acrimonious, as Jake left Jane for a younger woman and their three children, all grown up, have gotten used to the idea of their parents being divorced, to the extent that the family gets along quite well in the present.

Jake is under pressure from his young wife to start a family, and reluctantly goes to a fertility clinic. Meanwhile, Jane is planning an addition to her house, and the project is overseen by architect Adam (played by Steve Martin). When the family gets together for the youngest son's graduation from college, Jake and Jane end up having an affair and this triggers all sorts of confused feelings in Jane - why is she doing this? Is she not over Jake, is it revenge, or is she just lonely? Meryl Streep plays her character credibly to the extent that the viewer can truly empathize with her predicament. She lends Jane an air of vulnerability, whilst also imbuing her with strength and courage when she needs to make the right decision. This is especially significant when Adam begins to develop feelings for Jane and a close bond forms between them, though Jake is also obviously still in love with Jane. What is a woman to do?

Alec Baldwin plays his role as the emotionally immature Jake with panache, and the credible chemistry with Meryl Streep makes their scenes together truly a pleasure to watch, and entertaining to say the least. I felt that Steve Martin did not share this strong chemistry with Streep, and his role appeared overshadowed by the two leads. A stand-out performance worth mentioning here is the role of Harley (the soon to be son-in-law) played by John Krasinski. His comic timing is perfect and subtly played, especially in the scenes where he discovers to his horror, that his divorced soon-to-be father-in-law and mother-in-law are having an affair. Poor Harley is then left with the unenviable task of pretending he does not know anything whilst trying to keep the situation under control.

This middle-brow 2009 romantic triangle farce is no exception as it showcases Meryl Streep as Jane, the successful, late-fiftyish owner of a Santa Barbara boutique patisserie and the mother of three grown children. A decade after her divorce, she still has a congenial relationship with her ex-husband Jake who in true Hollywood-clich style, left her to marry a much younger woman with abs of steel and a bratty five-year-old. As an empty-nester trying to get used to youngest daughter Gabby going off to college, Jane succumbs to Jake's charms in the bar of a New York hotel where the ex-spouses are staying to attend their son's college graduation.

Their alcohol-infused one-night-stand kick-starts the predictable comedy hi-jinks with Jane's more-recently-divorced architect Adam thrown in the mix for good measure. Considering the star wattage involved, I was surprised how bored I was with the ensuing shenanigans despite the crack comic performances of Streep and Alec Baldwin as the smitten-again Jake. The first problem is that the movie feels overlong at 121 minutes with a slow set-up and an even more gradual wrap-up unfortunately peppered with a sitcom-level,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-s-Company/dp/B0000DFZ5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three's Company</a>-style episode involving a webcam. The second problem is casting Steve Martin, surgically altered and looking like a waxwork, as Adam, a role that begs for flashes of his old wild-and-crazy persona but ends up being a persistent milquetoast who hardly seems romantic rival enough for the far more vibrant and impulsive Jake. Even Martin's brief moment of comic glory during the pot-smoking scene is stolen by Streep's more natural, free-wheeling style.

The rest of the cast is given short shrift in Meyers' belabored screenplay with Lake Bell in the woefully underwritten role of Jake's predictably curt wife and the young actors playing Jane's children - Caitlin Fitzgerald, Hunter Parrish and Zoe Kazan - particularly unctuous and irritating. However, John Krasinski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Away-We-Go/dp/B0021L8UOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Away We Go</a>) shines in the minor role of eldest daughter Lauren's affable husband who unexpectedly discovers the affair between Jane and Jake in an amusingly slapstick fashion. John Toll's crisp, lifestyle-magazine-style cinematography makes the movie feel like an extended Food Network program. The 2010 DVD offers just one significant extra, a decent feature-length audio commentary track with Meyers, Toll, executive producer Suzanne Farwell, and editor Joe Hutshing.

I cried at the end. ""It's Complicated"" is really not so complicated. If you're getting a mixed message about my feelings for this movie, that's how I feel, too.

What I did not like:
1. Meryl Streep's very annoying, affected mannerisms. They reminded me too much of Jessica Lange's annoying mannerisms.
2. Alec Baldwin's over-the-top loopy-dopey crush on what he lost and cannot have again.
3. Mucking around in a dead relationship
4. Having three tiny-faced children from two big-faced parents
5. The silliness of the rich who can have it all except for what all of the rest of us also want
6. Fairy tale ending

What I loved:
1. That a movie features two older people who ""fall in love"" and have sex!!
2. The fact that quality aging actresses like Streep can be given such a lovely script about love among 50-plus people
3. That a broken family can be re-united--happily and peacefully--even for a day or two (this is a wow factor)
4. How foolish a man looks married to a woman half his age
5. A movie starring older actors/actresses
6. Fairy tale ending with a twist: Instead of the surety of a happily-ever-after, the presentation of a possibility. Romantic dreamers will see a sure thing, but those of us with dead, broken hearts see a possibility that is as pleasing as a certainty and more realistic.

I cried at that possibility. A woman that age and a man that age finding each other? Wow!",1273276800,3,1566,4.792592592592593

4086000,4,B0038JE376,"""It's Complicated"", starring the awesome Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin and with honorable mention John Krasinski.  I think you have to mention John Krasinski since he did steal a few scenes in the movie.  First, I liked the movie.  It was funny in parts, sad in others, endearing, heartwarming, emotional, and overall a decent depiction of the insanity that can occur in a marriage, or even long after two people are divorced.  As I have discovered firsthand, it doesn't matter if you are divorced.  Your ex-wife never goes away if you have children.  Sadly for me I am definitely not divorced from Meryl Streep though.

Anyway, the movie takes place several years after Jake, (Alec Baldwin) and Jane (Meryl Streep) have divorced.  They have three kids, two girls and a son.  One of their daughters has married.  Jake cheated on his wife, (why is it the guy has to always be the bad guy in the movies), and then married the much younger woman.  While she is absolutely smoking hot, she is a complete and total bitch.  Jane on the other hand has never found a long term love interest, but she has focused on finding herself, and has flourished in her career as a bakery owner.

Jack and Jane head to their youngest son's graduation in New York.  Jack's young tart of a wife can't make it and one thing leads to another.  Jack and Jane in up in bed.  Things really heat up when the formerly jilted wife realizes she is having some fun with her ex-husband.  He in turn figures out that she was pretty damn good, asking himself why he left her in the first place.  What do they say; the grass is not always greener on the other side.  Interestingly enough with growth comes change, and in the end Jane has left the childish antics of her ex-husband by the wayside.  Again, I sure as hell wish my ex-wife would have been Meryl Streep.

What is the word I am looking for, anyway.  There are several laughs and it becomes touching when you see the two acknowledge that they really have grown apart.  You move from feeling sorry for Jane in the beginning, to admiring the woman she has turned out to be in the end.  I guess it really does take most of us sixty plus years to finally grow up.  I wonder what I will do when that finally happens.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Alec Baldwin was great and Meryl Streep was fantastic as always.  Steve Martin played a forgettable role so he didn't have much meat, but I will always love the aging comedian.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is beyond their teen years.  It was well worth the [...] I paid onDemand.",1272844800,3,2582,4.466809421841542
4086001,1,B0038JE376,"When watching Meryl Streep in this film, it's almost impossible to believe that this is the actress who astonished everyone in ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Out of Africa."" Throughout this entire, ridiculous film, she is laughing. She is breathless, giggly, and always laughing, at seemingly anything. It's as if Hollywood insists that women become less serious as they grow older; less weighty, frivolous, and more prone to idiocy. Consider Diane Keaton: with each perfomance, she becomes increasingly moronic. You can't take these characters seriously, which seems to be the intention.

There is hardly an intelligent sentence throughout this film. I was shocked that Mary Kay Place, an excellent actress, was given one sentence of dialogue. Why even bother? How insulting. And Rita Wilson - she really needs to stop being the bubble-headed ""friend"" on the sideline. You have a scene where a group of midlife women are shreiking and laughing as though they're in grade 8. Couldn't someone have written some really good dialogue? Are we afraid to think? If your 50-something friend was having an affair with her ex-husband, there would be an opportunity for some great conversation. In this film, everything generates hilarity, usually with the help of copious amounts of wine. There are teenagers out there having deeper discussions than what you'd find here.

This movie is at times mildy amusing, but it's not funny; true comedy requires good writing. Alec Baldwin saves this shallow, vapid film from being a made-for-tv movie, but even he is wasted here.",1272844800,39,1552,5.204

4086005,2,B0038JE376,Most romantic comedies run about 90 minutes but this one dragged on for nearly two hours.  Steve Martin wasn't needed in this one.  Comedy?  What comedy!?

4086006,3,B0038JE376,"It's Complicated is a middle of the pack (at least for me) semi-romantic comedy whose primary claim to fame is that the relationship that is featured is one with more mature characters.  I'm reminded of a few other films whose names escape me, but in reality a relatively precious few other films as Hollywood tends to marginalize older stars when it comes to romantic roles.  Regardless, in most cases romantic comedies tend to succeed or fail based on the chemistry of the actors/characters and of course the story that puts the characters together.

In terms of on-screen chemistry, Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin seem to match up nicely enough with Streep also matching up reasonably well with Steve Martin.  The story that puts the pairings together revolves around the previously failed marriage of Streep and Baldwin's characters as they come together for a few life events for friends and members of their families.  We see Streep and Baldwin initially appearing as what seems to be a happy couple reminiscing over the relationship of a pair of their friends.  Quickly we find that they aren't the couple we thought they were and instead are exes that have come together for just a few moments.  Baldwin's character had moved on and married a younger woman (Lake Bell) while Streep had taken time to get herself together after the divorce.

Over the relatively peppy 2 hours worth of movie running time viewers follow Streep as she finds herself possibly renewing her relationship with Baldwin while also potentially starting up a relationship with an incredibly neurotic Steve Martin.

As a date night type film I'd guess that viewers of the female persuasion would enjoy the film more than most males would.  For me it was ok, but not much more than that, leaving me happy that it was a rental viewing rather than a purchase.  If I had a significant other that considered this one a must own for some reason I wouldn't mind having a copy in the video collection, but would probably hold out until the inevitable sale comes along.",1272585600,2,2038,4.827586206896552
4086007,4,B0038JE376,"For those of us who have been divorced, we do sometimes wonder if we had a chance to do it over again, could we make it work. Most often we know.

Meryl Streep plays a divorced woman who is a successful chef and owns a restaurant in Santa Barbara. Her ex played by Alec Baldwin is an attorney. He played around during the marriage and married a much younger woman with a young child who seems to be a devil. Steve Martin is an architect who is designing Meryl's new addition. Three grown children play a big part in this film. However, they cast the film, all three children could very well be Meryl's children.  The son graduates from college in New York City and the whole clan, minus the new wife arrives for the weekend. Meryl and her ex end up in bed after a delightful evening together. Can this be real? A relationship between Meryl and Steve develops and what is to come? A very funny scene with nudity and a computer finally brings the answer.

A light adult comedy with some nudity- Alec's butt. An interesting story, the kind of lightweight film that we all look for at times.

4086009,3,B0038JE376,"Nancy Meyers wrote and directed this film about a strange form of adultery - a form that she condones because the adulteress is the 60ish divorced mother of three and the 'victim'  is the pretty young 2nd marriage gal that the husband of the 60ish woman left her for and so that must be some kind of justice....Make sense?  Well it seems so to Meyers whose long string of 'feminist movies' (Father of the Bride I & II, Something's Gotta Give, The Holiday, What Women Want, The Parent Trap, etc) writes in her script.  The story here is a rather silly overlong joke about the affair between a divorced man and woman, with a family of kids thrown in for comments, and a gaggle of chatty girlfriends who make the situation seem palatable.  But 'IT'S COMPLICATED' works on one level: Meryl Streep takes on yet another role that challenges her to step into a character and make her credible and as usual she is a delight to watch.  She is aided by Alec Baldwin as her ex-husband/lover and Steve Martin as a wannabe boyfriend.  Streep's peppery gaggle of girlfriends have most of the entertaining chatter - especially fine work from Rita Wilson, Mary Kay Place, and Nora Dunn.  But in the end the plot seems to waste good  talent. Nancy Meyers may be doing the Feminist Movement more harm than good.  Grady Harp, April 10",1272412800,3,1315,4.561702127659575

Not exactly an unusual or complicated thing, you might say. What makes things complicated is Jake has already remarried, and nice and gentle Adam (Steve Martin) is romantically attracted to Jane.

For those who have seen Nancy Meyers' films - ""The Parent Trap,"" ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""The Holiday"" - her latest comedy drama is nothing surprising. Her films always begin with an interesting premise while the storyline itself remains rather straightforward and we can sense where the story is going. In fact, the plotline itself is not very complicated.

One thing is promised in her films: impressive cast that never disappoints. The actors are all having fun and it is great to see them having a good time. It is nice to see Steve Martin doing something different; it is also nice to see Alec Baldwin doing ""American Pie""-like silly joke. As for Meryl Streep, well, she is always great. Among the younger actors John Krasinski is really funny as very likeable Harley, who witnesses the ""affair"" of Jake and Jane. This is some feat, considering the stars he is with.

In short, Nancy Meyers plays it safe. That is not a bad thing.

In IT'S COMPLICATED, Jane and Jack have been divorced for 10 years now, and they have finally come to a sort of workable truce.  They have three nearly grown kids together.  Jane has a very successful restaurant, and Jake is happily married to the younger woman with whom he cheated.  Or is he?  Unacustomed time alone together at their youngest son's college graduation leads to an unexpected night in bed together.  This one-night-stand blossoms into a full blown affair, which leaves Jane, Jake, and the entire audience wondering if old wounds can be healed and old love rekindled.

While the plot of IT'S COMPLICATED really isn't (it's really pretty formulaic), the acting is truly magnificant.  Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin imbue their characters with life; they truly jump off the screen.  Meryl Streep is luminous - funny, warm, gorgeous, sentimental, sympathetic, sensual, and sexy as all get out.  Wow, Meryl, please keep proving that life does not end at 40 and that Hollywood is not just for starlets.  Alec Baldwin is excellent as Jake - a confused, aging little boy who wants whatever it is that he doesn't have.  A near perfect role for Alec Baldwin.  And Steve Martin as Adam, Jane's hope-to-be boyfriend, gives one of his best performances in years.  The three of them have superb chemistry, and that alone makes this a 5 star film.  The supporting cast are equally up to the task, and add depth and nuance to this film.

Its Complicated takes advantage of what much of what is most endearing and funny about people who have been through child raising, marriage and career building--their genuine surprise when they fall in love.  Meryl Streep plays a divorced woman with grown children who really doesn't expect to fall in love again and finds that she suddenly has two men after her.  If she were 35, this would be typical romantic comedy nonsense but Streep's character is in her 50s, so its believable when she says she doesn't expect to have her ex running after her.  Alec Baldwin plays the ex whose amazed to find that his beautiful second wife is not nearly so interesting as his first one.  Is this credible?  Of course.  His first wife is Meryl Streep.

And then there is adorable Steve Martin, the guy who is smart enough to tell Streep that her age is one of the things he likes most about her.  Is he kidding?  No, the way the two share jokes about the 60s and 70s, it makes complete sense.

Everyone in the theatre I saw it with was laughing out loud and having a great time. Number Two -- intelligently written, no mediocrity here. Number Three -- it's about real people who are grown-ups (well, maybe Alex Baldwin's character has got a ways to go), people with lives, children, and friends. Number Four -- it has a good spirit. So many of what passes as comedy today is nothing but nasty or stupid. That's not what's happening here. It's Complicated manages to be generous and wise about human nature without being mushy.

But luckily for the film, it didn't have weak leads and instead of being a bad movie, it was a decent one.  It is, I think, getting more attention than it deserves, based partly on the leads, partly on the conceit of a part of exes in their fifties having an affair years after their divorcce, and partly on Alec Baldwin's rolly-polly nude scene (which was funny).  But this awards movie season has, I confess, left me a tad depressed, with films like this and UP IN THE AIR receiving awards attention that they never should have received.  Luckily this film did not get an Oscar nomination (nor did it deserve one), though it did receive a Golden Globe nom.

This is definitely a film worth seeing with low expectations.  Approached with the correct attitude it will provide loads of fun, though I doubt if anyone will remember any part of it for more than a couple of days.

4086028,5,B0038JE376,"Although this has been billed almost solely as a comedy, this film has some very serious moments.  It is very funny in parts and overall I really enjoyed it.  Be warned though, there are some moments for the romantics in the audience that may not go over.  The stand out performance was Baldwin's as he had to do most of the laugh out loud funny stuff.  Then in a rapid about face, he had to get deadly serious.  I thought it was one of his very best film roles.  No one really knew he was a comic actor before 30 ROCK but he sure is.  There is one scene where he is posing in front of an Apple laptop in the nude without knowing that it is linked to Streep's new boyfriend, Martin, as they were having a video call with one another before she went to the bathroom. This is utterly hilarious.  His giving a sperm sample at the fertility clinic is pretty good too.  Streep was very good, as always, but I can't say she was as funny as Baldwin.  However, she was an excellent foil for him. Plus it is a boon for women that a plus 60 actress got to play this role.  Martin is really in a very small role here.  His funniest moment is when he listening to a divorce self help tape in his car and then we find out he's been divorced over 3 years!  He really plays a nerd most of the time though, a very nice nerd but certainly not the hilarious guy we know he can be, or the deadly serious one either.  As a comedy duo, Baldwin and Streep remind me a bit of Fey and Baldwin on 30 Rock.  They are a good comedic duo and I wouldn't mind seeing them make another movie, sort of like Doris & Rock.

4086030,4,B0038JE376,"In ""It's Complicated,"" director Nancy Meyers accomplishes what she did in her earlier film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Something-s-Gotta-Give/dp/B0001AVZA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Something's Gotta Give</a>""; she creates a great female character who is over fifty-five, succeeds financially in the world without a man and still has the potential and desire to not only have a fantasy romance, but to do so with gusto.  Unlike other `Ms.' magazine-reading cronies of her generation, Meyers' Jane Adler (Meryl Streep) character is not afraid to admit that she is lonely and that she feels badly when she sees couples trysting in hotels together or her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) married to a much younger hard-body executive (Lake Bell.)  However, as an experienced woman that can hold her own, she's got a few tricks up her sleeve proving that as we age our windows don't get narrower, they get wider if we just allow them to open. ""It's Complicated"" may rely on some clichs, but it's a feel-good film that keeps the audience laughing with its well-timed jokes honed by masters like Streep, Baldwin and Steve Martin and showcased against the backdrop of wealth so casually presented it seems de rigueur for this age group.

As she does in ""Something's Gotta Give,"" Meyers plays her comedy of manners 2010-style setting her heroine as the coveted jewel beside not one but two male protagonists.  Stereotypes abound, but Meyers debunks them quickly with some nifty reverse psychology that definitely runs against the current current.  Despite post-menopausal urgings from her chic girl posse, Streep's Jane is not in the market for a man, nor does she seem to be the diva collector a la those&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Giftset/dp/B0011UBDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)</a>&nbsp;gals who hunt either men or shoes.  Like Keaton's Erica in Something's Gotta Give, Jane possesses a savvy wisdom. Streep makes what she does for a living look simple; both characters' clothing and homes provide the perfect backdrop to studied elegance and ease that Meyers obviously feels should be owned by women in this part of their lives.

Although the men in this piece are not to be overlooked by any means, they are served as vegetables to further enhance the flavor of Streep as the full-bodied main dish.  Baldwin reeks with the smarmy superiority of the know-it-all male in the throes of his second family with all the traipsings of his overblown vanity--the escapist's black Porsche, buns of steel trophy wife sporting designer sunglasses, matching cell phone and curly-topped over-indulged 5-year old stepson. Meyers' enjoys giving her viewers a long and too lingering look at Baldwin's hirsute watermelon gut that allows women in the audience to indulge in a little ""ha-ha"" at the expense of men who suddenly are being looked at with the same microscope that have forced females of a certain age into the plastic surgeon's office.  In another scene, Streep critiques the fuddy-duddy wardrobe of nerdy architect Adam, played with a stifled `please,-don't-reject-me discomfort by Steve Martin who should be a man about town with his great job and checking account.  In Meyers' fairytales, her women have it going on from the start; the men figure out what their wise women are about and what they know as the story unfolds.  From the start it is a man's world, but as the tables turn, Meyers' men realize their folly and cannot fail to admire what they should have been admiring from the get-go.

This particular story lasts for just under two hours.  There are a few slow moments--but they are realistic ones where the character is allowed some time for a softly melodic introspection.  Streep's film family may be a little too picture perfect--their outfits match the studied home dcor, but I believe this to be deliberate--their charming insouciance adds poignancy to the sadness the Adler divorce has wrought.  The jaw-dropping surprise on their cherubic faces punches up the gotcha line in the non-stop jokes to a contagious guffaw volume.  Meyers does the over 50s rom-com proud--""It's Complicated"" entertains with the veneer of affluence that underlines that beyond the so-called `good lives' of designer bakeries, houses in the hills or in the Hamptons, expensive cars and dream kitchens, we need validation for what we are and what we have chosen as we are nothing and enjoy nothing without having loving witnesses.

Perhaps Meyers sets this film up as a cautionary tale for all those younger women out there who think they know more than an experienced woman. Maybe she's just looking for a little payback depending on her own circumstances.  Given this is a fiction, but nonetheless, I found Lake Bell's incredulous face while watching her older husband dance with his former same age wife enlightening.  Sometimes it takes more than a hard body and an iPhone App mentality; whatever your age the message is you have to work to keep what you've got and not take it for granted.

Bottom line?  ""It's Complicated"" delights its audience with what one has come to expect from a Nancy Meyers' directed film.  With its strong 50s something woman lead, living in a stylized world where the character's good taste and high paying career lends a polished too perfect sanitized film-esque unreality to the reality, the film explores what would happen if suddenly a supposedly, `finished with each other' divorced couple fell in lust for each other.  Non-stop laughing ensues as Meyers charms you with the talented Meryl Streep and her bungling boyfriends of a certain age proving that as we age, our windows don't narrow; they get wider and funnier. Highly recommended especially if you liked ""Something's Gotta Give.""

4086031,3,B0038JE376,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot; unfortunately, I did not. With three very talented people, one of whom I consider the best living American actress, in the lead roles, it should have been the best romantic comedy in years since all three performers are usually terrifically funny actors. Meryl Streep (Jane), Alec Baldwin (Jake), and Steve Martin (Adam) most of the time appeared to be just playing themselves. I believe I have seen every film that Meryl Streep has made, and I found this one to be my least favorites although I could watch her reading a grocery list. I would have preferred to see more of Steve Martin and less of Alec Baldwin, a lot less, as he is too old and too large these days to remove his clothes in a movie.

The movie certainly has its moments-- the scene with Streep and Martin getting stoned, for instance; and certainly Ms. Streep is worth seeing in anything. I suppose I just kept seeing her as Julia Child or a troubled nun, which is probably not fair to her.

""It's Complicated"" is not a bad movie; it is just not a very good one.",1263168000,4,1072,4.409090909090909
4086032,5,B0038JE376,"In her latest highly entertaining romantic farce ""It's Complicated"", Meryl Streep continues to astound. Moreso than and other actress (or actor) Streep is a chameleon, who takes on new totally different roles and completely inhabits the characters without leaving any traces of herself. It astounds this reviewer to think this was the same actress who portrayed chef Julia Child in ""Julie and Julia"" and a very strict nun in ""Doubt"" within the last two years! And she was totally convincing, and gave Oscar worthy performances in all three roles!

Whenever we see actors drunk (or high) on the screen we must realize they are not. They are stone cold sober or they couldn't act, which makes her many intoxicated scenes all the more funny and marvelous.

Meryl and costar Alec Baldwin look heavier, older and more middleaged here then I have ever seen them , which lends credibility to their roles. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress who just played the severe, thin nun. John Krasinski is also funny in support role as questioning in-law. Steve Martin, as is said elsewhere, is NOT over-the-top in his understated role as shy boyfiend.

There is a very funny scene with a computer with video. Alec Baldwin is hilarious playing an over-the-top role a bit similar to 30 Rock but with a lot more comedy and romance. He knows what he wants and doesn't want to take no for an answer, Streep is unsure. Meryl, as Jane, realizes she ""may be a bit of a sl*t"".

It occurs to me, in retrospect, that this movie is probably a revenge fantasy by a older woman whose husband divorced her and married a younger wife.

Very funny. Very human.
Highly recommended.",1262822400,63,1664,4.724137931034483

4086034,5,B0038JE376,"I saw this film in a packed theater on New Years Day, and the women in the theater literally howled with side-splitting laughter throughout the film. I was one of them! I though Nancy Meyers deftly acted come-drama about the complexities in a post-divorce family was spot on in every way: the lingering feelings of one former spouse for the other, the tendency to forget the issues that led to the divorce in the first place, the gradual dawning of awareness that those issues will inevitably rise again, the secret longing of now-adult children for the emotional charge between their parents (positive and negative) to finally end. All this, done with humor, pathos and a light hand. John Kasinski's portrayal of the conflicted about-to-be son-in-law could not have been better. Put him in for a best supporting actor nomination!

There was also something in this film that, in my opinion, generated the true source of laughter in the women in the theater. All of us have, at one time or another, met and loved a ""Jake"" in all his various guises: charming, funny, endearing...and as we eventually find out, NARCISSISTIC! From his place in the film, everything is all about him and his relentless pursuit of what he wants when he wants it. No matter the impact on the kids, the former wife and her hard-won emancipation from the drama and chaos narcissistic men (and women, to be perfectly fair) create in the lives of everyone who loves them. First comes the charm, the flirtation, the seduction, then the lies, followed by more of the same until it finally becomes clear that he's really and truly unaware of those upon whom he wreaks his chaos. The scene in which Agness Adler (Lake Bell), not the most appealing of characters, watches her husband longing after his former wife is a heart-breaker for all women who've ever found themselves in such a position. As is the scene in which Jane (Meryl Streep) finds all of her children huddled in bed and has to explain the tempest that just blew through all of their lives (and hers).

It's never Jake (Alec Baldwin) there to pick up the pieces. He's too busy chowing down on something scrumptious Jane just baked for the family or eating the last of ""the noodle dish"" without asking if anyone else wanted some. What Meyers does so beautifully is show the damage done to the hearts of people in relationship with self-absorbed partners. By wrapping this in humor, she makes it evident, but bearable to look into this particular mirror and see one's own life reflected back.

...which is why I think the women in the theater howled with laughter. They could relate to it all, to how easy it is to be sucked back into the vortex of the narcissistic suitor (who does this character better than Alec Baldwin?), to be courted by such intensity, to be awakened by the appeal of the flirtation in all its rightness or wrongness, and to ultimately come to realize that nothing much has changed in the person whose world revolves around his (or her) own needs. And why I think the men in the theater, including the narcissistic man in my life (still a friend, no longer a partner), just didn't get it. Oh, they thought it was a good enough movie, quickly forgotten, and completely missed the underlying (albeit delightfully humorous) personal and family dynamic.

That brings me to applause for Steve Martin and his quiet, slightly nerdy characterization of a man who isn't riding in his own orbit, but is actually open to getting to know an intelligent, accomplished, attractive older woman with a few well-earned lines and sags. Martin sometimes overacts his parts, but not in this film. He's the guy women overlook in the quest for a mate (a truth we don't admit easily), but in the end, it's his kindness, his ability to stand his ground without pulling everyone else onto an emotional roller coaster, his just plain SHOWING UP when he says he'll show up, that women who've been through the ringer with It's-All-About-Me men find so refreshing. Plus, the scene in which Adam (Martin) and Jane (Streep) get high at her son's graduation party is quite simply hysterical.

Hats off too to the actors who played the Adler children, starting into their adulthood (graduation, new job, marriage) with the post-divorce confusion still hanging over them. My own adult children can relate.

I absolutely loved this film. If I could have given it six stars, I would have, not because it was such a stand-out film with special effects...but because it was so real, and dear, and true to life...as the women in the theater obviously understood. It's right up there with ""Calendar Girls"" as a well-done comedic portrayal of women's gloriously messy-but-genuine attempts to find relationship with the right partners for the right reasons.

4086036,4,B0038JE376,"Jane (Streep) and Jake (Baldwin) have been divorced for ten years now.  He cheated on her with a younger woman, who he married.  Jane continued her role as mother to their three children as well as owning a very successful, and might I add visually tempting, restaurant.

A chance encounter for their youngest son's college graduation has the couple back in the sack again.  Jane's feeling pretty empowered cheating on the woman who broke up her marriage--after all, she's not an adulteress if she had Jake first.  And Jake, who is feeling pretty old and tired dealing with fertility treatments and a son who is old enough to be his grandson, is falling back in love with Wife Number One.

Enter Adam (Martin) the architect for the new addition to Jane's lovely home and you've got a love triangle building.  Add to that son-in-law to be Harley (Krasinski) and you've got an ensemble cast that's taking Nancy Meyers's hilarious lines and turning them into a visual treat as well.  Probably the funniest performance in the whole film is actually Harley, who discovers the affair and tries to keep it secret from his wife-to-be.

Overall, the music, scenery, and acting is very well done.  For so much attention to detail, I was somewhat disappointed to see the boom mic in several scenes; however, its appearance oddly only added to my amusement at the whole film.  If you're needing a break from the holiday madness, this is definitely a film to see.

4086037,3,B0038JE376,"IT'S COMPLICATED is an amiable mess of a movie, coasting on our good feelings about the actors who are in it, rather than truly creating characters we care about.  It's packed full of annoying clichs, and although relatively short, it feels too long.

Meryl Streep has been divorced from Alec Baldwin for about 10 years.  She lives near the California coast in a house that would cost about $10,000,000...but she's got an architect (Steve Martin) designing an enormous addition for her, so she can have her ""dream kitchen"" and ""dream bedroom,"" even though what she has now would make most of us drool.  She is apparently paying for this due to the success of a BAKERY that she runs, because apparently, this is the year for Meryl Streep to play women who succeed with cooking (see JULIE AND JULIA).

Baldwin, her ex, is married to a far younger woman (Lake Bell), who has brought to their marriage a young child from a fling she engaged in when she was temporarily split from Baldwin.  She also wants another child, and Baldwin (correctly, in my opinion) is not thrilled with the idea of being a father again at age roughly 58.

Streep and Baldwin take a trip to NYC with their kids to celebrate the graduation of their son (Hunter Parrish, from WEEDS, in a totally unconvincing performance) from college.  While there,  they have dinner and drinks together in the hotel restaurant, get sloppy drunk and have amazing sex in her room.  This blossoms into an ""affair"" between the two...Streep clearly is enjoying being a bit naughty, but Baldwin becomes clingy and is convinced that the two of them are meant to be together again.  The two performers do generate some fun chemistry, and for much of the film, we actually root for Baldwin to win his argument.

However, things become more ""complicated"" when Streep begins a new relationship with  her architect.  Steve Martin's character is kind and considerate where Baldwin's is boorish and passionate.  He's tender and affectionate, where Baldwin is much more forward.  Eventually, you begin to root for THAT relationship to succeed.  Naturally, there are MORE complications as the two men become wary of each other...and meanwhile Streep can't decide what she wants for certain.

The behaviors of the characters, when distanced from the actors, seem quite self-centered, and Baldwin in particular is foolish.  He's made mistakes, but thinks he can charm himself back into everyone's good graces.  Frankly, if less likeable actors had played these roles, we'd find Streep ridiculously dithering, Baldwin merely sleazy and Martin whimpy.  (Oh, and we've also got THE OFFICE's John Krazinski playing a version of Jim from that show, as the future son-in-law who sees what's going on.  The result of his performance is, ""Oh, isn't it cute to see Jim appearing in this movie.""  It's not really a character and not really a performance.  We laugh, because he feels like Jim.)

As I said, clichs abound.  Streep has a group of three understanding friends who come over to her house for wine and laugh a lot and support all she does.  I'm tired of this clich, particularly when two of the actresses are Rita  Wilson (who is just shrill in this role) and Alexandra Wentworth (who is a cipher in the film...not even a recognizable stereotype).  The wonderful Mary Kay Place is given nothing to do as the third friend...please, someone, give this actress a real role!  Some of the film's biggest laughs (and they are pretty big, I admit with guilt) come after several characters smoke pot.  Wow, a movie that has us laugh at how silly people act after smoking pot!!  Also, the movie shows us two very well-off people, but one is rich from a bakery and the other (Baldwin) is a partner in a law firm, but apparently he never actually has to go there.  He's always free to gallivant around.  At least we see Steve Martin working on occasion.  I get a bit weary of movies with people who all wear the best clothes, have gorgeous homes in spectacular locations, don't have to work hard, have loads of kids who are all intelligent, well-adjusted and live in homes they apparently do nothing to pay for, etc. etc.  Only these sorts of people can AFFORD to have the ""complicated"" problems they do.

I'm as happy to have a pleasant diversion from ""real life"" as the next movie-goer, but can't writers come up with something that feels fresh and original?  I like Streep, Baldwin, Martin & Krazinski...but this movie really allows them all to coast on their charm and past accomplishments.  I appreciate the film because it shows older folks being heavily involved in passionate affairs and having strong libidos.  I did laugh a fair amount at the silliness as it was going on...but I also inwardly groaned a lot as one easy clich after another was trotted out.
