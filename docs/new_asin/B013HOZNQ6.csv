7365063,5,B013HOZNQ6,"This was an excellent documentary.  The negative review is perplexing to me, the program was very well balanced. It's obviously meant to be viewed by the general public, so someone very knowlegable about the subject matter may find it too basic and there's much more to be learned, but its a great start.",1454198400,,304,4.735849056603773
7365064,2,B013HOZNQ6,"This is a sensationalistic documentary edited to  induce hysterical fear of clean nuclear energy, with many outright lies and unscientific data. It is a  propaganda presentation overall. Several very brief attempts to balance the presentation were quickly nullified by following scary comments. This narration ignores the amazingly good safety record of inexpensive and clean nuclear electricity production over many decades and greatly exaggerates harm done by a few minor accidents. The narrator says he is a physicist, but his comments say little for the quality of his education. The public at large is so poorly educated in these sciences, that they are easy to mislead with hysteria and fear. This bias seems to stem from a small army of ""health physics"" professionals who have been taught and whose livelihoods rely on the false hypothesis that all levels of ionizing radiation are dangerous,--totally ignoring the hormetic benefits of low dose exposure, and also ignoring the enormous quality of life benefits possible from virtually unlimited electrical power globally. Instead, I  highly recommended another much more balanced documentary, ""Pandora's Promise.."" be watched instead.",1449619200,7,1191,5.605555555555555

7365066,4,B013HOZNQ6,I thought it was very informative and well done.,1446681600,,48,4.444444444444445
7365067,5,B013HOZNQ6,"Excellent travelogue covering uranium.  He visits important world sites of discoveries, tests, and accidents.  One error is showing Trinity and not mentioning why PLUTONIUM, the alternative man-made fuel, had to be tested instead of uranium.  It was like the narrative did not have time to explain that splitting of the war effort to two states.  Not a huge fault.  The main thrust is correct.  A very controversial assertion is that only a few cleanup workers died after Chernobyl, and radiation is NOT dangerous at low levels but may actually be what has driven evolution on Earth.  Other people say thousands will die from nuke accidents.  It has recently come to light that elephants do not get cancer because they have many repair genes where humans have only a couple. Muller is very optimistic, and he exposes himself to lots of radiation on his visits.  We will have to wait and see if he succumbs to lukemia or other cancer in years to come.  The DVD ends with showing interview with woman scientist who proposes a safer nuclear power plant design.  Hope it works.  Nuke plants are having great trouble with cost overruns and environmental ups and downs against natural gas.",1445385600,10,1183,4.86
7365071,4,B013HOZNQ6,"Since the subject was plutonium, the video covered the subject.  However, not enough of the actual element;its chemistry and metallurgy were covered.  Being a Chemist, I was more interested in those characteristics than its effects on people and the environment.",1494115200,,262,5.525
7365072,5,B013HOZNQ6,"Loved this very engaging program wanted to add to collection and looking for the second part.
Even if you don't think this could possibly be of interest you are in for a keeper and will be looking for more.",1492992000,,206,4.3076923076923075

7365080,5,B013HOZNQ6,"I watched it first on PBS and loved it so I purchased it. I'm sharing it with friends. It is an outstanding presentation of the material. I wish I would have had this when I was struggling with the periodic table of elements when I was in high school in the '60s. Now it makes sense as he illustrates the many daughters, as uranium changes finally ending in the barren daughter, lead.",1485302400,,384,4.347222222222222
7365090,5,B013HOZNQ6,I am a chemistry teacher and it is so hard to find interesting and entertaining videos.  I LOVE this video!  It is one of the most impactful videos I have ever shown and the kids LOVED it.  They begged to see the second part (they usually hate videos).  The journey of our relationship with Uranium is amazing and you must see this video.,1485216000,,338,4.317460317460317
7365091,5,B013HOZNQ6,Good understanding about Uranium,1483574400,,32,7.25
7365092,5,B013HOZNQ6,This movie is a good way getting learn the about the misunderstood element that is uranium. It's doesn't dive super deep into the history or use of it but it won't lose you in complicated topics.,1479081600,,195,4.444444444444445
7365093,5,B013HOZNQ6,"Watched only the first half so far, but it was fantastic!  Good science told in engaging way.  As we debate nuclear energy and nuclear weapons - do we really want South Korea and Japan to have such weapons? - this movie gives a lot of information that can help anyone but the expert make sense of the field. Will be showing it to my college students for movie night when we study nuclear energy.",1477180800,,395,4.324324324324325
7365094,3,B013HOZNQ6,"This film has some very good information and the faults I have with it could also be actually helpful to other film makers.  The main being how not to narrate a documentary.  Dr. Muller, with his ""cutesy"" youthfulness, extreme personal grooming, polo shirts, ever present man bag, and over use of dramatics just didn't work for me.  He seemed full of himself, and if I heard one more reference to ""the dragons tail"" I would have had to shut the program off.  There were too many ""dramatic"" statements followed by Muller turning and looking off or walking off into the distance.  Amateurish theatrics  at best -  Dr. Muller just doesn't have the stage craft of Timothy Ferris or Brian Greene.  But he did bring some cool, new information that I haven't seen put forth before.  Worthwhile watching if you can stomach observing his impeccably trimmed beard and haircut for two hours.",1473984000,6,880,4.774834437086093
7365095,5,B013HOZNQ6,"I caught some of this show on a PBS station earlier and was so interested that I wanted to see the rest of it. Very well presented and thought provoking! The host presents enough science to help you to understand what he is talking about without overwhelming you, and he mixes it with visits to a number of locations to further illustrate some of the problems inherent in using nuclear power.
 I'm sure I'll be watching this again soon.",1466553600,,436,4.518987341772152

7365098,5,B013HOZNQ6,"It was like a comprehensive review of atomic theory. My students loved it! I highly recommend that it be used as complement to the book the Making of the Atomic Bomb, by Richard Rhodes.",1457654400,,185,4.470588235294118
7365099,5,B013HOZNQ6,I just enjoyed this video very much.,1457568000,,36,4.285714285714286
8727724,5,B013HOZNQ6,"Very interesting from start to finish, though his over-the-top 'happiness' was a bit disconcerting after a while. Ultimately, whether uranium is a blessing or a curse is up for you to decide.",1534982400,,191,5.0
8727725,5,B013HOZNQ6,"My favorite recent PBS science video. The host is very personable, he brings you into the story instead of making the subject boring!",1519084800,,133,4.826086956521739

8727728,5,B013HOZNQ6,It's very educational and intriguing. My interest was peaked throughout the presentation. The special effects were very good. They helped illustrate what the narrator was talking about. It made it easier to understand the subject matter.,1505174400,2,237,5.611111111111111
8727729,5,B013HOZNQ6,"An engaging, entertaining and informative documentary about the history and development of Uranium, Nuclear Energy, and the Atomic Bomb.

Dr Derek Muller is a great science communicator - I would regard him in the same league as Carl Sagan. He is also a brave man - one part of the documentary includes a visit to the wreckage of the Chernobyl reactor.

I personally enjoyed every minute of it.",1504569600,2,394,4.779411764705882
8727730,5,B013HOZNQ6,"Very interesting and shows Nuclear should be used more.  Cheaper, more consistent, longer lasting and less harmful to the atmosphere than wind or solar.  Wind and solar are good but have a larger carbon footprint during developing stages.  Nuclear is like flying rather than driving, safer percentage wise.",1501545600,4,306,5.333333333333333
8727731,5,B013HOZNQ6,"Very nicely done; the narrator is an Australian physicist with the unusual ability to explain the complex to the general population.  Similar to the late Carl Sagan, the narrator has a passion for science, coupled with a  magnetic personality, making this documentary entertaining rather than a work of study.  Would recommend.",1500163200,,327,5.372549019607843
8727732,5,B013HOZNQ6,Excellent documentary. Dr. Muller does a great job of presenting the material. Good primer on basic nuclear physics.,1498608000,,116,5.5
