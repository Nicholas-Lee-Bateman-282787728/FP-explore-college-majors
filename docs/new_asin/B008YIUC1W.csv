5190937,2,B008YIUC1W,"I was so excited to see this series. It had the potential to be an amazing story, covering an amazing period of our history that is rarely covered. From the first few minutes this series fell short. The story lines were shallow, predictable and wholly uninteresting. Same ole, same ole trash. Not one storyline was unique and common sense was nowhere in sight. I continued to watch, hoping it would redeem itself but it never did. Very disappointing. Save your money and choose another series or if you need to see it like I did, rent it. It is a waste of money and time and I love these types of series. Sad.",1390262400,2,609,4.398230088495575
5190938,4,B008YIUC1W,"I bought this video for my husband for Christmas. We sat down and watched the entire season while he was on Christmas vacation. I thought the characters were pretty well thought out. I think you will find that they do a great job of giving you the feeling you are in 1940-41. The women wear their hair and make-up just like you see in all the pin-up girls of that era. They delve into the man chauvinism that was pervasive during the 20th century. Men make sure that women know they are only working in the bomb factory until the men get home from the war. The movie delves into each woman's background a bit; letting you know how a rich girl, whose brother died earlier in a car accident, is not worth anything if she cannot marry well and give her father an heir. How another is working in the factory to support her and her husband, who was disabled in ""the great war"", while her 2 boys are off in this war. Another has run away from home because of a terribly strict reverend father, while yet, another is a natural blonde and loves showing off her ""assets"". The movie speaks to the fact that Canada, which is where this story is located, was in the war before the USA. And also the dangers of working in a bomb factory. How the ingredients to make the bombs changes your skin and hair color. It is a honest account of what the Canadian equivalent of ""Rosie the Riveter"" dealt with on a daily basis. Be sure that if you are from the USA, you MUST BUY REGION 1. Why I say this, evidently there are differences in how DVD players work in other countries. Thus far, Season 1 is the ONLY season available to the USA. I would presume that the company making these would eventually produce and sell Season 2. As of December 30, 2013, they still have not made it available to the US public. This story was good on so many fronts. If you are researching that era, WWII, or just like Meg Tilly, this is a good series. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was slow in places, otherwise it was satisfying. I think Siskel and Ebert would have given it 2 thumbs up [if they were alive to see it].  For now, the balcony is closed.",1389139200,12,2122,4.239506172839506
5190939,4,B008YIUC1W,"I enjoyed the series because I did not know much of anything about Canadian female factory workers especially in a bomb factory's enviroment.  However, as the series progressed, so did the progressiveness containing adultery, promoting lesbianism, lots of greed for good measure and mocking strict religious fundamentalists.  It is probably a true representation of the times but as the series continued, the subjects above seemed to grow out of porportion.  I was surprised to see the series cancelled, however I will not purchase Series 2 if it comes out.",1384992000,,557,5.235955056179775
5190940,5,B008YIUC1W,"GREAT SHOW VERY POWERFUL!!!!!! This is such a great show. It is important that women and young women watch this. It takes you on a journey-a real journey- of how women came together to run this country,work men's job while they were at war, and become independant. It shows us how we became independant from men. They made their own money, they worked, smoked, drank, dance, and stuck together. They held their heads high and were strong inside and out. I have heard they are not showing this in the states anymore or only online and this disapoint and upsets me very bad. I hate when Networks cancel great shows but, keep stupid, unimportant, and meaningless shows still on the air. Like Honey Boo Boo or Teen Mom, but nothing that uplifts girls and make them see how important they can be and skillful without being famous, vain, spoiled, everything that young girls think is important or normal. Get back to basics girls stop facebooking, over spending, and clueless to REAL LIFE not what you see on ""reality tv""",1382313600,2,1015,4.675977653631285
5190941,5,B008YIUC1W,I love the 40s so I was really excited to watch the series. It was a lot more believable than I'd thought it would be. The girls are fun and I love their different personalities. It was interesting to learn what life was like for women during the war. My only complaint is that the series was cancelled. :(,1380412800,22,306,4.203389830508475
5190942,4,B008YIUC1W,"Lots of stuff going on in this TV show based on the life of women during WWII, more specifically bomb girls, women who worked in a bomb factory. Season one consists of 6 episodes.

Glady's. Can't say I was overly fond of the star: a rich girl ""slumming"" it, in the beginning anyway. She thinks aiding the war effort consists of lifting her skirts for a total stranger of a solider in a dark alley. The first episode I wasn't impressed at all. She gradually begins to improve, but I sensed there may be trouble for her actions later down the road. By the end of the season, however, she was one of my favorite characters.

The rest of the cast:

Betty. She's the toughest bomb worker of them all and a lesbian in a world not ready for them. I felt her anger when she was misepresented in a movie.

Kate. A former preacher's daughter on the run with an obsession with singing. A HUGE disappointment in the end. HUGE.

Lorna. The ""crew chief"" who is married to a man crippled from the Great War and experiencing some frustrations because it. She loathes the Italian worker, Marco, with a passion, and for great reason. (I thought he was a dick, but my stepmum thinks he is hot. He's also one of those characters you like better in the end than the beginning. There are a few layers to him.)

Vera: Is distracted by the flirtatious Marco and gets her scalp torn off her head. As morbid as this sounds, her story is so far my favorite. I can't wait to see how she overcomes this  handicap of hers.

There's bad news received, deaths, fake letters, a thief, someone gets the clap, there's turning on one's friends, potential rapists... and lots of sexual harassment on the job. I love how the show shows how uncomfortable men's harassment can make women and the distraction leads to accidents. And of course, anytime something goes wrong, like a bad bomb, they blame the women.

As I said, not overly fond of the rich girl at first, but the rest of the women really sucked me into their lives and I found the factory bits though frustrating to watch at times as the men anger me, fascinating. I found myself watching them make the bombs instead of paying attention to their conversations at times.

I'm looking forward to more of this show.",1379289600,5,2234,4.453431372549019
5190943,5,B008YIUC1W,"Well, this one is a definite keeper. I don't think it is possible for me to love this show any more than I already do! World War II is my favorite era, and I have a whole kitchen decorated with ""Rosie the Riveter"" memorabilia so I nearly swooned when I saw this on Netflix. The characters are engaging and fun, and the show really highlights the sexist garbage women had to put up with in the workplace. (It's still not completely gone.) Meg Tilly gives an excellent performance and is the best character on the show, I think.",1375660800,12,526,4.377551020408164
5190944,5,B008YIUC1W,"It truly is a shame that after two seasons Global television decided to scrap this one and leave the fans with a television movie (airing 2014). For the first time we have a female cast that addresses gender issues, homosexuality, PTSD, pregnancy and abortion, and a plethora of things one experiences in a lifetime without being censored. No, this show is not afraid to go there and they tread not carefully, nor in a way that will leave you disappointed. Bomb Girls is a gem and does not exploit women. It gives us an insight into what it was like for women of various sexualities, races, and class differences, from many different job perspectives. Please watch this show! You will not be disappointed.",1374451200,44,705,4.739837398373984
5190945,3,B008YIUC1W,"Typical American 'can do'. It does stereotype women beautifully - they really do show that the female of the species was seen as fairly brainless and that only men could be in charge.
Worth watching.",1425340800,,199,4.714285714285714

5190947,5,B008YIUC1W,Absolutely loved it! Well rounded characters and amazing story. I wish the seasons had kept going the movie was horrible.,1420070400,,121,5.1
5190948,5,B008YIUC1W,"Except for one scene which, be warned, is NOT for the faint-hearted (I'm still reeling!), this show is a completely underrated and underappreciated gem. I'm so disappointed the show has been cancelled after only two seasons and a movie to sort of wrap things up - all of which offered intrigue, comedy and drama in spades. I wish there were more shows around like this - and that they'd last as long as some of the really, truly bad ones (always wonder why those seem to stick around much longer).

If you're interested in a good story without the unnecessarily crass, vulgar language or overdone special effects of so many other things on tv or in theaters these days, this show is not to be missed - give it a chance, it really is well worth watching!",1418342400,,753,4.4963503649635035

5190951,5,B008YIUC1W,"This is an amazing show with a great cast of characters. They deal with many social issues that face women, even today. For a change women are the main characters. It is a great pity there will be no more seasons!",1417305600,,213,4.219512195121951

5190953,5,B008YIUC1W,"How great to see an aspect of the war, that for the most part is overlooked in war movies, and by that I mean the bomb factories. This series is informative as well as entertaining. Both seasons of Bomb Girl bring new information about the factories and the women that work in them.

5190955,5,B008YIUC1W,"This is a great series that should have never been cancelled. My daughters and I loved it. I am a high school teacher.

5190957,5,B008YIUC1W,My grandmother worked for a munitions factory during WWII and retired in 1990 now I work for the same munitions factory. I love what I do. The white powder uniforms are all to familiar. No rings or metal hair pins or clips. Yellowing of the skin from the explosive. That is very real and the lives these women lead are familiar themselvs. The characters in this drama are experiencing everyday hardships. Some may think that the plots r far fetched but they arent. What i find far fetched is that these girls probably wouldnt all be envolved in the same entourage. They would be close don't doubt that because i see it in my own factory...a form of family like bond when the person next to u LITERALLY hold your life in their hand....but not the same circle. Wish they had a season 3.  And if anyone wonders why Gladys couldn't work when she cut her wrist on the morter shell...you cant work with explosive with open wounds.,1400803200,,924,4.5
5190958,4,B008YIUC1W,My Mother during ww2 worked for AO Smith loading bomb casings to be sent out for arming.

5190964,5,B008YIUC1W,"Not only was it entertaining but educational. How women were not to be considered as good as men and were mostly sex objects. Women were not considered smart or strong. How they had different classes to teach women how to manage their money. Shop wisely.

8532545,5,B008YIUC1W,"I love this series. It's set in Canada during WWII. All the characters are complicated & have numerous adventures in love, regarding the war, with women doing ""men's work."" The show is GLBT friendly with realistic women in love with each other. It delves into the darker aspects of life in Canada for minorities--the cruelties of a detention camp for Italians & how this affects the families.
Although people die, there is no gory violence. I am so sick of gory violence. So I love this show. Meg Tilley & all the other actors do a wonderful job. It's not a high budget series but everyone works hard to tell good stories. Hooray for this show. It should be brought back!!",1464912000,,672,4.56198347107438

8532549,3,B008YIUC1W,"Semi-interesting depiction of WWII women workers in Canada. I feel this show could have been so much more than it was - it's more of a soap opera style than historical depiction, as the 'feel' of the characters is modern, although the costumes are accurate.
