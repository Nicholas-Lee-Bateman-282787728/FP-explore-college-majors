8561277,5,6303296505,"This is a VHS tape, but the quality is surprisingly good.  The tape is exactly what it says - footage of Jung expressing and clarifying his views.  Very interesting and informative.  I believe Jung once said that he would rather be Jung than a Jungian.  Well, I would rather listen to Jung himself than to someone else trying to explain his works.  Wonderful!",1401840000,,359,4.634920634920635
