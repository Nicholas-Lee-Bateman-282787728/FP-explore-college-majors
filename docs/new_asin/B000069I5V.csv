I've seen the trailer for this movie and from what I've seen it'll be worth the money, I might even buy some popcorn and candy at the theatre. I don't go to the movie theatre that often, but I'm going to see this one, I suggest everyone else do the same. R.I.P. Aaliyah, I'll always be a your fan.",1013472000,4,471,4.119565217391305

I took two days off from work so I can go more than once. I don't care who is in it, I'm just a little sad that they didn't get Tom Cruse to be Lestat again. I am also glad they got Johnathan Davis to do the sound track, KoRn rocks. I don't think there is any way this movie could be bad.",1013212800,3,450,3.7473684210526317
1732782,5,B000069I5V,I have not seen the movie yet.  I am a big fan of Ann.  I just got the new book Blood and Gold for my B-Day recently and can't wait to read it also.  I have read all her books and have them on hard back and don't lend them out.  I can't tell you how excited i am to see the movie almost coming here to my city.  I am sure Aaliyah did a wonderful job in this movie yes she was very beatiful and talented she will be greatly missed.,1012867200,3,430,3.630434782608696

1732784,5,B000069I5V,"I have been waiting for this movie since before Aaliyah's death.  I know that there has been a lot of confusion over whether or not this film will come out because of its gruesome content, but I am am sure that everyone realizes that she was playing a role.  In the book (which is poorly written in my opinion, although it does make a great screenplay)Lakasha is an evil you-know-what whose main goal is to destroy everything on earth except Lestat.  I am looking forward to seeing Aaliyah play a role that was completly unlike her in real life. She is more than a woman, she is a legand.",1011657600,5,588,4.376146788990826

1732786,5,B000069I5V,"I've been a fan of Aaliyah's (Peace be upon her) since 1994 when she released ""Back n forth"" and have bought ALL her albums on the day of release and most singles.
When I heard last she was coming in a movie (Romeo must die) I went absolutely crazy and couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD, when I found out the release date I pre-ordered it 5 months in advance!
After about 6 months I read in a magazine she would be taking the lead role in Anne Rice's movie (Queen of the damned)I went mad again, then tradegy struck!  I'm still going to pre-order Queen of the damned when it gets a release date on DVD because there's no doubt it will be beyond fantastic!
Interview with the vampire was excellent and I'm sure this is going to be at the same level if not a little better.  It'll be the first movie I've ever seen with a lead role played by a female vampire!  I personally have great antcipation!
Aaliyah is excellent and anyone who doesn't think so need to check their heads out!  Her music is more dark and deep then anyone else her age, maybe the only other person now is Alicia Keys but she's going to have to keep up her work to gain a position as high as Aaliyah's!
Aaliyah (Peace be upon her)

I remembered watching this movie as a kid and I loved it, so I bought it a decade later.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The story/plot is OK but the actors (and their over the top accents) just don't bring it home.  Watching it now, the biggest take away I have is ""Wow, this movie was made in the '90's."".  Not that the special effects were sub-par, there has just been a dramatic shift about what's ""cool"".

1732874,1,B000069I5V,"This isn't just a terrible adaptation, this is a terrible movie. Period.

A decent adaptation means that you shouldn't have to have any prior knowledge of the source material going in to have even the faintest idea of what's going on. This film is not the case. Thank God I read the book, or I would have no idea what was going on. They try to cram so much into this movie without bothering to explain any of it. The only vampires that the movie bothers to name are Lestat, Marius, Akasha, and Maharet; the other vampires who show up at the climax aren't named and really don't speak. People who have never read the books would be left wondering who these people are and why they even bothered to show up. They speak about the ""great family"", how Jesse is part of it, how it's so important that they save it, but it's really just a line or two and the audience is supposed to understand how important this is. Even Maharet, who is set up as Akasha's nemesis is barely given any screen time. The audience has no idea why she and Akasha hate each other so much, just that they do. This movie is all tell and no show.

Let's not forget Akasha... Oh, boy. To be fair, I liked the idea that she was this blood-thirsty queen and now that she's awake again, she's going to slaughter humanity to feed her blood lust. (I found this a lot more entertaining--and less nauseating--than her wanting to kill off most of the male population to achieve world peace. Honestly, I spent the later half of the book wondering why a vampire queen should care about humanity, but I digress.) That being said, she really only comes into the movie in the last half hour. The movie's called Queen of the Damned, and the queen only shows up at the end. Furthermore, she's really not all that menacing. She sets some vampires on fire and slaughters most of the inhabitants of an island (off-screen) all while belly-dancing around, but that's about it. She's alluring, but I'm not really afraid of her.

The MTV/Goth wet dream vibe that is rampant throughout this film dates it in such a painful manner, and the vampire effects are so bad that they're hysterical. The whole film is just embarrassing really. The acting is cringe-worthy, but I think most of that has to do with the script. If you loved the book, skip it. If you're a fan of vampire movies, skip it. There's really nothing of merit for anyone.",1480118400,,2379,4.451834862385321

1732933,5,B000069I5V,"This stands on its own as a nice, entertaining vampire movie, although it does help to have read the original second and third novels from the Anne Rice series of the Vampire Chronicles. Some scenes will leave viewers wondering ""what the hey"" and ""who are those people"". The photography is lush, and the special effects have their parallels in many scenes in ""Interview with the Vampire"". About the music: Quite a good mix of historical and contemporary works. Enjoy!

Instead of giving you exactly what you already know, you are given a film that ties the poetry of the book into a mysterious, dark, sexy movie with a killer soundtrack. This movie could be a masterpiece solely on the music that intertwines to the feelings of Lestat. It's reminiscent to The Crow in many ways to me. A beautiful film, a beautiful soundtrack, and a beautiful story. Watch and enjoy, preferably with the surround sound on max!!!",1450137600,,544,4.7368421052631575

Ok, so there it was completely suckie. The scene where she (the Queen) starts to kill off the vampires in the tavern was cool. But you ask yourself why is she killing off everyone? Only one, maybe two ppl confronted her. Everyone else was scared and worshipped her. And if she was so powerful, how come she wasn't able to take everyone out in the end, before they started sucking on her? And if that guy was a god king, how did she kill him so easily? And how come when she died, she turned to ash, but the god king remained a statue? And how come LeStat... well, you get the picture. Waaaay, more ""this doesn't really make sense"" than enjoyable film and acting (was there really any good acting in this movie?).",1440115200,,876,4.251497005988024

Townsend made the perfect Lestat - second only to Tom Cruise. Aaliyah, bless her soul, was the spotless Akasha. The only real issue I had was that Jesse's character wasn't portrayed very well by that Might Ducks actress.

1733084,1,B000069I5V,"Queen of the Damned is a great book, and as it's too often the case, a horrible movie. They completely gutted the storyline of this wonderful work of fiction by Anne Rice, and the result bears little to no resemblance to the book's plot. The central story line was completely removed (including a major character),and replaced with a ridiculous love story that never occurred. The acting was mostly awful, though Townshend was passable. Casting was especially misguided, except in the choice of Claudia Black as Pandora, Matthew Newton as Armand (much closer to the description of Armand in the books than Antonio Banderas in Interview). On the flip side, Aalyiha was just terrible, but she's wasn't really an actor, so it's forgivable. Paul McGann, while an excellent actor and quite good in this, just isn't David Talbot, who was supposed to be a much more elderly British gentleman.

If you've read the book and loved it as I have, this film will be a bitter disappointment and nearly unrecognizable as the story you cherish. If you've never read it, it will be a passable B movie, something that wouldn't seem totally out of place on MST3K.

QotD was an ambitious story, and all the book couldn't be contained in a single movie without a 10 hour running time. But they didn't need to completely change the story and remove the central plot line in order to trim it. And (a personal pain point), they didn't need to kill characters who didn't die in the book.

Strongly NOT recommended. One star for at least having Armand look childlike and cherub like with auburn hair (as in the books), rather than a 40ish hispanic man with a goth Cher wig. Though I think Townshend could have done a better job in Interview with the Vampire as Lestat than Cruise,who was poorly cast but in a much better (and truer) movie.",1422489600,,1813,4.69496855345912
1733105,4,B000069I5V,"I'm seeing awful reviews about this movie, and I just wanted some people to see a review from someone who actually enjoyed the film. I don't like vampire movies, but I made an exception for this one. A LOT better than all of those others like twilight, etc. I didn't read the book, which I'm sure it is different. But what movie that is based on a novel, where everything is exactly the same. And I'm glad it's that way. A movie is an alternative from a book. Gives you a reason to watch it. If I expected to see a movie that was exactly like the book, I wouldn't see a point. And if you can't imagine the characters or setting from reading the book and you must watch the movie to so you could get every detail(which would be different anyway), then maybe it's not a good book. Watch the movie and appreciate it for what it is.",1422316800,,828,4.18125

1733108,4,B000069I5V,"The main plot is between Lestat, Jesse, and Akasha.  There are also several subplots involving David, Maharet, and Marius - each is connected to one or more of the main characters.

Akasha and her mate were the Original Vampires.  Vampires worshiped them as Gods - they were the source of all Vampirism.  To every Vampire they were the Creators.  After countless centuries of life they'd lost the will to carry on, they'd become Living Statues.  Marius had eventually become their caretaker.

At the beginning of the movie Lestat was intomed in a crypt. He too had lost the will to carry on. Eternity had become too much to handle, so he'd slept for several generations.  Eventually he sensed that society had shifted, he found a reason to rise.

He turned himself into a Rock Star, declaring to the whole planet that he was a Vampire.  Naturally society as a whole didn't take that seriously.  As a Rock Star he was worshiped by countless fans.  He also gained an endless supply of prey.  Fans came to him, not realizing their danger until it was too late.

Jessie was part of a secret society.  One that recorded Vampire Activity, but was sworn to never interfere.  David was her mentor, and a father figure.

David had been studying Marius for many years, unaware that Marius had been doing the same with him.  After the final battle Marius comes for David, presumably to turn him.

Through David Jessie gained access to Lestat's journal.  That journal told how Marius made Lestat a Vampire.  How Lestat had eventually found Akasha.  For the first time since Marius had cared for her, Akasha moved.  She offered him her wrist - her blood.  A tiny taste of her blood had made him quite powerful.

Jessie became obsessed with Lestat.  She found him in London, and followed him to his concert in Death Valley.  The chemistry between those two was beautiful.  She wanted to become a Vampire, she wanted to be with Lestat forever.  She was also connect to an ancient Vampiress - Maharet.

Maharet had been made by Akasha herself.  Before being turned Maharet had born a child.  Even as a Vampire she'd taken care of that child.  She'd followed each generation of her descendants.  As a child Jessie had believed Maharet was her aunt.  Near the end of the movie Jessie learned the full truth.

Lestat's music, boldness, and defiance had spread across the entire planet.  Eventually it was enough to wake Akasha.  She took the King's Blood, absorbed his power.  Then she came for Lestat, wanting him for her new King.  She and Lestat shared a night together.  Metaphorically feasting on each others flesh, and literally feeding on each others blood.  Akasha's blood gave Lestat the power to walk in daylight.

Maharet and Marius allied themselves with several other ancient vampires.  They were terrified of fighting Akasha.  It wasn't just that they weren't sure they could beat her.  They didn't know if the Vampire Species could survive without it's creator.

When Akasha arrived with Lestat they refused to join her.  She ordered Lestat to kill Jessie, to punish Marharet.  When Lestat demanded his crown, she didn't hesitate.  Akasha had believed Jessie's death would solidify her hold on Lestat, instead he'd broken it.

With her veins open, Akasha was vulnerable.  The ancients all attacked.  2 died in battle.  Then Marharet finished her.  Marharet took the last of Akasha's blood - she became a living statue, the New Queen of the Vampires.

Afterwards Lestat gave Jessie his blood.  The movie ends with the two of them heading off into eternity together.",1421539200,,3560,4.820598006644518

1733162,1,B000069I5V,"I remembered watching this movie on Cinema it was dismal. Being a fan of Anne Rice The Vampire Chronicles between 1995-97 as a Teenager, interview with the Vampire stars Brad Pitt really did Justice, Both Brad and Tom were not my type of Actors but they looked Angelic and seductive so beautiful and otherworldly, Kirsten Dunst before her Fame Debut as a self pitted woman Child immortal as years rolled by, will go down in history. That movie is unforgettable unlike some film nowadays.

Unfortunately Queen of the Damned is forgettable, and Camp. Stuart Townsend did not carry the movie as an EMO looking vampire. I loved Aaliyah but she is better at singing than Acting. One thing that I find frustrating is the ancient Historical inaccuracies, Akasha is suppose to be Sumarian from Uruk that later became an Ancient Egyptian Queen. Sumerians language is Turkic, modern day turks recognized over 300 words than any race could translate straight away. So Akasha is meant to be Oriental looking or native American, even The name Akasha is a Turkish word. I noticed for years our culture is being hijacked and later on stolen.
Even the Akasha's Husband King Enkil, is from the Sumerian God Enki whom we once worshipped 7000 years ago.
It was the Black Activists in America that started moaning about the Ancient Egyptian roles playing in Hollywood, without reading the Book, Akasha is Sumarian not African.
Now they are stealing Sumerian culture saying they are black..oh please! Do they understand ancient Turkish language from the cuneiform?No. But they are trying to take away the Olmec Indian of Mexico saying olmecs are black, now they saying they are the First Americans not the proto-mongolians since crossed over to the Ice age.

It is a movie of political incorrect fodder and self indulgence for lying thieves who are not proud of their own culture and want to hijack and steal other races ancient History. They won't ever be happy because down deep they know it is untrue, Sumer IS NOT their ancient History. They never worshipped Inanna and Enki, only Ogun, ayida wedo, Mawu-Lisa the true AFRICAN GODS and should be more appreciated and black activists should learn count their own blessings.

Hollywood should have used the same director, writer and the Cast: Tom Cruise reprise the Lestat role, and Cher should have played the Ancient Queen, at least she has Armenian and Turkish heritage mix, plus an Oscar winner, her magnetism and screen presence would have been captivating, along with her outstanding regal Beauty to be more suited as ""the Queen of Heaven"". It would have been a better movie and would surpassed interview with the vampire.

Instead Queen of the Damned is The worst movie ever, even Anne Rice hated it, if she hates it. Then I rest my case.",1416096000,,2775,4.872881355932203

The book is FILLED with scares and thrills and historical vampires at each other's throats (pun intended).

Is the movie bad?  No.  Actually, it is a very nicely done vampire movie.  Atmospheric and dark, mysterious and beautiful.  Great soundtrack.  But it is really its own creature.  Associating it with the book is kind of lame.

The BEST thing you can do to get an ultra-pleasing fill of vampires is see this movie AND read the book.  You might begin to see this film as a rough draft in the realm of ideas, while the novel is the finished masterpiece.

1733234,5,B000069I5V,"If you're a World of Darkness junkie, then this movie is for you, but you know that, because you've watched this. The music fits, Stuart Townsend nails it, and even Aaliyah does a good job, since her character is meant to be a bit off. Add in some excellent supporting work by Vincent Prez and Paul McGann and you've got a great movie. Marguerite Moreau isn't amazing, but she's adequate.

One must regard this not as a ""film"" in the truly artistic sense, but as a form of vampire porn, created for a very specific audience, intentionally or not. For that audience this movie is more or less perfect. And I happen to be one of them.

This is not as good as Interview with a Vampire, but one must view Interview as being of a slightly older period of film making. While that movie is very 20th century, this movie is very strongly 21st century. While Interview is all about Lestat's Southern Gothic phase and its aftermath, this movie is all about his movement into Gothic Punk. Indeed, were I to attach far too much meaning to this film, I might suggest that it contains an immensely deep message about the attractive qualities of modern cultural shifts (to the point of waking the eldest of vampires, while attracting vast swarms of others), and their gradual overwhelming of more traditional modes...

But then I might risk sounding like Lestat (or Marius, come to think of it; something about those paintings David was collecting).",1400284800,2,1434,4.660079051383399

Personally, I was not fond of Tom Cruise as Lestat in the first film (still loved the movie) but was quite impressed with Stuart Townsend's portrayal.  He played Lestat as a more more sexual  being and can draw you in with his sensuality. I found the music to be mesmerizing and I'm not normally one to follow that genre of music. A few big inaccuracies made me wince but I sat back and let it go and had a great time--enough to buy the. DVD and watch it again several times!",1397088000,,700,4.057971014492754

1733260,3,B000069I5V,"I've read the first three books of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. I also saw the ""Interview with the Vampire"" movie and thought it was pretty faithful to the book. If you are a fan of the ""Queen of the Damned"" novel, do not watch this movie, you will be let down, I assure you. Me? I'm more open minded to ""adaptions"" and don't judge it until I see it. This movie, even though it doesn't follow the novel that much at all, is still pretty good for what it is. If you changed the character's names and the movie title you would have a decent vampire flick. Honestly, I don't hate Tom Cruise, but he doesn't really capture the sexuality of Lestat, more the attitude. Stuart Townsend captured the sexuality and the mysteriousness of Lestat perfectly. Also, the music in this movie is pretty great, thanks to Jonathan Davis, who really made Lestat's rock/metal sound... vampirific, I guess would be the word. Another note: The acting wasn't that bad. As far as everything else goes, the plot was pretty butchered, back stories were changed, and there was almost no character development at all. Now that goes without saying, I'm not going to get rid of this movie, because it falls into my guilty pleasure movies, albeit if only for the music and Stuart Townsend's depiction of Lestat.",1396051200,,1313,4.663793103448276

The music soundtrack is superior if your into Goth and Hard Rock featuring Disturbed, Static X, Papa Roach, Dead Cell, Lincoln Park, etc.

1733326,4,B000069I5V,"Let me start by saying I never read the vampire chronicles. I have read Anne Rice's werewolf novels but that has nothing to do with this. I will also state I do not care for vampires or their stories that much. My favorite vampire movie is actually Nosefartu(hope I spelled that right). I have watched a lot of vampire movies however because I love horror. Onto the movie.
  This movie gets a lot of hate because it apparently leaves out A LOT of the two books it is based on. My sister read the books and told me everything that was missing but said she actually like this loose adaptation. I won't go into it here since I haven't read it but I do understand why fans of the books would hate this movie. That being said however, this movie is only a 100 minutes and a lot of stuff that is missing is details essential to understanding the plot and they even left out major characters and made Jesse into a romantic interest of Lestat. Apparently even Lestat looks wrong because he has blonde hair in the novel(Tom Cruise died his hair blonde for Interview With The Vampire which is the prequel), so a lot is being said about that. I say go into this movie knowing they basically pulled characters out of the Books, ignored Interview With The Vampire, and changed plot points. If you do that there is a lot to enjoy in this movie.
  First off I like how Lestat is portrayed in this movie. If I actually feel for a vampire that says something in itself. Basically he doesn't like having to hide from humans and see's himself as being alone. After sleeping for a hundred years he awakes to a rock band and he becomes their lead singer calling out all the vampires of the world to come out of hiding. This understandably pisses them off and sets up the basic plot. His music also raises Akhah(not spelt right) who is the mother of all Vampires. Their is your basic love interest between Lestat and Jesse who is human but wants to shock......be a vampire with Lestat. Pretty basic vampire story with a nice twist in Allayiah. The movie has a great soundtrack but the special effects are pretty bad. They use CG to make them look like their real fast but im a fan of all horror and know that comes with the turf.
  This is one of those movies I pretty much blew off when I first saw it but after deciding to watch it one night when I was bored I found it got better the more I watched it. The plot will be confusing but the basics are covered. Knowing why these vampires are fighting against the Queen Of the Damned would have been better with another 10 minutes of explanation but I can live without. People, it is just a vampire movie. It is not the greatest story ever told. It is a vampire that is actually likable and easy to relate to. I say forget Interview because that movie is completely different than this one. I'm sure they could have done a much better job with this movie but too me I enjoyed it. I recommend you give it at least two watches and forget the books and previous movie it is based on and just look at it as a stand alone B Horror Flick. If you do that is a great watch.",1393113600,,3092,4.2679180887372015

1733356,5,B000069I5V,"Vampire Lestat ( Stuart Townsend) takes a nap for a few hundred years because the 18th and 19th centuries were boring. Apparently life begins at a NIN concert. Lestat joins a band and somehow is instantly a success in an age before  Simon Cowell (must be a chapter they skipped from the book). He openly claims to be a vampire to the dismay of vampires in hiding and taunts them, ""Come out come out whoever you are."" It didn't take long for him to pick up the modern accents and slang.

There is a lot of loose talk of loneliness and ""the dark wasteland of eternity"" apparently a theme designed to appeal to the immortals among us, for some reason I failed to connect to it.

Our title character (Aaliyah ) makes her first real appearance about halfway into the film. Catchy title, but it really was all about him and not her.

The film is a modern erotic thriller without sex and nudity, something that most filmmakers can't accomplish.

Now what if ""Concrete Blond"" was composed of vampires and they had a battle of the bands...

I did not read the Anne Rice books, so I don't know how bad the adaptation was or wasn't.

I enjoyed the music in the film more than the acting. Stuart was great in his role and I am still scratching my head at Aaliyah's accent. Was that was supposed to be ancient Egyptian or something? Sounded more Akkadian.

This movie seems like the script was handed to Michael Rymer while he was on a coke binge, and he directed it based solely on the synopsis given to him by a Aaliyah's agent rather than actually reading the book.  I guess that we should be thankful...after this piece of trash, noone took Rymer seriously as a film director and he was forced to do television.  This led to him directing some of the best television in decades on the ""Battlestar Gallactica"" franchise and now on ""Hannibal"".  I guess every director is allowed at least one turd.

Aaliyah  is the Mother of all Vampire's and a Queen of Her right, but she is has power that is more then any Vampire has ever seen. She is so hot and seductive she reaches even through the screen at you. The one thing I like they have two fangs, not a row of nasty baby teeth and slanted eyes. They don't have home's from HGTV all bright instead they still keep that Mid evil Darkness, Or clothes from (Amber krombie and Finch) Or playing soft ball ooooohhhh so scary.

1733581,3,B000069I5V,"I get it; Lestat was one bored vampire at this point.  Stuart Townsend's weary drone highlights that boredom to the nth degree.  His many narrations drag out his world-weariness to the brink of endurance.  The problem with depicting boredom is that it tends to infiltrate every aspect of your film.  What can you do with a featured character who's bored?  For starters, don't hire a boring actor who plays the lifeless creature with stupefying numbness.  Loved the books, could barely tolerate this version of them.  At best, it bore an unreasonable facsimile to the events it threatened to betray with a lackluster presentation.  Where was the air of mystery, the intrigue, the sensual elements?  When the Queen finally presents herself, it's too little far too late.  She too, lacks the necessary menace.  There was absolutely nothing about these characters or the way they were presented that allowed me to become involved in their story.  Unremarkable.  Ordinary.  Less than fanciful, just another mundane reenactment of a superior book(s).  At most, it was just barely okay.",1381276800,,1079,5.120689655172414

1733583,3,B000069I5V,"You would think by the bad reviews, AR fans want to place a great big stake right in the heart of this movie. Just think about it, a move with no big names, no big name director, what do you expect? Pure cornball and that's what you get. I read AR when I was in high school and that was 20 years ago, I was not emotionally attached to the characters or plot because of the novels. The photography and costume of this film is impeccable. This is not a B movie. I never heard of Stewart Townsend until I watched this movie. Also the guy who plays Marius is a star in France but no name in the US. Plot: Lestat gets bored with his vampire life because he is tired of being an immortal, he causes havoc by telling vampire secrets in his songs and becomes a rock star. This pisses off the rest of the vampires and they want to kill him. There is a story line of Librarians and Old Vampires but it makes no sense. Another storyline is Akasha. I really loved the characters of Akasha and Lestat, they slither and float across the screen. Townsend rocks as Lestat, much better than over the top terrible actor Cruise. In the novels, Lestat is sexualized, bisexual, chaos with fangs, and insatiable. Townsend's Lestat exemplifies all these traits. He is more than just eye candy. Watch this movie for Townsend's performance. The story gets convoluted and the ending makes no sense, but it is fun to watch.

1733584,3,B000069I5V,"Although it is the sequel to Interview with the Vampire this is a very different beast to the first film. Nobody from the original is in this and it has a much younger, more goth music video feel to it. In a sense that's not necessarily a bad thing as I quite enjoyed the music in the film.

The story centres around Lestat who has woken after a century of slumber and decides to go public with who he really is. This angers the other vampires and makes him a target, meanwhile the queen of vampires has arisen and seeks to make Lestat her king.

It's a fun watch even though it does stray into romanticising vampires, although they do remain monsters. The music video feel keeps the pace quick and punchy. Unlike the first film it lacks quality, the cast do a reasonable job, but no-one really stands out, except for Marius, for some reason I enjoyed his character more than the others.

1733711,2,B000069I5V,"Queen of the dammned is a good example of what can happen to what could have been a promising series of films based on the Anne Rice vampire novels if its not done right. Rice her self was not very optomistic about the production of Interview with the vampire when she heard that Cruise and Pitt were going to play the leads in the film. She was pretty unhappy about it. But once she saw the movie she was thrilled and felt it paid a reasonable tribute to her book. After all, when is a movie every bit as great as the book? It rarely happens. So lets suffice to say she had no major complaints, And it could have meant even greater classic films based on her books to come. But after the release of this near miss no studio wanted to touch another book by Anne Rice about vampires. This movie seems to have cursed the possibility. And while this movie isn't really all that bad there are numerous moments that nearly ruin it. One is the concert scene in Death Valley which while having some interesting special effects makes the film feel pretty goofy. Theres more stupidity after that, and even before. I still found that there were some really decent moments, and I liked in particular the scene where Lestat is playing the violin on the beach. The moment was pretty great, as were various other moments. But the movie doesnt follow Rices work much at all and nearly makes a mockery of the entire event. And honestly I prefered Cruise over Stuart Townsend who seemed cheesy in the role. And it creeps me out to realize that this film was far better than the Twilight movies, so you can use your imagination to figure out what I thought of those.",1367625600,,1648,4.406557377049181

1733718,1,B000069I5V,"if you've never picked up any of the vampire chronicles you will probably like this movie. it's pretty and has pouty lips, flashy costumes and decent music.  but if you have actually read any of the books in the VC, you will HATE it like i did.  where was anne rice during all this?? did she have no say at all?  it looked like it was made by someone who heard a review of the book from someone who was drunk.

first of all, stuart townsend was no lestat.  he wasn't the worst they could have gone with.  to me, all he really had of lestat was the hair.  when i first heard tom cruise was going to play the part of lestat in ""interview with the vampire,"" i was dismayed.  i thought cruise was totally unsuitable for the role.  but then he surprised the hell out of me by nailing lestat's personality completely.  that is my favorite cruise movie.  brad pitt was wonderful as mopey louis, as well.

so much happened to lestat before ""interview with the vampire"" even took place.  and ""queen of the damned"" either tried to cram it all in one movie, or they decided, eh, screw it, it won't matter.

lestat did not have such an intimate relationship with jesse.  she was a very important part of the story, but their importance was miles apart from each other.  okay, i could live with marius being the one to make lestat, but the rest was infuriating to me.  ""queen of the damned"" is a great book.  a little lengthy in places - i'll admit there are parts i now know to pass over when i re-read it occasionally.  but the characters are vivid and the history rice weaves of how the very first vampires came to be was (imo) riveting.  the only other book i love as much or more is ""the vampire lestat,"" where we learn about lestat's journey.  really, ""interview with the vampire"" has little to do with the story as a whole.  that was just what happened to poor old louis.

what really motivated me to write this was the ending of ""queen of the damned."" NOTHING like the book.  i was appalled. they used some fancy (for the time) special effects, some brooding looks, techno music and threw in some hissing to boot, but it was in one word: terrible.  don't watch it if you've read the books unless you just want to piss yourself off.",1364860800,,2226,4.318840579710145

this movie had grand possibilities.  but trying to force two novels into two hours really ruined this for me.  yes, this is most certainly an anne-rice-novel-purist review but even as a movie, there are so many plot holes...

let me start off by saying that townsend did a really good job at portraying a brat prince. but some of the problems with the story line as it was written really robbed lestat of his depth.  and this of course was partially because they were trying to include character background from ""the vampire lestat"" to fill the void but it just didn't work.  and the other characters were also robbed of background and depth as well. plus... they could have given him written lestat traits.  but i guess the powers that be saw differently.

1. lestat was not sired by marius, he was sired by magnus and he had no choice in the matter. this is important because shortly after magnus turns lestat, he jumps into the fire and dies thusly leaving lestat to fend for himself with no knowledge about what he has just become. this is actually a theme in lestat's life before becoming a vampire. he only had a few people he was close to including his mother and nicolas.

2. lestat was a performer, not a musician per se. while it is true that he did play the violin for akasha and enkil, the only reason why he had a violin in the first place was because it had been sent to him after nicolas de lenfent took his own life, also jumping into the fire. nicki was the violinist. not lestat. lestat's back history with nicolas was important as it explained lestat's later fixation with louis in interview.

3. the story about the twins, maharet and mekare, is another grand part of the story that was cut.  the twins were part of the story of how vampires began... really great story-telling on the part of anne rice literally re-writing vampire folklore.  the film only has marius explaining that akasha and enkil were fierce vampires that nearly killed all of egypt until enkil lost the will to kill... and after that akasha became lost missing her husband. and then they turned into marble statues. i would have loved to have seen this exactly how anne rice wrote it, but they didn't even cut it short, they just cut it completely out altogether. why is this an important part of the story?  it helps explain why akasha is the way she is in the film.  she wasn't a nice egyptian queen and she just carried that over as the queen of the damned. depth is good... it affects how you feel about the characters you are watching: whether you feel sympathy for them or you wish the hero smashes them to bits!

4. the gaggle of miscellaneous vampires in the akasha death scene... who are they and where did they come from?  which one is louis?  which one is khayman?  which one is armand? where is gabrielle?  where is mekare? where is pandora? no background on any of these characters at all. also, there is no romantic interest between lestat and jesse in the book.  mekare is supposed to show up and kill akasha but instead, since there is no story of the twins and the background that would explain it... everyone kills akasha as a team effort.  but this also doesn't make sense if you think about vampire lore, you know that killing the head vampires means that everyone that was made from that vampire is also dead.  but the way that anne rice wrote it and explained it in her novel, it made sense.  which is another reason why the story about the twins was important.

5. lestat's character in the books does accept the fact that he is most definitely a killer... a part of the savage garden.  but he chooses to use his gift of mind-reading to separate the evildoer from the rest of the world.  and he feeds on them.  or there is the ""little drink"".  all part of the world that anne rice created. not so much in this film. there was no mind-reading in the film at all and all the vampires were messy eaters.  just little details that didn't necessarily have to be explained in words... but most definitely could have been acted out.

while there are probably a dozen plus additional things that could be added to this little write-up... as a stand-alone film it does have good special effects and the actors stuart townsend and aaliyah did give provocative performances.  over the years i have gone from really hating this movie to it being at least bearable to watch.  if i could give this 2.5 stars i would because i don't really HATE it. i just think they could have done a way better job. or actually divided this into two or more movies. i can only hope that at some point in the future that this will be re-done properly... anne rice's vampire chronicles truly deserves to be honored in this manner.",1358899200,2,4735,4.476135040745052

1733833,2,B000069I5V,"I really really wish Tom Cruise would have revamped his role in this film. Stuart Townsend sucked as a substitute. No pun intended. Just really bad acting.

The whole script was poorly done, as if the creativity to convert the book to film just wasn't there or their hearts weren't in it.
Aaliyah was very good, considering what she had to work with.

Now, Ms. Rice is a born again Christian who disavows the occult work that helped make her rich and famous. No account for odd balls in this world, but it helps to be one when one is a multimillionaire for all that they now hold in regret. So we won't have anymore installments of the Lestat series, thank God. Literally. Not that the two installments thus far make that fact a real disappointment.
Not even fan fiction on the Vamp. series or any Rice books exist on the net. Ms. Rice will sue anyone who dares. Though fan's writing can't promise to be any worse than the script that brought this dog to life.

But if we did have a chance prior to the conversion, one would have hoped if this movie could have been done right that at least and besides a better script, Cruise would have signed on. Especially now that one of his most recent features, ""Rock of Ages"", demonstrates the man can actually sing.(Yes, that's him and not lip sync) As could Townsend of course. Though Cruise was much better at the vamp acting part, while Townsend did look like he was the walking dead. And that's without makeup. And did he diet for this part? Or did he have an eating disorder? Ick! Put the shirt BACK ON!

What sucks about both movies; this and it's predecessor, Interview with the Vampire, is the monotone dead pan voice Lestat had through the whole thing. He's dead! It doesn't mean the vampires voice or emotions have to sound like they bit the dirt too.

This movie is better if you rent it at the library. With shipping added to the purchase price, you'll be out money you could have spent on something much more entertaining. Like artificial vampire teeth to pop in your mouth and surprise the UPS driver when they bring this years Christmas present delivery to you door.
Just the look on their face as you smile big and ask them:""What can I DO for Brown?"" Is worth the money.

Rest in peace, Aaliyah.",1354320000,,2253,4.456310679611651
1733834,3,B000069I5V,"First let me say that Stuart Townsend is the PERFECT Lestat.  Rock star looks, a mischevious narcisism and just a hint of a French accent (yes, Tom Cruise, Lestat is French).  Aliyah did a great job as the title character as well but it was Townsend who made the movie for me, and it is campy fun as well.  But understand that the film makers have taken great artistic license and this movie would be better named The Vampire Lestat meets The Queen of the Damned since most of the movie is actually taken from Anne Rice's second novel, The Vampire Lestat, and very little from her third one, Queen of the Damned.  Even that is not entirely accurate, by accident or by design I'm not sure.  The movie begins with Lestat being made a vampire by Marius who then deserts him to fend for himself only to return to counsel him when Lestat has become a rock star who threatens to expose the world's vampires.  However in the novel Lestat was made by Magnus, who then killed himself leaving Lestat alone.  Lestat doesn't even meet Marius until near the end of The Vampire Lestat and its not Marius who comes back to counsel him but Louis, from the original Interview with the Vampire.  Maybe they didn't have the budget to hire two different actors.  Despite all this I really do enjoy the movie as a Saturday afternoon fun movie.",1354147200,14,1322,4.475

1733845,4,B000069I5V,"After reading some mixed reviews here, I thought I'd check out the film, which is loosely based on the Anne Rice books, Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned.  The filmmakers cut out the entire Egyptian history with the Twins and the Family (except for one scene) and did not bother to name the important characters in the Mohave Desert (in Sonoma in the book).  Alayah was pretty hot; I did not know that she had died in a plane crash several months after filming.

Lestat rises from the grave and decides to be a rock star.  The music was just OK if you're into the gothic heathen-type music.  Townsend was great as the under-toned Lestat.  He discovers Those Who Must Be Kept (I know that from the book -- not mentioned in the film!) and has a sip of blood and becomes a super vamp.

As the film continues, it does not build much with the Lestat character's desires for ruling.  The Queen has him awaken with the sunlight, on an island of corpses.  No explanation.  In the book she had a hatred for Men and considered them the cause of evil.  Here in the film, she kills with no reason.

Bottom Line:  A pretty good horror film.  The emphasis on the Talamasca and Jesse was ""OK"" but not really as inviting as in the book.  And without the addition of The Twins storyline, the Jesse part really does not make a lot of sense.

What happened to New Orleans?

Certainly this is no masterpiece of cinema but if you like action movies with a supernatural twist you will likely find it entertaining.  The acting is nothing spectacular but it is was nowhere near bad enough to interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  Actually my biggest complaint is the way that Ayasha keeps swaying her hips with every movement- I get that she is supposed to be sensuous but it gets a little bit ridiculous.,1346976000,,551,4.435643564356436
1733849,2,B000069I5V,"Lestat awakens from a self-inflicted century long seep.  He had become tired of being alone and immortal. He awakens to the sound of a rock band jamming and he takes his violin as he looks for his first meal, fresh blood.  He then goes to his old house where the band is practicing.  He betrays his code of secrecy and tells them that he is the vampire Lestat.

He joins the band as lead singer and the band has a sky rocking success with their powerful beat and vocals performed by Lestat.  The real vampires hate him for his coming out into public saying  that he is a vampire.  People don't really believe that he is a vampire but think it is just part of his so called music persona.

Lestat's music has unknowingly awakened the most ancient of vampires, Akasha who is the Queen of the vampires.  In addition the ancient order of the Talamasca is following Lestat's actions with detailed interest to see what is going on as they really know who he is.  A group of the oldest surviving vampires are also banding together to fight against Akasha and her plans to take over the world.

While this movie is OK it does not follow the books of Anne Rice and this film is a combination of two books.  I am a real Anne Rice fan and for me this movie lost much of the depth of the great stories by trying to do too much in one film.  I enjoyed the movie but it could have been so much more and should have been two separate movies.  So much of the details and history is missing that would have made this movie a 5 star production.  In many cases the story is not even close to the books.

It is still worth seeing as it is a good film.  I only gave it 2 stars for not following the books and as a result the story is much weaker than the original tale as told by Anne Rice.  You should also read the books if you like this movie.",1346457600,,1825,4.121813031161473

In a word, Queen of the Damned was trite. Every sensitive little vamp boy needs a cute human girlfriend, so a queen arises, is vanquished, and leaves him with the girlfriend turned undead, happily ever after. WHAT a plot.

It's hard to comment on the acting when there was so little for the actors to portray.

The visuals are nice. It's uncommon for vampire flicks to have people spontaneously bursting into flame and turning into charred human embers in a span of five seconds. Also, the use of a natural redhead -- freckles and all -- is satisfying.

Nothing else is innovative. But, if you like vampire flicks, the way one might like romantic comedies with a beach setting, then sure, watch it. You'll get nothing new out of it and it's not memorable.",1342828800,,838,4.641891891891892
1733852,2,B000069I5V,"""The Queen of the Damned"" is my favorite of all Anne Rice's many books; a highly imaginative work of fiction full of interesting characters, near non-stop action and viscerally compelling storylines, all converging in a stunning, explosive climax. It's a tour de force, and whatever else one might think about Ms. Rice and her subsequent career, it makes for a truly entertaining read. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this awful, AWFUL movie, which bears virtually no resemblance to the book in letter or spirit. When it's not downright annoying it's mind-numbingly boring and must rank as one of the worst vampire movies of the last 25 years. Gone are Rice's amazing stories of gods, men and vampires spanning 5,000 years of human civilation; gone the angst of otherness and the wisdom that comes with millenia. All replaced with MTV-ish glitz and shallow, clueless characters who look and sound like rejects from a second-rate video game. I can't remember the last time I've been so disappointed by a screen adaptation. My advice; read the book. Avoid this mind-numbing stinkburger of a movie at all costs.",1342742400,3,1119,5.021505376344086
1733853,4,B000069I5V,"I'm a big fan of the novels.  I was astonished of how they took two books and made one movie out of it.  It was beautifully shot, very sensual and gothic.  The soundtrack was kick-ass which made it feel like a long MTV video.  The deleted scenes add more story, but are worth watching after viewing the movie for fill ins.  I personally re-edited it with all the deleted scenes and extended music to give it more of a rock movie feel.  It flows fine though without it, but I love the videos. The costumes and make-up were fierce.  One disappointment - Some of the actors didn't fit the original descriptions of the characters at all.  The original DVD was one of few that really had a lot to offer in extras.  Hopefully this one will to.  I'll buy it and watch it with my headphones and the music turned all the way up!",1339545600,,819,4.259740259740259

1733874,1,B000069I5V,"Most of the other reviewers were right: This movie sucked!
It was bad!
These are my reasons:
In the book:
1. Lestat was blonde, not a dark red head!
2. Lestat and Jessie never got emotionally involved with one another!
3. Stuart Townsend was a great vampire, but he was not Lestat!
4. Lestat killed evil doers, not young women who liked rock stars!
5. The story was supposed to be about Akasha, not Lastat... that is why the book is called 'QUEEN OF THE DAMNED'!
6. Marias was not Lastat's maker!

The other things wrong with this movie are:
7. It did not follow the book at all!
8. Most of the actors were stale.
9. Lena Olin's character was the only one who matched her description in the book!
10. There was no character development for any of the characters except Lastat!

Overall; This movie was a major let down to both fans and movie-goers alike!

Although 'Interview with a Vampire' was very good (except Armand just plainly was not the Armand of the book), 'The Queen of the Damned' is no where even remotely close to the book. How she killed her male counter part, the journey she took Lestat on. None of this is in the book. I would give more detail but it would spoil the movie for anyone else.

1733883,4,B000069I5V,"I'm not a huge fan of Anne Rice. Used to be, not anymore. I also realize the movie does not have a whole lot in common with the book. Having made those two points, I will now post my review based on the MOVIE (not the book):
First, while the tagline is stupid, the movie is not! Two things stuck out for me about the film: the inherent sexiness that typifies the modern vampire and the INCREDIBLE soundtrack. Between Stuart Townsend, Paul McGann (of ""Horatio Hornblower""), and Vincent Perez, I was in heaven! The sets were great, the costumes awesome, and the actors pretty good. I've always like the gothic/vamp rock subculture, so the idea of a vamp musician was a pretty easy segue for me.
Yes, I do realize how different this movie is from the books,I like it regardless. While I LOVE Rice's flair for description/detail in writing, I think that much of her work is repetitive and overrated. This movie, I believe, is BETTER than the books. It is more of a work of fanfiction (banned by Rice, btw) than anything else: a love of characters in a setting that would flourish. It really does not matter whether or not you are a fan of Anne Rice - this movie doesn't need a precendent. It is what it is: an entertaining, romantic movie aimed at a gothic female audience.
One of my all-time favorite movies (and soundtracks).",1316736000,,1323,4.516666666666667
1733894,2,B000069I5V,"I started reading the Vampire Chronicles after watching ""Interview With the Vampire"" when I was about 11. ""Queen of the Damned"" came out when I was in high school and, at the time, I was really into that type of music. I was disappointed that the movie was so different than the book, though I understand that the several different story lines in the book would be hard to translate to a movie, it would have been nice for some of the main plots to be seen. Stuart Townsend definately depicts the modern Lestat in the same way that Tom Cruise was able to embody the 18th-19th century Lestat. All in all, it's worth a watch once or twice, but it was a disappointment. Anne Rice should have been allowed to write the script for this installment as she did for ""Interview With the Vampire"" and I think we would have been more pleased.",1309910400,,831,4.402597402597403
1733895,5,B000069I5V,"So this is an older movie, but still very good if you like this sort of thing.  This film is a movie adaptation of Anne Rice's novel by the same name.  Although the script writers seemed to take a lot of liberties with the story line, I wasn't  disappointed.  My only real complaint is that Stuart Townsend doesn't really look much like Lestat.  They could have given him blonde hair at least.  Don't get me wrong, he does a fine job with the part, and I definately liked him better than Tom Cruise for the role, but just a little more attention to detail would have made it perfect.  Is this movie cheesy?  Absolutely!  Does that take away from the overall experience?  Not at all!",1309824000,,682,4.384
1733896,2,B000069I5V,"This movie took The Vampire Lestat & Queen of the Dammed and merged into on VERY bad movies.

Do yourself a favor and read these two books and don't watch the movie.",1308441600,,165,4.15625
1733897,5,B000069I5V,"I want to say that I refused to watch ""Queen Of The Damned"" for the longest time because I was so afraid of how bad it was supposed to be. The trailer for this film does it no justice, and the amount of negative reviews, plus it seemed as if the whole 'Vampire Chronicles' was raped by these fimmakers, allegedly.

Now, after finally letting curiosity get the better of me, I finally relented and bought a copy of ""Queen Of The Damned"" on widescreen DVD. I won't bother w/ going into plot and/or characters (except to correct reviewers who think the film made a mistake by opening with Lestat arising from a coffin, and not picking up where ""Interview With The Vampire"" left off. That's because ""Interview"" was LOUIS' story, and this is LESTAT'S story. Reread the novels if you need to, in case you don't believe me. Lestat even declared Louis a great liar about a LOT of what was said in ""Interview""), but I will state that this is the BEST vampire movie ever!! I would even rate this film higher than ""Interview With the Vampire"", which kind of bores me after seeing this one. Plus, I could have done without having to see all the rat eating scenes in ""Interview""!

Don't pay attention to other reviews, get this movie and make up your own mind. I'm sure you'll be glad that you did, especially if you're a fan of the 1st three novels by Anne Rice. Sure, some things get left out, but my god it would take a 3-part mini-series just to tell ""The Vampire Lestat"", and another 4 or 6 hours for ""The Queen Of The Damned"". And a large part that was cut was just repetitive stuff to begin with. And, plus, now there's the chance to make an entire film about ""The Legend of the Twins"". That story is not dead (as some reviewers on Amazon seem to think). Just because it wasn't in this film doesn't mean it can't be used in another!

The filmmakers of ""Queen Of The Damned"" pieced together the most important aspects of the story that connected between two novels and ran with them and made an extraordinary masterpiece! Vive Lestat!! And, the soundtrack by Korn's Jonathan Davis & Marilyn Manson is AWESOME!! I have to admit, years ago after reading the books, I imagined a band like Queensryche or Judas Priest (someone with an operatic voice) doing the soundtrack, but I must admit that the 'Goth' music was SO perfect for it in my opinion; and, that (along with the whole 'Fellini' look of the film) is why I love it so much. Yes, it's a bit hokey in spots, but overall, I don't know why so many people hate it as much as they do.

Reviews for this are split down the middle. If you like music and old-school style filmmaking then you may just like this. I'm not really that into vampire flicks. I HATE the whole ""Twilight""/tween fad that's overtaking the country. I didn't care for the vampire films of the 80's either. But I liked Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"" and Anne Rice's first 4 or 5 (vampire) novels, and the films based on them.

And the DVD is SO loaded w/ bonuses that definitely make this a very worthwhile investment!

This is the final series of Anne Rice's trilogy that started with Interview With a Vampire that starred Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.  Being an Anne Rice fan and having read the whole trilogy, I was disappointed with Interview, it didn't really follow the book and was way too commercialized.  This on the other hand was more true to the feel of the book and I still watch it after 15 years.  Now as much as I like it I'll be the first to admit some of the lines are kind of corny and out of place.

Now let me clarify this right off the bat: I'm a HUGE Anne Rice fan.  The Vampire Chronicles are among my favorite books of all time.  This film is neither a faithful adaptation of Queen of the Damned nor of The Vampire Lestat, which it also borrows from.  Rather, it is a sort of ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the 2 novels, with several liberties taken, the most obvious being with how Lestat is ""born"" into the vampire world.

Now, if you can simply accept those facts, and that this is intended to be a popcorn/fun little flick, you might actually enjoy it.  The acting isn't half bad, and the cinematography and visual effects are a lot of fun.  Plus it has a soundtrack that, if you like bands like Korn and Disturbed, you should really dig.",1304121600,,775,4.492857142857143

I read the reviews and most of them were so bad I assumed the movie was going to be horrible which may be why I did end up liking it because I went in thinking it was going to be one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I thought the acting was good and the story as well. Aaliyah is just beautiful and talented (such a shame she died) and Stuart Townsend is incredibly sexy so what's not to like there?! The effects do look very dated but things are so much more advanced now. I also liked how it had a happy ending because I am a real sucker for nice endings. Concerning the story content, it isn't as dark as it looks nor as bloody as one might assume. I think the title makes people think it is going to be this evil evil movie, which it isn't. Of course this isn't an incredibly deep philosophical movie, but it is a fantasy so you are supposed to step into it and forget about reality's rules. If you like vampires, rock music, and great looking actors then this is the movie for you. From what I have read from other reviews, if you like the books, don't watch this.

It does feature a great gothic soundtrack, some of the songs were specifically made for this movie and are quite fitting, worth listening to if you're into the genre. And, there's a pretty amazing leading duo. I liked Stuart's version of Lestat, he does play the part well, and Aaliyah's Akasha is something to behold. Too bad there are some silly lines to spoil it all.

This movie could have been great, but as it is, it's 'good'.",1235260800,2,951,4.485549132947977

1733967,1,B000069I5V,"Not a very good film I deem

Maybe its hard for me. I picked up the book of the Queen of the Damned day it came out at Bookends, after reserving a copy

It was a good book. Not as solid as Lestat, but a solid book, with enjoyable bits: of Armand being confounded by a telephone and an interesting story concerning some twins

But this.. this is a mess. Firstly, the Queen of the Damned is the THIRD book in the series, after the Vampire Lestat, which is probably the best of the Anne Rice books in whats become known as the Vampire Chronicles

So Interview with the Vampire, skipping to The Queen of the Damned (filmwise)?

Now, the Queen of the Damned (the book) is all over the place, you've got several points of view, from Baby Janks to Jessica to the Vampire Armand

So it was always gonna be difficult getting it translated to film. The Vampire Lestat (book 2) is a more straight forward tale, an adventure story starting in Paris about Lestat and his best friend Nicki (who Anne Rice did not like, but allowed Lestat to love).

And it all goes downhill from there! (Lestat has a terrible time in Paris and has to abandon it to the Theatre of Vampires, which is encountered by Louis in the 1st book & movie (Interview with the Vampire)

So thats where we are - you've got Louis' point of view in Interview (Khayman's humorous surmise of it: ""Behold the void""). Then Lestat comes along and his book (autobiography: TVL) is very much a reaction to Louis's tale (Khayman on The Vampire Lestat: ""This. And this. And this. And it means nothing"")

Then Queen of the Damned, dealing with the fall out from Lestats concert (waking the Mother, the twins story, and a resolve of the situation, for good and evil)

So what do you get in the movie? Well, nothing really. Marius is kept from The Vampire Lestat, but hes younger, and theres not the intimacy between the two men in the book, where Marius saves the younger mans life because he recognizes so much of Lestat in himself and the timing of his transformation (they both were born to the blood at the cusp of a new age). Here you really don't get too much of an idea of makes the two tick.

You've got Lestat being a rock god, playing with Satans Night Out in San Francisco (nice touch to have him on the cover of Mojo magazine - that bit I DID like) - that bit was kept (the concert happens in books 2&3, and many characters go to it to find out whats what)

But no Louis? no Gabrielle? Well, okay, I guess if this is The Queen of the Damned and you're gonna leave a bit out of the 2nd book, fine, but Louis & Gabrielle were pretty close to Lestat and helped you understand him

And no Nicki too? which destroyed Lestat with his fate and sent him into the ground (to be revived by Marius, who then took him to Those Who Must Be Kept)

I just don't get why Anne Rice didn't speak up and denounce this rubbish. I mean, I'm prejudiced, I really like the books.

But this isn't really true to the books! I can get leaving Louis, Gabrielle. But no Armand? (no Armand?! WTF?! his relationship is crucial to Lestat, who even seeks him out later for help in TVL!)

Theres not much on show here. You've got some vampires flying around at the concert, and GOD it just looks stupid! You've got the Queen of the Damned, but theres no depth there (no background on what makes her tick)

And Jessica puts herself in harms way.. uh why? In the book she was never so foolish as to confront certain death; she did go to the concert against advice, but not deliberately into a dangerous situation

Just a mess. Please: just read the book! The movie really doesn't add much to the ouevre and should be shunned like the plague. An appalling film.

After this there were to be no other films featuring Lestat. Interview was a great film (it changed the book here and there - it was Louis's wife who had died, not his brother) but it got the essence of the book right (Louis telling off Armand on the end, noting his emptiness).

The only thing this film has to do with the book is maybe it keeps a couple of the names from it!

And its even rated lower than the Star Wars Holiday Special at Rotten Tomatoes.. Yikes!",1228176000,,4147,4.297817715019256

I admit, there are some parts I get bored during.  But there are scenes that I absoloutely love.  The movie is entertaining though, as well as sexy.  And Aaliyah is also in this movie, showing if she was not taken from us at such a young age, she had so much to offer us.  Stewart Townsend makes a sexy vampire, though I was actually dissappointed that he doesn't look like he does in the film.

Now, the special features on the DVD are great.  I love the music videos.  I watch those a lot.  And the extended concert footage is really good.  I've seen the movie 3 times before buying the DVD.  I've now owned the DVD for a month and really have yet to watch the movie.  I watch the videos.  The songs are great.

1733998,5,B000069I5V,"Despite what everyone seems to be saying, especially that guy from the New Yorker, this is the first vampire movie I've ever seen that I actually really liked. (Other than Underworld, which I consider more of a werewolf movie.) And that was despite my ultra-skepticism about the ""vampire becomes rock star"" theme. I only watched it because a friend begged me to. I was very pleasantly surprised. It puts a new spin on the most bland and disappointing monsters ever conceived--vampires--and makes them enjoyable. Stuart Townsend blows away Tom Cruise as Lestat. Cruise = boring, obviously acting, wooden, large nose. Townsend = funny, natural, stylish, refreshing.

I showed it to an equally skeptical friend of mine recently, expecting him to complain afterwards, but he liked it too. The only complaint I have is the totally pathetic ""vampire motion"" effect that looks like something a high school film student did. But as far as the plot, script, and general performance went, they were great--and those are what most other vampire flicks lack. And the film wasn't disgusting and gory like most modern monster flicks, nor was it overfilled with completely pointless sex scenes or chase scenes that serve no other purpose than to fill up frames for moviemakers that are too lazy to put some actual thought into their productions.

I'd put this right up there with Dark City as one of the most underrated sci-fi/fantasy movies out there. Sure, the special effects aren't as good as the first Matrix, but they use special effects sparingly--in support of the story, not in place of it--and have boatloads more substance than the vast majority of the competition.",1203379200,2,1661,5.036363636363636

1734003,5,B000069I5V,"This movie, in all its aspects, is pleasing.  Keep in mind that I have read the entire Vampire Chronicles Series.  Unlike many who found it to be twisted away from the natural plot of the book, that is true.  Therefore, if this is what you a looking for in the movie, it's probably not for you.

Queen of the Damned throws us in medias res of the two books ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned."" Lestat creates is his new band without a problem.  Then, we are taken to Jessie, who reads his tale through his diary.  This is where the movie gets all messed up. It somehow manages to tell the whole transformation of Lestat into a vampire while missing some major points, but still, the movies plot is intact and no holes are left.  Someone who had never read the books would be able to follow along with no problem.  You will find throughout the movie that mostly everything is alike, setting aside the change in creators and what not.

Important characters from the novels are also left out, but this doesn't distract from the movie at all, unless you were looking for it.

Onto the acting.  I've noticed that a lot of people had grievances with the actors. If you watch their facial expressions, you will see that they are exaggerated, which was how Anne Rice described them in her books. The vampires move elegantly, act sensual, and have a classic feel while still pertaining to Rice's originality.

Overall, the movie is wonderful when its not nit-picked. To watch it and enjoy the different take on the story is what makes it a very popular film of mine.",1198108800,2,1572,4.496478873239437

Whereas the big screen adaptation of Interview with the Vampire stayed true to the original written work, the Queen of the Damned does nothing of the sort: the story is completely wrong and the vampires are nothing like the ones portrayed in the books. In fact, the only good thing about this film is its soundtrack. If you liked the books, please don't watch this film and just stick to its predecessor.

1734007,3,B000069I5V,"Fans of the novels, do not watch this movie.  I repeat, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!  I'll be quick because many other reviewers have already done the work of telling what is wrong with this film on the basis of relating it to the novel.  The story is almost completely changed, and by that I mean almost nothing from the novel translated over onto film with the intention of keeping everything concise and the story linear.  Some very deep and important parts from the novel are either changed dramatically or cut out completely, and that is where the movie fails.  In trying to see this movie because of the novel..don't.

However, as a stand-alone movie to watch, without comparison to the novel and by suspending your disbelief, this movie isn't half bad.  The acting is okay and the characters themselves are believable enough.  A lot of people have said that Stuart Townsend ruined the character of Lestat; I disagree.  While Tom Cruise did indeed do an amazing job, Townsend didn't do half bad considering the rushed script he had to work with.  His only downfall is that he may have tried ""too hard"" to win the fans over with his portrayel and just didn't act naturally.

The movie itself was shot very well.  It has a dark sort of ""music video"" quality about it, and the soundtrack adds so much as well.  The story itself is good (but seems rushed) and the action in the film is directly related to the story.  And of course, the late Aaliyah did do a very good job as the Queen herself.  Akasha was a cold-hearted character that felt little or no remorse, and Aaliyah does a good job at adding some depth to that person.

Overall, I gave ths movie three stars because as I said, as a stand-alone film it really isn't half bad.  If you are trying to see the work of Anne Rice's novel in here, forget it.  If you want to sit and enjoy the movie for what it is, then you will; if you go in looking for comparison, you're wasting your time.",1187308800,,1942,4.422535211267606
1734008,1,B000069I5V,"Oh, it hurts... It hurts my head... I fear watching it might cause an aneurysm. And I could spit in the face of anyone who dares compare Stuart Townsend to Tom Cruise. There's no contest. Tom understood the character, felt for him, became him. Anne Rice, herself, said he was the perfect Lestat and called Townsend's... Whatever that was as being too cold and humourless and not her Lestat but these teeny boppers (Oh, dear, I'm labelling) can't accept that and latch on to what they consider to be a pretty face. Townsend wasn't playing Lestat. He was playing Dracula in a leather coat but I could rant for hours about that.

When Tom Cruise played Lestat in Interview with The Vampire there was layers to the personality. The pleading look as he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' The way he worried for Louis as Louis ran out into the rain, the way he saved Louis from the fire, the angst the personality it was all there.

WIth Stuart Townsend you had nothing. The acting was wooden. Shallow. And even if you had never read the Anne Rice novels this movie doesn't stand up on it's own. It makes little sense. And the 'hero' kills innocent girls at random because according to the director's commentary good and evil are too abstract to feed on evil doers as he did in the novels. What's so abstract about killing murderers who feel no remorse? Good and evil were major themes in the book but anyway... Aside from the book this 'hero' had to be told twice that Akasha had killed her old king from two completely different characters. And each time he was surprised. Talk about a short attention span. This movie was designed to appeal to people with a very low IQ and little respect for the original source material, be it Interview with the vampire the movie or the novels. And as a stand alone film I don't think I'd even tolerate it on Mystery science theatre.

I did like the songs Forsaken and Not meant for me so I'll give it credit for that but ONLY that. Fortunately for us people who actually have a mind of our own and care about character personalities we have the Sir Elton John's Lestat musical, too bad the San Francisco version was better.",1186704000,,2160,4.4910941475826975

1734037,1,B000069I5V,"I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned.  Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad.  Turns out, the word bad is an understatement.

Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc.  But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat.  I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away.  The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included.  Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown.  Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing.

I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply ""everybody must die!"".  Period.  That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to.  I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie.

Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked.  What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film?  Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours.  Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles?  Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire.

I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc.  Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence ""revealing"" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place.  I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me.

Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time.  But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie.",1166486400,2,3448,4.338006230529595

He's like the hottest 500yr old ever! You don't have to love VAMPIRES to love this film. Lestat (Townsend) is a rebellious loner type vampire who is fed up with living in the shadows of eternity and wants to live out in the open of the 21st century. So he does what anyone who wants to be heard, known and worshiped would do... he becomes a rock star. It's there in his new found fame and fortune that he catches the eye of a young woman named Jesse. She becomes facinated with Lestat and the dark relm he lives in. Then theres the competition, Akasha,(R&B singer Aaliyah) the Queen of all who are damned. Aaliyah gives a grand performance as this ""take no crap from any human or fanged fiend"" mother of vampires everywhere. This movie is the latest in the Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice. It is not set in the 1400's but it does give tales of the old and the new.

1734040,1,B000069I5V,"This movie was a huge disappointment for me. I should've written this review 4 yrs. ago, but I'm writing it now because I've recently purchased this dvd version. I saw this movie a day after it was released w/o reading the book and was left wanting more for some reason. I finally read the book and came to the conclusion that they made an absolute mess of what had the makings to be an excellent movie. I appreciated the restylization of the dirty ""biker"" vampires into the sleek, model types at the bar and very much appreciate the director for casting a black actress (and appropriately so...Aaliyah was perfect in the role) to portray an Egyptian queen, but that's about it. After listening to the director's comments in the DVD, it seems they eliminated/sacrificed scenes or parts from the book that had relevance; their excuses for eliminating such scenes for reasons of complexity, time compression and confusion only confuse those who read the book and fans of the Vampire Chronicles. There were so many mitakes made in this film in the name of ""time"". Maybe it was me, but I could hear the uncertainty and ""regret"" in their voices... If you watch the dvd with the comments you might undertand what I'm talking about. I came away with the impression that they were somehow pressed for time or just hodge-podged ideas when writing the screenplay; an absolute mess! Despite what everyone says, I liked their choice for Lestat and Stuart Townsend's sexy, seductive rendition of him...the French accent made the character more interesting.  I don't know why they even fathomed screwing things up with a ""love triangle"" of sorts between Akasha, him, and the ""vampire groupie"", Jesse. I thought that tag line was pretty cheap and clichd. I guess it was done for the young viewers...If you read the book, I thought it was a shame they made the Jesse character into some weak, lovesick vampire groupie who obsessed over Lestat. Or maybe they should've cast a better actress for that part; there was absolutely no chemistry between Townsend and Moreau, whatsoever! It was most disappointing that Aaliyah wasn't given more screen time and better direction. The entire movie suffered because of its direction and awful screenplay...

The soundtrack (and I'm not into ""goth"" or ""nu-metal"") is excellent, appropriate, and sets the mood for the film; very, very good job by Korn's Jonathan Davis as a ""novice"" soundtrack composer.

Warner Bros.'s instinct to shelf this movie at first was the right choice. If anything they should've fired the director soon after it was screened!",1161648000,,2574,4.926267281105991

Featuring B list actors so physically unlike their characters they're unrecognisable until you read the credits, it was almost guaranteed to outrage all of the Rice fanatics and derail the gravy train. As such this must go down in the annals of cinema history as a piece of supremely self destructive stupidity.

And apparently the viewer is supposed to feel warm and chummy with the lead couple at the end of the movie.  But along the way, huge numbers of (mostly) female victims die in the clutches of these same vampires (well, by the male half of the couple).  The awfulness of movie comes through in a scene where the lead vampire is disgusted by a beach-full of human victims he and the Queen produced the night before; the statement of the movie is that the continuing deaths of groupies, prostitutes, and other vulnerable humans is forgivable, as long as the complete destruction of humanity doesn't result from the vampires' presence.  We are supposed to, in fact, feel pleased with this outcome.  A sound moral compass is not a requirement for a horror movie of this type.

Chronicles and the Mayfair witchs chronicles, I thought ok Ann has another vampire movie from the chronicles. I called my best friend up and said "" Kim let's go see Queen of the Dammned""

Now for years I had been telling Kim about Ann's books and how great they are. I even made her rent Interview with a Vampire but its not like she did not want to see Brad Pitt OMG he is hot.

Any way we paid our $7.50 a piece for tickets (Really was not happy about the price but it was Ann Rice after all) got our $10.00 bucks worth of popcorn and pop.

My first clue that this movie was going to suck should of been the millions of Goth wearing teenagers lol. But no I just fig that these kids were fans. I mean Ann can't just have 30 year old fans like me at the time lol( I'm only a little older now) I kept telling Kim while we waiting for the movie to start that the first movie was well done and pretty much stuck to the books story so this one should be just as good if not better.

Oh if only I knew how wrong I was that faithful night. The movie did not stick even close to the book and the scence's were dark and gritty. And I'm sorry people Aaliyah sucked I can't even remember if she had lines. I'm sure she did but nothing that stands out to make her shine. Besides that dang dancing thing she did through the movie was getting on my last nerve. As for my beloved Lestant, please that kid and I do mean kid could not bring justice to Lestant. I kind of felt that Kid could not act his way out of a paper sack let alone take on a role like Lestant.

Now with all that said I have always told my kids to find the good side of a bad deal. So with that said I will say the sound track was not bad for the movie. I did like it enough to buy the sound track only.

Bottom line if you are a true ANN RICE fan don't waste your time on this movie.

1734058,1,B000069I5V,"I'm gonna cut to the chase and say this:  had the same or similar cast and crew that filmed Interview with the Vampire filmed the combination of The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, it would absolutely be a far better successor to the previous work filmed by Neil Jordan and starring Cruise, Pitt, Slater, Banderas, et al.

I totally hated the fact that the movie began with Lestat awakening from a coffin rather than having just recently made Daniel Malloy his latest fledgeling as he did in Interview.  Even moreso that, among other inconsistencies with The Vampire Chronicles, the film excluded his other surviving fledgelings such as Louis and Lestat's mother Gabrielle, and totally reworked the true history behing Lestat's becoming a vampire -- the fact that it was forced upon him by an especially demented, psychotic, and suicidal vampire named Magnus, and that Lestat later gained Marius as a mentor in much the same fashion as Louis had for a brief time with Armand.

For those who haven't yet seen the movie or read the book, this part is a spoiler.  What would have been even more dramatic and intense an ending to this movie would have been incorporating Akasha's true demise in her battle against her children.  In other words, rather that have her blood drained to the last drop by all involved, Mekare -- yet another character deliberately excluded from this film -- should have summoned up all her millenia of vampiric power to swiftly grab Akasha by her hair and toss her like a ragdoll into the wall or a mirror and tear her head off.  Let's even go so far as to graphically reveal Akasha's heart and brain being consumed by Mekare, with Maharet's aid, in order for her to now become the true Queen of the Damned.

In closing, the depictions of Marius and Lestat were inaccurate and extremely substandard.  What should be suggested is that the Sci-Fi Channel should start a limited series based as accurately as possible on the entire Vampire Chronicles saga, or at least the first five books (Interview, Lestat, Queen, Tale of the Body Thief, and Memnoch the Devil).  Considering Sci-Fi's track record with producing film novelizations of classics such as Dune, among others, I have no doubt that they would do a far better job than a major and sometimes overrated film company such as Warner Bros.",1144368000,4,2325,4.775561097256858

Among the Vampire chronicles I considered Lestat and Queen of the damned to be the best. Each was worthy of a film in their own rights. Why then would a filmaker cheat fans and mash them together into one horrible, mangled mess? What were they thinking? Lets start with Stuart Townsend as Lestat...are you &%$#ing kidding me? He falls so short of capturing Lestat's presence, his ability to draw others into his world that it sickened me. And Marius????? Please!!! Someone made a huge mistake with this movie.

This movie was pretty good, the music rocked and the blood/gore and horror was at a managable level and not overdone (I hate horror movies so I was thrilled that I could watch this without screaming).

But there were some things the writers forgot to include from the books: 1. Marius did not sire Lestat, a man named Magnus did and he killed himself befire he could teach Lestat anything

2. Maharet (Jessie's ""aunt"") is actually Jessie's great great great great etc. grandmother (she got preagnant by Enkil's aid Kayhman and had a kid before being sired) and she had a twin sister, both were witches in the time of Akasha's mortality and sireing

3. Lestat/Maharet don't kill Akasha by sucking her blood, Maharet's twin sister (who disapeared for a few decades and comes back) killes her by decapitation

And they didn't get into the history of Akasha very much which is sort of sad because you could see more into her hatred of Maharet and understand who the other vampires with Maharet are (Kayhman, Armond, Pandora, and Mickeal (sorry if I mispelled their names)).

But I supose they had to cut it short due to the fact that they cramed 2 books together (Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned) if they hadn't we could possibly have ended up with a movie the leangth of all 3 LOTR's (possibly)!

Lestat has returned after a long slumber.  He has chosen to join a heavy-metal rock band, much to the astonishment of the band's unsuspecting members.  Lestat promises them world-wide fame, and he certainly delivers on his promise.  Soon, the band is being shown on MTV, Lestat is giving press conferences, and they are playing sold-out concerts all over the world.  Lestat also encourages other vampires to come out of hiding.  ""Come out, come out, wherever you are"" he tells them.  But instead of uniting them, he angers them, and now the other vampires are searching for Lestat.

Lestat's music also awakens Egyptian vampire Akasha, who is one of the first vampires.  She is very powerful, is not afraid of sunlight, and can burn her enemies with a flick of her wrist.  She becomes infatuated with Lestat and chooses him to be her queen.  However, Lestat soon finds out that she is more evil and destructive than he can imagine.

Lestat cares for Jesse (Margueritte Moreau).  Jesse is a mortal girl who's aunt is a vampire.  Jesse's aunt, realizing that she could not properly care for Jesse, gave her away at a young age.  Now Jesse, having come across Lestat's personal journal from the 1700's, decides to track him down.  She knows about how Lestat was created by Marius (Vincent Perez) and she is determined to find Lestat.

I saw ""Interview With The Vampire"" several years ago, and I believe that it was a better film than this one.  For starters, I thought that the modern setting of this film was not as good as the first film's more gothic and older setting.  However, I believe that Stuart Townsend did a better job as Lestat than Tom Cruise did.  Having never read any of the vampire chronicles books, I cannot compare this movie to the novel.  I did think the movie itself was pretty good.  I thought Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah did very good jobs in their roles.  I thought that the rock band concept was a little far-fetched, however.

1734102,1,B000069I5V,"I have met up with a lot of cheesy fang thrillers and hated them. They always made vampires out to be jokes when I always considered them to be very serious creatures. Yet with Anne Rice's stories I thought no way they would ever do that to her material. I mean, look how well they did on Interview with the Vampire. It was done very beautifully and the actors themselves were strong and serious about their material and most importantly it was very faithful to the book with only one or two things changed, but nothing important enough for me to complain.

Then Damned came out. I watched it, and at the end of the film I was lost for words. My friends knew how strong of a fan I was of Anne Rice and obviously knew how crappy the film was to a Rice fan. I was really just adding up all the mistakes in the film, and boy were there A LOT.

Like, for one thing, why did they make it where Marius made Lestat? Why did they throw that in there? Just to speed up time, even though it is so wrong? They cut out a lot of the reunions the vampires made in Damned and that upset me.

And let's reflect on the makeup and costume. Marius and Lestat are blondes people in the book. Even Tom Cruise knew that and made enough time to color his hair- would it really have killed them to color their hair? None of the actors looked anything like the characters except for Akasha herself.

And I don't care what anyone says the man who played Lestat looked nothing like Lestat in the book and where was the Lestat charm? Tom Cruise played it as thick as honey and this other Lestat in Damned was so distant and dull. Akasha was overdramatic but I really don't have too many complaints about her she was actually all right, or a lot better than the others at least.

Another thing, where were all the characters? Half of them were cut out. Including- gasp- the main essence of the whole story- the other red- haired twin who is actually supposed to kill Akasha. They totally cut out the vital part of the story about the sisters.

Most assume I hate this movie just cause I'm a fan of the book but no it was also the way the movie was played out. The actors were dull and wooden and the movie in itself was turned into nothing but another cheesy vampire thriller with a bunch of fluff and no substance to be moved by. The actors themselves were cheesy. Honstly could they not afford better, more experienced actors like on Interview? Why couldn't they have paid more attention to the book like on Interview? Why couldn't this film have been like Interview, overall? I was really wishing for a whole series of films for Anne Rice's Chronicles, but if they are going to continue on making them as lame as this then I say just cut off all other filming plans.

Anne complained when Interview was being filmed, but she should have saved her hostile words for the near future when Damned would come out.

If you want cheesy teen fluff go on and watch Queen of the Damned. If you want a mature, in- depth and moving film on Anne Rice's actual vampires get Interview. And read Queen of the Damned of the book, for it is a good story- on paper.",1130457600,5,3120,4.276271186440678

It seems like they tossed a bunch of ideas together - a loose story about a band, goth rock, history, etc. - and topped it off with some shrill, overdramatic acting, special effects, and a story about vampire stuff.  It was ok, just some lite entertainment here and there, but the acting was so BAD.  It was also hyped up because the title character, The Queen of The Damned, Aaliyah, had died in a plane crash just before it's release and this would be her swan song.  She had potential talents, no question, but she was made out to be a scary, sexy beast of a thing which I doubt she would've wanted people to remember her as.  It was more about showing her perfectly fit body under those skimpy outfits.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because Stuart Townsend was some pretty sexy eye candy, even though they gothed him up with the white skin, make up and lighting.  I think he made an okay Lestat, and I dare say he would've given Tom Cruise a run for his money in Interview With The Vampire, but his talent and energy was wasted here in this half baked scare fest.",1127865600,5,1222,4.1923076923076925

Worth getting, if only to see her one more time.  On a scale of 1 to 10 (the highest), I rate this as a 8.

It is fluid, liquid.... magic. (If vampires existed this day and age it would suit them just fine because they wouldn't have to hide because the world has changed enough). and in  the end the lesser evil vanquishes evil because in the new world it is no longer good vrs evil.

I was disappointed with the movie after reading the book, but I think the movie can be good for people that have not read the book. I have now read the first 4 ""Vampire Chronicles"" books and I am currently reading ""The Witching Hour"". I have read all of this in just the span of a few months. Which is pretty amazing for a 15-year old.(Stuart Townsend is a member of the Talamasca in TWH. Hmm...)

IT IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE ON IT'S OWN!!! AND A LOUSY SEQUEL TOO!!!! Anne Rice complained at first for Tom Cruise being selected as Lestat for Interview with the Vampire, but after watching the movie, she stated that he portrayed him marvelously. It was in great part because of a incredibly well written script.

And now, they bring us a lousy vampire, who (God knows why) speaks all the time in whispers. In fact, every single vampire in this movie whispers! Did the producers or the director think that way the vampires would look scarier? More intense? Deeper? Damn! I felt I were back in the 70s. I like Stewart Townsend as an actor, but he failed to perform a good Lestat.

No climax at all, Akasha kills some vampires and nobody cares. No one cares also about Jesse's fate, mostly because she could have been removed from the movie and nobody would have noticed it.

And what's the deal with the lousy special effects? To fake vampire's preternatural speed they add some ridiculous trail. I could have done that in After Effects!. And AAliyah? Well, she portrayed the most powerful bellydancer ever, but that was all. Marius, the Ancient, only looked ancient because of his' baldness, and not because of wisdom. Kayman was scarcely mentioned. Maharet had no real presence in the movie. Too many characters, none of them with significant relevance in the film. The credits even mention Pandora and Armand! Do anybody noticed them at all???

Also compare the magnificent score from IWTV (remember Liberame?), with the almost inexistent score in this one. I'm not talking about the rock music. I liked it. In fact, the only star I gave to the movie was because rock music in it was great, but the film lacked a solid support score.

Unfortunatley nothing of this can be said about ""Queen of the Damned"".  Taking not only ONE but TWO of the books from the Vampire Chronicles (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- the second and third books respectively)- The movie changes many of the important parts of the book, and even screws up some of the stuff explained in the first movie - like Lestat's creation by Marius- In the book it was done by a Vampire who burned himself to death right after creating Lestat, leaving him to figure everything out on his own, and even in the first movie Lestat explains that he never knew the one who made him. But the story goes on, rushing though the stories. Although it's not the greatest acting job, Aaliyah is the only saving grace of this movie, and sadly it was her last. The only really good scene is when Akasha (Aaliyah) walks into the Admiral's Arms (a club/pub for the living impared, and rips out another vampire's heart and eats it.  The part that dissapointed me the most was that they left out, which in my opinion, was the best part of ""the Queen of the Damned"" which depicts how Vampires came to be. The movie ends with a team effort by a group of Vampires that anyone who didn't read the book would understand who they are.

The Vampire Lestat & Queen of the Damned, imagine what my

opinion was, on seeing 700 plus pages comprised into a

90min story. Then one day a cable channel broadcasts the

movie and, sincerely I liked it a lot, it's entertaining,

it's a delight to the eyes to see the Vampire Lestat as a

Dionysian Rock Star. My favorite scenes are when Lestat

falls on the pair of groupies from the ceiling, when he

has to kill the gipsy girl and the pain, that as a consequence, he experiments when he realizes of the things he has left behind unwillingly; and the rock concert its's simply fantastic, I wish the producers had filmed an entire concert to be included as a extra DVD.

THE MUSIC.

The music is the best part of the movie, besides Stuart Townsend being evil. The music sort of describes what Lestat is: angsty, angry, and completely vain. Lestat sounds amazing. If you haven't listened to any KoRn (thus tracking down the sounds of Jonathan Davis) and even if you have heard KoRn, you still feel that Lestat is a rock star, an excellent one.

I know that people were disappointed when the work transitioned from book to film (I know I was) but just forget that there was a book for five minutes and listen.

Listen to the vampire.

My advice... given the other reviews... don't watch this movie as if it were one of Anne Rice's books brought to movie. It's a disservice to all.

As to the movie: I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love the tension and chemistry between Lestat and Jesse. Very well done. I think  Townsend and the actress who played Jesse carried off their roles quite well.  As to Aliyah (forgive spelling) ..I really did not like her in the role of Akasha.

I think it's interesting how the movie tried to bring together the coming out of vampires into the human race. A human race that appears to be enthralled and yet scared of the mix of the two beings. It turns out that some of the vampires feel the same way as well.  This brings an interesting moment to the concert scene. It's the moment that shows a human race of concert goers the violence and the passion of the vampires. Mind you... they were open about their violence.

It is an interesting movie. The chemistry is good, the effects are good, the music is good, the acting is pretty good, the story from many points is good. Just you probably shouldn't expect it to be like the book. But isn't that usually the way of it?",1114905600,,1364,4.30078125

Marius BARELY played a part in the real Queen of the Damned. Akasha had trapped him, and he never was at the concert. Hell, none of Lestat's buddies were there except Louis. The vampires also attacked AFTER the concert... And Jesse was made a vampire by Mahaeret. Mahaeret also had a twin sister named Mekare, who was the queen of the damned at the end of the novel. NOT Mahaeret. They screwed everything up! Everyone's apperances, (Lestat and Marius were both blonde, not brunette), all the major events, and just the entire movie was wrong. All wrong...

So that pisses them off towards him. Then the 3rd book is thrown into the movie on top of The Vampire Lestat book and it doesn't work.

This movie has no right tying themselves to Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned novel because they totally changed the story around. Characters from the novel were not there, most of the plot was not there, and furthermore, most of the authentencity was not there whatsoever. Did these people even read the novel like they should have? Have they ever even heard of Anne Rice before? I believe if they did they would realize Anne Rice's novels were not written to be a cheesy vampire thriller like all of these lame vampire films being made nowadays. This movie had nothing like was presented in Anne's novels. I hardly recognized the story in the film to what I had read in the novel and this really burns me up. When you adapt a novel to the film you are supposed to be as accurate as possible- it seemed like these people didn't even care, they were just looking for a quick buck and decided that they would get major money off an author whos books sell well and pulled Queen of the Damned from the pile and fooled us the readers into going to the movie. They knew all the people that would come to see the film so what did they assume that they didn't need to work hard at it? They knew they would get their money so what did it matter? I sincerely hope that's not true but I do get the inkling that's exactly what they thought.
Oh all of the mistakes in this film. How about the ole Marius transforming Lestat? Where the heck did that come from? And when did Marius have short brown hair? And where was Mekare- you know the sister of Maharet and one of the most important characters in the entire novel? And what was with the ending? Why is it so different? Why did they totally turn this novel upside down and why did they ignore so many of the characters and scenes and a massive chunk of the plot? Why, why, why? I don't know, I just do not know. And the actors were nothing special either. Maharet was a bore and Lestat held no magic as he did in Interview with the Vampire. Armand looked weird and if they had not called him by name I would never had recognized Marius in the film. I can not compliment nothing in this film.
True, it is just a film, and it is not the end of anyone's life that this film stunk big time, but you cannot help we Chronicle readers growing a little sensitive over this. This film I thought would be as gorgeous and profound as Interview with the Vampire was done and yet it wasn't even near to Interview's beauty. Queen of the Damned was made from a best- selling novel to a cheesy vampire thriller that wouldn't have even made it to the theaters if it hadn't been attached to a famous author's story. Hopefully one day it will be remade, but until then I recommend watching the movie Interview with the Vampire or reading the book Queen of the Damned instead.",1112486400,2,2888,4.281535648994516
1734156,1,B000069I5V,"So the other night i finished watching Interview with the Vampire - a film i love - and i'm left wondering what happens to Lestat? Well sure i could read the books but, i heard that Interview was faithful to the book in many respects so why shouldn't Queen of the Damned? Faithful to the book or not - reading from other reviews it's not - this movie Sucked . . .pardon the pun.

Stuart Townsed really makes for a poor Tom Cruise, i mean Tommy just carried a cool with him in the role which Stuart lacks but makes up for in . . .(?)

And i must say, the music in this movie is also exceptionally bad, granted it's meant for goths to listen to, but given the highyly unlikley event of a vamprie claiming superstardom, would ever make him bigger than Elvis, i mean honestly let's give the devil his due. Boring medicore thumping and growling, the only relief we have from this musically is Lestat going crazy on a fiddle, which in my opinion is what he should have whipped out on stage rather than his bandmates.

Like i said i didn't read the book, yet, but, from watching Interview you can see the large discrepncies in the scripts. In Interview lestat states ""My Maker taught me nothing."" Where as here we have a reltaionship between maker and made almost trying to mirror the relationship between Lestat and Louis as in Interview, poorly made if i do say so myself. The worst job done by anyone in this film though is given credit to soley Aliyah. I mean she's dead and we're supposed to play nice et all, but come on i've seen better acting from muppets.

All in all this movie is bad. Bad,bad,bad,bad, i've seen school productions of My Fair Lady that blow this hunk of **** clear outta the water.

Queen of the Damned is a good-sized book, and a lot from the Vampire Lestat and even Interview with the Vampire would have to be incorporated for a lot of stuff to make sense, and Hollywood doesn't have that kind of time.

As for the movie, it could've done with a lot more explanation, Akasha's killing spree and the ancients turning against her took a total of two or three scenes, and most of the book was lost there. The special effects and acting were good (Alliya wasn't *that* bad), and if you like rock or metal, you'd probably be entertained by the music alone, and the DVD includes special music videos of Lestat's songs, writting and performed by members of Korn, Linkin' Park, Static-X, Disturbed and others.",1111276800,2,894,4.552795031055901

Spanning centuries of History, the story of the red-headed twins and their encounter with the self-centered Egyptian queen, and the origin of all vampires, all the way down to the final battle was an intense maelstorm of events.  To put that into one movie...impossible.  Anne Rice should have put her energy into a mini-series or at least had faith in her fans to do what Peter Jackson did with LOTR. I was disappointed in the movie. Why did I buy the DVD?  I liked the romantic interplay between Jesse and Lestat! Yes most of the movie had nothing to do with the book, but I found that in the movie Lestat's character went beyond the shallow Tom Cruise portrayal.  And I loved the soundtrack.

The movie is truly horrible, not just because it butchers the book, but because it deletes all the explanations for everything so there are 10 mile holes in the plot.  The movie never explains why Akasha goes around killing.  It makes her just look kill crazy whereas in the book there was a definate philosophy behind her actions.  It never explains who the King and Queen are or where they came from in the first place.  It doesn't explain who the vampires are that gather at the end or why really they are gathering.  The movie is just a bunch of vaguely connected violent scenes that don't make any sense.  Aalyiah is horribly miscast as the Queen.  She spends most of her time walking around with a menacing look on her face.  Otherwise she has no real personality.

1734190,5,B000069I5V,"I personally think that 'Queen Of The Damned' is a really good, enjoyable film. I can understand why most people are giving it crap reviews, and I'm pretty sure it's because of the script. If anyone has ever read the actual book, they would be stunned to find out how little of it there is in the film, and how many mistakes there are.

There is nothing whatsoever to do with the twins or Mekare even, Pandora and Mael do not die in the book, Jesse never visits any vampire clubs or even flies with Lestat, there was nothing about a gypsie girl with the violin, and a lot of other stuff besides.

Obviously they changed some things like the concert being in Death Valley instead of an old-fashioned concert hall because of the use of flamethrowers, as it is said on the dvd, and also the age of David Talbot for film reasons too. (I think it was because of the fact David was made into a vampire so they wouldn't have to cast someone else but I'm not sure.) Also, I thought that Aliyah (spelling?) was a bad choice as Queen Akasha, basically because she couldn't work the corny lines.

However, all this doesn't make a bad film. Maybe even the re-invented script made the film altogether more fun, modern and glossy. I think the part of Jesse Reeves was perfectly cast in the form of the beautiful Marguerite Moreau. She is my favourite character in the film. And I'm sorry Stuart Townsend, but though you did a good job, no one beats Tom Cruise as Lestat.

In case of any confusion as to who the vampires at the end were, they were Pandora, Armand, Khayman and Mael.

1734194,2,B000069I5V,"Well...just let me get the negative out of the way first.  First of all this movie is not true to the book.  I have never seen such a chopped up plot in my life!  Magnus made Lestat, not Marius! Jesse was portrayed as a lovesick waif, not a grad student.  The actual story did not make sense to me. There was just not enough depth in the storyline to satisfy me.  Aaliyah's performance (God bless & RIP!) was so-so, but her character was only in the last 30 minutes! Her sweet personality in real life came through in the acting so she was not as convincing as the evil, deadly Akasha.  Am I wrong, or wasn't her character supposed to be the MOTHER OF ALL VAMPIRES????  Why in the world didn't she put up a bigger fight when the other vampires ganged up on her?!?!??? Why did she make herself so vulnerable by offering Lestat blood in front of the other vamps???  Aw come on now...why was she so stupid?  Lestat was using her!  The movie was not as scary as the trailer made it out to be; it looked like one long MTV video.  Maybe it should have been marketed as a comedy! :-)

Now for the good things....I think Stuart Townsend did a wonderful job portraying Lestat as a rock star...especially during the concert scenes & the bonus videos...the music is dark & brooding.  He did a great job portraying Lestat as an angry vampire tired of the prospect of being alone for eternity.  The fight scene where the vamps rush the stage, a little comic relief there as Lestat just lops off one vamp's head.  I did get a little laugh from Akasha's silly little rampage in the club & the way she just sashayed out the the club as it went up in flames. Vincent Perez did a wonderful job portraying the out of touch Marius.  Overall, this movie could have been better, but it still had it's good points!",1106784000,4,1791,4.317365269461078

The trailer for this film does it no justice, and the amount of negative reviews, plus it seemed as if the whole 'Vampire Chronicles' was raped by these fimmakers, allegedly.
 Now, after finally letting curiosity get the better of me, I finally relented and bought a copy of ""Queen Of The Damned"" on widescreen DVD. I won't bother w/ going into plot and/or characters (except to correct reviewers who think the film made a mistake by opening with Lestat arising from a coffin, and not picking up where ""Interview With The Vampire"" left off. That's because ""Interview"" was LOUIS' story, and this is LESTAT'S story. Reread the novels if you need to, in case you don't believe me. Lestat even declared Louis a great liar about a LOT of what was said in ""Interview""), but I will state that this is the BEST vampire movie ever!! Don't pay attention to other reviews, get this movie and make up your own mind. I'm sure you'll be glad that you did, especially if you're a fan of the 1st three novels by Anne Rice. Sure, some things get left out, but my god it would take a 3-part mini-series just to tell ""The Vampire Lestat"", and another 4 or 6 hours for ""The Queen Of The Damned"". And a large part that was cut was just repetitive stuff to begin with. And, plus, now there's the chance to make an entire film about ""The Legend of the Twins"". That story is not dead (as some reviewers on amazon seem to think). Just because it wasn't in this film doesn't mean it can't be used in another!
The filmakers of ""Queen Of The Damned"" pieced together the most important aspects of the story that connected between two novels and ran with them and made an extraordinary masterpiece! Vive Lestat!! And, the soundtrack by Korn's Jonathan Davis & Marilyn Manson is AWESOME!! And the dvd is SO loaded w/ bonuses that definetly make this a very worthwhile investment!

Beyond that, the film is too empty and devoid of any emotion or substance. Stuart Townsend delivers a decent performance, but again not anything exceedingly impressive. The real standout is, obviously, Aaliyah in the title role, but the late singer (who died during production in a 2001 plane crash) doesn't appear until a good hour into the film. She doesn't do much acting- plenty of sexy moving, devilish looks- but she still manages to steal the film (which poses a problem right there).

The only thing I want to point out is that as an Anne Rice fan, I'm not so much outraged at the incredible lack of similarities between the movie and the book as I am sorrowful in knowing I will never see this beautiful story told on-screen the way it deserves.

I feel loss when I think of this movie, because I will never see Lestat portrayed as his true self: blonde, gorgeous, witty, full of himself . . . adorable.

I'll never see accurate portrayals of the characters I love so much.

I will never feel the emotion of watching as Maharet sees her long lost sister for the first time in thousands of years as Mekare finally comes to fulfill her curse on Akasha.

And to see The Legend of the Twins unfold on-sceen . . . sigh.

No, I didn't like the movie, but mostly my heart weeps for what could have been. They could have made million off this story - made it a Great movie deserving of an oscar nomination. Instead they settled for mediocre, and The Queen of the Damned will go down in history as just another vamp flick when it could have been a Masterpiece.

I'm gave this movie 3 stars, but here is my real opinion.

1734209,5,B000069I5V,"First off let me just say that if you're going into this movie as an avid Anne Rice fan and looking for something that completely, or at least for the most part, coinsides with the novel, you will not enjoy this film. Now, if you go into this movie with an open mind and just see it for what it is, a movie, then you should enjoy it. I saw this movie when it was first released with my brother and we both enjoyed it, I probably more than him. Aaliyah fans are not going to see her much as she does not appear in the film until 45-50 minutes into it and doesn't have much staying power even though the movie and promos say otherwise. With the little part she has in the movie, she does it almost flawlessly. Stuart is one of the modern actors I truly enjoy watching and you're going to see an almost complete opposite in his role as Lestat than that of Tom Cruise's portrayal in Interview...

The score to this film is amazingly done by Jonathan Davis (of Korn) and Richard Gibbs. It's haunting and enjoyable enough to hear over and over without annoyance. The movie could have been done a lot better with more time and a better director but for what it is, I love it. It's one of my top 25 favorite movies of all time for the simple reason that I can enjoy every moment of it and watch it outside of what most Rice fans will. It's not a good portrayal of the book and that's the reasoning why most Rice fans are so quick to pass the movie off but out of the context of the Rice novel, it simply is a great film.",1101254400,7,1512,4.090909090909091

Aaliyah did okay and the actress playing Jesse was respectable but in all other ways it was ghastly. Well, there was one good scene: Lestat and Marius admit the power of Elvis. That's it and since this was a good scene I'm betting it got into the final cut by accident.",1100995200,2,392,4.383561643835616
1734211,5,B000069I5V,"Boy we are very critical of this film aren't we?

Since when has Hollywood ever followed the plot in a book?  I know of only one film where they even remotely followed the book's plot so the fact that the Queen of the Dammed didn't even begin to follow the storyline of Anne's Rice's book should not surprise anyone in the whole wide world!

Okay, with that cleared up I have to say I liked the film!  I liked all the actors; they were a credit to the roles they played with Stuart Townsend coming across very well as the tormented yet truculent vampire Lestat and David Talbot played by Paul McGann was really good as the man uneasy in the presence of vampires but drawn to them all the same.

The Queen of the Damned is play by the late singer Aaliyah and I was surprised at how good she was, I wasn't expecting much but she did the role credit despite what other critics have said and I liked the idea of a Vampire becoming a rock superstar whose links to the Queen of the Damned are through his music and his drinking of her blood, a novel idea in my opinion.

Akasha the Queen of the Damned is the mother of all Vampires, she knows no restraint, she will drink the world dry of mortal and immortal blood, she is sensual, she is a demon, she is blood lust all rolled into one violent and burning package and Lestat has awakened her and she wants to turn the world into her own little feast fest but she wants a King at her side and Lestat is going to be that King.

Bring into the world of the Vampire and mortals Jesse played by the able actress Marguerite Moreau whose ties to the Vampire world is through an ancestor who before being made had born a child, and had watched over that child's descendents through the ages, add to that other Vampires, cruel, sensual, wicked, avaricious but occasionally compassionate and you have a heady tale of love, lust, desire, music and lashings of blood and pain.

Good special effects, and a great sound track, all in all a great little horror flick that works well on the small screen!

I quite liked the scene in the film when Jesse offers David immortality, she is now a Vampire herself and Lestat's consort but David hurriedly refuses, he likes his mortal ties.  However the Vampire Marius who made Lestat, played wonderfully by the delicious Vincent Perez has other ideas, Lestat is now with Jesse and Marius has his eye on David.  The film ends with Marius going into the library where David is alone and we know he is going to force David to become a Vampire!  A wonderfully ironic ending if there ever was one.

My only regret is I didn't see this film on the big screen but it transfer to DVD quite well and it is a very enjoyable watch for those who love Vampire stories with more throat than gore.",1100736000,3,2754,4.334630350194552

1734213,2,B000069I5V,"Being a huge Anne Rice fan, I looked forward to this film so much that it was embarrassing. When I heard that this film was going into production, I imagined that this was going to be like ""Interview with the Vampire,"" which was an elegant film that hit all the right notes. It had great direction, the DP was spot on,  and all the necessary parts were adapted from the book.

This film starts off OK. For the first few seconds, a great gothic song plays as the visuals are languidly revealed. Then: Lestat starts speaking. I am not familiar with Stuart Townsend's work; maybe he's a great actor, who knows. But it doesn't show here. He's clearly miscast for more reasons than one. This is beyond the fact that those in charge changed Lestat's hair color because Townsend just didn't look right with blonde hair. Under normal circumstances, this little physical detail wouldn't be such a big deal. However, Lestat's blonde hair is inextricable from the character himself. When most people think of Marilyn Monroe, they think of her as a blonde. She's just not Bombshell Marilyn without it. The same thing applies to Lestat. Aside from this, Townsend's acting barely passes. Quite frankly, he looks bored throughout the film. He lacks the subtlety and finesse to play Lestat. Instead of going without an accent, which would have been a much better choice given the circumstances, Townsend decided to adopt a nebulous, pseudo-sophisticated one -- one he figured would sound cool coming out of the mouth of a vampire. Good thing that Tom Cruise decided not to do an accent for ""Interview."" Townsend's accent is too distracting. This recalls Antonio Banderas' Latino accent in the role of Armand. Although this was completely off in terms of keeping with the book (Armand is a young Russian boy), Banderas embraced the role and made it his own. In my opinion, if you're going to deviate from the book, at least throw yourself into the role and try to be so good at being whatever new character you've become that the audience won't care you're ignoring how it's supposed to be. Hardly any of the characters do this in ""Queen.""

Vincent Perez does the best he can in the role. As Marius, he's one of the least annoying parts of the film because he seems to handle all of this campiness quite naturally. Marguerite Moreau, who in real life is genuinely interested in vampires, also fares pretty well as the vamp-seeking Jesse. There is really no way for me to judge Aalyia's acting -- the strange costume, the stiff, Egyptian-like dance moves and mannerisms she was told to do -- all of this smacks of poor direction. The actors never truly assume their roles; instead, they act out caricatures. It is as if the director went around and went, ""OK, you, Townsend, you're Bela Lugosi...only modern, sexier, and French (or something like that, whatever you come up with will be cool with me)...you, Aalyia, you're like, Egyptian, so you're gonna bellydance your way through this and act all, um, Egyptian, whatever that means.""

Michael Rymer is not a big-time Hollywood director, and it certainly isn't necessary for a person to be one in order to create a competent adaptation. The big problem is, and this is confirmed in a chat with him, he has absolutely no interest in the subject. For him, this film was a fun thing to do in between ""real"" jobs. His objective was to create a film that would appeal to angst-ridden goth teens, thereby making a quick buck at the box office.

In spite of all this negativity, there are some good points. The soundtrack, largely created by Jonathan Davis of Korn, sets the appropriate mood for the film (but it might not be what those who adhere to the book might expect). Lestat's '80s sound receives an update and is replaced by the type of music performed by Marilyn Manson and Disturbed. Both the soundtrack and the score are well worth the listen. Also, a few scenes are memorable and quite well-done (the scenes with the musicians on the beach and the doomed groupies), almost reminicent of ""Interview,"" although this can be a misleading statement; perhaps some scenes were simply not as awful as some others.

The audience I sat with laughed throughout the film at parts that were not meant to be funny. Campy works in many cases. But I think that Anne Rice deserves much better, and that many fans, given their longtime devotion, deserve a film that have experienced directors and screenwriter(s) on board. Anne's books are lush, filled with extraordinary detail and atmosphere; adaptatons should recreate that same feeling on screen. This film had a limited budjet, and many scenes in it scream, ""We are on a budget!""

For reasons most fans know already, this film was rushed...and it shows. Painfully. The sets look cheap, the costumes out of some second-rate costume shop one visits for Halloween, the make-up sloppy and caked-on, the dialogue poorly written and delivered, and the special effects are laughable. ""Interview"" was a carefully woven tapestry, conjuring up images of things gilded, ornate, Old World. ""Queen"" is like one of those made-for-TV movies that pop up every year around Halloween. It is the perfect film to satisfy that need to see something mind-numbingly silly for a couple of hours, nothing more. In the end, it fulfills Rymer's shallow objective.

The end result is that you must read the books to understand the movie, but once you have read the books you see how much of a botch the movie really is.

The visual effects and costuming were fantastic however, and if you can forgive the fact that everyone was acting around a mouthful of prosthetics, all of the actors did a wonderful job.

Aaliyah was quite ok as a queen of the vampires, but what I liked the most, was Stuart Townsend's performance. He was a perfect Lestat. I believe that his performance made the movie as it was. I also found the story of the movie really good. I mean, the vampire who comes out of the shadow, because he's tired of living an anonymous life. And then, the fights between the vampires and the look back to where all this started. It's just great. Besides that, the music was also awesome. It really goes with this movie.

1734238,3,B000069I5V,"Queen of the Damned is based upon the books by Anne Rice. It really combines the stories of The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned.

The initial part of the movie is close to the story of Lestat, but it misses on a few minor items, such as his origin, how he met Marius, any mention of his mother, etc. However the character and the story in the first part of the movie feel true to the Lestat of the novel. The music strikes the tone you would have imagined by the words in the novel, and Townsend did a good job in setting the character. The vibe of the early part of the movie fits well with the vibe of the novel, The Vampire Lestat.

The movie falls apart, however, when it starts to merge into the story in the Queen of the Damned, and brings in those main characters. Jesse bears little resemblance to the Jesse in the book, and the same can be said of Akasha, Maharet, and Armand. The richness of the novel is not reflected in the movie.

I believe this would have been better if they had actually split the movie into two separate movies, with a greater development of the characters through both.

1734239,1,B000069I5V,"I have been a fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles since high school, and am also a fan of the movie adaptation of Interview with the Vampire.

This movie, however, is not a part of the Vampire Chronicles. This movie is the worst movie ever.

I was frustrated even before the movie started, when the credits said that the film was 'suggested by' an Anne Rice book. And boy, was it ever. This movie is so far off the plotline of the book that it should not even be affiliated with it.

Among the most infuriating changes: that Marius was Lestat's maker. He was NOT.

That Jessie and Lestat ended up together in the end: they did NOT. Jessie wasn't all that important in the book.

The absense of Maharet's twin sister, Mekare: she became quite important when she destroyed Akasha in the book.

The soundtrack by Korn: Jonathan Davis, the singer of Korn, has a very easy to distinguish voice, and for anyone even mildly familiar with the band, it is easy to tell that Stuart Townsend (Lestat) is lip-synching to his voice.

Now for the positive part; things I liked about this movie: I wasn't all that pissed off about Aaliyah's role in this film. It was pretty decent. And also...uh, OK, that's all.

In the end, they shouldn't have bothered to adapt this story to film if they were just going to ruin it. The book makes a hard story to film; it's broad and complex...so leave it be. It would have been easier to adapt the second book, the Vampire Lestat, and I'm sure if that story would have been taken on by the right people, it could have made a great movie, and sequel.

first off, it had an unbelievable soundtrack that could only be surpassed by the spawn soundtrack. i loved how they entwined the music to follow the movie theme closely. i loved how they did the concert scenes up until the somewhat cheesy battle at the end of the concert.

enough of the music (which was most of the basis of the movie) the history section of the movie was done well (ignoring the book of course). it was interesting how lestat came to terms with his life as a vampire and how he got the interest of akasha. this is where i would have loved to see the book came true in the movie because the king attacks lestat and nearly destroys him, but oh well. i loved watching aaliyah in her last role. kind of ironic that she played as a character that no longer will be.

i also loved how people reacted in this movie as well. it would be just how it is, no one would believe that a vampire would become a rockstar just for the fame. everyone would believe it was a gimmick and after the show was over, it would be done and lestat would fall off the map after a couple of weeks. anything supernatural is obviously recognized as people were drugged.

the special effects could have been done better, but that wasn't the major factor in the storyline. the reason most anne rice fans were mad was because of the conflicts to the books, not to mention to interview with the vampire the movie. subtle contradictions were there, but noticable, so don't try and watch these movies as a set. watch this movie as a single vampire movie, not part of a series then you will probably enjoy it.",1094428800,4,1862,4.251412429378531
1734258,1,B000069I5V,"Literary adaptations are a tricky thing at the best of times, but ""Queen of the Damned"" is to ""Lord of the Rings"" what Ziploc bags are to fine china. Adapted from Anne Rice's novel of the same name, ""Queen"" is overstuffed, flashy, disjointed, and sure to offend Rice's die-hard fans.

The Vampire Lestat is back. Only now Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has awakened and joined a nu-metal band, becoming a universally adored rock star -- and proclaims to the world that he wants vampires to not hide anymore. Needless to say, this proclaimation makes him hotter than ever among humans, but irks his fellow vampires no end.

But his music is more than popular -- it somehow wakes the ancient Egyptian vampire Akasha (Aaliyah), who is the mother (or grandmother, or great-grandmother...) of all vampires. Akasha is incredibly powerful, able to walk out in the sun and burn her enemies alive. And she's besotted with Lestat -- except that he learns that she is more evil and destructive than he dreamed.

Despite being described as a sequel to ""Interview With the Vampire,"" ""Queen"" is a whole different animal. Rather than a sumptuous Old-World look, there's a pyrotechnic MTV look that makes the whole movie look dated already. It certainly doesn't help that the filmmakers also cram in half of Rice's second novel as well as all of her third. It makes the movie feel like it's about to explode.

Forget for a second about whether it was adapted faithfully or not. Instead, note that Scott Abbott's scripting is atrocious. Since Rice reportedly offered to do the script for free, it's a shame that they didn't take her offer -- surely she could've done better than ""Boo!"" ""Boo back!"". And fans of MTV-derived direction will love the handling of it, though director Michael Rymer tries to cover up his lack of talent with flash and fire.

Stuart Townsend (also known as the man who was ALMOST Aragorn) simply bombs as Lestat. He lacks charm, sex appeal, presence and charisma in this role, as if he's overwhelmed by it. The late Aaliyah, on the other hand, has enormous presence even though she's required to basically bellydance her way through the film. Margaret Moreau is unimpressive as Talamasca groupie Jesse, although she fares better than Townsend.

The second big-screen Anne Rice flick is a textbook example of how NOT to adapt a book -- flaccid characters, idiotic scripting and cheap direction. All the blood has been sucked from this ""Queen.""",1093824000,84,2445,4.865384615384615
1734259,2,B000069I5V,"Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles is a tightly wound, intricately plotted series of three books that should have been filmed ala Lord of the Rings.  To take the third entry and eschew the second, and then to expect an audience to understand it, is pure nonsense.  Although many elements of QUEEN OF THE DAMNED are included in this movie, it makes little sense if you haven't read the books, and for those who have, it is ridiculously lame.  First, Stuart Townsend is absolutely atrocious as Lestat.  He is more like a preening rock star, or an effeminate hairstylist.  He has no presence and does not come close to showing the power that this vampire has, nor the sense of loss in knowing he cannot be mortal again.  Townsend looks frail, and his emotional range is as wide as a bobby pin. Marguerite Moreau fares a little better in the role of Jessie, but playing opposite the limp Townsend, she'd look like Meryl Streep!  Vincent Perez is also ill cast as Marius, he too merely a mirror image of Townsend's Lestat.  Aaliyah is certainly a dynamic screen persona, but given so little to do, she merely dances and struts, with no emotional fulcrum.  Sadly to say, her untimely death robbed her of going on to bigger and much better things than this bomb!

Far more entertaining is the gag reel on the special features, where more emotion and vitality is shown in three minutes than the whole 90 minutes of this miscue.

If I were Anne Rice, I wouldn't sell any more of her rights unless she is more involved and gets a more talented cast and director.",1093392000,2,1548,4.572463768115942
1734260,1,B000069I5V,"Queen of the Damned, shortly, is an ""adaptation"" of Rice's otherwise fabulous third book in her Vampire Chronicles Trilogy (I do not consider the books after Queen of the Damned to be included in the Vampire Chronicles). The story follows the life of a Vampire, Lestat, and the mother of all vampires, Akasha, who wants the world in her hands.

 I didn't watch the film in the theaters, having heard from my friends that they hated it - and most of them have never read the book. But because of pure curiosity, I rented the DVD.

 And what did I see? Purely total dissapointment.

 One of the biggest dissapointments of the movie was the cast. Yes, Stuart Townsend was sexy, he was gothic, he was cat-like...but he wasn't Lestat. In ""Interview with the Vampire"", Tom Cruise brought Lestat to life. He had Lestat's charm and with...he truly protrayed himself as The Brat Prince. Townsend, however, lacked the charisma and charm. He was nothing more than a sex-starved kitten that likes to lure teenage girls into his hands in order to ""feed"" upon them. The fact that the Lestat in ""Queen of the Damned"" was enough for me to hurl the DVD out the window. Lestat fed upon the evil doer - not innocent young girls wanting to have sex with a rockstar. Why the director decided to do this was insane.

 Other actors also added to the dissappointment - Maurius was too flamboyant, too happy for most of the time - and they also hinted at times that he was evil - even though he wasn't. Other actors were hardly in the movie long enough for me to judge on their acting abilities, and sadly, that included Aaliyah as well. The only two characters which I will praise in their acting abilities is the actor that played as David Talbot, and Aaliyah.

 The second dissapointment was the fact that the MOVIE REFUSED TO FOLLOW THE BOOK! Yes, I understand that it is an adaptation. Lord of the Rings, Interview with the Vampire, the Princess Bride, and Harry Potter are also adaptations, yet for most of the time, they remained true to the book. True, Arwen did not rescue Frodo and Harry's father didn't play as Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but these changes are minor and do not affect the story as a whole. Yet, in Queen of the Damned, the changes are so large that they destroyed the entire book. Jesse played in the role which should have rightfully been Louis's, Maharet's twin was gone and she played a signficant role to the entire story, Marius was not Lestat's maker, and Daniel, who played such an important role in the book was missing along with Louis. Jesse became Lestat's lover, even though in the story, they only exchanged a few words between each other, and nothing more. The protrayal of vampires being androgynous creatures that did not care for sex yet are able to sensuously interact with other vampires and humans of either sex is also thrown out the window along with all the emotions that the entire story is suppose to evoke in all of us. Akasha's philosophy was gone, Marius's philosphy was gone, and the tragedy and pain was also gone. Without the pain, the tragedy, and the philosphy, the movie became nothing.

 Instead, all we get is a shallow-minded movie with a plot that a three-year old could follow. I could understand why this movie would easily appeal to the gothic teenager with Townsend's sexy attitude and how the whole romantic story caught up with Jesse sacrifcing her life for Lestat and how he turned her into a vampire at the end to save her life. Although it's a nice idea, it was nothing even close to what the true story of Queen of the Damned is...and because of this, all you get is a shallow b-grade chick flick with bad morals, bad philosophy, bad acting, bad effects, and a bad story. A pure insult to Rice and Rice's fans...",1093046400,11,3777,4.579259259259259
1734261,1,B000069I5V,"When ""Interview With A Vampire"" was about to go into production, Anne Rice was right there, supervising and making her opinions known. Tom Cruise might never have played Lestat if she had had her way initially, which would have been tragic. However, in the end, not only was Rice pleased, but so were the rest of her fans.

Where was Anne Rice when this fiasco went into production? For one, Lestat in this movie, played by someone who really doesn't matter, stunk. He lacked all of the finesse and style that Cruise put into the role, making Lestat a lackluster character in this feature.

Aliyah turns out a suprisingly decent performance (her last), but she was never a strong enough actress to carry a movie and could not be expected to save this idiotic film.

The characters we come to know and love in the books are completely compromised. Quite frankly, if they were going to consolidate and change so much of the original story, they should have just scrapped the project, or taken the time to do something more along the lines of ""Lord of the Rings"", splitting up the movies in order to make them more true to the books.

That's not the point, though. The point is that it's good action, it has a good noir feel, and that Aaliyah was about the hottest thing that ever hit the screen. In fact, the clean lines of her feline, much-exposed self barely fit the jagged grunge of the rest of the movie. That's the movie's problem, not hers.

Three stars for the movie as a whole, but one more for Aaliyah. She was sorely under-utilized in this film, and it's sad to know that we won't see more of her.

1734264,1,B000069I5V,"I was finally able to see this film. I enjoyed the first film dealing with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Neil Jordan's Interview with a Vampire was a very good adaptation of the book of the same title. I knew going in that Queen of the Damned wouldn't have the same pedigree that Jordan's film had, but at least I thought the film would be entertaining in the least. I was so very wrong. The only thing good to say about Queen of the Damned was that Stuart Townsend made a better and more believable Lestat than Tom Cruise. Aaliyah's portrayal of Akashe, Mother of All Vampires, was adequate and didn't really ruin the character for me. It's just a shame that the final film project she was in was this one. She had charisma and talent that hinted at stardom in the film industry. Queen of the Damned is the kind of film that helps perpetuate that camp and cheesiness of the neo-goth and punk vampire scene. This film butchered the story it was based on and other than Townsend every other character in the film were as hollow and empty as cardboard cutouts. Its better to just read Queen of the Damned than watch this film adaptation.",1091404800,3,1140,4.45933014354067

(Louis didn't know at the time that Toms family was pretty much wiped out and actually was minor nobility and Louis didn't understand until much later Lestats loneliness nor how Lestat had protected him. He also didn't know then that all of Lestats kills even then were justice and not indiscriminate)Tom Cruise came across as a vicious prankster.
Although Interview was very sumptuous visually, Tom Cruises portrayal ruined the movie for me.
Townsons portrayal was much more accurate, dangerous,danger loving and sexual at the same time. The only thing really amiss in the characterization is that Lestat can be very introspective though never to the degree Louis is(well he came pretty close in M the Devil.)  Also I thought the MTV video type action was  quite in keeping with the tone of the book.
What was totally frustrating was the ending.  The movie departed so much from the book and made such a mess of the characters that you would have a hard time relating to the remaining books if Queen the movie was your only reference.",1090022400,2,1196,4.758454106280193

I noticed quite a few inconsistancies between The Vampire Lestat/Queen of the Damned books and the movie Queen of the Damned. There were many things not only wrongly stated, but left out and improperly portrayed compared to the book. As previously stated, however, we must look at this movie just for what it is...A movie. As a movie, it displayed amazing visual effects, body-moving music that appeals to a much younger crowd than Interview with the Vampire (I adored that movie by the way) and an erapturing cast that had me pulled in every direction their character went.

I Personally think that if they had put more violence in the movie it would have gotten higher ratings.  I am not really fond of Stuart Townsend but i am glad they used him instead of Tom Cruise.  They should have put Maharet's sister in the movie and they should of put Akasha showing Lestat the supposed cruelties of the world.  They shouldn't have skipped around so much.  I like Aaliyah's elaborate costumes. They look good on her.  They should have mentioned the other vampire's names you don't know who is who.

I am a huge Anne Rice/Vampire chronicles fan, and this movie makes the book seem awful.  The queen of the damned is my favorite title from the whole series, probably because of the history that it gives you on Anne Rice's vampires.  Where the hell is the history in the movie?  There may be SOME history in the movie, but it's not even correct.  And I disagree with others....I don't even think this movie is enjoyable at all.  Even when looking at it from a neutral standpoint, trying to forget that I have read the wonderful piece of literature that is the book,  I still think the movie is awful.  Bad acting, poor plot, it's too fast, the ending was too quick, and too cheap, hell, the whole movie seemed cheap.  I think it should've been released straight to video and stuck on the shelves with all the other poorly made B vampire movies.  You wanna watch a good vampire movie?

1734290,2,B000069I5V,"I am a pretty big fan of Anne Rice and her characters, so I was incredibly excited when I finally got to see this movie.  ""The Queen of the Damned"" had been my second favorite of the Vampire Chronicles, ""The Vampire Lestat"" being my first.  I thought adapting this book would be a difficult, if not impossible, task for any filmmaker.  Oh, how I wish I had been wrong.
Here are a few reasons this film in no way lives up to my hopes as a fan of the Vampire Chronicles:
1.  No real connection to what the book actually describes.  There's a whole freaking lot of information in the book, granted, but I think trying to incorporate the second half of ""The Vampire Lestat"" with this movie, while theoretically a great plan, just doesn't work because there's way too much ground to cover.  You have no clue who the other vampires really are, why Akasha destroys so many, and other such rich and valuable details simply because it's impossible to fit it into a movie-length story.
2.  Casting.  God love Stuart Towsend - he tries, but he just isn't Lestat.  I thought David should have been older and more distinguished, the other ancient vampires should have been more ethereal and beautiful (rather than creepy), and Akasha should have been more, I don't know, believable?  I know, I know, Aaliyah's deceased and I'm not supposed to give her bad reviews, but I can't help it.  Very little of the acting throughout the film was any good.
3.  Deleted scenes.  Um, hello?  So much would have been better about this movie if they hadn't cut the scenes they did.
4.  Johnathan Davis's voice coming out of Stuart Townsend's body.  Just not cool, man.
5.  Special effects.  Cheeseball city.
6.  The ending.  How about, ""no,"" Scottie?
I give this movie 2 stars because it really is a good story, thanks only to Anne Rice, not the filmmakers.  In short, if you really care about this book and the characters, I'm not too sure you'd like this movie.  If you do, hey, that's great, but it just isn't what I expected.

(so hot) Although I liked Interview way better, I thought Stuart played a better Lestat. I think with this movie, they were trying to get to the younger 13 year old audiences rather than adults. They tried to make it more popular it seems and more into the trendy vampires rather then the classics. ... But the soundtrack is awesome! Watch it.",1087862400,2,577,4.504761904761905
1734292,1,B000069I5V,"this movie was meant to be a disaster. To begin with,did the producers or the director realize that""the queen of the damned"" is part of the vampire chronicles?did they realize it would have been more relevant to adapt ""the vampire lestat"" prior to ""the queen of the damned"",to keep some chronological coherence?I suppose they didn't.
So then,here is this movie,based on Anne Rice's novel(you gotta be kidding me).
First,the cast. In ""interview with the vampire"" by Neil Jordan,which is a good adaptation of the eponymous novel as well as an excellent movie,I thought there a big mistake in the cast;indeed Antonio Banderas in the role of Armand wasn't really convincing,nor credible,Armand supposed being around 20 years old when he was made a vampire by Marius.
However,in ""queen of the damned"",the whole cast is a big mistake,a huge joke,with a special mention to vincent perez,ridiculous as Marius. When I first saw ""interview..."",I got the conviction that Tom Cruise Was Lestat,forever. To me,no one could play this character after him. So,to see the long fair haired fugous french young man turning into a dark haired gothic bloke comforts me in my opinion. Aaliyah did a better job than the rest of the cast but still her performance is everything but astonishing.
Then,the screenplay. What can I say?Did you guys really read Anne Rice's novel?If yes,were you sober?So Marius did create Lestat?Well,hum...that's interesting! And what about Armand and Daniel?What about Louis?This screenplay is just a very very poor piece of work,while it should have been the central element of the movie. A fashionable metal rock soundtrack doesn't make a good movie,a great and solid screenplay often does.

Now I consider it fascinating for certain elements, and Stuart Townsend makes a great Lestat, sexy and charming, as well as the accent being more correct.  I love Tom Cruise, but Townsend seems more relaxed as Lestat.  The character of Akasha is almost impossible to play - like casting Helen of Troy, you can't please everyone.  But the actress gains a lot of sympathy for her death before film's release.  I found many elements of the film - including Akasha - to be more campy than dramatic.  The producer & director pay a lot of lip service to fans' complaints during their commentary track, basically making excuses for themselves, leading me to believe they really wanted to make their own vampire-is-modern-rock-star film but were stuck cashing in on the Anne Rice association.  For example, one of the biggest complaints about the Lestat in this film, that he preys upon groupies.  In the books he only preys upon evildoers (and he can read their minds to determine such).  The producer and director threw out Lestat's being able to read minds entirely, and say only that Lestat's morality is basically an inconvenience to them, so they choose not to believe in it.  So treat the books and film completely separately and you should have a good time.  The deleted scenes and Lestat music videos are a bonus.",1086566400,2,1414,4.703252032520325

So that when it was time to kill Akasha, we wouldn't see it as Aaliyah dying.. that's some BS. besides the fact that damn Akasha sort of burns to death (you gotta see it my way), and that she's not even in the movie 45 minutes, I have to say disappointment is not even the word. My girl represented her role though. it was nice to see Aaliyah in that stretch of a role. far different from herself, or her other role in Romeo Must Die. She did an awesome job at being evil. The bar scene was bad-ass, don't front. But I just wish she was in the movie longer. I think the movie should have been called ""lestat's perrils"" or something other than Queen of the Damned. Why hint like the Queen would be there longer than 32 minutes? Normally when a movie is named after a person, that person is in the movie for much longer. It's a little shady on the part of Warner Brothers and Rymer and them. I almost buy into the rumor that it was gonna go straight to video until Aaliyah died.

I'd like to have seen more screen time for the Ancients, but I understand why so many characters and scenes and backstory were cut out - because there's no way the complexity of the book could have been brought to the screen in its entirety, in only one brief film.  It was necessary to condense.  And it worked well enough.",1084579200,4,845,4.412903225806452
1734310,4,B000069I5V,"I finally saw Queen of the Damned at someone's recommendation.  If she hadn't recommended it, I never would have rented it.  I'm glad I did; I really liked it.  Aaliyah was amazing as Akasha.  All I could think was that is was such a tragedy and a great loss for her to die when her career was just beginning.  She was amazing.  And I also thought it was pretty creepy that she died so soon after she played the queen of the undead . . . gives me chills.
The story is good, and the captivating nightime cinematography pulls you into a world where vampires walk among humans.  The great soundtrack should send Goths rushing to the store in a frenzy.
I do think the movie was too long.  I would have gone nuts sitting through it in a theater unless I had been forewarned about the length.  Parts of it are too slow-moving.  Stuart Townsend as Lestat did the best he could with the character, but unlike Interview With the Vampire, Lestat in ""Queen"" is written as a secondary character to Akasha, although he has much more screen time than she does.  But when Akasha comes on screen, she is mesmerizing, and it is worth the wait.  The actor who played Marius, Lestat's sire, is the best male actor in the movie, and steals the show when he is onscreen with Townsend.",1084406400,2,1263,4.373390557939914

I was so disappointed. Anne Rice did the screenplay for Interview and it was very well adapted to a movie. Anne Rice did not do the screenplay for Queen and it really shows. The book was far better. I only gave this 2 stars because I know people who have never read the books and they liked the movie. I suppose for them it was good. For me this movie totally destroyed a very exciting story. Queen is one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles. I just wish the movie had done a better job of telling the story.,1083283200,3,688,4.180451127819549

Hell, it was even like the Aksaha in the book! They storyline is all mashed together and ... MARIUS is NOT Lestat's sire and that is NOT how Lestat learned to play the violin. They should have taken the time and made two movies and cultivated the story. I do think Stuart Townsend made a wonderful Lestat and it's too bad he wasn't in Interview with a Vampire because it was Lestat's true age... but... trust me, rent this before you buy it.

But about a year later, just recently, i found this movie laying around and decided to give it another try.  I really like it now.  The whole theme of the movie was very good becuase you really feel for Lestat and all of the other forsaken who must hide in the shadows. The characters are all strange in thier own ways and you can just tell that all of them are holding something.  The strange places at which this film was made also makes for that dark feeling that gets you in the mood, and the movie's odd soundtrack definately provided the final atmospheric touch to even everything out, with music ranging from heavy metal to that odd techno-goth such as in 'redeemer.'  The only complaint i have about this movie is the annoying trailing digital effects they used on all the vampires whenever they moved quickly or flew anywhere. It drove me crazy.  But thats a minor annoyance i guess.  My favorite parts of the movie were the concert scenes, which you can watch in thier entireity if you want, the cool music videos, and the awesome ending with the people blurring everwhere.",1082937600,4,1335,4.394308943089431

Interview With The Vampire, as directed by Neil Jordan, managed to capture the essence of the novel as well as well depict the ever-growing, ever-changing character of Louis as he comes to grips with his newfound existence as an Undead, the love-hate relationship between himself, Lestat (Cruise) and Claudia...and European Vampires vs. American Vampires.  The first movie initially explores the mind of the vampires, their struggles, their tribulations, their trials, their punishment, their feelings of longing, of regret, and more importantly their need for love and companionship.  Townsend plays a horrible Lestat, who generally, has a great sense of humor, a vampire of rebellious nature who is a freedom fighter of the superior race: the vampire race.  Queen of the Damned fails to satisfy as a sequel and hopefully in the future someone will better fill the shoes Neil Jordan managed to fulfill so perfectly.  If you are a true Anne Rice fan, a lover of the Undead and have a passion for all things 'goth' this movie will fail to deliver.  Underplayed characters, imperfect settings, horrible plot.

1734316,2,B000069I5V,"Ignore the title. Stretch your imagination to the breaking point. Pretend this film has nothing to do with the Vampire Chronicle books (which it doesn't, but is supposed to). I did and actually found myself enjoying parts of this much as I do your standard Saturday afternoon B-movie or a ripping good MST3K.
One thing I greatly enjoyed was the character of Marius. In fact, I liked him better than the original. Initially, I was intrigued with Marius as he was originally written. Then the author imbued him with all the charm of a funny Uncle Bad Touch and the intrigue vaporized. This Marius is nothing like that character. He has a witty and playful sense of humor and I loved the way he toyed with Giles - I mean David. David too was well played and well rounded and both characters provided welcome relief from the ghastly plotting and performances infecting the rest of this film.
But, aside from the director's indecision as to whether he was doing overblown melodrama or high camp, what was seriously flawed about this effort? What relegated this to the MST3K vault? Editorial decisions. Scenes that were cut because they ""would have made the film too long."" I'm certainly not suggesting their inclusion would have put this in Oscar contention, but they would have worked wonders for continuity and clarification.
Lestat's entire backstory for instance. Too long. Unnecessary. Cut it and put it in the ""bonus materials"" section. More fascinating still perhaps, as someone mentioned, was the sudden and unexplained appearance of The Ancients. Who were they? Where did they come from? Where did they fit into this? Apparently the explanation for that too contained too many character profiles and details that would have confused the unwashed masses. Better to just throw them into the mix and leave everybody guessing as to who they were and what they were doing there. I'm sure there were more, but it's been some time since I watched this. Talk amongst yourselves.
Hopefully some day someone will try this again. Hopefully that person will have actually read the book and try to stick a little closer to the plotline. Until then, view this movie as a stand alone B-effort that just coincedentally has the same name as a well-known book. You'll sleep better.",1079913600,,2267,4.890909090909091

Queen of the Damned, the film, was absolutely disappointing!!

The only way you should see this movie is if you have never read the book.
The story of the Twins is gone. I had thought that maybe they combined  The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned into one movie since they overlap so much-none of Lestat history so you don't understand in the movie why this gathering is so important to Lestat and Akasha. Why she let these vampires live. The portrayal of Lestat looses all the contriversaial casting of Lestat that Tom Cruise gave it. Despite trepidation and after many viewings Tom Cruise played the Lestat that LOUIS DESCRIBED perfectly. The self doubts that Lestat occasionally describes in himself are never described by Louis.

1734333,4,B000069I5V,"I rented this DVD in spite of reading these reviews and actually enjoyed the movie just as I had enjoyed Interviewed with the Vampire a few years ago. Stuart Townsend and AAliyah where great together in this sexy, dark, and slightly gory movie. Aaliyah was an up and coming actress but even so did a fantastic job as the lovely but evil, murdering, Queen of the Damned (Very Hot). Someone mentioned how she looked into the camera the entire time in one of the reviews and yet I only counted 1 time and when the shot called for it.

I enjoyed this movie so well infact that I purchased this DVD and am now a fan of the Author Anne Rice even more.

Since I am a movie lover, I have realized the reality that you just can not expect Hollywood to follow the author's story line- chapter-by-chapter in a 2 hour timeframe. It is just not

allowed for. This is also why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I feel that more could have been added to give the story line more dept & detail but time just would not allow for everything. For example, I would have liked to have learned more about the 'Ancient' Vampires in the beginning.

1734335,2,B000069I5V,"Loved both Lord of the Ring and the Vampire Chronicles. The problem with Queen of the Damned is that it captured not the heart or soul of the books and the end product is like an extended MTV.  I am not sure if QOTD has higher budget or IWTV, but clearly much money is spent on the special effects for QOTD. Actually, IWTV has much more passion than QOTD and Neil Jordon captured the essence of the book, like the love-hate relationship between Lestat, Louie and Claudia, the comparison between Louie (one with modern heart) & the old clan in theatre (those who are left behind by the world), the despair of death vs despair of undead.  Everything is taken out from QOTD. All we see is Lestat as a bored vampire who tries to have some fun as a singer, Akasha became an all-evil, blood thirsty vampire who tries to dominate the world but got killed because she lust after a handsome boy and Maharet & other oldies acting like 'Pink Ranger' saving the world.
Budget has nothing to do with it. TV series like ""Angel"". ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer' are low budget and yet very well-made and deeply thought provoking.  The producers and writers are just too lazy or powerless to collect the right materials in the book for the film. In the present form, QOTD is a film with too many actions but too little reasons.  Unlike LOTR films which runs 3 hours each, QOTD has plenty of screentime to add a few dialogues to clear things up, establish the purpose their actions.

1734349,2,B000069I5V,"I just saw this awful excuse for a movie, and I am going to try my best to keep others from making my mistake!
I have loved Anne Rice since shortly after Interview With A Vampire (the movie) came out.  Tom Cruise's portrayal of Lestat, in particular, drew me into the story.  Now, true, the character Louis was hard to get behind (accurate to the book; Louis IS kind of a whiner) and Antonio Banderas, though he portrayed Armand beautifully, was physically inappropriate for the role, and the end was a major departure from the book, but the movie held true to the general plot and personalities and feel of Anne Rice's world.
Not so with Queen of the Damned.  It seems like the scriptwriters barely gave a nod to the plot; they borrowed the names of characters, but didn't even bother with their actual personalities.
Lestat is a vampire.  A self-proclaimed monster.  He's not a nice guy.  But he also drinks only the blood of the evil doer.  I wouldn't call the poor girls he was chasing around in the movie evil doers.  And Lestat is in love with humanity.  Not just Jesse; he loves the members of his band, he loves David, he loves humans he comes into contact with.  Humanity fascinates him
As a note, I do think that with a better script, and a better idea of what he was doing, Stuart Townsend might have been as good a Lestat as Tom Cruise; maybe even better.  But for all of you teenyboppers out there who JUST LOVE STUART TOWNSEND OMG!!111!!, I'm sorry, but just because an actor is hot doesn't mean that any movie he does is good.  Plus Lestat is blond.  It seems like a silly thing to nitpick, but Anne Rice makes SUCH a big deal about it in her descriptions of him that it is in fact important.  I mean, Tom Cruise dyed HIS hair for the role in Interview, and pulled it off quite well.
Then there's David.  You don't see much of our boy David in the movie, which is ok.  The little we saw of him, he was even well-portrayed.  Except one little thing.  Insiginficant, really, except that it's an essential part of the character.  David is in his 70's.  Hello?!
Then of course, there's Marius.  What did these butchers masquerading as screenwriters do to our lovely artist, our Roman scholar?  They turned him into some sort of ...  villain!  Anyone who has read Vampire Lestat would cringe...  To someone who actually read the book ABOUT Marius, his portrayal was perhaps the most painful of all.  And to clarify a few key plot points related to Marius; he is NOT Lestat's maker.  Teacher, perhaps, friend certainly, but not his maker.  Moreover, Marius was trapped under tons of ice for most of the duration of Queen of the Damned; trapped by Akasha when she escaped so that he would not be able to interfere.
And Akasha...  Aaliyah was great as Akasha.  She was just as I'd pictured her, and the only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of just one.  But, for the record, Akasha and Enkil were not actually statues.  Their skin looked like marble, but not their clothes or eyes or hair or whatever.  They had color, but the morons who wrote the screenplay apparently missed this.
Jesse, along with Maharet and the other ancients, is such a two-dimensional character in this movie I won't even go into them, except to say that it's sad that such characters so essential to the plot were so ignored.  Or, in the case of Mekare, Maharet's twin, not mentioned at all.
Now, a few notes about vampire lore.  In the vampire club, when Jesse goes in looking for Lestat, claiming a relationship with the ancient Marius, one of the vampires tells her all of the ancients are dead.  There is a reason for this belief.  Just before Marius' time, Akasha and Enkil, her king, were dragged out into the sun by their keeper, in a bid to end their existence.  While Akasha and Enkil only acquired a deep tan, because Akasha, who was the mother of ALL vampires, was burned, so every single other vampire was burned.  New vampires were immolated; older vampires didn't die, but existed in agony.  Vampires were nearly wiped out.  Akasha's blood did NOT bequeath Lestat the ability to walk in the sunlight with no fear.  If Akasha had actually walked into the sun, or through the fire, most of the vampiric population would have exploded into flame.
Last of all, worst of all, is the plot.  The scriptwriters took the most insignificant scene and turned it into the bulk of the movie.  Lestat's awakening and discovering of rock music isn't even IN Queen of the Damned, it's in The Vampire Lestat.  Moreover, that and the later battle comprise of perhaps two chapters, one out of each book.  And yet in the movie, it's more than three quarters of the story!  The rich history of the vampires is never touched on, even though it's the bulk of the plot in the book.  It's vaguely mentioned that whoever drinks the last drop of Akasha's blood won't survive, but not why; they don't mention that if Akasha dies, all vampires die.  And where is Mekere, Maharet's dumb (as in, tongue was cut out, not as in stupid) sister, the one who eventually took Akasha's essence into herself?  Where is Akasha's quest to eliminate most men, to elevate women and establish herself as their goddess?  Gone.  Not even touched on.
This was awful.  If you'd never read the book, I can't understand how you could ever follow the plot, and if you did read it, the plot makes you want to rip your own eyes out to make it stop.  Hot actors and flashy special effects are no replacement for vivid storytelling and deep characters.

There were either no computer graphics or they were so well done that you couldn't tell, from what I remember. The characters and plot were intriguing and fascinating, as well as being original and well thought up.
After I read the book, I rewatched the movie, nitpicking every little detail of the film. Thinking why did they take out certain characters and scenes, why it just happens that most of the characters they cut out or remove lines from are bisexual, why they change almost the entire plot, why is it that no one notices that his ""French"" accent is completely fake, and so many other things. It is clear that the book is far better than the movie, with excellent writing, and wonderful characters.

The few who say that Townsend is better than Tom Cruise are completely wrong as Cruise fits into the roll as the Lestat Louis sees in 'Interview with the Vampire'.

They missed out so much that the book offered. The character's like Daniel, Louis and even Mekare (who played a vital part in Anne Rice's 'Queen of the Damned') are missed out completely. They called it a sequal to the brilliant 'Interview with the Vampire' and then missed out Louis which, fans of the better film would be very angry about. Of the characters that did manage to keep their places I can't say much, as most of them only managed a few lines (three for Armand).
There was no explanation to where Vampires came from which is a very important part of the book and the significance of the redheaded twins was never told either.

Maybe that's because I could not see it as a separate thing...I could not view this film without comparing it to the book, which, to be honest, is an impossibility anyway...it is too remote from it.
Stuart Townsend's acting is horrible, the music doesn't quite fit the story and the special effects weren't up to par. And I'm not even going into the story, which was raped so heavily that it's unrecognisable. Apart from that, I didn't even find it enjoyable as a standalone movie.

Physically, he makes the cut but he is nowhere near the performance that Cruise gave in Interview...Tom captured the essence of Lestat and I'm sure there are a lot of people that feel the same way I do.....this film blew for the following reasons:  (1) it is the weakest book from the Vampire Chronicles (Queen of the Damned), (2) the screenplay was shortchanged.....combining two big novels into one was a huge mistake, (3) some of the characters were changed - (i.e. Lestat's creator - Magnus to Marius?), and (4) the way the movie was promoted - Aaliyah's last film attracted the kiddies that knew nothing of the Vampire chronicles......Oh, well I guess it's all business.....Undoubtedly, the second film should have been the Vampire Lestat with Cruise reprising the role.....the film would have worked by having Lestat tell his story like Louis did in Interview......it would have endeared him to the audience by telling the story of his vampiric life and we would be talking about the next film (Tale of the Body Thief, a much superior book to Queen of the Damned)...let's hope Warner Bros. revitalizes this franchise by redoing this film as the Vampire Lestat and recast Tom Cruise as the one and only Lestat........",1067990400,2,1439,4.970954356846473
1734367,3,B000069I5V,"I know it is the lowest form of irony to complain that a movie about vampires has no life in it, but that is essentially my reaction to ""Queen of the Damned.""  It has been many years since I read Anne Rice's novel, but enough of it came back to me while watching this 2002 film to know what was going on, even if the film was going to be less than helpful in that regard.  Beyond that ""Queen of the Damned"" suffers on pretty much every point of comparison between it and 1994's  ""Interview with the Vampire.""

The premise is that the vampire Lestat (now played by Stuart Townsend), was disenchanted by the world after the experiences covered in ""Interview,"" and took to his crypt for a couple of centuries.  However, the call of goth music brings him back to the real world where he produces to front a successful band and work all of the secrets of the vampires into the lyrics of his songs.  Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a researcher for a vampire study institute in London, has been studying those lyrics and starts tailing Lestat, who has reawakened the title character, Akasha (Aaliyah) with his violin playing, and, of course, upset all of the vampires in the world by betraying them to the world of the living.

If you do not understand how all the vampires in the world are descended from Akasha, and what that blood relationship means for each generation of vampires, then you are going to miss out on a lot of the dramatic conflict in this film.  Fortunately, you are not really involved enough in the plot or the characters to particularly care as the film's sense of lethargy consumes the audience as well.  Townsend captures the arrogant aloofness of a goth music star, but neither the scripts nor the songs provide much help, while Aaliyah is simply too young for the title role.

Ultimately, I am most disappointed by the music.  I manage to like the music of faux-groups in lots of movies, from ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" and ""Light of Day"" to ""Rock Star"" and ""A Mighty Wind.""  But the Nine Inch Nails style music Lestat sings in ""Queen of the Damned"" makes no more of a connection with me than the rest of the film.  There are a few decent special effect shots, including the last one in the film, but I would rather have a better story and more engaging characters, especially when they are dead.",1067817600,,2321,4.523923444976076

The Music ROCKED!I am a big gothic alternative music fan so I Loved it I wish the band the vampire really existed cuz if it did i'd be they're no. 1 fan.
the main reason I Loved this Movie was bcuz of The incredibly hot actor that played Lestat. HE IS SO F%@%ing SEXY!!Especially when he'd be shirtless with those low rise leater pants yummy. I swear when ever i watch this movie (which is quite often)my eyes are locked on lestat the whole time.he gives me this wonderful sexy tingling sensation whenever i c him lol.

1734372,1,B000069I5V,"It is rather difficult to review this movies, as one has to take in all the reasons why this movie was bound to fail miserably. First of all, this is the sequel somewhat to the Interview With the Vampire movie (although the third book in the series). Since the second book of the series (The Vampire Lestat) had not been made into a movie, the producers of this film had to compact two books of history into one movie. That is one reason why the film left out the majority of both books (read the books, by the way). Second of all, this film was sequel to the extremely popular and sucessful Inteview With the Vampire, so naturally, repeating that formula would have been very impossible indeed. One reason for that is that the previous film was cast with some very big stars (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater), while Queen of the Damned was cast with only one: Aalyiah. The rest of the cast was relatively unknown (Stuart Townsend isn't really well known as of now).
All these problems aside, the movie itself is quite horrible. If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed, mainly because much of Rice's rich characterization is lost. None of the vampire's history is revealed, most specifically the Legend of the Twins, which is left totally out. The rest of the vampires are only glimpsed near the end of the movie, and are never referred to by name. Unless you've read the book, you won't be able to tell who's who. Other idiotic point is that the older vampires, for all their short time on screen, dress in the clothing of the era they were made, which is entirely untrue in the book. Something that other's might consider minor is the disappointing lack of physical resemblance the characters have to their counterparts in the books. For example, Marius is described as a man in his forties, with long gray hair, and a beautiful face. Jesse is much older in the book, with very prominent red hair, and the brief appearance of Armand is vastly wrong, because he looks more like Lestat would. The only correct thing about Armand's physical appearance is his age: he is much younger here than in Interview With the Vampire, because the books state Armand was made a vampire when he was 17. The only one who really looked close to his description is Lestat. Stuart Townsend looked very much like my conception of Lestat, though his voice was far too deep. Still, he didn't look as good as Tom Cruise in that part. Physical resemblance is important because vampires are described as being very sensual and beautiful, and the movies suffers for failing to accurately bring those literary characters to movie life.
I won't really start with the inaccuracies with the book; there were far too many. The main liberties taken (besides the absence of the other vampires) were the relationship with Marius and Lestat. Lestat was not made by Marius, as others have pointed out, and Marius as portrayed as something of an evil vampire, when in the book he is Lestat's mentor and he only slays evil men. The ending is wholly different, and impossible to compare and contrast here (read the books).
The main reason I think it failed is that the movie sacrificed a rich story for pop culture refrences. More is made of this movie's soundtrack and Lestat's brief career as a nu-metal star than anything else, even the story. For the reasons I described in the beginning of this review, I do think the filmakers were doomed to repeat the success of Interview With the Vampire, but that is no excuse for not even making an effort. The producers try to make excuses if for, most notably with the cut scenes, where they try to explain why they cut more footage of the other vampires.
In conclusion, Queen of the Damned is a miserable failure, mainly for giving up a rich and thrilling story for pop-culture references. As I have said, it would have been impossible to repeat the success of the former vampire movie, but this movie is just too awful to even stand on it's own.",1060300800,9,3998,4.632394366197183
1734373,2,B000069I5V,"How to write a review without saying what a thousand others haven't before? The fact is that as an adaptation, this is *the worst* I have ever, ever seen. Teenyboppers who proclaim that Neil Jordan's Gothic, stylish (if flawed) Interview With the Vampire is not as good as this because ""Stuart is hoooottt!!!"" should not be listened to.
The script is painful; the dialogue atrocious. It is hard to discern from the acting whether the actors are being over-sincere to the point of parody, or are knowingly taking the mickey out of themselves. The sets are lazy; the ""Mediterranean"" (Australian) beach used in the scenes with Lestat and Marius is the same ""Exotic"" (Australian) beach used in the scenes with Akasha.
I can't even compare this movie to the book, much, because it has absolutely nothing to do with the book, save character names and coincidences like them being vampires. Louis, the main character from this film's predecessor, is absent. The interviewer, Daniel, who played a key role in the book, is absent. The twin who eventually becomes the Queen of the Damned is absent-- an amusing if stupefying omission from a movie named after such a thing. Jesse and Lestat did not have any romance in the book, much less this sub-standard Romeo and Juliet rip-off-- romance in the book was between Lestat and Akasha, and later Lestat and Louis, though the producer has erased this in what is a frankly insulting sop to any homophobic viewers.
As a movie, and nothing else, it is simply a trashy, vapid watch. It resounds with cliches (including a painful Matrix fight-scene imitation) and strange 'assertions'-- ie, vampires walking in sunlight-- as well as laughable mistakes, such as Lestat describing the very American Jesse as ""a British Goth"" or the English ""Talamasca Center"", or even the labelling of ""Western England"", when nowhere in England are you more than seventy miles from the sea, thus negating any need for labelling of West, North and such.
The saving ""grace"" of this movie is the music. Sometimes too loud/too stupid, it also boasts some wonderful background tunes, especially in a bar scene where Tricky's ""Excess"" is played against predatory vampires watching Jesse. I highly recommend you buy the soundtrack-- perhaps rent the film, get some popcorn and treat it as a spoof. Treat it as an adaptation, or even a sequel to the dark, sexy, well-acted ""Interview"" and you will feel both displeased and ripped-off.
I also want to address all the black/white issues that have sprung up over the casting of a black actress. Those who proclaim Akasha to have been black were wrong. Those who proclaim her white are wrong (in the racial sense).
One of the many, many, many things left out in this movie is the story of Akasha's origins. She hailed from a place called Uruk-- which is now part of Iraq-- so she would have been Middle Eastern in appearance. She married the Egyptian king, Enkil, but she was not African. She was not black; she was not white European, so these arguments over casting are negated unless they ever cast an actor from that region in that role.
I'd comment on Aaliyah's acting more fully-- she was good in this film, if her character was scripted as a vapid villian-- but she was in it for all of ten minutes. Manipulative marketing.",1060214400,,3281,4.819148936170213

I think i got to see the movie the best way though. i had lots of background information from the first 2 books only so i didn't have anything in my head going ""That didn't happen. What's this?"" The only thing that i knew didn't really happen was that Marius didn't make Lestat. I think it was a good story plot, though it wasn't close to Anne Rice's book.
The people who made the movie weren't exactly going for everything like the book. it would have been a much, much longer movie. Also, Stewart Townsend was absolutely hot! he gave me chills! especially at the part of the concert. the music was great as well. i highly recomeded the soundtrack for any rock fan.

Tom Cruise portrayl was way better and closer to the novels than Stuart Townsend and he looked more like Lestat.

I do wish that the screenplay was closer to the books than they were, but it wasn't, so I just watched it again like I had never read it... and it was okay. Yes, there were moments the dialog absolutely sucked, but there were parts that I thought were okay. The scene were Lestat and Akasha shared their ""moment"" was sexy!
The actors themselves, Stuart Townsend as Lestat was perfect! Sure he didn't look like the Lestat described beautifully by Anne Rice, but neither did Tom Cruise. It gave Stuart a chance to shine, and I thought with what was presented to him, he did a great job. Aaliyah was pretty good. This was only her 2nd role acting and unfortunately her last, but I still believe she did a pretty good job. As for the other actors, I love Vincent Perez, but not as Marius. That didn't work... nor did the other actors. And completely leaving out Louis was a grave mistake. They portrayed Lestat as if he were alone in the world, when we all knew that simply wasn't the case.
Lastly, the music was SLAMMING! Jonathon Davis, my hats off to you! There isn't one song on the soundtrack I can say I don't like, but I can say ""Slept So Long"" is my favorite song. The music was definitely the biggest and brightest spot of the movie.

1734390,3,B000069I5V,"Queen of the Damned like the other Anne Rice movie to be brought to the screen, Interview with the Vampire, is a movie that its quality is based entirely upon what you came into the movie expecting and what you wanted out of it.  Many people came into the movie hoping to see an adaptation of a book they loved that is in part made great by the multitude of fascinating and intertwined characters along with the story of Lestat and Akasha.  This is not what this movie is.  This movie cut almost all of the characters and many those that they did keep who were favorites with fans including Armand, become mere cardboard cut outs that say a few sentences.  The original story of Lestat is almost unrecognizable from that told in The Vampire Lestat.
Other people, however, who come into the movie looking for a laugh might enjoy this.  Many beloved characters are so twisted and changed that reduce some of the fans who take things lighter to giggles and full out belly laughs.
There is one saving grace to most people who go to see this movie and that is the music.  The songs were written for this movie and are fantastic.  The entire soundtrack of this movie is far superior to the actual movie itself.
If you are willing to go into this movie with a light heart willing to laugh and to appreciate the skill and time that went into the soundtrack of this movie you are likely to find this a highly enjoyable and rather amusing movie.

Those familiar with the novel know it is no short read. I marveled at how a screenwriter could condense such a work into an hour and a half film... but this was before I actually watched it. Many many many important details are left out or neglected in the movie. The title, Queen of the Damned, leads one to believe the movie is about Akasha when really this movie focuses more on Lestat than anything else. We are never told of the origins of the vampire race as we are in Rice's novel (something I feel is very much the heart and point of the work). We are never told the significance of Jesse and Maharet--the ones with the red hair--or of Marahet's sister Mekare. We are never told the stories of those who confront Akasha; in fact, we're never even told that they are the famous Louis (Interview with the Vampire), Pandora, and Ramses (the Mummy). We don't get to see the complex relationships between the characters as well as we do in the novel. And some of what we DO see are twists of the actual plot (such as Marius' character being Lestat's main support when in the novel it was Louis by his side).
Basically, all back information was dropped. This is some times beneficial to the viewer because one can get lost in the many intricate details of Rice's works. However, one can just as easily get lost in the lack of details, which is the main problem with this movie. The story line has so much more to give; I felt [cheated] after watching this version of it.
The one positive thing I can say about this film is the exposure it gives to Stuart Townsend (Lestat) and Marguerite Moreau (Jesse), two wonderful actors who shine through the chaos and dullness of this movie.
For those who were disappointed with this movie, I suggest reading the novel. Don't let the movie ruin this enthralling story for you. Anne Rice is about twenty times better at telling this story than Scott Abbott (the screenplay writer) is. For those of you who have read the book, don't bother with the movie. It will only leave a bitter taste in your mouth and a stone of disappointment in your heart. This movie is an insult to Anne Rice's work. If I were her, I'd sue.",1056844800,,2287,4.447619047619048

Alliah was good but sometimes her preformance was a little off. One thing I did not like about this movie is the BLONDE headed Armand instead of a black haired Armand (As Antonio Banderas played him in Interview). I also didn't like the fact that points with Louis were left out of this movie but...there can always be another sequel.

I have loved Anne Rice since shortly after Interview With A Vampire (the movie) came out.  Tom Cruise's portrayal of Lestat, in particular, drew me into the story.  Now, true, the character Louis was hard to get behind (accurate to the book; Louis IS kind of a whiner) and Antonio Banderas, though he portrayed Armand beautifully, was physically about as inappropriate for the role as possible, and the end was a major departure from the book, but the movie held true to the general plot and personalities and feel of Anne Rice's world.
Not so with Queen of the Damned.  It seems like the scriptwriters barely gave a nod to the plot; they borrowed the names of characters, but didn't even bother with their actual personalities; they took bits and pieces of some of the most insignificant bits of the book, without bothering with what was really important; they inserted ridiculous things that manufactured themselves.
For you who have not read, and probably will not read, Anne Rice, let me clarify a few of the most glaring points for you.  We'll start with Lestat.
Lestat is a vampire.  A self-proclaimed monster.  He's not a nice guy.  But he also drinks only the blood of the evil doer.  I wouldn't call the poor girls he was chasing around in the movie evil doers.  And Lestat is in love with humanity.  Not just Jesse; he loves the members of his band, he loves David, he loves humans he comes into contact with.  Humanity fascinates him.
Oh.  And he can't fly.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but that doesn't happen until AFTER he becomes Akasha's playboy.
As a note, I do think that with a better script, and a better idea of what he was doing, Stuart Townsend might have been as good a Lestat as Tom Cruise; maybe even better.  As it was, he failed hard.
Then there's David.  You don't see much of our boy David in the movie, which is ok.  The little we saw of him, he was even well-portrayed.  Except one little thing.  Insiginficant, really, except that it's an essential part of the character.  David is in his 70's.  Hello?!  The words ""I'm too old"" coming out of that actor's mouth are...  Ridiculous.
Then of course, there's Marius.  What did these butchers masquerading as screenwriters do to our lovely artist, our Roman scholar?  They turned him into some sort of ...  villain!  Anyone who has read Vampire Lestat would cringe...  To someone who actually read the book ABOUT Marius, his portrayal was perhaps the most painful of all.  And to clarify a few key plot points related to Marius; he is NOT Lestat's maker.  Teacher, perhaps, friend certainly, but not his maker.  Moreover, Marius was trapped under tons of ice for most of the duration of Queen of the Damned; trapped by Akasha when she escaped so that he would not be able to interfere.
And Akasha...  Aaliyah was great as Akasha.  She was just as I'd pictured her, and the only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of just one.  But, for the record, Akasha and Enkil were not actually statues.  Their skin looked like marble, but not their clothes or eyes or hair or whatever.  They had color, but the morons who wrote the screenplay apparently missed this.
Jesse, along with Maharet and the other ancients, is such a two-dimensional character in this movie I won't even go into them, except to say that it's sad that such characters so essential to the plot were so ignored.  And when Lestat originally drank from Akasha, it was not Akasha who pushed him away; in fact, he was nearly KILLED by a jealous Enkil, and only just saved by Marius' intervention.
Now, a few notes about vampire lore.  In the vampire club, when Jesse goes in looking for Lestat, claiming a relationship with the ancient Marius, one of the vampires tells her all of the ancients are dead.  There is a reason for this belief.  Just before Marius' time, Akasha and Enkil, her king, were dragged out into the sun by their keeper, in a bid to end their existence.  While Akasha and Enkil only acquired a deep tan, because Akasha, who was the mother of ALL vampires, was burned, so every single other vampire was burned.  New vampires were immolated; older vampires didn't die, but existed in agony.  Their kind was nearly wiped out before the royal pair was dragged from the sun.  Akasha's blood did NOT bequeath Lestat the ability to walk in the sunlight with no fear.  If Akasha had actually walked into the sun, or through the fire, most of the vampiric population would have exploded into flame.  And for Lestat, though after drinking Akasha's blood, sunlight would no longer kill him, it still certainly isn't pleasant.
Last of all, worst of all, is the plot.  The scriptwriters took the most insignificant scene and turned it into the bulk of the movie.  Lestat's awakening and discovering of rock music isn't even IN Queen of the Damned, it's in The Vampire Lestat.  Moreover, that and the later battle comprise of perhaps two chapters, one out of each book.  And yet in the movie, it's more than three quarters of the story!  The rich history of the vampires is never touched on, even though it's the bulk of the plot in the book.  It's vaguely mentioned that whoever drinks the last drop of Akasha's blood won't survive, but not why; they don't mention that if Akasha dies, all vampires die.  And where is Mekere, Maharet's dumb (as in, tongue was cut out, not as in stupid) sister, the one who eventually took Akasha's essence into herself?  Where is Akasha's quest to eliminate most men, to elevate women and establish herself as their goddess?  Gone.  Not even touched on.
Perhaps, if you never read the book, this is a watchable movie.  But flashy special effects and attractive stars are no substitute for the depth of story that a movie like this COULD have had.  Don't waste your time, don't waste your money - don't watch this movie.",1053907200,2,6031,4.594569288389513

1734412,1,B000069I5V,"One thing that separated Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles from the hundreds of vampire drivel out there was her ability to develop deeply-layered characters that we could immediately identify with. Each one from Lestat to Pandora to Marius, had their own inner battles that served as an umbilical cord to their humanity. That along with the rich historic origins of vampirism exquisitely detailed from vampire to vampire, lent an aura of romanticism that few other writers could develop. The book, Queen of the Damned, connected the past with the present and introduced us to the group of immortals who hold the survival of fellow vampires in their hands. Queen of the Damned the movie, on the other hand, is just plain bad. From acting, writing, casting, directing, all facets of this exercise, which in essence is just a music video, utterly and miserably fail.
After years of hibernation, Lestat awakes in the 20th century and decides to ""come clean"" and cause a ruckus as he usually does. This he does by writing an autobiography (the Vampire Lestat) and joining a rock band and thereby announcing to the world the secret of the cabal. This, as you can imagine is not taken lightly by the other bloodsuckers who revel in their nonexistence, living on the fringes of society. The vampire nation decides it's time that Lestat shuts up forever. At the same time, Akasha, literally the mother of all vampires, is also awakened and decides to enforce her vision of utopia on the suspecting world.
Never have I seen such a bland, untalented, and unmotivated group of actors. Stuart Townsend plays a wooden and stiff Lestat who seems bored except when on stage. Aaliyah is truly miscast as Akasha. The scene where she enters a vampire bar is pure comedy. The few actors of substance like Lena Olin, are barely given any screen time. The dialogue is reminiscent of a cartoon. There are far too many vampire bar scenes where fashion attire is the only reason the scenes were shot. Black leather and heavy makeup, this is a good advert for the goth-look but nothing more. Itfs image and style over content and substance. It's no wonder that Anne Rice disassociated herself from it.
There seems to be a slew of directors from the MTV music video school of film making and though some learn enough to eventually make a decent film, the majority are better suited for commercials or even better yet, music videos. As long as it looks good, then it's fine. Eye candy works for a 5 minute music video but not for a 2.0hrs film. I didn't expect them to follow the storyline which is fine but it's clear that they chose this route only to appeal to the younger audiences in the same way they cast Townsend and Aaliyah. Demographically, I don't think the majority of Anne Rice's readers are teenagers. The only positive reviews I read, extol the beauty and looks of Townsend and Aailyah as reasons for liking the movie. Sorry but that's not enough for me and many others. I have made a note of those involved in this fiasco from the director to producers and will avoid anything they are involved in like the bubonic plague.",1053561600,2,3108,4.725598526703499

1734414,4,B000069I5V,"As a huge Rice Fan, I have no qualms with the liberties taken in shortening 2 novels into one movie (face it, there was just too much information to fit in).
I was able to forgive the fact that Lestat was not blonde and Akasha was not white.
I was able to forgive the complete inteference of ""Jesse"" in the movie.
What I cannot get over, WILL NOT FORGIVE, the horrible editing decisions made in this movie.
The fact that they cut out all the scenes which actually gave the characters some depth is AWFUL.
I was not impressed with the movie when I first watched it and actually had a hard keeping time will all the characters introduced at the end (who just got burned up???) then while damming the WB, I decided to look at the extras on the DVD...
DUH!
Who was the nitwit with the editing scissors?
Had the deleted scenes, been left in the movie (especially those involving the elders) the movie would have been SOOOOO much better.
The movie is actually 3 stars, I gave the DVD another star for the extra scenes, because once seeing them,I then understood what they were trying to say!!!
Other comments:
Soundtrack: Great, now Im not a fan of Jonathans, but I really liked his interpretation of the music.
Acting: Townsend was very good, he was sexy, a tease and a pain in the a** all at the same time (I felt that Cruise ruined Lestat in Interview), Aliyah did a really good job,  and so did the character playing Maharet (dunno her name).
I felt Jesse would have been better played by a different, maybe more innocent? character (since thats were the ""new"" Jesse was aimed at). Armand... I concur with another comment, throw a shoe at him... Every one else was impressive (ah Marius, was very good)
Over all, if you can manage to forgive the movie makers liberties, the movie is fun, entertaining and has a nice dark soundtrack (seems to have more effort put into it than the movie)
Extra videos and deleted scenes: Very nice to have placed the TVL videos on the DVD, and once again,WHY??? are those deleted scenes not in the movie?",1052092800,,2034,4.467741935483871

While I did enjoy the fact that Lestat was more up-to-date and modern, I thought that Aaliyah's role as the mother of all vampires, Akasha, would have had more screen time. I was a little disappointed that it took such a long time for her to be on screen, and then before you knew it, she was being killed. I would have loved to have learned more about Akasha, what she was about, how she came to be, etc.
Overall, I would say that this is a pretty good movie, but, to me, it's one that I'll watch once and probably won't watch again.",1050969600,,685,4.119402985074627
1734418,1,B000069I5V,"There are so many things wrong with this big-screen adaptation of my favorite book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  It takes the heart and soul out of the book and becomes nothing more than a standard B-grade horror movie, albeit with a rather HOT SEXY vampire.  The basic premise of the book is to explain the origins of vampirism in Anne Rice's world.  Central to its plot is the legend of the twins - Maharet and Mekare - the persecution and extermination of their people by Akasha, their forced separation, the origins of Maharet's great family, the origins of the Akasha and the other ancient vampires, and Maharet's quest to find her lost twin.  The movie has none of these, and lost the plot as a result.  Maharet's great family tree appears but the viewer gains no real sense of what it is, why it is so important to Maharet, and Jesse's part in it all.  The ancients appear in it, but are not even named, and again the viewer gains no sense of who they are and why they would plot against Akasha.  And if destroying Akasha were as easy as depicted in the movie, one wonders why the ancients haven't done it ages ago.  And whatever happened to Mekare and her demented zig-zagging trek throughout the world in her hunt for Akasha?  Whoever made this movie tried to squeeze two books into one, and came up with something far inferior to the superb first movie, Interview with the Vampire.  I can only hope someone someday does as better and more faithful job at adapting Anne Rice's towering history of the vampires, perhaps as a TV mini-series.",1050278400,3,1554,4.557553956834532
1734419,5,B000069I5V,"I thought this film was a truly great film. Sure lots of people thought it was rubbish, but the reason that was mostly given was because it was different to the book. I haven't read the book (although i assume it's excellent as was interview and the vampire Armand).
While I loved Interview I'm glad Cruise declined to be in this film. Cruise was excellent in Interview but that was because his Lestat funny and cruel all at once (who can forget the scene in which he dances with Claudia's mom's corpse)suited the tone. But in this film Lestat is more edgy and sexy (i know lots will argue that Cruise was very sexy but it's not the same kind of raw sexiness combined with smouldering eyes that Townsend portrays (which certainly made me tingle and wish that i was Jessie).
Aaliyah's performance was good but not as good as it should have been. While she captured Akasha's ruthlessness wonderfully she didn't have the regalness (made up word) that Akasha is sure to have.
The story is about Lestat a vampire who has a big ego (although there is much more to him than just his ego) and after sleeping for many years decides to rise to become a new God, a rock God. There is also Jessie who is a Talamascan (sort of like the watchers council in Buffy but they don't interfere) who believes Lestat is a real vampire rather than a gimmicky rock artist, and even when she finds out the Talamascan already knows she still pursues him (they both have a very strong chemistry that draws you in) and proceeds to fall in love (and lust).
Lestat plans one concert where he plans to awaken Akasha as well as make sure (not that he's bothered much) that the other vampires (ones that aren't keen on him revealing they are real) don't kill him. During this you also get flashbacks of Lestat and Marius (the vampire who made Lestat) as well as him coming in later [upset] at him for revealing the truth and trying to awaken Akasha. I won't spoil the ending all I'll say is it's FAB.
All in all this is a wonderful film and (as I've said before) Stuart Townsend is pure ... as well as being a fabulous Lestat (people get over the fact he isn't blond).Jessie (can't remember her name) is terrific She's slightly naive but feisty. The music on it is haunting, beautiful and hard rock. GO BUY IT.",1049587200,,2277,4.436754176610979

I cannot understand why other reviewers must take a film like this to task with a fine-toothed comb. I go into these films suspending the critical eye and giving myself to the beauty, moods and other visceral impressions tantalized by such work.

1. Acting. Enough ham to supply Jarred with a lifetime supply of Subway subs.
2. Story line. This movie was supposed to be based upon the Anne Rice novel of the same name, right? Even if one dicounts this, the story was disjointed and...what the word...dumb (my kingdom for a thesaurus). The best part of the movie occured when the sound went out for about ten minutes and the people in the theater began making our own dialogue up.
Okay, it was just myself and my friend, but we were pretty much the entire audience.
3. The vampires. There's only one who REALLY bugs me. Its the guy who looks like the drummer for Metallica. I really don't have a reason for not liking him, since he's really only in the movie for a short period, but for some reason he made me want to throw a shoe at the movie screen.
I'll admit this last point was rather petty.
The movie isn't without it's charms. The music, when not being sung by Stuart Townsend, is quite good. The visuals are wonderful, and by visuals I mean a half-naked Aaliyah slinking accross the screen. It's a shame that this turned out to be her last movie, because in all seriousness, she had some promise as an actress.",1049155200,2,1414,4.4423076923076925

Queen of the Damned is undoubtadly one of the worst vampire films I've ever had the displeasure of seeing, and the only reason most people went to see it was to see the late Aaliyah in a role that lasted about a whole ten minutes.  To say Stuart Townsend is terrible as Lestat is being nice, the man cannot act to save his life, he isn't believeable, and he is the exact opposite of everything Tom Cruise was in the role.  The film's screenplay and story is so different than that of the book it is based from that fans of Rice's Vampire Chronicles novels will be justifiably outraged and will laugh throughout this excuse of a film for it's entire running time.  The nu-metal soundtrack has a moment or two that's worth listening to, but it adds nothing to the film, and for me just made it more unbearable to watch.

 This is O.K but I would have done it a bit differently. First of all the screenwriters would have been the first to go! I would have gotten Neil Jordon back or Frances Ford Cappola (Bram Stokers Dracula Fame)! Second of all Aaliyah would have went through extensive vocal and acting lesson's or else. Then I would have waited on Tom Cruise to play Lestat again. Then I would have asked WB to give me a bigger budget so everything wouldn't look so fake, glossy & overdone as it did in this film. What happened to the twins Maharet and Makere? What happened to the history of how Vampirism Started? I mean after all, she was the ""Mother of all Vampires"". What happened to the Decapitation at the end of Queen Akasha? And Marius wasn't even supposed to be around because Akasha trapped him in a ice prison. Jesse's neck was broken at the concert so how was she suppose to be kicking it with Lestat? Actually they never met in the book..it was all passion between he and the Queen. These were things that were explained in the book that they totally didn't touch in the film! Acutally they didn't even touch on Egypt at all! They didn't even show the power and how regal the Queen really was. In the book there was revenge that was wanted by the Twins because Akasha tortured them centuries ago and seperated them. Floating them both in stone coffin's one to the East the other to the West! That was a huge suspense factorin the book. In the movie she had no enemies there wasn't any suspense. And Marahet didn't have a sister nor was see aggressive in any way. Queen Akasha was a human in the beginning but was consumed by a Blood sucking Spirit ""Amil"". What happened to the Blood God Azim, that Akasha despised and destroyed in one instant? Because she had come back to Reign and he was in the way.  Did they explain any of this in the movie NOOOOOOOO! They were too busy talking about the irrelivant character Lestat. In the book Lestat was relevant but in as a supporting character not the main character. I thought the movie was called ""Queen of the Damned?"" This movie was a made up ...and just took Anne rice's characters and misused them. This isn't an adaptation of the book this is a totally different situation. I also think Salma Hayek would have been a better Queen after seeing her perfomance in ""Dusk Til DAWN""! Also that girl from ""The Mummy"" wouldn't have been a bad choice! I think Aaliyah was sexy but I do think she needed more experience in acting to convey an important character like this. But with a scrip that horrible I think she was the only one up for it. I gave this movie 3 stars simply for Aaliyah's sex appeal nothing more the script was a disappointment. Queen of the Damned could have been the best Vampire flick ever made. But was destroyed by unworthy and unprofessional directors and screenwriters. This movie could have ,if it had of followed the book would have superceded ""Bram stokers Dracula"". Well, maybe someone will redo it and make it right next time. But they can't call it Queen of the Damned  because that name will be damaged forever! I think I will start writing a script and call it ""Akasha-The Vampire Chronicles!"" I could have conveyed that book in 2 and a Half hours and it would have explained everything! The first 15 mins before the credits started I could have explained the whole torture of the Twins and the transformation of the Queen. Then after the credits I would have started off showing how the Queen slayed egypt! But anyway no sense in talking about this, it is done and done very wrong! This movie should have been PG-13 I don't see where there is any graphic violence other than the club scene. This is far from scary..but the book was horrible, loaded with graphic violence. They really ruined this story it delivers nothing unusual or horrifying. This is a enjoyable film if you never read the book. The book is such a work of mastery! And the sensuality passion & suspense it reaks was not conveyed in this film at all.

Aaliyah, as Akasha, made a wonderful African Queen...oh wait, wasn't Akasha supposed to be Egyptian?  And the wonderful character of Marius, a Roman of Keltoi blood chosen for his height, beauty and blonde hair and forced into being a vampire for his looks, seems to have lost both his European background and his blondeness...oh yes, he also created Lestat.  Forget that old storyline of ""The Twins"", and ""Magnus"", and forego altogether any association with Louis and ""Interview with the Vampire"", and of Lestat making his mother into a vampire, one of the great reunions of literary plot; oh yes, and also forget the story of Nickie and his violin...Lestat didn't need Nickie here...he already carried a violin...just in case he became a vampire and was suddenly able to play one. And don't worry about he tale of how the vampires came about, because that would have been a bit too much of a waste of film to actually cover...better to go without a storyline, as they say in Hollywood.  Oh, and please ignore all events leading up to Lestat's concert, because they don't matter here, and don't make much sense.  Like I said, a cute little horror flick, if you haven't actually read the books, or followed them, or like them due to any form of elegance that Anne Rice puts into her writing.<P...P>If you're just out for a cute little flick to pass the time away while you munch microwave popcorn, this is passable, though I think you'll find the popcorn itself infinitely more interesting.

Townsend had the sex appeal that Lestat had and the correct ""feel"" for the role. The movie obviously was not correct as far as the book goes, but I personally felt that this movie was much better than Interview because of the character feel.
 The vampire chronicles by Anne Rice are incredible and suck you right in. Read the books to know the true meaning and desires of the vampires, but watch the movie for a good overview.
 I hope that in the future, if there are any more sequels, that Townsend plays Lestat again.",1045526400,,682,4.404761904761905
1734445,2,B000069I5V,"*sigh* Where to begin? When Interview with the Vampire (the movie) came out when I was in sixth grade, I was immediately hooked, and I devoured the original 4 Vampire Chronicle books one after the other. I fell in love with Lestat, I felt Louis' pain...it was wonderful. When I heard they were making a movie version of Queen of the Damned, I was glad, yet surprised, because The Vampire Lestat (book 2) is actually my favorite of the series, and I would have liked to have seen that as a movie. Now begins my rant.
There's plenty of things I could say about this movie doing no justice to the feel and/or deep and layered plot of the book. However, since it is a movie and not the book, I'll try not to get that specific (i.e., Marius didn't make Lestat, but that doesn't make that much of a difference...does it?) What really [ticked] me off about this is that instead of taking one book's plot and trying to fully develop and explain the story, they shoved a bunch of [junk] into ninety minutes and made it loud, shiny, and polished. And let's not forget the kung fu.
1) I loved Tom Cruise as Lestat, but...Stuart Townsend was hot. I'll admit it. He played the modern Lestat quite well, and I'm willing to say that his hair is *dark* blond. That doesn't quite make up for his brown eyes, however. :)
2) Aaliyah. Not bad; she certainly looked pretty, but what was up with that stupid Hungarian accent? And she had basically no character development, which brings me to
3) NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!! The only reason I recognized half of the ""ancients"" in the movie was by their costumes, because God forbid we should actually mention their names!!
4) Why did we have to have that stupid ""romance"" [stuff]? Can't we just accept Lestat as being androgynous/bisexual and not give him a little teenybopper girlfriend?
5) This wasn't even good as a plain old ""vampire"" movie. They used the same crap we've seen hundreds of times before. ""This is how you become a vampire. This is what you do as a vampire. I love you, but you're a mortal. No, I cannot bring you into my world. Well, now that you're dying, I guess I can."" And so on.
6) The soundtrack is rather well done.
So in closing, PLEASE, I implore you, do not base your like/dislike of the Vampire Chronicle BOOKS on seeing this one film. As another reviewer said, READ THEM. READ THEM NOW. They are fascinating. They are better than this movie. This movie is pretty. But it is not good.",1045094400,79,2440,4.473094170403588

To enjoy this movie, don't think of it as a sequel. Think of it as a movie all of its own, loosely based on familiar characters. Lestat is no longer himself, but instead rock star vampire with a completely different look and accent. If you can ignore that, and enjoy the loosely fitting perhaps alternate story, you can probably enjoy this movie.
Lestat's musical talents are interesting and enjoyable, though I wish they'd done more special effects to his voice. I just didn't find it superhuman enough. On the first note he sings in the movie, his voice is like a dark choir of sound, it's powerful and far beyond human. Later however, his voice seems to turn standard punk rock, nothing special but not bad. Another fault to overlook, then, is what could have been.
The movie's rather fast paced, so you won't get bored. It's got good rock sound, vampires crawling everywhere, a decent story so long as you don't expect it to have anything to do with the book. Top it all off with some cool effects. As a movie, it's average, but still good. If you like vampire movies and/or the series, don't hesitate to at watch it. It's not half bad.

Sure, the part with the Queen of the Damned herself feels very short, and she leaves just a little bit to be desired.  And sure, it's all about the Underground and maybe more likely to appeal to that crowd.  Put those things together, and you have a pretty mediocre movie, as far as I'm concerned.  But there's something about it that just pulls you in...
...oh, right, I remember.  It's because the whole thing is carried off with a mix of otherworldly drama and sexual tension (which, in a world of vampires, who don't have sex, is pretty damn cool).  It's because this movie is sexy.  As one friend put it, ""I walked out of the theatre feeling as if I had just had an orgasm.""  I didn't go quite that far, but I can't deny this movie turned me on.
It's the atmosphere that does that part, but the two leading characters (Lestat and Jesse) have a lot to do with that.  Stuart Townsend as Lestat is undeniably sexy, and a great pick (far better than the wishy-washy Tom Cruise) for the role.  It's the part that carries the film, and he does it VERY well.  Jesse (can't remember the actress' name) is also good, playing the part of an innocent soul with a hidden past even she doesn't know, and courage that both contrasts and plays oddly well with her sweet face and quiet demeanor.  Some of her lines feel a bit strained, but over all she's well done, and most importantly, she contributes to the atmosphere.

1734460,4,B000069I5V,"QUEEN OF THE DAMNED

(USA/Australia - 2002)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

Whereas INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES (1994) was undoubtedly a grade-A blockbuster - helmed by a red-hot director (Neil Jordan) and toplined by two of contemporary Hollywood's most bankable stars (Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise) - QUEEN OF THE DAMNED has the look and feel of a B-movie with delusions of grandeur. But what grandeur!

Combining elements from two of Anne Rice's celebrated Vampire Chronicles ('The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned'), the movie finds Lestat (Stuart Townsend, ABOUT ADAM) rising from his grave at the end of the 20th century, where he adopts the mantle of a rock star and 'reveals' his vampirism to a disbelieving world, thereby luring other vampires out of their hiding places to destroy Lestat for placing them at risk of discovery. But his revelations also attract the attentions of a secret society - the Talamasca - which has been chronicling the supernatural for centuries, and an inquisitive Talamascan agent (Marguerite Moreau) is both entranced and horrified by what she finds. And then there's the Queen of the Damned herself (Aaliyah), who believes Lestat may be a formidable ally in her plot to conquer the world...

Spanning several centuries and filmed with appropriate Gothic flair, the movie is anchored by Townsend's ultra-sexy turn as anti-hero Lestat. Flamboyant without ever seeming camp, he strikes a more dynamic figure than Tom Cruise's foppish blade in the previous film, and it's all too appropriate that Townsend's vampire should locate himself within the modern music industry, with its outlandish characters and overzealous visual style (several of Lestat's music videos - inspired by German expressionist cinema of the 1920's - are reproduced in their entirety in the supplemental section of this DVD, and they're convincing down to the last detail).

In fact, the entire movie forsakes the introsepctive melancholy of its highbrow predecessor and plays instead like a Gothic MTV fantasy, losing a degree of emotional resonance in the process. During an audio commentary with several key personnel, director Michael Rymer (IN TOO DEEP) points out some of the changes he was forced to make in adapting Rice's work for the screen, though predictably, he doesn't address the homoerotic undercurrent which forms a significant part of the author's literary style. Nevertheless, the script - written by Scott Abbott (INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE) and Michael Petroni (THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS) - actively celebrates the 'outsider' lifestyle (vampires, Goths, rock fans, members of secret societies, etc.) and tips a knowing wink to the initiated when Lestat exhorts his fellow vampires to: ""Come out, come out, wherever you are!""

As with the untimely death of River Phoenix during production of the first film, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED suffered a similar loss with the tragic death of co-star Aaliyah, a beautiful singer-actress who died in a plane crash shortly after completion of principal photography. Though her role is somewhat limited, she manages to steal some of Townsend's erotic thunder, and her final sequence includes one of the most visually stunning vampire disintegrations ever captured on film. Also starring Vincent Perez (THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS) and Lena Olin (ROMEO IS BLEEDING) in secondary roles.",1043366400,3,3433,5.311233885819521

The only problem I have with it is that it just doesn't have the same Anne Rice feel as did Interview With A Vampire. ""The Vampire Chronicles"" by Anne Rice have a certain feel about them. I didn't feel that Lestat was played to perfection or that the Queen could show exactly how powerful she was on screen. This is the only down side I can see to reading a book then seeing the movie afterword. Books always have more to work with and then leave it up to the imagination of the reader. If you haven't read the book this movie will be awesome to have in your collection. If you have read the book, and are a vampire movie freak like myself, then this movie would also need to be in your collection.",1043020800,,841,4.072289156626506
1734462,4,B000069I5V,"Can we even look at the movie?  WOW such extremes of adulation and vituperation.
Some people (including many professional film critics, judging from the imdb links) found Queen incoherent, hard to follow, hard to understand.
Fuddie Duddies.  Were they even paying attention?  Its been decades since I read the books and my Korean girlfriend, who saw it with me, hadn't read them at all.  We had no trouble following plot, text, or subtext.  We were/are In Love.  And this is a pretty keen love story.
Some people (many people; many Very Obsessive People) complained about the changes from the books.
So what?  These novels weren't great works of art, they're potboilers.  Maybe good, entertaining potboilers, but potboilers nonetheless.
Lestat ""was blonde.""  No he wasn't.  He was typeface on paper.  In the movie he's brunette.  OK.  In the film of Crash, the Ballard's live in Toronto.  OK.  And Crash is SO much better literature than The Vampire Chronicles.
Want incoherence?  Put in the story of the Twins, put in Magnus, put in all the other plot turns in the book and try to cut it down to a watchable film.  (First person who says ""They failed anyway"" gets sent to the princple's office.)
Anne came close to real literature with Interview With a Vampire.  The prose was dense and descriptive.  Deeply sensual.  A legacy of her writing soft core?  Maybe, but that made it the only book of the series I really liked.  (I gave up after Tale of the Body Thief.)  From The Vampire Lestat on, there was less prose and more plot.  Lots of Things Happen.  One Damn Thing Right After Another.  Not quite to the annoying level of Stephen King, but getting there.  Literature isn't about plot.  I could claim it is about character, ideas, music with words, many things;  but certainly it is not about plot.
Ironically, this particular density, this excess of plot - which bothered me from the beginning of The Vampire Lestat, but which didn't prevent me from making it through two additional volumes, so it must have been at least an effective plot - is what made the movie so much more difficult to make than Interview.
So why was Interview so much more of a failure as a film?  Probably (aside from the resolutely Ghastly Casting) because Jordan tried for too much.
Queen tried to be fun.  It was fun.  It made sense.  It was perfectly coherent if you were paying attention.  Maybe to Get the story you had to be In Love?  You almost certainly had to be alienated.  And if you aren't alienated in today's society, you aren't paying attention.  Case closed.
It wasn't the books.  It didn't have to be.  It was fun.

That book alone interested me enough to voraciously read all the others in the series!(at the time, there was only Interview With The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Tale Of The Body Thief) After seeing how beautifully haunting they made up Interview With The Vampire, I was very excited to hear they were making QOTD.  I had been forewarned that it was not going to be as faithful to the novel and I accepted that because to tell it perfectly would be to make it into a 10 hour movie.

1734478,1,B000069I5V,"Words cannot describe the absolute loathing I have for this film. No other movie has ever made me so angry and so repulsed at the same time. The fact that is was supposedly ""based"" on one of my favorite books of all time by my favorite author of all time only adds fuel to the rage. When I first saw ""Interview With the Vampire"" I was taken to a dark and gothic world. Tom Cruise's Lestat was stuck in my mind for weeks till I just had to to read every other book on the Vampire Series. The movie was a gem and everything book adaptations should be: it enhanced the experience and made me want to read the rest of the related books. This film is a travesty. There's so many things wrong with this film that I will go into list mode to get them all here:
1.) Horrible Adaptation
  I'm not kidding. The fact that they tried squeezing two books into one movie smacks of cheapness and crassness. The director obviously didn't want to take the time to actually build a story or develop characters, he just wanted to make a film filled with shiny things and other [stuff] that 14 year olds hooked on MTV will enjoy. If you haven't read the book you cannot imagine how much information is cut out of the movie. I realize that there are constraints but this is ridiculous. I watched the film with 5 people and none of them really understood what was going on. They had no idea who the Twins were, they didn't know why Akasha just wanted to kill people, they didn't know why Lestat wanted to sing in a band, they didn't know what the Talamasca was...the horror, the horror..
2.) Bad Casting
  Nothing makes me more angry than bad casting. For God's Sake Anne Rice is famous (and infamous) for her long and detailed descriptions of her characters. Is it so hard to actually get people that match those descriptions? Lestat is supposed to be beautiful, elegant and blond...Stuart Towshend just looked like a heroin addict. Marius is supposed to be majestic with long, flowing blond hair...Vincent Perez looked old and tired and once again...sickly (what's with the shoddy makeup in this film?"". All of the other vampires who made the books so colorful and seductive are given no more than seconds in the movie. And by the way, all this rage about Aaliyah's acting is unnecessary: she was not that good. She was in the movie for all of 6 minutes and had fewer lines than some of the extras. She did not transmit any information at all about her character. She was obviously cast just because she was famous.
3.) Bad Production Values
  I mean it. Bad makeup, bad art direction, murky cinematography, [bad] costumes and laughable visual effects. In the books, Vampires are supposed to be beautiful, elegant creatures who delight in wearing expensive clothes, velvet and long hair. In this movie, the vampires all look like cast-offs from ""Trainspotting"".
4.) Bad Music
  Let's just face it...there's no way a 200 year old vampire would wake up from an 80 year long sleep and want to play in a derivative, whiny nu-metal combo. He'd probably do something more in the vein of Dead Can Dance or Guns N' Roses.
  I Could go on but why let this movie take more minutes of my life? Please do buy this film. Encourage others to stay away from it. If this movie fails miserably and sinks without a trace the producers won't be tempted to try to butcher another Anne Rice Masterpiece.",1039392000,11,3362,4.514802631578948
1734479,3,B000069I5V,"Well, this movie has its flaws. It compresses two books into one ninety-minute tailspin and has the film equivalent of ADD- too much in too little time. As a serious movie, it's... well, not to be taken seriously.
HOWEVER. Stuart Townsend is absolutely edible, and his makeup and lynxlike inscrutability save the more languid moments of the film. Aaliyah is believable if a bit wooden, but she's pure eye candy. And as my friend... agrees, this movie is loads better than Tom Cruise pretending to be Lestat. It's beautifully shot, with a great soundtrack, and better than the first attempt. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I would put on a pair of comfy sweats and eat a bunch of ice cream while watching it. It's the film version of comfort food.

1734480,3,B000069I5V,"It's been years since I've read _The Vampire Lestat_ or _Queen of the Damned_, so I remember only bits and pieces of detail from them.  This probably contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the film, because the screenwriters largely mangled the plot from both of those books, combining them into one movie. If I had looked forward to the actual QotD plotline, I would've been disappointed.
Akasha actually has a relatively small role in the film, and Mekare is entirely absent. Maharet is alive and well in the Mojave Desert. Still, it all comes together, and focuses primarily upon Lestat, his transformation into a vampire, and his career as a rock star (his singing voice is Jonathan Davis, the lead singer from Korn, who is perfect for Lestat.)
For those unfamiliar with Rice's books, Lestat is a bad boy, even by vampire standards; he likes to cause trouble, and lots of it. We learn why he has a hard time being a vampire, and what he yearns for most of all. In the first few moments of the film, he awakens from a 100-year nap to find an entirely different world - a world in which he can cope much better. He outs himself as a vampire to the whole world, becomes the biggest rock legend around, and begins giving away the secrets of the vampires living among humans. The other vampires are, needless to say, a bit peeved about this, and they come after him. There are several driving forces in the film - Lestat himself, the covens coming after him, Akasha's awakening and subsequent quest for a lover, and Marius, who in this film is Lestat's sire.
While the last 20 minutes are somewhat less than gratifying, the rest of the movie is fairly sound and enjoyable. It felt shorter than it actually was, strangely enough. Large sections of the original plot are left out entirely or are incorrectly depicted, and if one were to focus on that point alone, one would probably not enjoy this movie at all. I went into it with the sole intent of just enjoying a movie that looked like it was very beautiful - and it was.
Aesthetically, this film is top-notch. The costumes, make-up and special effects are wondefully done. The acting is very good, and the screenplay itself isn't bad, either. Aaliyah did a fine job as Akasha, and Stuart Townsend was a great Lestat - much, much better than Tom Cruise. The settings are appropriately dark and moody, filled with beautiful sets, sensual people, and a wonderful soundtrack, and there is an almost dreamlike quality to much of the film.
The one problem I had with the film was that too much was cut out of it for a lot of details and characters to make a great deal of sense. When many of the ancients arrive on the scene, many questions hung in the air, chiefly ""ok, who *are* you guys, and why are you helping this person?!"" The DVD features many scenes that were cut, though, and includes notes on why the filmmakers removed them. Many of them help things come into focus more clearly, and it's unfortunate that they were deleted. Perhaps someday, an extended version will be released, reintegrating these scenes.
Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie experience, and I think even Anne Rice fans will enjoy it, if they can look beyond the liberties taken with the storyline, and just try to enjoy a vampire movie that's better than most.",1038182400,,3290,4.604770017035775

I sat enthralled for the entire film. Not only was the acting acceptable, the music/soundtrack was amazing. Overdone, just as the book, the movie seemed to capture the few things I really wanted to see realized, for example, Akasha comming to life from a statue.
Now, even though the story is horribly flawed from the book, IE Marius is Lestat's maker, no Baby Jenks, Jessie is too young, etc. I think this does a good job of at least setting the stage for Anne's dream.
Very sexy costumes and actors, with the exception of Akasha's character, this movie was pretty good. I wanted to watch this movie again and again. So, of course, I bought it and I am still pleased.",1038009600,3,917,4.431952662721893
1734482,1,B000069I5V,"Seriously, Interview with the Vampire was okay. Tom Cruise was a lot better than I expected, even if there was no way he could really capture Lestat. I didn't like Brad much. Kirsten Dunst was amazing. BUT WHAT THE HELL IS THIS TRASH! I mean, Aaliyah as the queen? Aaliyah! Some twenty-something-year-old R&B singer? I like her music, I really do. But she was so damn corny in this film that I can't bear to see her face again. That accent! Those clothes! That cheesiness, and lack of presence! (don't get me started on the makeup). And some unknown named Stuart Townsend as Lestat. If they had to use an unknown with no talent for this kind of work, they could have used a BLOND unknown! Really! He really embarrassed me at times. I feel horrible, because of all the people (like my friend, whom I watched this with) who now think Anne Rice's books are trash because of this movie. THEY AREN'T. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, FROM THE BOOK AT LEAST, IS THE MOST AMAZING CHARACTER IN CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE. READ THEM. Now, back to this horror erroneously associated with a book called the Queen of the Damned. Jesse had a tiny part in the book. She spoke maybe two lines to Lestat in the whole thing. If she had to be a love interest, they could have at least made her a female Louis or something. Instead, we get some idiot teenybopper. The real Lestat would never have spent a minute on her. If you're not an Anne Rice fan, don't watch it. If you are one, DEFINITELY DON'T WATCH IT.

I read a lot of complaining about how the film diverged from the novel, and this must be by people who missed the line that the film was ""based upon the Vampire Chronicles"".  That is, it's not supposed to be the third volume retold to the letter.  It's not even the third volume--it's QOTD and the Vampire Lestat brought together.
Lestat, as might be expected, is what makes this film so much fun.  He's an immortal bad boy with an angelic look and an unassuaging hunger, both for blood and to satisy his ego.  Prior to watching this film I had a difficult time visualizing the vampire as a rock star, but in the film flamboyant personality and music come together.  Akasha comes across well too, being softly ruthless and gently menacing.
A huge factor this film has going for it is its sensual quality, and this goes beyond Lestat in the bath with rosepetals.  It's a film you can feel with a visceral velocity.",1037750400,2,1126,4.544554455445544

While the movie doesn't absolutely suck, it can never hope to measure up to the first movie at all. Queen of the Damned should be veiwed with the mindset that it is independent from the first movie. As a stand-alone movie with an awesome soundtrack, it isn't that bad(hence my three star rating). But for true Anne Rice fans the differences from the two novels used to make this movie are glaring. There are key parts left out and alot of story points changed. If you are a fan of ""The Vampire Chronicles"" then you should either NOT watch this or keep an open mind and watch it as if it weren't part of these stories.",1037404800,,728,4.282608695652174
1734485,5,B000069I5V,"After year and a half of waiting I finally got to see this movie (it was not in theatres in my country).
I admit I had mixed feelings  about it. I read about how it differs from the books and that the whole story of the twins has been left out. I usually read Rice's books in one evening so I didn't want the movie to be anything less than that.
And it didn't disappoint. I've already watched it at least six times since I got it. I like Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat. He makes him even more erotic. And Aaliyah truly was an excellent villain. I loved her in this role (usually singers don't make such good actors). But what I mostly like about this movie are the costumes (really great) and the music which completley fits the mood of the movie.
What I didn't like though is that it's perhaps a tad too short. My friends who've also seen it but haven't read the books told me that they didn't quite understand everything. There should have been more explanation about Akasha's and Maharet's involvement in all this, their common past. But the movie isn't about them, is there. It's about Lestat and his need for a companion which he finds in Jesse. This really differs from the book but it's more fitting for the movie (like in Interview with the Vampire where Luis loses his wife and child in the movie and not his brother). I guess we need some ""usual"" romance.
All in all, the movie is a story unto itself and it should be considered as such. No need for the books. You'll fall in love with the dark realm nevertheless.",1036972800,3,1531,4.353146853146853
1734486,3,B000069I5V,"Let's start with the Good news. This movie is, if looked at as being separate from and unrelated (except for the most basic level of the plotline) to the book it shares a title with, is not half bad. It is genuine fun to watch (though some may want to turn down the volume when the music hits hard and heavy), and the actors involved all give relatively good performances. Unfortunately, it also seems quite rushed. I get the feeling that if it had taken its time and revealed the deeper past that is hinted at in places, it could have been much more (then again, that might have avoided the Bad News, seen below). Even the character that gave the movie it's title (Akasha) was skimmed over on a shallow level, which is a shame, as Aaliyah did a good job of bringing life to the Queen. As I suppose was fitting, Lestat's character was given more depth than the others, though even that was a little shallow. Stuart Townsend did a marvelous job of portraying Lestat, audacious and fearless to a fault.
Now for the Bad News: This movie, though supposedly based on the works of Anne Rice, barely qualifies as being loosely based on her work. The first mistake made was combining two books into one movie (The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned). Had each book been given it's own film, things might have gone better, and the movie might have been truer to the books.
The other mistake was almost totally ignoring the books themselves. The character's were not as they were physically described in the books (though they got Armand right and other than not being blond, Townsend did well). The form of vampire created by Anne Rice was badly mangled, with the growth of power (and the powers themselves) with age being very out of whack, thus messing up the progression of power among the main characters: the young were too powerful and the Ancients not powerful enough. The vulnerability to sunlight was totally mishandled (even Akasha should have gone into a coma during the daylight hours). Also, the relationships between the characters were completely or mostly altered in the case of the main characters. The most glaring mistake in this regard is that Marius was not Lestat's maker. Totally ignored is the fact that as the first vampire, significant harm to Akasha could endanger the whole race. Instead, there is only a threat to the one who kills her. Nearly eliminated is the story of the Ancients. I hate to say this, but the people who scripted the film and made it either had not really read the books, did not understand what they read, or just did not care.",1036800000,,2569,4.611353711790393

I have to say that if you've ever read her books, don't bother even seeing this movie, it's an abomination compared to what she actually wrote.  Now, I've talked to a few friends who saw the movie before reading the book and they said they really liked it.  Of course, they have since read the book and agree with me that the movie hardly did it justice.  The book was eloquently written, very indepth, with wonderful plot and character development.  The movie leaves many questions and most of the things that happen in the movie never even happen in the book.  Not to mention that they leave out key characters of the book.  A few of my favorite characters weren't even mentioned.  I was deeply disappointed by this movie.  I was hoping it would be like Interview With The Vampire.  There were a few alterations to it, but the essence of the book was there.  Anne Rice is a wonderful author, she captures the imagination and keeps you wanting more.  If you saw this movie without reading her books, do yourself a favor and read the book.  It'll definitely be worth your while.",1036627200,2,1268,4.504385964912281

Among the problems it has is the lack of character development for all the main characters, including, to a lesser extent, Lestat. As that vampire re-awakens to become a rock star, we never get a real good sense of who he is, and why he's ""coming out of the coffin"" and revealing himself as a vampire to the world, a big no-no. But he's got more characterization than the queen of the damned herself, as well as his sort-of love interest, who wants to become a vampire.
The pacing of the film also is off, I'm assuming because the plot is taken from a number of Anne Rice novels, not any one in particular. Though I never read them, I could feel the schizophrenia in the film and it made me wish they would have narrowed the plot down to one book.
But despite these major flaws, there is still a good deal to appreciate. The world it takes place has the right, spooky atmosphere a good vampire film is supposed to possess, much of the cinematography is visually exciting, and the queen herself, when the rage takes her, is quite an exciting sight.
Overall, this film has as many weakness as it does strengths, and it's unfortunate it's not better. But it's not as bad as many critics make it out to be. Worth at least one viewing, especially if you love vampires.",1036281600,,1480,4.346570397111913

I didn't really enjoy the profanity in it but that's just me.
Queen of the Damned raised a few more questions about vampires for me. Do they really combust in sunlight or can they walk around like the rest of us? Remember that Marius only said 'We are vulnerable in the daylight'. Another one is 'Do they really conceal their identities?' Can they remove our memories of ever even meeting a vampire? There are several variances to the answers and they sure can't be answered by simply reading the books or watching the DVD's. But they sure can entertain ya.
As for my rating, I only made it a 4 star cuz I haven't read the book yet. My rating's simply based on A/V quality, performances, and mostly on Aaliyah's costume. May she rest in peace.",1036195200,,999,4.4945054945054945

The only thing this movie has in common with the books is the title and the names of the characters. They've changed everything that made the book exceptional! I kept waiting for the joke to end and the real story to begin - but it didn't happen. I am thankful I didn't spend the money to watch this in the theater, and that I rented it first - otherwise I would probably have burned the DVD on my grill.
If you haven't read the books and you like vampire/goth stuff, then you'll probably think the movie is just great. But trust me, read the books. They're better. I wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back on this movie.
I gave it one star since that's the lowest of the low, and another star just for Stuart Townsend who made a credible Lestat. Everything else about this movie was terribly disappointing.",1035676800,2,983,4.318918918918919
1734538,2,B000069I5V,"After eight years, the sequel to ""Interview with the Vampire"" came, and with all respect to the fans of the genre and Anne Rica fans in particular, I want to speak plainly.  The film is terrible.  It is very embarrassing to see Aaliyah in this way, and I cannot find the right word to describe my feelings.
Not that Stuart Townsend as Lestat is bad.  He did a servicable job here, and he should not be blamed for not being Tom Cruise.  Production designs are modestly executed, and though Aalyah looks, I am afraid, somehow miscast (too young and too slender to be intimidating queen of vampire resurrected), she does her best to enliven her role.

But its script!  There's no way to express my sorry feelings but to report my experience in theater.  A young twenty-something  Japanese guy (I watched the film in Japan) confessed after the show before his friends that he fell asleep, confused by the incongruous story.  Yes, the film sounds like an awfully tedious speech of invited guests in your friend's wedding party, which goes on and on like a snail, without making any point.  And the film also features the mind-numbing rock music with many Goth(ic) elements thrown into here and there.
The film is about the vampires and a female researcher who is attracted by their underground world, and Aalyah's Egyptian vampire queen Akasha, but the whole work fails to concentrate our interest on one particular spot, going backward and forward in time and place, never knowing where to go.  The story as a result looks painfully repetitious.  What I am trying to say would be clear if you see the following summery of the film.
 -- Lestat rules the world (of the rock music mainly) and the heart of women -- Queen Akasha rules the heart (of Lestat) and the world (if possible) -- and Vincent Perez's Marius, Lestat's former master vampire, comes back to Lestat -- and many vampires try to kill off Lestat because the latter declared his identity before the press (however, the film doesn't make it clear whether humans take him seriously, another poor storytelling).  And there are other vampire clans lead by Lena Olin, who could or could not be Lestat's emeny.  See?  The summery doesn't make any sense after all, given too much characters.
Perhaps the film is just trying to preserve what is in the original book of Anne Rice.  But whatever its intention may be, ""Queen of the Damned"" is a messy job inspite of some of its visual flair.  I didn't like ""Interview with the Vampire"" very much, but that one at least gave us Kirsten Dunst.",1035590400,,2539,4.68018018018018

Or regretting the lack of character development. Or plot development.  Most of what I enjoy about Anne Rice's books (and the movie Interview with the Vampire, as well) is the careful attention to detail in developing her characters and their environment.

QUEEN OF THE DAMNED suffers from a multitude of disadvantages not experienced by the previous INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, but I'll only mention the two most glaring ones.  First, it doesn't have the distinguished direction of Neil Jordan.  Second, it doesn't have a star nearly as game as Tom Cruise was(contrary to some, he was actually quite good)--instead, we get Micheal Rymer and Stuart Townsend, who are simply no Jordan or Cruise.  Townsend is utterly awful as Lestat--playing him as a rock star, he has about as much charisma as a doorknob.  It's simply one of the worst performances that I've seen in some time.  The rest of the cast seems to be stuck in limbo--even usually great actors like Vincent Perez and Lena Olin are wasted (and they should thank the stars they have as little screen time as they do). As for Aaliyah, sorry to say she's no heat and all hot air as the title character, though she still fares better than Townsend.  The script does none of them any favors--it's highly pedestrian  and extremely sloppy.  To say that the film is bad would give one the impression that it has room to maneuver as at least a  guilty pleasure--uh, I don't think so.",1035504000,,1272,4.638392857142857
1734541,3,B000069I5V,"A couple days ago, I went into seeing ""In the Bedroom"" for the first time with a very positive attitude, willing to give it every break in the world. In my opinion, it was not a good movie. Conversely, last night I went into seeing ""Queen of the Damned"" with a very cynical attitude. After ""Interview With a Vampire"" was done so well, how dare this completely different crew of upstarts even try to compete with the first movie? Well, I was pleasantly surprised. For awhile.
What I thought was going to be a very cheap imitation turned out to be a serious attempt to capture the essence of the characters. I've read a lot of ""The Vampire Chronicles"" several times and the movie more or less got it right with them. I'll also say that Stuart Townsend is arguably a better Lestat than Tom Cruise. I liked the Tom Cruise performance, but when I watch that one I see Tom Cruise maybe trying a little to hard. Stuart Townsend seems to more naturally capture the vanity and arrogance of the character, while still communicating his reluctance to play the game by staying in the shadows.
Even though this one takes a lot of liberties with the book(s), I didn't have that much of a problem with them. Once again, for awhile. Once you accept the fact that this is really a combining of the books ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"", you have to expect that some compromises will be made. I did so for awhile, because these characters I knew fairly well from the literature world were acting exactly the way I expected them to act. This might bring problems to those not knowing the story, but it was fine with me.
So I'm cruising along thinking four stars, or maybe even five stars if they can end it right, when all of a sudden, the movie is over. Now the problem of putting long books, plus their own ideas into a movie. The makers of the movie seemed to forget that the title of the movie is ""Queen of the Damned"", and should have featured the Queen a lot more. You don't get to see her much at all on the screen. Aaliyah does a decent job portraying the mad Akasha, and I wanted to see more of her.
Also missing are the origin of the Queen, which the book went through great lengths to explain. This movie was doing such a good job that I could have easily absorbed another hour of not only her origins, but more about her plot of mass murder. But no, the marketers know that younger people are going to see it, and the attention span is only so long, so let's end the movie right now, even though were not ready to.
Such a shame. They had something here. For awhile.",1035417600,,2573,4.329192546583851

But now that I have seen it, let me just say that this is the best Anne Rice adaption that I've seen  since her first film adaption from her ""Vampire Chronicles"" series, ""Interview with the Vampire"" back in 1994! But, there is also another side to the film as well...and that is to remember the late, great songstress Aaliyah (""Romeo Must Die""), who died so tragically in that horrible plane crash after filming this movie. I think that she was either 22 or 23 when it happened. To me, ""Queen of the Damned"" is not really a sequel, but more of a continuation as to what happened at the end of ""Interview with the Vampire"" involving the vampire Lestat (who was played by superstar Tom Cruise at the time). ""Queen of the Damned"" focuses once again on Lestat (Now portrayed by Stuart Townsend, ""Shooting Fish""), who awakens after his 100-year slumber only to find himself among a new trend in the world...the world of rock music. And so, Lestat finds acceptance in a tattooed and pierced world by reinventing himself as a rock star. And Lestat becomes an overnight sensation around the world, etc. Meanwhile, his intoxicating Goth-riffed sound waves not only awakens the almighty Queen of the Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), but his sound also rekindles Akasha's desires as well, which is simply...to rule once again! And to also have Lestat rule by her side as well! Unless an elite few can stop Akasha's reign, everyone, even vampires, in the whole world is doomed! In conclusion, ""Queen of the Damned"" is in the same scary and gothic spirit as any other horror flick that I've seen, but better! I now own the DVD version of the film which includes tons of extras such as a many number of featurettes (including a featurette that pays tribute to the beloved Aaliyah), 13 deleted scenes, 3 full-length Lestat music videos as they were performed in the film, extended Death Valley concert sequences, theatrical trailer, and DVD-ROM features. And also, in conclusion, this film has not only two great performances from both Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, but also an excellent supporting cast including Marguerite Moreau (""Firestarter: Rekindled""), Vincent Perez (""The Crow: City of Angels""), and Lena Olin (""Romeo is Bleeding""), as well as an incredible storyline, and a great soundtrack to add!

The plot concerns Lestat awakening from a century long sleep and discovering rock music, so he takes the guitar as ""the instrument of (his) resurrection"" and becomes a rock star. Soon the authorities are alerted to ""harmful"" subliminal messages in Lestat's music (Will Tipper Gore make a comeback and claim Ozzy's a vampire after she sees this movie?)
Despite QUEEN OF THE DAMNED having a darker, more gothic tone than INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, this soon becomes just as much of a leaden bore as its predecessor. But the first five minutes of this movie is better than all two hours of INTERVIEW.
However, on a more positive note the movie features good performances from Aaliyah (though she barely features) and from Stuart Townshend as Lestat- he is far superior to Tom Cruise, who was awful and did moviegoers a huge favor by refusing to do the sequel This movie is already bad enough without Cruise reprising the role.",1035244800,,1123,4.564356435643564

In this installment of the series Lestat is played by Stuart Townsend.  He looks nothing like Tom Cruise or the Lestat described by Anne Rice in her books, but he brings to this version of Lestat a darkly brooding and sexual side we didn't see with Tom Cruise.  Akasha, although the title character in the movie, is only a minor role.  The main story line seems to be between Lestat and Jessie, a member of the Talamasca, who wishes to become a vampire.
While the movie does not follow the book, without having read the book, it is difficult to follow the movie.  The characters are not developed, and without the background information available in the book the other vampires, Akasha, Jessie, and the Talamasca would be difficult to understand.  As it is, Anne Rice's characters and story plots are mixed together to create something very different from the book.  One example is the vampire Marius being introduced as Lestat's maker.  In the book Lestat was not made by Marius, and only meets him some years after he had been a vampire.  Another example is the violin Lestat gets from the gypsy girl in the movie.  In the book Lestat gets the violin from his boyhood friend he makes into a vampire, and who later becomes insane.  While I think certain changes do need to be made to make a book into a movie, changing the whole storyline is really too much.  This movie is so different from the book that it really should not use the same title.
There are so many ways to compare the movie to the book, and show how the movie is lacking.  The book is much better than the movie.  However, the soundtrack to the movie is really good and worth buying.  Some of the scenes in the movie are really good for the visuals, just skip over the Akasha scenes.  She is the worst vampire I have ever seen.  I really did like Stuart Townsend's version of Lestat even though it is not faithful to the book in either looks or temperment.  And while Jessie was only a minor character in the book, I did like the expansion of her role in the movie.",1035244800,3,2147,4.464102564102564
1734566,3,B000069I5V,I must admit I was expecting this movie to be bad since I heard so many negative thing's about it but I decided to see it anyways since I like vampire movies and I was pleasently surprised by it. I liked it from the begining of the movie. I thought Stuart Townsed made a much better Lestat than Tom Cruise. Although it wasn't a great movie it was a good movie compared to the ... other vampire movies like Forsaken and Dracula 2000. If you wanna see a good vampire movie I recommend this one.,1035244800,,492,4.189473684210526

There is no plot, at least I couldn't find one and then to top it off they made the same mistake alot of other film makers are making... they all seem to have this morbid idea that pop singers can act!  Now I will admit Aliyah (how ever you spell her name) does make a cool LOOKING vampire they did do a good job with that, however it's ruined the minute she opens her mouth! Horrible acting!  I think the only reason this movie made any money was from Aliyah's fans especially since she died.",1034985600,,663,4.288

It's not Oscar-worthy, but no one ever claimed it was. I found myself really getting into it. Half the time, I was laughing at how the acting isn't all that great, and some of the special effects are silly, but that is what makes it so fun! I don't think it tried to be a serious movie, so as long as you don't take it as serious, you should be able to enjoy it as well.
Oh, and I think Stuart Townsend made a much better Lestat than Tom Cruise.",1034899200,2,623,3.9523809523809526
1734569,1,B000069I5V,"Disappointed in this movie is an understatement. Save your money and wait until it comes out on cable. I saw this movie when it was first released in the theaters. And the only high point of the movie was the concert scene with the music pumping (and the music wasn't that good and certainly not to every one's taste). But since that I am a rocker and generally like that kind of music, it was all right. However, it is hard to believe that a 200 year old vampire would become a rock star. Not much follows the book, but this did. Surprizingly
As for a plot? Well...good luck in finding one. Trying to combine two books into one movie that is under two hours was not a good idea. To properly do Queen of the Damned there is a need for character development of all the characters. There was no character developement for most of the ones (vampires) in the movie. The climax of the movie was not so climatic. If future movies of the Vampire Chronicles are made, I hope that they do a better job.
Aayliah was a high point, as far as acting performances were concerned. She did and excellent portrayal of the Queen. However, very disappointed that the Queen was hardly in the movie. And I think that was the general consensus of the people that were in the movie theater with me.  As for Stuart Townsend as Lestat, not as good. Even though he was nice to look at, his performance of Lestat was not true to character. However, I do not think that this is reflective of his talent, but that of the screenwriter.  I think that the Tom Cruise version in Interview with the Vampire was a better performance in comparison.  Maybe because it was a better written part.
While watching this movie I couldn't believe my eyes how much of it they got wrong. Did the screen writer and director even read Anne Rice's book?! I can understand creative freedom, but this is not creative whatsoever. I can't believe that Rice okayed this.
Now if you haven't yet seen this movie and have not read the Vampire Chronicles by Rice... I highly suggest that you go out and rent this one before spending the movie to buy it. My view on this movie is purely from that of one that has read all of the Rice Vampire Chronicles, and knows the stories of the Vampires very well. So if you have read the Vampire Chronicles and seen Interview with the Vampire, then this movie was a big disappointment to me, it might be for you too.",1034640000,,2396,4.379775280898876
1734570,3,B000069I5V,"First, I want to start out by saying that if you are expecting the movie version of Anne Rice's books, push those thoughts and/or expectations out of your head right now. 99.999% of the things in this movie DID NOT happen in the books. Characters are left out, huge parts are twisted around, and well, this is just not the same story. Aside from the characters, this is pretty much just an original movie. So you need to go at it that way. Forget Anne Rice even exists.
Okay, so now that I've cleared that out of the way, let's get down to the movie. Listen folks, this isn't cinema. This isn't even close. Remember when we pretended that Anne Rice and her books didn't even exist? Well, I'm also gonna' have to ask you to forget about the first movie, Interview With the Vampire, as well. Interview was an well-thought out, careful adaption of Rice's story, that perfectly portrayed the melancholy and pain associated with not only having to be alive forever, but of the bloodlust and killings and guilt associated along with it.
Queen is not that movie. Queen is a full on assault, a barrage of sex, rock, and pop culture. Do not look for any hidden meanings, people. This is a movie, meant purely for enjoyment and seemingly for the prostitution of special effects. It is pure fun, and while it does have its moments, there is absolutely nothing of substance here. But Kudos to the Makeup people. The Vampires are spectacular, their teeth sexy and sharp rather that gaudy.
So. If you were waiting for that next, haunting, movie adaption of one of Rice's Vampire novels, please, I beg you, hold out and wait to see if they ever get around to The Tale of the Body Theif, and pray they don't screw that up. But if your looking for a fun, trendy, hip movie full of sex and music and Stuart Townsend clad in leather, buy this. Then invite your significant other over, put on the Nine Inch Nails, and retrieve the liquid latex from the closet.
Oh, and have a little fun witht his. This movie is perfect for ridicule. Point out Townsend's sexy smirk, which looks as though he should be wringing his hands together and asking if we can make a deal. And when Aaliyah's character pulls the beating heart out of the DEAD vampire's chest. Pure Entertainment, people.",1034640000,7,2257,4.534313725490196
1734571,3,B000069I5V,"Is Queen of the Damned a bad movie? First you have to define what variation of the word bad you are using. Is it bad, as in unwatchable Battlefield Earth bad? Is it bad because it was disappointing, like The Phantom Menace or Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes was bad? Or bad, as in adaptation bad, like Dune?

I certainly can't say it was bad in a disappointing way, since I had no expectations. I fully expected Queen to be abysmal. Maybe with some small hope that it at least would be a tad more bearable than The Forsaken. I knew it was going to be at a minimum a Dune level bad as The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned are favorite books of mine. From the film's inception I knew they'd quite possibly deconstructed the story beyond recognition. Anne Rice should be rolling over in her grave. Wait, she's not dead. Never mind. In fact I think she said she liked it. Oh well. She did however offer to write the screenplay for free and was declined. Clearly remaining faithful to the books was not on the filmmaker's agenda.

Queen of the Damned is all and neither of these many flavors of bad. It is simply a non-event. The problem being that it walks a middle ground achieving nothing more than mediocrity. It neither embraces the camp factor inherent in the subject matter - vampire rock star indeed, the possibilities are endless -  nor does it take itself and its source material seriously, aiming for a film that transcends its subject. Interview With The Vampire took this risk and achieved something different, oft times special. So Queen ends up being nothing more than a rather sad footnote in the decline of The Vampire Chronicles.

The movie itself is not the reason to get the DVD.  Get the DVD for the music videos.  They are so wonderful and creative you wonder what happened to the talent that went into them when it comes to the move",1034640000,2,1856,4.460176991150442

If this movie had been done right; that is, as two movies -- the Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned -- then they would have been a hell of a lot better than this bastardized version of two great novels.  The writers, producer and director have pulled a mish-mast of plots from both novels, changed complete story lines, and created a mess.  Stuart Townsend,Aaliyha, and Marguerite Moreau were great choices for the characters of Lestat, Akasha, and Jesse, but the rest were pathetic.  Vincent Perez was completely wrong as Marius, Lena Olin was over the top as Maharet -- and this time no twin sister, in addition the characters of Pandora, Armand, and Mael were completely underused and poorly acted.

It shares the characters, places, general plot, but any fan, like me would find it hard to see many simularities.  Having said that.  the film is amazing for what it is.  A fun slice of fantsay, sexulay charged horror.  Stuart Townsend is a amzing Lestat, cold, warm, funny, dry.  Comanding the screen with a slight movement of a hand.  Alliyah is at best ok as akasha, Vincent Perez is delightfuly wicked as Marious, the rest of the cast do a fine job. Holding up each charcter well.  as already said the plot and character traits are somewhat diffenet but anyone who want s a good escape into a vampire world. This is it.  If you want a faithful conversion of the books, keep on looking cause it ain't gonna happen, ever i suspect.  its just too big a undertaking.
My advice is to leave all preconcieved notions at the door and just enjoy the movie for what it is.
Also the extras are amazing.  real love and care have gone into it.  comentries, deleted scenes, lestat music vids, trailers. etc etc.

1734574,1,B000069I5V,"Being a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles series, I was dying to see ""Queen of the Damned"" despite initial reluctance of the idea of skipping the second book ""The Vampire Lestat"" in favor of ""The Queen of the Damned"". Still ""The Queen of the Damned"" (as in the novel) pretty much picks up where ""The Vampire Lestat"" leaves off and also covers a good deal of the second book too. Now that I have seen the movie, all I can say is what a load of *** was wasted to make this dud of a movie. Unfortunately the late Aaliyah's final role is in this dreadful film. Her character Akasha was reduced to stupid lines written by writers who can't write a single decent line in this entire film. Granted in ""Interview With the Vampire"", I thought Antonio Banderas was miscast as Armand (who in the series is only 17 years old). In ""Queen of the Damned"", everyone except for the character Jesse was miscast, especially the character David Talbot. In the book version, David is approximately in his 60s, not in his 40s. Another stupid flaw in this movie is that Marius DID NOT make Lestat. The vampire Magnus made Lestat. Marius did not have short brown hair, he had long, blonde hair. Where the hell was Louis, Lestat's long-suffering partner, Gabrielle, Lestat's mother, Armand, a Lestat associate, Santino, and Maharet's sister Mekare? There was no explaination to who the other vampires were at the end of the movie but I am guessing they were Eric, Khayman, Mael, and Pandora. Khayman and Pandora did not die in the book. The writing was awful. Who ever wrote the screenplay needs to be dragged out into the street and shot. None of that garbage in the movie happened in the book. Jesse never went into that vampire bar. Those two girls that Lestat preyed on in the beginning never occured, and certainly not that wretched scene with the gypsies after Marius made Lestat into a vampire. Oh heck! 99% of the movie never happened in the book. This movie should not have been titled ""Queen of the Damned"" because it does not follow the book faithfully. The acting is awful.

I have to say, it was awesome!  Stuart Townsend did a great job taking over the role of Lestat after Tom Cruise's stellar performance in Interview With The Vampire, and Vincent Perez was extremely good as Marius, Lestat's maker.  Marguerite Moreau turned in a wonderful performance as Jesse, the young Talamasca intern who discovers that her Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) is actually a vampire who had borne a child before being made, and continued to watch over the descendants of her daughter down through the centuries, and Paul McGann was very good as David Talbot, Jesse's Talamasca mentor.
My highest praise for this film goes to the late Aaliyah, who turned in a bravura performance as Akasha, the ""mother"" of all the vampires.  Aaliyah's Akasha was so wonderfully evil and decadent that for nights after watching QotD I found myself half-expecting her to leap out of the floor.  Had Aaliyah lived, I think she would have gone on to a wonderful career in movies, and I find it sad that she was taken from us so soon.

Loves...Costumes, Sets, Special Effects, Music, the ""Look"", The subject matter, and (of course) the Author. I loved all of the music videos and the concert especially. Aalyiah was the perfect Akasha. She played it well.
Hates...Stuart Townsend as Lestat -- He plays a beautiful Vampire but He is not Lestat. He lacks the Charisma and the Look. Tom Cruise did a better Job in IWTV but he was playing a character as viewed through the eyes of another. Nevertheless Stuart is not Lestat. (He did make a sexy vampire rockstar though)
More hates... The story-- I know the book in itself is too long but the movie tryed to tell the story of 2 books in one setting. (the Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned)The plot had holes in it. Characters wound up underdeveloped. The pace of the movie was compleatly off.
One more hate... What is up with introducing the vampires of old at the very end, and leaving out 3 main characters that I love? I know they had to shorten it for time but It took more vamps than what they had to go up against Akasha. And most of the vamps they ""awakened"" did not look like themselves (namely Armand as a curly blond fop)
So much to love...So much to hate. Well you must decide for yourself. If you adore all of Anne Rice's Books and are very detail oriented, you might want to just rent it.

1734590,3,B000069I5V,"Queen of the Damned is a good looking, but ultimately shallow guilty pleasure.  Featuring a gorgeous cast, including Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, beautiful costumes, and a good soundtrack, this film unfortunately ultimately fails to live up to expectations.
As so many here have said, in the attempt by the filmakers to combine elements of several of the Vampire Chronicles novels into one film, they have butchered the story beyond all recognition.  Most tellingly, Anne Rice completely distanced herself from the project.  This said, I feel that we must take this film on its own as it is.  The story revolves around the awakening of the vampire Lestat from a century-long slumber when he is seduced by the alure of the music of a new age.  He sets himself up as a rock superstar and in his desire for fame and recognition, starts giving away vampire secrets in his song lyrics.  Thus his music has the double effect of not only enraging his fellow undead, but also awakening Akasha, the Queen of the Damned, the mother of all vampires herself, who comes looking for Lestat to crown as her new king.  Lestat and his music has also seduces Jesse Reeves, a beautiful young paranormal investigator who, as she delves deeper into the dark underworld, finds that being the living dead may not be all it's cracked up to be.  In the end, there is a final showdown between Akasha and the Ancients and ultimately Lestat finds redemption through his newfound love with Jesse and he is freed from his lingering guilt and the prison of immortality that he has long felt weighing on his soul.
Queen of the Damned fails to really deliver the goods.  It comes across as a flashy, fashion soaked music video with tons of style but little real substance.  The script is disjointed and comes complete with clips of MTV News spouting cheesy lines like ""Goths have started arriving in Death Valley"" and a Talamascan rede that urges ""Observe the dark realm but be not of it"".  Annoying plot holes abound also.  For instance, who are the Ancients exactly and where did they come from?  Why is it after all this time that Marius comes back to defend Letstat?  Who are the Talamasca and what is their purpose?  These things are never explained.  None of the characters are really explored with any depth and thus we have no real involment with any of them.

After many centuries of absorbing dust, Lestat the vampire finally decided to get out to become a rock singer? He ruined the vampire secret and exposed the world about their nature. Who cares? All of the vampires wanted him dead, except for one. Akasha (Aaliyah) wanted him to be her prince. Bad taste. She ruined the Death Valley concert to get to him (good job! terrible concert!). There was one moment though that was memorable. The scene where Aaliyah was in a tub full of roses, it was hot! I'm sure this movie was nothing like the book, I don't know because I haven't read it.

If you are looking for a continuation of 'Interview' then stop, go back to your shopping cart and delete this DVD from your selections because you will find almost nothing of that in 'Queen'. The plot and the characters in 'Queen' were soooo empty and watered down that at times the plot was just yawn worthy, at other times the plots were not followed through. The ancients were almost nonexsistant (if they had only put those deleted scenes back in!!).The one thing, the only thing that this movie got right was Armand, that is, if you could even figure out which one he was because they never mentioned him by name! Also, the special effects were rather cheesy, Matrix-like and unappropriate for a movie that was trying to walk in the footsteps of 'Interview'. I did really enjoy Stuart Townsend as the 'rocker' Lestat and I don't think Tom Cruise would have had that same effect. Much respect to the actress, but I did not think that the Queen of the Damned was accurately portrayed. I really think the main cast was way too young and gave the movie a teeny bopper feel to it. On the other hand the movie had one GREAT feature which was the music. The words of the songs are great at portraying Lestats feelings and the soundtrack is unbelievable. I can't get enough of it. The DVD is also LOADED with many unbelievable features such as concert sequences and Lestat music videos, which make the DVD worth buying just for that. There are also loads of deleted scenes and other great features. In addition there is a gag reel which ruins the atmosphere of the movie but is amusing to look at regardless. If you are a die hard by-the-book Anne Rice fan then forget the movie and get the CD instead. If you like vampire movies then get both the CD and the DVD, I still think that this movie was better then Dracula 2000,Blade, Vampires and the rest of Hollywood-gone-wrong vampire movies .

1734606,3,B000069I5V,"Combining The Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned novels into one screenplay was, ahem, damned to suffer massive story cuts because of the intricate and detailed background of a dozen or so characters involved. The amount of detail always was the strength of the Vampire Chronicles, in my opinion, and they were certainly worth the read.
That said, the question remains, without the detail and extra characters, can the basic story of Lestat's re-awakening of the Queen of all vampires be entertaining and sufficient enough to sustain itself? While I can not answer the question with a glowing appraisal, I will certainly admit that it did a decent job of combining all of the basic elements into a stand alone movie. The fact that this movie can stand on it's own without any ties to the prequel, Interview with the Vampire, is one of it's assets. You do not need any fore-knowledge of the characters, books, or prequel movie in order to watch this.
Even though it fits into it's own little package does not mean it was packed very well. There were some plot holes, some of which could have been filled by simply restoring the ""Ancients"" scenes that were on the dvd. I understand, as the dvd points out, that they were left out because it introduced another subplot and characters that would add unnecessary confusion. While I agree with their reasoning, I do think they should have somehow salvaged the scene so that while the introductions of the ancients would have been left out, Maharet's few lines about Akasha's reign of destruction and the vampire's responsibility should have remained. They would have added a needed sense of urgency and motivation that would have made the final confrontation with Akasha and the ancients a bit more reasonable and satisfying.
The character of Jessie is supposed to be the human link for the viewer to empathize through as they are taken into the world of vampires. In some scenes, this works adequately, but on the whole, Jessie's motivations, while they are explained, seem kind of empty. I am not sure if I can fault the actress or script, but when the movie was over, I still felt ambivalent about the character's experiences.
There were other elements that were not as fleshed out as they could be. The paranormal Talamasca needed a bit more background about their vampire tracking as did the character of Maharet and her family tree. Like Jessie, they were given some explanation, but I think a couple more lines of dialogue would have helped.
As I mentioned, the movie did a decent job of the basic story, but massive changes were made from the source material. Characters were dropped completely, or merged together, and huge sections of character history were removed. Most notably, Lestat's history is extremely compacted and revised. Nonetheless, there are some things that remained that I thought were done pretty well. The character of Lestat in this picture is rebellious and reckless which is more true to the character than he was portrayed in Interview. Lestat's re-awakening and concert scenes were exactly like I had envisioned when I originally read the book. The character of Akasha was also as I pictured and a very good casting choice.
If you are a fan of the books, and you need the twins, Gabriel, Magnus, and crew, you are going to have difficulty sitting through this. If, on the other hand, you can set that aside and view this as a vampire movie of it's own, unrelated to the chronicles, you will probably enjoy this for the stand-alone vampire flick that it is.
In summary, worth the rental",1032825600,,3571,4.817589576547231

This had the potential of being a really good movie, but goes down underground faster than a vampire at daybreak. My biggest complainant was the non-existence of the ""Redhaired Twins"" storyline and the tie in with ""The Great Family."" It was such an important part of the book, that here gets no screen mention at all.  Akasha's death scene in the end is therefore anti-climatic for me and boring. Also you never get a strong sense in the movie of what Akasha's mission is for earth, which she makes a very strong arguement for in the book.  While The  DVD does pack a few nice extras- A tribute to Aaliyah, behind the scenes, the making of the music for the film (Lestat's band).  The ""Unseeen"" (deleted senes) offer a little more plot line, it is still not enough for any real fan to sink their teeth into.  Aaliyah rocks in her screen debut as Akasha,  It is sad because she did have great potentail as an actress that we will never see again.  Stuart Towsend does a worthy job as Lestat.

The first thing you really notice is that the whole movie should have been on MTV.
The movie didn't have a plot what so ever.  They could have atleast made on up for gods sake.  Why cut out character who were important to only have them in for one minute of the film???

1734611,1,B000069I5V,"This movie is....an abomination.
Queen of the Damned is my favorite book of the series.  I was greatly anticipating this film until I read about creative conflicts between the movie makers and Anne Rice.  That prevented me from shelling out [some money] to see it in the theater.  I still reserved some hope that it would be worth a rental.  Boy, was I wrong.
An insult to anyone who has read and even remotely cared for Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  I can see why she distanced herself from the project almost from the very beginning.  I wish I had distanced myself from renting this steaming pile!  At least I wasn't fool enough to buy it!  Oh where to begin....
My biggest gripe is that Marius, my favorite character, is portrayed by some gimpy balding guy with brown/black hair.  My impression of Marius in the novels was a rather large man with long blond hair.  That is just one of many casting flubs.
I understand the need to make certain changes to a book in order to get it to the big screen, but some of what was done to this great story is simply unforgiveable.  They omit vital characters, such as Louis.  Other characters are there, but aren't introduced or given any part in the tale other than to stand around looking wise and then to die at the hands of Akasha in the incredibly cheesy final battle.
Marius as Lestat's creator??  Did they read the books?  There is much more to complain about but I see there are already 300+ reviews saying pretty much the same thing as me so you get the idea.  The movie is terrible.

While I would have liked Louis to have actually been in the movie, it was still good.

1734613,4,B000069I5V,"Okay, first of all, I rather enjoyed this movie without reading the book first. To me, it was a good story if you had nothing to compare it to. After I read the book, I did think that there were a few things that could've been in the movie. Of course, when I see a movie I really enjoy, I have to make a big deal out of it and do my research. If you want your explanations as to why some things were done the way they were done, take a peek at the ""QotD"" Warner Bros. website ... When I reviewed what the producer had to say, it made more sense to me. If they had used everything out of the book exactly the way it was, the movie would've been as long (and maybe even boring) as ""The Lord of the Rings"". Some of you may say to yourselves 'So? I'm a die-hard Anne Rice fan. I wouldn't be bored!', but that's not how Hollywood thinks. They want to please EVERYONE. I also want to mention that the movie is BASED on the book. Which means, Hollywood took the story and characters from the book and basically made a story of their own. I've also seen a lot of people say that Tom Cruise was a better Lestat that Stuart Townsend could ever be. You guys have to remember that in ""IwtV"", the story was being told by Louis, not Lestat. The story was in his point-of-view and Louis thought that was the way Lestat acted, so that's how Tom Cruise acted. Stuart Townsend had to play a whole different character. He really played Lestat in first-person-point-of-view. Even if you still think Stuart Townsend did an awful job, remember that he did what the director told him to. It wasn't his choice to act that way. Also, the accent thing isn't entirely that bad. If you just get into the movie and stop paying attention to the smallest details, you won't mind the Irish sound of it. Although, I thought Stuart Townsend did a superb job protraying Lestat as a sexy rockstar. On the subject of Aaliyah, even if she wasn't the right skin-tone (which doesn't entirely matter), I thought her performance was amazing.
The basic story tells of The Vamire Lestat (Townsend) awaking from over 200 years of sleep to find the world he left changed. Rockstars, or gods as he calls them, had taken over the world and he believes if he becomes one, he can ""live in the light"". And low and behold, he becomes a ""god"" managing to enrage the entire vampiric world along with awaking Akasha (Aaliyah), The Queen of the Damned. Akasha wants Lestat as her king so she can bring hell to all of the earth and Lestat has a VERY big descision to make. Will he submit the earth to Akasha, or help the ancients kill Akasha and protect the mortal ancestry?
It can be a movie most people would either hate or love, so before you go and buy it, I would suggest renting it first. If you do decide to buy the movie, I recommend getting the DVD as it has tons of extra features (such as Lestat's music videos). All in all, I really did think this movie was an excellent addition to my collection. I also will tell you to check out the soundtrack. Great music.",1032393600,2,3015,4.281961471103328

Now as for being true to the book(s)? Hardly!
For one the title of the movie is Queen Of The Damned but, in truth it smashes (and badly) two books into one short movie.  The whole history part about Lestate is horrible wrong.. marius did not create Lestat.  In fact Lestats creator burned himself do death in front of Lestat.  Marius though was the keeper of the mom and dad..
Going even further.. what is this jesse part?  In the book if memory recalls there is a short chapter in which Jesse ,a red haired girl, goes up in flames as one of the first victims of the Queen.. She was not in love with Lestat.
And as for the DVD.. it was chock full of excellent extra footage but, it was also a source of distress on my part when I noticed that some of the deleted scenes where about the elders.. Which play a large part in the books.. along with the Twins.. (Read the book if you have no idea who they are).
In the end I give the movie a C..  I would have given it higher if they would have chose to stick to one of the books and stayed more true to the story line.",1032393600,2,1240,4.040816326530612
1734625,1,B000069I5V,"ok, the queen of the damned... the book was really good, and it would have made a very decent movie(if it would have followed closer to the book)and had different actors. I have never understood making a sequel to a movie - or continuing a book series- and not using the same characters that were in the 1st part of the series. and this time its no different. the people and the actors that were in interveiw with the vampire should have also done queen of the damned. The movie would have probably turned out much better... and tom cruise makes a much better lestat than townsend does. Louis, and armand are also in the book, and they were also included in the movie, but they weren't even there enough to be acknowledged. People wouldnt even have know that armand and louis were in the movie if they weren't a diehard fan of the books also. They played a major role in the plot of the book that in my opinion should have been kept and adapted to the movie. However there are 2 scenes in the movie that i thought were very good, and that was the scene of akasha and lestat in the tub with all the rose petals, and the ending. Neither one are a part of the book, something similar happens in the book, but i think it was adapted rather well... the one thing they left out of the movie was the situation with the ""twins"" it was a good part of the book, that should have been pursued in the movie.. I overall am not a big fan of the movie... I think that it could have been done alot better.

To reiterate what everyone has been moaning about, this is not a sequel to Interview with the Vampire and though it is based on the Anne Rice novel of the same name, if you come to the movie expecting an accurate visual recreation of the events depicted within the book, you're going to be sorely disapointed. However, watch with an open mind and maybe slightly under the influence of a few drinks and you may find yourself easily entertained for the duration of the movie. The film stakes it's claim (pun intended) from the get go. It's a film about a rock star vampire so if the idea sounds ridiculous to you, then you probably won't get it. However, those out there who realise it's an idea with a veritable gold mine of rich and intoxicating avenues open to it will relish the images served up in the movie. The critics, while openly singing Aaliyah's praises, panned the film mercilessly, singling out Stuart Townsend inparticular. I personally think Aaliyah's performance to be a little overated and found Townsend's performance to be right on the dot. Nowhere near as good as Near Dark and The Lost Boys, Queen of the Damned warrants at least one late night viewing for those with a taste for the macabre (and a fondness for heavy and brutal music would also be a benefit). Watch and you may be surprised and I'll see you in the Admiral's arms (if I ever find the [darn] place).",1032048000,2,1411,4.5810276679841895
1734628,2,B000069I5V,"There are certain truth's in a revolving pop-culture world. For example, to destroy the integrity of the work to gather dollars from the masses. And the term ""sold out"" or ""sell out"" can apply to this particular type of blatant irresponsibility. It was once understood that Anne Rice challenged the move to let Tom Cruise play her beloved Lestat; a move that proved to be an exceptional one. What happened this go-around?
Stuart Townsend doesn't have the range, versatility, or skill of an accomplished actor like Cruise who redefines ""performance"" and ""believability"" to his characters. Cruise also has the perfectionism to study both the script and the book to set a foundation for the character. Townsend makes a mockery of Lestat from the very beginning and gives the feel of a ""Crow: City of Angels"" feel. Maybe he researched Vincent Perez's character, or he took some pointers from the supporting actor who plays Marius. Either way, the integrity of Lestat is destroyed. Aaliyah is another example of miscasting.
While you sit through this movie, one tends to wonder whether Anne Rice has any creative control over her works. As an author, it should be your sworn duty to protect that which you have labored, regardless of the dollar signs flashing from studio executives.
I'm sure that cult enthusiasts will label this movie as a high point, due mainly to setting and Gothic tone of the movie in the same way they flocked to ""The Crow"" and ""Blade"" sequels.

This Lestat was more alive, vibrant,less brooding,believable and sexy. I followed the script without much trouble.
Have heard that some viewers didn't understand the film. Well, I don't know how much education those individuals have.....
And the criticism of Aaliyah's character/acting. There was nothing that I could see that merited any such criticism. Her character was that of a African Goddess, a queen who was the most powerful of her kind. She had a relationship with Lestat__
Which might be the reason why many felt ""uncomfortable"" with this movie. The relationship was in context with the storyline therefore I felt nothing was out of line there. But if it makes anyone feel better, she was evil, betrayed by those she trusted and was destroyed at the end. But she will return again!! And will avenge her betrayal.

First of all, Stuart Townsend did play a good Lestat, but first they have to get his story straight. MARIUS DID NOOOOT MAKE HIM!!! Lestat was about a century old before he even met Marius. a renegade vampire name Magnus made Lestat.
Next, Akasha is not so powerful that she can be awake during the day. Lestat definitely can't. No matter how powerful you are, even if the sun doesn't affect you, all vampires sleep in the daytime.
And how could they leave out so many characters?? Like Lestat's two fledglings, Gabrielle and Louis(from Interview with the Vampire). How could they leave out Marius' two fledglings, Armand and Pandora. What about Armand's fledling, Daniel? Maharet's two feldglins Mael and Eric, and by the way, Maharet made Jesse, and before Akasha even came!!! All of these characters were in the book, AND then finally they killed Akasha wrong. Maharet's twin, Mekare, came and killed her, and ate her heart and brain, making her the new Queen of the Damned.

If you are looking for a true adaptation from the book to the movie, you are going to be dissapointed. Please, as you watch this film, keep in my mind that the people who created this film had a lot they wanted to fit into this movie (being that it is based on two books) and didn't want the movie to drag on.  After seeing the deleted scenes on DVD I feel they should have left the scenes with the ancients in, the scene where Jesse dreams of Akasha (maybe its just me but I love that scene) and the extended dancing of Akasha with her words to Lestat. I fail to see how deleting those scenes made the movie any better.
I was very impressed with Aaliyah's performance. Stuart Townsend's was pretty good as well, along with Margarite Moreau, Lena Olin, and Vincent Perez. Aaliyah haunts the screen in this movie, and the anticipation for her appearence on screen is one of the things that makes this movie so great. You just keep waiting for her to come, the tension building by the minute. And when she finally does come, her performance is mind-blowing. She was made for the role of the mother of all vampires. Who cares if she is black and in the books she is white...she portrays Akasha the most accurately of any of the actors.
At times the dialogue is a bit cheesy (""You're bold, like you're music"") but at others it's genius. If you are a fan of the books, please just try to think of this movie as a seperate story and you'll enjoy it just fine.
The special effects are nice as well. This movie is true eye-candy, with Aaliyah and Stuart leading the whole thing, with Margarite (who has a major role in this movie and acts its well, but was skipped out on by many reviewers and got some greif for previously starring in the 'Mighty Ducks' trilogy) following close behind, hating Akasha for 'stealing her man' all the way there.  The music in this movie is excelent, it is on par with the film.
As for the DVD, it has bouns features galore, including three excellent documentaries and a hilarious gag reel.
I would give this movie an A- and the only thing I could wish for in the movie is if they would have explained the story of Akasha's history and the anient vampires, but then again that would make the movie extremely long. ""All Hail the Queen.""

I don't really need to see the film as it was in book--I can visualize just fine while I'm reading without being spoon fed.
Personally, I find this sort of parallel universe intriguing and refreshing.  Stuart Townsend was so good as Lestat, I found myself thinking...Tom who?  As far as his sexuality, I think his heterosexual relationship was quite believable.  Yes, Lestat has demonstrated homosexual tendencies.  So what?  That kind of sexual ambiguity is all part of the anti-hero persona that's not only evident in rock stars like Jagger and Bowie but goes as far back as Byron and Shelley (the rock stars of their day).
My advice is if you're in the mood for a good read, curl up with The Vampire Lestat.  If you're in the mood for a good film, sit back and drink in Townsend as Lestat in Queen of the Damned.  Experience either on their own merit and you'll come away satisfied.",1031356800,4,1163,4.624390243902439

If you are a fan of Rice's work, then the movie is a travesty. If you aren't a fan, you might think it's no sillier then the books. If you've never read her or never heard of her, then it should be a treat - an inventive, if a bit cheesy, horror movie.
Whatever your opinion, it's hard to argue that the film has much of anything to do with the books, outside of the fact that the main characters are vampires. It also has little in common with ""Interview With the Vampire"" [1994], the first movie based on a ""Vampire Chronicle"" book. That film, to me, was a grand, glorious, big budget, star-filled [Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst] Hollywood epic.
""Queen of the Damned"" is a modest affair. The cast is not all that famous. The story omits most of the important elements and themes of the books. The special effects are obviously computer generated. The songs performed by Lestat and his rock group are surprisingly good and are one of the movie's highlights.
The plot has to do with Lestat's waking up after a hundred year nap. He finds the modern world much to his liking. Tired of being anonymous, he starts his band, openly proclaims himself a vampire, and dares the other blood drinkers to come and get him. They do, of course. Among them is that damned queen, Akasha, an ancient Egyptian who is the mother of all vampires. She makes Mommie Dearest look like a saint. To make matters worse, Lestat is also pursued by a fanatical female mortal who's in love with him.
Stuart Townsend is decent enough as Lestat. While his performance palls in comparison to Cruise's version, it should be noted that Townsend didn't have much material to work with. The late Aaliyah obviously had a blast playing Akasha; in fact, every time she and Townsend look at each other, they appear to be in danger of bursting out laughing.
I AM an Anne Rice fan, so you can guess where I stand on this movie. I tell myself that she's just one in a long list of novelists whose books [or some of them] have been trashed on film. Still, if you can forget the movie's source, it will probably seem as good as most recent horror flicks.",1031184000,,2348,4.501170960187354
1734652,1,B000069I5V,"I would agree with most that it is difficult to make any novel into a film.  But the elements which are essential to develop a story are missing altogether here.  First, the characters in the film are shallow and empty, totally straying from what makes Anne Rice's books so interesting.  The surface of internal conflict is scratched, but vainly.  The characters don't even follow physical descriptions given in the series.  Acting in the film was HORRIBLE!  Special effects were cheap and embarrassing.  Overall, a poor adaptation that leaves you wondering what book the producers read.  Too bad , so many good things could have been done with this film.",1031184000,,655,4.944954128440367
1734663,1,B000069I5V,"While Anne Rice's style does (traditionally) lend itself to very rich prose, the adaptation named after her third Vampire Chronicle seemed to ignore the book completely, especially in matters concerning characters, settings, and plot.  A paltry few of the discrepancies:  Marius did not make Lestat, Magnus did.  Lestat did not kill Akasha, Mekare did.  Who's Mekare?  Good question.  Read the book.
I have adored Anne Rice's books for over a decade, and eagerly anticipate each one's release.  QOTD is by far one of my favorite from the vampire series, with a rich historical plot as well as sumptous characters.  From the opening sequence where Lestat rises from the grave (which he didn't) to the final moment of Jesse and Lestat moving off into the crowd of London (which they don't), the movie was a disgrace and a travesty.
I sometimes wonder if the screenwriter's actually read the book.  Anne Rice should really consider legal action.
We know that books can be made into movies.  Peter Jackson has done/is doing a wonderful job with the Lord of the Rings, another series steeped in rich dialogue and verbose descriptions.  We know the movie had a decent budget, because we saw the effects and the costumes.  Apparently, the producers were more concerned with regaining those revenues rather than staying true to the story.

Please do not misunderstand me. I think the acting and casting were beautifully done. If you have read the book, and want to look for similarities, I don't suggest trying. However, as a movie ( looking at it without prior knowledge) I would say it was a bit slow moving at first and too fast at the end. Two sequences were not introduced properly and may cause confusion. Also, this is not a movie you would want to view on family night if you want to desensitize your children.",1031097600,,651,4.4789915966386555

The bottom line is the movies are NEVER as good as the book so get that straight!  And you knew this script was going to marry two books together to make one movie so that was going to be double trouble.  You will have to accept the movie for what it is and it while it is not the greatest piece of cinema I've ever witnessed, it is pretty good for the vampire genre.  This DVD is much more worth buying than the moving was seeing initially.  If you are a fan of ""extras"" you certainly get them along with a far too brief tribute to the late star, Aaliyah. I am a huge fan of hers so anything containing her is of interest to me.  The soundtrack and score were largely underrated by the public and fortunately you get the opportunity to here from Jonathan Davis and Richard Gibbs as to how they came up with the music for the film.  I don't think QOTD received as much credit as it should have and I think part of it was because people were afraid of the fact that there was a dead actress attached to the project.  She loved her work and wanted it released.  This is what her family wanted, this is what the studio wanted, and Aaliyah wouldn't have had it any other way!

1734669,5,B000069I5V,"To begin with, Interview With the Vampire is my favorite movie of all time, and I thought Tom Cruise was wonderful as Lestat de Lioncourt.  When I first saw the trailer with Stuart Townsend in the role, I thought, ""Who is this guy?  What were they thinking to choose him?""  Nonetheless, since I love the Vampire Chronicles, I just had to see the movie anyway no matter how terrible I thought Townsend would be in it.
When I saw the movie, I finally realized why Townsend had been cast.  He was absolutely fabulous as Lestat.  He seemed more natural in the role than Tom Cruise had (though still great).  He brought to Lestat the beauty and sensuality I felt Cruise had not been able to completely perfect.  Townsend's Lestat is arrogant, sexy, and sleek.  Did I care that Townsend refused to bleach his hair blonde?  No way!
As for the DVD, I was delighted that it had as many features as it did.  Especially great (to me) are the Lestat music videos and the extended concert sequences.  As opposed to the soundtrack you can buy, these songs (as in the movie) all feature vocals by Korn's Jonathan Davis.  I especially found this interesting, being able to compare the renditions between the CD soundtrack and the movie.  So, if you're a Korn fan, I'd say this would be especially interesting to you.
Though I did not favor this movie over Interview With the Vampire, I still do love it!",1030838400,,1387,4.544354838709677

Many of the important details were either changed or overlooked entirely.  (The most annoying of these was Maheret's bleeding eyes.  It's mentioned once with no reason for it.  If I hadn't read the book that little detail would have driven me crazy).  I'd list the others but I don't think there isn't enough space.  The acting was adequate, just barely, and although Townsend was pretty he just wasn't Lestat (neither was Tom Cruise, but at least that was a good movie)  The only real fun was trying to figure out who the vampires were in the end.",1030838400,,703,4.4375

After watching about an hour of this movie, I had to shut it off before I started throwing things at the TV! I knew that important parts of the book would have to be left out of the movie, however I did not expect those parts to be replaced with NONSENSE. Having Marius make Lestat and teach him about the world seriously takes away from Lestat's character. The fact that Lestat had to learn about his vampire senses and powers on his own is part of who he is. Also I just can't believe Lestat would be the type to spend hours playing the violin just because he saw some girl playing it.  And Jesse-WHAT??? In the book she was a strong, intelligent woman, in this movie she was reduced to a childish obsessed fan. I might not have hated this movie quite so much if I had not read the books, however I still don't think I would have given it another star.",1030838400,,1001,4.186528497409326
1734672,5,B000069I5V,"Queen of the Damned is a fantastic film(for some) with lots of energy and spunk. Aaliyah is the best actor is the film playing the part of the evil Mother of all Vampires, Akasha. Aaliyah bless your soul and rest in peace forever. Stuart Townsend plays the wicked, devious, and sly vampire Lestat. Michael Rymer, the director, also does an amazing job with everything in the film.
The DVD of Queen of the Damned is wonderful. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is amazing. The DVD features include: AALIYAH REMEMBERED and 2 other documentaries, commentary by the director, producer, and composer, 13 additional scenes, 3 full-length Lestat music videos, extended concert sequences, gag reel, production book stills gallery, cast film highlights, and a theatrical trailer. Overall the DVD is A++ work.
Queen of the Damned follows Lestat into his acceptance in the tattooed and pierced world of being a gothic rock star. The movie goes deeper into how Lestat came to be through his journal found by a reseacher of the vampire who created Lestat. Lestat turns fellow vampires against him becuase he tells the world is a vampire and that vampires walk among humans. This angers the vampires because they do not want to be known by the humans. When Lestat awakens Akasha, the Mother of all Vampires, he is intoxicated by her and her powers.
The film has a lot more to it than that. This film is definately worth the rent but for some(like me) the buy. Its a great film with great actors. Hope you enjoy the film. Thank you for reading my review.",1030752000,,1548,4.737037037037037

I put the movie on mute and had subtitles so I could know what was being said without hearing satanic music by Marilyn Manson. I know this is based on the book but not by much. This movie could have done more with the book if it did less with the musical career of Lestat. The acting was good. If you want to see a vampire movie this isn't much of one either.

Even were one to forget about the book and watch it just as another movie, it would still have been absolutely atrocious.  I am usually nice to movies.  I go easy on most.

  Queen of the Damned, I believe, still stands on its own as a movie, it has a powerful cast and a great soundtrack! The story line has a bit of The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned mixed together, toss in a few special effects, which were also great, some good acting, and one or two of those SEXY vampire scenes, and....BOOM there is Queen of the Damned in a nutshell.
  All in all, I think I enjoyed this movie, aside from not staying true to the novels. I think it makes a good rental, it's just no Interview with a Vampire!",1030579200,,756,4.1931034482758625
1734679,1,B000069I5V,"I read ""Interview with the Vampire,"" ""The Vampire Lestat,"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" years ago.  Ann Rice's books were quite the rage at the time of their initial release.  She took such creative license with the vampire lore that she made it her own.  It was unique and fresh, at least ""Interview"" was.  After ""Interview,"" Rice seemed to be writing Harlequin Romance novels that simply supplanted vampires for real people.
The film version of ""Interview with a Vampire"" was extremely true to the book and had a really good script, sets, and excellent actors - best of all - an excellent director.  The film's most controversial casting was Tom Cruise as Lestat, but let's face it, the movie belonged to Brad Pitt and that movie loved him and he was perfect for it.
Hollywood skipped ""The Vampire Lestat"" and moved on to ""Queen of the Damned"" for some reason.  It should have left the rest of the ""Vampire Chronicles"" alone.  ""Interview..."" did the job quite nicely and to revisit the subject with other actors, writers, and director was a bad move.  The movie is no good.
But why?  It is faithful to the book on some key levels, but not in others.  That's often to be expected.  But why is it so bad?
Even when Anne Rice wrote this book, her ideas were already dated.  The idea that a vampire would be a rock star was old hat.  While not directly addressed as such, the film:  ""The Lost Boys"" all but made vampires rock stars - they certainly dressed and acted like them - in fact they were far more sinister than anything portrayed in this film.  Then there's the whole bevy of recent films (The Brotherhood, etc.) that those low budget studios have cranked out where the vampires are heavy on (homo)sexuality and good looks.  And finally, the whole subject of hip vampires has been completely (and much more effectively) addressed in the far more innovative and exciting television series:  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""
""Queen of the Damned"" is not really a horrible film if you think of it as made for television, but when you realize that this thing got tossed around Hollywood as one of the next BIG films, you'll be amazed at the poor quality involved.  The acting isn't bad and Stuart Townsend is a good choice for Lestat - but he's got that sort of generic ""hot boy"" look that so many of today's young actors have.  Aaliyah (no disrespect meant to the dead) is no actor.  She does her best, but her part was so poorly developed, we are not privy to the true intense evil that her character is to convey.
Ultimately, I think I can expound on the reasons that ""Interview with the Vampire"" was a success and this film wasn't.  ""Interview"" had the aforementioned cast, script, and actors, but it also had something that recent vampire films hadn't had:  It was a period film.  Dracula was a Transylvanian count and our rememberences of him are set in the 1930's.  Movies about vampires up to the 1970's had always addressed vampires in a period manner.  Beyond the 1970's several vampire films moved the action to the present and in doing so made the stories more accessible to a younger audience bored with black and white films and what they viewed as antiquated films.  But everything that is old is new again and ""Interview with the Vampire"" moved the vampire film back to its ""historical"" roots and gave us a grand costume epic of vampiric scale.  ""Queen of the Damned"" chose only to address the present and only skirted the period aspects of the story (granted I always thought the idea of an Egyptian vampire was beyond silly and was bored to death with the plotline in the novels).  The trouble with ""Queen"" was that it was almost a Cliff's Notes version of the story actually written by Rice and the characters were so superficially written that it was impossible to know what was going on if you hadn't read the books.
Why Anne Rice didn't kick up two times the fuss over this film that she did with ""Interview"" is beyond me.  This film shouldn't have been made, but if it had to be made, it should have been much better given all the built-in hype that it had and the budget it should have and did command.
Don't bother watching this movie - just look forward to new episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" for much better writing, acting, and directing.",1030579200,,4268,4.57161629434954

When I was inform that it was going to be made into a movie i was soo excited, but my blissful moment was soon to be destroyed once the movie started, it did not follow the book one bit. What the ... is up with Hollywood and Love stories?!! yo that was weak that they totally twisted the movie and turned it into a love story and compared to the book to the movie, the movie starts in the middle of the book.

1734698,4,B000069I5V,"I'm very upset at all the bad feedback and useless insults this is getting. I think this was a great movie, all in all. After all, you would never expect to turn J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings into an hour and something minute movie, so it's just as unfair to say that the makers of Queen of the Damned (the movie) did a horrible job creating a movie out of two large and detailed books.
Anne Rice's narration, although absolutely lovely to read, isn't the best or the easiest type to transform into a movie. You have to hand it to the screenwriters because it's a hard job. Anyone who's read the Vampire Chronicles would know that the narration is one of the best parts of the book, but you can't expect someone to make a movie with it, unless you want cheezy flashbacks and stage smoke.
I think the acting was very close to the characters they played (well, a lot of the characters were ignored as well, but honestly, it's only a 100 minutes!) and although the accents aren't well done (or existent, in Mr. Townsend's case) it fit the atmosphere of the movie. I agree with someone (I don't remember who it was who said it on these reviews) that this Lestat was better than Tom Cruise. In an Interview with a Vampire, Tom Cruise looked rather silly with bright blond hair and I'm glad they decided to let this Lestat have darker hair instead of looking very strange. I don't think this movie should get comments about him not having the right colourings because Akasha wasn't supposed to look like that, yet (the late) Aaliyah was cast for it.
Jonathan Davis was a very good choice in the singing voice of Lestat and I think that it fits well with the movie. The gore wasn't necessarily excessive at all, although there is that scene with the heart which is kind of...creative (for lack of a better term). Anyways, the special effects were (in my opinion) very good and there was a lack of mindless exploding cars in which I am so grateful that I would buy this movie on that point alone. I am planning on buying this movie as soon as possible, and I encourage you to do it as well, or at least try it before you mock it.",1030492800,10,2126,4.371212121212121

Some scenes were really good like the one where Jessie was given the choice in becoming the vampire. But the death of Akasha was awful! That was the most ruined scene in the whole movie. UCK!
If they make another movie out of any of Anne Rice's books I pray that they read it and remember the plot and any other important facts so that another mishap like this doesn't happen.
But on a brighter note, the performances of Stuart Townshend and Aaliyah were great. And the songs that I heard were good. But you'd have to read reviews from people who actually heard both of the CD's to know if they're good or not.",1030492800,2,803,4.282894736842105

It's Fun and campy in a way, it has a Rocky Horror vibe and the films music really sets a mood.  Stuart Townsend plays an excellent Lestat, and Vincent Perez as Marius is a delite to watch.
The DVD however features excellent extras including 3 full music videos shot for the movie by the actors.  I only wish music videos where so creatively and artistically done for television.  It is interesting to compare the one real music video by Static X to the 3 done for the film which are much superior.
There are 2 documentrys about the making of Damned one about the musical process, featuring interviews with the various artists that contributed to the soundtrack, which gives you a look inside the recording studio and how the score of the film was made.  The second documentry focuses on the Vampire special effects, specifically the use of wires and suspension cables, and an in depth look at the concert sequence, one of the more memorable moments of the film.  There is also a brief tribute to Aaliyah, featuring Stuart Townsend(Lestat), Michael Rymer(Director), and her brother among others involved in production.
This film is destined to be a cult classic for many reasons evident when watching the movie, but most of all because of Aaliyah's performance, which is haunting and chilling.  Her presence fills the screen and it is completely evident from the film that she was destined to be great, it is truely tragic that she only had such a short time.
The film provoked resonses of overwhelming love, or overwhelming hate from most people, and any film that can provoke such hightend feelings is one not to be missed whether you loved it or hated it.",1030492800,,1753,4.690553745928339

They reason being for this is at Lestat's concert, they just boom there they are, out of nowhere, the same thing happened when they killed Akasha. Scenes 8 and 9 stated who they where, that I did not find out until I watched scenes 8 and 9.

This movie was in no way, shape, or form either The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned.

I wish in the movie they kept Jessi dead like they did in the book because when I saw the very end I just had to puke. It was like some cutesy Disney movie. If they had Akasha's plan to 'make the world a more peaceful place' then the movie would have actually had some story. Aaliyah was so beautiful in the movie but she only had probably ten minutes of screentime. They didn't even explain HOW she became the first vampire. It's obvious they had to chop up the book so it wouldn't be a five hour movie, but if the major events that were in the book were in the movie, it would have been a lot better.",1030406400,,774,4.098684210526316

Stuart Townsend plays an excellent Lestat.  Aaliyah (God rest her soul)was ok as Akasha, but over all her part of the story was kind of weak.
The special effects were pretty cool, and the music was dark and creepy which set the tone of the movie very nicely.

Stuart Townsend is more Lestat than Tom Cruise was because Lestat is not in his thirties in the books he is late teens early twenties so Townsend fits. But it's just an adaptation. The books were very detailed and very well thought out Anne Rice is the most amazing author alive today but we only have less than two hours to make a movie. If they made The vampire chronicle the way they were written we'd have to make a lord of the rings type movie at best, Harry Potter, well I'll leave that alone. Aaliyah is amazing but the charater of Akasha does not look like that, I'm sorry but she doesn't. Making Marius Lestat sire was a good choice mainly because Magnus the creator from the vampire lestat was not in the story long enough to have a real effect. Where is my Gabrielle. My favorite character is Lestat's mother. She should have been in this one. Going back to my original point. It's an adaptation, there is nothing saying that we can't have another movie called the queen of the damned or the vampire lestat.

The only thing ""borrowed"" from the books were the names. If they were going to do it right, they would have made ""The Vampire Lestat"" and actually formed characters instead of making us guess as to who they were.
I don't like the fact that this was ""loosely"" based on her books. Wasn't the point of making the movie to actually be based on the book? Or did I not get that memo?
The characters were so underdeveloped it actually hurt to watch. The story was horrifying in the fact that it took aspects from both  ""..Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned,"" and actually put them together in one story line. What's the point? Why bother?
The acting was terrible. It was over-dramatic and over-played, and entirely too bloody for The Vampire Lestat. The screen play writers took the liberty of changing vital parts of the story line, so if they do (god forbid) decide to make ""Tale of the Body Thief,"" the story will be nothing like it's supposed to and make even less sense then this one. I'm already praying to the appropriate gods of movie-making that they decide against this idea.
If you've never read the books, I don't see how this movie could make any sense to you whatsoever. They explained absolutely nothing, gave us no background, yet expected us to understand the final product. I KNEW what they were getting at yet still felt utterly confused and unsatisfied at the end. I actually had to read the credits to see which characters they put in, and which they took out. And of the characters they did use, they didn't even bother audibly saying their names so we had no idea who they were.
And what of ""The Queen of the Damned""??? You think they'd actually put her in the movie for more than fifteen minutes. I don't think much of a Queen that can be taken down in 30 seconds. Oooh. Scary.
I'm certainly glad I didn't spend eight dollars to see this movie in the theatre and was smart enough to wait until I could watch it for free. I'm still wishing I could get that hour and a half of my life back, but at least I still have my eight dollars.

1734727,5,B000069I5V,"The Ancient Egyptians were unequivocally a Black people.  If their statues and shrines cannot convince you-->nothing will.  Nobody personifies the true essence of Ancient Kemites more than Aaliyah. Aaliyah's cryptic statue in the opening of the film and the revitalizing ""Those Who Must Be Kept"" scene, is a precise portrayal.  A picture is supposedly worth a thousand words, however, Aaliyah's glass portrait is worth more than a million.  Beginning with Aaliyah's haughtily condescending and enigmatic smirk, that is priceless.  Aaliyah's mystically lithic presence exudes strength, beauty, resolve, and haughty steadfastness.  They are some of the qualities that once inhabited many of the Black people of Ancient Kemet.
Moreover, an African folktale is evoked in Queen of the Damned and not surprisingly gone unnoticed by dismissive audiences and critics.
Here is a passage:
""Once all Africans could fly like birds, but owning to their many transgressions, their wings were taken away. There remained, here and there, in the sea islands and out-of-way places in the country, some who had been overlooked, and had retained the power of flight, though they looked like other men.""
...Read Between The Li-ines.
Aaliyah is the highest most exalted one.  Aaliyah's short screen time is a strong testament in it self because Aaliyah still embedded Queen of the Damned, contrary to popular belief, it is not because she made her early transition.
Rashad Haughton divinely induces consubstantiation from the interweaving of his soothing voice, that melds supremely with Aaliyah's crisp vocals.
Resplendent Aaliyah illuminates everything magnificent, beautifully brilliant, and the uncompromising wrath of The Sun.
More Than A Woman...
Aaliyah is another Scathing Shinning Serpent that is the vengeful eye of Ra. Aaliyah is the personification of the destructive sweltering rays of The Sun, whose aura permeates and pours out fire to scorch, sear, and consume, instantaneously, all the ones who disregarded the original teachings of The Sun.  Subsequently, the folly targets become obliterated.
Aaliyah plunges into her first destructive scene as effortless and graceful as the extraordinary birds of passage and prey.  Aaliyah is a true golden leonine goddess.  Aaliyah's divinely infused aura, with deep blackened eyes, are aroused to pleasure and immersing the vision after slicing through an insignificant bar that reeked of tainted specimens.  Aaliyah's supercilious demeanor is seductively spellbinding and extremely gratifying to see captured on film.  Suiting poetic justice.
Aaliyah's lusciously mesmerizing lips, as always, are superbly exquisite and reminiscent of her blazing Hot Like Fire video.  Moreover, Aaliyah perfects her fluidly insidious undulations where she slithers, slinks, and spits fire like the worlds most venomous, elapid, fierce snake: The Taipan of Australia, while emitting an exhaustive and poignant Breath-of-Death, like the burning winds that blow from the desert.  The execution is captivatingly unparalleled as System inoculates the atmosphere.  Aaliyah's translucent grin makes the revelatory sequence stunning and confirms its premonitory jolt.
The cinematography is outstanding.  Aaliyah radiates in her immaculately smooth bronze skin.  Finally, capturing and immortalizing the essence of true undeniable beauty of film.

And so is the movie version of Queen of the Damned.
The movie is fast, fun, sexy, and bloody -- just like her anti-hero, Lestat (Stuart Townsend), and villian Akasha (the late Aaliyah).
And like Lestat himself, the movie never takes itself too seriously, avoiding the overbearing morbidity and dullness of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire.

There is much left out in this movie, many characters not included. For example: in the Vampire Lestat, Marius was not Lestat's maker, Magnus was. It took years for Lestat to find Marius. The movie skipped over Lestat aiding Akasha with the slaughter of men and left out the eating of the heart and brain....
But there were so many characters in the two books, they had to either be left out or given a very small part. They weren't really necessary for this little story. And the explanation of the sisters who eat the organs of their dead would be too much to explain. That's a whole movie in its self.

I didn't want to be be a purist about it, having read and loved the two books on which it is based. However, in this film some of my favourite characters were massacred beyond recognition, and I don't mean the way they looked. Jesse? Oh dear. Marius! How could they have done that to Marius!!!
The whole love interest subplot destroyed the movies potential soul. The movie felt pointless. What was it about, in the end? None of the characters were strong enough to prop up this bumble of a movie.
Watching the commentary on the DVD helped me to understand why they had made some of the changes. I did appreciate the many special features accompanying the DVD. However, the terrible acting, ill-researched costumes and even worse script gave the film less life than it's characters. This film was not worth making like this.

Aaliyah as Akasha was talented as a bratty queen, though a more powerful screen presence would have been fitting.
Stuart Townsend's Lestat was skillfully acted but he came off a little too Trent Reznor for me.
Marguerite Moreau as Jesse did what the script required of her (poor girl).
Vincent Perez as Marius seemed to me to be simply a replica of what Tom Cruise was as Lestat to Brad Pitt's Louis in the first film. Campy, in a bad way.
Paul McGann as David Talbot was tight but underused.

As for the Ancients, Pandora (Claudia Black) seemed like she was in a school play (to her credit, her lines were abysmal), Lena Olin as Maharet was forgettable, Mael (Christian Manon) reminded me of Christopher Lloyd on tranquilizers, Khayman (Bruce Spence) reminded me of Christopher Lloyd on LSD, and Matthew Newton's Armand would have looked more at home as a hobbit in Lord of the Rings. Seriously.

One big plus this movie has is the music. It helps that I like the genre, great stuff. Johnathon H Davis and Richard Gibbs rocked my world.

The highlights for me would be the concert scenes (the extras were the best and most natural actors) and the music videos, which were well directed. It's a shame the same can't be said of this terrible film.",1029715200,,2162,4.637075718015666

Rather than focusing on Lestat the entire time, they should've awakened Akasha earlier and developed her character and relationship with Lestat even more.  Aaliyah & Stuart Townsend (""Lestat"") did a marvelous job of acting.  Aaliyah was perfect for ""Akasha"" because she has that mysterious aura to her (as a vampire does).

I take offense that they would so stray from lestat, above all others. and don't get me started on vincent perez as marius, its insane. aaliyah looked good as akasha but rather like an ornament, the writers didn't do justice to the true depth of akasha in this film. and why oh why is everyone old in this film? pandora is not supposed to be old and wise, she's young and wise as is maharet.
so basically they mangled it, its all wrong and louis and armand should absolutely be in the film. but at the same time these books are rather detailed and they'd need an 8 hour miniseries to introduce each character and add in all of their storylines as well. about half way through the film i stopped comparing it to anne rice's book and simply began to enjoy it as a film and decided i liked it. i enjoyed the girl that plays jesse, she brought a nice human element to the film -sensual innocence . i intend to get the dvd, like i said, stuart townsend grew on me......",1029542400,,1611,4.355481727574751

If you are a fan Anne Rice, and her beautifully written books then you don't need to see this movie in fact you'll be very disappointed if you do.  First it takes us from Interview with the Vampire and completely skips over The Vampire Lestat, which gives you a much better history of who and what Lestat is and his motivations in doing what he's supposed to be doing in this movie. This movie tries unsucessfully to give you history on Lestat while ignoring who The Queen of the Damned is.  The history on Lestat is completely differnt from the one in the books by the way.  And she comes off in this movie as a one dimentional villian, which if you've read the book is so far from what she was intended to be.  In the book you get a complete history of who Akahsa is.  The movie ignores her husband Enkil, and changes way too much of Lestat's history so that he is baerly reconginzable from the vampire in the Interview with a Vampire.  Aaliyah, and Stuart Townsend do the best they can with what they are given which isn't much.  Old favorites who are in the book are no where to be seen in this movie, such as Armand, or Louis.  We are never introduced to Lestat's mother Gabreille, or Mael, or Santano, or even Pandora.  The vempire Marius is completely unrecongzable from the book, and his history with Lestat is distorted and has been completely changed.  Who would believe Marius is supposed to have been a well educated, sophisticated, and noble Roman who was in his forties when he was made, and had long blonde hair. This movie is no where nearly as good as it could have been.  The time and effort taken to write and produce Interview with the Vampire is sorely lacking here.  Granted they didn't get everything right in that movie either, but at least they stayed within the heart of the book.  I'm sorry to say this movie doesn't do that.  Anne Rice's material deserved better and so did the late Aaliyah.  If you wanted to buy this in order to remember her contribution to the arts, you'd be better off saving your money and going to a record store and buying one of her CD's, or go out and buy Romeo Must Die, in which she was a fully realized character and gives the viewer a better representaion of what she was capable of, of the potential lost, and what we as a viewing audience lost when her plain when down.",1029196800,2,2372,4.359090909090909

Just the obvious fact that they went from Interview to Queen, skipping the middleman (Vampire Lestat) was a warning.  Yet I went to the theater, plunked down my five dollars, and spent the next couple of hours, as I'm sure most other Anne Rice fans did, in hell.  Grossly obvious mistakes (such as Lestat's maker) made me wonder if the screen writer or any other member of the crew had even bothered to read the book or The Vampire Chronicles itself in the first place. After walking out of the theater, I was so angry at the [translation] of such an amazing novel that I didn't even know where to begin in my criticism. I'm by no means a person who gets easily upset (especially by something as trivial as a film), but to put it bluntly, they slaughtered the book, seemingly taking the character's names and then doing whatever they wanted with them with no regards to the actual plot of the book.  However, if one can overlook the fact the movie was a terrible adaption and look at it in terms of just a regular film, then my criticism becomes a little less harsh!  Amazing special effects and dazzling performances by Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend make this movie worth the 2 stars I gave it. An unbelievble soundstrack compliments the film, and a very well-placed and appropriate Jonathan Davis cameo lightens the film's somber mood.

But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland.

And at that time the only book from the Vampire Chronociles that I had read was Interview With A Vampire, which I really liked.  Having liked QotD, I decided that I would pick up a copy of the next book in the series, the Vampire Lestat.  I quickly finished the book and traveled on to QotD.  After finishing that, I thought back on the movie and looked at some of the cast members who played major parts.  Well at least the ones that did in the book, but were not included in the movie.
My main problem with the movie is the casting.  They did a HORRIBLE job casting the people.  Im not saying that the actors that were chosen were not good actors, its just that they were not an acurate portrayal of the rich characters that Anne has introduced us to.  Maharet wasn't[ messed]up too bad, but I thought her look a bit younger.  Khayman does not look a thing like we were lead to believe he was! I can't decide if Khayman was portrayed worst of if it was Pandora.  I didn't like the choice of actress for the like second we see of Pandora in the movie.  She is my probably my favorite character in the chronicles. I was also puzzled at the decision to leave Mekare out of the movie.  Now seeing the movie without reading the book, you don't know what your missing, but after you read the book, you can't help but feel a little cheated by her exclusion.
Now, let me compliment the movie.  I really enjoyed Aaliyah's perrformance of Akasha.  I thought she did an excellent job.  Also, Stuart Townsend did a fabulous job of playing Lestat, to me he plays a more convincing Lestat than Tom Cruise did.  And the Soundtrack is one of my favorite soundtracks ever.
So, the movie was very good if you haven't read the books.  However, if you have you might feel a little cheated. I plan on purchasing the DVD when it comes out, because I still enjoyed it with its horrible casting and exclusion of major plot things.",1028678400,,1987,4.3126684636118595

I had already read, and purchased, all seven of the Vampire Chronicles by Mrs. Rice and purchased 'Interview with the Vampire' movie.  I was thrilled to find out they'd made a sequal.
In this movie, we are given a glimpse at the life of Lestat DeLioncourt, a famous and powerful vampire.  He is awaken from a deep slumber that all vampires must succomb to every few centuries by a rock group.  He finds the group and gives them a taste of his musical genious.
Flash forward to a press conference where Lestat is confirming his plans for a concert in Death Valley.  To conclude the conference he calls to all the ancient ones of his kind who believe he is insane and must be anihilated.  His songs consist of ancient secrets about the original two vampires and other things that the world of the undead wishes to keep secret.
Meanwhile, Jesse Reeves, a member of a paranormal investigation society, the Talmasca, is in a search for the famed Vampire Lestat.  She, unlike the public, knows his claims to being a vampire are real.  Against the wishes of the society head master, David Talbot, she goes to the Admiral's Arm, a vampire bar in London (I think that's were it is).  She claims to know the ancient Marius, who, in the movie, is Lestat's creator (But in the books it is a man named Magnus) and attracts some unwanted attention from rouge vampires.  But Lestat is at the bar and overhears her false claims.
He kicks the rouge's butts when they try to harm Jesse, and has an encounter with her that only fuels her fire of curiousity.
When Lestat performs his concert in Death Valley, many vampires bent on his distruction in the crowd, Jesse attempts to meet him.
Her great aunt, who is also a vampire, Maharet (Who in the books has a twin sister, Mekare), has reunited with other ancients such as, Pandora, Marius, Armand, Khayman, and Mael, are also in company at the concert.  But they do not wish to destroy Lestat as the others do.
Unfourtunatly, they are not the only ancients who have been awaken.  The famed 'Queen of the Damned' that Lestat sings about is also awaken from a two thousand year slumber.  She kills her 'husband' of sorts, Enkil, by brutally ripping out his throat.  She flys into the concert and wisks Lestat away.
I won't give away too much, so if you want to know more, I suggest you by the movie, as I will, on August 27.
I also highly suggest reading all the seven books in the Vampire Chronicles, by Anne Rice.

Not only is Louis not even mentioned in this movie, it seems that the script writer had such a high opinion of himself that he wrote this movie to be the only Vampire Chronicle. There is no indication in it that Interview with the Vampire ever existed.

The only reason anyone rates this movie high is because it was Aaliyah's last movie before she died.  However such an epitaph does not make a movie ""good"".  I understand creative license when translating a novel to the silver screen.  But I always thought that Queen of the Damned out of all of the Vampire Chronicles was written more as a movie format than any other.  I don't blame any of the actors from the first movie from passing on this one.  I wouldn't want my name associated with it either. I read Queen of the Damned years ago and have been a fan of the Vampire Chronicles since I read ""Interview"" when I was nine or ten on a road trip with my family.  I only hope that whoever gets the licensing for the Vampire Chronicles next actually reads the books and character descriptions before doing a casting call.  I felt that the Interview with the Vampire characters were really close to the visuals portrayed in Anne Rice's descriptions.  However in ""Queen"" they are very very very off.

It is obviously difficult to compress long; intelligent books with many characters into such a short film, But more could have been done with trhe characters they did decide to use. For example; Maharet, one of the eldest vampires continually bleeds from her eyes. To someone who hasen't read the book this will come as a complete mystery as to why this happens. Simple plot slices aren't explained. Possibly the most interesting and unique character in the book was Khayman. Who had an interesting and involving attitude and history; In the book he had an active part in the entrie outcoming. In the film: he is barely there. He stands in the background and does nothing. And the end of the film has almost no parrallel to the book whatsoever, and comes across as very anti-climactic.
  It's good points, (Yes, there are some) Were Marius; He was well played, with good character and attitude. Although i preffered the frightfully over-the-top performance of Tom Cruise, as Lestat after all; The whole character needs to be played over-the-top, Stuart Townsend was good, looking and moving correctly and actually pulled off the accent very well.  Aaliyah was a powerful figure as Akasha, The Queen of the Damned, Although her role did consist of little more than hissing dramatically and gyrating, she commanded screen presence very well. The soundtrack by Jonathan Davis was excellent, and not just good music, but lyrics that suit and correspond to Lestat's feelings. With songs about desire and alienation.
  All in all i liked the movie, I wish i was able to like it a lot more, As i did with 'Interview with the Vampire'. If the screenplay had been written by Anne Rice herself it would have come out considerably better. But for some reason the writers thought it better that she didn't.

The adaptation of the two novels ""Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" is very poor. The main points in understanding the reasons of Akasha's actions were left for you to know, above others things, but the thing that really killed the adaptation was the elimination of Mekare, Maharet's twin sister. Mekare was that fine line between the book and the movie.
Forget the origins of the other characters, if the producers and writers included Mekare, at least, they may had something for the viewer to do not look elsewhere. The relation between Akasha, Maharet and Mekare was the plot of everything, but they decided it was not important.
The FX were something really increidible, I must admit. The mix of sensuality and beast like actions were perfect. Though the make-up, they could have done something better.
The actors played their characters very well, specially Stuart Townsend and the late Aaliyah. He made Lestat the brat we all know and Aaliyah's Akasha was sexy, sensual and hypnotic. Her move in the vampire bar scene left with my jaw opened the whole time and her getaway made me scream.

I at first was in love with the whole deal, and I saw the movie a total of 8 times in the theater. Seeing the first movie then made me appreciate Queen of the Damned more, because i did not like the portrayle of Lestat through tom cruise. However, i then went and picked up the actual novel The Queen of The Damned and i was appalled at how much the movie was changed from the story. It was not just little things like the color of lestat's hair being drasically changed, no it was key elements. They completely cut out what half the book was deticated to, the origin of the vampire. The book was about Akasha ultimatly, but the movie was strictly for Lestat. They removed any sense of goal and reasons for Akasha and her actions, and in the movie when asked why she does what she does she simply replies ""Why not?"". There are holes in the plot, when compared even to the first movie. Such as the myth about if a vampire drinks a being of its last drop of blood they will die, but in the first movie they do this left and right! There is no mention of that myth in the book what so ever. What they should have done was let Anne Rice herself write the screenplay, as they did for Interview. Conculsion: Queen of the Damned the Movie and Queen of The Damned the Book are two very different but good stories.

With the overwhelming amount of source material to work with, you would have thought the producers would have come up with a more coherent movie, but instead we're given a mishmashed, choppy, confusing movie whose sets and costumes far outshine any of the acting or writing.  In fact, upon watching it it becomes blatantly obvious where 95% percent of the budget was invested.
This movie is not bad because it doesn't follow Anne Rice's book to the letter (which it sure as heck doesn't).  It's a bad movie because the script is abysmal, the editing was positively awful, and the acting, makeup and casting was less than stellar.

I own over 80 movies (classic and modern)and after watching Queen of the Damned, I was a little disappointed at first...because it didn't follow true to the book(s), but after seeing it a second time, I enjoyed it much better.  This isn't a typical vampire movie.  The characters showed a lot of heart.
Granted, there were many key elements that weren't shown (how the Queen and King were made into vampires, other characters in the book that weren't in the movie, the Legend of the Twins...none of this was shown), but overall this movie was very enjoyable.  The music definitely made the movie, which should've won best soundtrack of the year.
I thought that Stuart Townsend did a very good job as Lestat.  He captured his beauty, his cockiness and his power on the screen.  And besides, he's a far better looking vampire than Tom Cruise ever was.  Aaliyah also did a fabulous job as the Queen.  The part where she was stone and raised her hand for Lestat was very eerie and exciting...not to mention the bar scene where she makes her first entrance.

firstly, they actually skipped the second book in the series, ""the vampire lestat"" and just jumped into the third. i think they thought they justified it by meshing together both books but... heck, this is anne rice we are talking about! her books are nothing but full of plots...
i think the atmosphere is right though to convey the 80's seedy underworld... the dark watery alleys and all... but how come they dress like something out of the matrix... *all the time*? sheesh... stuart townsend is quite compelling as lestat, there are cetain scenes where he's really good...although somehow he doesn't live up to tom cruise (honestly though, i am NOT a fan of cruise) as lestat.
the plot itself is lacking... and all the vampires seemed to come from stereotype hell... can't they be more original, more than just gnashing jaws and flying cloaks (or in this case leather trench coats)? jesse acts like a half witted idiot, a wooden one at that. and they raved about aaliyah... i think she stinks. sad to say, that imho she can't really act, and if people think that walking around with bits of cloth plastered to her body equals to acting, i'd tear my hair out! and i think her rendition of akasha a bit weird though.. is that accent supposed to be an ancient egyptian talking in english? then how come everybody else sounds american? mystifyingly, if i'm not mistaken, townsend sounds british... weird for a french (since lestat *is* french) isn't it?
this is one movie i have seen in recent memory where the soundtrack is way SUPERIOR.. too bad they are not releasing the songs sung by jonathan davis in the movie... that would be excellent! so 2 stars are for the songs and some good moments for townsend.
i think it'd just whip out ""interview with a vampire"" for my fix... this - like another reviewer had said - is just B-grade material. at least IWAV have pitt, cruise, banderas, slater and co. to make my mouth water...",1026086400,2,2162,4.618181818181818

The fantastic soundtrack smoothes out many rough edges that could have detracted from the film.  Jonathan Davis of Korn provides the musical voice of Lestat.  Hopefully his record label will allow Davis' vocal tracks for this film to be released on cd one day.
The special effects are downplayed for the most part, allowing Townsend and company to be what Ann Rice's fans want to see:  Tough, cool, evil, and strangely sympathetic vampires!

  I liked it better the second time around, without all the nitpicking i did when i saw it opening night.  However i don't think this movie deserves the title it recieved, and soon enough will be buried deep in the archives of the old horror movies.
  Alyiha did a great job in the movie, she brought out all of the things you came to expect about Akasha from the books.  Stuart Townsend also did a very good job i think, though his portrayal was alot different than most people (includeing myself) expected.  I also enjoyed the actors that played Jesse, Maharet, and oddly enough Armand. He didn't have the red hair, or the dressings to make him very Armand looking (from teh book descriptions ofcourse) but he had the inocence that Antonio Banderas never captured.

The movie was, to me, a major disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, it was still a decent movie, but I guess my hopes were to high after reading the two books that it was based on.  The producers and directors were so worried about not making it a sequel to ""Interview With A Vampire"" that they ruined the plot.  They completely changed the movie, which is understandable due to the fact that the book revolved around many character's points of view, but the plot they created was ill-conceived and shabby.  The actors were all great, and it's a shame they were given such a sloppy movie to act in.  Aaliyah was great, even if it was hard to imagine the beautiful, skinny girl as a bloodthirsty killing-machine.  I won't spoil the movie, but I will say that it reflected the bad production of the movie when key characters from the book series were killed off without as much as two lines when they weren't even supposed die in the first place (Don't worry, it's not a major spoiler or anything, you probably won't even realize what I'm taslking about unless you've read the book).  I'm even a big fan of horror and vampire literature, films, and shows, but this film still let me down.

1734810,5,B000069I5V,"While quite openly bashed during its release, QotD is a good film.  Yes, it is a combination of The Vampire Lestat and the novel Queen of the Damned, but it produced an entertaining visual product.
  The story follows Lestat's rise to rock stardom while at the same time, Akasha (Aaliyah) is awakened by his music and becomes intent on ruling the world once again before she became one of ""Those Who Must Be Kept.""  Of course, both characters' sensuality causes them to cross and soon Akasha's will overpowers Lestat.  They want to rule the world together.
  Of course, I have only read half of The Vampire Lestat, and do have a copy of QotD, but overall, the film did stay true to the nature of the characters.  Stuart Townsend's French accent did take me by surprise at first, probably because I never really read the book with his accent in mind. (I HATED Tom Cruise's portrayal of Lestat, so I just made up my own accent.)
  Of course, the film did have it's flaws, like a seemingly
""quickie"" ending.  However, this came from the hype of Aaliyah's part in the film.  Because of that, I thought that she had an equaly large role as Townsend's.  My focus was shifted on to waiting to see her, that when I saw how few times she was on screen, it seemed like I was being shafted.  Then again, I wonder if Aaliyah were not dead, would there have been so much hype?  Mind you, I loved her performance, and it is a terrible shame that she died so early on in a budding career, but I doubt the movie would be as heavily pushed.
  There is also a character flaw that would go unnoticed unless one has read Rice's vampire novels.  There is a love scene between Lestat and Akasha, but according to the books, the vampires cannot couple due to the death of their human bodies.  It was still beautifuly presented, but I would substitute the background song, Change (In the House of Flies) by the Deftones to Tainted Love by Marilyn Manson, simply because I'm sick of Change...
  The cinematography was exquisite.  The bath scenes and tower scenes respectively are the absolute best.  The looming dark aspects to these scenes wasn't blatant or stupid; rather, they 'brought' me in.

Sitting thru that introduction to Lestat and his creation almost made me leave the theatre in disgust!  I decided to stick it out tho and after getting over the initial shock that I wasn't being treated to a true representation of the book I began to enjoy it a little more.
I really wanted to see something that followed on from Interview with the Vampire in style and direction.  That movie reflected the feeling in the novel really well yet in this adaptation they kinda did to Anne Rice what they did to Shakespeare with that Romeo+Juliet thing.  Kind of an alternative take on the book.  At any rate, I will take any opportunity to see Anne Rice's vampires come to life and can definitely say that this movie has one of the best soundtracks in the history of the universe.",1024531200,,1065,4.435897435897436
1734835,3,B000069I5V,"Anyone who is a fan of Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"" knows that the author herself oversaw much of the script writing of ""Interviw with the Vampire.""  Thus, aside from a few alterations (the most traumatic being the drastic changes to Armand's character), ""Interview"" followed as close to it's literary predecessor as most ""book movies"" can.
Not so with the tricky follow-up, ""Queen of the Damned.""  The movie is, at best, a shaky but fun rock'n'roll vampire movie that really has no true resemblance to its original form.  The biggest problem facing this interpretation of The Vampire Chronicles is that it attemps to amalgamate two separate books, ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned,"" both of which are longer than the book ""Interview"" on their own.  Most of the original story, centered around the origin of the vampires and the legend of the twins Mekare and Maharet, is missing.  Stuart Townsend is a rather corny and disappointing replacement for Tom Cruise, who, in my opinion, captured the character of Lestat perfectly.  The infusion of a pseudo-love story between Lestat and Jesse is also down-right atrocious, especially considering that it is David Talbot who, in the novels, eventally steals Lesat's undead heart.
Is there anything good about this movie?  Aaliyah.  She's beautiful, frightening, and the saving grace of this film.  The few scenes she has she performs with magnifiscent screen presence and mastery over her skill.  Aaliyah as Akasha is, perhaps, the best casting choice in this series since Kirsten Dunst's performance as Claudia in ""Interview.""
The supporting characters are also, surprisingly, just as wonderful.  Marguerite Moreau as Jesse, Paul McGann as David Talbot, and Lena Olin as Maharet are especially entcing.  They, along with Aaliyah, rescue what would otherwise be an incredibly disappointing film.
Overall, not as intelligent as ""Interview,"" but most of ""Queen of the Damned""'s faults lie in the writing and execution of plot.  Compared to the novel and the storyline set down in ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned,"" this movie is nowhere near the level of seductive, masterful writing that Anne Rice pens in her books and the screenplay of ""Interview.""  However, awesome special effects, sharp editing, and a stellar supporting cast lead by Aaliyah make this movie at least worth giving a chance.",1024444800,,2362,5.197889182058048
1734836,5,B000069I5V,"Well, since the video has not yet been released, I really can't say much on it. But I did see this movie in the theater and it was AWSOME!!! Stuart Townsend is great playing Lestat and they couldn't have picked a better person to play Akasha!! The whole cast was wonderful!!!
Now I know there are many things that are different from the book in this film, but on the whole, it followed the story pretty well. I do believe however, that it may be casier for those who have never read Anne Rice or have never seen ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994), to go and read The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned so you can keep the movie straight. It kind of goes fast, and there isn't much explanation as to how all this fits toether. So I do recommend reading those two books before seeing it.
But if you want to just see a great movie and not really worry about that, then I do encourage you to rent or buy this one!! It is full of things to get your brain working (hehehe), a little bit of romance (makes you say, ""Aww...isnt' that sweet?""), and all the vampires and blood you need to keep anyone hooked!!
Plus having a very HOT man to play the lead, it is an all around great film, and I definately recommend it to ALL the Anne Rice fans as well as anyone else who is looking for a film you can really sink your fangs into!! :) :)

1734837,5,B000069I5V,"""Queen of the Damned""
 I believe that this Film goes deep into the meanings and stories in ""The Vampire Chronicles"".  It is my opinion that the subject of this fill was mostly on Lestat played by the talented and sexy Australian actor Stuart Townsend the main character even though the Media portrayed that the main character was in fact Akasha the queen of the damned herself portrayed by Aaliyah.  It tells the story of the Lonely and brooding vampire Lestat after he has gone to sleep as vampires do, trying to drown out the sound of the growing world around him when something wakes him... music.  He becomes a Rock star with his mortal band and ""lives in the light"" in a sense.  But he still finds this life or un-life boring unfulfilling he wants someone to share eternity with a companion (Louis original position).
 The theme of the movie is simple the fight to stay interested in life or what is left of it on the earth so one is not to drive themselves insane with immortality.  All the vampires in this adaptation are trying to fight and find a way to deal with eternity.
 Actors and Actresses in the Roles they play are very well chosen.  The movie being a low-budget fill compared to films in the U.S. today the maker's or Queen of the Damned actually spent about half the normal movie budget.  Most of the actors were in fact from Australia and movies are made for smaller amounts of money there.  The acting was wonderful all characters fit their roles perfectly the accents for the origins were better then in Interview with the vampire.  Exception for the accent of Akasha who sounded very Hungarian or Slavic, but as is the world has yet to discover what Ancient Egyptians sounded like.
 The Dialogue from the fill followed the books actually story line.  This time around Anne Rice did not write the script as it was in Interview with a vampire.  There were some minor changes make but they were insignificant to the movie it self.  The Changes were mostly made because like all good books that are made into movies some corners have to be cut and since this movie was a combination of two books ""The Vampire Lestat"" & ""The Queen of the Damned"".  There were a lot of details simple left out to simplify the story.
 The setting for the movie was the modern day gothic scene.  The locations for the movie were all around a Desert, Death Valley, Hollywood, and England.  The scenes also surprisingly go along with the story and since Vampires can Travel very quickly there were no long and drawn out travel scenes.
 The Lighting as in all Vampire movies was dark and reflected the mood of the entire movie... Dark.  The movie was meant to be this way I don't think it is meant to scare but let the imagination run wild with the possibilities of things going bump in the night and maybe that shadow did move while you were walking to your care in a very ""dark"" parking lot.
 I found the sound to set the moods of the movie when the big concert scene was coming up the sound gradually became louder.  But to get the full affect of this movie you defiantly have to see it in surround sound.
  The music for this movie was gothic and Rock bands such as
Static-x, Disturbed, Linken Park, Marilyn Manson, Orgy, Papa Roach, Deftones, Disturbed, Earshot, Godhead, Kidneythieves, Tricky, and Dry Cell came out for the Queen of the Damned Soundtrack.  In the movie the voice of Lestat the Rock star was sang by Jonathan Davis who also makes a cameo appearance as a ticket scalper in the movie for The Vampire Lestat Concert.  The music very much fit the movie and the disturbing lyrics sound like the undead actually wrote them.
 I found that the Cinematography in the movie could have used some work I thought that some of the camera angles should have showed one character so you know what's going on with them while the other characters are the main part of the action at the time.  I also found that it seemed to get better thought out the movie so maybe the camera guy took some classes or something.
 Special effects although they were far and few between brought to the movie never distracting the audience but bringing them more into the film and believing that this could possible happen in the modern world that there is a  stranger sitting behind you that could jump out and any second and it frankly frightens you and gives the culture a chance to look into the shadows.
 Editing now this is something I did not approve of I thought that the movie should have at least introduces that Vampires Armand, Mael, Maharet, Pandora, and Khayman.  Two of these Vampires are destroyed in the movie and there parts could have been much greater.  But all that got to the cutting room floor before it made it to the can.
 The over all Directing was wonderful the actors never seemed to be lost in the thought that they didn't know what to do next.  They seemed to remain in character at all times never breaking their very distinct accents.
 Over all I would give this movie an A not an A+ because the lack of other character involvement.  I thought The Queen of the Damned lets the normal everyday person rethink there life and what it would be like not to have it.  The best way I can some this up is that you have to see this movie it is by far the Best vampire movie I have ever seen and even if you don't enjoy vampire movies, It has something for the everyday person Romance, Small Comedy, Action, and Drama.",1024358400,7,5420,4.474059003051882

Marius made Armand and he got killed.  So, other than that I loved it. I definitly want to own this.  Read the book, the Vampire  Lestat and the queen of the Damned.  You will be Hooked.

The only thing that kept me in my chair was the music..and plus i am a devout Aaliyah fan. The music made the whole movie..Track after track. The casting was very goood.

When I saw Aaliyah, as the beautiful Akasha, walk into the room for the first time in the bar scene, I thought ""That is the creepiest person I have ever seen, but at the same time the most beautiful"".
The film did not make that much at the box office, but when it comes out on video and DVD, everyone will own a copy. Not just because of Aaliyah, but because of the spectacular soundtrack that made the movie flow so beautifully.

I wasn't expecting alot when I heard they were making Queen into a movie.  I liked Interview, and I, for some reason, thought that the ""sequel"" was going to be somewhere along the lines of the first movie.  However that was not true.  In fact, it looks like they did everything they could to pretend Interview was never made into a movie at all.  Even before the movie came out I saw who they had cast for the roles and I wanted to cry.  It was just horrible!  They completely changed the entire plot of Queen, and made an even bigger mistake when they tried to incorporate The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned into one movie.  They wrote out half of the characters, and the ones they did put into the movie didn't even look like they were supposed to.  Seriously, how much would a bottle of hair dye cost?  I'm sure fans of the chronicles would have been glad to donate a few dollars if that is what it took to get Lestat's hair blond, and what about Marius?  He didn't even have hair at all!  The script was unbelievably cheesy.  I am just afraid that people think this is what the books were like!  The acting wasn't the best it could have been, and though Stuart may have been handsome, he was still a horrible Lestat.  They made Akasha look like a stripper, and it's a bit hard to be afraid of someone when they are dancing around in a bikini.  Over all I thought the movie was a huge waste of time and money.  The script was absolute trash and some scenes were so awkward I laughed out loud.  As far as I am concerned this movie was a big joke.",1022371200,3,1728,4.184848484848485

Not to mention the huge distortion the film of who made Lestat and how as compared to the brillant book.  I hoped it would be more true to the novel, but as just a movie it is well done.  Pyrokeneisis, flying, and bloodsucking make for some interesting characters.  Not to mention the bitchin' sound track.

Stuart Townsend makes Lestat come alive.  Something Tom could never do.  Stuart brings out Lestat's true personality that of a sensual predator who only thinks of himself.  As for the sountrack which is also great is arranged well and adds great texture to the film.  I give this movie two thumbs up.

The only thing that got me was this: What you KNOW is that the title, ""Queen of the Damned"", suggests that Aaliyah has the big (better yet biggest) part in the movie. What you DON'T KNOW is that Aaliyah is in the last half of the movie. Well, with the part she was given Aaliyah was fantastic. Overall, ""Queen of the Damned"" is well-worth a watch.

In the past month or so I have read the first three chronicles and am now on the fourth.  It has bothered me tremendously how the movie seems to simply use Anne Rice's characters with a completely different story.  I think the producers wanted to make the movie easier to understand, though it made me confused once I read the books.  I mostly would like to know what Anne Rice thought of the movie.  The characters were PERFECT, I can't think of one who I would picture differently.  So Marius isn't what most would expect.

1734890,3,B000069I5V,"""Queen of the Damned"" (2002)
Queen of the Damned could well start a new genre: campire. This is a mix between a camp movie and a vampire film. While this films predecessor Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles took more insight into what it is to be a vampire and made the story very believable, Queen of the Damned is vamp camp that serves no real purpose except to entertain. This isn't going to change your life or win any Oscars, but you'll probably find yourself thoroughly entertained when it's over.
The movie had lots of thorough good points: sound and sound editing, acting, direction, pace, chilling effects and heaps of cool settings. However, it received bad word of mouth and I don't really understand why. The movie clearly wasn't made to be the next Citizen Kane, and that's what I thought when I went into this film. I was thinking to myself that for sure the movie isn't going to be perfect or a next Citizen Kane on those grounds and it isn't. But it exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a fun flick.
Queen of the Damned will make a lot of money due to Aaliyah's death. Her character isn't in the movie as much because she died tragically before the end of the shooting, but I really don't understand what everyone is whining about. We get enough of her. She is in the movie for over 30 minutes. Okay, we don't get as much insight into Akasha and we don't get as much of Aaliyah as some may have liked, but we get her in the middle and end, and that's how the story goes in the book. So why the whinging?
Speaking of Aaliyah, I would just like commend the now deceased actress-singer for her excellent performance. She pulled it off like I never could've imagined. It turns out Aaliyah really studied into her character; her screen presence is terrific. She also has a fabulous vampire-esque accent, she preys and pounces very well and, my favourite personally, the way she moves as Akasha is breathtaking. From dancing sensually, flying and just plain walking every way that Aaliyah moves is arousing, erotic, scary and very monster-like. It is a shame such an extraordinary talent died at such a young age. Hell, if Aaliyah hadn't died we could be hanging out for her on Oscar night in years to come! Halle Berry did it, why not Aaliyah?
As for her supporting actors, Stuart Townsend was also very good. His accent was a little irksome at times but I very much enjoyed his monologues and expressions. Margeurite Moreau looks like a cross between Frances O'Connor and Mira Sorvino and I really liked the way she acted. She isn't as spectacular as the two actresses I just mentioned but just quietly she has talent. Vincent Perez gives my second favourite performance of the film (2nd only to Aaliyah). He is perfect for the role of Marius and I would love to see him take more monster-like characters. I am not really sure why the heck Lena Olin was in here in the first place, but this role is just far too easy for her.
The direction and editing of the movie is similar to The One, except it fits the atmosphere better. There is a lot of usage of slow motion and zoom shots, but unlike in The One, they aren't overstylised so much. It actually looks really cool the way the vampires blur through the air as they fly. The interesting special effects don't bring anything new but I enjoyed seeing some cool techniques used in the film.
This movie won't disappoint horror gurus either. It has a heart being ripped out, beheadings, truckloads of blood and guts, and plenty of other things to satisfy all teenage guys. Speaking of teenage guys or any guy out there for that matter, Aaliyah is a doll to look at in this film. She wears very short and sexy costumes (done very appropriately by Moulin Rouge designer Angus Strathie) and shows off her body a lot. She gets to wear a lot of makeup too. Stuart Townsend is shirtless for at least a quarter of the movie for the ladies.
I have mentioned nothing bad about this film yet. It is not by far perfect. It has its flaws. The script doesn't have enough meat to it, and neither do the characters. I would've liked to learn more about Akasha and less about Lestat in this movie. In Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Lestat was developed to 3-dimensional and I would've liked to learn more about the title role. The romance story is pretty much just chucked into the movie without chemistry or development either. Also, the humans in the film sometimes do stupid things. Margeurite Moreau's character at one point goes into a bar infested with vampires who can probably smell whether she is one of them or not. And at the rock concert wouldn't the audience be starting to get a little freaked out when audience members suddenly go flying out of the ground and start fighting with the man on stage? Even if it was a concert where anything can happen, even I could've noticed that there was something fishy going on and better get out of the place, fast. The mortals barely move when a vampire is on them, when they should be running like heck. Also one thing that is reasonably common in all thrillers lately, the ending [stinks]! The ending for this movie just didn't do it for me. It was repetitive and the scriptwriters could've come up with something far more charismatic and original. Or could they?
This movie turns out to be an above-average movie with a few flaws (some intentional) and a couple of silly turns. For all its mistakes though, the entertainment value remains. I guess the best way to sum up Queen of the Damned is that it is like an extended rock music video: extremely loud, slick, cheesy, flashy and yet still so fun you can't help but sing along.

1734891,4,B000069I5V,"Being a Vampire Chronicles fan and after hearing the various rumours on the internet I didn't really expect much from this film, at best I thought it was going to be an OK Goth rock movie that looks like a MTV video.
So what is it? It's a very good Goth rock movie that looks like a MTV video. So all good there. But what really surprised me was that it's actually a lot more similar to the book than I expected or than other people have been saying. Most of the events excluding flashbacks where included, sure there are a lot of minor changes but none that detract from the story, and the major changes: Lestat's relationship with Jesse, and the way Akasha was defeated actually improve the film and where done really well.
The only problem I have is that without reading the books I wonder just how much of the story would make sense because I do believe it relies too heavily on the viewer to fill in the gaps based on what they've read in the books.
BTW - Stuart Townsend is very good as Lestat although did he remind anyone else of Brandon Lee in the Crow?",1019088000,,1062,4.262376237623762

I have also read the book, and I must admitt, the movie was completely different. Over 7 characters were missed out. However, I did enjoy this film a lot. Aaliyah portrayed Akasha, the Queen of the Damned. Although only in a few scenes,she actually scared me with her evilness! I don't think anyone else could've done a better job. Stuart Townsend played Lestat, and captured his character perfectly... not forgetting the fact that he's extremely good looking!

I was absolutely disgusted with this movie. I was skeptical about this movie from the moment I heard is was being made. How can you make QOTD into a 2 - 2 1/2 hr. movie without cutting more than half of it out? I knew that things would be omitted and changed somewhat like it was done with Interview... but this is ridiculous. First, Lestat was NOT made by Marius. Second, only one twin? Third, after drinking Akasha's blood Lestat is able to wake in the sunlight? WHAT?! Fourth, the ancients killing Akasha and some being destroyed in return? Fifth, romance between Lestat and Jessie? Sixth, Jessie made by Lestat at the end? And what was with Akasha and Enkil looking like white statues down to hair, jewelry and clothes? Anne Rice describes their skin looking like alabaster and the only thing that hinted to their being alive was their flowing garments and their black hair. I could just go on and on about the changes made to the original story but to any REAL Anne Rice fan out there, these changes will be all too painfully obvious. I could also mention the horrible portrayal of the characters but hey, not every actor is worthy of the name, right?
If you haven't read the Vampire Chronicles and are under the age of 21, this is the film for you. If you are a VC fan, I would tell you ""save yourself the pain and anger of seeing this film"" but I know you'd want to see it for yourself anyway.

I prefer him most certainly to Tom Cruise in the Interview with the Vampire. In general I have to say that the casting was done extremely well as well.

1734895,5,B000069I5V,"I really enjoyed the movie and feel head over feet for Lestat, at the time I loved the movie and I still do then I got the book the Vampire Lestat and was confused with the Magnus/Marius bit and I missed having Nikki and Gabrielle in the story as I thought they played a important bit in Lestat's character, I loved the way Anne rice writes, how she makes you feel for the character what Lestat feels, How I felt very compassionate when it came to Louie and Nikki but I never really loved Armand even though I grew to like him in the Queen of the damned book with his involvement in the night Island and the reporter off interview with a vampire. I really missed the back-story of Mekare and Maharet as it played an important piece of the puzzle concerning several characters. And it never tells you Akasha's plan, her ultimate plan for the world and portrays her not as a false deity who wants a world of her own utopian mind but a evil mother of vampire's intent on killing humans, which leaves her standing with the ever movie constant plan of taking over the world it never deepened her reasons.
I was confused about the Marius looks bit, but wasn't bothered as I liked the Actor who portrays him, I liked the movie writers adding in his paternal instincts towards Lestat I thought the Idea of Incorporating that was very smart with the new idea that he made Lestat and him coming to the rescue at the concert.
I agree that I think some background info on Armand, Mael or Khaman would have been nice and I miss Louie and Gabrielle's input in the end.
I thought the love story between Jessie and Lestat was nice even though it was not in the book and I was sad when Lestat and Jesse never got together in the book, But I still love Anne Rice's style of writing and even though the English was complex you fast adapted to her way of writing and enjoyed it.
I think they pretty much nailed the casting accept with some of the vampires like Mael and Marius, I love Stuart Townsend playing Lestat and thought Maharet, Pandora, Armand and Jesse were also really good to. In fact all the Characters are very good in the movie.
I over all loved the movie and the books and I am sad to say I have yet to read the first book and have read 2 and 3, but I am trying to find it. I know my review is more book orientated, but honestly if you love the movie the book fulfils the lack of Information in the movie and makes you love the movie and the book with such strong emotion you will be dreaming of Lestat and the other characters for nights to come.
I strongly recommend seeing the movie and reading the books, screw the nasty movie critics, be the judge for yourself, my best friend despite my efforts won't see it cause his friends sais it [stinks] and I am still trying to get him to have an opinion of his own.

Stewart Townsend did an amazing Lesat. And Aaliyah was the best choice for Akasha. I can't think of anyone who could have done  better.

Stuart Townsend is Lestat and he does it 100 times better that Tom Cruise, who was only cast for star power. The late Aaliyah captured her character Akasha brillantly and proved just how great of an actress she really was. I hated Akasha all because of her talent.

I even liked Marius as the ""maker"" of Lestat better.  Aaliyah (remember folks, she was only 22) did a great job and Stuart Townsend just blew Tom Cruise out of the water.  He really made me believe he was Lestat.  The goth music was perfect and the concert scene was great.  I was also pleasantly surprised how Akasha was destroyed.

Only one twin, Marius's heritage & hair is wrong & he's ugly, lots of ugly bald vamipres which in the book was against the rules, no return of Louis, Jessi & Lestat are not even supposed to get along, Louis was supposed to leave the story with Louis, Marius did not create Lestat, Lestat is not supposed to be a brunette Russian, Townseed's portrail of Lestat was WAY off, & Akasha's death seen was pathetically overdone. & that's just a FEW examples.

I don't even read Rice, I can't, she's too *dull*! IMHO, a Movie is much better based, YES BASED On a book rather than follow that book too the T.You can not go too a movie and expect it too be JUST LIKE the book. Was Blade and Blade 2 JUST like the COMIC BOOK? Was Nosferatu just like its Original Book Too?And my friends the story of Dracula has been messed with so much in book and in film and just about everything, that its hard too know what's what. It's sad because today's gen X doesn't even probally know Dracula is based on a REAL person! However, I digress. QoTD Kicked [Buttox], then again I am of the MTV generation! true, the way they portrayed Akasha..No Real Egyptian queen would have worn what she wore, there's always a fixture with them and they have Lapis In their headdress and akasha had none, and not all egyptian queens were brown skinned or african american either..some of them were of Arayan Blood. But they worked well with what they worked with. Don't go looking for the mind of anne rice because you won't find it, but it was much more industrial and REALITY based than Interview was. It was set in today's world, and that's something anne rice has a problem with keeping. When people write vampire fiction, they have too give them ""life"". Rice gives hem depth, and history, but then they just drop off, there is no life.

However I did watch the first movie ""Interview With The Vampire"" with Tom Cruise as Lestat... In my opinion Stuart Townsend, who plays Lestat in Queen of the Damned, did a much better job than Tom Cruise ever could have... Stuart's smooth performance was, without exaggeration, Intoxicating...
I had never heard of him prior to seeing this movie, but he is now one of my favourite actors...:)
To be honest, the first time I watched the movie, I thought it was quite low quality, but when I got home from watching the movie, I had an undeniable urge to go see it again... So I went again, and again, and again, I cant praise this movie enough, it undoubtedly exudes a uniquely captivating style.. I think most of all it is the sexy quality that Stuart Townsend possesses that draws you want to see the movie more than just once... ON THE BIG SCREEN!!!
The soundtrack to the movie is great, it fits the mood and style of it perfectly... The other actors are not without talent either, One of my favourite actors - Vincent Perez pulled off Marius (Lestat's maker) quite well to my surprise, and Aaliyah was without doubt electrifying in her Dominanting character (The Queen of the damned) .... Well done to all those who were involved in the production of this movie.. You have made a fan out of me!!!

I don't know if it was just the way she talked or walked or what but she was just not a good actress to play this character. Over all, the movie went fast and was to the point which was a plus over Interview and some of the special effects were excellent.

I am also an Anne Rice fanatic, have read all of the books more than once, and to me, the movie doesnt tarnish the novel at all, the movie adaptations are SUPPOSED to be different from the novels.  I do think they did a great job of creating the sexy, dark atmosphere that this type of movie requires.

When you base a movie on a book, the outcome on the screen is not going to be identical. New twists, and new characters are essential to make a movie better for it's targeted audiance.
I loved this movie. This isn't because i'm an MTV fanatic. That is not the case at all! While this movie targets a young audiance, it doesn't attract teenie-boppers! N'Sync fans (Preppy girls and boys) would soon be sickened at the sight of Akasha munching on a bloody heart. The audiance this great movie captured was teens like me, who like Tim Burton, the music from the soundtrack, and aren't scared of walking into the store Hot Topic.
The soundtrack to this great movie is the best soundtrack for any movie ever!! The music by Jonathan Davis (Korn) performed by Chester of Linkin Park, and bands like Disturbed, Orgy, Kidney Theives, and Static- X , among others, makes this movie popular among teens who love this type of rock.
Vampires, to many, are beautiful evil creatures of old tales. This also attracts some goth fans for the movie.
So, why does everyone hate this movie? People that are old enough to be my parents shouldn't really rate this movie. They may know about their Oscar winning drama's but they know nothing about what teens are into these days.
The movie provides a more than awsome soundtrack, it has butt-kicking concert scenes, awsome matrix-looking moves by the vampires, romance, suspence, and every character has a bit of attractive mystery behind them. So what if it didn't mention every detail of the books? I'm not saying this because I've never touched the Vampire Chronicles. In fact, I've read them. I'm a fan of Ann Rice. So although it didn't stick straight with the story in the book, it made it's own story, which was better on screen than the book would have been. Adding in Jesse and Lestat's relationship at the end, made an even happier ending, which is alwasy welcome on screen. The soundtrack with it's  melodic music made it even better to see.
I went to the movies to see it already knowing the songs. Soundtracks are always a plus to a movie!! On the movie the songs were played by Korn, and on the soundtrack by differen't artists! This makes me anxious to get the DVD which may have the Korn versions with the music videos, then I can listen to my soundtrack, and enjoy them both.

Sorry Anne, dear, but... The movie was TOTALLY untrue to the book. It barely even followed the storyline. Two half-steps further, and it would have been impossible to use the name ""Queen of the Damned"" without facing copyright laws. And, that aside, it still had flaws. It was overdone completely. Very few rock singers wear the tight leather pants. Now, granted, the book was set in the 80s, but the movie, most obviously, was NOT. Also, the way the fans dressed. Their hair, and their clothes... TOTALLY stereotyped. I know VERY few of my friends who actually look like that. And trust me, I hang out with just the kind of people you would find at that kind of concert... And also, the way some of them acted. Like one of the girls who went into Lestat's house. She dressed like a Goth, but acted like a cheerleader. And Jesse and...Jesse's aunt didn't look like I imagined. Their hair was too auburn, too... straight, whereas in the book, they are described as bright red and curly. Also, in the movie, there was no mention of Armand, or Louis, or Gabrielle, or Claudia. And Marius did NOT make Lestat. They twisted the stories ALL around, and being a hardcore bookworm, this REALLY bothered me. The whole time, I was leaning over and telling my friend how things REALLY happened.

1734934,5,B000069I5V,"""Queen of the Damned"" is based on Anne Rice's endless Vampire Chronicles. I read the book and the movie wasn't really like the book. But it was still great and very erotic and entertaining. I did got scared in a few parts, but the movie was not scary. It was still great to watch. Most people will be dissapointed to see that Aaliyah isn't really in the movie as much as the previews make it seem. At first she appears as a statue and you only see flashes of her. Then she shows up for one scene at a bar where she burns the bar all up and battles with other vampires. Then at the end she shows at a rock concert that the vampire Lastat is performing at and then she takes him and the ending arrives soon with the last battle. Stuart Townsend played a better Lastat than Tom Cruise did. The soundtrack was awesome and the movie just rocked. Also, the beginning of this movie is the beginning for the book ""The Vampire Lastat"" and not from the book ""Queen of the Damned"". I highly recommand it to everyone and I really loved it.

But if you don't like vampires or music, then don't go to see this one. I still can't see how the critics gave this movie a D, but it was number 2 in the box offices. So if you like goth stuff, then see this movie!",1016841600,,391,3.9
1734936,3,B000069I5V,"i went into this movie with the knowledge the book would not be found on screen.  Aside from Stuart Townsend's dead-on interpretation of Lestat, the movie was lacking in many ways.  The real shame is that a mini series could not have been done.  To attempt to put 4000 years on the screen with multiple plots in an hour and a half is not doing justice to the author's work.  Any true fan of Anne Rice knows that her books are read multiple times together to completely understand all of the meanings of the lives of her characters.  This was not the appropriate setting for this particular chronicle.  How about Tale of the Body Thief?
I would continue to see Lestat on screen only if Stuart Townsend played the character.  He was fabulous in his interpretation.  You could not decide if you wanted to punish him like a child or wish your name was Jesse.  I know people that are down right possessive of who Lestat is and how he should be interpreted.  I agree that Stuart Townsend was cheated with the script handed to him.  I look forward to seeing him elsewhere.
All in all, and entertaining movie.  Remember, it is just a movie.  The book is always better(as it should be)",1016668800,2,1176,4.464788732394366

The movie was definatly something to keep you awake during it because of its volume and suspense. This movie was so good that I wanted to read Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Anyway heres to the Review.
The movie starts out with Lestat (Stuart Townsend) waking up from a decades long slumber and determined to make himself known to the world but while he is doing this he awakens a long lost friend....The ""mother"" Akasha (Aaliyah). The elders are up to thier necks in trouble. While Jesse is in love with Lestat and wants to live with him forever.
The cast to this movie was a 8 out of 10. I thought Stuart Townsend was perfect for Lestat, Loud , irresistble and alot of experience (first movie dating back to 1996) Vicent Perez however, needed work, he would have been a great Marius if only they added long hair. I thought Aaliyah was perfect for Akasha, and she did very well for being inexperienced (god rest her soul)but, overall the casting was good.
I am waiting for this movie to be released on video/DVD...",1015459200,,1200,4.4343891402714934
1734953,1,B000069I5V,"I'm a gracious fan of Anne Rice, and as said before they hacked the book horribly.  I anticipated the release of this movie, because i love the vampire chronicles.  Yet on opening night they just killed it. I bet the  movie was great for those who never read the book or loved it.  It bothered me that Marius was said to have made Lestat.  Or that they never made a reference to Louis or Claudia, saying he was always alone.  Or the time he spent with Armand.  Where was Mekare...  The ancients were never named in the movie.  Something else agitated me was the fact is that they made it a love story of Lestat and Jessie..
Oh well, I know I'm not alone in my feelings.  Not that the movie was all that bad, but I just really loved the book...",1015372800,9,743,4.169014084507042

At first I thought, ""You gotta be kidding me"", then I had to take a moment and process it all after I went home.  The movie lacked in a lot of ways but the script was it's most profound enemy.  Never had I read such frivolous drivel in all of my life.  The characters were not at all developed.  I thought there was too much going on.  When it came to where the Queen makes her grand entrance, there was no build-up and it all seemed anti-climatic.  Poor Stuart Townsend got ""hosed"".  Aaliyah was great but her role was sooooo minimal I almost felt like finding the studio heads at Warner Bros. and smacking them silly.  Everyone knew her part wasn't a large one, yet the studio promoted it as if it were all about her.  If anyone had read the book they would have known otherwise.  It is a shame that such a talented woman had to be associated with such a piece of work.  This movie could have been so much better and with little effort.  I am deeply disappointed but I will say compared to other vampire movies, this is a keeper.  I don't know what that says, but I honestly think that--Go Figure!",1015372800,,1217,4.163090128755365
1734955,4,B000069I5V,I am a vampire fan and vampire movies are my favorite.  But this movie needed more detail.  Like how did Akasha become queen and how did she get her king.  The legend behind Akasha.  It was nice to tell us about it.  But if the movie was going to concentrate on Lestat and what made him famous and how and who bore him. They could at least came up with how Akasha played by Aaliyah became who she was.  Like I said need more detail.  And there was not enough struggle on how Lestat became a rock singer.  We all know that it's hard in the show business world and there was no struggle at all to how he became a rock singer.  The movie just wasn't complete.  It missed out on crucial detail.  But in general I do like the movie.,1015286400,,727,4.049295774647887
1734956,3,B000069I5V,"If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth-fest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience.  A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, ""Queen of the Damned,"" directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.
 The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been ""asleep"" for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate.  What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome.  And he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms.  Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known.  He presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.
 Lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who ""made"" Lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert.  And they are not going for the music.  But there is something else, as well:  At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the ""Mother"" of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King:  Lestat.  And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be in attendance, without fail.
 Make no mistake, this is Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, ""Interview With the Vampire,"" or ""Bram Stoker's Dracula.""  He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect.  In the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff.  There's some good F/X on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern.  It's a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.
 In ""Interview With the Vampire,"" Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly.  He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing.  It's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.
 As Marius, Vincent Perez does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with Perez's performance, which is quite good.
 Turning in noteworthy performances, as well, are Marguerite Moreau, as Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's Aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha.
 And as Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence.  What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty.  And, tragically, she has left us much too soon.
 The supporting cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy).  With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans, especially, will be pleased with ""Queen of the Damned,"" a film nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast.  By focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, Rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1015286400,5,5050,4.630044843049327

1735000,3,B000069I5V,"Queen of The Damned for all its flaws is a surprisingly good movie. I enjoyed the movie right up through the concert scenes and if the movie had ended there it would have been a far greater success. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters seemed to have no idea on how to end the movie. The entrance of Akasha in the film although quite dramatic at first quickly fades due to a lack of character development. We never know Akasha's motives and reasons for wanting to pursue her goal of world domination and we never get to know any of the characters that show up at the concert. Maharet, Pandora, and Armand seem like nothing more than afterthoughts which is quite a disappointment considering how well they are developed in the novels. The whole movie seemed to go by too fast. It could have easily been given another half hour to forty-five minutes, which could have clarified the glaring holes with the plot. In the day of the DVD movie length should not be such a big concern. I say make longer movies if it means better explaining such rich and detailed books like Queen of the Damned or The Vampire Lestat. The set production was nice and lavish and the soundtrack was very appropriate and perfectly projected Lestat's rock star image from the novel. As for the performances I thought Townsend did a very good job at portraying the Lestat I read about in the second novel. He produced the perfect amount of bravado that Lestat is known for and it's clear that Stuart did his homework and took the role very seriously. As for Aaliyah's performance I thought it was very good despite a very poor script. She perfectly displayed Akasha's evil and sensuality with perfection. It's a shame that this was her last movie. One performance that was over emphasized was Natalie Moreau's performance as Jesse. Moreau played the part well but Jesse is given far more importance as a character in this movie and I honestly felt that the romance between her and Lestat was very cheesy and typical Hollywood B grade rubbish. Vincent Perez was hardly the Marius that I envisioned but he played the part well and I was surprisingly satisfied with his performance. Overall, I really feel that this movie has its moments and is fun to watch but is plagued by a poor script. They really should have made separate movies instead of combining both books. The movie could have easily been called the Vampire Lestat since his character is the dominant story when in reality Akasha should have been just as strong a presence in this movie. It's clear that this movie didn't get the first class treatment that its far better predecessor received and that's a shame.",1015200000,,2638,4.6875
1735001,2,B000069I5V,"As a dedictaed Anne Rice fan, I was determined to see the movie regardless of critics for or against.  I was at a loss for words as I witnessed the pages of her novel seemingly burned by the second as the film progressed.  Had I not read the books, I might have enjoyed the movie.  Although a lackluster plot and actor performances, it still had entertainment value.  A definite ""MTV"" vibe but that's where the movie is marketed to.  After reading review after review, I was saddned by the self-proclaimed ""die hard"" Rice fans who hailed the movie as following very closely to the orginal story.  I think they have forgotten that lestat was not made by marius - thus his whole ""I'll give you the choice I never had"" tagline.  David Talbot was obsessed with Marius?  Maharet kills Akasha and becomes a statue?  Akasha doesn't want to kill male children so she can have a society of women? etc..etc..etc..  Now that I have raved over the masacre of the story, let me review the movie honestly - Aaliyah is given much praise because it is her last movie, but her performance is minimal and without any real command.  Make-up is spectacular but special effects are overall weak with a few cool spots but nothing that wows the audience.  Stuart Townsend is the definite plus to this film.  Stuart who? was the question months before but he commanded a role that was forshadowed by the likes of the great one. He did a fine job of portraying the devilishly toublesome Lestat as depicted by Rice.  Although rated R, the film is definitely geared to teenagers (as are most rated R movies) and one should expect the MTV amosphere based on the movie and the original story itself. Slow in the beginning, but quick to pick up.  Middle to end keeps your attention and paces nicely.  Worth paying ticket price one time for the fun value.  Don't go expecting a deep, meaningful film with dramatic performances and you'll be entertained just fine.",1015200000,6,1932,4.618768328445748

1735003,2,B000069I5V,"Okay, I'm sure that the plot of the movie is already up in this page, so I'll skip that and get right to the point.
First off, this movie is a mix of the two Anne Rice books: The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned.
The first half an hour was boring as hell. Sure, it had good moments here and there,  but it just didn't seem to go anywhere.  And then when Akasha, the title character, FINALLY appeared, it started looking good....for about five minutes.  It seemed like the film makers were struggling to make it look good, which is a real shame because they have so much potential with this.  But the movie just seemed to drag.  And then, when there was action, it was just thrown away.  It was too short. The only good thing was the music.
Another beef with this movie was the SCARCITY OF THE TITLE CHARACTER!! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT???She was probably in about 15 minutes total of the movie.  And I know for a fact that Aaliyah was alive for the whole run of the film, rest her sole. That is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1. Aaliyah's acting was really good.  It is a real shame.
My last beef with this movie is that you really don't know who to root for. Essentially, there is no good guy.  Even the supposed good guys are still blood sucking demons.
All in all, this movie was a real let down.  I'm sure vamp fans and goths will love this flick, but it was too disappointing for me, and I love vampires.",1015113600,3,1420,4.168498168498169
1735004,3,B000069I5V,"I think people went into this movie thinking that they would hate it.  Especially some fans.  I'm an Anne Rice fan and I'll say this:  it doesn't follow the book completely, but I liked it quite a bit.
To sum it up, Queen of the Damned is actually made up of the second and third books of the Vampire Chronicals consisting of chunks from both Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat.  It may be called Queen of the Damned, and the posters focus on Akasha, but it really is about Lestat (which is what Queen was about anyway.)
I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie, but went into it with an open mind.  I liked Interview, but didn't care for the choice of Tom (over the top) Cruise as Lestat.  The choice of Stewart Townsend was WELL casted as he slithers about reeking of sexuality, just like Lestat; too bad he wasn't the original choice for Interview.
In terms of the storyline, to incorporate or base a movie on both books is a difficult task that can fail and unfortunately, it did in some areas.  From reading the negative reviews about QOTD, too much was incorporated into the storyline without explaining the background of each (i.e., Akasha is the first of the vampire bloodline and when her life ceases to exist, so do all the vampires created beneath her.)  Stuff like this is never explained and anyone who has never read the books can understandably be confused.
I was more excited by seeing the characters I became so familiar with come to life, but we are only focusing on specific characters in this flick.  Namely, Akasha, Marius, Lestat, Jesse and Maharet.  All the others are present, but most of them don't even have a single line.  Vampires such as Mael, Armand and Pandora are present, but have such a small screen presence that it is disappointing considering they had larger roles in the books.  Also, the movie is heavily edited.  In the beginning, when Lestat comes across the band ""Satan's Night Out"" the shots go immediately from ""You're a Vampire? LOL!"" to ""Are you going to kill us?""  Obviously there was a chunk of conversation cut out from them to laugh at him and then be frightened of him -- it's illogical.  These are probably going to be on the DVD later.  Methinks they should have obviously done two movies and both books, but the ""need"" for bang-em-up scenes led to skipping the second book and doing the third.  Somewhat disappointing there as I feel the storyline suffered.
The storyline is choppy, but the visuals are just stunning.  We're not talking Matrix-like effects of jumping and such, but imagery, setting the tone of the movie, sets and glowing eyes... I really felt like I was seeing the world of vampires through theirs.  It reminded me of a really good Goth video and I found myself really pulled in.  On another note, if you're into heavier Korn-type music you will definitely get a blast out of the soundtrack.
All in all, I was really pleased with this.  I went into this movie knowing that to capture the whole storyline would be impossible and understanding that artistic licenses would be taken.  With that in mind, any fan with this attitude would enjoy this movie for the creation it's become.  Give it a shot -- you might be surprised how much you like it.",1015113600,54,3231,4.561525129982669

If you HAVE read the books, you will be utterly OFFENDED and APPALLED at the blatent disregard for everthing Anne Rice wrote. The ONLY saving graces were the music, the queens costumes, and the stunning portrayal of Marius by Vincent Perez. Aaliyah's one and only good scene was her taking out the ""Adrmirals Arm's"" - which was perhaps THE MOVIES only good scene. Stuart Townsend i'm afraid confused the roll of Lestat with the roll of THE CROW. Or was this atrocity perhaps the fault of the director? ""NO NO NO!!! POSE MORE!!! TILT YOUR HEAD DOWN AND STARE THROUGH THAT BROWN SMUDGE AROUND YOUR EYES THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE! YEAH! THAT'S IT! THAT'S GOOD ACTING!!"" And yes this is minor, but who exactly was it who decided EVERYONE'S hair color had to be made the exact OPPOSITE from how it was written! ...

Third of all...Jesse wrote to her aunt Maharet, and was seriously injured at Lestat's concert from which she was brought to a hospital and taken by Maharet to her place where Maharet made her immortal. And Akasha's goal was to kill 98% of men to make the world a BETTER place, not HELL...even if it would cause chaos. Maharet also had a twin sister named Mekare for which was searching to kill Akasha for all the pain put on her. In the ending,Mekare and Maharet EAT Akasha's brain and heart...for which they become the strongest of them. Talk about way off....but the movie still deserves 5 stars.

The entire part about the twins was cut out.  Louie was never mentioned.  Marius makes Lestat in the movie and in the movie Marius is an evil monster.  If you read the book you know Lestat was made by Magnus.  In the movie Lestat and Marius go out and kill two gypsies without a reason and then Lestat writes a song about it 200 years later.  Akasha didn't want to give the earth to women like she did in the book.  She just wanted to drink a glut of blood.  Oh yeah, that was just the first twenty minutes.  The worst part for me was when Lestat made Jesse a vampire so he could spend eternity with her.  Oh my god.  In the book he may have only spoken with her once.  And Maheret made her a vampire.  Mekare isn't even in this.  And you don't know that Khaymen, Pandora and Armand were until the credits.
Bottom line:  If you read the book and enjoyed it, don't watch the movie.  it will just leave you feeling really, really angery.",1015027200,,1141,4.175115207373272
1735008,4,B000069I5V,"I went into this movie wondering how Warner Bros could top a film like Interview With The Vampire with its huge budget and stellar cast of buffo boyz (Cruise, Pitt and Banderas).  Clever Bros didn't try to they went another way all together.  Did it work?  For me it did.
I am an Anne Rice fan but I went into the movie knowing that the collosal story of Lestat, the ancient vampires, especially Those Who Must Be Kept could never be told in less than 2 hours.  Let me just say that it wasn't.  They chose to zoom in on Lestat coming out into the open as a rock star, in a goth band called The Vampire Lestat.  The film adds a romance with Jesse (great grandchild of the ancient vampiress Maharet) which could have been left out, but for those people unfamiliar with the whole story it probably provided a touchstone.  It keeps the nasty, almost unstoppable villiness in the form of the mother vampire from ancient Egypt, Akasha (the late R&B singer Aaliyah).  While she is not on the screen very long her scenes are titillating and enjoyable to watch.  Marius, played admirably by Swiss born actor, Vincent Perez, is the historian, painter and caretaker of the sleeping Akasha.  In this movie version he is also Lestat's maker (in the book it was Magnus).  He is relegated to the station of amused and horrified parent as Lestat disregards his advice to live on the edge of human society in the shadows as immortals have done for centuries and watches bemused as Lestat becomes a household name and a vision on MTV and stages throughout the world. ...
There is no doubt that with another 20 to 30 minutes of film, this could have been the best vampire picture ever made. It would have helped immensely to introduce each of the old vampires: Khayman (the one in rags), Pandora (Indian), Mael (prehistoric looking dude), Armand (pudgy, long haired strawberry blonde). Stuart Townsend's performance as Lestat reminds me very much of Brandon Lee's in The Crow.  He is bold, bratty, sensual, funny and oh so easy on the eyes.  I didn't miss the blonde hair and gray eyes of the book character at all.  He caught the essence of Lestat and ran with it.  For me Lestat, Marius and Akasha made this film so enjoyable.
The film has a hard, edgy and sometimes flashy look to it so different from the the warm, elegance of Interview With the Vampire, but it does reflect its time adequately.  Art Direction and Special Effects were as good as can be expected on a lower budget film.  I particularly liked the eyes of the vampires glinting as they immerged from darkness, like an owl or a cat's eyes suddenly caught in the lights of a car.
Take a bite and try it.  Let the vampire Lestat tempt and dare you, but don't think anything bad while watching the film.  Lestat loves the movies and you never know who might be sitting in the dark with you.

The only reason I gave the movie 2 stars was because she was in it.  She was a good actress and I give her props for the way she portrayed her character.

  They kept the main plot intact and, with only a few minor changes, were able to fluidly portray the emotional rollercoaster that this story is.  Since the novels are divided into so  many diverse sub-plots, I can understand why they had to choose the main plot over all of the mini plots.  It did leave a few holes without Akasha's backstory and the twins, but when compared to many other page to screen adaptations, this one stays true 98% of the time,
  I was least impressed with Stuart Townsend as Lestat.  I wish they had found an actor with more experience to portray such a deep character, but he pulled it off well enough for the film.  Lena Olin was fabulous as Maharet and was exactly as I pictured the character being.  I would have preferred a bit more explaining and screen time of the ancients, but we can't have it all.  The prize of the film was the late Aaliyah as Queen Akasha.  For as little acting experience as she had, she portrayed the Queen with a ferocity and beauty that astounded me.  This is definately a role worth remembering her for.  Her screen time was relatively short, but she still carried the movie.
  Overall, with good special effects, good acting, and a fairly true-to-the-books story, I would have to say Queen of the Damned was a fabulous film and nice follow up to Interview with the Vampire.",1014854400,4,1554,4.450354609929078

I thought it was interesting that Lestat could be a superstar and be open about being a bloodsucker, and nobody really cares. In fact, I thought the movie was awesome right up to the Queen of The Damned herself entered into it. No offense to Aaliyah, God bless, she was wonderful, she played the character very well (all thirty minutes of the movie she was in anyways). But the movie took this weird turn where they tried to cram tons of stuff into 45 minutes. It's almost like they had to shorten just the last hour of the movie.

But don't let anyone make you change your mind because of a review see it yourself and then you make your mind up, even if its not exacily what you think it should be its your opinion no one elses, make your mid up for yourself.
On a lighter note as a fan of Anne Rice and all her Books from the Vampire Chronicales to the Mayfair Witches to the sleeping beauty series and many more Queen of the Damned will Never be a disapointment to me I loved the way Lestat was played, when i first saw who Stuart Townsend was i never thought he would be able to potray Lestat as who he was, but I was wrong and think he did a beautiful job as well as everyone else, except for one person Paul McGann did not fit the image of David Talbot but he did with his attitude and manner of how he conducted himself.

1735026,2,B000069I5V,"""Queen of the Damned,"" the latest in a long, long, long line of vampires-gone-amok movies, contains elements borrowed from various different films, all of which are easily spotted, and none of which are the least bit interesting, or fun. From special effects that look like left-over CGI work from ""The Matrix,"" to the hard rock and heavy metal music that permeates much of today's horror fare, this ""Queen"" is a royal pain.
The story is based on the novel from Anne Rice, who penned the now-famous ""Interview With the Vampire,"" which was also made into a motion picture. ""Queen,"" being the third in a series of four books, begins with the introduction of Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has awakened from a deep sleep to resume his machinations on Earth. After converting a hard rock band into his personal entourage, he makes himself known publicly to the world, summoning his fellow vampires to join him in his openness.
But does everyone buy into it? Or does the whole world, save for a handful of mortal characters, look at is as a publicity stunt? Once his presence has been announced, and his fame sealed, Lestat soon finds himself the subject of fascination by Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a young woman affiliated with a London-based association that studies the dealings of the underworld without dabbling in it themselves. Of course, being youthful and stupid, Jesse becomes entranced by Lestat after reading his journal, which reveals his inner torments and his love for Akasha (Aaliyah), known by vampires as ""the queen of all who are damned.""
If you're wondering where all of this is going, then you're probably not going to get much satisfaction from the film itself. The movie finds a comfort zone in the reminiscence of Lestat's past as read by Jesse, and for a few, fleeting moments, the movie looks as though it will take off. But then we are cast back into the less-entertaining subplots, as Jesse pleads with him to make her immortal, while Akasha, returning in (literally) a blaze of glory, seeks him out to make him her new king.
Putting the movie's faithfulness to the book aside, the story presented here is just plain messy, jumping to and fro between past and present, setting and setting, with little attention to its characters' emotions or to coherence. I must give the movie credit for attempting to evoke sympathy for Lestat, but why does he feel burdened by immortality, when the film itself is constantly reverting to its pro-vampire appeal? And where's the fear factor? What's so scary about Akasha, who points at things and causes them to combust?
You do have to give director Michael Rymer credit for at least trying to put a stylish spin on the film. ""Queen"" has all the dismal glitz and gothic radiance money can buy, but it's all been done before, and much better. The fancy choreography of action and fight sequences can be attributed to the recent rage in such fanciful tactics spun from movies like ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" The film's overall edge, from the music to the quick cuts, is reminiscent of the far-superior ""Blade,"" and since when does a movie have to make your ears bleed to be interesting?
The casting also turns out to be one of the film's pitfalls. Since much of the movie is guided by narration on the part of Lestat and Jesse, cast members Townsend and Moreau provide voice-overs that, oddly enough, are devoid of any suspense or intensity. Their performances onscreen are credible enough, though Townsend is no Bela Lugosi, or even Gary Oldman; for vampire, he doesn't carry the presence needed to evoke chills. As for the now-deceased Aaliyah, it's hard to say: the movie provides her with little dialogue, and she is onscreen for maybe a total of fifteen minutes, barely enough time to make any decision as to her talent.
While I was watching ""Queen of the Damned,"" my mind was elsewhere, thinking about far better vampire-oriented films like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" or ""Blade,"" and even ""Dracula 2000,"" which is similar in its stylistic intent to this film. I have yet to read a page of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles;"" after seeing the film, it's not on the top of my list, either. The film lacks intensity, energy, suspense, and originality; in short, it's about as lively as the blood that flows through Akasha's veins.",1014681600,7,4310,4.841463414634147

Part of that was due to the amazing soundtrack, but most was the fact that the movie just ruled!  Stuart Townsend did an incredible job of portraying Lestat, the egotistical, irresistible vampire who awakens Akasha, Queen of the Damned. Aaliyah did an equally impressive job in her part of Akasha, but I was disappointed that her part was so brief.  The set was amazing and I can only imagine how much time and money it cost.

Vincent Perez is the best actor in this film--you could tell that he had a lot of fun playing ""Marius.""  Unfortunatly, he was not in enough scenes in this movie, but in every scene in he does appear in, he ""steals the show.""
Stuart Townsend did an okay-job of playing ""Lestat.""  Dare I say it?  Yes, Tom Cruise (eek!!!) did do a better job.  However, Mr. Townsend did nail the whole ""rock star"" image.
Aaliyah was simply magnificent--from everything that I have read concerning her, she was a wonderful, sweet person.  Playing the very evil Queen, she proved that she could act.  Such a shame that this will be her only movie, due to her untimely death.
All in all, it was a good movie--worth the price of the ticket, and yes, when it comes out on DVD I will be buying it.",1014681600,,1041,4.367875647668394

They didn't even show how the Queen was made. That was the best part of the book. They cut so much out. I was expecting to get to meet the other vampires, they never mentioned them just showed them briefly at the end. And the end wasn't even close as it was in the book.

1735030,3,B000069I5V,"Very different from Interview, which is both good and bad. Good because it wasn't so sad and slow, and bad because it lacked some of Interview's substance. Townsend makes a wonderful Lestat, even if his hair was too dark. Don't get me wrong, I loved Cruise, but when he played Lestat, it was like Lestat was playing Tom Cruise, if that makes any sense. Townsend is terribly sexy, both scary and sympathetic. Altho most of the characters were a lot more two dimensional than I would have liked, I thought all were cast well, with the obvious exception of Marius. No offense to the actor, but he looked nothing like the Marius from the book. I didn't mind the slight rewrites of Rice's story. Fair warning to Orthodox Chronicle fans... they take some liberties with the film. The music, of course, was the spine of the movie, and it fit perfectly. I'm not so into goth rock, but some of the songs are irresistable, even to a showtune lovin' girl such as myself. Would've liked to see more characterization with the major vampires... learning all their names wouldn't have hurt at least. But they at least looked the part. Armand... much better cast this time. Also DiCaprio looking. Perfect. But like others, I missed Mekare and Gabrielle. If they were going to bring in parts of TVL, I also would've preferred seeing Nicolas. My last criticism is the killing of Akasha scene seemed too early in the film. Ten more minutes of plot couldn't have hurt that bad since the movie was less than two hours as it is. All in all, a good film, well acted. Will definately see it again just for the experience alone.

After viewing the movie I was dissapointed to say the least. Stuart Townsend has very little presence to me and is not worthy of sharing the screen with the late great Aaliyah. First, you must wait a least an hour before you actually see Aaliyah act...but when she finally arrives, her entrance is grand. This scene may take your breath away, although not for the reason the director intended,in the case of this scene the parallels between art and life are too close for comfort. Immediately after viewing the movie I walked the mall for almost and hour, thinking how distasteful (if that's a word) it was for the producers of this movie to allow it on the big screen, especially so soon after the passing of this earth angel. Aaliyah did play her part well however, the few lines she was given, she owned, but there's a downside to this as well. The overdubbed vocals combined with the thick accent she had to master make it difficult to understand her words at times. But, If you are a fan of Aaliyah's , you will not be dissapointed in her performance. However, if you are just a movie fan, you may want to head for John Q.",1014595200,2,1248,4.449781659388647

""...Oh, so there's this queen and she is a vampire and like evil and stuff... someone dies... There's a concert, like in.. Let's say death valley...""
If the book were a person and had gone on a drinking binge coupled with a heavy drug addiction and the one moment of clarity is Lestat's character, it would become the movie.  There are times when I was guessing as to who the other vampires were, I don't know how you could understand what was going on unless you read the book, and if you did read the book you will be obsessing as to Marius & Lestat's haircolor.
There are only two reasons to see it; Stuart Townsend, he did an excellent job as Lestat, and the preview for ""eight legged freaks"" which seems like an oscar contendor... (yeah right)",1014595200,2,1040,4.439790575916231

I saw the previews, which were cool beyond belief! The scenes of the Queen had me half out of my seat every time I saw them!
That being said, I was a little scared that Lestat didn't have blond hair, but I thought ""hey, who cares, it's still going to be great!"" Then in the theater, opening night, the first scene, my heart sank....first there was BAD ACTING... then came the BAD ADAPTATION... which tied in the BAD SCRIPT... and the BAD DIALOGUE.... and led to a just plain BAD MOVIE. When I say BAD, I mean HORRIBLE. This movie did no justice to the books, it did no justice to even a good storyline.
If you like the books, save your money. If you like a good vampire flick, one that makes sense, save your money. If you like to watch a movie and leave the place in a good mood, save your money. But, if you like to be confused, upset, or just plain disgusted after two hours of squirming in your seat, this one's for you!
Don't get me wrong, I loved to see Aaliyah in her final role. Her portrayal as the Queen was excellent. It was just not enough to carry the rest of the movie.
I'll end by saying that I understand the excitement of the reviewers who had not yet seen the movie, since I felt the same only two days ago.

Magnus did not explain the ways of the vampire to Lestat when he made him, and it explains why Lestat is the way he is. But in the movie, Marius explained everything to Lestat(!). It makes no sense as in the movie ""Interview with the Vampire"" Lestat said to Louis that he would teach him ""everything that I never knew"".  I also found that the focus on the rock concert was a little too much. They could have used that time in the movie a little better. Basically, they condensed two books into one for the movie, and left out a lot of important parts and characters of the story in the process. Really, they should have made two movies to cover the two books ""The Vampire Lestat"" and ""The Queen of the Damned"". There was enough storyline in each to provide interest for a movie goer.

Then I remembered this is based on an Ann Rice story, and last year, I read over 2000 pages of her novels-- the Witching Hour series. And I began to look forward to more than just a dumb monster, but rather, a fleshed out collection of characters.
I wasn't disappointed. The movie delivers some great characters as well as stunning visuals and the sound... well the sound stays with you long after you leave. Aaliyah is extraordinary, mesmerizing as a queen of the vampires should be. And her voice is haunting and beyond  words.
When it comes down to it, this movie is a rock and roll vampire movie. Or, to be more precise, a goth-metal vampire movie.
As an Ann Rice reader, it was fun to get a look inside the world of the talamasqua-- the secret society which has been tracking the comings and goings of the paranormal beings of this planet for 1400 years.

There are several charming moments, as well, some good lines, some touching interactions, some nice special effects. . . and here comes the ""but.""
Queen of the Damned is neither fish nor fowl.  It varies too much from the books (oftentimes in enraging ways) too serve as a movie adaptation, and yet it requires you to have read them in order to understand what's going on.  There is no explanation of the Talamasca, you never learn why Maharet opposes Akasha, it's never explained who all these people are that suddenly show up at the end of the movie:  all of this requires having read the novels, but if you have read them. . . oh, how you cringe.
All of the casting was horribly off type.  No one looked as they should.  Even if you can forgive that, the relationships and personalities were sickeningly warped.  Marius as Lestat's maker?  And speaking of Lestat, what happened to his sense of playfulness?  Aside from a singular ""Boo,"" he was so dark and brooding.  I'm looking for the Tom Cruise Lestat that danced with a corpse, not the self-important Marilyn Manson clone of Townsend.
One other thing:  what was with the horrible makeup jobs?  There was nothing to distinguish a vampire from a human except for the occasional special effects flash of the eyes.  Oh, and a lot of really dark eyeshadow.
So many of the details that make a movie were missing from this.  It had the potential to be something great, but it was just lost somewhere in the process.

The scenes when Lestat is singing the music of Korn provide the rest. Outside of this, the movie was disappointing, and overall failed to capture the drama of Anne Rices story. The movie moves all too quickly through the plot and does very little to develop any of the characters. There is a very pop-culture feel to this movie, much like that of the crow or many more of the B grade vampire movies around. I must admit I was hoping for more on that score.
As for inconsistencies with the book. Well there are a lot of them. Marius is hardly the same character. No brooding in his art or no mention of only killing the evil doer. Not to mention, the movie describes him as the maker of Lestat. (Why?) How hard can it be to tell the truth? There is no mention of Maharet's sister, Mekare; Nothing of Pandora. The final scene is completely inconsistent with the book.
Still. I am glad I saw the movie and it was still worth watching (as a Anne Rice fan).",1014508800,10,1073,4.316831683168317
1735053,2,B000069I5V,"If not for the fact that this movie was based on Ann Rice's book, then it might be decent, but instead hollywood has screwed up another one. This movie is in no way connected to the first one except by the name Lestat. And Lestat does not act at all like he should. The Tom Cruise's Lestat was much more likable and was the complete opposite of this Lestat. In the first movie, Lestat said that he and the one who made him were from Paris. The book said the same. Not in this movie. In this movie they are both from Egypt. I'm not one of those people who thinks that the movie should be the exact same thing as the book. But if your writing's a sequal at least stick somewhat close to the facts presented in the first movie. And maybe it wouldn't hurt to have something in the movie be like the book. It's as if the people who made this movie said lets have the characters act completely different from the ones in the book. This movie's look is very good but it lacks anything remotely close to a story. There are a lot of gaps in this movie. This did not even come remotely close to interview with the vampire.",1014508800,4,1112,4.152777777777778
1735054,3,B000069I5V,"My husband and I went to see this the day it was released. The movie was pretty good. It was nice to see Lestat portrayed with a little more heart than in ""Interview with a Vampire"". I will say ""Interview"" was much better. There were some things in the movie that didn't quite jive with the books, or with the first movie. Lestat stated in the first movie he never knew his maker, but in ""Queen"" it shows a flashback of him being made. I loved the concept though, the actors were wonderful, Aaliyah was awesome in the part she played. I think it could have been a little more profound, and a little more detailed. I did like the ending though, I thought it was very touching. The music is great and I think Stuart Townsend did a fantastic job as Lestat. I almost think I liked him better than Tom Cruise. I have this whole series of books and have read the first two. Now, I am planning to finish it just because I want to know EVERYTHING about that part of Lestats ""life"" as you may call it. Its a great flick if you are really into just vampire movies, you won't be disappointed. But if you have seen ""Interview"" and read the books, you will find it is missing a little bit in detail. I think they should have told a little more of the story of Akasha and a little less of Lestat. Even so, I will end up buying it once it is released to VHS, just to add it to my vampire collction of movies, and in honor of Aaliyah.",1014508800,,1418,4.122743682310469
1735055,4,B000069I5V,"I thought the movie was great!  But I didn't get the same feeling about the characters that I did in the books.  I was kind of under the suspicion Lestat and most of the other Vampires were kinda gay, but in this movie they are strictly hetrosexual.  So in that way only I think it differed from the book enough to make it Hollywood; Peter Townsend did a great portrayal of Lestat.  Maybe making the Vampires gay-like (like the books) would have turned people off to this movie.",1014508800,,478,4.3977272727272725
1735056,5,B000069I5V,"I was a little apprehensive about going to see this movie. Feeling that the wonderful talents of Stuart Townsand and former R&B singer Aaliyah couldn't possibly pull off such a dark and mysterious acting roll as that in Ann Rice's novel, but what a brilliant performance. This movie literally left me feeling all tingly inside. The acting was wonderfully superb! I recommend this movie to any Vampire buff!!! This will definitely be rated as a #1 film of 2002! And let me assure you that the soundtrack is just as awesome as the movie!",1014422400,,535,4.702127659574468
1735057,4,B000069I5V,"I'd read that if you take everything you know about Queen as a book and just chuck all that then it would be an enjoyable movie and i think that holds true.. It was a visually stunning movie with a whole gothic vampire culture vibe to it that was absolutely taking. Jesse was awesome, as was Stuart as Lestat and all the other characters.. I liked Aaliyah a great deal she played Akasha as written in the novel.. It kept from the book its mystical power and eroticism... Sets were awesome exactly as i had imagined. Stuart was so much more than i expected and very much better than a prior actor as Lestat. He had the whole sex appeal thing going that made me wish once again to be chosen as a eternal companion for Lestat. I so wish they wouldnt had wound it up so fast when they took such pains to explain everything so well in the beginning, and they really needed to at least call the vampires by name who were with Maharet but basically as a long time Anne Rice fan I wish to see it again and again.",1014422400,4,1004,4.180412371134021
1735058,4,B000069I5V,"I love Aaliyah and everything she's ever done. In this movie,she really demonstrates that women reign supreme and do have the power to be in control. I was disappointed that she wasn't in more scenes though. I feel that the movie was lacking something--I don't know what, but something. Overall, it could have been better.",1014422400,,322,4.872727272727273
1735059,5,B000069I5V,"I went to this movie expecting something really cool, something good, even if it didn't have the original actors, it had to be pretty good....and when the credits started to roll, and the lights came on...I just looked at my friend and said ""now that totally ROCKED!"" It went far beyond me thinking it would be good. the Portrayal of the characters was so much more well done. They actually looked and acted as I thought they should. Interview was definatly an amazing movie, don't get me wrong...but this movie just captures how these characters are supposed to be. Yes there are some changes to the story, but isn't there with any book to movie? Awesome movie! I hope they make more from the series in the futures!",1014336000,,716,4.6015625
1735060,2,B000069I5V,"It seems like a natural progression for the vampire Lestat to go public and become a rock star in Michael Rymer's ""Queen of the Damned.""  After all, he is charismatic, handsome, sinewy of body, quick of mind, clarion of voice as portrayed by Stuart Townsend late of ""About Adam"" and Dublin, Ireland.
But why did the producers decide to over dub Townsend's voice with one that has a definite Transylvanian twang when Lestat is/was a Frenchman?  And why use Aaliyah so little in what amounts to basically a cameo as the mother vampire of all vampires, Akasha?
While ""resting"" in his coffin for a hundred years or so, Lestat decides it's time to get back among the living and make his mark once again...this time as a rock singer : kind of a combination Jim Morrison and Lita Ford.(He says""I've hidden in the shadows for centuries. It's time for a change."") He fondly recalls his time spent with Marius (a dissapated Vincent Perez..the vampire who ""outs"" him)and his knack for playing the violin.  But instead of becoming the next Heifetz he choses to become Marilyn Manson.
But as luck would have it, Lestat gains riches and celebrity, a groovy pad in the Hollywood Hills and as many nubile young blood donors as he can handle...but he still longs for Love and an eternal mate. He thinks maybe it will be Akasha....but is it?
Michael Rymer's pacing of ""Queen of the Damned"" is deadly: sluggish and at times amateurish which is a pity as his cast is first rate and the basic idea of the film is interesting. Rymer has turned the Anne Rice source material into a soap opera and not a good one at that.
""Interview with the Vampire,"" with Tom Cruise as Lestat was not a success but ""Queen of the Damned"" makes it look like a masterwork by comparison. It's obvious that much money was spent on the decor of the movie...more should have been spent on giving the film an all encompassing style and point of view.
And what of the ""Talamascans""? An organization whose motto is to ""Observe the dark realm but be not of it?"" As presented here they are a bad copy of ""Buffy the Vampire Killer's"" entourage.
This kind of material needs a strong, innovative director/writer and Rymer is simply not up to the task. Where is Roman Polanski when we need him?",1014336000,3,2239,4.5785536159601
1735061,3,B000069I5V,"Well, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is finally out in theatres. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie. QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is based on the book by the same name -- which was written by Ann Rice. QUEEN OF THE DAMED stars Stuart Townsend as Lestat and the late Aaliyah as Akasha. The movie as a whole was pretty average. Aaliayh's performance was excellent as Akasha. She was yet scary and evil. She portrayed the character very well. QUEEN OF THE DAMNED swirls around Lestat's life.. rockstar and all. Akasha comes in about half way through. That was another thing... I thought Aaliyah was gonna be in the entire movie but whatever -- it was still a great performance. QUEEN OF THE DAMED wasn't as deep as INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE but it's still worth checking out.",1014336000,2,765,4.510791366906475

I have read almost every book Anne Rice has written in the ""Chronicles"", and ""Queen of the Damned"" was definitely the best. I have waited on this movie ever since they started producing it. I also read on the net that Anne Rice had very little to do, if anything with the production of this movie, unlike ""Interview"". So, as a warning to all of the die-hard fans out there, be prepared for a possible let down. I've read part of the supposed ""script"" off of a web page & it focused too much on Lestat's band.

At least I didn't plop down $20 for the blu-ray.  Boring and predictable with a lot of crappy music thrown in would best describe this mess.  The acting was 2nd rate and couldn't hold a match to the far superior ""Interview With A Vampire.""  It was, however, nice to see 8th Doctor Paul McGann as David and Bruce ""Gyro Captain"" Spence as a background vampire.  The late Aaliyah was completely unconvincing as the ancient progenitor vampire and Townsend was a poor substitute for Tom Cruise, and I'm not a Cruise fan.

7965669,4,B000069I5V,"I think as a story it was not so bad. As a representation of a book, the other reviewers suggest it did a poor job. Perhaps trying to fit a book or two into a movie script is what makes for a disappointing movie.
The acting was pretty good. Aaliyah had a good cognizance of her body, and did a good job dancing through it all. Her diction was well done too, for a singer. Stuart Townsend seemed a little coquette-ish for my taste. He was trying to translate 'irresistible' and it turned into something cheesy. Also, portraying the singing rock star, he seemed oddly reserved. I think he was trying to not look ridiculous and tempering his body accordingly. If he'd watched some NIN or Korn videos or concerts he might have loosened his physical restraint during his performance a little. I mean, if he'd been singing he might have had to throw himself into it more.
The make up was quite good in most cases, especially for Akasha. The vampire design was pretty much oddly accentuated eye shadow, so not as great. The statuary could have been better.
Basically I was here for the music. Jonathan Davis' singing voice didn't quite match Townsend's speaking voice, but it would have been tricky to cast an actor to fit the way he sang.",1521158400,,1232,4.5291479820627805
