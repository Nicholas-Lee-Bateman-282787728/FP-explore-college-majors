4979529,4,B0069556PO,"I loved this show more than most people would. To me it was not only a brilliant piece of the shoujo genre but a bench mark of anime in general. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for something a little different to what their used to watching. On that note however, I must say that i'm very disappointed with this box set. The art work on the box itself is very stylish and actually quite impressive. Unfortunately, some idiot at Funimation decided it was a good idea to put the series synopsis and disc content on a sticker covering the back side of the box art work and then combined that with the plastic wrapping. No amount of careful removal was enough to ensure the box stayed perfectly intact and now the very beautiful artwork on the boxset is torn and ruined. Although it is a relatively small issue it's still sad that one of my favorite series is now a damaged piece of my collection and any replacements i may order will be the same.",1330300800,,960,4.398876404494382

4979531,5,B0069556PO,"Review by my daughter:

I live by the thought that every girl is a princess. So right off I loved it. I also am a ""social outcast"" and I freakout when I see really pretty girls or guys. (Also, like Mayaya-san, I'm a Three Kingdoms fan since I was very little.) The Sisterhood is a very likeable and quirky group that you can't help but cheer for! Kuronosuke is a great male lead and when he puts on his bra and wig it's like he has super powers! I adore him to death! All in all I would call this a great, heart-warming, feel-good anime. I've just started watching it but I can't wait to buy since it makes me feel so good and glad to be ME every episode!
Kyaa~! I'm going to start squee'ing and gushing now, so taa-taa all you darlings!",1328659200,22,737,4.118055555555555

4979533,5,B0069556PO,"I watched this a while back and was amazed. I'd never heard of it before then but it was probably the cutest anime I'd seen. It made me laugh a lot and the characters are all really amazing. It's worth spending the money to buy as you can rewatch it- I already have it preordered. I'm not sure how the english dub will sound, as I've only watched it with subtitles. But for anyone wondering if they want to buy it: You won't regret it. It's cute, funny, and it'll make you feel good. c:",1324944000,5,486,4.126315789473685

The casing, the art box that the dvds and blurays come in are great, and the Japanese dubbing is great. The only problem I have with this is the English dub. It's a little odd and uneven, I felt. Everyone I showed this anime to loved it, even my husband! Now they just need to publish the manga in English.",1322956800,11,521,4.019230769230769

4979544,4,B0069556PO,"Princess Jellyfish is an enjoyable yet short anime that follows the daily lives of a group of nerdy, geeky women (Dubbed the Sisterhood) who live in the same apartment complex. Their lives get turned upside down when one member of the sisterhood befriends a charismatic male crossdresser who then decides to visit her complex.

I would recommend this anime to anyone that enjoys whacky comedy as well as some romantic moments. The characters are all unique and have their own identity, be it loud and boisterous to quiet and timid. Princess Jellyfish is a very unique show and my summarization doesn't give the show justice. The animation is great, the characters are interesting, the general plot is good and the show has a very fun atmosphere. The only real issue I have with the show is that it leaves things very open ended. Like Berserk, one would have to pick up the manga to continue the story. That aside, I highly recommend this anime.",1485561600,2,944,4.7560975609756095

The manga goes much much further, so if you were left wondering at the abrupt ending, you may want to look at the manga. Until the abrupt ending, it was pretty much spot on from the manga. The art is cute, and the voice talents were good, unlike some animes where I'm left wondering why they would butcher a great character with a funky voice talent.",1483056000,4,427,4.156626506024097

It's a fairly quiet romance anime with themes of becoming an independent adult, loss of a parent, breaking out of your comfort zone, and friendships.

This is a Josei manga which means it is targeted for women, something that is unheard-of in the U.S. I just love awkward humor, so in that aspect this was just what I like. The ending left many unanswered questions which from what my friend who can read Japanese tells me is answered in the manga. Unfortunately the manga is as of now only available in Japanese, Italian and French so you cannot read it unless you can read one of those languages. I loved the characters, each one was great and hilarious in his/her own way.

Although it is very funny, I wouldn't write this off as just a goofy comedy for teenage girls, it touches on economic and political realities that are familiar and relatable for my generation (one that came of age during a horrendous economic crisis) and the way it flips gender norms and the ""manic pixie dream girl"" trope on their heads is fantastic and just adds to the charm of the whole experience.

Kuranosuke is one of the most charming romantic leads I've seen in anything for a long time, dashing and pretty in equal measure.

4979627,5,B0069556PO,"One of the best comedy/romance series out there.  This is the story of a group of Otoku's who live in an apartment building and all have seprate excentricites.  I don't want to give away too much but the story, voice acting, and writing is all very very good.  My only complaint is that this is another series that really needs a sequel (badly).  While the comedy is great and the charachters are all very likeable, the romance feels unresolved at the end.  It is yet another series that gets to a happy stopping point rather than a resolution.

Still, you will like what there is here.  If you like Anime then you must see this.",1360022400,11,629,4.417391304347826

4979640,5,B0069556PO,"I read the review for Princess Jellyfish in Otaku USA and figured I would look at it. I watched it on Funimation's Youtube channel with the original Japanese voices and  English subs. I fell in love with it right off the bat. I connect with the characters and feel their fear of the fashionable types and Kuranosuka's upbeat attitude. It is funny and sweet and sometimes awkward just like all the girls in the Sisterhood. I know the series is only 11 episodes and in the last episode the producers didn't follow very close for whatever reason, but that doesn't take away from the charm. If you are super concerned you should read the manga because it is even better. The only problem is unless you can read Japanese, Italian or French you will have to use one of the online manga readers to read it. Again I personally don't mind.

4979643,4,B0069556PO,"...if not my favorite. It's a short 11-episode series, the characters are so different and lovable and the plot is absolute adorable. I would recommend it for any age (besides little kids) even though it's apparently a josei story.
Lots of cute, beautiful scenes, and the English voices are to DIE for. I absolutely love the dub- every character is perfect in my opinion.

(Possible spoiler?)

My one main complaint which I KNOW the reason for: the entire conflict is solved in the last five minutes of the series. Not only is it solved quickly; it's solved so simply that it was almost laughable. Not only that, but there never seems to be any ""main character romance"" resolution, either. Everything is left open-ended.
This is due to the manga being ongoing, I'm told. I still don't take that as an excuse xD

The good reviews on amazon made me take a chance on this anime and it's one that paid off.

Tsukihime is a nerdy girl obsessed with jellyfish struggling to make it as an illustrator in Tokyo. She lives in an all girl apartment building filled with eccentric nerd women who despise boys and avoid stylish trendy people at all costs. One evening Tsukihime's obsession with jellyfish causes her to meet Kuro, a cross dressing boy. The tale that unfolds as a result of the reluctant friendship involves a love triangle, fighting nasty corporate business and working together.

I expected a corny anime filled with stereotypical stock anime characters (and in some respects the characters are) but I found the anime to work. It was extremely fun to watch and one which merits repeat viewings.

A definite buy!",1340409600,7,1002,4.847953216374269
4979661,4,B0069556PO,"Note that the following review is based on Funimation's English Dub.

From the premise to the sub-themes, the story is definitely entertaining. Girls and women are the target audience for this series, but my two brothers found it just as entertaining as I did.

Note that if you're checking out the series because you think it'll contain homosexual sub-themes (like yaoi, BL, shonen-ai, etc), it does not. The cross-dresser's reasons for cross dressing are mostly political (or anti-political, depending on how you look at it).

Now on with the plot:

The protagonist is a geeky virgin girl named Tsukimi, (about 18 years old), who lives in a small home (Amamizukan) with other geeky women of varying ages. They all fear what Funimation dubs ""the stylish,"" which are other people (men and women alike), who are into fashion, are attractive, and/or are sociable.

A lot of people submit e-mail requests to live in Amamizukan because there is one room available, but the women must all approve and unanimously accept the applicant before the allowing someone new to break into their world and move in. The home is filled with otaku (nerds) whose interests all differ (but they all seem to be into manga or at least drawing).

Tsukimi happens to be obsessed with all of the different kinds of jellyfish and it's because of this passion that she meets a strong-willed cross-dressing ""stylish"" (named Kuranosuke) who she comes to befriend, not realizing he isn't a girl until the morning after he sleeps over at Amamizukan-- (and did I mention boys are NOT allowed in Amamizukan? Hilarious!)

From then on, the story ventures off into a few different directions from Kuranosuke trying to turn Tsukimi into a 'pretty princess' like all girls are capable of being, to his well-off political family working to demolish a lot of the homes and buildings in the area the otaku live in.
Together, the otaku and the stylish unite to speak out against these changes, and Tsukimi works her hardest to speak out against becoming a stylish.

Funimation did a pretty good job with the voices, in my opinion. (Sometimes you can't really tell unless you've watched the Japanese version so I may update my review later). Kuranosuke doesn't sound too masculine or too feminine, and the voices of all of the geeky otaku seemed pretty fitting as well. Overall, the dialogue was charming and funny in all the right places.

My only complaints about the series itself would be 1) Tsukimi's overanalyzing what little romance there is between Kuranosuke's brother and herself, and 2) the tall otaku irritates the crap out of everyone who watches the show.

Still, Tsukimi's overanalyzing can be attributed to the fact that she's a virgin who has never had a boyfriend, and the tall otaku character is perfectly otaku, so in that sense, the creators did a great job (but man is she annoying).

Because this is a romantic comedy, you would expect some romance, but what makes me like this series is the comedy that centers around the characters. In particular, the interactions between Kuranosuke and his family will make you laugh out loud (his brother Shuu seems the most against his cross-dressing whereas their uncle, (political figurehead) actually doesn't have a problem with it even though he's the one who would take the biggest hit if it got out somehow. More hilariously, their driver is an attractive and aloof young man whose obsession with Mercedes Benz rivals the passion of any of the otaku living in Amamizukan.

My favorite part of the series are when Shuu and Kuranosuke's father sends their driver to spy on Shuu. My 2nd favorite would be Kuranosuke's drive to help the girls who live in Amamizukan (even though they show little drive themselves, haha).

Even the antagonists are enjoyable (not surprising since anime has a lovely way of making you love the characters on both sides). Kuranosuke's brother Shuu has already entered the world of politics but he seems taken with Tsukimi (but only in her princess state--he doesn't even recognize her when she's not all dolled up) until Shoko (a manipulative ""vixen"") comes along and basically captures his heart.

Sadly, there are a lot of loose ends at the end of the series, like whether Shuu and Shoko get together, and you still have no idea what happened to Kuranosuke's mother. He even goes as far as trying to blackmail his own father using his brother's sadness in order to find out where she is, but even this is played off as a joke (rich families must be used to being blackmailed by each other because this doesn't seem to change their relationship at all).

Still, the loose-ended(ness of the) story leaves the viewer either itching to check out the manga to see what happens next and hoping this is just the 1st season in an ongoing series. The first thing I did after watching was searched ""Princess Jellyfish"" in Google to find out.

Aside from the romance, there are other elements of the show that specifically target women who have little to no interest in dressing fashionably. The series focuses strongly on geeky women having little to no voice whereas those girls who dress fashionably or professionally are heard and able to function more happily in society.

Despite the sub-themes regarding how every girl is capable of becoming a beautiful princess, it was interesting for me to watch Kuranosuke give the girls ""make-overs"" and then explain that even when you don't want to dress fashionably to appease society, you can look at it as ""putting on your armor"" based on the setting, in order to accomplish what you're setting out to accomplish.

This hit home with me because at work, I hardly ever dress `nice' unless I'm going to important meetings with people who are very high up, and so this is a truth I've known for a while and it was interesting to see it acknowledged in the way that it was in an anime. It's less degrading to feel like you're adhering to societal standards when you look at it from that perspective.

All in all, I would recommend this series to primarily to geeky girls like me (even though my brothers enjoyed it).",1333238400,,6104,4.823923444976076
4979662,5,B0069556PO,"I initially watched the 1st episode on Funimation's site and instantly fell in love with the series. Though it's only 11 episodes long, there is a host of fun and informative extras included, more than I've seen in a long time for an anime series on disc. One extra in particular, labeled ""field guide"", told me more than I probably needed to know, even some info that went quite a bit over my head. Still, a superb collection for any serious Kuragehime fan.",1331596800,,458,4.530120481927711
4979663,4,B0069556PO,"Tsukimi Kurashita is an eighteen year old young woman living in an old apartment complex with the rest of ""The Sisterhood"" - a group of female otaku (nerds in the presumably worst sense of the word) with varying obsessive hobbies, Tsukimi's being a love of jellyfish.  One day, a beautiful, confident young woman helps her rescue a jellyfish from the uninformed local pet shop and bunks in her room after they return to the apartment complex and see to the jellyfish.  In the morning, however, Tsukimi is shocked and dismayed to find that the new pal she just had a sleepover with is actually a trannie.

Little does she know that the young man, Kuranosuke Koibuchi, is about to become the best friend of her life - and the best thing that ever happened to the apartment residents.

The dub ranges from good to excellent.  Maxey Whitehead, best known for the stir she made upon taking over the role of Alphonse Elric in the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise once Aaron Dismuke had to bow out after his voice changed, spearheads the cast with likeable vulnerability as Tsukimi.  The standout of the supporting cast is a nigh unrecognizable Monica Rial striking comic gold as the manic Records of Three Kingdoms otaku Mayaya.  But the real revelation is Josh Grelle as Kuranosuke.  Not only does he switch effortlessly between an extremely believable drag voice and Kuranosuke's natural voice out of costume; but he also embodies both Kuranosuke's unbreakable spirit, unwilling to cave in to family expectations he knows will make him miserable, and the sensitivity of a young man trying to honorably ignore feelings that he deems inappropriate once a mutual attraction develops between Tsukimi and his half-brother, who meet through him - all while becoming the emotional bridge enabling Tsukimi to overcome her fear of interacting with men.

Although there's a somewhat innuendo-laden subplot that arguably ramps Princess Jellyfish up to a 16+ rating, it is basically a warm, tender story that makes it Fruits Basket's big sister in spirit, if not in content.  I for one hope that a second limited series will follow.",1330905600,24,2113,4.960339943342777

Not only do they have issues with mingling with the outside world, they have a fear of ""The Stylish"" that turns their resolve to stone. One day Tsukimi finds herself in quite the predicament, seeing two jellies that might harm or even kill one another in a pet store window, mixed in one tank. As she tries to intervene, a Stylish comes to her aid. This intervention turns into a whole lot more than she bargained for.

This is a nice release, tried out an advanced copy and I loved it. not only is the image crisp and the sound superb, but i was a bit  surprised by the fact that both languages tracks are done well. Normally, the English is not worth watching but it is done pretty good - as well as dubbing goes anyhow - with this. Also included on the set is the Jellyfish Field guide, some commentary, and a few basics you get with many other sets (you're talking a run time of an hour or so). Depending on where this is obtained, a Clara keychain can also be included in the set.

Princess Jellyfish had so many components in it that made it the perfect show. I do not want to ruin any of the Stylish surprises or the plotline as it develops so I'll try out funny and cute and touching in a lot of places as well. Tsukimi is really likable, growing on you from the go, and her cast of friends are pretty funny. You get to know the people involved, and each is characterized really well. Clara and the way she pops in is humorous but it also takes you to a place in Tsukimi that makes more and more sense as things develop, making you feel for her. I enjoyed that immensely.
