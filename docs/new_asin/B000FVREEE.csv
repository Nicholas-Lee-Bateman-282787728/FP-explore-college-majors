8127327,5,B000FVREEE,GREAT REVIEW OF 2005 MOTO GP SEASON.REASONBLY PRICED. THREE  HOURS OF EXCITING ACTION.MOTO GP RACING MAKES WATCHING OTHER MOTORSPORTS DULL BY COMPARISON.,1369872000,,153,5.954545454545454
8127328,5,B000FVREEE,"THIS YEAR WAS THE MOST DOMINANT PERFORMANCE BY A RACER EVER IN THE PREMIER CLASS! ROSSI IS UNREAL IN THE 2005 SEASON. FROM THE 1ST RACE HE SETS THE TONE BY GOING TO SURGERY ON GIBERNAU AND QUICKLY RUNS AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE FIELD. DON'T GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION THOUGH THERE ARE LOTS OF COMPETITIVE RACES THAT WILL KEEP YOU GLUED TO YOUR SEAT AND A FEW UNEXPECTED NAMES SHOWED OUT THIS YEAR.THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO THIS DVD IS THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP OVER THE ONBOARD LAP BEFORE EACH RACE BUT HAVE TO FASTFORWARD IT WHICH REALLY IS NOT A BIG DEAL, IF YOU ARE A ROSSI FAN OR LOVE MOTORCYCLE RACING THIS DVD IS A MUST HAVE IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.",1258416000,,641,4.136
8127329,5,B000FVREEE,"If you wanna see one of the most gifted racers to ever hop on a motorcycle, buy this DVD and watch the the race at Donington Park, Great Britain.  One of Rossi's best performances in a blow-out season.",1213747200,,201,4.2894736842105265
8127330,1,B000FVREEE,"There were 17 rounds in 2005. In each round, we get a length repeated introduction, stock tourist footage of places like Bruno, Sachsenring and Assen (just in case you were planning a visit other than to see a GP) and a few minutes of highlghts. Then there's an on-board lap (apparently useful to some GP riders) but unlike past years, they don't even bother to inform who the rider is. They cut most of the post-race interviews and all 125cc and 250cc coverage, a feature of prior years. Finally, there's the racing. Some of the most exciting footage ever, reduced to soporific four-minute outtakes. Compare the same company's 2002 or 2001 offerings and it's clear someone at Duke is ripe for new challenges.",1163289600,8,709,4.772357723577236
8127331,2,B000FVREEE,"What has happened to Duke? There were 17 rounds in 2005. In a DVD advertised as 180 minutes, we get, in every round mind you, four separate plays of the cartoon characters with a synthesized ""Are you ready boots?"" Then each round has stock tourist footage of places like Bruno, Sachsenring and Assen (just in case you were planning a visit other than to see a GP). Then there's an on-board lap (apparently useful to some GP riders) but unlike past years, they don't even bother to inform who the rider is. So that's a full 119 minutes of filler. They cut all but 15 seconds from the post-race interviews. And they cut all 125 and 250 coverage, a feature of prior years. Finally, there's the racing. Some of the most exciting footage ever, reduced to soporific four-minute outtakes. Compare the same company's 2002 or 2001 offerings and it's clear someone at Duke is ripe for new challenges. Guys, it's quite simple. Show the races, comment on them.",1162080000,3,948,4.648809523809524
