6731295,5,B00OA4YLCU,"The Regular Show is the best current show on CN in my opinion. I was really happy with the selected episodes for this pack. It's the first release to contain Mordecai and C.J episodes, which are really enjoyable. I own the Rigby pack as well, and I honestly enjoy the episodes from this pack a bit more. All 16 episodes from this pack are some of the best from the whole series. The show has been really slow with season releases, but this pack is a great buy for the time being.",1422835200,2,479,4.217391304347826
6731296,1,B00OA4YLCU,"Regular Show needs proper releases already and less dvd compilations. Adventure Time, which debuted at the same time in 2010, has had four season releases both in dvd and bluray format. Regular show has had a simultaneous bluray/dvd release (containing seasons 1 and 2) and one dvd release with season 3 (no bluray version). With season 6 already started, I begin to wonder when we will get seasons 4 and 5. I am also curious if we will even get a high def release. These dvd releases are redundant, low effort, and are hardly of any value. Hold out for full season set. I know I will be.",1416873600,7,588,4.453703703703703
