1900367,4,B0000A0DWS,"International Crime, 1938 film

The movie begins with a view of a tall building at dusk. [A table-top model.] ""The Shadow"", a famous criminologist, reads a script for a radio program. ""Honest John"" the safebreaker is back in town. There is a tip about a robbery. ""He had an honest face."" Could a radio show create a crime wave? ""I owe you an apology."" An explosion in the Morton mansion brings in the police. Cranston is held as a material witness until a ""habeas corpus"" is served. Cranston wants to investigate Morton's background. His brother Roger shows up with his attorney to complain about the allegations. Lamont and Phoebe visit restaurants to look for that tipster. They find him, and Lamont, posing as a countryman, gets his name. ""An amateur."" Cranston visits an apartment and learns more. He writes an article in the newspaper claiming knowledge of the murderers. What if he is wrong? ""The Shadow"" will resign!

Cranston tries to follow that car, but ""Honest John"" joins him in that taxi. ""This is the final edition."" ""Have a cigarette."" [Note the carrying of pistols then.] Phoebe Lane fills in for the Shadow. A black Packard drops off those two foreigners at the Morton house. ""The deal will never be concluded."" They rob the safe. ""It is a matter of international diplomacy."" They want to halt a bond issue of a foreign country! Can they frame a man to cause his suicide? Cranston and ""Honest John"" arrive in time to saved Roger Morton and capture the spies. The police detectives arrive next. Cranston makes a broadcast to wrap up the case. ""Crime does not pay.""

This low budget movie is above average because of its combination of drama, comedy, and foreign intrigue. Few movies brought up the subject of foreign bonds and their effect on the domestic economy. Many Americans were swindled in the 1920s into buying foreign bonds which defaulted on their payments. The loss of savings enriched the brokers and resulted in the Great Depression, just as the ""Housing Bubble"" swindled the buyers of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations in this Depression. Beware of novel financial instruments which have not stood the test of time. Selling a mortgage without the underlying note was supposed to be illegal in the past; this prevented selling a mortgage more than once. Wall Street always needs more regulation to control their swindles.",1297468800,,2352,4.9045226130653266

1900373,4,B0000A0DWS,"These old mystery/crime drama's are good fun! The hero is always smarter then the cops which adds for a bit of comedy. Love and romance always comes our hero's way of course.

1900376,4,B0000A0DWS,"I actually liked this movie and actors/characters portrayed.  However, while this uses the name ""The Shadow"" and ""Lamont Cranston"", this is nothing like the radio shadow or the Alec Baldwin ""The Shadow"" movie.  This character hosts a radio show from his newspaper and harasses police and criminals alike as he pursues the case.  Instead of Margo Lane, the lead female is Phoebe Lane.  This is the second of two Rod LaRocque movies with the Shadow name, so perhaps they explain why Phoebe instead of Margo.",1453507200,,505,4.905882352941177

1900388,1,B0000A0DWS,"I enjoy many an old movie, esp. mysteries like the Thin Man series, Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes, and more. This movie is not good. It tries to be a fun mystery with the smart detective and silly sidekick lady, but it doesn't pull it off. The writing and acting aren't good and it was boring.",1427328000,,290,4.388888888888889

1900395,5,B0000A0DWS,"If you like movies from this era, I recommend to give this one a try.  It is in the style of His Girl Friday with snappy dialog and the vague feeling that you are watching a stage production - which I personally like.
I watched this movie streaming live with Amazon Prime and the quality was very good.",1389484800,4,302,4.206896551724138
1900396,2,B0000A0DWS,I'm old enough to remember the original shadow radio programs sponsored by Blue Coal. The only thing that was worse than Rod LaRoche as the shadow was the script he had to read. One plus was the picture of the real shadow on Rod's office wall.,1378252800,,243,4.304347826086956
1900397,4,B0000A0DWS,"Though the resemblance to the famous radio show is sketchy, this second entry in the ""B"" movies about The Shadow, otherwise known as Lamont Cranston, is quite fun. Rod La Rocque adds more than a dash of charm and humor to his role as Lamont Cranston, who here is a radio crime fighter who uses his show to expose crooks, and often exposes the ineptitude of Commissioner Weston in the process.

Astrid Allwyn is really nice as Phoebe Lane, the station owner's relative who wants to break into radio. She gets Cranston into plenty of hot water when she hands him a note on the air and he announces it without checking it out first. The crime isn't as important as the trappings and the stylish performances in this entry, which includes an excellent turn by Lew Hearn as the cab driver, Moe, who gets Cranston and Lane out of more than one jam as they try to get to the bottom of things.

There is humor and panache in La Roque's performance and the film itself. It is very fun to watch for those who enjoy ""B"" mysteries, and while it may not be exceptional, it is quite enjoyable. It is too bad that more entries in this series, and for that matter, more ""B"" mysteries, aren't as easy and pleasant to watch as this second attempt to cash in on the radio popularity of one of the greatest figures in that medium's history. All-in-all, a fun film.",1372464000,5,1344,4.393574297188755

7995079,4,B0000A0DWS,"A very funny whodunit starring The Shadow, a radio personality/reporter/crime solver. His side-kick is a persistent young lady who always seems to be one step ahead, or behind, The Shadow. The Shadow is also a reporter for the newspaper that sponsors his radio spot and there is an on-going battle between the newspaper and the police commissioner.

For the most part, there is quite a bit going on that is quite entertaining, but the crime itself falls flat in the end. The intrigue just doesn't build like it should. In spite of that, I think the movie is worth watching because of the tension between The Shadow and The Commissioner, and between The Shadow and his side-kick.
