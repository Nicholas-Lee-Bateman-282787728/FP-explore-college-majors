5472300,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The discs play fine. The first five seasons had swinging plastic pages to hold the discs. The sixth season stacked all of the discs on a single plastic peg.

Downton Abbey captivated me for several seasons. It was different, unlike any other series I was watching. I enjoyed the entire series and plan on rewatching the show. The locations and scenery and likable characters were great. It's not without its flaws. For instance, in the fourth season I was wondering what Thomas' job was. All he does is stand around, spying on people. Is he the spymaster? In season five I found some of the situations and characters tedious and boring. But overall I liked the series very much.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2143,5.445783132530121

5472314,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I always like a mid-series review, just to get my impressions down before the 2nd half of the series alters it too much.  Season 1 was really strong, Season 2 had its own strengths, with the compelling story of the War and the tides of change.  Season 3 faltered a bit, but in a series with this level of attention to detail, a season spent exploring the characters and the estate was not amiss.

However season 4 (2-3 episodes in) has all of the flaws and few of the strengths of the previous 3 seasons.  Everything feels tired and played out, like the concept of hereditary nobility in 1922.

The bad:

-The Bates storyline.  At this point, Bates could be elected Prime Minister and it wouldn't surprise me.  A soldier turned valet turned convict turned butler with a heart of gold whose fatal flaw is that he's just TOO honorable.  Mr. Bates is the saccharine-tablet of this little banquet.  As far as I'm concerned neither Bates adds anything to the storyline at this point.  Simply put, they're walking stereotypes of the honorable servant, and Mr. Bates first name might as well be Job instead of John.  *mild spoiler* have just finished watching the Ep. where Anna gets assaulted by rando guest's valet.  I think the writers were attempting for a Sopranos reference, but they bungled it through laziness.  As with all Bates drama, there's one simple solution that would resolve 20 minutes of wasted screentime in 30 seconds.  Anna calls the police... they show up, arrest the guy, now Bates can no longer murder him in a fit of passion.  Instead, there's a lot of allusion to morals/character/lose women in the decision not to.  It's lazy writing for about eight reasons I can point to.  1) Drama is introduced very randomly.  Whether its Tom and Obrien disliking him, angst over his knee, his crazy ex, the weird murder conviction, prison... it seems like Bates is Job. 2) the actor who plays Bates simply isn't convincing.  I think the problem is that the actor really is kind of a smug douche (no offense) in real life, so there's a tremendous disconnect between that and the Biff Loman he's trying to play.  The writers could have had his character change or grow. 3) Just like with Kemal Pamuk the Turkish Crepuk the rapey butler is a cold, calculating psychopath.  He follows the same pattern of meet, charm, win social approval, and inspire jealousy - then isolate and assault.  He seems to think the same way... that any kind of accusation will be met with disbelief. 5) however, he's just a valet... and Anna is married.  Both those things would cut very sharply against him even in whatever farcical court system existed at the time.  6) even were they decide to keep a scandal quiet, one work from Lord G to the butler's employer kills his career. 7) Now Anna is trying to be noble and sacrifice herself for Job, I mean John... how original.  There have only been 87 times where John has made a hash of things (not telling the police he bought the rat poison months ago?).  Is the dark message here that John and Anna are actually too stupid to exist in Edwardian England. 8) the writers are not that clever.

The Ugly

Lady Mary.  Honestly, she's played out and less interesting than the old Ladies.  What started out as a kind of quaintly charming Jane Austen reference has turned into something offensive to the viewer.  Her speech patterns and mannerisms are worn out, because there's nothing of substance to them (again lazy writing).  Did the writers plan Lady Mary to take more of a role, then realize that they'd cast someone whose acting ability fell far short?  She goes from perhaps a millennial re-imagining of a Jane Austin stereotype into... a Jane Austen stereotype... into a soap opera... into... pure shlock?  Mary is so uninteresting, so insipidly boring, that the most tumultous events barely dent her ennui.  Oh War has broken out?  ""I'm tired darling, think I'll rest.""  Oh Matthew's dead... ""I'm tired darling, I need rest.""  Again, the writers are not clever enough for this, but the only way Lady Mary is a little more interesting is if she's a secret laudanum addict (rewatch any of her scenes and ask yourself if opiates may not be the explanation).

Lord Grantham -- he certainly hasn't learned anything from the last decade, except that the Granthams will still keep winning the lottery in terms of heirs, but suffering deaths at an alarming rate.  Heck, the man hasn't even found time to age!  His character now exists as a placeholder, a reminder of the monumental foolishness of a bankrupt nobility.

Lady Cora.  -- a season or two ago, I figured it out.  The actress who plays her really only has one neutral/happy expression... crosseyed and vampy.  Not sure if they wanted to make her stereotypical/cliched American for a British audience, or if she just can't act that well.  There's something really off about her, as if maybe she's taking a milder dose of Mary's laudanum.

('Lady') Rose -- I appreciate what they're trying to do... make her into a flapper, show us how what we find fuddy-duddy was shocking at the time.  It seems they wrote Sybil out and her in, in roughly the same role... but for whatever reason it doesn't work.  She's too vapid, and doesn't have the street cred of being a nurse in WWI.  Rose is purely about hedonism, she seems pretty eager to give up the trappings of nobility.  But all that means is that she gets into trouble and others get her out of it.. much like the early days of Sybil.  Around and Around and back where we started

TL;DR:  stop watching at the end of season 3.  There's no need to witness the decline of a noble house and noble characters due to lazy writing and played out plotlines.",1516492800,,5688,4.649949849548646
5472315,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"What a wonderful series!!!! All of the characters were wonderful and the story lines with servants,  the Crawleys, and everyone else is amazing! From tears to claps to getting mad, I haven't felt in tune with a series like I have this one. As much as Lady Mary can be cruel, I fell in love with her. Violet and Mary were my favorites, but who am I kidding... I loved all of them. Conspiring with one another to the love stories, I am simplh amazed. For it to be a PBS production, I am shocked that it was this great! If you like time period pieces, this is a great one to watch!",1516320000,,578,4.115044247787611

But a question, if anyone reads this.......(mild spoiler alert)
It seems to us that in season 4, episodes 8 and 9 are switched. My wife first noticed that the dates had gone backwards, from 8 to 0, at least in how they are arranged here on AP. Also.... the dates, in episode 8, Edith's baby was already back on England and in Episode 9, she makes the decision, it seems, to go retrieve her. That's backwards.

Anyone else notice this?",1500768000,,600,4.445454545454545

5473899,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I know this review is very late since the show is off the air.  I will say the first three season were pretty good. But when Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens boy does he have some pretty eyes) died the show should have ended there. The next three season were just repeat story lines, with different people and different places.
With many holes in the story, many areas that the average human beings would not react in the way the characters are reacting or do what the characters are doing.

For example. (I like her character and the actress who plays her, but I don't think they made actress Michelle Dockery pretty or attractive in this series) and how is it that all of these suitors wanted to marry her after they had only met her for 5 mins.?  And how is it that Anna fights to prove her husband John innocence of killing his estranged wife but does not want to tell him who the man was that attacked her because she knew John would kill him?
And seriously a pregnant Edith goes off with an aunt to Switzerland for months to have her baby and give it away (to keep it a secret from her parents and Downton Abbey) really?

In the beginning of the series l loved Matthew, quite frankly he deserved someone better than Mary. (Mary's character is harsh and self serving)
Also the relationship with Anna and John started out being a wonderful love story. But by season 4 was on repeat and the characters and relationship went no where.
There is so much to say about the series as a whole but mostly the first three seasons would get 4 or 5 stars and seasons 4-6 a 1 star.

However, I will point out that the writer or writers did a great job as far as writing content for so many lead characters and even the supporting characters.

But, my favorite characters are grand ma ma (played by Maggie Smith) and Isobel Crawley(played by Julian Fellowes) they made the series.",1475712000,4,1876,4.39193083573487

5474218,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I thought this show was going to be as boring as an old English lady drinking tea, but I have been pleasantly surprise.  Surprisingly, the old English lady drinking tea is the funniest person on the show, and I don't mean that in a bad way.  The show, in spite of the boring-looking cover and boring-sounding title, is shockingly watchable and full of interesting drama.  Most importantly, it's a snapshot of the time period between the World Wars that a lot of us don't see.  I can't recommend this enough.",1473465600,,507,4.6

5474225,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Good writing, directing, and performances. And the setting and costumes are fabulous. One thing that bugged me was how things seemed to go on forever, and then were resolved in moments. The final clash with Mary and Edith had been building for some time, then it was suddenly all over and Mary's all grown-up and mature. Plus, I never really did know why they despised each other so much. I would have liked more oomph there. Also, Cora and Robert were pretty quick to judge ~ ie: when that replacement for O'Brian comes on the scene (her second time at Downton) and sets Anna up. Cora is too quick to believe Anna capable of such pettiness, as is Robert when he later brings the issue up to Bates.",1473465600,,698,4.4609375
5474226,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This whole series is my ultimate favorite. Enjoyed the ends and outs of the family during  late 1800 to 1925. It is sad the fall happened shortly after this period.,1473465600,,164,4.466666666666667

Reminds me of some of the older television shows that still have all of the drama, but don't have some of the language and sexually content that seems to be in most shows now and quite frankly I don't miss that at all.

I always feel like I could step right into either the upstairs or downstairs society and feel at home. I also like the way all the characters grow as the years go by, some setting aside prejudice, others leaving their pride for understanding. The natural way that the love grows between the couples is so charming.",1473033600,,442,4.5375

5474269,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is a well written program.  I enjoy learning how the upper crust society expects to be treated at all times.  The staff at Downton Abbey do the jobs expected of them.  There is very little room to aspire to be more though on occasions one has stepped out and spread their wings.

It is a strong and gripping vision of life in the beginning of the 20th century, complete with how society behaved in that time period. The loss of the youngest daughter in childbirth, the horrors of w.w,1 brings home the reality of that time period. It's a great adventure.",1466812800,,331,4.533333333333333

5474852,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey gives a wonderful look into the world of the British elite.  The characters are well developed and you really get a feel for how they will act in certain situations.  I find the clothing so amazing!  The plot can be slow, but it mirrors the times, and it is always interesting to me to explore the relationship between staff and the family.",1466812800,,354,4.5
5474853,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This season is so fast paced ands eventful,1466812800,,42,4.375
5474854,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Though it is a romanticized view of domestic labor in that era, I still enjoy the character development, drama, cinematography, costuming, beautiful diction. It's historical fiction like Gone With The Wind, meaning it's more fairy tale than fact written without representing the grinding nature of slavery in the American South or service in the UK.  Yet, there is a more palpable feeling of what he era could have been like and the way WWI shook up the social order.  I love this series and with its flaws, will enjoy it repeatedly.  I am in season four and will savor all the way to the end. Many issues that women faced and still face are shown something short of full horror.  People might not keep watching if it was more realistic and painful.  There is enough heart warming overall.  Great lines delivered by Maggie Smirh  make it good entertainment even without all else.",1466812800,,879,4.743421052631579

I was very sad to see the series end.  Too many shows use gratuitous violence, sex, and filthy language to make a point, which makes me wonder about the intellectual capacity of its creators.  Downton Abbey was the opposite.  I sincerely hope that the creators of this series will make another one.  I am a fan!",1466208000,,471,4.614457831325301

5474957,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is not intense drama insofar as nobody points a gun at anybody.  Its genius is to present sympathetically the very different points of view of  the people involved.  Once again the familiar characters navigate the maze of a changing class system and the changing status of women, in this series between WW's 1 and 2.  The geographical setting is a surpassingly beautiful country home in Northern England in which an aristocratic family in close proximity to their servants progress through difficult times.  The overarching plot is to secure the succession of the noble aristocratic line in the absence of a son, a duty which devolves to a distant and reluctant cousin. The family struggles to accept changing social mores as it affects their daughters, in particular the betrothal of one of them to an Irish Socialist. Thrown into the mix are engaging sub plots and various romances.  The historical setting is accurate, the acting very accomplished and the videography is superb.",1465948800,,986,5.055555555555555

It's classy and educational. Something you don't find on TV much anymore. Unless it's reruns of the Walton's, Little House on the Pirie, Brady Bunch, Bonanza etc., shows  that demonstrate morals.

5475648,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have been an on again/off again fan from the second season.  I came into series in the second season, and watched through the third at that time, but when they killed Matthew and the season ended, my interests moved into other things.  But, having enjoyed the first three seasons immensely, I decided to check back in, as it were.  Unfortunately...
Something has happened this season...the writing is poorer, the situations are far more contrived, and the story-line is just tracking along without thought or plot, other than the most played out pairings and ""tying up of loose ends"".
Seriously?  Is EVERYONE going to get married and have a happy little life now?  I valued this series for it's relative believability, but this has become rather ridiculous.
On one side, it was nice, in a very juvenile sort of way, to see that everyone is being taken care of and everyone gets a trite happy ending...but I had more respect for this series than that.  Obviously, I was incorrect.  I feel almost betrayed, though I'm not sure that I have a right to feel that way, not really.
But, whether I have the right or not, I'm not a fan of the laziness of the progression here, not to mention the characters are being shuffled off with dispatch...it almost leaves me to wonder who will be around for season 5...if I bother to watch.

For all the negatives, the show is still beautiful, the costumes are period and exceedingly well done, the architecture and interiors are, as always, stunning.  Though the attention to detail about how upper-class life was conducted has very much slipped this season, the echoes are still there in many of the scenes.  Since I was a child I was always fascinated by the Victorian/Edwardian period in England, and this series has given an incredibly precise and thorough view into that world, even if liberties were taken with relationships and realities.
(That ruler...the one that *measures the place settings* gets me every time, lol!)

I am glad to have seen through this season, for the sake of completeness, but I have to wonder if I'm going to bother investing in season 5 at this point, or just wait until it hopefully comes online for free through amazon prime.  I can continue working on my sewing projects without losing anything in either money or time as I complete out the series, so I believe at this time I will hold out.

I'm torn between two and three stars here...there are some high points, and it's certainly not horrible...But the quality I had come to expect is certainly lacking.",1461196800,,2528,4.718181818181818

I would not say that the stories are gripping nor are you on the edge of your seat; it's not that kind of series. But we like how the writers strike a balance of likable vs. unlikable characters. The actors, sets, scenery, and costumes are top drawer, and the pace is quick. The storylines are intelligent and the dialogue is crisp. You will enjoy the character development as they overcome difficulties and tackle individual challenges. It's just pure pleasure to watch and learn how English aristocracy interacts with their servant staff. Highly recommended.",1458000000,,668,4.817391304347826

This was truly a television jewel, and my only regret is that  I did not watch it in the beginning. I have not had a chance to watch the 6th and final season because now my Firestick wants to charge me a fee. But I know that I will pay it so that i can see the final episode. My daughter sent me a link including a list of books for that time period, for those who are having Downton Abbey withdrawals.  I have already ordered one of them on my Kindle.

Brava PBS, it was a look at end and turn of the century life in England that I would have never experienced, the requirement and teaching of manners, and the care of the servants by the aristocracy, although we know that all households of the period were not that caring and all servants were not that loyal. Still is showed the better side of a bygone era. Absolutely charming and acting and character development that is truly outstanding.",1458000000,4,1031,4.276923076923077

5476421,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I just finished viewing season 4 on Amazon Prime.  As I stated in my review of season 3, this is hands down the finest series ever produced on television.  I heartily wish there were a season 7, and a season 8, and a season 9...The lives of the characters are so compellingly presented that their stories and dramas reach into our own lives and teach us how to live a bit more honorably, a bit more civilly, a bit less villainously.  I am used to being transported back in time and held in thrall by an excellently written book, but honestly, a television series has never hit that mark for me.  This one did.  Every episode, every season is absolutely outstanding, delighting, enthralling, entertaining, captivating...well, I just don't have enough superlatives to describe the Downton Abbey series!",1456617600,7,800,4.810218978102189

5476995,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"So far it has not been the great ending I had thought it might be.  More of an afterthought and glossed over and hurried up, etc.  Kind of disappointing, but great actors and actresses and good to watch at any rate.  Just nothing as good as the first ones which is generally the case with series pieces.  The Tudors was the exception as I was riveted to each and every episode, but some more than others  DA has kind of gone down hill as it went and probably just lived it life out as most series do.  Just been an excellent one in many ways, however, and did not want to take that away from the creator or the actors and actresses.  Just a great mix and some better than others; but all contributed to the whole.  Thoroughly enjoyed it all and hope there will be more coming.  ;o)  Glad to see all the pieces available, but not interested in buying CD's, DVD's, etc.  PBS and/or Masterpiece needs to do the download bit and charge or rent like all the rest.  I quit buying the standalone stuff a long time ago as it quickly becomes old technology whereas download is whatever is the latest and greatest and fastest.  The future, not the past.  That would be a nice change  I was watching mine through Prime, but trying to decide what service, etc. at the moment.  Just need something like that.  Thanks!",1454544000,,1304,4.344398340248962

5476999,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The entire series has been one of the finest and most entertaining television productions I've ever seen.  It is so well researched in an effort to historically reflect the Edwardian time of class structure, from dress, to levels of responsibilities, to customs, to how world events began to change and impact that whole period from the 1910's through the 1920-30's.  The characters seem real so the selection of actors was done with care and each perform their roles with professionalism rarely seen from such a large cast of characters.",1454457600,,538,5.033707865168539

5477037,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have indulged my love of period drama by watching the British version of Downton Abbey after learning that our PBS offering was only five episodes long and theirs was nine episodes each season.  Apparently, the powers that be felt that Americans would neither understand nor care about how property was transferred down through generations in order for the great estates to remain in tact.  So, much of the main story line, around which the plot was built, was cut out for American consumption.  However, that leaves the finished product with an overall ""choppy"" feeling and questions that seem to go unanswered.  The British version, to my mind at least, develops the characters more fully, giving them more reasons for the actions they take, therefore making the plot points more tidy and less confusing.  I have been binge watching, one or two episodes each evening before bedtime, and have enjoyed every minute.  I liked the PBS version, but I LOVE the British version!",1454284800,,975,4.950920245398773

5477072,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is a fairly unique show with an interesting story about the changes in the English upper class in the early 1900's.  I thought it would be stuffy and not entertaining but have found that to be wrong.  The show has a lot of humor if you're paying attention as it is subtle but consistently there with the off hand remarks of the characters that you have to learn to know when they are getting in a good dig as part of one of their comments.  It is educational in the showing of how the upper class estates provided jobs and where the cornerstone of the economy at one time, but the industrial revolution and social change eliminated them as a middle class was introduced.  It isn't a show I thought I would like but once you learn the characters and understand the workings of ""high society"" it is very entertaining with a lot of drama to accompany the evolution of society that occurred during that period of history.  You have to pay attention to pick up on the wit woven into the dialog of the mostly very stuffy characters, but people are people and they exibit all the flaws and entertaining quirks of modern day if paying attention.  I find it quite entertaining.",1454284800,,1182,4.474418604651163

5477142,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey Season 4 and 5 were superb.  What is not great is the sudden asking for passwords for MPBN to get the current final season.  What gives.

My wife has watched this wonderful show from its inception.  I was slower to warm up to this show, but I now follow it with anticipation.

A good alternative following the departure of Downtown Abbey is the PBS series ""Foley's War"" set in WW II England.  It ran for 9 seasons.  We watch it on either Amazon Firestick, or Netflix.",1454112000,,516,4.3125

Perhaps Amazon is impatient or their process for sending emails for viewer ratings is incapable of distinguishing the difference between a single movie or show and a series. Either way, all I can offer is my humble opinion that this entire series is fantastic.  The first episode of this season was not overly emotionally impactfull, but does inspire want in future viewing.

5477276,5,B00AQVMZKQ,One of the many things I love about Downton Abbey is that the show keeps you on the edge of your seat with most all the characters and how all the storylines run together in the end.

I get it...I just really struggle with all the tech stuff.  If it's not simple, I can't do it and refuse to be frustrated by it.  I understand ...It's progress.

I have decided not to purchase season 6 until I find out if all episodes are the U.K. version. I was a bit upset that series 4 followed the time-honored plot device of highlighting a younger character when the traditional ones were perceived as getting too old to interest younger viewers. Lady Sybil seems to have been replaced by Lady Rose. While she is an enjoyable character, this is done in too many shows to hold any special interest to me.",1451692800,,559,4.436893203883495

5477627,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I tend to wait till a seasons over then buy the whole DVD. But I didn't this time when I read reviews about Anna being assaulted. Thankfully I changed my mind. As always the costumes and scenery are sumptuous But it's the development of the characters that make this show successful Dame Maggie Smith is still tremendous as the grand Dowager But some of the most touching moments are between her and poor Matthews Mum. Lady Mary's emergence from her grief to deciding to take up what Matthew started and work to save Downton is great-nice to see a woman in this time period speak up and be heard. Anna's assault was heartbreaking And Bates tearful realization of what happened is a Kleenex moment We're left with a possible moral dilemma Anna's attacker meets an untimely death shoved into traffic Bates was in London on the day of the death Did Bates kill him? And is it really a crime to end the life of a monster who would not have been arrested for what he did? At the end of it we know Anna would have had no peace until her attacker was dead Lady Edith has a small, though unknown to most of her family, scandal Having a illegitimate child-we learn the child will be coming to stay at a nearby farm Will Edith's secret be kept? Will the father of the child appear? Some characters however seemed to have no purpose Braithwait as The lady of the abbeys maid is barely there then gone again The scandal it seems was a one night stand with Tom but it goes nowhere And of course Thomas the closeted gay footman who broods and make snarky comments, seems to have no purpose. Shirley McLaine reappears and brings Paul Giamatti with her,but neither are given much to do or say Roses introduction as court is a nice piece of history How the upper classes behaved and what made them more superior to others We see technology arriving with electricity, fridges and a food mixer Its well written and funny in the right places As we know WW2 is approaching Will the Abbey survive, will the servants move with the times and leave? I'm truely looking forward to the next season. But still crossing my fingers that Bates and Anna get their happily ever after",1448755200,,2149,4.470737913486005

5477629,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Somehow after Matthew's death, the lustre of Downton came down by a notch for me. It's become more soapy. Matthew had a star quality to him that is hard to replace. His presence was magnetic with those deep, intelligent and penetrating eyes and sunny smile. His manner of portrayal also was very english in that he held back rather than bare everything. I missed him throughout season-4. It seems that Season-3 tamed Thomas a bit but he's gone off the rails once more. But what a handsome man Thomas is. Season-5 already has gone into the realm of the soap.",1448582400,,557,4.58

5478099,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"This season doesn't cause as much stress, distress and depression as season 3 and makes it easier to follow around with each character, a factor which helps people like me prevent semi-anxiety and spikes in blood pressure.  Those of us who too easily interpret phases of fiction with reality will find this season a comfortable change.

We still lose connection and video content, making it difficult to keep up with conversations; not as bad as earlier on, but still distracts and requires re-playing some segments.",1444521600,,516,5.0588235294117645

5478327,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I think I've had about all that I can take of this show right now. I can handle the death of cherished characters but, what happens to Anna was far too much. My stomach was so twisted at the end of 4:2 that I had to switch to Who's Line is it Anyways in order to cheer up and calm down. I would have been much happier if I stopped at the end of season 3. Downton Abby used to be a little lighter but has, since the first two seasons, gotten really dark, in my opinion.

Well written show with excellent characters. You will cherish all of them and, that said, you will be heartbroken as terrible things continue to happen in their lives. Be wary.",1443052800,,646,4.086614173228346

5478513,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"The series has me hooked, because I love old houses, vintage clothing and love the cinematography. Not because it's the best thing on TV.

The dialogue, plot and drama too often play out like an afternoon soap opera.

But, both new and veteran actors in this series show how talented they really are, by making a silk purse out of the sow's ear they're tasked with.

I don't know why they try and cram so much into every show, or why the actors are asked to carry forward so many disconnected plot lines, very often ending up with too short, too quickly wrapped up, story lines.

Still, an enjoyable, fun show for a vintage fashion and history lover.",1441324800,,650,4.483050847457627

5478624,5,B00AQVMZKQ,both my wife and I are watching the program and really enjoy it.  Its about the only program we watch together otherwise she watches the Biggest Loser which I don't like and I like to watch history channels.,1440633600,,207,4.447368421052632
5478625,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The 4th season kept the storyline moving at the same pace as the first three seasons.  The characters are realistic and react to plot twists and the introductiion of new people and issues.  The characters continually ""fill out"", and the changes in pre-war society and aristocracy are well paced and accurate.  If you piick up the story from the beginning, you cannot go wring with Downton Abbey on any level.",1440633600,,408,4.8

5478649,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"What the show did to one of the characters was unforgivable.  Yes, some people will argue that the moment was realistic.  The problem is...this is not that type of show.  This was a nice, little show that white washes over actual events (such as the war).  It is almost like a modern day Little House on the Prairie.  Unfortunately, the show takes a sharp turn with one of it's beloved character.  After I finished this season, I gave up on the show and never went back.",1440547200,,470,4.406976744186046

5478665,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4 may be my favorite of all so far - no unnecessary deaths in the plot to get rid of troublesome actors, and a brilliant, award-winning treatment of several social issues in their historic context that both lends insight and showcases the remarkable talent of the actors and writers involved in the show.

5478760,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"Begins with Mary struggling with the loss of Matthew; similarly, his mother also withdraws into her grief. Friends of both try to get them to rejoin the living. In Mary's case, it would be to help with the management of the estate - especially since she's now a half-owner, along with her father - who resists. She meets another and is tempted to accept his marriage offer, but withdraws - not certain herself why. Alfred the footman leaves to pursue a cooking career after winning a paid training program. Cora's playboy brother in America loses much of his fortune. Thomas Barrow continues his skullduggery - persuading the Earl to hire one of his supporters his wife's maid. And Mr. Bates learns why Anna has been so aversive towards him - and simmers.

What repeatedly amazes me is that those involved focus so much on improving revenues from land owned by the Earl, and no attention is given to reducing serving staff within the household - supposedly the biggest drain upon revenues. Further, while the Earl sloughs off the topic as 'not possible to accomplish' and contrary to his dedication to providing employment for people of the village, he ignores the opportunities presented by frequent resignations and the ridiculously low utilization of the servant staff. The inevitable alternative to improved management - simply selling off Downton Abbey, certainly won't help villagers at all.

Also amazing is the Thomas Barrow's employment continues to survive crisis after crisis, despite non-stop extremely inappropriate behavior and dishonesty - at the very least someone ought to have flattened him by now. Then there was Anna - refusing to identify her attacker and contact the police, thereby creating considerable added complication and the risk that Mr. Bates would take revenge on his own. And finally, it's getting quite tiring by now to repeatedly have conversations interrupted just when they were about to make an important and provocative point.

Regardless, Season 4 did not measure up to the prior seasons, and Disc Three of Season 4 was particularly boring.",1439769600,,2080,5.093841642228739

5478805,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Excellent acting and storytelling. My wife and I watched all 4 seasons in about 5 evenings. Since I am from England and know a little bit about the era; I was impressed with the trouble that was taken to be authentic in dress mannerisms and so forth. The stories are compelling and show how all our lives evolve based as a result of war, changing exonomies, social norms and acceptable behaviour. This period changed Great Britain forever and was the beginning of the end of the empire along with those of much of Europe, including Germany and Russia. It was a time of social revolution and changing mores. Downton Abbey does a bang up job of portraying the tides upon which the working class and the upper class rode.",1439510400,,718,4.573643410852713

A lot of characters regressed, a lot of things were recycled, and some of the characters were stuck in tedious plotlines that went nowhere and just sucked a lot of the life out of me.  Furthermore, there was one plotline that I found disgusting and gratuitous.  You'll know the one I mean if you watch.  It seemed to serve no purpose, especially given who it happened to.  It's a frustrating season that is partially redeemed by S5.",1439510400,,487,4.415730337078652

We are currently on Season 4 since it's available via Amazon Instant Video or Netflix. We cannot give high enough praise first to the writers, director, costume & set design, the entire crew who have put their heart & soul into this show. ALL of the actors really make this the classic it's already become. Superb performances by all, even if it's an actor in only 1 episode, they put 110% into it. We'll be so sad whenever Downton comes to an end. Funny, by the end if each episode we find ourselves speaking like proper English royalty!

5478960,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I finally caught up with Downton Abbey but I can't really tell you how I feel because it is likely to hurt someone else. If I told you I thought the series gets better and better - you might think I've forgotten my position in society. Someday I might actually hug or kiss my loved ones but I certainly won't do it until I see them do it on Downton Abbey. I'm thinking I raised my kids wrong too - really wouldn't it have been better if I only saw them once a day. I'm hiring a whole crew of servants so they can fight each other and plot against each other. Oh - and fall in love without ever hugging and kissing.,1438214400,,614,4.0

5479241,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Soap opera with accented English
I got suckered into watching this ongoing soap opera without soap commercials and will likely see it through to the end. I can't tell whether I detest it or adore it.

The characters in the series all seem to have multiple personality disorders, alternating between nice and twisted. Mary is so overplayed as a haughty witch, Carson is a pompous artifact from the 18th century, Thomas is creepy-evil, and the other characters all have their own mental defects fully on display. Only Anna seems to have her heart mostly in a good spot and destined for better days. (Oh, wait. Did she push that rapist into the path of a street car? Jerk had it coming, so maybe good DOES triumph over evil.)",1436054400,,722,4.640625

Thomas has been undergoing some difficult personal issues and his cousin(?) Edna actually is nothing like O'Brien who was a witch of the first order. Did you not notice that Thomas originally had something on Edna in hopes he could manipulate her but found instead a person of integrity and quiet strength? Yes, the Granthams make assumptions in their dealings with their servants, but they are of a different era than Mary's and Matthew's (RIP) generation.",1435104000,,576,4.887755102040816

5479748,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm on my toes, waiting for season 5. Downton Abbey has everything a well written TV series can have: love and betrayal, fairy tale moments, finding then loosing innocence, moments of true portrayal of the aristocratic lives in the given historical time, intrigue and politics, personal tragedies and triumphs.
Watching the first couple of episodes in season 1 left me nothing short of wanting more and more. I found my husband curled up besides me longer and longer when he caught me watching this amazing saga - he is an admitted Donwton Abbey junkie now and proposed to start to watch the series from the beginning all over again.

Watching Donwton Abbey is a great way to spend the allowed TV-time. Careful! It is addictive!",1433030400,,728,4.824
5479749,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This series is very well done. It portraits faithfully the British society of the beginning of the XX Century.

5479908,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Good way to escape from today's troubling times to a time where everyone ( or almost everyone ) seems to know his or her place in the order of society.  In the U.S. And possibly in the present UK such rigid social lines would be awkward, and for upward mobile people unacceptable.  Still the series is a mostly pleasant look backward to that time in England when the structure of society was undergoing tremendous change.",1431993600,,421,4.6

5479920,3,B00AQVMZKQ,Other than gorgeous cinematography this show feels worn. The producers have killed off their best characers who could create a little tension in the plot lines. We're stuck with a brooding Mary and an ever clueless Lord Blowhard.,1431993600,,229,5.052631578947368

5479936,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Mostly a disappointment after the first three seasons. Plots seemed tired with little flow or connection to the past. It's difficult to do justice to so many characters. Throughout the entire series, I found Cora to be irritating and one-dimensional. This season was no exception. As always, Bates and Anna--as well as Carson, Mrs. Hughes and the cook--and the delightful Daisy--provided the high points. Mary has turned to ice, apparently. The two males competing for her attention are so insipid, this viewer doesn't care which--if either--prevails. Rose's behavior is so bizarre, it lacks credibility. Also, there are the usual lapses which suggest these series have been edited and not in a good way.",1431820800,,704,5.238938053097345

5480001,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I have enjoyed the series greatly.  I have always been interested in English gentry and how life was lived in those glorious palaces.  Through Downton Abby I feel like an honored guest who is the confidant of the entire household.  I have particularly enjoyed the grandmothers.  The ladies acting these parts are excellent.  I have cried with them and laughed out loud at them.  Well done.  I look forward to the remaining seasons and sad to know 2016 will be the end.,1431648000,,468,4.634146341463414

5480071,3,B00AQVMZKQ,They lost me when they raped Anna. She is such a sweet character and I found the violence unnecessary for a story that could have stood the test of time. It seems that the wonderful world of Downton Abbey has been invaded by today's world. The wonderful sets and costumes continue but the trashiness of Lady Rose even affected my view of the actress in Cinderella. The series is no longer on my need-to-watch list; I have switched to Doc Martin.,1431302400,,445,4.506172839506172

However, after Season 3's loss of primary characters, Season 4 delved into strictly soap opera territory.  I barely made it through the season and did not tune into season five at all.",1430352000,,352,4.85

Then they shape up for that person and go wrong for someone else on the same manufactured plot schedule.  The people with power are consistently blind to the bad ones downstairs while they are consistently accusatory toward the innocent, upstairs and down, like they're blinder'n bats.  The direction of the plot seems predictable even as the details vary.  Nevertheless the production is typically English-superb, and the acting is, of course, unbeatable.",1429401600,,588,5.23404255319149

I don't know what is happening with TV stations, they have something good and they take it off, but they leave these stupid shows on, that are extremely violent and no good.  Maybe some other stations will bring good shows like this one on.  I HOPE THEY RECONSIDER LEAVING THIS ONE ON!!!

I am just glad that I didn't have to pay for the season, as I got it free on prime.

Did some leave because of contract disputes? A bit jarring. But endlessly fascinating. Robert's character shows some real growth and depending, as does the Dowager's. Edith grows up a bit and Thomas remains a jerk, with only the memory of his tenderness toward the dying soldier to give me hope for his change of heart. And Tom Branson has certainly emerged as a real three-dimensional character. So the season was good and I am looking forward to powering through Season Five in the next week or two.",1428019200,,647,4.586206896551724

My only criticism is the same on that falls to many same-cast drama series:  an event that is earth-shattering in one episode is barely hinted at during the next and forgotten history by the third.  This is most noticeable to me when it is a human relationship that seems to be healed in an improbably quick fashion after a catastrophic rift.

And however done, the character of the English valet Mr. Bates... aging, with a limp, and not terribly good-looking by most standards... came off as terrible sexy!  Whatever",1426809600,,496,4.744186046511628

You don't have to wait weeks for a story to come to a conclusion.  The characters are very real and though not always likeable, the viewer begins a relationship with them.

One of the things I liked the most about this season is that the more interesting stories focused on the staff rather than the family.  I've come to realize the staff have more interesting character arcs.  I enjoy what's going on down in the servants environment more than upstairs.  Still marveling at the impressive sets and costuming though.  For anone who has never gotten into watching Downton abbey, I highly recommend it.  It can seem rather overwhelming with so many characters to follow but that's part of its' charm.  The characters are very real and memorable and the relationships of these characters to each other will leave you wanting more.  Binge watch a season over a weekend sometime.

All of the character development and pace of the episodes are excellent, and we had a hard time waiting to see each new episode.  Some of the best moments were the snappy retorts traded between Isobel and Iris.  The ongoing love story between Mr Bates and Anna has been very moving.  We can't help ourselves, and sit spellbound as each new episode is viewed.  All the cast is superb.  Scenery and architecture is incredible.

The shows leave you wanting to see what happens next and waiting for the next episode.

The show begins in season 1 in the early 20th Century on the home estate of an English Earl. Although you could start with season 4, I would recommend you begin with season 1 and watch the family go through the years and decades.",1426636800,,595,4.238938053097345

5481555,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love period pieces and following how characters live and survive within the confines of rank, status and strict rules of conduct. Also, I love the romance and innocence of courtship. Things in present day have relaxed to the point of no boundaries whatsoever and r here's a serious lack of respect. Granted some of these boundaries needed to go such as in Jane Austen's world where if a young lady did not have a good enough dowry, she was destined not to marry well and genteel ladies did not work. So there was no hope of changing their situation. Alas, Mr. Darcys were far and few between. I have to agree with another reviewer in that a lot of the story lines in Downton Abbey season 4 were resolved with barely even a sentence or were not given any screen time at all. I also found myself going back to determine if I missed something. Some story lines came out of nowhere or were barely skimmed over. The writing is very lacking and disorganized. I love this world and many of the characters but the stories need to be better developed. Most importantly I will never forgive them for killing off Mathew twice. I loved Mathew and feel he was part of the glue that held Downton Abbey together. He survived season 2's season finale but not season 3's. I imagine by killing him off it allowed the opportunity for many more story lines as suitors stood in line for Mary, but it destroyed much more than it gained.",1426291200,,1416,4.45

My Taste tends to run more toward science-fiction & fantasy however I find a period film can gravitate toward that direction as well since it does not take place in modern life. So it's an alternate reality in its own right. Downton Abby is extremely well done! One really cares about the charectors and their lives, and the progression of the story. I have found the series quite addictive and am so so pleased that I can watch it through my TiVo as easily as any recorded program for free with my amazon prime membership!",1426291200,,552,4.53

5481598,5,B00AQVMZKQ,The historical research is obvious as Downton Abbey has developed characters who demonstrate the attitudes and customs of the day.  Viewers today might find some of the beliefs distasteful but progress has indeed taken place over the past 100 years.  It helps to have watched from Season 1 up to the present.  Having traced a sliver of mhy family back to Downton makes the show a connection with the past.  Looking forward to the next season along with millions of others.,1426118400,,472,4.790123456790123

There are a few stories that are less interesting but that's life and they still play a role in the future outcomes. Congratulations to Ms. Joanne Froggatt on her Grammy Award! Well deserved and certainly brought some new attention to this series. Maggie Smith is reason to watch the show alone even though her character isn't in view much of the time. When she is in the picture, pay attention & be prepared for some slashing lines delivered with wonderfully British zing that just might get by you!

5481874,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"All I can say is do not be fooled by some of the bad reviews. I agree that some scenes were there just for the purposes of being dramatic, such as Lord Crowley telling Bates to make sure Anna is lenient towards Edna. And also doesn't make sense Barrow is still in Downtown Abbey, and his character doesn't change. The first few episodes were disappointing with no Matthew Crawley. But eventually, the series does manage to pick itself up. Unlike some others, I thought the Anna and Mr. Bates plotline was pretty good. I am surprised that the show was still able to generate interest even after Matthew was gone. Matthew was the centerpiece of the show along with Mary. All of the actors are fantastic. Love the upstairs and downstairs division. Great show.",1425772800,,756,4.649253731343284

I even bought the DVD's for season 1-4 and will buy the rest as soon as they are available. While the editing can be a bit choppy you can catch on very fast what happened.

5481958,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It was exsquisite! Not the part about the sexual abuse. That was messed up. And how Edith had to give up her baby because people in the 20's were mean towards women who got pregnant by dudes that ran off and left. And how Rose and that cute band leader couldn't get together because they were two different races. I could never go in a time machine. I'd end up getting shot within a day after telling everyone off. I just want to see Mr. Bates kill someone, though. He's the only person on the show who's straight up gangsta.",1425340800,,525,4.26

Of course, the clothing reproductions are wonderful and the scenery.  I wondered if the well to do actually opened their mansions to house the wounded soldiers at that time.  I was also an avid fan of Upstairs Downstairs during the seventies--somewhat similar.

5482101,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I  am  amazed  how  the  writers  can  come  up  with  so  many  twists  of  the  plot.  While  this  is  basically  an  up-scale  soap  opera,  it  does  an  amazing  job  portraying  the  changing  nature  of  British  upper class  and  servant  interactions.  I  think  the  chasracters  are  authentic.  At  the  outset,  the  upper  class  existed  to  be  waited  on  and  ""dress for"" various  functions,  as  dinner.  This  series  documents how  the  ""system""  is  being  forced  to  change.  I  love  the  period cars.  The  dialogue  is  accurate  to  me.  The  characters  are  extremely  well-drawn.  By  the  way,  I  grew  up  in  a  city,  extremely  poor,  yet  I  (as  an  adult),  have  ""ridden  to  hounds"",  done  more  than  one  ""point-to point"", and  even  was priviledged  to be ""staff"",  who  worked  the  hounds,  and  ""field-master""  who  managed  the  spectator-riders on  a hunt.

5482453,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey is a well written show with a great cast. It shows you why we no longer have many aristocrat's.

5482461,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"What a great show! It's suspenseful, clever, and provides an interesting glimpse into the lives of a British noble family and their servants in the beginning of the 20th C. Everything is well re-enacted: the decors, the costumes, down to the way people spoke at the time, allowing you to 'travel' in time efficiently. I love watching time pieces for this reason, and DA makes it feel authentic. Yet, it's not just about history: the rise and fall of a family, the plotting and love intrigues are rooted in human nature and very modern for this reason. A must watch!",1424476800,,565,4.66

Was Paul Giamatti's courting of that waif in the season finale really necessary and integral to the Downton story? And how much longer will the Crawleys put up with Barrow's trouble-making shenanigans? The series really misses something without characters like Sybil and Matthew. Replacing the holes they leave with obnoxious tarts like Rose and Mary's harem of suitors isn't creating the same good feeling I used to get from watching this show.",1424390400,,560,5.233333333333333

I hope they will continue this for several more seasons.,1424131200,,353,4.0

The romance, the underhanded jostling for power, all of it is so much fun. Each of the many characters are so finely drawn, and well acted that you believe Downton really exists. Suspension of disbelief is complete. Season five is feeling a bit like a soap opera but this is a fine, fine dramatic effort.",1423612800,,416,4.4868421052631575

5482935,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I think Julian has run out of ideas! Thomas MUST get his comeuppance...please!! The Anna and Bates story is the SAME story just opposite roles. So absurd. Edith..what a train wreck she is. Since I have seen all of Season 5 on the Internet ( it has since been taken down) I will not be a spoiler....but Julian better come up with some good story lines for Season 6 ( which has been signed for) or Downton Abbey will be off my radar. I was very disappointed in Season 5. I think Dowton has jumped the shark as they say in Hollywood.,1422057600,,530,4.205882352941177

The actors don't seem to have the same energy and the camera shots aren't as good as the first four seasons. I definitely don't like the school teacher character and I doubt a person in her position would be so rude and obnoxious to people at formal settings or environments. She seems extremely out of place and rather ignorant. Most of the other characters are good actors and seem believable. I will purchase the 5th season, but mainly to have the entire collection.",1421625600,,597,4.695238095238095

5483189,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"Spoiler alert - don't read this review if you haven't seen the season.  I absolutely love this show, however, this season was lacking on so many levels I had to give it a two star review, although previous seasons were rated at 5 stars.  It felt like half the season was missing - many plot lines and characters introduced with no back story or resolution.  The most annoying aspect was that most of the significant plot lines were never actually shown, just discussed.  Mary is cleared by the solicitor to inherit - announcement made at dinner - this deserved at least one scene of that conversation.  Edith's man disappears, we only see her discussing her conversations with his office with no scenes of such.  She then  goes away for 8 months to Switzerland, we never see any of what would be compelling drama to create a backstory of what happens there for the next season.  Even more annoying is that this whole plot line is AGAIN resolved with a conversation.  Mr. Bates may or may not have committed a crime, which is again reduced to conversations.  Rose justifies a relationship with ""It will make Mummy mad!!"" - again we never see the conversation ending this relationship between the two characters involved.  I actually thought i had missed some episodes due to the gaps, but with no, there were only 9 episodes for the entire ""season.""  Television is to WATCH events, not watch them be discussed.",1420588800,,1409,4.706122448979592

5483388,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Just had to criticize a couple of details.
(1) In the court presentation scene, Cora and Rose should not have turned their backs on the king and queen after Rose executed the curtsies and the king chatted her up. Simple rule: it's rude to turn your back on the sovereign, it is not done! Even for a viewer unfamiliar with that rule, the moment when they turned their backs to walk away carried an odd sense of letdown. I'm surprised the director allowed it.
(2) In the ball scene, couldn't they have gotten extras who actually knew how to waltz? Those dancers with pumping arms and excessive bobbing were, well, not very impressive. It would also have been nice if the orchestra had played something more fashionable at the time, like the ""Merry Widow"" waltz (which would have still been conservative but reasonably modern), instead of an old warhorse.
Those quibbles aside, I loved this extravagant episode as much as everyone else did!",1420502400,,937,4.754601226993865

5483394,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"It would have got 5 stars, but the whole death at the end of season 3 really put a damper on this season. Some of the story lines this season are again exceptional, always a good rollercoaster of events. I had rewatched this season prior to 5 beginning and actually enjoyed it more the 2nd time; maybe because my husband wasn't making fun of me or pretending to die of boredom as I watched it again LOL.

Even though we saw the originals (which were stolen) these replacements are so truncated and chopped up we have trouble following the story. So PBS officials think Americans are too stupid to understand British inheritance rules. She speaks for herself. So Americans prefer a faster-paced story? Maybe, maybe not. In any case All the Americans I know (and I live here) would like to have a COMPLETE plot line. I hope no one else will waste the money on any disc that displays ""A warning about ""Downton Abbey"" discs. DO NOT buy any that say ""Masterpiece  Carnival  Original

We could almost not bare to watch anymore, but we did. And it is well worth it. As usual, it keeps you ever suspecting and enthralled-waiting for each new episode to see what's going to happen next or how the twisted tales unfold. We have really enjoyed the series, the sets, the actor/actresses-for the most part, and the storyline-for the most part (and we only say the negative for purely selfish reasons).

5484019,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Just binged-watched Season 4. I liked it, was captivated and just had to keep watching. That being said, I do not like ""Rose,"" the young cousin relative, her daffy grin and childish antics were not compelling and the story line with her and the black singer just seemed like pandering. Lady Cora has become boring and predictable. They need to shake it up with her, let some real emotion show through. I tired of her endless graciousness and sweet smiles. It's too bad one of the two sisters aren't more likable. Lady Mary is aloof and the other one is just devastatingly difficult to look at, let alone like. Losing Mathew was a blow to the show after Season 3 but I think the show handled his absence in Season 4 exceptionally well. The show is brilliantly done, what I hope is that as it goes forward that it doesn't lose itself in being politically correct by throwing at us every social injustice angle that every existed. I do not like Shirley McClain's character, nor did I like her brother and didn't care for the side story about him and a brief romantic possibility. I think at its core, the reason people like Downton Abbey so much is that many of the people are decent, just and ever so civil. They need to keep riding that theme and have less of some of the 'side characters' who are just superfluous and plain annoying.",1420070400,,1333,4.489711934156379

Of course I have been a Masterpiece fan since the first Upstairs/Downstairs from the 70's....some I have followed more ardently, some not at all.

I will be watching the entire series over and over. A must for anyone with a heart for love, and an appreciation of art at it's finest. It really brings that era to life for all classes of society. Like today, there is scandal, blackmailing, faithfulness, devotion, and determination. This family faces everything with an indomitable spirit, honor, integrity, honesty, modesty, and all the qualities demanded of royalty. Yea, Downton Abbey!",1419811200,,586,5.104166666666667

5484472,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Whenever a series of Downton Abbey ends it takes me days to stop thinking about them as if they were people in my own life.  This series is done with such class and depicts life in that era so well that for the first time in my life I understand how seriously people took one's station in life and how difficult it was to break out of it.  I understand English vs American and why we were such a shock to them.  I love the costumes and the structure of it.  I was even tempted to buy a handbook for the staff in a bookstore the other day just because I never realized how clearly depicted each job was.  It is made crystal clear when a butler is forced through circumstances to become a lowly footman and all the implications of that.  I find it very entertaining and educational.  I wait with anticipation for the next on whenever a series ends.  It is excellent!,1419120000,,864,4.225609756097561

5484481,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Although this season is full of really sad plot points, it still manages to be fun to watch. Everyone is having trouble moving on after Michael's accident, but Mary's mourning isn't keeping her from exploring her options. Edith's relationship with Michael takes some very interesting turns. Branson struggles to find his place in the world. The kitchen is full of drama, as is Anna and Bates' relationship. Rose is a fun, free-spirit who, much like Sybil, tests the Crowley's tolerance of people unlike themselves. And, as always, Violet is full of sass and one-liners. If you enjoyed the previous seasons, you'll most likely enjoy this one as well.",1419033600,,649,5.018518518518518

The setting is exquisite, lines are well-thought, performance is amazing, even just the view of the countryside and castle is great and really beautiful.
I do think the plot sometimes looks too-worked (with all the twists about anna and bates), but this is just drama and there's no need to be too realistic. And it still has moments that really warms your heart.
Watching without ads is a plus after enduring ads in hulu that interrupts every once in a while.

class distinction, but didn't know it went on in the Staff quarters!...Each series keeps you
guessing, very well acted, each actor is perfect for each part they play.  Those of us who
watch it regularly have to laugh at ourselves for getting so involve...you know, mad at one
person...sorry for the other,  almost crying with another...Oh what fun, watch if you want to

Mary is being wooed by multiple beaus, poor Edith continues to face a crisis of her own, Bramson continues to question whether he belongs at Downton Abbey, the crass American relatives have come and gone, and Rose's presentation at court was a glorious event with all the pageantry you could expect. The costumes and sets continue to astonish in their perfection, the older generation continues to resist all efforts to modernize Downton, and Violet (Maggie Smith) still gets the best lines :)

I recently re-watched the entire season in preparation for the 5th season which will commence in just a couple of weeks, so I wanted a refresher as to the major plot lines.

Getting Mary reluctantly back into the land of the living after Matthew's death by introducing 3 suitors and placing Edith on a rollercoaster ride with her swain in peril are just plain fun.  Anna and Mr. Bates are always an item of interest, and the entire downstairs staff's lives are developing to support the times that the commoners have more options, much to the dismay of Carson the Butler.

So just recently we decided to watch it on Amazon Prime, and within two weeks we had watched every single episode. Now we can't wait for the new season to begin on PBS. The casting is perfect, the setting is incredible, and so much more meaningful because it is a real place. There is a wonderful mixture of drama, tragedy and humor...it's pretty close to perfect in our house!",1418688000,,513,4.648351648351649

I recently started watching the 4th season presentation and realized that many scenes were missing from my copy of the series.  These scenes are important to the story line and it makes no since why they were not included on my disc.  I've never seen the first three seasons, but have the discs...but are they complete?  I don't know because I didn't watch the series when it was on PBS originally.  I hope PBS re-airs these seasons.",1418688000,,546,4.530612244897959

Some of the subject matter that arises is handled very well without being graphic.  Truly not suitable for younger children or pre-teen, they would be bored with it.

Julian Fellowes steers the story back to what made series 1 great - flawed characters trying to hide behind proprietary and class distinctions.

5484635,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"As much as we liked the first two seasons of ""Downtown"" (as we call it in our family) we always had to take the scripts with a grain of salt. Sometimes they got sloppy, sometimes plot arcs were stretched too for. However, most of the actors are so very good and the plots so fun that we completely enjoyed this silly piece of soap opera fluff. We gave the first two seasons 5 stars without reservation.

In the 3d and 4th season, however, the writers have found a way to make their bad habits more pronounced. The same faults are there (plot holes, gratuitous character inconsistency, ridiculous plot devices), but now they're really annoying. We still enjoy most of the shows (measured not by count, but by elapsed time). Some of the plot holes have gotten big enough to swallow the interstate highway system.

The first 3 and a half episodes of season 4 started out poor and got progressively worse. Fortunately things started improving and it pulled out of the tail spin. They finished up almost to the level of the first two seasons. Still complete fluff, but a lot of fun.",1418515200,,1077,4.575129533678757

His presence lends itself to the conclusion that everyone in the house is utterly stupid. Why not have someone discover that he shot himself in the hand, he took the dog and continues to undermine everyone. Send him away! Could make for an excellent episode and maybe even bring back some viewers who have left the show behind due to the dullness of his repetitive actions.

5484886,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"They ruined Downton with Anna being attacked. Can't trust these writers since they made one of the only safe, family shows there was inappropriate by including the usual, tired sexual assault theme. We don't NEED to see more of this crap to understand that it exists. We already KNOW it does since it is always in the news. We don't need to see it on Downton too. Also, they are just rehashing earlier themes. I thought Thomas had grown up some! Mary is going back and forth with suitors AGAIN. Imagination people!

5484922,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This season felt a little more soap opera-y than past seasons- but I think some of that is due to the sheer number of characters and storylines that have developed since the comparatively simpler early seasons- and now having less time to tell each story. But that said it became deeply engaging and quite easily something I did a bit of binge-watching with. It is a great series. I look forward to next season... am hoping they narrow the scope a little as it felt at times that I was getting footnotes of each story rather than in depth storytelling- just because there is less time per character.,1417651200,,599,4.555555555555555

Their deaths were so startlingly that you could almost tell that their contract was up and they chose to go.....however, the drama at Downton remains and watching them continue to live their lives is realistic and a strong plot line in itself. The suitors are lining up to pursue Mary all over again and with introduction of some new cast members more issues about class and life changing to the times continue with a new fervor. Also, there is some fun cameos of the royal prince himself, that really highlights how the upper class or ""monarchists"" view their role.",1416873600,,685,4.669421487603306

I had a hard time watching one episode because it involved violence against one of my favorite characters.  I finally slogged through this and was rewarded with the usual Julian Fellows magic.  His writing is invariably interesting and the depth of the characters is what  makes Downton so unforgettable.  Three cheers that the story line, although set up to continue, doesn't leave us hanging on important threads at seasons end. I am looking forward to season 5.",1416787200,,541,4.9010989010989015

The story line holds interest with the twists and turns of the family as it struggles to move into the  new century and the ways of the world it has moved into.  The struggle between the new generation and those past is only amplified by the struggle to keep the blinders on/not to change.  It happens in neighborhoods, small towns struggling to stay alive by new challenges, all while attempting to cling to values that have brought persons to the point of the day.  ""Ever ancient, ever new"" might be the phrase that fits this season.  Look forward to moving forward with the next edition!!",1416355200,,642,4.587719298245614

The continuity of characters suffers in this chapter of the series.

I like period stuff and the story, the sets and attention to details are terrific. My only complaint about the series is that they push the timeline much too quickly. They could have spent at least a couple of years(seasons) on each time frame before moving on to the next. The series could have lasted a couple of decades if they had slowed it down, but at the rate they are going, they will be in 2015 and still looking like they did in 1914!",1416268800,,555,4.148148148148148

5485606,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Julian Fellowes has accomplished something difficult: he's created a truly sympathetic landed clan of English nobility that, though flawed and privileged, aren't blind or intractable. Fellowes manages to portray the real warmth and affection between the kindly Crawleys and the staff that serves them - without avoiding the hostilities that arise among the working class.

This fourth season finds Cora and Robert Crawley stepping back to give their surviving daughters room to grow. Mary must strike out on behalf of her son, George. Edith finds herself yet again unlucky in love when her editor and suitor has gone missing in Munich. And Edith also must cope with an enormous difficulty that will change her life forever.
downstairs, the staff tries to hide the brutal rape of one of its ranks.",1415059200,,796,5.123076923076923

5485623,5,B00AQVMZKQ,What a wonderful show about the early 1900's England; the struggles of a prominent family during and after WW1 proves how quickly life at that time had to evolve and adapt to survive and keep their estate intact. The dramatic and scandalous story lines within the family and staff will keep you quite entertained.,1415059200,,313,4.814814814814815
5485624,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Every season of Downton Abbey has its special delights, and Season 4 is no exception.  The younger set characters march excitedly into a new post-WWI Britain world, one where many traditions treasured by Downton's elder generations suddenly mean little or are discarded altogether.  The facial expressions and genteel but emotionally charged outrage of Lady Violet Grantham and her son Lord Grantham's make these episodes thoroughly entertaining and instructive all by themselves.  Luckily there's much more to enjoy too.  I can't wait for the next new set of episodes, and I'm likely to binge-watch all four preceding seasons beforehand as a warm-up.  That's how wonderful I think everything about this series is!",1415059200,,714,5.396396396396397

5485738,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is a great show. It's full of wonderful performances and it's really a show about the small things. Does a great job of humanizing an aristocracy that feels very foreign to much of its audience. Possibly a bit of a guilty pleasure, but at least it's one you can share with nearly anyone.",1414454400,,301,4.490909090909091
5485739,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"This season is a bit of a disappointment. I've watched the first two episodes and find them somewhat lackluster.

5485752,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Breasts are downplayed in this series from every costume and camera angle and actress portrayal -- no one leads with their breasts; an anomaly in 2014 culture and media.  The tea is HOT in every scene.  This is the show of the thousand cups of tea.  Watch the steam curl and rise from the cup lips. The success of this series proves the maxim to writers, ""tell a better story."" How else could, in our age of saturation on television with sex and murder and shock value from ""reality tv"" to American crime series like Law & Order SVU starring drop dead gorgeous model-worthy detectives with form fitting shirts boasting their wares in our age where women's bodies are defined by JLo booty, ""Brazilian Butt Lifts"" and the oversized bosom of ""Big Ang"" of ""Mob Wives"" -- it's astonishing the U.S. is so enthralled by Downton Abbey's flat-chested flat-bottomed girl-bodied female characters who kiss their men with closed lips, and keep us nonetheless wanting to watch more.

Narrative fortitude decimates the PR drive need of the shock value hooks of American tv.

The main character is the Abbey itself and all that goes on within and around it for generations.  The story begins on the day the world learns about the sinking of the Titanic; an apt metaphor for the eventual inability of dukes and earls to support their palatial lives.

The pacing and music composition is calm and serene. Plots weave like a long game of chess. The editing is patient and calm, always intercutting back to far shots of the Abbey to remind us that it is the main character.  Close-ups of architectural and houseware details underscore this fact, as do back shots of characters; the movement of the dog, the ringing of a servant bell, the dusting of a crystal on a chandelier, the paintings that frame the characters, the fringe of the canopy of the Earl's bed.

The magic lies in the story, the plot, the interaction of characters.  And we can't get enough of a great story.  Not now, not ever.

The acting is flawless. America's greatest actors take part; Shirley MacLaine and Paul Giamatti.  As does Britain's greatest: Maggie Smith.

My favorite character?  Daisy, by far.

forever,
Annie

And what I've experienced is getting better writing & performances from lead characters each week. I have regretted the seeming interminable grief in Lady Mary, been surprised by how it seemed Matthew's mother was moving on ""faster,"" until her facade is cracked & shocked by actions and consequences weighing heavy upon staff & labor downstairs. I'd say I'm getting what I'd expected post seasons 1 - 3, but in early episodes it dragged as if I wouldn't! Still a pleasant drama & nothing herein spoils a thing for yet-to-view fans.",1414368000,,647,4.828828828828829

I would rank this season with the first season in terms of storylines and cast introduction, as there are several new cast members this season.

Other people such as Mary and Mathew are little bit stiff, and always with one face. Some episode was far stretched.

The show has a few rough patches, and you don't always like what's happening, but it's always interesting. This season had us seeing Anna in some new lights, and the actor was stretched in some new ways. She had always been likable and one of the best people in the series, this season she is forced through some troubled times. I like the fact that this series gives full play to both the peerage and the servants, and it helps us to understand the full context of their world. The timeframe of much social change is quite interesting, and multiple issues are handled pretty skillfully. I am glad we watched the series, and look forward to the upcoming season.",1413676800,,763,4.576642335766423

I felt assaulted but the way that they threw Mathew's death at us in the 60 seconds of the film. I thought I would give them a second chance though, and regretted it. The plot is so soap opera, the caricatures are indeed becoming caricatures, and I am very angry about the rape of Anna. I am done with Downton.",1413504000,2,480,4.172043010752688

5486035,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Love the show as always. So glad O'Brien left. I mean, she nearly killed her lady out of spite, did have her lose a child & got away with her bad behavior as always. Couldn't stand her or Barrow. Wish a piano or something would fall on him & crush him. Really, who acts like that? What does he need all that scheming for? Was hoping he'd die in America & never come back. Why do the downstairs management so to speak never tell the family of a person's bad behavior so they get fired or at least won't get hired back? Barrow was gone, but they brought him back knowing he'd make everyone's life a misery. The brief lady's maid should never have been brought back, she was obviously a troublemaker. Am glad the horrible nanny is gone though, which Barrow did instigate for the wrong scheming reasons of course but she did turn out to be a bad person. I know everyone else likes the drama for the backstabbing, otherwise why would horrible shows like 'Housewives of....' & other shows like that stay on the air, but I don't & downgraded it a star because of that. In real life I'd think they'd like to keep a bit more harmony in their life as life can be difficult enough without backstabbing schemers. Lady Mary is certainly nice enough but really every man just pines for her. Is it just the money & her charm or as my husband put it 'does she have magical lady parts?' Feel sorry for Edith of course as she doesn't have 10 other suitors hanging around she could choose from, like her sister does. Felt horrible for Mrs. Bates, she was in the kitchen, she should have knifed her attacker; & then to just let it go? You know he's done that before & will do it again. I can see not wanting your husband to kill him & get the noose for it but Lady Mary could have gotten him fired right away, just like she was going to when she found out. Hope they can keep the Abbey going, can't wait to see season 5.",1413244800,,1900,4.222527472527473

5486071,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Although the series is permeated with echoes--sometimes more direct--from ""Upstairs/Downstairs,"" the production values are astounding.  What's also amazing to me are the actors, all of whom are first rate.  ""Series Rot"" is starting to creep in, however.  Inconsistencies, plot holes, repetition and double-reversals occur, but, just a guess, this happens with all series that start out with an unknown termination point.  Thomas' behavior is one of the most egregious.  In the beginning he intrigues against staff and family out of bitterness, then, through a great deal of effort by the writers, create a credible redemption.  But then he falls again with no explanation.  Perhaps the writers thought the audience liked an evil Thomas, or maybe they needed to have someone inside to wreak havoc and thought better to have an evil Thomas than to introduce another evil character (although there was a half-hearted attempt to do so).  Still, this is the season which sees some of the best writing ever involving Mary.  Also, watching the inconsistencies in Lord Crawley's character sometimes makes me wince.  Sometimes strong, sometimes whining, but increasingly petulant.  I realize the writers are trying to depict the descent of the peerage concomitant with the rise of the middle class, but at least give him some consistent dignity.  Strangely, though I feel that I should be cheering on this merging of the classes, I also find the story less compelling.  Crawley's opposite, Mr. Carson, thankfully and perhaps quixotically, remains consistent yet interesting.  For me, the butlers in both series are the most compelling characters.",1413072000,,1637,5.34375

It is so well-written and the actors are so good that one finds oneself drawn in and anxiously waiting for the next episode. That's how it was last winter, waiting for Sunday evening to roll around to see what was happening to Edith or Lady Cora or the downstairs staff.  As an added bonus, it has given me a glimpse of my mother's youth.  No, we are not descended from the gentry, she was a member of the downstairs staff in  great house in northern England during the early 19",1412899200,,626,4.408695652173913

5486222,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Amazon sent me my  copy of this January 2014--It still appears on another order!  (from Sept. 2013) Please remove it.  This was the weakest production of the series--I felt the tale of Downtown could not seem to get started--and only near the end appeared to get some forward movement in the family saga!  Looking for better things in the next set.  The characters seemed to have gotten away from the creator--and there was a struggle to get them functioning once more--time passing was handled by minor side incidents!

Tom is still in a state of flux, does he or does he not belong at Downtown, should he go to America?  A young attractive school teacher has been added into the mix...love interest for Tom?

He threatens to bring up her past.  Rose finally has her coming out, and with some antics about recovering a love letter written by the Prince regent, he shows up and dances the first dance with Rose..sure to be cause for hers to be the most talked about season!

Seemed to meander too much. They would build up a certain angle, then quickly dissipate it. On the plus side, they haven't needlessly killed off many characters this season, so that's a plus. Looking forward to Season 5 on BBC. Hope it picks up the storytelling a bit.",1411171200,,423,4.653333333333333

While as I look forward to ala carte tv,  those less fortunate will have few opportunities to enjoy the ""special"",extra fancy viewings.  Too bad this direction can also prevent that chance exposure to culture many might not choose to ala their carte. I hope the schools can remedy this in their curriculum.  Everything changes.

Several of the characters have life-changing events happen which push them to their breaking points, which is interesting from a character-study perspective. The other seasons have done that as well--but they've also advanced the plot more than Season Four has. I found it more than a little frustrating, but your mileage may vary--I know plenty of people who absolutely loved this season.",1410912000,,498,5.3164556962025316

The acting is extremely well done and so captivating and believable.  The script is so good and Mr. Fellowes has written a classic that should last through time.  All the actors carry their parts very well and I'm drawn totally into the story each time I see more episodes.  The costuming is gorgeous;  the Abby itself brings me joy just to look at it - so beautiful.  Recommended very highly for extremely intelligent, fascinating and entertaining television.

5486852,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"This program subtly, but clearly, promotes a liberal agenda. This is not at all surprising considering it comes from PBS - the 'taxpayer funded outlet that has become a left-leaning channel for the liberal viewpoint.' The program favors divorce, feminism, adultery, etc. The program also directly insults Catholics, presents a false view of charity, and subtly (or not so subtly) promotes immorality. It is basically liberal propaganda disguised as entertainment. The more episodes you watch, the more you take in the liberal message.

Well we watched 4 shows back to back til midnight. We were hooked. The story line is in a great era in the early 1900's and all the struggles that were then and to follow. Plus was nice seeing a low tech type show where the characters and story line had to suck you in. Speaking of characters, some you will love...some you will hate. Then the ones you hate will begin to grow on you and you start to like them or at least Love to hate them. We blew through all 4 seasons in a few weeks time.

With lengthy spacing, it would be longer before Season 4 was over. With back to back, I could satisfy my hunger of finding out what happens next. I am so happy that I have been able to see all the seasons on my Kindle. Now, I'm caught up and am looking forward to more. Julian Fellowes weaves a mesmerizing tale of changes in the world and society, growth of the characters I've come to love, just enough info for me to discern what happened on some dark scenarios - all with the backdrop of Downton and London.",1410307200,,625,4.387931034482759

Poor Mr. Bates, having to sit across the table from the criminal! I was shouting at the tv, ""stab him with the fork!""",1409788800,,257,4.48936170212766
5487137,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I do not have cable. I refuse to get cable. I haven't had it in 10 years as I was sick and tired of the ""least common denominator"" advertising and programming. My parents suggested I watch this series, so I put it on my watch list and there it sat for months. I had no intention of watching it anytime soon.

Then one night I was looking for something to watch...preferably something short that I wouldn't get sucked into very much. I started on season 1, episode 1. By the end of episode 1 I can fairly say I was hooked. I watched 2 episodes a night until I finished with season 4 just this past week. What a phenomenal series. Excellent acting and a generally interesting storyline.

Why are the Brits better at film than we are now? Because we have gotten away from the basics I believe. The box office hits require explosions and C. G. imagery (Expendables 2, Transformers.) Sometimes this makes for an excellent movie (Inception, Avatar.) But more often than not, it leaves me wanting. There can be no substitute for a great director, great acting, and a great story.",1409788800,,1072,4.492307692307692

5487163,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4 picks up 6 months after the shocking end to season 3 with Mary struggling to find her way and Anna suffering from a terrible crime. Season 4 was darker, and while the writing remains clever and witty, it seemed subsumed by  the more difficult plot elements. Additionally, the women seem weaker in this season. Rose is an annoying child; Lady Grantham seems terribly stupid, believing anything the servants tell her; and three suitors element with Mary had me rolling my eyes. I have simply never found her all that charming, and I can't understand why so many men are tripping over themselves for her. Overall, a bit of a disappointment, but I'm still looking forward to season 5!",1409788800,,689,4.741666666666666

But once I warmed up to it, season 4 had its own appeal. Lady Edith's story was much more prominent this season than in the past as she developed independence through a writing career. Events happen, people move on, and there are the usual ups and downs for the upstairs and downstairs folk at the Abbey. It's a good continuation of the series.",1409702400,,475,4.534883720930233

5487183,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have just watched episode 2 of season 4. I am fascinated by the fact that so much has changed yet so much remains the same, i.e. technological, economic and social change affects people very similarly whatever the period of history, at least since the Industrial Revolution (approx. 1770). It has been an idea somewhere in the back of my mind for a long time, but after reading ""Lost Illusions"" by Honore de Balzac, watching ""Downton Abbey"" and reading ""The Second Machine Age"" by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (the age of Artificial Intelligence), the vague thought has turned into a concrete block. It seems as if the human race is being forced to run on a treadmill towards something better. But the question is, what is better? I think I'm turning into a Luddite.
Of course, this brilliant drama is as perfect in every historical detail, every bugle bead, bucolic English countryside, and vocal accent as could be. All of the people who have worked so hard and with such intelligent and creative devotion to produce ""Downton Abbey"" deserve a standing ovation (and unimaginable wealth).

The DVD actually didn't work at all on her DVD player.
I was under the impression it was region 2 (UK edition), and that it would work in South Africa.

5487450,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4 maintains the drama, in spite of losing a very popular character from Season 3.  In fact, Lady Mary is given a number of suitors to occupy our attention.  And just when you thought Bates and Anna were becoming a boring couple ... well.  Most interesting, however, is how the series moves gradually through the early 20's and you find yourself a witness to the subtle changes taking place.  The women take on a more assertive role while the aristocracy must either change or die.  But for our characters, both upstairs and down, perhaps it often seems a bit too idyllic at times in spite of their ups and downs.  Why else do we find ourselves pining for those days when watching this series? And yet we know darn well we could never really handle the 20's were they to come again.",1408924800,,788,4.475524475524476

5487471,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey never disappoints. Whether killing off main characters when they're at the height of joy and revelry or simply making them just disappear with no explanation, Julian Fellowes has created one of  the best dramas ever to grace the television screen.  Things have taken a bit of turn this season with Lady Mary juggling pigs and suitors and Bates becoming a much more ominous figure. (Remember when you thought there was no way he could have had anything to do with his ex-wife's death?)  Rose has taken the place of Lady Sybil only much more capricious and liberal and Lady Mary and Sir Robert fight over how to manage Downton.  Altogether a great season, but much darker than previous  ones.",1408924800,,704,4.785123966942149

Wonderful story-telling, superbly acted, I have only three more episodes of season 4 left to watch and still 4 months away from season 5!

I stumbled on this show by accident in its first season and I've been a fan ever since.  Wonderful acting and a marvelous glimpse into the disintegration of the aristocracy.  The US Season airs about 4 months after the UK which I can't stand, but I look forward to the new series every year.  Only about 8-9 episodes per season varying from 1-2 hours.  Nice to see Elizabeth McGovern in a role that seems tailor made for her.  Maggie Smith has me in stitches EVERY episode as the Dowager Countess. The special appearance of Shirley MacLaine was also a treat.  Enjoyable television with always a little touch of the risque.",1408579200,,722,4.507692307692308

It's so nice to see a simpler time when technology was at the brink of discovery and the ""modern"" world was becoming all the rage. A time when the women were actually courted over months, even years time and much more effort was exerted in the pursuit... When to spend an evening with family by the fire chatting, playing cards or listening to music was truly quality time.

No vicarious violence, no pyrotechnics, no special effects - just one of those rare situations when a synergy forms between all of the elements - acting, setting, costumes, script and directing, to bring to life a drama about people and their daily challenges. Each member of the cast portrays their role with realism such that the audience cares about their daily lives. It's a story about people living in a time when England was transitioning into the early twentieth century and the how each individual regardless of class had to adapt to a new era.
I will be most saddened when this series ends... not for the loss of one central character but for each and every member of the cast who through their excellent acting brought to life their roles such that just living their lives, I became immersed and empathetic to their hopes and dreams.",1408579200,,1109,4.904255319148936

The story lines suffered, particularly with the inclusion of cousin Rose and Miss Bunting, the politically radical and scheming teacher who is trying to grip her talons into Tom Branson. The show continues, however, to still be the best thing on TV in my opinion, and based on pre-publicity, it sounds as though the upcoming season will get back on track with the high caliber of acting and storytelling.

5487774,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is one of my favorite series. The series shows mastery in its interweaving of stories concerning the lives from both the aristocrats and the servants. The character development is high as well as the hard work that goes behind the 'authenticity' of the historical period..the dress, the locations, culture and the 'language' of the characters.  Who would have guess that a 'bread and butter' note is an expected written thank you note by a guest for a hosted dinner (usually sent within a day of such an event). You are definitely transported to an earlier era, mostly gone. I hope this series goes on for years to come.",1408320000,,625,4.73394495412844

There are the usual incredible costumes, props and sets. Of course the Dowager Countess continues with her zingers.

The good news is no beloved major characters are killed off. The bad is a very disturbing sexual assault.

The season finale includes a great sub-plot involving the Princes of Wales, the future Duke of Windsor.

Like the earlier seasons, streaming on Amazon Prime allows portable access on multiple devices.",1408147200,,609,5.237113402061856

5488053,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"This season did pretty well, despite being a little bit rocky, as they tried to rewrite the story without Matthew (Dan Stevens). I didn't love the plots as much, and some of the new characters (and returning old ones) got on my nerves, but other things about this season were wonderful! Mrs. Hughes becomes more out spoken and viewers are exposed to a darker side of Mr. Bates that is quite intriguing. Maggie Smith's character has many wonderful one-liners, same as usual, which kept me entertained throughout. Mary goes through the mourning process and we see her emerge from it stronger, her sharp tongue in tact, and a desire to pursue new relationships as a means to preserving Downton for her son, George. Tom also dallies in new relationships as he struggles to determine where exactly he belongs. Forever banned from the country he loves, he continues to reside with the family of his beloved, deceased wife. He loves them, but doesn't feel that he truly belongs with them, and that as long as he stays, his chances of starting a new life (and maybe even finding a new love) are compromised. The women they paired him with were AWFUL. I thought them both to be whiny, annoying, and overbearing. Plus, all they do is try to make him feel guilty for living at Downton and enjoying his extended family. He already feels bad enough without needing their snide remarks. They just kicked him while he was down, and I hope the writers will not marry him off to such a girl! He deserves better. As always, it's all more drama and heartache for Edith. This season sees her making one poor decision after another, and suffering the consequences. The way the season ends, things are not set to look up for her in season five. In any case, it was a good edition to the series, and I can't wait for season five to start!",1407715200,,1815,4.570552147239264

5488106,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"BUYER BEWARE!!!  We bought this as a gift for our daughter.  Upon giving her this gift we began watching the series.  The production is outstanding but that doesn't get you very far if a disc is defective.  Half way through the 2nd disc we were unable to play the disc.  After first attempting to play the disc in a DVD player we then attempted to play it on a computer.  The computer reported that the disc was damaged.  When I attempted to return the disc, Amazon said we were a few days past the return window.  Bottom line:  Amazon left us high and dry.  My advice, avoid any purchases of DVD's on Amazon, they won't back up defective products.  Their return policy effectively forces you to have to watch the entire DVD series within a small window of time in order to vet the quality of the DVD's.  Absurd.",1407542400,,812,4.375838926174497

5488149,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Regardless of the horrible ending to Season 3, from which I eventually recovered, I still really like the story of Downton Abbey and all of its denizens.  I continue to be enthralled by the scenery and costumes, but am becoming a bit disinterested in the lives of some of the characters.  However, in my opinion the acting remains superb, and -- for the most part -- I enjoyed watching Season 4.

Okay; ""for the most part"", but not entirely.  I have to say that it really changed the dynamic of the show for me when Matthew went to that Great Law Firm in the sky, and then we had to watch Mary heal from her grief by first acting like her and Matthew's baby was a complete stranger to her, then by immersing herself in the estate's business exploits and fending off a stable of suitors while only being a mother in seemingly 30-second increments.  Her storyline wasn't a complete disaster, and I still love Lady Mary, but this was a bit hard to swallow...

... as was the constant angst displayed by Tom about being a part of Downton.  We get it... you're an urchin from Dublin (or wherever) who doesn't belong to the aristocracy so you're going to continue to make poor decisions regarding moderately attractive gold-digging women.  That's great.  Look... Tom is one of my favorites, so please don't ruin him by making him so WEAK and then attaching him to some weaselly broad.

Anna and Bates.  I'm not a big fan of these two anymore, but I thought the tragic event was kind of oddly written/handled.  Not badly done, but the resolution/Bates finally finding out was somewhat awkward.  And now we have the inevitable ""did Bates really do it??"" storyline.  For the record, I hope he did do it.

Cora still sounds and acts like Carole Channing.  It's maddening, and it sets my teeth on edge to listen to her.

Poor Edith... will she ever catch a break?  Sheesh.

The only unbearable part, to me, was Shirley Maclaine being brought back as Cora's artless, tactless, obnoxious, arrogant mother.  As though the character isn't already written to be an unlikeable woman, they had to cast the most annoying, no-talent, abrasive has-been to amp up the unlikeability to epic levels.  That's just my opinion -- I fast-forwarded through old Shirley's scenes, and will continue to do so as long as she's screeching around the set.

The remaining story lines were good.  Of course, there was some room for character growth here and there (hello, Thomas), and I hope that the show gets back on track with Season 5.  I think that what's needed is the same sense of a personal relationship between writer and characters that we saw in seasons 1-3.",1407456000,,2633,4.637149028077753

5488181,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey has proven to be one of the best written shows in many years. With deep characters, evolving storylines (in part to the time period of the story), and likeable actors/actresses it has created a crack-like desire to see the next episode as soon as one finishes.
HOWEVER, in the desire to drum up more viewers or to prevent the drama from becoming flat, the commonly referenced rape scene pushes it beyond what was necessary for the show. There are some pathos that need not be depicted as vividly. I love the ability to watch these shows without commercials but a warning should have been present besides the standard TV-14 warning.
I recognize that people don't want to have the story spoiled.  But a sexual abuse warning was needed for the manner in which they depicted the events of Season 4 Episode 3 was too much. Any person that has dealt with rape first hand or had a loved one live through this trauma knows this impact. I am not advocating the removal of serious, deep life issues in television for more mature audiences. I do believe that more tact and discretion should have been taken for this specific conflict.",1407369600,5,1137,4.656716417910448

She enjoyed it so much that she stayed up until 2:00 a.m. in order to finish the story.  She continued on with other seasons during the following days.  She reacted to Matthew's death as if a friend had passed suddenly.  I enjoy presentation such as this that absorb the viewer into the plot.

5488310,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have watched every episode of Downton up until number 4 of season 4 and this is where I call it quits. The decrease in quality has become glaringly apparent. I'm not talking about the acting, or the sets, or the cinematography--they are all excellent. Rather, it is the writing that has gone downhill. Basically the writing has devolved to make it more of a high-brow soap opera than the high quality dramatic production it was in the first season, and somewhat in the second and third seasons. By this I mean that, at its best, the plot proceeded in a natural, believable, and yet dramatic way as a result of the personalities of the characters and the times they were living in. But now it seems as if there is one ""dramatic"" bombshell after another, dropped just to keep things exciting or suspenseful. But these faux dramatic events are not only highly improbable but now the characters are bending out of shape to fit the extreme twists and turns of the plot, to the extent that the characters are actually out of character. I'm so sorry to have to stop watching, I was really hooked on DA, but I would rather preserve my fond memories of how good the production was at its best than continue to be disappointed by the devolution of the writing. UPDATE AS OF AUG 14, 2014: All right, I admit I am powerless to resist Downton Abbey. I returned to the show because I missed the characters and the acting and the great dialogue Julian Fellowes puts in the mouth of Maggie Smith. Now that I've watched two or three more episodes, I'm glad I came back; there are some very good moments and the plot hasn't entirely devolved into soap opera drama.",1407196800,,1648,4.51505016722408

5488343,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Yet another season of exceptional and engaging television.  Would that more programs were as well written and performed.  Sadly, there are few of those and, as such, Downtown Abbey stands out as an example of what television can and, to my mind, should be.  It is a diamond amidst far too many lumps of coal.  The writing is intelligent and yet empathetic to the human situation.  And, I would have great difficulty finding fault with the cast.  They are well chosen and quite masterful at their art.  Every episode challenges my mind, tickles my sense of humor and touches my heart to the point of tears.  Those sometimes from sadness but, more often, from joy.  This is not just entertainment; it is an experience.  And a quite wonderful one at that!",1407110400,,752,4.67175572519084

The story hinges around the lives of an English aristocratic family. It starts just prior to the First World War and shows the family slowly adjusting to the changing times. Its interesting to watch the cook adjust to the introduction of electrical appliances!

The economic fortunes of the family change with the times, Younger generations get involved in the management of the estate with ""revolutionary"" new ideas. Understandably there is tragedy and individual family member problems, all of which keep you stuck to your TV screen watching as the drama unfolds. This is a REALLY good story to get your hands on.

Love them or dislike them, these are characters you can care about.  My only complaint is the shakey camera used to film.  It's all over the place-- very jerky.  It has been this way for past seasons too--it's as if a shakey Dowager Countess was holding the camera as it's being filmed.  Still, a very enjoyable watch.",1406764800,,446,4.666666666666667

5488616,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm not interested much in TV series; but I must tell you this one has really grabbed my devoted attachment. The locations are terrific; the storyline is accurate to the times and conditions; but most of all, the characters are excellent, excellently cast with exceptional actors and actresses, and one cannot help but become a part of the family of the whole troop. You can believe me, while the surroundings are authentic and actual, I'd find myself in the kitchen raiding the goodies, or butting thoughts with the butler, or falling in love with one of the girls,. This serious drama of life in a beautiful mansion, along with all of the problems of finance and family dignity the family heads must deal with; this series contains the most worrisome drama at times, and most humorous happenings at other times, and one cannot help but feel he is a part of the life of all. This is an excellent family entertainment package, and once you start watching, you will find yourself wanting more and missing the folks when it's between seasons - and if you have a passport and the funds, well, you'll be wanting to get there yourself. If I were an actor, and they were to call me, I'd jump a the chance without pay just to get to know the other actors who most delightfully play their character roles.",1406678400,,1297,4.594827586206897

5488660,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"So Season 4 for me wasn't quite up to snuff. Spoilers coming!! I hated the whole rape thing with Anna Bates. Good grief, let this couple alone, Julian Fellowes! First you throw Bates in prison for most of Season 3, then you have this whole rape thing hanging over their heads. I'm sure stuff like that happened to the staff as it does to women everywhere from all times, but why did it have to be Anna? I'd have been happy to have none of it. My other pet peeve is the fast transformation of Lady Mary from somber, grieving widow to juggling several earnest suitors for her hand in marriage. None of whom are that interesting. The whole mess with Edith's baby and Michael missing is just that, a mess. At least no major characters died this season, although I held my breath when the Dowager Violet got sick. Loved having Cora's mother and brother on the show, sure hope Harold (Paul Giamatti) gets to hang around more in season 5. I still love this show despite its faults this season, and I'm looking forward to the debut of Season 5 on PBS January 4th, 2015.",1406678400,,1061,4.3908629441624365

5488687,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Not my favorite season, but how could it be with the viewers and storyline reeling from the loss of Matthew. Then throw in Anna's attack to the formula, and yes how could this be any fans' favorite season. I have tried hard to like Rose as much as the British royalty seems to but her character honestly annoys me and much of the season was about Rose. I am glad for Mary honestly expressing her grief for Matthew and for Matthew's Mom's very real expression of feelings (her conversation in the nursery with Mary and Branson was one of my favorite scenes). It is a ""transition"" season so that's why I can not particularly like it but still give it five stars because I anxiously await discovering what the story will transition to in season five.",1406592000,,747,4.5

5489014,5,B00AQVMZKQ,A lot of people have said that they thought season 4 was somewhat lackluster with regard to the various stories that evolved during season 4. I thought it was really well done as far as the writing was concerned. Would I say that this was on par with season 2 during the turbulent WW1 years ? No. It was extremely well done though and it was nice to see some different and suprising behavior from some of the cast regulars. I ordered this season through Amazon instant video service and streamed it through my set-top device. Admittedly I watched the whole season from start to finish in one sitting because it was that good. Different from previous seasons? Yes! Did it hold its own with interesting and developing story lines? Oh yah. Downton Abbey fans will no doubt be happy with it and there might ven be a cliffhanger or two to warm ya' up for season 5 reported to be coming to us in the U.S. in early January 2015. I can hardly wait.,1406332800,,940,4.377142857142857

Since she is so into this show I asked her if she thought she might want to live in that time in that way.  Her reply - ""Oh, no.  I need my blow dryer...""  Go figure.

5489249,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"They have done it again, another great season of Downton Abbey! I truly hope for a season 5. They have again done a wonderful job on the sets and costumes etc. The only thing lacking is that they seem to forget to delve into all of the characters, they seem to just give us a taste of who they truly are and then send them off to the side to focus on one character. I wish they would expose more of all the characters inner thoughts and feelings. This season seemed to focus mostly on Mary trying to find her way in life after becoming a widow, but what about Tom they barely touched on him. We got more of a view of the personalities of the people downstairs that upstairs, it would be wonderful if we could get a good inside look into all the characters. It would be wonderful to find out more about Lady Edith and who she really is and how she really feels. She seems to always be told what to do then disappears into the shadows. Hopefully that if there is a season five we will find out more about her and how she copes with her secret daughter.
Overall a great series and hope that season 5 gives us a little more insight. Please BBC don't just stop making the series the way you have in the past and leave faithful viewers hanging on and wanting more!",1406073600,,1258,4.159836065573771

Robert's a douche, Mary an Ice Queen, staff downstairs is a clown car, the Dowager a scene stealer (I mean that in the best way). If it wasn't for the lush set pieces and Maggie Smith, I'm guessing the legs would have fallen off this show two seasons ago. Too bad. I was a huge fan. Probably only so much you can do with a stuffy old upper crust family and the (increasingly good looking) staff that adds spice and high jinks but basically comes down to wash, rinse, repeat.",1405900800,2,547,4.269230769230769

5489475,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Note: The extras on the DVD were good behind-the-scenes items, but I would have also liked the after-show presentations they had on PBS.  I was really looking forward to those, and that's the only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5.)

WHEW! a lot happened in Season 4, didn't it?!? (As far as I can tell, those who said there was no character development hadn't watched past the first couple of shows.)

SPOILERS (as I address others' comments)

-- Regarding Edna, and why `clueless Cora' hired her:  first, obnoxious Rose stepped in (AGAIN) where she was not invited.  And remember, in Season 3  Edna was the clean-up-committee.  She was rarely in a room with the family and she was at Downtown a very brief time.  That's why Cora only vaguely remembered her, which is believable.

-- Someone mentioned they don't know where the Edith's baby storyline came from.  It came from the episode where she spent the night with Michael just before he left for Germany.  There, he was set upon by some of Hitler's ""brown shirts"" and even his newspaper isn't sure what's happened to him.  We watched Edith grow stronger as she makes company decisions for Michael (using her power-of-attorney privileges) and she does all of this while working through a way to hide her pregnancy (Aunt Rosamund to the rescue).  Good to have a show go the adoption route rather than abortion.  Nice touch.

-- I DO hope Rose isn't a big factor in Season 5.  O'Brien, Thomas, and Rose are the ""Barney Fife"" characters in this series, for me.  They become tedious to watch and you wish they'd just go away (which, thankfully, O'Brien did).  Newsflash to Julien, BBC, PBS, etc.:  the younger crowd was watching Downton before you added an obnoxious teenager.  If you keep Rose, could you please make her grow up q-u-i-c-k-l-y and keep the sweet parts of her character?  Othewise, she tiring.

-- To a totally different ... and tragic ... topic, they would have lost me if they hadn't come to a fulfilling conclusion after the rape.  An American production would have dragged that on a couple of years.  Dragging in on for a couple of episodes was bad enough.  Once John knew what was going on, we all could relax a bit (instead of the constant ""Tell him!"" tension.)

-- EXCELLENT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN SEASON 4.
Joseph Molesley (we discover his first name) becomes much stronger, and Cora's new lady's maid - Miss Baxter - finally tells off Thomas.  I hope they continue the Molesley/Baxter storyline, because they deserve each other in a nice way :->.  Edith is heading to Germany, which has me a little nervous.  ""Levinson"" is often from a German/Jewish background.  Not sure if that's going to play a part in Edith's safety, going into a bad situation. Do any historians out there know when the Nazis began looking to the nth degree on ancestry for an excuse to kill people?  If Edith stays, she may be in danger.

-- Excited for Alfred as he finally makes it to underchef at the Ritz.  His dream-come-true is on its way.  Will he send for Daisy after all (as he once did for Ivy), or will she take up her former father-in-law's offer to take a place at his farm (her inheritance)?  The Daisy/Ivy loggerhead was nicely solved with Ivy heading to America with the Levinsons.  Hoping we'll see more of the Harold/Madeleine relationship.  Julian  left it open.

-- Good Mrs. Patmore/Daisy moments throughout the season, which were nice to see.  We discover Carson's long-lost-love.  Julian has given us an impossible choice when it comes to Mary's suitors.  All three are good candidates, but I'm rooting for Tony :->.  I'm hoping his honesty about Charles - when it was to Tony's detriment - gives him some extra points - ha!",1405814400,,3703,4.683229813664596

5489689,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Season started slowly. Camera work and story lines seemed a bit more on the casual side. Thought there was that period piece formality missing.

5489690,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Could not wait to be able to watch this  4th season and I found this season as good as the previous three. Wishing there was more than 9 episodes for this season but each was well done and I enjoy this family so much. The characters are so heart warming.,1405468800,,254,4.08

So now we are caught up with the rest of the world.  Season 4 was captivating.  There are so many stories within the story going on.  We love Maggie Smith! She is the perfect Dowager Countess! We love the intrigue and the humor.  Funny and sad all at once.

5489735,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Tragedy, intrigue, romance, scandal, and the old lord clearly stating he is a monarchist while defending his social class.  Great gravy, this was a good season.  Granny is better than ever.  We are watching her age and move closer to the end, and this actress remains the creme de la creme of the show.  Her patience with so many people beneath her social class clamoring to give her attention and a turn around the ballroom is amazing. Mary's class consciousness makes me want to send her to the House of Lords, but oh not in her day.  It is hard to believe that Robert and Cora would overlook the moody illegitimate pregnancy of one of their daughters.  They all hang out together too often to not miss her for four months and note that she couldn't care less about Swiss French.  Perhaps George will one day stumble over his half sister tending a pig pen, and look out for sparks and revelations.  The Irish Catholic chauffeur turned estate agent and adopted son in law does need to leave the house to make sense.  His love for the Crawleys seems to either be a calculated way to keep a higher status or a sad, insecure rejection of his own class values to keep his daughter in good favor with her mother's people.  Either way he needs to go to America or marry the school teacher and live in the village.  I am tired of the gay guy being the bad guy, and it would be nice if he met a railroad employee and ran off to find love, but no chance?  Cora is nice, but her people are awful. I am an American and I hate the intrusion of her relatives into this period piece fantasy.  It does highlight the tragedy of the aristocracy at the mercy of market capitalism and populist politics in the 20thc.  Ah well, banking, finance, diplomacy and maybe non-profit management are open to employ them.  Which man will win Lady Mary's hand in the next season?  Will Granny leave the show by God's hand? Will the little bastard be discovered and taken into the big house (unlikely, but they did take in the Irish Sinn Fein chauffeur)?",1405382400,,2024,4.415094339622642

i am soo getting tired of Thomas!!!  I think there are enough characters to allow drama without resorting to his machiavellian tactics. And what the writers chose to do to Anna!!! It  just did not make any sense. it was completely unnecessary.  But then again as some reviewers have said, this is really more a soap opera than anything else.
Also, I feel that Branson is taking a really long time to come into his own. He has become a shadow of himself.
The whole season 4 left me very unsatisfied, but for those who don't mind soap operas I guess DA is as good as ever.",1405296000,2,598,4.418181818181818

Also, missed some of the earlier characters ( I won't name them in case the reader doesn't know they will be disappearing from previous seasons) who had bite and/or were central.

5489931,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"What hasn't been said in praise of this series?  They have produced a series that teaches the huge shift in world economics and social change that took place a hundred years ago.  For many folks, it's just very entertaining, but the writers have managed to sneak in the very importance and essence of the intricate social changes that still effect us all today.

PBS did a special on Highclere Castle, the actual site of Downton Abbey.  It is still occupied by an Earl & his wife.  There is a butler, two chefs, a total staff of about twenty.  It is still surviving, but the annual costs run over a million pounds a year, and the Downton Abbey filming is a big help in that regard.  I found that show on another provider's menu - Netflocks, or something like that.  Highclere is also a popular tourist attraction, a few thousand acres are now dedicated to productive farming, and high end bird hunting is also a bread winner for the estate.

Probably like you, I hope the series continues on for many more seasons.  I love it when education can be so entertaining.",1405123200,,1064,4.523560209424084

5489946,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4 comes up quite short of previous three.  The creators find themselves searching for footing after the loss of two key characters, and end up spending the majority of the season setting up Season 5 and trying develop ""Rose""-the one dimensional cousin of the Crawleys and the most boring character at Downton-no avail.  Overall, I was just bored with Season 4.  Hopefully this was just them catching their breath,  and Season 5 will again show signs of life.

For perspective,  I would give the first three seasons five stars.",1405123200,2,533,4.866666666666666
5489947,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I loved Season 1 but I thought Season 4 was the best leaves so many avenues open for future story lines. Thought Paul Giamatti was excellent as Lady Grantham's brother Harry.

She is still the absolute star of this cast of bluebloods.  I was delighted to see that horrible lady's maid depart Downton, but regret she left her  evil-doing partner in crime behind the wreck havoc both upstairs and down.  Downton survives in spite of his lordship who seems unable to change with the times as the ladies of the house show amazing good judgment and character at every turn.

The characters' interactions are less contentious and not as well developed as in the past.  Even Violet seems to have lost her edge.  I still enjoyed the relationship between her and Isobel, though. I felt this season was totally a set-up for next season.  But I am really not much interested in what happens to the characters since the season ends with everyone happy and at peace.

5490078,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Well, even though I heard from two friends and previous fans that it was no longer worth watching, I have just watched the whole 4th season and loved it. The characters continue to develop and are faced with unpredictable situations. It is almost worth watching just for the costumes, which are great fun. I like all of the characters, even the bad ones. They are all sympathetic in their own way. I am so impressed with the writer and creator, Julian Fellowes who has basically turned out - 40 hours plus now of better entertainment than is available on television otherwise. I looked him up on IMDB and see that he proposed to his wife 20 minutes after he met her. He wrote romance novels in the 70's under the name of Rebecca Greville, and is a fan of the 2012 series Smash. I will have some fun checking those out while waiting for Season 5. Before closing, kudos to Maggie Smith for experimenting with body language and coming up with something new and fun when all words fail, which does not happen that often with her character.",1404950400,,1035,4.51063829787234

It's quite obvious they have put their all into their characters. The performances and story line are such that it draws you in to where you feel you are a part of their lives.

We're treated to a glimpse into the debut of a titled socialite at the same time we watch Daisy's personal triumphs and disasters unfold in the kitchen, and also witness Molesly's personal growth as he hiccups, stumbles, persists, then watches in stunned disbelief as he's relied on for advice and support.

Downton Abbey see how the upper class live and love and sometimes lose. You can also see how the downstairs employees live and love.  The characters are very real the actors who play those characters are top of the line.  MAGGIE SMITH is wonderful as the dowager countess. She has the spit and vinegar of someone out of their time, who just doesn't know it yet.  It's a great Masterpiece theater show.  See all four season.

5490273,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"I had a feeling that once Matthew was killed off I would lose interest. But I still planned to watch, hoping for another character like Matthew to materialize. Unfortunately, I could not get through episode 1 of season 4. I still do not understand why Thomas is still there after all that has happened. I am tired of the young kitchen assistant with nasty expressions and lack of growth as a character. I am not fond of Edith, and she seems to be the center of attention now. The dowager is almost too nice now. I liked her zing in previous seasons. I guess I need to realize that these long running shows can't be great forever. 3 seasons was what we got with this one.

Some parts area really good, the manipulating staff the sarcastic intelligent grandmother, they do draw things out a bit longer then they need however over all something good to watch on a rainy day.

Even tho the plotting is getting a little strained, I've grown to care about these people, Upstairs and Downstairs, and therefore I look forward to their continuing saga(s) with great anticipation.  I own the first four and suspect that I will own as many more as there are to come.  The acting is top-notch.  The production values are stunningly good.  The ""guest"" casting is always right on target.  God forgive me for saying this, but I think it might be time for Julian Fellows to seek more writing collaboration and get into some stronger story lines and more interesting character development.",1404691200,,645,4.916666666666667

5490337,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Writing a story line and script for films of continuing nature as Downton Abbey, has to be a  huge challenge. The many complexities of film making, besides just the script has to be daunting but Downton is holding up well in my opinion. The characters are holding my interest and I LOVE period films.  The current trend in movies/TV series is not to my liking, violence, crude language, poor quality editing, too much animation, ""reality"", etc,etc. At our house we no longer watch cable, don't have anything except internet connections....I am thrilled I can watch Downton on amazon with our ROKU, I love it.

5490374,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"DISCLAIMER- once this review went live I noticed it was for the ""original UK version"" and I get mine from netflix and doubt I had
that version, whatever is on that one.

I enjoyed this, but the reason I  watch is to chill and get carried into a well done period drama.  I don't expect stark reality- in fact that is what is refreshing about these episodes- they don't try to be ""raw"" and ""tough"" like so many hangdog hollywood series. I am happy to see things roll along.

I thought the central conceit of the series is people stuck in a bygone era, resisting change....well you can't fault season 4 for failing to represent that.  It doesn't really matter to me that nobody ages in ten years, or changes their personality, and the main way to ""move on"" is to die- I'm still chuffed to kick back and binge-watch the disc.

Some things I noticed and enjoyed w/ this series- There was more humor, and  amusing rapartee .... although at one point there seemed to be a directors decision to have Mary and Edith talk as though they were captive in an underwater aquarium, talking slooow and low and  watery, (doubtful this had anything to do with conveying humor)  this was fairly quickly redirected and they reverted back to somewhat more normal conversations in an episode or two.

 I also noticed and liked that there was more of a focus on interactions and dramas with the staff, with longer, detailed segments devoted to the dynamics with their relationships and the various situations that affect their lives.  There were even gardeners this time- one wonders where they have been the past ten years. So yes, I will look forward to Season 5, and whatever else....",1404604800,,1664,4.603389830508474
5490375,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"A show that shows the changing of the past, though slow are arduous for some.  Elegance for the rich and struggles for the poor, how strange that we are reverting to this horrible mainstay of the rich and the poor and no middle class.  Is this the future or shall it remain the past where it belongs.

Overall enriching and maddening at the same time.  Great to watch, but i could never live in the time.",1404604800,,404,4.276315789473684

5490478,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is a treasure.  In most series, the writers have changed by the third season and the characters seem to go down darker paths.  However, these characters are changing with the times, and though they may be conflicted, they are staying true to themselves.  Bravo!  As always, the costumes are exquisite, and scenes are stunning.  Please Mr. Fellows, lets give Lady Edith some happiness this year!  Don't you think she is a bit overdue?

I'm so glad that AMAZON PRIME has added the show to the Prime family of ""free"" viewing, at least for the first four Seasons of Downton Abbey.

I guess I'll have to wait and see when AMAZON will air SEASON 5 FOR FREE; Currently it is available, but for individual episode rental, or to buy the entire Season.

Spoilers follow...

This season deals with race, sexuality/abuse, woman's roles and a love triangle!  I watched it almost in one day. The same characters are back (except Matthew) with an inclusion of some new ones! The season starts off with one of my least liked characters, Ms. Obrian, quitting Downton and stealing off into the night.

5490642,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I have loved this saga of a family and have seen all of it more than once.  The BBC did it I assume and they do geat things.  I also appreciate that the DVDS in this case have subtitles which mots BBC drama has not had .,1404259200,,220,3.6595744680851063

5490644,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"not a great season for Downton Abbey.  Slow moving, no real drama.  This season was missing the high drama of previous seasons, no one died, no one killed anyone, the season finale seemed more like a final episode for the whole show.  If next season is anything like this one, I'll stop watching.  Plus, so sick and tired of Thomas' character, he's annoying!  The constant love triangles with the eldest daughter, also annoying.  Nothing worse than a woman who can't make up her mind and instead plays with people's feelings.  This season just missed the high notes of past seasons.",1404259200,,582,4.76
5490645,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I continue to enjoy the Downton Abbey series, although I questioned Julian Fellows thinking in allowing that aweful experience to occur with sweet Anna.

5490647,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Excellent series; if you've not watched it at all....do yourself a favor and watch one of older (if not the first) episodes.  Most who enjoy the overall theme, will no doubt devote some time watching the older episodes, eventually moving into the more recent.  I must admit to being hooked from the first episode.
I actully dread the season finale, as I know it will be a while before I can watch again.  Give this series a try, you'll love it. ",1404259200,,445,4.45679012345679

5490657,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm caught in this British Soap Opera -- pulling for this character, mad at another, hoping Bates won't get caught, etc.  I'm hooked.  The characters are from another age but there are the likable, distasteful, and down right mean people, all mixed up in severly rigid class distinctions and full of intrigues and counter schemes that make me want to watch the next episode.  The end of Season 3 was just horrible (a very nice chap died in a motor car accident) and I couldn't watch it for awhile.  But then I thought, 'That's the way life is unfair stuff happens to the good and the bad guys get away with bad stuff.  BUT I think it all evens out in the end, you reap what you sow!

5490662,5,B00AQVMZKQ,As always Downton Abbey never ceases to enthrall me.  I very much missed seeing Daniel Crawley but life goes on.  I love all the characters but the end of this season just left me wanting to see Mrs. Hughes bend Mr. Carson backward and lay a big ole smooch on his haughty lips!

It is  full of surprises and somehow  manages to come together at the end.  The plot and characters are always fully developed!

5490737,4,B00AQVMZKQ,I am a fan of the whole series and have watched all four seasons.  Season four was good but not great.

5490748,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"While I still love Downton Abbey, Season 4 is a little depressing, so many negative story lines. I have watched 3 sessions, and while I will continue watching I'm not as interested as in the past.",1404172800,,196,4.472222222222222

5490751,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm a huge Downton Abbey fan, and Season 4 did not fail to please. The first episode was the weakest of the season, but the quality of the storyline and acting soon rose to my expectations. I had read reviews of others who stated that they felt the characters began to act out-of-character, and were not impressed with the story lines. I disagree. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Season 4 - so much so, that I watched the entire season again and happily picked up on some nuances that I had missed the first time.",1404172800,,511,4.446808510638298

5490767,5,B00AQVMZKQ,We had to take a break from DA while it made it's way to Amazon Prime. My daughter and I stayed up way too late watching the first episode of this season. It was worth the wait!

5490787,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I thought with the surprise death of Mathew at the end of last season, this series was doomed for the trash bin, but the writers pulled Downton back into the spotlight! This show has everything... humor, mystery, love, murder, and I love the style and period! I just wish one did not have to wait so long in between seasons!! Every actor is chosen with obvious care to bring out the very best for each character down to the smallest parts....just wonderful!!!

5490791,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"While the series focus is aristocracy, it depicts snobbery in both camps in one form or another. What continually draws me back is how the series is actually telling the stories of growing up in this environment, making choices (some good, some bad), becoming aware the 'old' ways need to make way for the new and best of all, it shows how a family (and they ALL are a family) supports each other through their crises.  A fine example of life and how waxes and wanes through the cultures with a few twists of wanting to throttle some of the characters for their insecurities and joy when some receive a well-deserved comeuppance with a large dose of inclusion even if you weren't born into it - aristocracy.  Good all around show!!",1404172800,,731,4.572519083969466

5490797,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Love the ""period"" everything.  The main story and the sub plots are fun to watch and try to figure out.  My two favorite characters are Lady Mary and the Butler.  Mary because she is so confused.  Does she maintain the fake vainer of aristocracy or give in to the new changes in society which she obviously wants to do yet is constrained by her feeling of responsibility to the family and England.  Mr. Crowley, well he is just the epitome of the ""Rock of Gibraltar"".  Wants to maintain the status quo but can withstand the tide of change no matter his reluctance to change.",1404086400,,574,4.471153846153846

5490803,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The best show on TV or anywhere else!  Everything about it is excellent, and I always look forward to seeing it again and again.  Hope there will be another for many years to come.  The first season I saw every episode at least 5 times before the next one began, and then I watched it from beginning to end.

5490828,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I wouldn't even know where to begin when it comes to assessing this series. Let's just say that it will be remembered as a classic when it comes time to do such things. From fantastic set design, to characterization and plot, it is very easy to get sweep up in the storyline. It's easy to forget that even the ""rich"" have problems and challenges. I'm glad I have been able to come along for the ride.",1404086400,,400,4.276315789473684

5490846,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Last season got too tragic for me. Two sudden deaths of major characters were just too much. This time around had its tragedies; A rape, a bastard, someone possibly murdered (but he was a bad guy), for all that it was a more positive season. Overall it was a fascinating story, and I was drawn in to the lives of both the servants and masters, and those somewhat between, as always.",1404086400,,382,4.394366197183099

5490852,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is so engaging and enthralling and just keeps getting better and better.  I love the way it engages what i believe to be the actual unfolding of the 20th century, not only in that culture, but how the North American culture was at the same time and the actual ties that bind.  I remain enamored with the personal discipline of the Lords and Lady's and feel that those same values have never gone out of date or style.  Therefore, I love seeing it emulated as a reminder to me of the discipline of holding to my own values.",1404086400,,536,4.34
5490853,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Love the show!!!!,1404086400,,17,5.0

5490856,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The characters are extremely intriguing. The storylines of the aristocrats, as well as the help leave you wanting more of this popular show. The costumes were fantastic, the actors are believable, I just can't get enough of this show!",1404086400,,234,5.0256410256410255
5490857,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I can't say much about this season without giving some spoilers, but I have to say I'm disappointed in what has happened.  The series is still one of my favorites to watch, but I'm curious as to how they are going to do the storyline now...guess I have to watch to find out :)

So, I watched the whole season and they did well.  Still curious where it's all going.....",1404086400,,368,4.228571428571429

5490862,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"this series is just to interesting and enjoyable to not watch it.  They get a bit bogged down on occasion but it has proven to be a delight to wait for the next series and watch each week, They have rediscovered how to do a program without fowl language and everyone having the need to share their bedroom activities .  I do hope they continue issuing  this tasteful series.",1404000000,,374,4.391304347826087
5490863,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Amazing! It was well worth the wait. The plot was as intriguing as it was in the first three seasons with a few surprises thrown in for good measure. I have been in love with Downton Abbey from the beginning and I am anticipating many more.,1404000000,,240,4.239130434782608

5490869,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This season has some suspense leaving the viewer just wondering what will happen next in many situations & the plot deepens with several characters. I like how the curveballs were kept to a minimum & characters didn't just disappear like in the previous season.,1404000000,,261,4.954545454545454

I'm done with seeing bad things happen.  It is too much drama.  I loved Lark Rise to Candleford much much better.  Some characters are consistently good -- that is the Dowager - Granny, and Mr. Carson, and Mrs. Hughes.",1404000000,4,372,4.492537313432836

5490890,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm so sorry the story involving Anna and John Bates was so far below the usual high quality of writing I've come to expect from Downton. Anna wouldn't control how she so cruelly treated him and then ask him later not to jeopardize what they had built together- seriously? It made Bates look like a fool and Anna a selfish victim, even though she says it was to protect him from going to prison. Even considering the mindset of the times,the fact that she gave him no more credit than to, herself, jeopardize what they built, made the entire storyline at the very least, insulting. The rest of the season is a good story line, but what a shame that Ross was such an unmelodious singer.",1404000000,3,685,4.444444444444445
5490891,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Excellent!,1404000000,,10,10.0
5490892,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey is one of the best period dramas to come along in a great while and the writing is among the best.  Maggie Smith delivers the best lines with such great aplomb and they are worth quoting and repeating.  Even after watching it on PBS there is so much more to it that having the series on DVD to watch and review a time or two is worth it.  Upstairs / Downstairs was an excellent period drama during its time but D.A. outshines even that great series.,1404000000,,463,4.238636363636363

I did not notice a part which showed a bit of what had gone on in the previous 3 series (just to bring me up to date).
That would have been nice since it had been a couple of months since I'd completed the 3rd series.",1404000000,,337,3.898550724637681

5490936,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I came into watching Downton Abbey a few seasons late but quickly caught up and am now anxiously awaiting Season #5. I am rewatching Season #4 because it was superb acting, sublime writing and refreshingly delightful. The lines that often were spoken have been written and passed along as quotes to ponder and use. The scenery is breathtaking, the characters are well developed and the interactions and relationships between the haves upstairs and the have not so much downstairs are believable but not so predictable. Well done. Bravo PBS!",1403913600,,540,5.078651685393258

5490948,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Interesting that Mary actually got down and dirty.  That was refreshing.  Wasn't too surprised about Edith. DO NOT LIKE ROSE.  I think she is taking away from the show.  Story line is not realistic in my opinion.,1403913600,,212,4.648648648648648

I wonder if the series continues onto the economical global depressed 1930's just to see how the Crowleys deal with an even more changing erra of a pre WW II Europe.",1403913600,,448,4.409638554216867

One of the joys of getting older is that I don't remember real well, so it was like watching it for the first time. After watching the series I feel like I know the characters and begin to feel like they are my family.",1403913600,,298,3.95

5490960,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I never tire of watching Downton Abbey. The costumes & settings are beautiful & lush. It's an accurate reminder of what life was like in the early 1920's between the gentry & those who served then. Since there really is a ""Downton Abbey"", known today as Highclere Castle & where much of the series is actually filmed, it's a good idea to do a little research on Highclere. There is plenty of information available & it will enhance your viewing of the series & give you an idea that life back then is portraied as it was actually lived. I choose to wait until an entire season is ready to watch at once. I finished season 4 in four days and it was very much worth the wait.",1403913600,,673,4.265625

5490962,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I love Downton Abbey and have been binge-watching. I'm a teacher and don't have time to watch during the year.

5490963,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love following the Crowley family and their staff and community through their daily triumphs and trials of living in a time and style long gone. I feel the author/writer shows us the lifestyle of England in the 1900s before and after WWI so realistically with a touch of sensation to keep us coming back. I just wish there were more than 9 episodes per season.
Love watching via Amazon Prime because I don't have to deal with commercials and can watch 2 or 3 episodes in a row.",1403913600,,479,4.393258426966292

5490972,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Okay. Matthew's dead. My favorite reason for watching Downton Abbey: the romance of Matthew and Mary. But Don Stevens wanted to go, and he felt like there's nothing left to tell, and he couldn't be put into the position of being out of the spotlight perhaps.. With Matthew around and the other events that took place in Season 4, it would've been better... however...

This season just grew darker. As people may've mentioned. I fear if season five continues this descent, Downton Abbey will move from its usual-bright, season predecessors, to joining the ranks of what fills TV now, and that is dark, dark shows with little nuggets of hope and bright-points far and few between.

I know the light-heartedness couldn't last forever with Downton Abbey, and if that's the case, I think Downton Abbey should've joined the usual British-tv routine of just retiring the show while it enjoys international acclaim, and letting its memory live on as a warm-hearted series. Instead, as I said, I fear that us people addicted to the story of Downton Abbey might be forced to see a good show go dark. I hope that this isn't the case.",1403827200,,1123,4.783505154639175

5490976,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"5 stars of course but why is this the abbreviated version of Downton instead of the way it was shown on PBS? For instance on Episode 4, I did not see the scene where Edith convinced Gregson to give back the IOUs to Sampson, when everyone was saying their goodbyes? If Amazon waits for PBS to air it before they put it up on Instant Video, then they should air the PBS version which  is more complete than the British version.( The British version allows for commercials hence the abbreviation).",1403827200,,494,4.488888888888889

From Sybil's death of pure agony to the funny antics of the Dowanger and Isobel to then again to emotional scenes with Anna and Mr. Bates back to the slow romantic love of Ms. Hughes and Mr. Carson, my heart can hardly take it. To think I wasn't going to watch this show when it first came out. I am so glad that I did. I wait with baited breath at the end of the season to the next one.....I so hope Edith will be able to find her true love and be able to watch her baby grow up from afar...I believe the train is going to be taking me on another ride on Season 5.",1403740800,,666,3.9407407407407407

I didn't like that they made the dad a financial disaster, but pulled it out with Matthew to the rescue. I didn't think this show would remain interesting to me when they got rid of the main love interest.  I didn't watch it, but today had nothing to watch and gave the show a chance.

I was wrong!  Same show, better even because there are more directions it can go now.

Win win all around!",1403568000,,514,4.3578947368421055

5491011,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"OMG!!! First of all, as usual, Amazon regurgitates good ratings of previous seasons and erroneously posts them with the new season. No way in Hades the fourth season got 3,227 five star reviews - absolutely NO WAY! It really boggles my mind how one of the greatest TV shows in history (first three seasons) could, with its fourth season, so suddenly become on one the worst ever. I think Downton Abbey will go down in history for that very reason. I know of no show that has ever made such a radical flip-flop from great to terrible, poorly done trash between seasons. If the first season had been like the fourth, Downton Abbey would have never made it to a second season.

5491024,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"I loved the previous seasons so I can reasonably be considered a fan of this show.

But last season - whew.  I struggled to maintain interest.  Mary claims that almost all single men were killed in the war and then we see an endless parade of suitors appear, all untouched by the war.  Lord Grantham has been turned into a completely dim-witted simpleton (""There's this man named Ponzi..."") and Lady Grantham says almost nothing for the entire season. And we're really going to believe that an Earl is going to turn to his valet to ask if he knows a criminal from jail who can forge a note?  Seriously?

But the most despicable plot twist was the one with Anna.  When a writer runs out of ideas you can expect that violence against a woman is going to happen and it does here.  And if I thought my husband would commit (another?) murder he wouldn't be my husband for long.  What's being done to the characters is such a complete disservice to the first 3 seasons - they should have just ended the series with the death of Matthew rather than churn out such dreck.",1403481600,37,1063,4.410256410256411

Through brilliant character development, we participate in the effect of the war on the privileged classes' sense of entitlement. We experience, along with the characters, the shock of such life altering changes as the womens's right to vote movement, dating between the races, the breakdown of the classes, and defiance of parental authority. Some are able to adjust, others stand firm. The present age is experiencing a similar dichotomy in the digital revolution.

5491081,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I recognize that the show had little choice in killing off Matthew when Stevens chose to leave the show.  No choice at all, really.  And personally I found him bland anyway.  Once he and Mary were married, they were tedious together and all he did was tell her how wonderful she was.  They lost their chemistry.

Did they rise to the challenge?  Not really.  It started off strong enough, with Mary struggling to bond with her baby and snap out of her state of catatonic anger and grief.  But within three episodes they started to introduce new male characters to buzz around her like flies and it all went off the rails.  Through no fault of the actors, the ""Three Stooges (Suitors)"" storyline was both dull and silly.

 It was far too soon to throw Mary into the marriage market again less than a year after her husband's death. It would have been much more interesting to follow through on her struggle with motherhood, or to focus on her involvement in the estate.  When the three men drove off together at the end of the season, I couldn't help but wish they would all crash that car into a ditch just like Matthew did.

The highlights were the strong acting by Laura Carmichael and Samantha bond in Edith's unwed pregnancy storyline, Isobel's lingering grief (beautifully acted as well) and..that's about it.  Tom Branson's story went nowhere and it seems Fellowes can't get enough of throwing unpleasant, abrasive, and downright awful women at him.  He's a likable character, which is a a good thing in itself when there are almost none left on the show.  But the fire has gone out of him.

The rape storyline?  Very well acted by Joanne Froggett, but the way the aftermath was handled was downright offensive. Once again everything becomes about her insufferable brooder of a husband, Bates.  And then it devolved into yet another murder mystery.  The prison story was by far the worst and most tedious of S3, and now we are getting another one?  Lazy writing at best.

All of the servants spun their wheels all season, although Mrs. Hughes was a wonder to behold as always.  Cousin Rose was a bright and energetic presence, but she failed to compensate for the sunniness and warmth and Sybil and Matthew brought to the household. I must say the Crawley Household seems like a miserable and suffocating place to exist in general.  It didn't used to be that way.

And it doesn't help that the main female protagonist is, for the most part, as chilly, self-centered acid-tongued as always.  I find her about as unsympathetic and irritating as it is possible to find a character whom I am apparently supposed to enjoy.

Hoping that things go uphill next season, but I am not holding my breath.",1402704000,7,2698,4.661016949152542

It is remarkable to see the rationale the monied classes always have for their own sense of entitlement.  Maggie Smith's question during the first season, ""What is a weekend?"" is sublime.  The family are not monsters, they are likable, caring people who are a reflection of their times and attitudes of their class.  That they never question life's primary daily occupation is dressing for meals (and even then it's unthinkable to do it without assistance) until the younger generation begins to involve themselves in helping the war effort is amazing.  That rationale for class structure, like racism, is still quite real, it's just more hidden today.

5491146,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey, Season 4, does not disappoint. After learning beforehand, as we do in life if we are listening, that losses abound in anyone's existence and life seems to have ways for us to get through the sorrows that seem impossible at the beginning, we are brought into new and old characters' lives, into their adventures and misadventures as well.
The acting is as good as it gets and the character and plot twists seem reasonable, especially given the portrayal of a changing world, since after World War I.
I see some adventurous high school and perhaps even college teachers using the entire series as a backdrop through which to teach aspects of history and one benefit of watching is that we learn in the most satisfactory of ways, through the senses as well. They are all unstoppable in their acting, but Maggie Smith is so extraordinary, and the lines given to her just ease out of her mouth delectably.

5491163,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I had never watched this show until a few months ago and since I am a Prime member, I get Amazon Videos for free. I have been a member for years, but never used the video service. I decided to try it by watching the first episode of Downton Abbey! I quickly went through all the seasons and when I got to Season 4 and had to pay $1.99 for each episode, I did not hesitate! Now I will get to watch it on TV every Sunday night when Season 5 premieres!!!!! This was worth the expenditure and if you were like me and never used the video service.....it is fantastic!!!! I use it a lot now!!!!!",1401753600,,589,4.042735042735043

5491167,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Once again Downton Abbey has left me wanting more.  I wish the season were double in length.  I am continually amazed at how these characters just pull me in to the story and make me wish I had lived during that time period and shared in their experiences.  I hope Mary finds love again, but at the same time I don't want her to move on from Matthew so soon.  I want Tom to remain at Downton and not leave for America.  And will poor Edith or Daisy ever find love.  And will Carson ever propose to Mrs. Hughes (they belong together.). I can't wait for season 5.",1401667200,,561,4.148148148148148

5491171,2,B00AQVMZKQ,The episode was good. The stars are for all the pauses in streaming that occurred during the show. The episode started ok with one or two brief pauses but about an hour in to it there were constant long pauses in playback. Not sure if comcast was having issues or if amazon was having issues. The 30 episode we had watch before didn't have these issues.,1401667200,,353,4.363636363636363

5491181,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Would somebody refer to ""lunch"" in 1912 at Downton Abbey? And having ""too much on one's plate?"" ""Signing off"" on something? I think an English major who is aware of what phrases and words were in use from 1912 onward to check these anachronistic errors would be very helpful. I find such late 20th Century and 21st Century phrases jarring from what is otherwise quite excellent period entertainment.",1401494400,,399,4.882352941176471

It was a great interest story with the art of clothing, styles, and progressive thinking as the story moves through the yrs.

5491211,5,B00AQVMZKQ,lived up to my expectations from previous seasons. The characters are great and you really get involved in their lives.,1401062400,,119,5.0

5491213,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"this series keeps  you intrigued,  one the best from bbc. hope it keeps running for years. we love watching it.",1400976000,,111,4.5
5491214,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Just adding my vote.  The huge fan base is testament to the excellence of the production.  And though it is a bit of a soap opera on one level, it is also a very interesting reminder of the difficult transition the British went through moving from a centuries-old socioeconomic system to a radically altered one.  And though it shows why the change was needed and inevitable, showing the War and other events that hurried it along, it also leaves you with a sympathy for WHAT was lost, and WHO the losers were including some in the lower classes (butlers, etc) who would not have been intuitively obvious at first blush.  The effects and dynamic of this change could never be better epitomized than in the character played with such flair and excellence by the eminent and estimable Maggie Smith.",1400976000,,796,4.705035971223022
5491215,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Extremely well written and acted. All the characters come a live and are believable. The individual story lines of the lives downstairs and the lives upstairs and then their relationships between them are brilliantly pulled off.,1400976000,,228,5.361111111111111

5491217,5,B00AQVMZKQ,A major cut above all the garbage shows on tv now. Doesn't insult your intelligence like most tv shows now. Especially the American nonsense that passes for talented entertainment.,1400889600,,180,5.241379310344827
5491218,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"I chose this, the lowest rating because the DVDs we received were technically deficient, the worst being the third.  Problems throughout were skipping frames, lapses in sound - not in quality of sound, but in any sound - and in the last episode of the third CD complete stoppage.

We enjoy Amazon and use its offerings, pleased with the product and the service we receive through Prime.  This product didn't meet your high standards of excellence.

5491231,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This show keeps getting better and better and it never fails to disappoint.  Every character has their own story so the story moves at a rapid pace.

5491250,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Several people had recommended this show to me . A friend had the 1st two discs that she let me use. I had to watch the beginning a second time , but I was very drawn to the story & characters. We ordered the last 2 discs , because I could not wait to see the rest. The characters were so interesting , especially in the way they adjusted to a dramatically changing world.  The concept of what made a marriage such a  short time ago ( compared to history of mankind) was shocking to me. It seemed so sad that some found love , while others took so much for granted.
There were a couple of surprises along the way , but the casting & costumes were fascinating. I enjoyed the extras on the DVD's  (behind the scenes.)  inter views with actors, makeup etc. It was interesting to see the transformation of very lovely ladies into the servant roles.
Someone asked me which group I identified with . I had not thought about it ,but then realized that the servants were easier to relate to. Kind of strange how they were convinced of the superiority of royalty & so willingly did their bidding !

All in all I am grateful that my friends recommended this series to me . I thoroughly enjoyed the story , but was disappointed how  it was ended. There were several intriguing plots & twists , but a few were left dangling. Maybe I just enjoyed it so much I did not want it to end.  After all the world goes on.",1400544000,,1400,4.2209737827715355

I stopped watching after the rape and don't plan on going back, I no longer give a crap about the characters.  The rape was a BAD choice.  The war was difficult but a war is a nationwide effort and burden.  Rape is a very personal, solitary burden to carry.

5491268,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The fourth season is just as interesting as the first three.  The writers tastefully pick up the story 6 months after the tragic ending of season three, sparing us the terrible grief the characters would naturally be feeling. It is almost as if the characters were given the opportunity to mourn in private.  As in the first three seasons, the acting is superb!

Downton has managed to keep the series fresh and interesting.  Season 4 sees the introduction of its first black character/interracial dating and also the rape of a beloved character.

5491305,4,B00AQVMZKQ,This is still a terrific show but it sometimes it lingers too long on a theme. The character who plays Thomas is a creep who generally ends up getting what he deserves  but all they do is bring up new instances of his creepiness time after time. Either reform or sack him. Also why kill off Matthew and then immediately introduce two great suitors for Mary both of whom would only be duplicates of Matthew?,1400112000,2,406,4.413333333333333

5491324,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I started watching the series after many of my friends.
I've found if something is mentioned to me in conversation 3X by different people...maybe I should check it out and Downton Abbey fit that category.
It's refreshing to see a program first of all about yesteryear, but also about the diverse difference of culture and aristocracy that we as Americans can't even relate to...remotely.
It has NO cursing....imagine the Granthams or the Crawleys swearing...
It has NO sex...other than what is implied...
It has NO violence...again, other than implied...
BUT...
Great story line...
Great characters that you can relate to...
Great costuming and hair...
I have just become obsessed with it.
That's why I give it 5 STARS.....",1399852800,,723,5.135593220338983

5491334,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The story line(s), the cast, the directing, the setting  just an excellent series. Top notch performances by a cast that obviously labors out of love for their craft  you will be transfixed and invested in the characters and their lives before you know it.
Just so well done, and some very solid life lessons; expose your children (I would say age12 and up) and they'll get hooked too!
This type of entertain meant is far too rare, intelligent, thoughtful and just first class.",1399680000,,477,4.734939759036145

5491339,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I now own the entire produced series. My daughter was ill and watched the whole set in one week. Just such a classic story and excellent theater quality. Loved watching the clothes evolve and the setting is superb. Masterpiece DOES IT AGAIN!,1399680000,,241,4.761904761904762
5491340,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I like this series a lot.  it seems like such a long time between airings.  I know you have to do the writing and filming but it is a hard wait.,1399680000,,144,3.6129032258064515
5491341,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"not being a ""soap opera fan"" didn't suspect that this series would be so interesting.
Acting is very good -
I liked the series because of its social, cultural and historic perspectives. Although obviously a fictional story line, the backdrop, the surroundings, the views of events from the time period and the location are somewhat authentic.... therefor of interest and value.
It seems something of a National Geographic Documentary cloaked in a fictional storyline.
The culture shock caused by the War, the practical financial implications to being in the aristocracy and financing an English estate, the need to view Estate ownership as a business, moral views toward unwed mothers, social class and the attendant distinction and interaction between them, managing ego and self esteem while pursuing self interest and maintaining social discourse and acceptance in the community.
The first 4 series have been excellent in covering a broad range of social, moral, inter-racial, cultural, pragmatic issues associated with the time period and location and keep an interesting story line.  The challenge in future seasons will be to maintain its historical and informative value and not devolve into a near meaningless soap opera with a somewhat different ""setting"".",1399680000,,1265,5.4213197969543145
5491342,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is my alternate universe.  I adore the house, the characters, the story line, the clothes, the accents, the history, etc.  I heard ""rumblings"" when Season 4 was being shown in the U.K. that Season 4 was lacking in some way -- that it didn't stand up to previous seasons.  I reserved judgement until I watched the entire Season 4 DVD.  Season 4 did lack the terrible, wrenching tragedies of Season 3.  Downton Abbey devotees will know exactly of which I speak.  Yet, there was ample suspense, passion, and surprises to make this season one of my very favorites.  It was good to see Lady Mary coming out of her grief to begin to live again.  It was even better to see Lady Edith come front and center in this season.  She really came into her own.  Lady Mary's new love interests were diverting. The Dowager Countess was impressive and impeccable as always.  Lady Rose I've never cared for and that didn't change.  It was fascinating to see how the Great War brought about such change in Britain in all classes.  Now if only Season 5 would hurry.",1399593600,,1058,4.534391534391534

5491364,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Love the show, but after watching 3 seasons I notice that they went straight back to a similar conflict-Baby comes in the world and one of its parents die.  Come one once is very believable, twice still believable, but three times?  Yes the first one the baby was a year old when his father died without claiming him, but the other two was the same day.  Now I am waiting for Edith to get pregnant, have the baby and the roof falls in and crushes her, or of course they most likely will just skip poor Edith and her horrible love life and go right to cousin Rose, the rebellious teenager.  Like I said I have watch 3 seasons but I put this revue here because I do not want to spoil anyone who hasn't seen the first three seasons.  Hopefully the 4th will start giving some more originality like what really happened in the years from the 20's to now where almost all of these houses were forever changed from victorian gilded age to museums for tourists or torn down.  Many noble families lost their homes during this time that the show barely showed.  I would have like them to talk why this was, not them having an even larger house staff then they did in 1912 at the beginning of the series, really a butler, under butler, Head maid?, 2 valets, 2 lady maids, 2 footmen, a head cook and her assistant, 3 kitchen maids(two seemed to be always quite for some strange reason), 3 house maids and a nanny/nurse.  That is only the main house and does not include the cook/maid at Crowley house, no one knows how many servants at grandma ma house and all the chauffeurs they employ for the family.",1399420800,,1591,4.351351351351352

5491371,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I find Downton soothing, like yoga class or a walk in a garden.  With that in mind, Season 4 delivered a higher dose of Zen than the arbitrary plot twists and character swerves of Season 3.  The Abbey returned to a steady keel, where even a world war failed to disrupt the routine of dressing for dinner.  Some characters thrived in the closed environment, growing deeper roots so that each appearance blossomed with potential.  Others stagnated into wooden caricature.  Treated to periodic walk-ons, they paraded frozen personality traits in case a future plot development requires a resurrection.  While fence post characters annoy, other cast members simply go missing, somewhat awkwardly as if excused due to previous engagement.  No need to name names but one departs for America and another absconds to have a baby.  And so we learn disappearance renders them dispensable.  Out of sight, out of mind, they are barely mentioned and soon eclipsed by the ghosts of the keenly missed lost from prior seasons.  Death and  familiarity have shrunk the Abbey.  The crises are less shocking and more efficiently resolved. The largest payoffs are not surprises but affirmations of the predictable.  There are some welcome and some regrettable new additions, some loose ends, some promises to keep and some intrusions from the real world, but no compelling cliff hangers to launch Season 5.  For that, I am grateful.",1399334400,,1411,5.078260869565217
5491372,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Just a wonderful cast of characters. Great acting and everything melds together - at some point. Characters are unforgettable and you just want to get to know them personally. I love this show and can't wait for the next season to come out.,1399334400,,240,4.604651162790698

These characters have become very real, and continue to keep my interest as the years roll on.

5491422,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"With the shocking conclusion to Season 3, many Downton Abbey aficionados wondered whither, and whether, the series could go on.  Season 4 demonstrates that there can indeed be life ""after Matthew"" for the noble Earl and Countess of Grantham, their daughters, son-in-law, grandchildren, mother, and ever loyal staff.

It's the 1920s, and life is really getting back to ""normal"" again at Downton Abbey after the upsets of World War I.  Lord Grantham continues to deal with the changing face of the world, assisted now by the surprisingly able Lady Mary, his eldest daughter who is now the mother of his heir.  His son-in-law Tom Branson and his younger daughter Lady Edith continue to search for roles of their own.  There's a new young lady in the house now, Lady Rose, a cousin of the Granthams who is making her London debut (her presentation at Buckingham Palace is marvelous).  Meanwhile, below stairs the servants loyally keep the house moving smoothly most of the time, barring the occasional catastrophe here and there.

I enjoyed Season 4, though in truth I must say that I find Downton wearing a little ragged around the edges.  The original concept was so quintessentially Edwardian that it doesn't seem to quite fit into the Jazz Age, though Julian Fellowes and his writing team continue to do a masterful job.  As always, it's the wonderful cast that makes the series worth watching, especially Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, Michele Dockery, and Jim Carter.",1398729600,3,1469,4.987704918032787

5491426,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I really tried to love this season, but couldn't. Edith's situation could have been summed up in a much shorter time frame, Mary just seemed cruel stringing alone her suitors, the story lines  seemed to drag on. I was happy to see more of the downstairs staff, but thats about all. I felt like the writers tried to cram too much into this season.",1398729600,2,346,4.40625

5491434,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I watched the first three season's at no charge through my Prime membership and became addicted. Especially after the way the season ended with a cliff hanger. When I found out I had to pay to see Season 4 I was near panic. My darling daughter sent me an Amazon gift card that allowed me to purchase Season 4. I am in the process of watching episode 5 of season 4 currently. I wish I had watched it when it was on TV, but didn't listen to my friends who were telling me how great it was. I will watch more British programs in the future if they are all as skillfully done as Downton Abby.",1398643200,,588,4.077586206896552
5491435,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This program continues to be excellent.  I watched all of season four on PBS and then purchased the DVD.  Other than the character of Miss Bunting (whom I'm hoping doesn't come back as a love interest for Tom Branson) and Mrs. Levinson, (I find her to be abrasive, not ""refreshing"") the series continues to have the plots and twists that keep it interesting.  The situation with Anna Bates was well acted and in no way harmed the integrity of the program.  I'm looking forward to season five.",1398643200,,492,4.620689655172414

5491437,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Obviously different people have different tastes when it comes to entertainment. Some people like professional wrestling, for example.  However, as far as I'm concerned, Downton Abbey is entertainment of the absolute highest quality.  On what do I base that judgment?  Basically, everything - acting, screenplay, costumes, sets, camera work, the multiple plot lines, the way in which the diverse characters play off against each other, everything.  I've bought the DVDs for Seasons 1 through 4; and I'll buy all future seasons as long as the series continues.  So far I've watched all of each season at least twice.",1398643200,,615,5.23469387755102

5491457,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is a fun show to watch with a family member whom you need to spend some quality time with. It's about the characters and the story. The writers push to the limits -- reaching for the outer limits of how far they can go with the characters and story. What can the craziest most extreme happening be for this story.

Even though their are un-likeable key characters -- somehow they come around and the human element is always woven in. So for the main characters -- though human foibles, issues, problems -- you see the human face when you see their trials and tests.

It's all about people. A lot of love is in the story. There is almost a couple for every character.

We finished all the seasons .... in about 3 weeks with Prime! Just waiting for more.",1398556800,,757,4.3546099290780145

I think I watched all four seasons of Downtown Abbey in less than a week.  Now I see what all the fuss is about.  It has this enchantingly facile plotting; like a book you enjoyed as a child, the narrative rips around threatening all sorts of bad things but really everything ends up okay in the end (except if one of the incredibly talented actors needs to move off to a more rewarding gig, resulting in the sad death of a character-----but even so, something good will be sure to come of that as well!  And you the viewer get to weep in concert with the Downton folk......very cleansing really:))  Amazing stable of British actors here, you can enjoy the show while reveling in the process of the acting itself!  Very easy to turn it off and start over again (tip if you fastforward by 1:03 you can avoid the opening credits and miss no plot)",1398470400,,981,4.4222222222222225

5491492,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey is a well written program. I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned so much about that certain period. The acting was phenomenol. I couldn't get enough.,1398211200,,161,5.0
5491493,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have all four seasons of DOWNTON ABBEY on dvd. All purchased from Amazon and all the UK editions. Seasons 1-2-3 all came with closed captions but for some unexplained reason Season 4 does not. If you sometimes depend on the closed captions like I do this omission can be a slight problem. Otherwise the dvd set is perfect and season 4 was great. Just no closed captions. Why make seasons 1, 2 & 3 with CC as an option and then not have it as an option in season 4?",1398211200,3,466,4.131868131868132

5491497,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"What can I say, I love this series.......but this season isn't quite up to par with the Downton Abbey of the past. Some of the same story lines are repeated, Cora is turning into a babbling nit wit, and my goodness what does Thomas have to do to get dismisssed, kill someone in broad daylight? I guess we have to have someone to hate on the show. Episodes do pick up as they season progresses so I hope Season 5 will too.",1398211200,2,421,4.146341463414634

5491512,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This marvellous series from England is magnificent in every way.  This fourth season is just as spectacular as the previous three, and it is almost comical to see reviewers vying with each other to try pick apart the series.  A smash hit certainly brings out the envy
in many!  The familiar characters are all there except for the late Matthew and Mrs. O'Brien, who runs off in the night.  The new characters are most interesting, and the scripts are so well done.  I have liked Julian Fellowes ever since Gosford Park.  The stolen letter from the Prince of Wales stretched things a bit, but it gave viewers a chance to see the old fashioned debutante presentations during the reign of George V and Queen Mary.  Queen Mary looked most appropriately bored.  Buy this DVD, buy the other seasons!  You will be in for hours of viewing pleasure, and those hours will.be repeated.  I am counting the days until January 2015 when Downton Abbey 5 will appear in the USA.",1398124800,,962,4.6390532544378695

5491516,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Without giving anything away about the fourth season, it is a heart breaker.  Downton Abbey finaly begins to take on a normal life for the Lord Grantham family after the war.  As I had already purchased the first three seasons, this was a must. I enjoy watching period-type programs like those shown on PBS.  There is so much poor quality viewing on regular TV that watching a Masterpiece Classic as Downton Abbey, well, there's no comparison whatsoever.

Watching this series I really became more caught up in the Lord Grantham family as they enter a new era. Downton Abbey is wholesome, w/o use of bad language, a program I can set with my family to wtatch and not be embarrased by what I hear or see.

Downton Abbey is a GREAT work and looking forward to seaon five in January 2015.",1398124800,,785,4.539007092198582
5491517,3,B00AQVMZKQ,I absolutely LOVE this show but it is unfortunate to have to pay $1.99 for each show. It will end up costing close to $20 for the whole season. I think Amazon should offer a season package for there Amazon Prime customers. The entire reason I joined Prime was to be able to watch this series but I did not find out that season 4 was not included until I joined.,1398124800,,361,4.098591549295775

5491522,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Absolutely divine!  Maggie Smith is my hero -- every word that drops from her lips is sublime. Cast is stellar and the whole production is excellent in quality.  I only wish that this series had begun earlier in my life and that it would continue until I'm in my dotage.,1398124800,,270,4.38
5491523,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love the program, don't get me wrong. It is quite entertaining and I love how they have develpoed the characters. But I think this season was a tad slower compared with the other seasons, but still worth to watch.",1398124800,,215,4.4

5491528,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I was so bummed out when I was moving and missed part of last season.  It was great to be able to buy it from Amazon and watch the whole season in a few days.  Now I am all caught up and can't wait for the next season.,1398038400,,218,3.5208333333333335
5491529,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have been a huge fan of this series since day one.  It is with some trepidation I even write a review below five stars.  But it is because seasons 1 and 2 set the bar high.  Season 3, while generally very good, did not quite seem to reach the heights of 1 or 2.  With the 'ahem' occurrence at the end of season 3, the show has changed drastically.  Without spoilers, I would say that many of the characters have changed, and though many portray things realistically, I felt that the 'new' characters are not quite as interesting as they once were.

A few events tend to grate on my nerves.  Most notably was the Earl taking part in a plot to re-steal a scandalous letter from a blackmailer.  Granted, he didn't want shame on his house, but the old Earl would not have taken part in something so dishonest, no matter the stakes.  Especially when he sends members of his family to con the hotel into letting them into the blackmailer's room!  Completely out of character and unrealistic.  The fallout of that scandal would have been worse than the original had they been caught!

That is just one example.  But overall the show is still good.  I do dislike that the writers take a few story arcs and beat them to death.  It's much more drawn out than even the whole Bates murder trial event.

Again - still good!  I just hope the melodrama gets toned down in future seasons.  And I know that Penelope Wilton and Maggie Smith were busy filming, but I also hope we get more of them in the next season than we did in this season.  And bonus points for Paul Giamatti.",1398038400,3,1563,4.346020761245675

Even though ""she was a nasty piece of work"" I miss Siobhan Finneran (O'Brien) who left service at Downton right at the beginning of season 4. Matt Milne (Alfred) has also left. I'm still getting over the departure of Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley), as is everyone at Downton. And I still miss Jessica Brown Findlay (Lady Sybil Crawley). I know life goes on as actors have other roles to pursue. However, to me, these actors played irreplaceable characters. (If Maggie Smith were ever to leave, I think Downton would be done for.)

I also found the first three seasons to be sweeter, more romantic. I wish Thomas (Rob James-Colier) will find a love interest in Season 5. Perhaps then he wouldn't be such a brat!",1397692800,2,789,4.676258992805756

She would not be accepted in America, so is she, too, going to get lost in Germany?  Go to New Zealand?  The last episode ended like a game of chicken with the opposing cars racing head-long for one another:  Were the cars going to crash?  Or not?  Was Downton going survive?  Was the capable manager going to scoop up his offspring and head off to America?  Nothing was resolved.  It was like a chapter-ending in the ""Da Vinci Code.""",1397606400,2,533,4.515789473684211

My Blu-ray player cannot be altered to play Region A.
It seems pointless to order any other products from Amazon as you appear not to understand the market products which you sell.
My only action now will be to seek return of my money.
Hopefully someone in authority might read this and do something about your ordering system.

Season 4 of Downton Abbey didn't have the slow connected, Human Emotions and Beautifully acted story lines that all the other seasons of Downton Abbey had.
It was easy to sit down and enjoy all the other seasons much better than season 4.

Season 4 was faster paced and didn't flow like all the previous episodes did, plus the rape scene, who wants to watch this type of violene for Downton Abbey scenes?

The writer and director should view their other episodes of Downton Abbey and go back to their foundations of simple victorian life, not Hardness and Brutality of life.  The world gets a belly full of those types of shows and movies daily.",1397088000,3,770,4.639705882352941

Things perk up with the arrival of Uncle Harold but unfortunately he's accompanied by his mother (Shirley MacLaine whose terrible performance remains even more glaring when surrounded by the brilliant Brits). And by the time we got to three suitors for Lady Mary things were back on track.

5491706,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"Many people go crazy over Cheetos, but few of the Cheetos fanatics would ever claim that Cheetos are actually ""good.""  They recognize that their favorite junk food is basically crap.  I doubt if they'd go on line and give Cheetos a five-star rating because they recognize a distinction between what they like and what is good.  When it comes to the arts, though, people are unable to make or even consider any such distinction.  If they like it, it's ""good.""  You'll hear that a classically terrible movie like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is ""so bad it's good.""  This is, of course, impossible: an excess of bad doesn't equal good. What they mean, of course, is it's ""so bad it's enjoyable.""
  Like  millions of other people I watched  the first three seasons of ""Downton Abbey"" religiously every week.  But I knew it was silly nonsense full of idiotic plot twists.  In a review of these seasons I pointed out its stupidity, but I gave it three stars anyay, as a sort of compromise between its quality and its watchability.  But I finally gave up in the fourth season, and now I can happily report I'm as free of Downton Abbey as I am of Cheetos. I'm not going to rehearse the absurdities of the plot, but let's have a little fun with the worthless characters.  Here are a few of the characters we are supposed to care about:

*.  The Earl of Grantham--a cross between the silly-ass, clueless aristocrat best captured by PG Wodehouse in his novels about Lord Emsworth and his pig and the equally clueless, pompous, self-righteous fathead Lord Darlington in ""remains of the Day.""

*  his wife--Here the problem is not so much the characters as the actress. Elizabeth McGovern.  I've never met anyone who could stand that sweet/sad crooked smile of hers. You just want to hit it with a Boston Cream Pie.

*  Carson the butler-- See comments about the Earl.  We are asked to believe that he was once a music hall performer who was abandoned by his true love.  I prefer to think he is a priest defrocked for his inability to keep his hands off the choirboys.

* Bates--Oh come on!  This character makes no sense at all.  In this fourth season he travels to London by train to kill his wife's rapist.  But the shmuck neglects to destroy the ticket stub that proves he was in London! In fact, he leaves it in his coat pocket.

*Dowager Countess of Grantham--Maggie Smith was the only reason to watch the first season.  She was, of course,, playing a version of Lady Bracknell from ""the Importance of Being Ernest.""  But they've softened the character to such a degree that she no more fun.

* Lady Edith Crawley (Matthew's mother)--There used to be (and for all I know still is) a comic strip called ""Mary Worth,""  whose eponymous heroine kept interfering with everybody's else's life.  (I remember a MAD Magazine parody in which someone asked her, ""What do you do actually beside sticking your nose in everybody else's business?"")  Well, here she is, little Miss Do-gooder

*Tom Branson--This is the Irish Catholic Socialist revolutionary chauffer who improbably marries one of the daughters. The actor's Irish accent reminds me of what the Harvard Lampoon said of Ryan O'Neal in ""Barry Lyndon"":  ""His Irish accent wouldn't fool Fernando Lamas."" Now I know the actor is from Dublin, but I'm from Brooklyn and I don't sound like Sheldon Leonard or Tom Pedi (anyone remember them?)

  Well, that was sort of fun (for me at least).  If you want a really good british series, try ""Mr Selfridge.""  It's as enjoyable as this one and you don't feel like you're eating a bag of Cheetos.",1396915200,5,3571,4.6496
5491707,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have always been fascinated by history, particularly British history. The characters draw us into an era very different from ours with the fertility lacking today.",1396915200,,165,5.384615384615385

5491728,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I would rate the other 3 series a 5 star.. This 4th series was good but lacked a little depth. It was slower than the others in story line and dragged along at times. Not much happened in this one, but liked the way they tied up all loose ends..Still was worth watching..",1396828800,,271,4.132075471698113

5491736,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This series is a delightful look at the past aristocracy in the UK.
It proves everyone, no matter their station in life, have stress and issues affecting their happiness, financial well being and family relationships. It is a continuing saga well played by the actors. Enjoyable.",1396742400,,279,5.086956521739131
5491737,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"My wife fell in love with Downtown Abbey, which doesn't happen often because our tastes are very different. This show is extremely well made, actors are superb and the story line keeps you engaged and wanting more. I hope they make Season 5.",1396742400,,241,4.627906976744186

5491746,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"When nothing on TV seems worth watching, an evening with Downton Abbey is a story with history,class, information. Totally engaging.",1396656000,,132,5.65
5491747,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"The problem with this Series is, as it progresses, it gets more like a long running soap.
Edith needs to be given some encouragement re suitors.  Surely her father with all his aristocratic contacts could find her someone other than a journalist?  She would have had to be given some sort of Dowery
Lady Mary never lacks suitors.
The horrible Footman gets worse and worse.  How much longer before he's found out?
Next series, hopefully will be the last, despite the superb costuming and the wonderful Dowager Grandmother - Maggie?",1396656000,2,530,4.866666666666666
5491748,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is officially one of my favorite shows!  Season 1-3 are great as well! I cant wait to see the next season!,1396656000,,111,4.045454545454546
5491749,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Love the quality of acting as well as the photography and the story.  The twists and turns kept us guessing.  We found ourselves discussing the likes and dislikes of the story regularly.  Can't wait for Season 5.,1396656000,,212,4.675675675675675
5491750,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The only negative to Downton Abbey is that the season doesn't last long..not enough episodes in a season.  Other than that, what a fantastic show. I feel like I am part of that era when I watch it.",1396656000,,197,4.184210526315789

5491752,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"This a great series. I have seen all four seasons. All of the characters are very interesting and well developed. If you like period pieces, this is a must see. The only negative is the number of episodes in this season (9). Most series on cable are at least 12. Waiting until next season is irritating.",1396656000,,303,4.428571428571429

5491755,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"We were unable to watch/record some of the season 4 episodes, & even missed a few things in the ones we did watch, so the DVDs hit the mark for us.  On the negative side...two of the discs were were damaged, resulting in poor picture quality in one instance.  The disc damage was so bad on one of the episodes, that we were unable to watch it!  Unfortunate, as that was one of the episodes that we had not previously watched to conclusion.",1396656000,,439,4.265060240963855
5491756,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I stopped watching TV years ago because it became nothing but garbage. I heard a lot of praise about this show so I took a chance and bought the DVD's. I'm so glad I did. I never would have thought that there could be a TV show without sex, violence and disgusting jokes, let alone a story worth watching.  This is such a  wonderful and interesting story I would give it 10 stars if I could.",1396656000,,391,4.131578947368421
5491757,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was disappointed in the 4th season - but, like life, things are never the same from one year to the next.  Still great enough to add to one's collection.",1396656000,,155,4.166666666666667
5491758,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This season was another great ride. Love the characters in the story and Maggie Smith's character is absolutely amazing as the family matron with her one liners and wisdom, great fun.  The plot twists were interesting and episode 4 was a shocker that was dealt with sensitivity and realism.
Can't wait for season 5!!!",1396656000,,317,4.87037037037037
5491759,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is a great series. Thanks for making it available. It is not available on some of the other services,1396656000,,105,4.3
5491760,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I found season 4 of Dowsnton Abbey to be great.  Anyone who knows the show knows that it is a compeling season,1396656000,,110,4.0
5491761,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Always a great way to pass the afternoon. Love the acting and the drama of this program. The story line keeps you tuning back in.,1396656000,,129,4.2
5491762,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Julian Fellowes is running out of steam I'm afraid, and I'd have preferred his narrative if he'd stopped at the end of Series 3 and not killed off Matthew.  Production values as always are top notch, but at times the storyline was just silly and unlikely. Poor  Anna is perpetually angst-ridden,  the sinister .scheming  footman is almost a joke, and Edith would be the unluckiest woman alive. Ending series 4  with Edith's lover disappeared in Germany was a real cop-out, and an obvious link to be continued in Series 5.
 Pity, because the first three series were great.",1396656000,4,571,4.775510204081633
5491763,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Looking at my 'suggested' titles on Instant, it's full of all the Romantic/Victorian/Period Series/Mini-Series/Movies I've watched and enjoyed. Downton beats them all.",1396656000,,167,6.636363636363637

5491772,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I am not normally a fan of serials or soap operas, but I loved Downton Abbey. Have seen all the Seasons. Did not like this one as much as the first three, but it was good. The acting is very good, and you really get to know and understand the characters. Keeps you guessing what will happen next. Anxiously waiting for Season 5.",1396569600,,328,4.222222222222222

After the first episode of the first season, I was hooked. I watched all four seasons already and cannot wait til January to watch what happens next in season 5!

5491781,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I love this series and so glad I discovered it on amazon prime. The characters are well developed and curious. I am intrigued by the plots that develop out of this household. O'brien was quite a character and sorry to see her go but she might be back. I could choke Thomas who is just a miserable person. Loved Matthew and Sybil and cried when they left. His lordship is quite a character as well and cannot manage finances at all. Waiting impatiently for season 5. Hope this series continues for a long while. Love it.,1396569600,,519,4.416666666666667

5491818,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"How can you not rate 5 stars to such a beloved series, especially this one.  As a basic romantic, heartache and happiness can be felt almost every minute in this season 4.  It drawn us into our current dreams through the back door of memories.  To see hope born and reborn takes us to the secure places in our minds.  To witness the birth of love between two kind people---one who thought love had passed him by forever and one who never imagined she'd ever be anything more than the magnet to draw wealth back into a family that was withering in the garden of an aristocrat whose title was more valuable than his own family.  As always, and often better, our DVD copy of Downton Abbey Season 4 will on the others in our ""what makes a family"" collection of British productions.",1396396800,,777,4.405594405594406

5491821,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"As in seasons past, the shows saving grace can be found in it's great production values. Season 4 had a somewhat more shallow story line. The entire season was much more soap opera like. Over all 3 stars is a generous rating.",1396396800,,225,4.380952380952381
5491822,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I so loved the first and second season, I have purchased them all. Season 3 was a big disappointment, but I had bought it before I knew how bad it was. Season 4 had some very disappointing parts, but was better than season 3, the ending was hopeful. I miss all the wit, charm and romance of the first two seasons. I hope they haven't run out of ideas and had to go the American soap opera route, British humor and the draw of the rich time has me hoping for next season.",1396396800,,470,4.064516129032258

5491923,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I am an avid Downton fan and like most awaited season 4 with great anticipation.  I was disappointed. The entire season was anti-climatic.  Anna's assault, forbidden love, missing Michael and what Bates may or may not have done did not leave me with the usual excitement of the abbey. Having said that, I still await season 5 in hope it will correct itself.",1395878400,,357,4.650793650793651

5491933,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Very entertaining season. I really enjoy the audio quality on these DVDs. Compared to Seasons 1-6 of Foyle's War DVDs, its like having the actors in your living room as opposed to the show sounding like it is broadcast on an old Victrola!
Looking forward to Season 5!",1395878400,,267,4.583333333333333
5491934,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Loved season 4 of Downton Abbey.  Different characters introduced. Interesting to see how places like Downton have to change with the times and how they don't want to do it but have to if they want to survive.  As always, there's a tragedy and plot twists that will keep you coming back (as if we would need a reason).........Lady Violet is in rare form and we got to see more of Cora's family from America.  Loved the way it ended.  Can't wait for season 5.",1395878400,,458,4.352941176470588

5491937,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is a great engaging series. I am not sure what the difference is between the UK version and the US version.

5491938,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"If you've enjoyed the first three seasons the fourth will not disappoint. In fact if you were somewhat ""mad"" at the ending of season three you will find season four redeeming the series that we all love. This season not only has Lady Mary showing us another aspect of herself, it throughs us a Lady Edith worth cheering for.  I am anxiously anticipating season five and how this seasons intrigues are settled.",1395792000,,409,4.680555555555555

Even if you are not a history buff, as I am, you will love the settings and performances of the characters.

5491982,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It is an all captivating and nonstop adventure. The characters are fully developed and constantly true to part. A bygone era meticulously depicted allows one to visit an elegant time period. It is an intelligent show full of period memorabilia adding to a charm totally lost today. The acting is superb. The areas used for filming are breathtaking in opulence, meticulous in every detail of life as it was in various segments of society in that part of the world.
Foremost it is refreshingly British. This is a show which will not compromise its quest for movie making perfection in our time when computer generated images are a norm and ""Good enough"" IS good enough.
A MUST ADD HERE:
After three thousand five stars l had to go check on why oh why, one hundred reviewers gave it one star. As l thought, negative opinions must surface, especially when faced with overwhelming positives. The thing here which is hilarious is, all these reviewers with one star who claim to have wished a character had remained or another had...whatever, the point? ....the point, they all had to watch it throughout first. Gotta love those Naysayers.",1395705600,,1132,4.84020618556701

5492072,5,B00AQVMZKQ,One of the best series ever! Casting is brilliant. Costuming and props deliciously detailed. And the story lines: dramatically  superb!,1395187200,2,135,5.75
5492073,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I admit it, I'm a Downton Abbey junkie.  I surprised even myself.  I used to kid my late wife when she would get involved with the TV soap operas, and although it isn't labeled as one, I can't see a lot of difference, except for the production values.  And I guess at heart I'm an Anglophile.",1395187200,,292,4.178571428571429

5492075,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I so love Downton! My husband and I watch it over and over again. Sometimes you catch little things you missed watching it the first time. The clothing is awesome and all of the actors are fabulous.  You can never have enough Downton.,1395187200,,234,4.441860465116279

5492077,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey is British TV at its finest: excellent acting and story line that is both entertaining and meaningful. The interaction between the English aristocrats and those of the lives of dutiful servants kept my interest and I look forward to the next season in production. Five stars is adequate for Downton Abbey--a refreshing series of entertainment that I can easily recommend.,1395187200,,385,5.225806451612903

5492085,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"If you enjoy Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, or Gosford Park, you'll love Downton Abbey. Each episode involves a captivating story of events in the Upper class Crawley family and the house staff of butlers, maids and footmen. Highly entertaining.",1395187200,,258,5.317073170731708
5492086,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Wondeful cast, great acting and dialogue, and always something going on.

5492088,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I love Downton Abbey! I like historical fiction in general -- gives you insight into the cultural issues of different times and places and makes it so interesting. Makes me really care about the characters!,1395187200,,206,4.914285714285715
5492089,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Cannot wait for the next season.  I don't care about British Earls and Ladies but the characters are played to perfection.  I assume that we have to prepare ourselves for the next World War and the politics that are involved with that.  We have all the series and once a year have a marathon of Downton Abby.,1395187200,,308,4.368421052631579

I like having the DVD's as the series is a classic and I will watch it in its entirety again soon.",1395187200,,254,3.7735849056603774
5492091,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"One of the best series ever to been shown on TV. I bought the DVD as soon as it came out, and watched it all at one sitting!
No advertising, and no waiting to see what happened next. Season 4 was as good as the other 3.
I bought one for my sister in law, she is not a TV addict, but she watched all of it in one go, and enjoyed every minute of it.
Well worth the money.",1395187200,,369,3.625
5492092,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I enjoyed seeing the last season, because I missed on TV.  I am looking forward to seeing the next season when it is aired.",1395187200,,123,4.125
5492093,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"My short advice -- don't bother.  I assume you've watched the first three seasons and know how well they were cast, and how compelling was the story.

The fourth season is full of contrived situations and implausible characters: anything to extend the franchise.  Instead of bringing the story to a satisfactory conclusion, the author has chosen to extend it for no good reason and so, for me, this is the end of Downton.  A real pity to debase what was such a good thing.",1395187200,15,472,4.583333333333333

In fact, I am sending it back.  Have had no trouble with Series 1-3 of Downton nor any other DVD purchased from you, but this particular dvd will not play in my player or several of my friends players.  It is a Dud! On closer examination and compared with the covers of the previous 3 series it is quite different and not as nicely presented.  Also it has PBS across the top which I don't know what that means.",1395100800,,583,4.078947368421052

5492101,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4 does a good job of picking up the pieces from the drama of Season 3, and moving forward with new stories and new characters.  I was worried about the series's ability to recover from the deaths in Season 3, but they honestly do a great job.  Downton is as wonderful as it has always been!",1395100800,,297,4.192982456140351

This is one great series!  As much as I liked Upstairs Downstairs, Downton is so much deeper and more interesting!!",1395100800,,207,4.256410256410256
5492107,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Fast shipping of the product. I love this series. It is so nice to watch something that leaves much to the imagination but is still can be interesting. It can be done.,1395100800,,167,4.25

5492110,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"What I like most about Downton is that the characters' stories show how the family's lives were firmly interwoven with those of their staff.  Even though The Great War is over, the 1920s were a time of subtle and profound changes for everyone.  In many ways, the staff were far freer to move on to other situations.  This season has many funny moments, especially when the dowager countess is in the scene.",1395100800,,406,4.611111111111111

5492112,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I simply do not care what any critics have to say - yes, it's rather soapy, contains anachronisms, a shifting cast and abrupt departures - but by god, I just flat out love this series.  There is something compelling about the order and civility of it.  Fellowes has created wonderful characters that you love to love and hate - Thomas...grrrr!

It's a staple of Sunday evening, and one of the few shows that my partner and I agree on completely.  She'd get rid of me before she gave up DA.

So my advice: relax, turn off the critical faculties and enjoy every moment.

The civility of it.  The decency of individuals.  There's no hugging but a touch means the world and a handshake seals the deal.

There is something to be said for  some of the series' old-fashioned virtues; and yes, I understand the underside as regards class, race, gender, and religion (Lord Grantham's reflections on the Catholic faith are delightfully horrid).

But our time could use a bit of the manners on display here.",1395100800,2,996,4.634285714285714
5492113,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"My wife and I are hooked on all four seasons of Downtown Abbey.  The acting is superb and each character is multifaceted.  We have our favorites and we have our villains.  We have all four seasons on DVDs and watch and re-watch them all.  If this series ever ends, I am sure we'll both go into withdrawal.  We'll probably begin a support group!",1395100800,,344,4.396825396825397

5492129,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Started watching and watched until the end.  Slowing down a bit from the earlier seasons.  Gives a hint of what the rich in america would like things to be like and how the rich want to keep getting rich and keep people in their place only to get to the point where the people won't take it anymore.  Goes up and down just like in real life.,1395100800,,341,4.059701492537314

5492132,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I really like period pieces and the scenes and clothing in Downton never fail to impress nor do the characters and plots and sub plots fail to intrigue.

My hubby and I ordered out, sat on the bed and started our viewing pleasure with much anticipation. We were not disappointed. The story line was as compelling this season as the previous seasons. It is so nice when a married couple can enjoy a program with mutual anticipation and interest. Even the employees in his firm are Downton fans and love to share after each viewing! Only wish their were more stars to grant to this classy and well written program.",1394841600,,627,4.557522123893805

While I like supporting PBS, the price was half of what it would have cost in the PBS store.",1394841600,,250,4.040816326530612
5492186,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey is an excellent series to watch. The sets and the acting take you back to the turn of the century and the 1920's. The pageantry and perfection that has gone into the making of Downton Abbey have made it such a success. Looking forward to the 5th season.,1394841600,,267,4.36
5492187,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"It would not work .  I returned it and was sent another one, but it did not work either. So I just returned it.  It was not my player, because I tried other dvd's and they worked.  First time I have had a problem with your dvd's.",1394841600,,229,3.8297872340425534

I stumbled across it by accident on Amazon Prime as I don't have cable or satellite and totally binged out on seasons 1-3.  I'm taking 4 slowly as I don't want to get ahead of the current airing and have to wait for cliff hanger resolutions. I would definitely recommend this series.",1394841600,,340,4.65
5492193,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is an excellent series that gives an interesting insight into the early 20th century, and not only among the ""upper"" class but among those less privileged and less affluent. It's far better, in my mind, than Upstairs Downstairs, which was a very fine series. I've read criticism of this fourth season that it's getting stale and needs a new writer, but I don't agree. Julian Fellows has written wonderful dialog (giving Maggie Smith some of his best), and the way he develops his story line is interesting, engaging and convincing. Of course, having superior actors who perform at their best, along with great locations, vehicles and other properties adds a great deal. My wife and I, along with many friends, are among the millions of followers who find this series is just our cup of tea.",1394841600,,795,4.810218978102189

5492197,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I have all four seasons and the demand is high for loaning them out.  Season 4 was a huge relief after the sadness in 3.  Excellent.,1394841600,,132,4.038461538461538

The characters are interesting and have British accents of course, but are easy to understand.  Only occasionally do I find the program to lag.

The acting is superb, consistent and I can't understand how the women have such straight backs.

The permutations of people trying to live lives they can be proud of in a rapidly changing world ae fascinating to me.

Wonderful acting with a setting that cannot be equaled.",1394668800,,146,4.84
5492247,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm embarrassed at how much I've been enjoying DA these past three seasons. This season was a little ""dark"" for my taste. The assault on Anna and the emotional aftermath was almost unbearable, and seemed to hang like a pall over the entire series. There were a few too many neat tie-ups at the end also that were not as creative and seamless as I've come to expect through the previous series. Still, Mrs. Hughes' and Cousin Violet's wisdom and large hearts win me over and, as always, save the day. Must say, I'm growing a bit tired of Mary's self-centeredness. This new rivalry between competing beaus is getting quite tedious, and reminiscent of when we first met her and she insisted on holding Matthew at arm's length. Can't she just be nice??

I still give it four stars because the acting is superb and the settings breathtaking. Thanks for the first drama series on PBS I've been unable to turn away from since The Six Wives of Henry VIII.  (When was that - thirty years ago?)",1394668800,,984,4.553672316384181

5492259,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4 introduced more complications to the household, both upstairs and in the kitchen.  The acting remains top notch, and the character development is struggling for further dimensions to the family and staff (Rose is there to appeal to a younger viewer, while Bates continues to mystify).  My main trouble with Season 4 was too many story lines.  Just when I wanted to absorb one story, another, then another follows.

5492270,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I download my episodes on my Kindle and watch them during my lunchtime.  I really enjoy the characters and starting to feel like one of my soaps. They cancelled my favorite soap operas and now this is a great replacement.  I am disappointed there are only 9 in a season but I had to catch up with all of the seasons. Now I am on my last episode and that's sad.  Wonder when the next one comes out...I buy them @ 2.00 until they go to Prime.  Then they are free but I couldn't wait this season.,1394582400,,493,4.051546391752577

I was taken by the smooth transitions of the lives of each of the characters that really gave the audience the connection needed to keep the desire to continue following. The characters are all very different and they each bring an element to the series that seems to nail the chemistry element. It was great to see the different human elements that make up any family, the imperfections, the ups and downs, the trials and tribulations...all make for a great storyline that anyone can find something that they can relate to. Despite this storyline being based in the 1912, it just proves that we are all so much more alike than we are different at the fundamental level of human existence!",1394582400,,825,4.619047619047619

5492303,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I read the reviews before purchasing season 4 of ""Downton Abbey,"" so I was prepared for a downbeat season. The main characters, whom we've come to know and love, are mostly present. However, Siobhan Finneran as Miss. O'Brien and Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley are missing. I read that Stevens wanted off of the show. He is much missed in this season. I don't know why Miss O'Brien left the show. She is also sadly missed as one of the most interesting actors and characters in the show.

The plotline of season 3 was a bit weak, and season 4 is weaker still. And yet I still love the series and hope its writers can come up with a more engaging 5th season. We have come to love the extended family and want to follow them through their lives. The acting is superb. The costumes and sets are a treat to the eyes. The camera work is excellent. The musical theme tugs at our emotions. Hopefully, season 5 will take us back to the better writing of the first two seasons.",1394496000,3,967,4.342541436464089

5492308,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I really enjoy this series, but I just don't know why.  The Earl of Grantham (Big Daddy to us grubby colonists) is always wrong and insufferably snobby. The only members with a whit of social conscience is the former IRA terrorist and chauffeur, who only got where he is through marriage.
The downstairs servants feel that they owe their lifelong allegiance to their ""Masters"", a sensation that I find mind-boggling.  I suppose you have to be from there to grasp that sort of predestination as acceptable - I kept feeling that here in the USA, that lifestyle would last about as  long as it takes to pack up and ease on down the road.
I suppose that you have to take the historical perspective of Castles and serfs, then just say ""That's the way it always was.""
We here in America grew up with the six-gun culture, and it marks us to this day.  I guess you are what you know.
Having said that, this is a fine series, well acted, well filmed, and I would guess, well crafted of a time in history that is truly British.",1394496000,2,1017,4.3936170212765955

Edith's life is as difficult as ever, but she is also growing as a person.  It's good to see Tom Branson coming alive again.  Miss Baxter is a nice addition to the cast.  Now if Anna and John Bates can just keep their love going after her rape by Lord Gillingham's valet and his death, possibly at the hands of Bates.  Did Mr. Bathes,  really kill Green and, if so, will he actually get away with it?  And on and on it goes with all sorts of other wonderful sub-plots!

I have no problem with cliffhangers, but I felt like so many things were drug along thru out the season and just left unanswered at the end.  I also understand that Mary is still dealing with her grief of Matthew, but it is so unfair for her to string the men along. Just choose ONE Mary & move on! That being said, I can't wait to see if Julian Fellows develops Lady Edith's story more. I'm so rooting for her to finally find real long-term happiness.",1394409600,2,551,4.349514563106796

5492379,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I loved the first 3 seasons of DA. I thought it was a wonderful show. Although it clearly was in many ways a soap opera, it still had powerful characters, interesting plot lines, and dealt with important issues that were facing those characters during an interesting time in history. I just finished watching Season 4 on TV (didn't actually buy the DVD). It's sad to say that the show is almost unrecognizable from what it was before. It has devolved into the worse kind of soap opera - overused/reused meaningless and boring plot lines, characters showing no personal growth and behaving in uncharacteristic ways, and no real movement in the story.  The characters (for the most part) are no longer interesting and the plot lines have become cliched. It is so very sad to see this happen to a great show. The magic is gone. The amazing spark and energy this show had have evaporated.

A few examples of the many problems:
-Reversing character growth - At the end of Season 3, Thomas had been helped by several DA people Anna, Bates, and Jimmy among them. He appeared to be growing as a person and starting to move beyond some of his earlier ways. Well, here comes Season 4 and Thomas is right back where he was before in being a scheming jerk. Really? There was nothing more interesting you could have come up with for this character other than a rewind? And on a related but more minor note - he keeps saying, what would appear to others anyway as, weird things to Mrs. Baxter about ""messages"" and ""information"" out where everyone can hear him. It seems odd to behave that way if you want to keep blackmailing someone.
-Reusing old plot lines - the Thomas stuff above is one example of this. But they even felt compelled to get Edna the maid back again to go after Tom. I thought we were past that. Let's move on. And poor Tom can't catch a break. Can we possibly get off the ""Tom doesn't belong"" theme?  I can understand him questioning himself, especially at things like the house party where he is forced to deal with lots of the ""upper class"" stuff he is not familiar with - however, at this point I think the family would be working hard to make him feel at home. A few kind words from Robert (which I think he would have gotten in Season 3) would go a long way. But in this season the goal seems to be to maximize strife, even if people have to behave in ways they normally wouldn't, to get it. Then when Tom meets a nice teacher, we start to think - oh good, a nice woman who can perhaps help Tom think of a romantic life beyond Sybil. But no, what does she do? She too makes Tom feel bad for being an ""outsider"" to the family, and makes him question why he is living with them - why he has given up who he used to be, etc, etc.  At the end of Season 3, I felt that Tom was going to be a big part of helping the family come to terms with the new post-WWI world - he has experience with both the aristocracy and with the working class - he could help them bridge to the new reality where those lines are going to be less harshly drawn. But instead of that - we have him constantly hating himself and full of self doubt. Again - he is not moving forward. And then repeating the plot line of again him being in an awkward situation with a woman in the house (when he gave the tour to Sarah) when the rest of the family is away - had yet more echoes of Edna. Enough already.
-What should be subplots have taken too much of center stage - the love rectangle of Daisy, Ivy, Jimmy, and Alfred was just so high school it became boring and ridiculous. Too much time was spent on it.
-Characters behaving in unusual ways - The banter between Violet and Isabelle is usually so very subtle and yet so very interesting to watch - by the end of Season 4 they were basically insulting each other outright - not the way I think they would behave. Also, I'm tired of Thomas running to Robert with stories and Robert believing them!  Robert knows that Thomas has been a jerk in the past (he was almost fired for stealing) - why would Robert take anything he says at face value? Robert has been too quick to believe negative things about staff he knows well. He's not such a fool as that.
-The attack on Anna - Seeing such a thing happen to Anna was very very difficult. And to make it worse - it seemed like just a plot convenience - they wanted something to inject some drama/conflict  into the show . Not to say that something like that couldn't have happened - it could have - but the whole scenario seemed a bit unrealistic. It just felt like someone said - ""hmmm, we need something dramatic and intense"" and they chose that. An unfortunate choice.  (Also, I think Bates would have guessed the nature of what happened to Anna right away - in the expanse of a couple of hours she goes from perfectly normal to bruised in the face and unable to tolerate her husband's touch. Hmmm, doesn't take much to figure out what might have happened to her.)
-An overall feeling of blahness - most of the plots are just not that interesting anymore. Way too much focus on romance stuff. In fact that was almost every plot:  Daisy/Alfred/Ivy/Jimmy, Rose/Jack Ross, Edith/Gregson, Mary/Tony/Evelyn/Charles, Carson/lost love, Tom/Edna, Tom/Sarah Bunting.  There is not enough substance anymore.

However, the 4th season has not been without some quality moments:
1. Watching Mary and Isabelle work through their grief in the first few episodes was heart wrenching. I felt they gave excellent performances in those shows.
2. Tom and Mary building a relationship, Tom helping her to start living life again. That was nice. I wish there was more of that in the later episodes.
3. The scene with Mary, Tom, and Isabelle in the nursery sharing their feelings about their lost spouses.
4. There were still many places where the characters shined as the did in Seasons 1-3 (just not enough).

I hope they can pull things back together for Season 5. The history these people are living through is still a very interesting time of rapid change and challenges for the world. They need to get back to their roots of this show being about the family making their path through those times and challenges.",1394323200,10,6169,4.426431718061674

5492393,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is an absolutely fabulous show! The characters come to life on the screen and with every scene you are pulled into their day to day life. I shall hate someday to see this show end! Although I did not start watching until recently, I certainly caught up quite quickly. I can hardly wait until season 5. One can only hope that Mary will find true happiness after the untimely death of Matthew. That is only one of the story lines that pull you in and keep you entertained throughout the whole show. I have to admit my favorite couple has been Anna and John Bates, I do hope they can also get back that special love that brought them together in the first place. These characters can get you lost in the show, they are entertaining and witty and yes there are even some characters we like to hate so to speak. Above all Dame Maggie Smith who I have loved since I saw her many years ago keep us laughing all the time. The writers certainly give her quite a few great one liners. She carries it off without a hitch.

5492394,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season four was great as usual. As the beginning started with a bang, the pace some what slowed almost to a fizzle mid way, and sparked back up immediately. The Christmas Special episode was intriguing indeed as the Crawley's invade London for the social season and assist in the presentation of Lady Rose MacClare in the Royal courts to King George V & Queen Mary. I was hoping that the clothes, jewels, and scenery would have been even more elaborate as I'm accustomed to from Julian Fellowes. Nevertheless it was sufficient. Perhaps there were budgetary constraints? I anticipated over the top scenery for a Buckingham palace setting as in those times things were indeed most ostentatious!  The Character Jack Ross who played love interest of Lady rose made things sizzle and a intimate love scene would have been tantalizing indeed.!!!",1394236800,,839,4.992857142857143

5492425,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"The fourth season of ""Downton Abbey"" (not including two Christmas specials) attempts to recapture some of the original spark that made its first season such a success, and comes about as close as its ever going to get. After the trauma of World War I and the deaths of two beloved family members (sadly necessary due to the actors leaving for other projects), the show can settle down and become the frothy soap-opera that its always been at heart. Only now, no one is pretending that its anything else.

SPOILERS BELOW

Set in the mid-1920s, the fourth season opens with Mrs OBrian sneaking away in the night, another causality of an actress deciding to call it quits  though in this case, at least she made it out alive  and Countess Grantham starting the search for another ladys maid.  Fellowes wisely decides to open the season six months after Matthews death in a car accident, thus sparing us the rawness of his passing (it was painful enough with Sybil), and depicting Mary as a young widow who believes she has little left to live for.

From start to finish this season is packed full of your favourite melodrama tropes: love triangles, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, murder, rape, doomed relationships, half-orphaned children, impassioned declarations of love  its all here, and its embraced with a whole-hearted awareness of how silly it all is. And I honestly say that with affection. I don't watch Downton Abbey for historical accuracy or sophisticated plots or  heck  even character development. I watch because its light, glossy, pleasant fluff. No apologies.

But season four turns out to be something of a mixed bag. Though I enjoyed the depiction of Marys movement from bleak despair to a renewed interest in life, I wasn't at all impressed by her new bevy of suitors (in fact most of the time I couldn't even tell them apart). Hapless Moseley and long-suffering Edith are once again put through the wringer, but this time they face their tribulations with spunk and fortitude, giving audiences a good reason to cheer them on.

Poor Tom Branson used to be such a firecracker, yet now he keeps falling miserably into the machinations of calculating women, and whatever character development was afforded to Thomas has now been obliterated in favour of once more making him Downtons resident puppet-master (how he still has a job is beyond me). The tedious love triangle between Daisy, Ivy and Alfred continues to stretch on downstairs, boring everyone including the participants, and poor Daisy keeps shutting down the prospects that open up all around her (Gwen was allowed to leave Downton in order to pursue career opportunities elsewhere  why not Daisy?)

Yet contrary to what most viewers seem to think, I quite enjoy Cousin Rose and her light-hearted hijinks, though Lord and Lady Grantham continue to be the most oblivious people on the planet. Im sure that Cora used to be the sharpest and most observant member of the household  now shes an utter dimwit who consistently trusts the wrong people and doesnt notice the most obvious occurrences happening right under her nose.

Something truly lovely comes out of the Violet/Isabel relationship  at the start of the show they were so at odds with one another, and now something very close to a prickly friendship has formed (though neither one of them would ever admit it). That goes ditto for Mary and Annas friendship of quiet respect and support, and of course, the platonic marriage that exists between Carson and Mrs Hughes; surely the backbone of the entire household.

All that said, there is one particularly dark point during the course of the season that was met with outrage and disgust from Downton viewers, and that was the controversial rape of one of its most popular characters at the hands of a visiting valet. Anna has been the moral centre of Downton from the shows inception, and though we (mercifully) don't see the act itself, the build-up and the fallout is harrowing enough, coming as quite a slap in the face to unsuspecting viewers. That Anna was chosen as the victim of such a crime was a strategic ploy, knowing that she was loved and admired by the audience. Would the controversy have been as pronounced, if this storyline had played out between  lets say  Jimmy and Ivy? I doubt it.

The aftermath is even more troublesome, for even though I give Fellowes credit for not victim-blaming Anna or glossing over the trauma that comes in the wake of a sexual assault, the storyline that follows is much more focused on Bates and *his* pain over whats happened than Anna herself (and Annas insistence that Bates not be told whats happened to her in case he takes revenge on her attacker means that every other woman in the house is put at risk because of BATESS stubbornness).

Yet despite this, there are some highpoints that make up for the sour notes. Violet giving her bereaved grand-daughter a simple I love you. The magnificent Mrs Hughes confronting Annas rapist. Mrs Patmore expressing to Daisy how proud she is of her. A fun sequence in which Rose strikes up a rapport with a village boy before scurrying to conceal her identity. Several touching scenes between siblings-in-law Tom and Mary, both lost without their spouses and struggling to support each other. And finally, Edith fighting for her right to happiness and taking matters into her own hands when it comes to the future.

There are return appearances from past characters such as Evelyn Napier, Charlie Grigg and Mr Mason, and a guest appearance from New Zealand opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa as Dame Nellie Melba. Theres even a long overdue update from Gwen, not seen since the first season.

What else can be said other to say that its quintessential Downton Abbey, with everything youve come to expect. As ever, the costumes, set design, score and cinematography are a high-point, all beautifully and meticulously presented to create a visual encapsulation of the mid-1920s. Say what you will about his plotting (or the man himself) creator Julian Fellowes knows how to give his actors witty, breezy dialogue, and though I wish he would pull back on the romance (never his strong point), there are a variety of familial and platonic interactions that are as compelling as they are unique, existing between sisters, in-laws, friends, rivals, and of course masters/servants, the relationship which has always been the bedrock of this show.",1394150400,,6408,4.902033271719039

5492437,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I've been chewing on these thoughts for a while and it's time to write them down. This is going to be a bit of a rant. In general, I felt that the writers basically repeated all of the same gimmicks from earlier seasons. Below you'll see what I mean.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

THE REPETITION:
1. Thomas is still a jerk (Thomas is the token jerk throughout the series, but he at least enlisted our sympathies in season 2 and 3).
2. Thomas still has uncanny power to influence the thinking of the gentry he serves, and they never question it, EVER. (re: every season)
3. Uh oh, did Bates murder that guy or not?? (re: season 2 where we wondered if he had killed his wife)
4. Speaking of Bates, he certainly knows a little about unsavory activities (re: season 3 when he's in prison)
5. SCANDALOUS BABY ALERT! Fine, at least this time it was in the family instead of the servants (re: season 2, with Ethel)
6. One of the servants is trying to better themselves again, specifically Alfred (re: season 1 when Gwen became a typist)
7. Branson and Edna sittin' in a tree... but not really (re: season 3; why the heck did they even bring her back?)
8. Lots of kitchen jealousy concerning Daisy, the guy she likes, and how it's unreciprocated (re: season 1, then again in season 3)
9. Daisy once again gets an opportunity to leave Downton (re: season 3 when she was going to move in with Mr. Mason)
10. Are Carson and Mrs. Hughes going to get together or not? All these romantic overtones and no follow through (re: every season, but can't remember specifics)
11. Assorted men are pining for Mary, and they are willing to break off their other relationships for her (re: every season). On a side note, I NEVER understand why. She's a very disagreeable person, snobby as all get out, and not particularly interesting.
12. Not ANOTHER scandalous relationship! (e.g. Lady Rose with the black singer, re: every season has a nontraditional relationship that makes all the high class ninnies gasp and gossip)
13. Poor Mr. Molesley gets the short end of the stick, ALWAYS (re: every season since we first met him)
14. Poor Lady Edith can never catch a break in her love life (re: every season)
15. Good ol' rebellious Rose does everything she can to frustrate the expectations placed on her (re: season 3)

OTHER THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
1. Anna is so righteous and innocent, and then you're going to have her abused like that? Such poor taste. I felt it was a cheap trick the writers came up with to shock us all, when maybe a lesser character would've been a better choice. I think they realized they didn't have the material to keep this season interesting, so they threw this in hoping to bolster the lack of drama.
2. Thomas' motives for attacking Anna and Bates, as well as his hold over Baxter, felt completely contrived.

3. Everyone is incredibly two-dimensional. In earlier seasons we sympathized with Mary, Lord Grantham, Cora, even Thomas, and honestly most of the characters. We also learned of the depth of Daisy, Carson and Mrs. Hughes. This season, I cared about NONE of them, excepting Anna and Bates (Bates only at the beginning), Lady Edith and Isobel Crawley. All the characters have the same mannerisms they've always had (I especially loathe Cora's peering-over-the-top-of-her-glasses-crooked-smile look, even though she isn't wearing glasses), they all say and do what you expect them to, and they have all the same problems. It felt like I was just watching everyone simply do their jobs and flit about with their usual petty squabbles. I couldn't even force myself to care.

4. Branson was so FAIL in this season. Yes, I get that he needed to struggle with the death of his wife, but he was so whiney the entire season ""waah, I don't fit in"", ""waah, I'm so lonely"", ""waah, should I leave or not?"", ""waah I don't have a political opinion any more"". He starts a somewhat romantic interest with a smart girl he meets at a rally, but they don't develop that at all in the season.

5. I also get frustrated with how EASY it is for the servants to sabotage each other (Spratt sabotaging Mr. Molesley, Thomas trying to sabotage everyone and succeeding, and something with Baxter blaming someone else for a mistake that was made sewing, can't remember exactly)
6. I also didn't care about any of the characters they added, especially at the end.
7. The pacing was better in the earlier seasons. I felt I knew who was who, what they were doing, and it all mattered. This season it seemed like they kept our heads spinning with numerous characters and problems, most of which didn't make any sense at all. I also never understood why they were having the parties they were having at Downton. It just felt like a hodge-podge of characters and activities. Maybe I just didn't really pay attention.

THINGS I LIKED:
1. I think Lady Edith is my favorite character. First of all, she rolls with Mary's unmerited disdain for her rather graciously, she has significantly more depth than the other characters, and she FINALLY found love, though of course it was destined to fail anyway.
2. Isobel Crawley managed to add a dimension this season. I've been irritated by her in every season, up until Matthew died. It's good to see her humbled and be something other than holier-than-thou.
3. I found Bates forgiveness/understanding towards Anna after everything went down rather moving. Even though I hate what happened to Anna, I felt the writers dealt with the intra-marital processing of it rather well. It was probably the only moment in this season where I felt something.

Overall, I this this was an incredibly lackluster season that recycles what they've already done. Downton has lost its magic for me. I loved seasons 1-3, but something died in this one. It'll be interesting to see if they can recover it next season. I'm not getting my hopes up.",1394150400,,5835,4.663751214771623

Happily, I was able to stream  the first 3 episodes,  thanks to my being a Prime member.  One of the many advantages of Prime which I also highly recommend.  The series combines likable, well acted upper class British family in  historical perspective, so it is educational as well.

But now I am angry I've wasted my money on renting the whole season 4. After avidly and happily watching the first 3 seasons, which brought this  show the deserved phenomenal global success, season 4 made me feel I've been cheated. From script, to story line, to character introduction and development it all falls flat. It's almost too  painful to watch. It feels like after being served a 12 course gourmet meal, made with the best ingredients one could find, now I have been force fed a hardship stew, even if it was served in a silver bowl. Either the writer cracked under the pressure or creative team got bullied by aliens, in any case, season 4 is a disaster for the Downton Abbey saga. I only hope that it can be brought back to the standards that made it a success. How very sad :-(",1393891200,11,962,4.398876404494382

5492553,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Having waited to watch Season 4 of Downton Abbey as it aired on PBS, and then going back to re-watch immediately after on blu-ray, I am struck by how much was in this season.  The costumes and acting and script is, of course, still brilliant and one of the best things on tv, IMHO.  Plus, how can you go wrong with the backdrop of Downton with its incredible rooms and the estate.  No matter that, this season, we spend some time in London, the estate and the house remain part and parcel of this show.

The stories both upstairs and downstairs still draw us in, as do the characters.  We love them.  We hate them.  There is romance and intrigue and discovery and wonder.  What more can you want in a drama?  In addition, the modern world keeps coming into Downtown--as we've moved from the introduction of the telephone and electrity in earlier seasons to sewing machines, mixers, and even talk of a refrigerator!  Its interesting to see what we take for granted these days as something strange and new and even a bit frightening.

Some spoilers below.

Very much, Season 4 is about love and loss.  Not just the obvious about Mary mourning the tragic loss of her husband, Matthew, as she lingers in the beginning between life and death.  But we all know her strength, even if she seems to have lost sight of it.  I also enjoyed the scene where the Dowager talked to Mary about making a choice over coming out of her loss, and also how she told off her son, Robert, when he would protect Mary from everything, even herself.  Its also good to see so many men chasing after Mary--she well deserves it!

Edith also faces love and loss and having to make a hard decision when it comes to her own love, Michael Gregson, and I've gone from disliking Edith as a character to feeling sorry for her and even admiring her for her own strength.  She's really come into her own in this season.  Her big choice, however, I suspect will come back to haunt her in Season 5 perhaps?

Branson is still also in mourning, not just for his wife but for his life.  He seems more unsure in this season, as if the fire had gone out of him.  Yes, he meets a new interest, but I'm still waiting for him to become the firebrand we knew from previous seasons...if only a bit more down to earth.  I really felt his story was one of the low points of the season, as I honestly don't care as much about him as I used to.  The other plot line I don't care for is Rose.  She just seems spoiled and annoying most of the time and we all know her romance with the bandsinger would come to nothing in the end.  I wish they would get Branson back to being himself again and figure out what to do with Rose besides trot her out to dance and play music and flirt all of the time.

Downstairs, there is the triangle of unrequited love with Daisy and Ivy and Alfred, which I thought they resolved in a very grown-up fashion.  There is also the question of what does Thomas hold over Cora's new maid?  Not to forget, the darkest plotline in this season--the brutal attack on Anna.  This was very hard to watch and really brought home some of the issues of being a woman in the 1920's.  When her husband finally found out and comforted her, it made me cry.  As for Mr Bates--did he or didn't he?  The Anna-Bates storyline remains one of the best in the show, shrouded as it is in hardship and pain over which the power of their love for each other wins through.

The final episode went from the palace to the seaside and, I must admit, watching our dour butler wading is well worth waiting a whole season for...

Overall, this is a great season and it remains a great show.  I can't wait for Season 5!",1393891200,3,3658,4.296783625730995
5492554,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Entertaining and beautifully photographed. Decor and costumes are thrilling to the eyes. Fascinating nuances of class differences in England society and working class.,1393891200,2,167,6.304347826086956

5492561,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"There is something about Downton Abbey that captivates fans. More than its authenticism, more than its characters or cast or even its plot twists, Downton is a voyeur's paradise, a glimpse into a world and an era, which--while for most is a distant echo--represents a time when our world retained a memory of innocence yet whispered of great evils on the horizon. No one should miss this series.",1393891200,,395,4.823529411764706

The characters are interesting and diverse - and the view into the change in the aristocracy as a result of the economic and political changes in the first part of the 20th century is enlightening.

I have to say, though, that this was the most disappointing season so far.  They started a ton of possibly interesting story lines (even did some re-dos of previous ones), but didn't finish anything.  The season finale felt like just another episode, nothing special.  Every episode of the first 3 seasons were packed with exciting events, new characters, and scandals.  This one was just filled with everyday life.  I really hope that they take it up a notch for next season.

If you haven't watched Downton Abbey yet, by all means do.  It is still an amazing show; probably the best on TV right now.  This season just didn't measure up to the extremely high standards we have come to demand from the ""masterpiece.""",1393804800,3,866,4.6381578947368425

5492695,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I have purchased all episodes and watched at least 20 times.  It is the finest of all.  The mind could not be idle because the script kept the watchers attention at all times.  Never a dull moment in the whole of it.  I am very anxious for  season 5,1393718400,,249,4.0

5492699,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It is such a pleasure to watch ""reality"" without it being bloody, noisy, sexiest, people screaming at each other - a true gem of entertainment.  So many of us are under stress of some form, Downton Abby takes you away from everyday, sometimes mundane situations for at least an hour.  The only negative is waiting for the next episode.",1393718400,2,335,4.661016949152542

5492702,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I can't really justify my addiction to this drama about spoiled rich Brits, and Mary is already beginning to wear a bit thin, though I admire the poise and confidence of her character. The acting is excellent, the clothes are beautiful, the interiors are ravishing, the accents of the servants are melodic, and Season 4 continued to hold my interest. I'll be waiting for the next season.",1393718400,2,387,4.791044776119403

5492705,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Love this series! The simplicity of a story woven into interesting characters through history. I ordered first 4 seasons on Amazon and looked forward to watching each day. I was recovering from an operation and this was a great series to comfort me! Can not wait for season #5!!,1393718400,,278,4.6938775510204085

Really get involved with the characters. Some of the things that happen to some of the main characters
was infuriating BUT the way the writers blended the endings was GREAT>",1393718400,,275,4.52
5492707,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I would tell the whole world to watch all 4seasons of this.  It is incredible.  From the wardrobes to the characters there is so much to enjoy.  I think the very uniqueness of each character is the highlight of the series.  Also the servant/family relationships  are extraordinary.  So well written !

5492709,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"What can be said of Downton?  The stories are compelling, the characters continue to grow and reveal their strengths and weaknesses.  Lady Rose is a nuisance but Mrs. Crawley is the star of this whole season.  Her humanity and love for all her neighbors is sterling silver. Violet continues to be the spice of DA but even now has a more loving and humane character than she displayed in the previous seasons.  Mrs. Hughes may be the finest example of highest womanhood and courage.  If there is no fifth season, I am willing to be content; if there is there are so many loose ends to be tied up!  DA is the finest drama series in the history of television!",1393718400,,656,4.425
5492710,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I am so hooked on this program.  I haven't seen it before but have heard of it.  I watched all 4 seasons just to see what this show was all about and I can hardly wait to see the next season.  I like having all the seasons available to me so I can re-watch them over and over till I figure who is who and what the show is all about.,1393718400,,332,3.647887323943662

5492718,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"After the first three seasons, where we learned that having a child will destroy your life - there aren't too many people to bump off.  The story lines are not the best, and hopefully in next season the remaining characters will find their balance without the folks who were all killed off previously.  My biggest criticism is: Why is Lady Cora a complete idiot about the staff, and at some point Thomas just needs to go to America and stay there - he's useless as a foil and pointlessly creepy.",1393632000,8,495,4.488888888888889

5492720,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have all 4 seasons now and have enjoyed them all.  The costumes have always been beautiful but this year they were outstanding

I love Maggie Smith.  Only Lady Violet can get away with what she says.  She is outrageous and wonderful.",1393632000,,235,4.523809523809524

5492723,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I adore the show as much for the fantastic Maggie Smith as for anything else. It's gotten a tad soapish, but I can't quit!",1393632000,,122,4.125
5492724,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It has plot, subplots, suspense, historic interest and a fair smattering of humor. Conflicts develop at interpersonal levels and at class levels as well.

This is a very watchable story of struggle with societal change (a very modern theme) kept alive with lively action and good humor.

Highly recommended.

5492729,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I enjoyed this whole series immensely. The characters are interesting, funny at times, and the interaction between them is great, just like watching a virtual reality; the acting is outstanding and I love their British snobbery.
Maggie Smith is still a great actress, my daughter in law says I remind her of her. Don't know whether that is a compliment or not but they also enjoyed the series. I was sorry it came to an end, I was ready for the results of the child coming to live there under cover, the romances of Mary and the on going back and forth between the others. It was so well acted, kudos to all.",1393632000,,608,4.389380530973451

He normally doesn't like much on TV.  My only criticism is the season is too short.  This season just started in January and already the last of Feb, they had the finale.  I don't understand that.  Please, let it be a longer season!",1393632000,,401,4.410958904109589

Well filmed.",1393632000,,349,4.532258064516129

Commercials, that is.",1393632000,,307,5.26530612244898

5492744,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season four was breathtakingly beautiful and action packed!  After the death of Matthew Crawley I was skeptical about how they were going to flesh out Mary Crawley's character, but Julian Fellowes prevails, and gives Mary and the viewer many suitors to choose from.  Always a joy to watch, even poor Edith's story line will keep you intrigued!  A must see show for anyone who loves romance, history, and British hierarchy!!!!",1393632000,,425,5.042857142857143

5492750,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"The season was quickly over. Now we must wait until next year? for season 5? Not well timed. The acting is always good. Maggie Smith is a trip! The children are not often shown. We do not have a sense of their personalities or integration into the family life.  The societal idea that the old traditions have to change is interesting. I liked the part with Mary and the pigs!  Of course we knew what would happen with Bates and the molester. I like the relationship with Mosley and Cora's lady. So there ya go! Wait....wait....

The open stories of the ""Family "" of the House  and then the corresponding stories  featuring members of the
household staff. These stories about a much more polite and  hardworking society  are an example to us
compared to the incessant rudeness and sarcasm that is the core of most modern day ""soaps""

5492813,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was pleased to see some of the writing that was so that had me hooked in seasons 2 and 3 towards the end of season 4. To be honest some of the writing in the first half of season 4 was a let down. It didn't have the zest, intrigue or  the sassy dialogue that was seasons 2 and 3 had so richly intertwined throughout those seasons.
It seems that Edith, Rose and Tom Branson (Sybil's widowed husband) will continue to have a tendency to keep getting into trouble.
It will also be interesting to see how things develop with Mary and her current two suitors. Each one of the suitors has their own merits.
I was very disappointed in the casting of Cora's brother when they went with Paul Giamatti. I have seen him portray a villain very well but he was a poor choice for the role of someone who is supposed to be a well known playboy. The character was also poorly written because he had no social graces at all. They could have made a much better choice for this role in terms of writing and casting.
I enjoyed the little storyline for Daisy and the possibility of romance for Mr Carson.
Episode 9 has me anxious to see the new developments for the upcoming season 5. It's a shame that it will take nearly another year before we can see it in the United States. (sigh)",1393545600,,1266,4.231404958677686

Being able to have the subtitles that are possible from Amazon clarifies the program immensely.  It's amazing what I miss when I watch it without the captions and then watch it with them.  The character relationships are difficult to follow and being able to read the names helps.  Overall, I find that the program draws me in and keeps me rivited.

I was hooked after the second episode when I could see that the quality continued.  I have discussed this series with friends and trying to decide why it is so well received.  My thought is that this can be likened to an adult fairy tale; the life challenges are my the same as we experience today, but the setting is in a time either before those my age born in the early 40's.

Keep in mind the opening sequence for the first couple epsiodes.  That's far from all, but don't wish to spoil the experience for those who have not watched it yet.

5492855,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I absolutely love this show. Can't wait till next season. They develop the plots and characters so well, they never run out of fresh material or story lines.  I do miss Matthew, tho!",1393459200,,182,4.515151515151516
5492856,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love the series but viewing the program required 4 stops for the download to complete. Downloads seem to be slower and more broken up than in the past. We are on Directv, are they doing this?",1393459200,,193,4.243243243243243
5492857,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Can Julian Fellowes write anything badly? I don't think so. Season four's episodes hang from the same cliff he left us on throughout the first three seasons. Love the BBC version: longer episodes.,1393459200,,196,4.96969696969697
5492858,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It's a great program.  I cannot wait for the next episodes.
There are so many characters to love (and hate).
The dialogue is terrific.",1393459200,,134,4.583333333333333
5492859,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It was excellent,cant wait for #5 to come out. Every thing about Downton Abbey was where I wish this world would be,
Ladys were respected and Men were gentlemen. What a wonderful Era.",1393459200,,183,4.575757575757576
5492860,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"There are new characters and many plot lines to follow in this fourth season, but it is worth the effort to follow them. I thought the ending was particularly well done. While the show could end here satisfactorily, it also left the door open for more adventures in another season. Fingers crossed that the actors and writers decide to carry on. I don't think the Downton story is nearly ready to end!",1393459200,,401,4.583333333333333
5492861,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I just love this show.  I love the time period, clothes, house,  and the witty house help. I talk about this series all the time, I would recommend to anyone.  I have sat and paid to catch up on a season when I first was introduced to this adventure.",1393459200,,250,4.061224489795919

5492864,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I love period shows and this one is it. That you don't often see on TV or in the movies. This TV show is so well done. I love the fact that it doesn't have a lot of sex drugs and rock 'n roll. I long for the days when people were polite and had manners and good morals and values. If you can't live it in real life It's nice to at least watch it on TV. Lol,1393459200,,356,3.518987341772152
5492865,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is a rip off. I paid to watch the first episode, but this only includes the first half of the episode (which was supposed to be 2 hours long). I started watching episode 2 and realized I was missing a ton of information about what happened in the season premier! Not worth paying for. Just go to PBS dot org and watch the full 2-hour episode there.",1393459200,,353,4.205882352941177

5492868,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I like the story line and was happy with it,, but it seemed to be way to short.  We waited for so long to get Season 4, then it was over
in the blink of an eye.  Just seemed it should have had more.... Now how long will we have to wait for Season 5?
It is such a great series that I always want the next.",1393459200,,304,3.5223880597014925

5492870,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is truly addictive. It is peopled by personalities differing to a large degree, but all interesting and unique in their own ways. The tension is maintained largely by the existence of Barrow - who, I must admit, deserves all of the negative things that are bound to come his way. I hope they come his way.",1393459200,,319,4.517241379310345
5492871,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"We do enjoy this series. Great acting and the story line is good.
We are looking forward to Season 5",1393459200,,100,4.05
5492872,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton is still one of my all-time favorite shows, but this season, the suspense was more annoying than intriguing, in many cases.

Will Mary finally accept one of her three suitors? Will Ivy love Alfred, or will Alfred love Daisy? Will the long-suffering Mr. Bates go to prison again? Yawn!

Maybe it's just the consequence of running a complex show for four seasons, but the writing wasn't steller this time around.",1393459200,2,418,4.873239436619718
5492873,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"We like to watch the original UK versions since there are sometimes brief scenes cut from the PBS version.  Downton Abbey is a classic that you will want to watch again.  (We have already started over and seen Seasons 1 and 2 again.). The DVD was well done, as usual.  I preordered, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the price had dropped at shipping time.  Thanks, Amazon.",1393459200,,380,4.544117647058823
5492874,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Enjoy the series very much. Am glad that I can download the series when I miss it to catch up. Anyone that loves history will love this show.,1393459200,,141,4.071428571428571
5492875,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Find the history of estates like Downton Abbey very interesing and the storyline does a good job of mixing that history and what life would have been like at that time.,1393459200,,168,4.451612903225806
5492876,5,B00AQVMZKQ,We love the series and are delighted that we could catch up on the episode that we missed. It was easy.,1393459200,,103,3.9523809523809526
5492877,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"After the death of Matthew at the end of season 3, I wasn't sure if I could go on. I mean, really ""go on"".  But, after months of therapy, I realized that we are all expendable and replaceable, often to the better. Can't wait for season 5 when Carson marries Hughes, Mary marries somebody, Thomas dies at the hands of Mosley, and Edith enables another loser.",1393459200,,357,4.409090909090909

5492880,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Gosh I love this show!  It has many historical inaccuracies (such as the family treating the servants like close relatives) but to me that's what makes this show so wonderful.  The writers are able to merge the upstairs and the downstairs which gives the show a feeling of cohesiveness.  It's as if we're watching a show about a small town rather than a large house.  Barrow's humility at being allowed to return to Downton Abbey & even given a much better post is all gone and he is back to his nefarious ways. Mary is coming out of her extended period of mourning & beginning to realize that she is a hot commodity.  Bates & Anna are caught up in a web of lies & deceit that just may break them apart...and could end up with someone being hanged.  Cousin Rose is at her rebellious best.....Not the cliffhanger this season that we had in previous seasons, but all in all a stellar season - as usual.",1393459200,,900,4.391566265060241
5492881,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I LOVE this series!!!!!  This show makes me feel as though I am there with them.  I am on pins and needles waiting for each next episode.,1393459200,,137,4.037037037037037
5492882,5,B00AQVMZKQ,An intriguing period drama with Classic Brit humor.  I love all the characters and how the stories are alway changing.,1393459200,,118,4.9
5492883,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The writing and acting is so well done.  I appreciate the compelling stories that sometimes focus only on the family or the staff or as often is the case both the family and the staff are linked together in an episode.  In addition, I appreciate the efforts the show makes to stay true to the time period.",1393459200,,305,4.333333333333333
5492884,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Just the thing for this LONG COLD winter!
Spent the weekend doing a marathon of Downton.  Puts you in another time and place , makes you forget the sub zero temperatures outside!
Love the costuming and getting to pick up on little things you missed the first time around.
Now if I just had Mr Carson available to bring in another pot of tea and biscuits!",1393459200,,354,4.363636363636363

5492889,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"why did i give it this rating?  there is nothing like it on .... and it has so much substance

5492892,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I got hooked on this just by chance. and so I tried to be patient and wait for weekly shows .. but COULDN'T so I had to purchase this to hurry and watch it all Now want to buy the book,1393459200,,184,3.5121951219512195
5492893,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"While I can stream seamlessly all Netelix shows, the 4th season of Downton Abbey does not stream in a satisfactory manner. It continuously stops and reloads. I do not think it has subtitles or hearing impaired subtitles.",1393459200,,220,4.972972972972973
5492894,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Something seems to be missing. Not quite finished. Rose doesn't seem to fit in to the story and the American link is up on the air,1393459200,3,130,4.038461538461538

5492897,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"There were some people who say that this season awns' as good as seasons 1 - 3. I disagree. Even though I had taken a peek at some of the comments in the other parts of the internet and knew a little about what was going to happen in advance, I still was amazed at the plot twist and character development that was in this season. Maybe other people thought there were dull points in this season but I didn't notice that at all. While a few characters left, the nephew ones that were introduced did not disappoint. This is worth the $1.99 price per episode that they asked for.",1393372800,,577,4.254545454545455
5492898,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love Downton Abbey and I was totally hooked to the first 3 seasons. I watched episodes after episodes and could hardly take myself away from it. But, Season 4 was a disappointment to me. I'm halfway through the season and it is nowhere as captivating as the first 3 seasons. It doesn't seem to have a real story anymore. I don't like how they decided to kill Matthew - shouldn't there be at least 1 happy couple in the show? It seems so sad and bleak with 2 person losing their partners at such young age, 2 young children without 1 parent. The season just seems lost, without cause anymore. I also think pairing Edna with Tom wasn't a good move - it just doesn't make much sense to me. I hope they buck up in the future seasons (if there is any), or I will just repeat season 1 to 3.",1393372800,3,786,4.143790849673203

Give it a try... fascinating character development, and extremely well paced series... love it!",1393372800,,141,6.05
5492900,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I like the characters. I like the love interests.  My favorites are mr bates and his lady although I didn't like her getting raped. After all the troubles they've been through I thought they could take a break on those two,1393372800,,222,4.414634146341464

5492902,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is the best series I have seen in years. I was unable to see previous seasons so I caught up through Amazon before watching this season. It was worth the wait. I am looking forward to the final episode and next season.,1393372800,,223,4.209302325581396
5492903,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love the interplay of the characters and  the plots. One criticism: I don't know who the writers are but they do betray acute Anti-Americanism. I'm American and do take offence that the least refined people are both Americans-they are ludicrous. The lady of the house is american and charming (Elizabeth McGovern) but Shirly MacLaine and her son (a good actor usually) have lines that are embarrassing and crude.  She dresses horribly. Why pick on America so obviously? We have as many refined, well dressed people as you guys do.",1393372800,2,532,4.9
5492904,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Now with a little more ground on the people should make the next season great. I like bring in people slowly so that you can understand the whole show,1393372800,,150,4.206896551724138
5492905,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Initially, I thought this program looked incredibly boring until one night my husband and I decided to give it our ""ten minute test,"" (we watch a movie or television show for about ten minutes and if we aren't hooked, we don't waste any more time with it). Not only were we caught up in the stories, but had to watch one program after another, averaging about three every night until we got completely caught up.  The acting is superb, the directing, writing, historical research is all, as they say, ""spot on."" This show is ANYthing but boring!
We feel as if we've been swept up into a different time period--a little like taking a vacation...I'm not kidding.  Here we were learning all sorts of marvelous, historical things and had only set out to be entertained.
The only drawback I could possibly imagine is that two of the ""villains"" seemed to simply be vicious, evil people and one dimensional for a while there, but then most people who behave badly don't often appear to be more on the outside, either.
Watching Downton Abbey truly is like walking in to a time machine--but be forewarned, if you watch the first show you'll want to see all the rest!",1393372800,,1157,4.611650485436893
5492906,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I watched the first three seasons via Amazon Prime and became ""hooked"". Bought the 4th season to watch and now will have to wait until next year for season 5. It is a series that I am totally immersed in. The characters, the customs, the times are all so very interesting. I highly recommend it!",1393372800,,295,4.381818181818182
5492907,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I hate that Matthew and Sybil are dead, but the story really improved in overall mood as it went on.  They even gave Anna and John  Bates a happy moment.  I look forward to Season 5!",1393372800,,182,4.0
5492908,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Enjoyed the story line, characters full and rich.
Beautiful location. Costumes are lush and helped to add a real feel of the time in which the story takes place.
Totally entertaining. Lots of fun.",1393372800,,196,4.794117647058823
5492909,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Marvelous interesting series should please most people. It is great to be able to see how the rich and the servants lived in class conscious England. Hope this series goes on and on with more enticements to watch.,1393372800,,213,4.631578947368421
5492910,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I wish I could just see the whole season in its entirety without waiting a week. the characters are all well developed and played. Being a little familiar with history I wonder how they will manage with what lies ahead,1393372800,,218,4.475
5492911,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I love this series and find it difficult to wait for the next DVD. My husband also enjoys this series.,1393372800,,102,4.15

5492918,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Expertly written and acted.  Amazing production.  It's hard to believe I would be interested in a Lord and his family and how they live but it is enticing and well done that one forgets the who and appreciates the relationships.,1393372800,,228,4.675

I did buy the UK version for the USA...,1393372800,,324,4.8545454545454545

I wasn't quite sure I was going to like the show, even after hearing all the hype about it. So I decided to watch the first couple of shows so I could at least say I made the effort and thus fell in love with the show.

So I raced through watching seasons 1-3 and luckily season 4 was out by then. Some of the newness has worn off but this is still quite a show. Stellar performances (I especially like Maggie Smith); fantastic settings; beautiful costumes - this is quite a quality production.

And this is a series that the whole family can enjoy, especially teens and older. I got my husband hooked on it and he's enjoying it almost as much as I am.

I especially appreciate that I could add English subtitles to the shows since I am partially deaf AND the British accents can make the dialogue a little hard to understand at times.",1393372800,2,1228,5.663043478260869

5492925,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love anything that take me back in time as these times we live in I find extremely depressing.  Downton Abbey does just that and more. It is rich with different characters and there is never a dull moment.  My husband and I cannot wait until the next Season is released!! Yes, even he likes this series. I like just about all things British and he needs the subtitles on , if you can believe that! I am surprised that a man who prefers action and special effects in his movies or a comedy, really does like this also. I could not say who or what type of person to recommend this to.........try it for yourself, it is drama packed and filled with real life situations and is a work of a certain era. I think anyone who loves history and human nature in general would enjoy this.....Oh, and of course all things British may help!",1393372800,,829,4.3076923076923075

5492933,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"What can I say?  This was wonderful!  I loved it, but then I loved all of the Seasons.  I was shocked at how they handled O'Brian's leaving and the attack on Anna.  I loved the ending as well.  Just great!  I can't wait for Season 5.",1393372800,,233,3.9565217391304346

5492938,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Without question the best series on worldwide television for viewers over 45.  Something about the interface of the class systems continues to fascinate us.  Season four gives us drama to chat about with our dear friends, but with fewer dead bodies around.  A joy to watch and so satisfying on the second viewing.  Worth owning and a great value.",1393372800,,346,4.813559322033898

5492945,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"What can I say?  I loved it, as I have loved all four seasons.  Unfortunately, as I write this, the season has just ended on PBS, and I have to wait 44 more weeks for another ""fix"" of Downton Abbey.  Well, with 4 seasons now on DVDs that I own, I can always go back and watch all the episodes again...and again...and again.....",1393372800,,327,4.158730158730159
5492946,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Great writers and actors.  The settings/locations, costumes, and overall visuals are excellent.  Each season has captivated my interest on so many levels.  I truly hope there will be more seasons in the very near future.  Well Done!!!",1393372800,,234,5.243243243243243
5492947,4,B00AQVMZKQ,This is still a great show but it is getting a little bit more like a regular soap opera. It's hard to come up with new situations to keep the show interesting.,1393372800,2,160,4.03125

5492951,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Amazing show  Very much enjoyed. Shared with friends for them to watch also and to enjoy  Definitely recommend to others.,1393372800,,121,5.0
5492952,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I know there's been a lot of negatively surrounding season 4 of Downton, but if you're a fan, don't give up. Of course we miss Sybil and Matthew, but since the actors chose to leave, there's nothing to be done about it. I believe that the writers did a great job considering that they had to rewrite characters' lives. I do like the addition of what Violet calls ""Mary's men."" Sure, it's a little distasteful that she has three men hanging from the fishing line, but instead of thinking of it that way, enjoy them. The actors do a wonderful job, they're all so handsome, and their characters really do add a nice element to the story (even though we still miss Matthew). My main complaint is what they're doing with Tom Branson (Sybil's husband). Sure, he still misses his wife, and he's lonely, but do they really have to pair up such a great guy with those horrid women. Please, please say that Miss Bunting won't return because I can't stand her character. Rose's childish antics can't compare with Sybil's free spirit, but I'm glad they made her a bit different rather than trying to ""create"" another personality like Sybil's. She brings a little spunk to the show. Mary is the ""cold fish,"" but she's still one of my favorites, and has some great one-liners. Not as great as Violets, but still worth a laugh.

Anyway, rant over. I really do adore this show, and I look forward to season 5. All in all, I believe they're doing a great job considering all the changes.",1393286400,,1470,4.526315789473684
5492953,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Season 3 solidified the Snob Hill Gang in quick drying cement then ended...4 brought in enough real people to keep the cement from stiffening our arteries...We LOVE the family but we're now finding opportunities to like n respect them as they grow from insufferable to victims of a dying breed. The 2nd layer of folks and their strength of character is humanizing the upstairs family and empowering the downstairs family to dream and upgrade their thinking and mobility.,1393286400,,470,5.038461538461538
5492954,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Great!  I watched the whole season in 2 nights! Can't say enough about how exciting this season is and unexpected.,1393286400,,114,4.7
5492955,4,B00AQVMZKQ,The only reason I did not rate it five stars was the disc cover was slightly damaged when I opened the box.  The DVD itself was not damaged so I am enjoying season 4.,1393286400,,166,3.8823529411764706
5492956,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Better than waiting for it to appear on tv. Continues to be a great series. Will wait now for Series 5,1393286400,,102,3.9047619047619047
5492957,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season four is jumpy, characters are hollow and undeveloped.  How many times do we have to hear Barrows ask the new maid Miss Baxter if she has  heard any stories?  How many times do we have to watch Lady Mary reject suitors?  And this whole thing with Edith's beau has been dragged out and gone nowhere fast.  In short, we were hugely disappointed with season 4.  It was far too disjointed, too many ""cuts,"" too little real story line development.  Hope it improves next season.",1393286400,3,479,4.564705882352941
5492958,4,B00AQVMZKQ,This 4th season is just as wonderful and entertaining and surprising as the three preceding seasons.  Have a jolly good time watching it!,1393286400,,137,4.956521739130435

5492960,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I bought from Amazon Season's 1, 2 and 3 separately. I loved them .  Now as I'm looking to buy Season 4 I see the screen format is widescreen.  I hate widescreen.  If a tv show is in full screen format that's what I want when I buy the DVD.  I have a 32 inch Samsung and hate it that a DVD doesn't fill up the if it's widescreen.  None of the first three seasons on DVD were listed as widescreen.  Maybe I won't buy Season 4 and wait for tv repeats to record myself.",1393286400,,466,3.8526315789473684

5492967,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen, best plots, best acting, best costumes and scenery, really the whole thing is magical and romantic beyond words.  But.  This season had a brutal and very real rape scene in episode 2.  If I wanted stuff like that, I could always listen to rap music or watch crime dramas.  Matthew's death didn't bother me, Sybil's death, the episode with the Persian diplomat, all were handled realistically but were not horrible in any way.  I watch this show for the loveliness of it, not to be jarred by gritty and ugly ""real life"".  The writers made a terrible mistake, and I found it traumatic enough to give up on the show for the rest of the season.  So bear in mind when reading this review, it's only for 2 episodes.  I highly recommend the first 3 seasons of Downton, without reservations, but not this one.  Such a shame, it used to be so very, very good.",1393286400,10,896,4.381818181818182

5492973,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I loved this series of family life through  parts of history. Also the effects it had on their servants through time. The loyalty the servants had for the family was amazing. I loved each character @ how they portrayed their parts  The English ways @  the American ways so opposite from each other. Would recommend to my friends a great series,1393286400,,343,4.590163934426229

You should watch it too!!",1393286400,,307,4.7924528301886795
5492981,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This show transports you to another time and place like no other I have seen before.  It is truly a classic.  I could watch each episode over and over.  Season 4 is much more hopeful than Season 3.  It seems we have something to look forward to in Season 5.,1393286400,,257,4.08
5492982,2,B00AQVMZKQ,Loved the first 3 seasons but I do not feel the characters have anything new to offer. Focusing on the women's love lives is boring.  I will continue to watch as I love the show but hoping Season 5 is better.,1393286400,2,208,4.073170731707317

5492995,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The new season lives up to Downton standards. Great new plots and new additions to the cast.

5492996,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"While maybe not the best season of this fine drama, it lives up to the Standard of the others. It is somewhat repetitive in that the Lords have died and the financial future of Downton is again at risk, but carried off splendidly by the writers with a post war twist. Writing is as usual brilliant, as is the acting. I give it five stars purely for meeting it's challenges admirably!",1393286400,,383,4.408450704225352

Not only are the characters interesting, but there is real character development as the series progresses.  Not only do you experience the historical culture as the series moves through time, but you can watch as the characters react to the changes and change themselves.

Even when we have seen the episode on TV,  we enjoy watching it again and pick up on nuances of the conversations and plot that we previously missed.  If anything, the characters played by the servants (Carson, Mrs Hughes, Ann, and Mr. Bates) are often more interesting than those upstairs except for Lady Granthom, played by Maggie Smith.",1393200000,,383,4.7727272727272725
5493006,4,B00AQVMZKQ,I had to watch it twice because so much was going on it was hard to keep up with all 3 million of the plot lines. None of them included the dumb love triangle between the kitchen staff !(thank God) Rose's huge coming out party was unforgettable and added a lightness that has been missing this season. The mystery surrounding bates and ladies maid baxter will keep you wondering who these people really were/are. Sadly they didn't give shirley maclaine much to do but be snarky and wear pretty dresses. Paul Giamatti was a real treat and played the role nothing like I thought he'd be. The ending with two of my favorite characters at the beach will have you smiling long after the credits roll.,1393200000,,695,4.523809523809524

5493052,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I got hooked on the show with season 1.  But if the show had been like it was this season I doubt if I would have watched more than a couple of episodes. Don't read further if you haven't seen the season and don't want to know what happens. First of all, each episode jumps from one scene to another, often within just a matter of a minute or less. Perhaps that's good for a video game, but not for a drama.  Second, some of story lines have become tedious.  We get it, Lady Mary is hot, but to have not one, but two guys after her is not all that interesting, episode after episode. Besides the guys are too similar and actually look too much alike to make me care who actually ""wins Mary.""  Also what was once a delightful relationship between Anna and once charming Bates is now  fraught with Anna's rape and possibly a murder by Bates. Whatever it is that Thomas has over the new lady's maid has also gone on far to long without revealing what it is and the love triangle in the kitchen at most should have been resolved after a few episodes, not for several shows over two seasons.  Finally too much time was given to things like the coming out party of Rose with just a blink about what happened when Edith gave birth to a baby.  Other things are almost ignored also like the two children, who we see maybe twice in the entire season. I will probably continue to watch season 5 because I am curious about what happens, but I also imagine that the show will continue to go downhill until it finally mercifully ends.",1393200000,2,1520,4.275261324041812

5493069,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"The sets are great.  Some of the acting is good.  The depiction of many aristocrats is believable in that they exhibit their naive ignorance of ""real life"".  Is this supposed to be a sociological look at the difference of classes, acceptance of people in an era when there was little acceptance of outsiders?  Is it supposed to be a fairy tale world of people getting along across the barriers of the crippling conventions of the British Empire?  Is it supposed to imply that the favored rich of that world have big hearts and are just ordinary folk who can accept the chauffeur with no demur?  To show how the Americans appeared to underwrite many of the great houses of Britain but were generally still looked down upon for their differences?  Anthony Trollope may have been able to do justice to this group of people, but I think the story as it is goes nowhere.

With all real soap operas too many characters get into the stew as they are introduced to keep the story going,  and then there isn't time to develop anything very deeply.  Too many cameo parts, and no cohesive story.  The last episode was the worst of all, leaving everything up in the air with no resolutions.  Julian Fellowes just seems unable to let go of all this panorama of people moving around, dancing, being presented at court and almost always punctuated by that MUSIC.  Who wrote that theme song?

We are subjected to that putrid music constantly as well as all these unlikely relationships.  Granted there are some stand-out characters such as Maggie Smith and some of the other women, but compare it to the old Upstairs Downstairs where every episode really had some sort of genuine social or political issue and the class thing was so much more in the open?  Or Brideshead Revisited for its ambience.  Both of those works had a beginning middle and end and both of them were well written.

I vote no on Downton Abbey.  I really hoped it would improve, that there would be some actual depth in the story, that something would happen--- but it just floated out on that never ending theme song of sawing violins.",1393113600,5,2091,4.617886178861789

I got this set to be able to do the entire season over a single weekend and relish repeating favorite scenes.  As some one who is widely read in history and history of England between the wars, I was interested to see how they adapted to rapidly changing social climate and it was great to have a new character talking about the decline of landed and titled estates.  I could hope that the series goes up through 1939 like the second edition of Upstairs/Downstairs which I finished watching recently.  The general strike, the depression and rise of Fascism in the '20's and '30's would be fascinating, particularly to see how the family reacts to the political contrasts between Chamberlin and appeasement and Churchill and war preparedness.",1393113600,,833,4.971223021582734

What will happen to Edith and her decision about her baby.  Where will Rose's  mischievous behavior take her, will Mr. Bates be in trouble with the law again, will Mary and Tom save Downton Abbey from financial ruin, what will Mary decide about her two suitors, and will Tom make a political stand.

Carries on the same elements as other shows of this Subject, but does so exceedingly well and without having to resort to violence and sensationalism.

I got so caught up in it that I had my husband buy a new Wi-Fi DVD player so I could catch up to season 4.  The cast and setting are all spectacular.  Can't wait for season 5!,1393113600,,278,3.8421052631578947

What about the baby situation?  Who will Mary choose....hopefully someone not yet introduced.  What is the secret Thomas has over the new ladies made?  Will Mosley be the hero here?

5493091,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It wasn't until around November 2013 that I finally decided to see what all the hoopla was about.  My daughter and daughter-in-law had been raving about this series, so I decided I would start watching the series through Amazon.  Between Thanksgiving and Christmas - actually right up to the time when Season 4 began, I watched all of the episodes for all of the seasons.  I just couldn't stop watching them.  I find the characters in the series to be very interesting, and the writers really make them believable.  I'm happy to see there are also villains and that everything isn't just ""coming up roses"".  I've cried when a main character dies (and even got mad that they were written out of the cast but also realize there must have been other opportunities they wanted to pursue.  The acting in this show is superb.  I thoroughly enjoy every minute of the show and can't wait for the next episode.",1393113600,,901,4.622641509433962

I am current and enjoying the season 4 in TV.

Great show, like the look into the life of both sides the elite, and the servants, and everyone in between.  Plus this show proves once again that it does not matter which level you are at in life, everyone has similar issues.  Some issues have a slightly different twist or flavour, but they tend to be the same.",1393113600,,650,4.134920634920635

5493095,2,B00AQVMZKQ,This 4th series represents a decrease in quality. The characters have become more stereotyped and the issues of the narrative pushed to tiresomeness and a reduction in complexity.,1393113600,3,179,5.428571428571429

5493099,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Its not even fair for me to review Downton Abbey for the fourth season.  It was by far my favorite.  I have been hooked on this from the beginning even before it had what you might call a cult following.  I absolutely love the characters. Even the vilians have provided the needed boo factor.  Putting in Rose as a common man symbol has added a bit of spice to the rather  ""to be expected"" English upper class.  Mary is fantastic and my favorite  character is hard to pick since i think everyone does a wonderful job.  Of course Anna has to rank up there close to everyone's favorite, Maggie Smith.  I hope it goes on for the entirety of at least the second world war.",1393113600,,668,4.28

5493104,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey Season 4 once again delivers with interesting storylines and plot twists. I have been hooked since season one and this did not disappoint. There is definitely more of an air of sadness with this season, not as much light-heartedness as before, but still it has its moments. In this season you get to grow with the characters and find even some development and movement with the downstairs staff.

If you have been watching Downton Abbey since the beginning, you will like this season and should watch, many new avenues for the characters and if you don't watch, you'll be lost in season 5 for sure!",1393113600,,612,4.719626168224299

5493111,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"There has been a lot written already, observing that this 4th Season of Downton Abbey is not up to snuff with previous Seasons.  Some viewers may see it that way and that is their right.  All of life changes, evolves and goes through ups and downs.  Life is a roller-coaster ride  -- ever more-so in the 21st Century.  It is the rare enterprise that can sustain a steady, constant ever upward trajectory.  The characters and the crew of Downton are the same stuff of humanity as the rest of us.  If Season 4 may lack the usual gravitas of what we have to appreciate on Masterpiece Theatre, that may be expected and may not come as a surprise.  It must be said that the novelty of Downton, after three (3) Seasons, may have worn off, and viewers have settled in, and it may be more difficult to surprise us.  Life has a way of being life: there are bills, there are struggles to keep and maintain our homes, there is ill-health and death, there are animals that must be cared for.  And there is the ever-present and continuing human drama, comedy, melodrama, and tumult of all of our lives be we aristocracy or servants or regular white and gray and blue-collar average everyday citizens.  There is a slightly different tone to Season 4, but life, whether fictional or real moves on.  None of us in our best days can maintain the quality of life to which we aspire.  Downton and most of British television, film, theatre, music -- the general cultural array -- still outshines American production and production values year in and year out.  America's cultural contributions to the world are now submitted by addled sophomoric fraternity boys and sorority girls.  As the latest report on American ex-patriots indicates, more and more Americans are looking for the exits.",1393027200,2,1769,4.679611650485437

It seemed a small price to pay to feed my new addiction to go ahead and get Season 4.  Warning labels should be attached letting you know about it's seductive power to suck you into the lives of Downton.  I even speak with a British accent now.

Relax, George, we love it and there is nothing the Republicans can do about that! The production values, in particular

The trouble is, I kept waiting the whole season for something to happen and everything paled in comparison to wars and forbidden marriages.

5493164,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Don't you hate those people, who rush to see the premier of movies, or buy the first-edition of best-selling books, and then are compelled to tell everyone about the plot or the ending?  Me too, but unfortunately I married one of them.

My wife coerced me (she has truly compelling forms of pressure) to purchase the Season 4 DVD of Downton Abbey as soon as it became available.  It arrived about mid-way during the weekly TV presentations.  She had worked herself up to a fever pitch over Mr. Green's sordid assault, and was, by sheer will power, bent on compelling Mr. Bates's revenge.  We had to immediately watch all of the remaining episodes the day the DVD came, and she was temporarily sated.  However, for the next few weeks, at her office, at parties, at stores, over the fence to neighbors, she was enthusiastically ruining the series for everyone interested by divulging all the important events.  She's a sick woman, but I didn't know that when I proposed.

BTW, the series is great - Maggie S. is as wonderfully acerbic and caustic as is Englishly possible.  And, for once, the series ends on a happy note.  Disregard that last sentence If you haven't seen the last episode yet.  I'm not like my wife.",1392940800,,1214,4.652582159624413

i do find mary a bit too stiff in parts this year, a little over the top with aloofness.",1392940800,,375,4.267605633802817
5493167,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was worried that, at this point, the series would have gone stale.  It's so hard for a TV series to remain fresh year after year.  It's even harder when it's a series that is constrained by a certain time period.  If you think about it, the Abbey is somewhat of a prison, as most of the action takes place there.  They are also limited by what happened in history, rather than creating what is or what could be now.

However, I was delighted to find that the series was still interesting and yes, fun.  And some of what I'm going to say may contain spoilers if you haven't watched the third season, and then I am going to discuss some of the plot from this season, so...

SPOILER ALERT!

 Dame Maggie Smith was in her element and stole the show in every scene in which she participated.  She's just so GOOD in this role.  I admire actors who can take on a character who would be so easily hated and make them lovable (such as Alan Rickman with Snape in the Harry Potter movies.)  I loved how kind she was to Lady Edith and to Isobel.

I also enjoyed Penelope Wilton's Isobel, as she beautifully took us through the grieving of her son.  And the interactions between Maggie Smith and her were quite wonderful.

Michelle Dockery continues to amaze me with her restrained performance of Lady Mary.  Every trouble in the world is laid at her feet, and then people wonder why she can be hard as nails?  Can't imagine why!  She also did a great job in conveying her grief over the loss of Matthew.

Finally, Joanne Froggat did a beautiful job in such a difficult performance.  The emotions she portrayed, the way they showed in her face, even the way she held herself...she's truly talented.

If I had some complaints, it would be these (SPOILER ALERT):

1.  Can there be no happiness for long for Mr. and Mrs. Bates?  First he's in jail, now she's raped.  I'm not saying it's not realistic - life can be very hard - but can they have SOME joy?
2.  I'm dying to know Baxter's background.  I can't believe it was not revealed at all.
3.  I couldn't remember what Daisy and Ivy were fighting about and honestly, it was just way too much for too long.
4.  The whole Prince of Wales letter debacle was just, well, stupid.  Felt completely out of place.

Still, great job by the whole cast and the storylines were mostly interesting and enjoyable.

Highly recommend.",1392940800,,2357,4.409302325581395

5493169,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Bought all seasons so far. Can't get enough. This is about the lives of a wealthy family and the struggles of keeping an estate that was passed down from generation to generation. And the changing of the times conflicting with the old traditions. Set in the early 1900's, the clothes and scenery are beautiful.  It sweeps you back in time.",1392940800,,339,4.65
5493170,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"About a year ago I decided to watch the first three Downton Abbey series, which I did over the course of two days. From the first episode I was hooked -- the sets and scenery were sumptuous, the ensemble cast worked well together, and the overall plot depicted a period about which I am most interested.

Several days ago I took time to watch all of the fourth series and I came away feeling the show had become stagnant. In fairness, I decided to view all four series a second time. Again, I loved the first three series but felt series four was running on life support -- I could not bring myself to view it all again.

As a previous reviewer stated, few of the principal characters are evolving, and characters added to the fourth series are little more than wooden cutouts of those they're replacing. The plot arcs are becoming clichd and utterly predictable. Doubtless, I will watch the fifth series, and I do hope Julian Fellows puts it back on track, but I doubt there will be a sixth series, nor should there be.

A couple of side comments:

1. I do hope Amazon can get its collective head out of its arse and deliver streamed programming that isn't constantly interrupted and which, frequently, will not reconnect at all. I do not have this problem with Netflix and I'm very curious why a company with Amazon's resources cannot do a better job.

2. After 50 some odd years of watching television I've really grown tired of relatively unknown actors who find themselves in a highly successful ensemble cast, like Downton Abbey's; then, because of the show's success decide to 'make their mark' in Hollywood, thus destroying the show's continuity, and subsequently never to be heard of again.",1392940800,7,1699,4.65

In addition to that, episode one continues the scheming and condescending Thomas antics along with the pathetic new ladies maid. Aside from the beautiful sets, costumes and music, you have turned an amazing, beautiful glimpse into history into a tawdry soap opera. I realize rape happened, continues to happen, in our world.

SPOILERS..........................SPOILERS.......................SPOILERS......................SPOILERS..............................

There seemed to be some reversion to character traits of earlier seasons, which was unfortunate, since we had seen some development. I don't think it was just being with Matthew that ""changed"" Mary,"" but I had hoped, some maturing through the war, etc. All that is gone, and Mary is completely cold and self absorbed again. Even though Anna was expected to, and did, help her carry Pamuk's dead body to his room so that Mary's secret might be kept, and even though Bates left his job, his security, his happiness, to return to psychowoman, so that Mary's secret might be kept, when Mary was faced with the choice to keep his or not, what did she tell Mrs. Hughes? ""it's a man's life, it's WRONG."" She had no proof that Bates was the killer but was that ready to sell him out. ONLY when Bates yet AGAIN saved her family and the monarchy from another embarrassing scandal did Mary change her mind.  Mary is loyal only to her position. Period. It broke my heart, and Carson's, when she was cruel to him. I am glad he got in the last shot. Nor did she tell Anna or Bates what she had done with the ticket, so Bates has to live in worry.

I thought there were some layers of human complexity in Thomas last season, but that too is all gone. He is back to being ""one note"" evil, causing trouble for everyone for no apparent reason. Additionally, the thing with the Nanny was clunky. He was trying to get her in trouble, but she cooked her own goose when Cora heard what she said to Sybbie, which had nothing to do with Thomas. In contrast, the guy who plays him, from what I have seen in the extra features, seems to be a nice guy. He is good at being bad! I wonder what if it had been Tom who heard Nanny, and what he would have done to her. Sadly, there were probably many many children of ""privilege"" who were at the mercy of nannies and governesses like Nanny West, and even still.

I thought it was too bad that both Robert and Cora seemed to suffer from extreme amnesia this season, to the point of seeming demented. First, when Thomas and Braithwaite were pointing fingers at Anna, saying she was being mean, they believe them, even though they know Anna is the sweetest person ever, and is never mean to anyone! They even speak to Bates about her. Totally wrong. It was the same in the scene where Thomas is complaining to Robert about the other staff and Robert said, ""are you not liked downstairs?"" Never mind that there were incidents of theft and attempts to frame Bates in earlier seasons, and what kind of person Thomas is, which Robert well knows. Amnesia, I say.  Robert and Cora should have laughed Thomas out of the room. Why is he still working there? I was glad Braithwaite got kicked out early on, and loved her smackdown by Mrs. Hughes. Additionally, when Violet was questioning Robert about his wanting total control of the estate, I too was thinking, yeah, because you have done so well with that up til now!""

Now Edith. She seems to present as a sympathetic character for alot of people, but she isn't to me. While Mary is not a nice person, she never did anything to really hurt Edith in the first season, yet what Edith did to her by telling the Turkish guy what happened to Pamuk, would have ruined Mary's entire life, if she had not married Matthew. She would have never married and even worse, have been shut out of the society she lived for. I thought it perfect karmic justice that Edith was jilted at the altar, losing her chance to marry, and now experiencing what would cause equal scandal for her. I wanted her to remember what she did to Mary, but the show didn't go there. I have to say that Cora and Mary were pretty blind to not know Edith was pregnant, since they knew she had a boyfriend,had to have started to show, and suddenly off to Switzerland for months. Stevie Wonder would know. I thought Violet's reaction was great.."" I see I will have to take the slow path"" but not judgmental, nor was she of Sybil and Tom. For all her clinging to the old ways, she was pretty down to earth with her granddaughters and matters of love and sex. It was funny how Robert chastised Dr Clarkson for saying the word ""urine"" in front of her! Tis a mystery what happened to Gregson. If the Nazis killed him, they would have found a body? They didn't have camps yet in 1922 I don't think. has he faked his death? Why would he give Edith his power of attorney?

I didn't like Rose at all. She was a spoiled little rich girl who didn't give a thought to anyone else, but wanted what she wanted. No replacement at all for Sybil, who was a real person, with  brains and a heart. I SO miss Sybil. Matthew was a nice guy but I loved Sybil. I wish that Cora's mother had been there when Sybil was dying. She would have thrown Sir I Know it All out the window, got Sybil to the hospital, and saved her. I absolutely think Dr Clarkson was right and would have saved her, had they listened to him. I agree with Cora, and didn't want her to reconcile with Robert, even though Violet pushed her to. It was completely Robert's and Sir Know it All's fault.

I thought the Daisy/Ivy/Alfred/Jimmy adolescent posturings went on interminably, but Daisy and Mrs Patmore's relationship matured, which was nice to see.

I got really tired of seeing Molesley whining and feeling sorry for himself. I liked how he stood up for Baxter though, helping her to feel better about herself, and hopefully telling Thomas to go jump in the lake. I see a relationship developing there, no matter what she's done.

The pig stuff was dumb. When DID Mary learn to make eggs?

Cora's mother and brother stuff was dumb and unnecessary. Also the cloak and dagger spy stuff in trying to get the letter back. If it was that important, maybe girlfriend shouldn't have had it in her bag and then left her bag unattended!

What was REALLY good...

Anna's storyline, and her acting. She brought it!!! I hope they have British Emmys, she should definitely win. I really wanted her to go to the police after she knew Bates knew though. I thought that she was selling him a bit short for being so sure that he would kill Green, and ruin their lives together. I LOVE Mrs Hughes, she is such a badass! I thought she was going to kill Green with her bare hands, and I bet she could have. Such great scenes with Anna, with Green, with Braithwaite, with Carson. ALL of them. It's such a shock to see her on the show and then how she looks in real life, a decade younger, like Mrs. Patmore. I also love Carson. He is absolutely old school, and is judgmental and rigid and everything else, but it is his job to make sure everything goes right. It was all on his shoulders. He does have a caring heart though. He adores Mary, though I am with Mrs Hughes on that, and I loved the scene with he and Sybbie. One of my favorite scenes was when he had just found out Mrs Hughes was okay, and he was singing and laughing while he polished the platter, so unlike him, but so sweet. The final scene of this season is right up there too, with Carson in BARE feet, wading, and holding Mrs. Hughes' hand for security! Others think they should be married, I don't know, but even if not, their friendship is wonderful to see.

I don't think Bates is the killer. It would take alot of things to fall into place to take the train to another town, rent a car, find where the guy lives, follow him to where you would be able to hit him, with no one seeing it, or you, then returning the car and getting back on the train. It is possible he had someone else do it, but they would have the same problems. He was hit by a car right?  I think it was an accident. I wanted someone to kill him, but slowly. I can only imagine how many victims he had. As vulnerable as women have always been to sexual assault, I feel sure that women and girls in service positions were especially easy to victimize.

Tom matured this season, I thought. I didn't like him when he was with Sybil. He was controlling, willing to let her sacrifice everything in her life for him but gave up nothing for her,not wanting her to ""disappoint him"" I hated that, or to have ideas about their child that disagreed with his, and not even treating her family with the slightest respect, when they were sheltering him and even keeping his ass out of prison. I understood and agree with where he was coming from but he could have given Sybil that much. He was a jerk but did start to grow up after Sybil's death.  I think maturity involves the ability to not only see your corner, but the other guy's as well, including the English, and he was getting there. It was such irony to see him dancing at the ball with monarchy. I wonder if the ""troubles"" are going to rear their head again next season, since one of the guys after Mary has a castle and holdings in Ulster, which I believe is in Northern Ireland. How would Tom deal with Mary becoming an occupier?

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dame Maggie Smith. I love her snarkiness and her wisdom.  Her scenes with Isobel were gold. It was well done how Isobel could have gladly strangled her, yet when Violet was ill, wouldn't leave her side. Even sick, Violet had good lines! The scene where they are playing cards and having fun together is great. I had a sad moment though, in seeing her ill scenes, to realize she is nearly eighty years old. She is a treasure, and always will be.

This show is a treasure as well, even with all its faults. It has stellar performances and often excellent writing. I don't compare it in any way with Upstairs Downstairs. This is its own entity, and it is awesome to see how many people around the world love this show.",1392854400,3,10014,4.39870340356564

5493263,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is without doubt the best TV series being produced today. This show has a worldwide audience well over a 100 million people. I have purchased every episode from Amazon instant videos. It has been said that you cannot produce quality television programming, because only a few people will watch it. Not true! There are millions of people around the world who crave quality programming. The season has between seven and nine episodes--usually nine. Season five is being filmed right now.

It is so good that it has a cult  following all around the world. I tend to judge my friends and acquaintances by whether or not they watch Downton Abbey--that is if they have seen the show and know about it! It was the middle of the third season before I was able to get my wife to start watching. Now she is more of a Downton fanatic then I am. We watch all the current episodes together and now we are going back and watching each episode from the very beginning together! Now Amazon is selling some of the jewelry and clothing and other items that are Downton related. There are several hardback books that can be purchased from Amazon, as well as some of them in e-book format. The Hardback books have some of the greatest photography that I've ever seen in a book.

If you have an Amazon prime membership you can watch all the episodes for free, or you can purchase any or all of the episodes for $1.99, or  an entire season for a little bit less. It is so much fun to be able to watch such a great program together with your spouse and/or your friends. I would give it 10 stars if that was possible!",1392854400,,1607,4.437288135593221

(3) Feminism: watch a woman be told by her daddy that she is an idiot and cant know how to manage a farm, after which we hear feminist cheering (years before feminism arrived!) of hes afraid of a woman taking charge  shes a victim of a culture who won't allow her gender to be in a leadership position

The men are portrayed as incompetent boobs (Marys men fighting over an ungrateful spoiled wench single mom, Robert portrayed as a greedy uncaring dad, Carson portrayed as the uptight sot, etc).

The only men spared this anguish? Victim men: Thomas the gay victim, Bates the disabled & wrongfully accused victim, Mosley the penniless victim and Branson the social class victim

Welcome to Downton Abbey  where victims flourish and everyone else crashes and burns.",1392768000,3,1152,4.536231884057971

As it covers the early 1900s, I am amazed at the class separation, and yet, it is presented as very believable.  Job well done.  I had saved the series on DVD and then deleted it without watching because time.  I have purchased the series and watched it on my  new Kindle Fire.

When they arrived and I started watching them I realized that they are not the same version that is broadcast in the US. In the UK they have commercial breaks and we do not on our PBS.  I find it hard to believe that in this day and age a complete version of the program is not for sale. I will record this series from the cable ondemand and probably never watch this dvd set again.

Characters we can love or hate, belittle or praise, actions and reactions we can condemn or condone.

There is not a character in this show I don't like, even Thomas Barrow, he is someone you love to hate! Oh and don't get me started on Violet Crawely (Maggie Smith), she is hysterical!

5493329,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"One thing that I found odd Elizabeth Mcgovern was mostly absent from this season, she had more of a role in the last 2 episodes but that was mostly it, you did see her in other episodes but they where VERY Short scenes.  I do not know if it has her schedule clashing or the writers.
  Anyway this season like the others is Good!!!  It take places just a few months after the 3rd left off, they split this season fairly even with staff story lines and the Family of the house story lines.  The staff story part was way better then family part drama story.
BD audio stereo again and has a flat sound to it.  BD video is exactly like the other seasons with rich color, fine detail but not great.",1392681600,,692,4.165413533834586

The look on Bates face when he realized who the rapist was, was brillilant.  Mary beginning to come to life again is also exciting.  Cora is still beautiful, but her demure expression is too repetitious.",1392681600,,338,5.109090909090909

They came back to me saying that it was because of my machine.  I have been watching dvd's on the same machine and they worked just fine. They then told me that some dvd made for the UK do not show colour unless you have a special machine that works for both countries. I asked for a return number so I could return the dvd.  The answer was simply Sorry! no return possible since it was opened.  How can I have known that this was the problem before I opened it since I never had this problem before?

5493348,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Plot is brilliant and the characters are engrossing. Yes, it's period melodrama, but the quality of Downton Abbey has broken all the molds. How does Jullian Fellows do it???? One knows it will not end well with WWII in the offing and economic doom for large estates unavoidable, despite the promise of pig farming and cattle herding at Downton.  The irony is that being a rich aristocrat does not make one immune from life's most perplexing problems.  Does the name of the estate ""Downton"" suggest that eventually events will begin dragging them ""Down""?

5493356,2,B00AQVMZKQ,Am a huge fan of the first 3 seasons but this one is disappointing. Feels more like quantity than quality with storylines. Bounces around like a daytime soap opera and we know what has happened to most of those.  They're gone due to low ratings.,1392681600,3,245,4.444444444444445

5493364,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"When I received multiple e-mails about ordering Season 4 of Downton Abbey.  It stated that it was being sold at it's lowest price, if ordered by a certain date.  I knew I would want it for my collection as well as my friend's.  I did not need it before the season ended, as a matter of fact I did not even watch it in advance.  I ordered it because I said if this is going to be the lowest price, I will order it now.  One for me and a gift for my friend.  Two weeks later, I wanted to order Seasons 1,2,3 and 4, as a donation to a fundraising auction at my school, being held March 6.  I was surprised, very surprised, to see the price a bit lower for Season 4 than I had paid for the 2 that I had ordered.  It angered me.  I will never again be fooled by your promotions or ""sales"".  It was not because the season had ended, as it is still being aired.  I would love anexplanation, a refund, or even a donation of some type for the auction I am working on.  I am sure I will get none of those things.",1392681600,,1002,3.8817733990147785

5493368,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I dare say that this season is the weakest of the four seasons of this show. I missed the writ of old lady Grantham Violet, characters really got weaker and plot seem to have stretch thin. I don't know if this season will continue but I do say that it didn't leave me with the urge to look forward to next season. Well, come to think of it maybe about Edith but otherwise, this was a very lack luster season. Granted the exotic places this season has a lot to desire from the first three.",1392595200,2,488,4.147368421052631
5493369,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"Even though Amazon sold this as Blu-Ray, and the DVD package says ""Blu-Ray"" at the top, the picture quality is far below what I see on PBS. Reading the back of the package it claims to be ""HD 1080i"" but it looks more like 720p.
Second, there is no Surround Sound, as there is on the PBS Broadcast! It's Stereo!
Even though my Blu-Ray player identifies the sound as ""DTS-HD Master,"" there are only two channels (L&R). So if I want surround sound in my home theater my receiver has to emulate a surround mode.
So, if you want HD video and 5.1 Surround, watch or record the PBS shows.

5493387,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Love Maggie Smith, this is why I continued to follow this series.  Felt Shirley McClain's acting was crude and not really representative of an American woman of that Era. I also didn't like the political overtones that Fellows  injected with the  mention of theTea Pot Dome Scandal. A direct smack at the Republicans and big oil, no doubt.

Like so many we watch ""with"" our friends and family who are all over the country.  Always a Monday phonecall to say ""I did not see that coming"".  What fun.  I will say that I am not watching Season 4 ahead of time because I want to be as surprised as my fellow watchers.  I have each of the four series and watched the first three to refresh on what was happening before Season 4 was aired.  Love it.",1392595200,,524,4.088235294117647

5493390,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"The angle of this particular knock-off of Pride and Prejudice is that the Bennet sisters take on the social status and manners of the Bingleys.  The character who most resembles the Liza we remember is Matthew, in a thoroughly modern gender reversal.  Don't fear for Mr. Darcy's character, however; successors abound.

Alternatively, Downton Abbey may of course be viewed as an Upstairs, Downstairs knock-off, with Matthew and Lady Mary acting out the back-story of Richard Bellamy and Lady Marjorie.  In place of Jean Marsh's relatively spare, grown-up world of London and a professionally active head of household, Downton Abbey adopts as its principal character the consumer values of the house itself, with its decor, furnishings, table settings, and grounds (and of course the costumes and hair styles).  Perhaps it's a case of ""Upstairs, Downstairs Meets The Age of Innocence.""  The production values are obviously very high.

In any case, what's really new is that the action of Downton Abbey comprises about 13 -- or is it 30? -- sub-plots running simultaneously.  The cutting is fast and furious, as if it needs to get each scene in before the next tweet hits the audience's smart phone.

One aspect that has been a little surprising to me is that, for a work with an atmosphere that is predominantly humane, the bodies do pile up, don't they?  I don't think they're trying to be Shakespearian; it's just that no one has tenure any more -- everyone's an adjunct.

Downton's realization that Ireland exists ensures its fourth star.",1392595200,,1539,5.019685039370079

I suppose this is a fairly accurate interpretation of royalty in  the 1920s but some of the characters seem on the verge of being too modern. The rape scene and wicked pregnancies add luster to to the show but in the end it is a pure soap and nothing can save it from trite plot lines not even the gorgeous sets, clothing, palaces, cars, etc. I will continue to watch just so I can feel superior ...",1392595200,,564,4.271028037383178

These seem to be dragging a bit, but who can resist all the glitter, the make-up, the hoopla of a generation or a world most of us cannot even imagine.  As for me, I'll go down to the servant's kitchen and drink with the heart of the castle before I retire quietly in the drawing room and listen to some high pitched daughter in a gown that has never been wrinkled sing a very tiring piece of music that would put even the hound to sleep. It's worth it, if you can stand the painful articulation. Never mind that no one blinks.  Long live Maggie Smith!",1392508800,,679,4.322834645669292

One of the characters, Daisy, is continually upset that some particular boy doesn't like her.  Meanwhile, some other boy is entranced with her... but she is only interested in the guy who doesn't like her.  This would be more entertaining if there was any reason for anyone to like Daisy-- but there isn't.  She's a shallow, selfish character.  I am no longer paying money to listen to her complain about how some guy doesn't like her.  There are better things on televsion.

Other reviews are full of details about characters and plot and are easy to find and read online, but I just wanted to get the idea across that this is a high-quality show with great attention to period details. Although I would like for the series to continue past season 4, I also want the series to end on a high, rather than like some series which last too long and become less compelling or even worse: you become less interested in the fate of the characters.

5493420,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"If you are a fan of Jane Austen, the Brontes, and classic love stories, then Downton Abbey is the show for you. Based on a book about a maid in a large household in this time period, as well as Upstairs Downstairs, the classic BBC show, Downton Abbey takes you into the lives of the Earl of Grantham and his family, as well as the staff that work at the Abbey. My husband calls it a period soap opera, and while there is quite a bit of drama, it doesn't quite have the falseness that a soap opera would. You get attached to the characters though, and when something happens to them that you don't like, or don't foresee, you really feel for them. Downton Abbey is great overall.

There were a few things in this season that I really was not happy with, but they did a great job with tying up the issues in a way that left me satisfied. There are two big things in this season that even today are considered controversial, and one is hard to watch. I won't spoil it and say what they are, but you'll know what's going to happen just before it does, so, you can skip over that if it's too much.",1392508800,,1092,4.150943396226415

5493430,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I chose this rating because I could sit and watch this over and over again.  I just love these period movies and I think all of us that are in love with Downton love the play of the people downstairs as opposed to the ones upstairs and the interactions between the two.  The story line is interesting and entertaining. I have passed the Seasons on to older folk who live alone and it has been wonderful for them as they can relate and also to the younger generation who knew nothing of the life in the early 1900s and find it educational and amusing!  Looking forward to Season 5.,1392422400,,580,4.302752293577981

5493461,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I bought this because the price was better than other web sites.  However, when you open the package, in addition to Carnival, Masterpiece and PBS, NBC Universal is listed on the DVD disks.  My previous 3 seasons did not have the NBC Universal credit.  As you watch the series on PBS, then view the DVD for each episode, it is obvious that some scenes were edited out.  I just verified that by watching the current episode on-line.  So, be careful if you want the ""real"" version.  This is an edited version with some scenes left out.",1392422400,,533,4.5

Well, in the words of my sister, she is always right and she was in this instance.  I was bored watching most of the episodes in this season and my mind would start wandering.  I've seen a lot of the episodes twice because I re-watched them with my sister and she felt the same way.

I hope they end with season 5 because it is starting to become boring and if they don't I'm afraid it will ruin the entire series for me.  I wouldn't say they have 'jumped the shark' yet though but they are getting pretty close.",1392422400,2,692,4.134328358208955

Costumes, hairdos are so appropriate and beautiful.  I also so enjoy the interaction of the servants.  Always a little intrigue.  I recommend this series very highly.",1392336000,,326,5.173076923076923
5493471,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is a great series.  I love the concept a following changes in social trends while being connected to the inner workings of a family.  There are some changes in season 4, some of which I don't particularly love.  However, this season, although maybe not quite as engaging as the previous 3, is still strong and definitely worth the watch.",1392336000,,351,4.721311475409836
5493472,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"No Spoilers. Why does everyone I know love Downton Abbey? When I ask the question, no one has a real answer.  For myself, I don't know either but I am enamored with it.  Season 4 introduces new characters and they are completely in sync with the existing cast.  It always amazes me that there are so many characters and so many stories held within each episode.  Season 4 does not disappoint.  We find ourselves in the thrust of the economic times and how the ""House"" is going to continue its survival.  Mary's spirit leads the House into times that ""stirs the pot."" I was hoping for a larger role for Tom this year but with so many characters, Tom's character continues to be stand-up-able. Edith, who previously has shown less characterization, has actually had more substance than previously and I believe that her story line will be extremely interesting for next season.  I really loved Season 4 but it seemed that it had difficulty in picking up the pace as well as creating the enthralling dimensionality that we have all enjoyed through the first 3 seasons.  Truth is that one of season 4's greatest accomplishments have been the continued growth of each cast member.  I really like the aspect of age.  We get to see Sibby and George through the generations to Grandmama.  The introduction of Americans in the script is so much fun and I so enjoy the quipping between the English and the Americans.  Also the bickering and challenges between Violet Crawley and Isobel Crawley is fun and really makes the quality and honesty of the family work some how.  I have been told that others just don't like TV about rich people.  I always chuckle because it simply isn't about the rich, it is simply about life in the 1920s.  Some of the most heart felt story lines are based on the staff.  I feel that the staff and the Crawleys are an inter-changeable family. Season 4 is Excellent and Fun to watch on Amazon Prime. It was interesting this season because I was able to seen the entire Season 4 in January.  Where on regular TV, it won't be completed until sometime in February. That was a great perk!",1392336000,,2102,4.592493297587131

I've  loved almost every minute of the first three seasons and forgave Fellows for any odd plot twists that were more silly than entertaining.  I even sat through Shirley Mc Cleens (sp?)  awful crooning in season Three and have forgiven the actors who played Sybil and Matthew for leaving the show.  I am still smarting over Mrs. O'Brien's departure I must admit.  However Season Four is a slow moving train.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but sadly Swamp People and Pawn Stars are starting to look like a bit more entertaining.

Then there are some life choices in there that would be hard issues for children to understand. My friends and I have enjoyed the series, they got me to watching on PBS. I ordered the three sets of DVDs to catch up, then had to have this one too. Just not enough weeks in a set since I am so hooked on the characters, scenes that I need more, hard to wait on the next season.

5493531,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Even with all the rave reviews everywhere, I avoided this show until now, early 2014.  What could a bunch of stuffy upper-crusters from another time possibly have to offer?  Especially after the glorious ending to the inglorious Walter White on Breaking Bad, I was sure this one would be a snoozefest.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong!

From the very first frame, this show draws you into the rarefied world of the landed aristocracy of pre-WWI England, and darned if it doesn't just hook you!  While the elegant Crawley family maneuvers to preserve its social standing and financial future upstairs, a small army of assorted servants bustles about downstairs, keeping it all pristine and orderly. Every character is carefully drawn and superbly acted.  And despite all the conniving and spying and betrayal, you find yourself growing fond of these characters, waiting impatiently for the next episode to see what happens to them.

It doesn't hurt that the castle where all this takes place is breathtakingly gorgeous.  Plus, there's Maggie Smith!  Hands down, the absolute BEST Snooty Old Bat, ever!  She's the most judgy, sarcastic, acid-tongued and hilarious matriarch on TV, and you'll love her!

Go ahead, watch one episode.  I dare you to stop!",1392249600,,1256,5.073170731707317

5493541,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was not a big fan of Downton when it first appeared on PBS, but finally sat and watched it from the beginning and decided Maggie Smith's character made it sooooo worthwhile, as well as Anna and Bates (loved him in 'Larkrise' series). So when they 'killed' Matthew off last season, I wanted to see how they would bail themselves out. Julien (writer) did a decent job, and I love the scenery. Not so thrilled with the solution to Matthew's death, but I guess when an actor quits a show, they have to do something. So I bought the DVD, since PBS was not going to start this season right away.",1392163200,,591,4.333333333333333

5493543,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"My wife and I looked forward to Season 4 with great anticipation, and at first blush we were not disappointed.  We have the same richly textured character interest and the same superb production and acting.  However, we can't avoid a feeling of disappointment as some of the plot lines have slipped into cliches and political correctness. Indeed we have a sense that we have descended into a rather ordinary soap opera, overlaid with our post modern norms and mores.  Whereas the Thomas gay plot line had been handled with sophistication and realism, we now need to be hit over the head with the obligatory racial bigotry bit.  Oh please, we know all about it.  But why include the racial sub plot while ignoring the Irish rebellion that was ongoing at the time?  It is 1922 after all, and the Branson character is portrayed as sensitive to the plight of the Irish worker and workers generally.  While I am at it, it seems that the Branson character's continual playing of Hamlet about his true allegiances has become trite and tiresome in the 4th season.  And along with the racial plot line, we have the equally hackneyed rape story line that hits us over the head yet again by telling us how difficult it was for a poor working girl to deal with a violent sexual attack by someone in a superior social position.

Summing up, the series is still well worth watching for its sparkling performances by many of the cast (the interplay between Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton is pure pleasure), but be prepared for an overlay of post modern cliches that take much of the luster off the goings on.",1392163200,3,1595,4.647686832740214

5493565,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"We have been watching the series from the beginning with great enjoyment.  The acting has been excellent.  But this week I had an epiphany: these people are pampered and useless. They treat their staff nicely---like pets. Their sense of entitlement is so out of touch with justice that is borders on the psychotic.  Britain should have eliminated the aristocracy prior to WWI; perhaps if all Europe had done so, the Great War would have been prevented.  Why are Americans so enamored with this series?  What does that say about us?  Do the viewers secretly harbor a desire to be pampered by servants?  Do we feel entitled to live in wealth while ordinary people struggle?  Maybe the Russians had the right idea: they stood the aristocracy up against a wall and shot them.  The French, of course, had a more incisive method for dealing with them.  I advocate a boycott of the series.  All red-blooded Americans should refuse to watch any more British shows that glorify the upper crust. The Brits have produced plenty of good series that are cynical about their class system.  There is no reason to support Downton Abbey.  Why do they live in an abbey anyway?",1392163200,2,1158,4.758793969849246

It started many new avenues of interest for each character, and it just kept building and building and building, but then left me hanging with many areas unresolved. I am very nervous about the situation with Mr.. Barrow and Tom and how negatively that will affect Tom.  I really want Tom to find some happiness with the family and in his life. Then again, hitting up Bates in a possible bad light as a result of Anna's situation, my jury is out on this tale.  I don't want another long trial and to have their happy situation destroyed. Then there are all the possibilities for Mary that are very interesting and scary at the same time because Michael and Tony are both pretty good and strong characters for Mary.  I see Michael winning out, because of his impending wealth, and also his great sense of challenge for keeping Mary on her toes.  He seems the better fit for her, but yet I feel their is more about him that we do not know yet! Lady Edith... I have no idea how to interpret her situation yet!

Michelle Dockery and Laura Carmichael as Lady Mary and Lady Edith deserve the best actor nods this season; their performances were wonderful.  I was very disappointed though, with the material they gave to the character of Thomas.  It seems as though all he did was pop up time and again just to be nasty.

This edition featured the subtitles in a much smaller print than previous seasons of Downton Abbey, and the print was in yellow, which I found to be  too distracting. I don't know if this is a characteristic of the Blu-Ray edition.

I gave it away and ordered the regular (non blu-ray edition), and the subtitles are the usual format and in white.

I'm also puzzled by this set which says it is the U.K. edition, but I could swear that some scenes were cut.  I remember seeing some scenes on tv series that are not on this dvd edition.",1391990400,,592,4.444444444444445

Must love Brits and the humour of Dame Maggie. I could watch until Sybbie has grandchildren.  The series will be better watched from the beginning. It's a trip worth taking.",1391990400,,324,4.4576271186440675
5493615,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"First the bad:
As an American I have always hated the way that this series portrays Americans. Why does British tv always pick actors with the worst American accents? They make us sound so odd. And why do we always have to be loud, obnoxious, wide eyed, eager, big mouthed, rude, and effusive? Are we single dimensional?

Shirley McClaine only appears in the last episode, but the banter between her character and Violet is stale. It was funny the first time. Now they both just look like harpies.

This season moves really fast compared to previous ones. It's bam, bam, bam! This one's in, now she's out. This happens and then it's over. While the pace of previous seasons seemed slow before, now it seems to fit because those were slower times. Maybe that is why they've sped things up. It feel jarring.

The good:
Basically what is good about it is all the things that we all liked before. There are the spectacular costumes, acting, sets, and historical backdrops. The characters are still interesting. I feel they have replaced breadth for depth, but they are still good. The stories are fresh. You can see how prosperity is returning after the war. I liked the attention paid to Branson's evolution. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. The competition for Mary is also interesting. I thought the pacing for that was good. The final episode was definitely a show stopper. Very grand.",1391990400,3,1402,4.714285714285714

5493642,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"This round started out with O'Brien's abrupt, middle of the night departure (although I guess a hint of the possibility was given in the season 3 ""special""). As of tonight I've watched PBS through part 6 and the rest on DVD- it all looks good. Some have complained about the writing or some of the story bits- you do get some surprises  but most viewers will think the Downton standard isn't slipping.
Thomas Barrow is his old self again, Daisy & Ivy upset over Alfred, Bates turns out to be a most interesting character as a result of his time in prison (he's able to help Lord Grantham save the monarchy from embarrassment)- he and Anna have a violent storyline that may still be around next season. Mary still grieves over her loss of Matthew but ends up with 3 new suitors while Edith, poor girl, is still unlucky in love ( I'll be interested in seeing how that works out- that one will be difficult). Roseis Rose, She never really tames down.
I loved the new locations and vehicles used, even a street scene outside Buckingham Palace (very impressive effort though I'm sure it wasn't used for interior shots which still looked good).
My biggest irritations are actually very minor- Lady Cora told Mrs. Patmore they were getting a new electric refrigerator (this was soon after the new electric mixer) - never saw /heard mention of it again. I'd have liked to have seen little Sybil and baby George more too-  they didn't get 10 minutes screen time between them the whole season!

You do get the season 4 finale, ""The London Season"", with this set so don't go buying it separately.

3 very good extras are included; ""Downton Diaries"", ""The Making of"" and ""Meet the new cast"" (some of them)- all worthwhile. I'm always suprised at how much a wig or hairstyle can change a persons appearance  and ""behind the scenes bits are always good.

If you could preorder 5th season this early I don't think you'd be taking too big a risk about viewing quality, 1-4 are that good.",1391904000,2,1971,4.5852272727272725

5493647,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Oh the intrigue and the plot twists - this is the best season yet and leaves us hanging for the next.  Season three ended on a flat note with the untimely demise of Matthew and the previous passing of Lady Sybil.  Season four opens with everyone moving on in their relationships and the brave new world of post WWI England.  Both above and below stairs relationships become deliciously complicated with some crossing the barriers between the staff and the noble family members.  Lady Edith, a previously neglected and somewhat insipid character, comes into her own as an interesting and evolved member of the family.  Mary attracts numerous suitors and is able to string them along with elegance and detachment.  The Dowager Countess, played magnificently by Maggie Smith, is given and delivers some the most delicious zinger lines ever and is well matched in the verbal ping pong match with the virtuous and iron willed Mrs Crawley.  The season ends, sadly so, leaving us on the edge of our chairs waiting for the next breathtaking installments.",1391904000,2,1046,4.942857142857143

When I finally saw it, I was not disappointed.  That episode only added to my questions about what might happen in the future.  Mary was so sassy with the visiting gentleman (we know what that means) and Anna is still struggling with her situation knowing Mr. Bates is silently plotting as to what to do when he discovers who raped his loving wife - well, I think we know what he will do!  Then there are the conniving servants.  Oh, ""the plot thickens.""  Can't wait for the next episode tonight.

5493665,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm not fully finished with season 4 yet but it remains pretty much as interesting as season one.
""Original UK edition"" means that it is uncut and not interrupted by commercials, but yes, if you
bought it in the States (like on Amazon) then it will play on North American format players.  I
got the Blu-Ray edition and WHY NOT, when some of the best aspects of this series are the
stunningly beautiful interiors and costumes?  Also the countryside scenes--all these things
shine better in higher definition (while of course close-ups of faces show more blemishes).

What, bad people don't get dismissed from service?  Gee I've never heard of that happening
in REAL LIFE!  What--people believe malicious gossip?  I never heard of that either!

Besides the costumes, the interiors and the scenery, what keeps the series interesting is
a combination of two things: A portrayal of how the after-effects of World War I devastated
the old English nobility, and rather realistic portrayals of people, the ""good"" ones having their
faults, and the ""bad"" ones having their positive features as well.  In short, it has a lot that
resonates with real life, but all with a grander setting.

Did I mention the acting remains superb?  And thankfully there are subtitles for those who
have a hard time following everything by soundtrack.  There are about 30 minutes of
""bonus features"" on the DVD / Blu-Ray.",1391817600,2,1391,4.927038626609442

5493668,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I loved everything about season 4 of Downton Abbey. The drama, writing, locations, costumes and especially the great English characters! Downton just may be the best drama ever. It is a shame that American actors aren't more than just celebrities; the English actors are sooooooo much better. Everyone I know loves this series.",1391817600,,327,5.188679245283019
5493669,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"As I predicted, the series ""Jumped the Shark"" after the main character, Matthew Crawley, was killed off.  Main plot for three seasons was Mary and Matthew (Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens had huge chemistry).  Now the plots are getting boring (Ivy, James, Alfred, Daisy=BORING!!!) .  A series ""Jumps the Shark"" when ""long-lost relatives"" are added on (Cousin Oliver on Brady Bunch, cousins on Happy Days, cousins and long-lost siblings on Little House on the Prairie, original Beverly Hills 90210).  There was no reason to add Cousin Rose to Downton, when Julian Fellowes could have focused his attention on Mary, Branson and particularly Edith and her relationship with Gregson.  I wanted to see Edith become a famous writer.  The addition of the black character is weak.  The rape of Anna and how it is resolved is extremely disappointing.  Mary's suitor Blake (Julian Ovenden) is poor casting, as the actor is 4 inches shorter than Michelle Dockery (Mary) and it's very awkward.  Three men, all good looking and rich, in their mid to late 30s still single after ""The Great War,"" is unrealistic. The dialogue was terrible ""Mary, you fill my head up!""  Please!!!  Edith's baby mess was ridiculous.  Elizabeth McGovern's acting has gotten so much worse (look at her face when Anna and Bates run into her at a restaurant).  Finally, Branson's school teacher lady friend is about 4'9 inches tall and annoying. The camera angle when Isobel and Branson are talking to her is ridiculous.",1391817600,,1483,5.004081632653061
5493670,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I got hooked on Downton Abbey when I watched Season 1 through 3 on Amazon Prime (which by the way I love much more than netflix).  I missed the first 2 episodes on PBS and they were not repeating anytime soon so I needed my fix so to speak.  So I bought the first two episodes and very much worth the $1.99 each.  If you like period pieces you will love this show!,1391817600,2,364,3.958904109589041
5493671,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is a wonderful show!  It's such an engaging look at English aristocracy and the sometimes overlooked lives of the very human household staff. Well done!,1391817600,,157,5.038461538461538

5493676,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The story line is great, the actors are great, I could watch forever, please  let it continue, Thanks so much for this series",1391817600,,125,4.434782608695652
5493677,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"The series is still wonderful, and I will continue to watch it (for a while longer, at least), but with Matthew and O'Brien gone it just doesn't have the same appeal to me.  Anna getting raped was very disturbing, and I'm not sure it was a good move when there are other directions the show could have gone in to create a dramatic situation. I understand rape is unfortunately  a fact of life, but I was not happy it was included in Downton Abbey, especially in that day and age when help for a rape victim was mediocre, at best. Also, I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief when Carson's old buddy shows up again and moves in with Isobel because Mrs. Hughes takes it upon herself to befriend him and orchestrate his salvation. Really? Cora's one-dimensional character is beginning to grate on my nerves. For example, when Branson's seducer, the former house maid Edna returns, gullible Cora hires her on the spot as her lady's maid, based upon the fact she had been employed by Downton previously for about three days before she was bounced by Mrs. Hughes. Edna has little if any experience as a lady's maid and was the only applicant, but 18 year old Rose likes her and encourages Cora to give her a try. Now there's a reliable source when considering who to hire as your closest personal employee! However, Mrs. Hughes, Carson, and Branson agree they simply can't tell poor Cora about Edna's inappropriate behavior toward Branson when she worked in the house before, because Mrs. Hughes did write her a good reference when she left (at Branson's request). They fear if they told gentle Cora the truth about Edna, Her Ladyship might come down with the ""vapors"" and need a smelling salt, or something! Please!  Robert, although I do like him basically, can be too much of a snobby prig for words...has he totally forgotten he would have lost Downton because of his really bad investment if Matthew hadn't come to the rescue?  Now at times he doesn't have the insight, humility, or willingness to listen to others who have excellent suggestions on how to profitably run the estate.  Mary and the Dowager Countess are the only interesting and multifaceted characters left, in large part because of their superb acting and excellent writers. I also think Isobel adds a lot to the show with her terrific acting skills and interactions with the Dowager Countess.  I also love Daisy, and hope they build some story lines around her other than her mooning over Alfred. Thomas is always terrific fun to watch, as his mischievous ploys downstairs and upstairs are usually wickedly delicious. If Mary and her British grandmother go the show is doomed. I love Shirley MacLaine, but her stiff portrayal of Cora's mother is dull and adds nothing. In my opinion, continuing with the deeper progression into Edith's struggles, relationships, and activities is the way to proceed with this character. I enjoy watching this great actress work, and more of her would be most welcome. Some of the most captivating episodes to come will hopefully revolve around who Mary becomes romantically involved with...that's worth continuing to tune in for at least a while longer. I realize this series takes place in a different place, time, and social class than 21st century America, and overall I feel it is a wonderfully researched, written, and acted series that I have enjoyed tremendously.  In conclusion, I believe the quality and direction of the first four episodes I've watched of Season Four do not rise to the level of the first three seasons.  However, I suppose I'm still mourning the loss of Matthew, Lady Sybil, and the complex O'Brien. I truly hope Season Four will ""settle in,"" and the compass of excellence will be regained.",1391817600,6,3722,4.81377151799687

5493680,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"In spite of one totally and completely unnecessary plot development regarding Anna Bates (I would ask Julian Fellowes what the hell he was doing!!!???), this 4th season of Downton has been masterfully done!  We're all able to mourn Matthew and allow both Mary and Isobel time to heal and begin to live again.  Many people seem to dislike Rose but I like her quite a lot.  She has a lot to overcome with regard to the bitter relationship with her mother but it is my greatest hope that she will continue to grow and become a lovely person indeed.  She hasn't got Sybil's sweetness but she does have some of her spirit.  I love Tom more than ever and hope that season 5 will bring him good things indeed.  Violet is still a treat as is Cora.  I wish Thomas' redemption had continued more fully...and I hope Julian Fellowes will consider allowing Thomas to redeem himself.  All in all, this is a very satisfying series with only a few hiccups along the way.  And I do highly recommend it if you've loved Downton Abbey so far!",1391817600,,1022,4.451612903225806

5493723,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"The continuation of Julian Fellowes masterpiece has been downgraded to tragic mediocrity.  His opening chapters have served as quick explanations for the death of Matthew, the loss of O'Brien, the treachery of Thomas, the blindness of Cora, and the ineptness of Robert.  It has also reached into the private cubbies of the faithful viewers to crush their carefully created perceptions and beliefs about those remaining characters that have so boldly taken up residence in our hearts.  Fellowes has torn us from that intangible fabric that I describe as character continuity.  Without it, the viewer becomes lost in an aimless sea of change.  What made Downton Abbey different was the viewers ability to count on the responses of the remaining characters to reasonable crisis.  The launch of season 4 has destroyed that expectation.  Fellowes failed to fully take us, the fans, into his many considerations as he dealt with the troublesome issues of cast mutiny and other more mundane production issues.  The result is mediocrity, and in my opinion, unrecoverable fan alienation.  That is not to say the show will fail, on the contrary, I think it will succeed, but with a very different viewer base.  Those of us who have made it a viewing hit have been ""kicked to the curb"".  I suppose that is the way of things, but I cannot in good conscience let such a flagrant disregard for the feelings of those who ""brung you to the dance"" go without a protesting word.

The launch of season 4 indicates that Fellowes has repositioned the series.  It is no longer in the category of a masterpiece classic, but in the genre of a soap opera styled period tragedy.  It has lost the spark of differentiation that pushed it to masterpiece status and has been relegated to idiotic inconsistencies and unbelievable situations.  Come on Julian you can do better than that!

Lady Rose MacClare has come to live at Downton Abbey.  She is a wild child with poor judgment.  She is a liar and a seeker of experiences below her station.  She is a 1920's ""flapper"" who has had an affair with a married man in London and looks for excitement in the most dangerous of places.  There is no reason whatsoever for anyone at Downton to trust her.  She prepared an ad to find a ladies maid for Cora, and placed it in a shop window in town.  She collected the responses and presented them to Cora.  Why?  Cora did not ask her to do this nor did she give Rose permission to solicit on her behalf.  There is no reason for Rose to take it upon herself to place the advertisement.  Cora on the other hand is an American who is self sufficient and used to doing things for herself.  Edna Braithwaite applies along with others, but Rose pushes Cora to accept Edna.  Rose has no prior known relationship with Edna, therefore, no good reason to push for her acceptance by Cora.  During the interview, Cora finds out that Edna once worked at Downton, but left with a good reference from Mrs. Hughes.  Cora is aware of the politics that surrounds the management of subordinates.  She knows that giving a good reference to a terminating employee is not always evidence of good behavior on that job.  However, she does not consult Mrs. Hughes to determine the facts of the termination, but accepts the recommendation of Rose.  This situation doesn't pass the smell test.  In the past, Cora has proven that she is level headed, and capable.  She is not stupid.  Why would she accept an applicant without confirming the circumstances of the termination with her long term employee, Mrs. Hughes? This situation is unbelievable and highly insulting to the American character of Cora.  In other words, American women ain't that stupid!

Edna Braithwaite is a character with vindictive and selfish purpose.  Upon learning of Branson's circumstances and his rise to aristocratic station, she has set out to bring him down or join the ranks of aristocracy herself through her manipulated bond with him.  It is unclear, at this juncture, which direction she intends to pursue.  She has shown her willingness to ignore the protocols of her station in the household and snub some minor advice from Anna about Thomas.  She does not show great commitment to the job of Ladies Maid for Cora and demonstrates a propensity to defy the orders of Mrs. Hughes.  Thomas makes overtures to Edna and she accepts his friendship.  When she negligently damages a garment of Cora's, Thomas assists by instructing her not to admit guilt and he puts the blame for the damage onto Anna.  Anna has been a trusted employee for years.  She has never demonstrated behavior that would cause Cora to question her trust. However, in this unbelievable situation, Cora accepts the explanation of Thomas because of his newly acquired status of trust which he gained through Nannygate, and does not ask Anna for an explanation about the damaged garment.  The American woman whose financial fortune saved Downton Abbey is being portrayed as an easily manipulated idiot.

A nanny is employed to care for the two grand children of Cora and Robert; Tom Branson's daughter, and Matthew Crawley's son.  She isolates the children from most of the family and refuses to take orders from Thomas, the ""Under Butler"".  Thomas, for the wrong reasons, rightfully informs Cora that the nanny is not all she is cracked up to be.  Cora eavesdrops on her and discovers she is being cruel to her first grandchild, the former chauffer's (Tom Bransons) daughter.  Cora immediately dismisses her.  On the surface, this situation appears appropriate.  Thomas appears to be a Good Samaritan.  Beneath the surface, he appears to be vindictively attacking the nanny for failing to recognize his authority as ""Under Butler"".

A package addressed to Mary arrives.  It contains the personal effects of Matthew.  Mrs. Hughes convinces Carson that the contents should be inspected for items that may cause Mary additional grief.  Carson decides that Robert should be given that dubious honor.  The ethics grow increasingly fowl with this decision.  Do Mrs. Hughes, Carson, and subsequently, Robert think they should withhold, hide, or destroy some item(s) that rightfully belong to a grieving widow in some poorly reasoned desire to mitigate her grief?  Mary has proven over the last three (3) seasons that she has the ability to handle her own affairs.  A letter is found by Robert in Matthews personal effects that clearly outline his wishes regarding the disposition of his estate.  It is clear that this is a holographic will.  Robert shares it with the Dowager who tells him that it must be presented to Mary, its rightful owner.  Mary rightfully shows displeasure with her father for going through her husband's effects and sharing the contents of the letter with her grandmother.  Robert claims the letter is not a will and must be sent to the family attorney to determine its validity and authority.  The family lawyer confirms the status of the holographic will and Mary is recognized as 50% owner of Downton Abbey.  The lack of ethics displayed by Mrs. Hughes, Carson, and Robert are a slap in the face of British aristocratic culture for that era.

Rose, the wild child convinces Anna to chaperone her on a visit to London.  They go to a rough and ready bar where a fight breaks out between two men who want her attentions on the dance floor.  When they return to Downton Abbey, one of the two men call on her thinking she is a ladies maid.  Anna assists her in the deception by helping her dress in maid's attire.  Rose greets the young man and lies to him regarding her status.  She tells him she is involved with another man, but passionately kisses the visiting man goodbye.  She tells the first footman, Jimmy Kent, who just happened to be in the rough and ready bar in London at the time of the fight, and helped she and Anna escape, to go along with her lies.  Julian!!  What are you thinking?  Is everyone at Downton corrupt?  What's going on here?

Branson begins to feel uneasy with his new status.  He tells Edna Braithwaite and she quickly responds.  This situation was anticipated when Edna was hired by Cora.  The replacement of O'Brien with Edna Braithwaite was not properly developed.  However, this situation can be corrected.

Lord Gillingham arrives for a party with his valet, Mr. Green.  The valet waits for an opportunity to be alone with Anna, the only married woman on the staff.  He beats and rapes her.  Anna hides in Mrs. Hughes' quarters.  Mrs. Hughes arrives to find Anna beaten, bloodied, and raped.  Mrs. Hughes wants to call in help.  She wants to call in Dr. Clarkson, but Anna demands that she not reveal to anyone what has happened to her.  She is afraid that her husband, Bates will kill the jackal and go back to prison for murder.  Mrs. Hughes complies.  Is Anna to become pregnant with a rapists child and hide the ancestry of the child from her husband?  Will she have a child and put it up for adoption?  Will she have an abortion?  Will she lose Bates for failing to trust him as a man and husband?  Is Anna the latest of many victims of this rapist?  Will rapist Green return or try to blackmail Anna?  This occurrence tipped the scales for me.  Downton Abbey is no longer a masterpiece classic, it is a soap opera styled period tragedy that does not challenge the viewer in a modestly intellectual way, but shocks and tramples the established character traits of its remaining cast.

I am so disappointed in the first three installments of Season 4, that I am giving thought to boycotting the remainder of the season.  I probably won't, but I am giving it some thought.  In the first three seasons, Thomas and O'Brien were the ethically challenged culprits.  In Season 4, just about every main character is an antagonist.  Who can we the viewers trust to have integrity?  Now when I see the beautiful Highclere Castle, it does not bring about feelings of warmth, security, and respectability as it has in times gone by.  It now looks like a house of horrors filled with death, debauchery, rape, and personal ruin.  When I want to endure that kind of tragedy and pathos, I will turn to Shakespeare or Mickey Spillane.",1391731200,28,10157,4.771395749569213

The characters become like dearest friends and you wonder during the weekdays (between airings) what will happen next...how will she/he deal with whatever new 'thing' has happened.  So much happens (or is alluded to) each episode (that's only 48 min. long) that you have towatch it again (and maybe again) before you've 'caught' it all.  The set, costumes, the characters are all real and you only want more as each episode ends.  It's about a time I never knew, but I feel like I'm transported back to the 1920s as I watch it unfold.

With the unfortunate departure over the last two seasons of three of the shows' main characters, it has a very large void to fill. Unfortunately, the void is being filled with ""modernization"".
Thankfully, Mr. Carson still keeps the ship steady, and saves the season.

are the seasons' saving grace.

Every situation is dealt with so logically and in such interesting and unexpected ways.  One of my favorite ideas in Season 4 is the growing relationship between Isobel and Violet (Penelope Wilton and Maggie Smith) in the wake of Matthew's death.  And the stories of Mary and her new suitors are exciting.  Another thing I love about this show, and Season 4 was a perfect example, is that each season doesn't end with the typical cliffhanger.

My husband and I settled down to watch the entire season and I must admit that I was disappointed.  Season four seemed to lack the excitement and the anticipation of exciting things ahead.  It seemed to be more a series of short events strung together.  It moved quickly from scene to scene that things hardly had a chance to develop.  I actually fell asleep in my chair during Part 9 and missed part of what was happening (or not happening).  I can't believe that I actually fell asleep during Downton Abbey!  That would have been impossible in the previous seasons.  There just wasn't much excitement in this series.  Rose does nothing for me.  Of course I will watch season five when it comes out (and I may even watch  part nine of this season that I slept through again to see if I missed anything of real interest).  But something was lacking.  It was slow moving.

5493808,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"As an avid fan and owner of every UK Version of this series, I'm sad to find that I find myself more frustrated than satisfied with Season 4. As others have mentioned, the wicked characters continue to get away with their schemes, there's very little vindication - which seems to happen off-camera to quickly wrap-up plot lines and not to mention, the attempt to tackle at least 3 major issues in one season: Rape, Abortion and Interracial Dating! How, or better yet, WHY do you introduce these weighty topics and give them not much more than a cursory glance!? While watching, you're mentally cringing and sighing ""Oh, Geesh! I know where this one's headed!"" It's ridiculous!  Substance is lacking, the pace feels rushed, much of the personal growth the characters underwent during past seasons has seemingly been lost....it's just simply not the same. It's not the violence or the topics that offend me, but rather the treatment of them. I don't watch the series on TV; I prefer to wait until I can buy the entire season on DVD and then binge-watch. If I had to wait a week between episodes, I would've given up after maybe the 3rd episode. I'm not anxiously awaiting the next season - I'll watch the first episode on TV to see if there's been any improvement first and then decide if I want to continue. What a shame....I expected so much better.",1391472000,5,1349,4.668067226890757

5493810,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"It's really a shame the writers of Downton Abbey have ruined this classy production with violent rape.  In the first two episodes of season 4 it seems the writers have lost their muse and are producing a labored and rather boring story line, so they have to resort to the sordid rape of a favorite character in episode 3.  Add that to the deaths of two of Downton's  characters in Season 3, it's just too much and the joy is gone.  I think Downton's secret in the early seasons was to have just enough pathos to keep the plot interesting without becoming an American-style soap drenched with sleeze, creeps, blood and violence.  If you really want to enjoy the series, turn off the DVD player at the point where Mary presents their new baby to Matthew.  It's a real shame to see the high class of Downton trashed by sleeze.",1391472000,9,823,4.453333333333333

5493841,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I am currently watching Season 4 of ""Downton Abbey"" as it's being aired on PBS, and I believe that Julian Fellowes has brought the story further into the 1920's in a thoughtful and dramatically compelling manner.  Last season he had to cope with two of his stars leaving, Dan Stevens' departure being a huge challenge to the series.  His decision to begin Season 4 six months past Matthew's death was a wise one.  There are some very dark, gritty moments this season, but there are some delightful, lighter moments as well.

Last night I watched episode 5 when it aired, and later in the evening decided to watch it again with less household interruptions on my new DVD set.  I was very surprised to find that lines had been cut; specifically some belonging to Mrs. Patmore and Lady Rose.  A friend has since told me that there are others.

This makes me wonder how much editing has occurred with the other other episodes, and in the DVD sets of seasons past.  I can't believe that Julian Fellowes would be pleased that his dialogue is being pruned, for whatever reason.

The packaging assures that it's the ""Original UK Edition"", and in fact it is not even the series as it's being shown in the US.",1391385600,,1199,4.565420560747664
5493842,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Well to start I'm a BBC, Brit. TV addict: but that aside my opinion about this fourth season is simply smashing.  I was after the second episode afraid that Mr. Fellows had given in to the retread stories are good, new and imaginative stories are bad American Television approach.  However, retread stories told with a vibrancy and fresh ideas was how the season unfolded for the next seven episode. (SIDEBAR: TV Pass is awesome, as you get your shows after they've aired the very next day, and you can accumulate episodes to watch over a long weekend, or just at your leisure.  I have also received the final seven episodes of both series 3& 4 before they were broadcast on American TV.  TV Pass is a good thing to look into if you're like me, and enjoy watching on my on schedule.)
Now back to series 4, I'm not a spoiler so I have to be careful not to reveal anything juicy.  This season was funny, controversial, tender and poignant (break out the large sized box of tissues, and prepare to have to watch scenes over, as you may miss something drying your eyes.) knuckle biting, tense, maddening, exciting, and  just plain Masterpiece Theater at it's best.  Acting, directing, scenery, lighting, music, everything that goes into creating a great production can be found in this fourth series, indeed in all the prior episodes as well.
And so to sum up, Downton Abby season 4 is a don't miss and must own, TV Pass is a great penny saving streaming service, and together the combination ROCKS!!

P.S starting to really CONSIDER dropping Netflix and switching to Amazon Prime. $79.99 a year with benefits, as opposed to my current 7.99+tax streaming only service.  Amazon if you all get into the mail-order DVD rental home distribution arena, and stay away from trying to become the next HBO you'll find that a lot of Netflixer's would jump ship, and sign up for prime.",1391385600,2,1870,4.659574468085107

However as I had previously bought Seasons 1, 2, 3, I felt I had to pre-order this Season in hopes that things would return to the former quality of the story thread in Season 5...when I love a series I don't want to skip Seasons. Really not loving the ""rape"" angle for Anna and Bates...we covered all the prison aspects already...Just a plot line developed to maybe distract us from the ""hole"" left by Matthew's departure...ditto the schizophrenic treatment of the character Thomas...he's a creep in the initial seasons, then he suddenly seems changed and repentant now he's suddenly back to being a weasel...What's up with that? Surely we could give the downstairs as seedy screwed up characters a break and move on to how the upstairs is going to save the estate, raise the little ones particularly Mary's child that no one...not the grieving Grandmothers or Mommy bother to visit...again what's up with that...having lost one's son or husband...it doesn't follow that neither would not focus on the child...
I don't know but my feeling this season was...Good Lord Fellowes ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" pick up a story line that's not recycled and is vaguely reminiscent of something other than a tawdry soap...quiet flailing and develop the characters you still have. Photography and acting as always excellent...now they just need a clue and a plot.",1391385600,3,1460,4.891129032258065

5493855,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I am a Brit living in the USA, and I really miss UK television. I no longer get cable because I do not think it is worth it.

I have series 2-4 on dvd. I love it because it reminds me of home. However, I think the best ones so far are series 2 and 3.

I was a little dissapointed in Series 4. I am not sure what I expected. Maybe it was the long wait!!! I hope Branson does not have a romance with the school teacher. She does not seem to ""fit"" somehow. As for Edith. Good Grief. Maybe I am stuck in a time warp not realizing that times have moved on in the series, but having child out of wedlock?? Tsk Tsk. I need to remind myself that times have changed in the series, and her ""fall from grace"" in that time period is not as shocking. I just recall how digusted she was with Mary's night time excapades.

Anyway, the more British stuff the better. :)",1391385600,,853,3.947674418604651
5493856,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey is one of the best series produced by the BBC. They produce a lot of good quality shows and I have been a fan for many years but this show is so good and the quality actors make it so! I am a fan of English television and BBC and have watched many including Call the MIdwife, another excellent show, but Downton Abbey by far is the best",1391385600,,350,4.014285714285714

5493860,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"We have enjoyed Downton Abbey since its premier season, and this season continues to entertain us. For example, we were saddened by the attack on Anna, the one truly unselfish and giving character in the story. Her husband Bates' grief when he finally learned the truth, as well as his loving way of handling the situation when he talked with her is an example of the quality writing and acting in this series.  We hope to see Anna emerge with the knowledge that her true identity as a good, incorruptible, and decent woman could never really be defiled, despite the social misconceptions of the time. We hope the writers have Bates lets go of his desire for retribution, and that the perpetrator is made to stand trial. We also enjoy seeing some characters (such as Tom, Lord Grantham, and Lady Mary) grow into better people through what they've experienced and through a change of thought. All of the actors make us care about the lives of their characters.

We enjoy Amazon's Instant Video service because we can see the program one day after it airs on public television. Since we don't subscribe to cable or Dish TV, this is the most immediate way fo us to see a current program.",1391385600,,1184,4.633333333333334

5493871,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The fourth season of Downton Abbey, like the others before it, is superbly well written and acted.  Each episode is built around some form of suspense and intrigue, and as the family and their retainers enter the 1920s the old ways of life begin to crumble.  As always there are characters to love, to hate and to pity.  Maggie Smith is brilliant in her portrayal of a 19th century grand dame with a secretly modern outlook.  We miss the actors who had to be 'killed off' because they couldn't continue with the series, but their demise is skillfully woven into the ongoing story through new drama and development.  The overall theme has been attempted before with some measure of success - for example To The Manor Born and You Rang My Lord? - but nowhere as cleverly and realistically as Downton Abbey.",1391385600,3,804,4.633802816901408

I have noticed some scenes on PBS offering a bit more and now, obvious cuts to scenes in my purchased UK EDITION.  The product description for the UK EDITION  professes to be 'uncut.'  If the UK EDITION is indeed the uncut version, why, then, does PBS include certain parts that have been obviously edited out of the UK EDITION?  And. if I purchase version of DOWNTON ABBEY from PBS, will I get the actual and obviously uncut version?  Again, I am very confused but also do not want to have to purchase both versions.  Is there a version available for purchase other than the obviously edited UK EDITION?  I would be so grateful to anyone making clear what I have found so confusing.

One of my most admired friends would quote his Jewish mothers sayings. "" it is easier to see a fly on someone's shoulder than an elephant on their own"".

It's nice that Moseley finally has a girl!  But what about Daisy?  Is she ever going to find Mr. Right?  Edith's decision to have her baby was a great relief.  Mary's quandry of someone to take Matthew's place has everyone guessing.  I'm not sure that any of the current suitors fit the bill.  And did he, or didn't he?  Mr. Bate's suspicious trip to London certainly makes it appear that he did it!  But, if ever a guy deserved a visit from a vigilante avenger, Anna's rapist sure did!  Way to go, Mr. Bates!

I am no longer interested in the characters upstairs except for the tried and true mother in laws of course.  They are proven actresses that give the show some laughs and anticipated scenes.

It was very hard for me to see how women were treated in that day regarding violent acts against them, and especially if they were in service (not of noble blood).

5493919,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"UPDATED:  I re-viewed this Season 4 DVD recently (hoping that my opinion would change - but that isn't the case) and realized that it is missing key scenes.  For example: when everyone is leaving the house party, the scene where Gregson, Samson, and Edith are talking and Gregson returns the IOU to Samson - that ENTIRE scene is missing. There are others missing as well but I don't want to give out any spoilers. So if you think you are purchasing an UNCUT version, this is NOT it.  This same thing happened with the Season 3 DVD (several key scenes are missing).  I don't understand why they eliminate scenes on the DVD version???

I'm  a HUGE fan of this series and couldn't wait until Season 4 premiered here in the U.S.  I already own Seasons 1 thru 3 so when Season 4 was released for sale on Jan. 28, I immediately purchased it.  I won't be giving any spoilers, however, suffice it to say that this Season 4 is just downright TERRIBLE!  There are plot lines that are SO unbelievable you have to scratch your head and wonder if Julian Fellowes and his writers were smoking something.  Example:  in one episode, a character has a huge problem and then the next episode is over 1 year later and the problem is ""solved"" and all we get is an explanation via words.

Also, Mary has a couple of men interested in her which provides a good story line, however, the first man gets reacquainted with her after many, many years and 3 days later he's professing his undying love for her.  What???

You never get a sense that any of this is believable because it happens SO quickly -- we're never allowed to see the relationships develop like they did between Mary and Matthew or Sybil and Tom or even Anna and Bates.  It's like Julian Fellowes is unsure whether the series will be picked up for another season, so he tries to cram tons of script (much of it unnecessary and not believable) into each episode.

And frankly, the sarcastic-ness between Old Lady Grantham and Mrs. Crawley is really getting very old.  In this Aeason 4, Mrs. Crawley helps Violet to a great degree, yet Violet remains her nasty self with Isobel.  Also, we all know that Bates ""saved"" Mr. Barrow in Season 3, yet Barrow still continues to be nasty to Bates and Anna.

Lastly, there are some really stupid story lines in this Season 4.  Surely Cousin Rose isn't a total idiot, yet she continuously makes stupid and hurtful decisions again and again.  It's like they gave her a mind of a 4 year old.  And yet once again, Tom Branson is having difficulty adjusting to his life as part of a rich family.  Really??? Hasn't he been living at Downton for the past 3-4 years?  That story line should have been signed-sealed-delivered ages ago.  Enough with that.

And if I hear the words ""pig man"" one more time, I'll scream!

What I liked?  the clothes, the set decoration, the old cars, and the story line between Alfred (the under-butler) and Daisy, the assistant cook.

This Season is on 3 discs and contains ""The London Season"" which is the 2 hr concluding episode of this Season 4.",1391299200,14,3051,4.5063752276867035

Without spoiling the story, a pivotal situation has occurred that will most probably change several

5493939,5,B00AQVMZKQ,This is one of the most wonderful series I have ever watched.  I am a mystery lover so not my normal cup of tea but once I started watching it I could not quit until I was at the end of season 4.  The characters are so perfectly matched to the roles they play that you cannot wait to see what they come up with next.  I would recommend this series to everyone no matter what your normal viewing preferences are.,1391299200,,411,4.049382716049383

I wasn't sure, even as well loved as this show is, that they could pull off another season with so much CHANGE in the third.

5493944,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"The show was always something of a high-class soap opera, but there has been a steady decline in the level of the writing since Season One. Now, in Season Four, it feels as if the writers are desperate to find any means necessary to spin the plot by throwing anything and everything into the storyline stew. Characters that were legitimately hard-edged and flinty, solidly anchored to the prejudices of their time and class -- like the the Head Butler, the Lord of the Downton, his daughter Mary, and his Mother -- have been softened so much that they now seem cuddly and cute. The art direction and the acting remain first rate, and are now pretty much the only reasons to keep watching.",1391299200,3,688,4.6016260162601625
5493945,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Great season.  Final episode might be one of the best hours of TV ever made.  The final scene was a quite moving - feel good ending!  Hurry up with season 5.,1391299200,,157,4.0

5493948,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was kind of worried that with Matthew gone Downton would take an unhappy tone.  Mary was a little morose for the  first couple of episodes, but it didn't take long for her to get back to life.
The plot had some unexpected twists and turns this season as well!  I was happy that I was able to purchase the TV Pass and view the last four episodes before their television release.  I could not wait to see them!
In the last few episodes we get to see a bit more of Rose and of course ""The Americans"" come to visit!
Another great season at Downton and I am already eager for more!",1391299200,,578,4.088495575221239
5493949,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Great show and soooo addicting.  Can't wait for season 5! I would rather watch the season all at once because I can't stand the wait.  It's a great benefit purchasing the entire season and getting all of the season episodes by the 5th.,1391299200,,235,4.441860465116279

5493952,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abby has always been one of the best looking shows because of the beautiful setting of Highclere Castle. This season has them venturing out and adding to the wonderful places we're all familiar with. Well done.,1391299200,,218,4.918918918918919

5493957,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"There weren't any great shockers in this season, at least none like Season 3. I won't give any plots away, but I will say, I like the new lady's maid for Cora and the tragedy that befell Anna nearly broke my heart. Lots of handsome men available for Mary this season. Not the best season, but still well-written and played out. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1391299200,,352,4.430769230769231
5493958,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Everything!  I especially like how months or more can go by between episodes at times and others feels like at day.  I miss beloved characters that have died and appreciate the actors trueness that come out on the screen.  Equally there are a few characters you don't so much mind seeing taken a beating under a bridge yet somehow the writer and choreography moves you to even like them for a moment.  Such a refreshing switch from the mainstream reality shows and competitions.,1391299200,,478,4.72289156626506
5493959,2,B00AQVMZKQ,The story feels like it's stalled with the loss of cast and the financial cloud of doom hanging over the place. The prevailing theme seems to be about self pity.,1391299200,2,161,4.4

5493963,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I think the viewer, like several of the characters, cannot help mourning Matthew at the start, but I appreciated seeing the growth of several of the characters, and the general loving and loyal behavior of the family.  I still wonder why something positive can't happen to Lady Edith.  The interchange between the dowager duchess and Isabelle is a never ending source of amusement.  Maggie Smith plays the role exquisitely.",1391212800,,423,5.101449275362318

Like most series, with each new year, interest and storyline begins to fade a bit. This might be true for Downton Abby if the plot does not thicken soon! In short this is not as captivating as the first three, but back then Downton Abby  was the new buzz to everyone.",1391212800,,416,4.135802469135802

most characters r well developed while others could use more dimensions to them.  there r some kinks to the storyline but they r minor.  i do not believe the rich would ever have cared one iota of how the staff was getting by in their daily lives.

This practice is unethical and Amazon should take note. I have been watching season 4, and frankly most of the 5 star reviews say nothing of value. Really look for those reviews that are three stars or two. This season is NOT the best. I find this new way of protecting product at the expense of the customer disgusting and those who work for the companies deceitful.

5493988,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I am completely hooked on the Downton Abbey series. Season 4 does not have the heart-break of season 3. (Thank goodness.)
Rose is a real charmer. She spends most of the series getting in trouble but she wins fans as much as she charms every male that walks across her view.  Mary is slowly growing into a fine woman. After the loss of Mathew, she must take over many of his duties. I am so glad to see Mary grow emotionally and professionally.  If you wonder about Michelle Dockery's acting abilities, she does an amazing job with a few pigs and some mud.  Mrs. Hughes and Carson deliver their usual great performances.  I would hate to have either one mad at me.  The downstairs quartet find some resolution.  I wanted more time with Daisy and Mr. Mason.  Anna and Bates continue their suffering. (Yikes!)  Tom Branson wanders around looking lost.  I have admired him the most in past seasons.  He is climbing a very long ladder.  There is hope for him.  Sadly, Lord and Lady Granthem have become part of the background.  Come on! He is an English Earl, there is a lot more to his story.  Finally, there is Mosely and the Lady Edith.  They have the best story lines and the best performances this year.  Lady Edith has finally stopped being Poor Edith.  There are no roses but she finds strength and quality in loving, losing, and loving again.  Good Job!",1391126400,,1356,4.510288065843621

If you have not seen Downton Abbey, please start at the beginning of the series and progress.  You will not be disappointed.  Synopsis: Season 4, set in 1922, sees the return of the much loved characters in the sumptous setting of Downton Abbey. It has been six months since Matthew's tragic death and Mary struggles to face the future with her fatherless child, and is encouraged by the family to pick up the pieces.  Mary now finds herself the reluctant object of attention by a number of eager suitors. Cousin Rose is attracted to the bright lights of London which spells trouble for the Crawleys.  Edith's budding relationship with Michael Gregson is threatened by events beyong her control. Downstairs we have Anna who struggles with her guilt of being raped by Lord Gillingham's valet,  Mr. Molesly becomes enarmored with Baxter, Cora's new lady's maid who is somehow beholding to Thomas Barrow, the under butler, who is constantly prodding her to tell secrets she may have heard between the gentry in the Abbey.

5494007,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"NO ONE KNEW what to expect in Season 4 of Downton Abbey  only that the show would go on even though actor Dan Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley, husband to Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), refused to renew his contract in hopes of pursuing other projects.

Downton Abbey executives, cast and fans took the news hard. The relationship between Matthew and Lady Mary had been the heart of the internationally popular show. In the Meet the New Cast, Hugh Bonnevill, who plays Robert, Earl of Grantham, says, It did feel strange coming back here  to film the first scene a few weeks ago and realizing there was a gap. But, Im sorry guys, no actors are indispensable, and the show and the house and the estate is bigger than any of us.

Executive producer Gareth Neame agrees. Losing a main character is difficult, but now theres a new story about a woman trying to rebuild her life.

Thats the heart of Season 4, watching Mary and the rest of the family and servants get on with their lives. It begins just as we would expect; Marys father, Robert, wants to shelter his daughter  and Mary is in the mood to be coddled. Former chauffeur, now brother-in-law Tom Branson (Allen Leech) encourages Mary to take part in running the estate. Its the Dowager Violet (Maggie Smith), Marys grandmother, who tells her, she alone can choose her fate.

While Mary decides between a life of mourning or activity  and Branson continues to worry about his place in the world and how it might affect his daughter  Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) gets a chance to shine. Previously plain and unlucky in love, Edith sparkles in a gorgeous new wardrobe and her ongoing relationship with journalist/publisher Michael Gregson (Charles Edwards), who gives Robert a helping hand when least expected. Still, as Edwards explains in the New Cast feature, Gregson has something of a dark past and Ediths problems may not be over yet.

As Downton enters the Roaring 20s  with a defiant Lady Rose (Lily James) determined to keep her family screaming  we are introduced to talented black jazz singer Jack Ross played by Gary Carr. Its easy to see where Rose wants to go with this (What doesn't work is the familys reaction to the relationship; frankly, its not in keeping with the period.) Among other newcomers are two potential suitors for Mary, Lord Gillingham (Tom Cullen) and Charles Blake (Julian Ovender), both engaging and likable. I would like to see Mary be bossed around and see someone able to handle her, Dockery says.

Love is a motivating factor for those downstairs, too  except for Barrow (Rob James-Collier), who continues to scheme and plot just because he can. He brings in a new ally, Baxter (Raquel Cassidy), but is she willing to play along? Footman Alfred (Matt Milne), who longs to be a cook, continues his role as the unwitting focus of Daisy (Sophie McShera) and Ivy's (Cara Theobold) affections, much to the frustration of Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) and Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan)  and the confusion of butler Carson (Jim Carter). We also delve further into Bates (Brendan Coyle) unique skills.

As a fan, there is nothing like watching Downton Abbey on Blu-ray. The picture is so much more intense, colorful and detailed than in broadcast, even on an HD-TV. Few films  especially TV series  show off their visual riches as well as Downton with its lavish costuming and scenic locations. (Yes, as standard, the season finale takes us to a lavish party with all the eye-candy.) The 2.0 DTS-MA sound mix remains standard, since the show is largely made up of dialogue, which comes through beautifully. Background music usually emphasizes dramatic moments  by now, we all know the cues  but the jazz moments are clearly defined. As always, these are the unedited British shows, available on both the Blu-ray and DVD.

There are 3 discs in the Blu-ray and DVD sets, and 9 episodes. HD bonus features are brief, each about 10 minutes long. They include Downton Diaries, a video diary of a day on-set led by Sophie McShera, and a making-of feature exploring Season 4, with an emphasis on costumes. The best is Meet the New Cast, that introduces the new actors and their characters, and provides a look at how Season 4 came together.

Creator/writer Julian Fellowes gives viewers time to acknowledge Matthews loss, then masterfully leads us into the new plot threads and characters. It leaves me hoping that Fellowes will take us much further into the Downton story than the projected Season 5 finale.   Kay Reynolds",1391126400,,4499,4.828125

5494016,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have nothing but sympathy for Julian Fellowes. Last season, ""Downton Abbey"" lost two lead characters when the actors portraying them decided they wanted to leave the show. No one could have anticipated that, so Season 4 of the show is really a rebuilding season. I was very, very worried for the first half of the season, which is just....really bad. Things do pick up considerably halfway through, but I still think this is the weakest season of the show by far. Without giving too much away, there is a terrible plot involving Anna that I absolutely hated...LEAVE THE BATES'S ALONE!!!!

Many of the other plots this season are either bad, annoying, or just downright stupid. Daisy has never been my favorite character, but the dull love triangle between her, Ivy, and Alfred quickly grows tiresome. Edna returns to Downton for a stint as Cora's new lady's maid, and she is such a troublemaker! I hate her! Edith has always been an annoying and stupid character, and her storyline takes some ridiculous turns this season. Fellowes couldn't even really come up with anything original for her; he just recycles another character's storyline from earlier in the season. I also think that Maggie Smith is drastically underutilized for the first half of the season (fortunately she compensates for it in the later episodes, with some of her best zingers to date). Sherley MacLaine returns for the final episode reprising her role as Cora's mother, and again I was very disappointed in her performance, feeling that she was vastly underutilized. Paul Giamatti's guest role as Cora's brother is slightly more interesting, but just kind of odd.

The best thing about the season by far is Lady Mary's storyline, focusing how she deals with Matthew's sudden death and takes on a more central leadership role at Downton. While I loved the Mary/Matthew romance and was very sad when Dan Stevens departed from the cast, I have come to believe that Matthew was sort of holding Mary back. We see more of the old Mary this season, the strong, unyielding Mary, who will likely be the reason for Downton's survival. There's also some romance as Mary considers getting back into the dating game, but she takes the whole courtship thing slow. We are left with two primary suitors for Mary, and while they're both okay blokes, I have to wonder if someone better suited for Mary might come along next season.

Another surprise for me this season was how entertaining Rose's character has become. She was super annoying last season, but provided some much-needed comic relief this time around. Also, Isobel has always irritated me to no end, but that wasn't the case this season. Her character undergoes a bit of a transformation as she copes with the death of her only son and slowly returns back to life. Penelope Wilton delivers some great performances.

Aside from Anna's tragedy, there wasn't anything super shocking this season. I think Fellowes let the audience off easy, and Season 5 will probably consist of many more deaths and dramas. I hope that's the case, and that it's much better than Season 4.",1391126400,3,3090,4.88

5494022,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Watched season four in one sitting with my husband.  The Blu-Ray is crisp and gorgeous.  The sound is awesome.  And of course the UK version is uncut and shown the way it should be.  Why would anybody want the US version is beyond me.

Now for the season.  **Spoilers**

Having lost one of my favorite characters, Matthew.  I was afraid where Fellowes would go with this season.  Not to worry as it is an amazing production!  The acting is second to none.  And the costumes, sets, scenery, is just stunning in it's entirety.  WOW.
Yes it started off a little slow but as I remember so did every season.  Patience is well rewarded.  So historically accurate and delicious.

Anna's story is intense and very difficult to watch.  This could have gone over the top but Joanne Froggatt plays Anna with such conviction and helplessness that you ache for her.  Plus she nailed what a woman goes through after a violent rape.  People must remember this was the 1920s and the attitude ""let sleeping dogs lie"" was in force.  Child abuse and rape were taboo subjects with very few women (especially servants) getting justice.
I love the character John Bates(Brendan Coyle).  He is I feel the strongest written character in the series.  You just never really know what he will do.  Revenge?  Pick pocket?  Forger?  A man of many talents.  And I fist pumped when Lady Mary found the ""ticket"" and then burned it later!
Ah Lady Mary(Michelle Dockery).  We see her go through depression and then pull herself back to the living.  So damn British and beautifully written.  Watching her wear black and slowly transform back to color,as she goes through her sadness, is well done.  And now the story starts with the suitors that appear and how she handles that next life chapter.  She has grown so and now we see the mature, responsible Mary.
Lady Edith's(Laura Carmichael) story was sad again.  Poor thing just can't find any happiness and I want her so badly to find some. And there were times I wanted to call her a twit and say ""Grow Up""!!!  Maybe in season 5 she can finally find love?  And now a baby added.
As always the Earl(Hugh Bonneville) and Lady Cora(Elizabeth McGovern) are incredible characters.  What they deal with this season is poignant and real.  But there is also a good dose of humor and intrigue to be had.  He turns a character who could have been a cliche into someone who feels very real to me. Bravo, Hugh!
Violet Crawley(Maggie Smith) and Isobel Crawley(Penelope Wilton) are two of the best written characters on television, period.  The exchanges they make.  The friendship they show when one is in need.  The love they really share.  Just outstanding! "" I wonder your halo doesn't grow heavy. It must be like wearing a tiara around the clock"".  ""Just because you're an old widow, I see no necessity to eat off a tray"".
Tom Branson(Allen Leech), Lady Rose(Lily James), Lady Rosamund(Samantha Bond) have all good stories to add this season.  We now see the flappers and Jazz coming to England.  Lady Rose trying to piss off her mother.  Tom becoming a stronger and more interesting character.  It's all good.
I love the downstairs crew.  As always we see Thomas(Robert James-Collier) trying to be his scheming, conniving self which is too bad but then a Leopard can't change his spots can he?
Mr. Carson(Jim Carter) shown very human and funny.  Another great character!  Mr. Carson: But what does it matter anyway? We shout and scream and wail and cry, but in the end we must all die.
Mrs. Hughes: Well. Thats cheered me up. Ill get on with my work.
And then that brings us to Mrs. Hughes(Phyllis Logan) in a brilliant role/character.  She is the heart and soul of Downton Abbey.  The keeper of the keys.  The one they all go to for a cuppa and a cry.  Its not for me to have an opinion. But I will say this  Mrs. Hughes
Mrs. Patmore(Lesley Nicol) just as feisty as always this season.  She is just hilarious but also very tender hearted which makes her character one of my favorites.  Cora: Mrs. Patmore, is there an aspect of the present day that you can accept without resistance.
Mrs. Patmore: Oh milady. I wouldn't mind gettin' rid of my corset.  Just so good!
Daisy(Sophie McShera), Ivy(Cara Theobold), Alfred(Matt Milne) great story between the three of them this season.  And I'm sad to see Alfred go but glad we still have Daisy.  Here's another character, Daisy, that is maturing nicely.
The story with Molesley(Kevin Doyle) and newbie Baxter(Raquel Cassidy) is going to be interesting.  What is Baxter hiding?  Will Molesley find love with Baxter?  I like Baxter and am glad we have a new character that is not mean or conniving.

I enjoyed seeing the suitors of Mary.  Likewise the emotions and torments shown by all this season.  Guest stars Shirley MacLaine and Paul Giamatti were fabulous.  And the sparring between Violet and Martha Levinson is not to be missed!!!  Some things I would have changed.  The whole Edith thing was a little far fetched.  And I really think that Anna should have told John what happened.  As close as they are how could she not tell the love of her life?  Unbelievable.
Still I love this production.  The acting, costumes, history, music and scenery are enough to watch Downton Abbey but I also love the characters and writing (even when it's over the top).

5494030,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"One of my favorite pastimes is to download Downton Abbey from Amazon.com  It is so simple and in a matter of minutes, I am watching Season 4.

Episode 1, is, as expected, very sad as the viewer is reminded (in almost every scene) of the tragic ending to Matthew Crawley's life.  However, the introduction of Cousin Rose in Season 3 added some much needed excitement and challenge to the storyline.  This ""Downton Abbey Diva"" has breathed new life into the Crawley-Grantham household.  Who doesn't love to follow an adorable troublemaker with good intentions?

What happens to Anna is totally unexpected and unnerving.  It compels viewers to speculate if the truth will ever be revealed and, if so, will Mr. Bates be able to restrain himself???  And, what will Lady Mary have to say about it?  This is a good Segway to Lord Gillingham; a debonair gentleman to say the very least and a brilliant addition to the cast as Lady Mary's new, adoring suitor and ""Glamourous Pirate"" as duly named by Lord Grantham.  Bravo Tony Foyle!!  I do hope that you stay for more than one season.

The elimination of O'Brien & Braithwaite is a relief! These two ""Lady's Maids""  were beginning to bore me. Besides, who likes to follow troublemakers with bad intentions!  Poor Branson, he is like a fish out of water -- someone please throw him a line so that he can save himself, ""Sibby"" & Downton.  I am glad to see that the house has embraced Thomas, all in, as he continues to be a  sly, yet entertaining troublemaker!  As for Mr. Carson's trip down ""Memory Lane,"" I should hope that there is more to this later in the season -- really, Mr. Carson, who are you? The curiosity of a possible love affair between  Isobel Crawley & Doctor Clarkson is just killing me-LOL!

Saving the best for last ~ How truthful is Lady Edith's Editor and will she dare trust him enough to walk down the aisle again?  Thank you,  Maggie Smith (Violet) for your incredible acting.  You have such a convincing way of delivering those ""Pearls of Wisdom"" to all!

5494041,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Jan-30-2013 No spoilers here. Last night I finished watching the entire 4th season, and must say that the picture quality of the Blu-rays far exceeds what we see during the PBS HD broadcast. And John Lunn's music, as always, sounds wonderful. While the season may have had some disappointments, noted by myself and others when we began watching early episodes on PBS in the U.S., enough happens in later chapters to redeem it, and while it certainly wasn't perfect, there are sufficient interesting plot points to set the stage for future intrigues in the seasons that will surely follow. And I was pleased with the special features. One point: The final episode is 2 3/4 hours long, referred to as ""The London Season,"" and I was amazed at how quickly those nearly 3 hours flew. And the 3 behind the scenes specials are, in total, about 36 minutes, and even though they fly (because they're so fascinating), they seemed longer than that. I just love this series and now have 4 seasons of it on Blu-ray and my appreciation of it hasn't diminished.",1391040000,,1046,4.721311475409836

Includes The London Season, the Season 4 finale--8 months after the season ending

Over 30 minutes of bonus video...
The Making of  . ..
Meet the New Cast
(A lot of the same stuff that shows up on PBS, 10 minutes each.)

Downton Diaries
(The Highclere and Ealing film sites hosted by Laura Carmichael and Sophie McShera, respectively. Basically a day in the life on each set. YMMV, but I could watch these two for hours. Sadly, this is 10 minutes.)

Blu-ray is 8.75 hours in duration. This US Blu-ray includes the same 9 episodes that broadcast in the UK. In order to view this product on US players, the content has been converted from a PAL to NTSC frame rate resulting in approximately 2 additional minutes per episode. The program content is the same.

(What this means is that you get the UK 45 minute episodes instead of the US 50 minute episodes--except for the first two, which were shown in the US as one long ep. The extra five minutes were footage cut from the UK version to make room for ads. Which means if you've been taping the show, your version is longer than the one you'll pay for.)

I like the show, enough to have bought the UK discs from Amazon UK when they were available months ago. If you did that, you won't get anything more by buying these. What I don't like is the marketing decision to just transfer the UK stuff to US format without adding a thing--like the extra scenes.

Pain is pain, and no amount of money can ease the strife of losing a loved one.

5494077,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Ordered Season 4 on Blu-Ray and paid for overnight shipping so I could receive it right away. Watched the entire season Monday/Tuesday and I find I must make a comment or two on my most favorite show.

Obviously I love this show.  However I am wondering if I am the only person who thought that Season 4 which consists of only 8 regular episodes, not including the end of year special, was a bit short? Other seasons had more episodes so I was bit disappointed with the length of this season.

However, I'm thinking that Season 4 was shorter than normal due to the issues that Season 4 had to deal with, i.e. mostly Mary's life after the loss of Matthew.  Personally I feel Season 4 did it's job to establish a life for Mary after Matthew but I still miss Matthew's character.  Wondering what other's think.

Hopefully I won't spoil the show for anyone else when I say what in the heck is wrong with Mr. Fellowes?  Apparently the writer of our beloved Downton Abbey cannot let anyone be happy for to long.  Take the story line for Anna who is one of my favorite characters and someone who deserves some happiness after Mr. Bates being in prison.  Then there is the long suffering Edith.  It was bad enough for Edith to be jilted at the altar in Season 3 but now Edith has to endure more agony in Season 4.  Daisy continues to be Daisy with no one that really cares about her other than Mrs. Patmore in a sweet and caring motherly type fashion.  Finally by the way - what the heck is up with Thomas?  Just when you thought he had grown a heart, and others came to his aid in Season 3, they've got him being the downstairs jerk again.

While I love Downton Abbey and continue to watch, and watch again, each season until the next comes out it seems that Season 4 was the year to basically retool the show.  While I did like Season 4 I can't say I loved it as much as the other seasons and it was not solely due to the loss of Matthew.  To me, the best episode was the end of year special.

Honestly I think I'm a bit irritated at the writing and storylines of let's make everyone suffer and be miserable most of the time.  While I wait for Season 5, and will watch as Downton Abbey continues as my favorite show, I will say that I felt Season 4 had the potential to be really grand and I feel that Mr. Fellowes missed the mark. Thus the 4 star rating instead of 5.",1390953600,8,2362,4.211111111111111

It was so dependent on the Mary Matthew relationship in the first three seasons, I didn't see how it could survive the loss of Dan Stevens. The first 4 episodes were just proving me right.

5494154,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I'm not purchasing Season Four because it is such a huge disappointment.  Frankly, when Dan Stevens chose to leave the series the intelligent move on the part of Fellowes and the producers would have been to hire another actor to play ""Matthew"" so that the storyline of his and Mary's marriage and Matthew's moving into the role of running the estate could have been continued because Matthew was the ""future"" -- he was the young professional class -- an attorney -- who had inherited an estate and married into the aristocracy and at the same time saw that Branson, his Irish servant class  brother-in-law, was going to be a partner in the modernizing of the Downtown estate.  There were many stories that could proceed from that -- but by ""killing"" the character of Matthew,  Fellowes basically ""killed"" the core of the series.  Frankly, if he was going to kill the Matthew character, he may as well have ended the series altogether because the writing and plotlines in season four so far -- are inferior and reflect bad daytime soap opera writing.  Only the Dowager and Matthew Crawley's mother have any good lines and far too few IMO,  having Anna raped and then treat Bates like dirt in order ""to save him from himself"" for fear he would attempt to avenge what happened to her is a moment of ""jumping the shark"" which no series can afford to do and keep its audience.  The introduction of Edna as Cora's maid had no point.  The new ladies' maid appears to have a shady past -- so once again we are supposed to believe that the Granthams are so stupid that they'd continually hire terrible people to work for them when very obviously in the past they were smart enough to hire very good staff like Mrs. Patmore, Anna and Bates, Carson, Daisy, Alfred and Mrs. Hughes.  The character of Thomas remains static -- he's still a wretched man despite the fact that various members of the family and staff have shown compassion toward him in his time of despair at having been revealed to be homosexual in age when it could result in arrest and imprisonment.  Thomas has never been revealed to be a ""stupid"" man so one would assume that over time, he would change for the better as he realized that the entire world was not set against him -- nonetheless, once again he is thoroughly unpleasant this season and -- worse -- his character is now boring.
I cringe at the knowledge that later this year the godawful Shirley Maclaine and her godawful character will return -- she's like nails on chalkboard -- and this time she'll be toting along Paul Giamatti -- ugh!
I think the best thing we can all do now is enjoy re-watching the first three seasons which were entertaining despite being soap operaish -- because now it's just a soap opera and not terribly entertaining soap opera.",1390867200,64,2777,4.612576064908722

5494167,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"For those who wrinkle up their noses and pronounce the series ""a period-piece soap opera,"" I say the script itself is extraordinary. Example: the interaction between Lady Mary and the recent suitor, when she told him that as much as she might be filling his heart, her heart was still full of Matthew.... And the acting is superb--each one becomes the character, not overdoing emotions or reactions but a carefully nuanced portrayal of a scene or incident. Fellowes' genius has to be the cornerstone of this work, of course carried out by a talented cast and crew. Kudos to them all!",1390867200,2,583,4.782178217821782

5494208,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton came to my attention half way through the first season; and I was thrilled to find a series which actually lived up to the press hype.
I've purchased the series through Amazon Prime; and have yet to be disappointed w/ their service; I wish the same could be said of the fourth season.
It's as though Mr. Fellowes has spent far too much time surfing the average, or below average American Drama line-up searching for plot lines, only to fail miserably.
I did away w/ the Cable/Dish; so I could control my viewing, instead of opting for the best of a bad lot, only to have it visited upon me here as well. I suppose its the plague of people like Mr. Fellowes; that when ratings begin to drop, their knee-jerk reaction is to revert to the redundancy of tired scenarios while throwing in violence, making sure its once again targeted towards women. I fear that before the series ends he has insured that Anna, the moral compass of the story, will sadly find herself in the role of widow.
As was stated in another review; there are so many other characters w/ the potential for great story lines if only the time and interest were still there to bring them to fruition.",1390867200,11,1172,4.481308411214953
5494209,1,B00AQVMZKQ,They advertise that you can get all episodes if you buy season pass but they just never made episodes available.  They seem too bothered to make good on their promise.

5494217,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Seems to be a lot of unhappiness with season 4? Rightfully so! This season so far is about deep and profound loss. For those citing boring, well, I guess it could be if you have never lost a child or the love of your life or a parent 40 years too soon. I only used to watch this show because of I am a bit of an Anglophile, especially when it comes to all things Victorian - but wow have I been impressed with the characters and story matter so far! They are trying to fit in much more than the regular, albeit in creative, soap operatic and romantic novel dramatic lines. I can see how that disappoints more conservative viewers who are looking for comfort drama and the same old characters.

And while I try not to get too concerned about ""reality"" on a work of fiction, those viewers that get upset that character motivation seems unbelievable - you should take into consideration there may be lots of back stories in the course of the 6 months between the end of season 3 and the start of season 4. Thomas, like a real person, has evolved significantly over the course of the series and I would argue has the most depth of any character. Not only is it completely believable they would ""keep"" him on staff, he is the under-butler now, or number two in charge. It appeared Jimmy was ready to accept Thomas as a friend at the end of season 3, they now appear to be very close starting season 4. In the last year Thomas has made big strides in letting his guard down, accepting help and being vulnerable. He also had big moments like saving the cricket match while he somewhat gracefully acquiesced to Bate's return as the Lord's valet, had no small part in getting rid of the murderous O'Brien, and recently rescued George and Sybil from their abusive nanny! Haters hate, and I'm sure there is more twists coming for our hero/anti-hero but I for one am glad that they are not getting rid of one of the few deeply complex and developed characters on the show. Perhaps Thomas haters should try watching Duck Dynasty for something more along their tastes? ;)",1390694400,4,2057,4.427440633245382
5494218,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I cherish this show and look forward to watching it on my iPad without any distractions.  This year has had some good and bad surprises but is top quality and timeless.,1390694400,,168,4.419354838709677
5494219,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"The first three seasons were charmers.  But this season, the whole thing has turned into just another soap opera with nice clothes.
Robert can't be as stupid as he's depicted!!!  Cora, we knew was stupid and empty headed but she puts a real topper on it this year!!!
Thomas who could be developing some really good redemptive character and make some good marks for the family is worse than he ever was.... Is Julian a homophobe?
The rest of the crew INCLUDING TOM are just cut-outs....

I am so disappointed!!!!",1390694400,6,511,4.655555555555556
5494220,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Gosh, I am so surprised at the reviews that take apart the characters along with the story-lines, flummoxed by why the characters  didn't say this or that to make the plot more believable .. folks, this is ENTERTAINMENT.. if you want reality, go rent a copy of The Deer Hunter or Deliverance.",1390694400,3,292,4.615384615384615
5494221,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"(Contains SPOILERS)
The premiere of the 4th season was disappointing enough---the absence of Matthew made the show feel hollow. I know Stevens wanted out, but Mathew was so pivotal a character, I just don't see why they couldn't get another actor to play the role.
But I continued to episode 4, and I think I'm done. There seems to be no growth or new dimensions to the characters, or the story lines. I'm completely indifferent to the cousin Rose-and truth be told, can't even recall how she ended up at Downton---a testament to how uninteresting she is. Mary being offered a marriage proposal; Anna's violent attack; Tom and that nutty maid (again)...The season is throwing all these developments without any kind of build-up or trajectory..so the viewer is left feeling completely detached from it all.

Truth be told, after I saw the Season 3 finale last year, my expectations for Season 4 were low. Matthew + Mary was the foundation of the show. Now that that foundation is gone, the show is floundering; and the writers are having a hard time propelling the show forward without a solid backbone. 2/5",1390608000,27,1106,4.821052631578947

However, the ploy that some secret is known to few and other characters simply react to it is as old as the hills. That can be boring to American viewers as it occurs too often in American TV.

It didn't take long for the writers and superb cast to draw me in. They keep us on our toes, never knowing what the next week shall bring. It feels more like a movie than a TV show.

I was disappointed to read that the UK version is considered better by many viewers who said the USA version is choppy in places, I suppose to accommodate commercials.

While on a PBS members' board for the first time, I happened upon an unsuspected spoiler about future episodes that had already aired in the UK. I could have done without knowing how a heinous crime was resolved.

Our family was very saddened by the abrupt loss of Matthew Crowley though at the end of Season 3- Honestly, we became worried that the writers had lost their minds! But thank goodness Mary finally returns to the land of the living! It seemed perhaps the writers had to make some drastic measures due to cast members being hired away to more lofty offers? No surprise though in that respect since they possess such great acting. As for the beginning of Season 4 it did seem to drag a little in respect to poor Mary's grieving. We were beginning to worry she'd have to go to an insane asylum. LOL  But, thank goodness she came back and things are starting to look promising again. Especially now that Robert has to be on his toes if he's to hold onto his beloved traditions!

A whole season should be analyzed after watching the whole thing!! Oh well...(lol). I found this season to be a little contrived and tedious compared to the others which always left me hanging on for more. Except for the Anna part of the storyline, it all seemed rather unimaginative. Love the theme music though. Sometimes it's the best part of an episode. Pompous dialogue, even if witty, can wear thin without an interesting and captivating storyline. I'm not giving up by any means. Please film more episodes, and make them a little more captivating. Eight episodes and a Christmas epy just fly by too fast...(especially when you kinda cheat and watch 'em all in about 3 days!!...laugh). Now I'll have to wait another year.

5494311,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have been so disappointed with the story line in this 4th season.  Several of the once ""level headed"" characters now come off as less than mature and more self-centered.  Also, why in the world could we not have at least one season where Bates and Anna have a life filled with happiness instead of despair.

I will continue to watch, but all the while I'll be pulling for a brighter outcome to all the current suffering and emotional distress.  Also, I'm still undecided if ""Rose"" has really added any value to the story line.  Having a ""Mother"" as homely as her character does, guess the powers that be thought they needed to find a ""less than pretty"" actress.....too bad.

I'm still a fan, but one that is longing for a ""change of direction""!",1390262400,3,746,4.529850746268656
5494312,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I started watching Downton Abbey after season 1, but I've seen all seasons so far, thanks to amazon instant video. People kept talking about it, so I decided to get into it. It's a pretty good show once you get into it, but it does move a little bit slow at times, so be patient if you're just starting out. Purchase all of the seasons to get caught up. It's a great way to do it because it does tend to be addictive and with the instant videos you don't have to wait a week to see what happens next.
They leave us hanging  on a cliff in many episodes, which is the perfect way to do it---you just can't wait to see what happens next.
 Part of what is so interesting is the way people lived in England back then. Society's class system was strict and people staunchly followed the ""rules"" of their class, no matter where they stood . I can't help but laugh a little at the aristocrats of high society---they can't seem to function without their servants--at all. They can't dress or feed themselves, and God forbid they ever step foot in the kitchen to cook anything. They can't even get out of bed until they've been served breakfast.  Somehow, though, the servants don't seem to resent all of this catering to their ""Ladies' and ""Lords""  needs---they actually take great pride in their work, and except their station in life, seemingly without ever expecting more.
 The higher-ups actually treat their servants quite well and often include them in discussions about their difficulties, often asking advice.  It's amazing how everyone has been going along with the Status Quo for decades, and the ""new world"" they all face after WWI is upsetting to all. Things are slowly staring to change----let's see what happens next!
The acting and writing is all very good and Maggie Smith,of course, is a stand-out. She has some zinger lines that are delivered in a way that only Maggie Smith can do it. Hope they give her more. Enjoy!",1390262400,2,1926,4.568115942028985

I'm sure eventually I'll own the whole thing, to watch when I'm home with a cold.  Season 4 starts off with recycled Gosford Park, with the concert upstairs masking violent mayhem down.  The whole ""we can't tell Mr. Bates because he will kill [what's-his-face] and then hang for it"" is ridiculous and lazy and lame.  Is Bates really an out of control killer?  Really?  I thought the pie did it.  Oh, well, I'll keep watching for the costumes and lovely surroundings, but Downton Abbey is fast becoming a lazy soap opera.

Three seasons shaping characters and stoking emotional investment among your viewers --  just to have well-drawn characters suddenly act ""uncharacteristically.""

However, along with Matthews equally shocking death, the ""Downton Abbey train"" has veered off its tracks.  We are no longer sipping tea in the club car and looking out at a sublime landscape.  Instead, we see a mangled body (Matthew)and a raped woman (Anna), utterly destroying the veneer of order and impeccability we had been enjoying hitherto.
I can appreciate why the audiences feel betrayed - our own vestigial innocence blind-sided!",1390089600,38,682,4.956140350877193

5494346,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"Seasons 1 - 3 were great!  I cancelled my pre-order for Season 4 as, unfortunately, the writers have lost track of what really made this episode so special.  It is now just sensationalism and ""American soap opera"" at it's worst.  The killing of Matthew was a big mistake as his marriage to Lady Mary, with new baby, was just getting on track.  The rape of Anna, a sweet and popular character, is the last straw as far as my wife and I are concerned.  This series used to make us feel good and was very interesting to watch... now it has become cheap and is no longer an uplifting series... too bad.  It didn't have to be this way...",1390089600,74,632,4.26890756302521

5494350,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Downton Abbey for the win. Always entertaining. Period drama is surprisingly riveting with great story lines. You will like it best if you start with season 1 and view them in order.,1390089600,,182,4.71875

5494362,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Rebuilding after the death of the most popular and dare I say main character is hard. I would like to see downtown make it past WWII if they can push that far ahead, however to go that far several more characters will have to come and go. Still disappointed one of the characters is up to his old tricks again. One would have though he would have out grown them by now.",1390089600,,369,4.138888888888889

A friend was ""stuck"" at my place while her flights were cancelled for days at a time, and we began a 33-hour Downton Abbey Marathon.  At first we thought about switching to something else, we had trouble with the English, accents and word use, and so many characters!  Suddenly, it all came together and we were HOOKED!  Brilliant - very well written, incredible pace introducing some history with wit and a great story.  Can't wait to start watching the next season!  I expected better quality from Blue-ray, however, as at time the sound track gets a little off from the video track and it's quite annoying, but the show is so good even that becomes forgivable.",1390089600,,763,4.656716417910448

5494367,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"There wasn't enough Thomas for me (I love his wickedness and the kind heart he keeps hidden) after the first show.  Other characters come and go;  I found Cora's brother confusing.  No sociopathic American playboy would change so drastically from the picture that's been painted of him.  Lord G is just annoying in the first few episodes, then thankfully charges off for a time.  Didn't like what happened to Anna, and Rose goes from overactingly annoying to being the bright spot.  Nice to see Mary thaw, Edith be stupid, and Mrs. Patmore, one of my favorite characters may be preparing to leave so Daisy can take over?  The two old ladies of Downton are great as usual.  The Xmas special IS in the UK version, despite what other reviewers say, so don't go by their misinformation.",1390089600,,782,4.698529411764706

5494369,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love Downton and this episode didn't necessarily disappoint, but there are some disturbing developments, not unlike some of the early episodes in the first season that seemed more thrown in to make the story more sensational than developing naturally.  I guess the writers have to come up with something to keep the story going and keep it from getting too boring, but it does seem contrived at times.",1390089600,,403,4.840579710144928
5494370,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was worried that this season would be a disappointment after Matthew's death, but the intrigue and character and plot twists continue with a vengeance!  Maggie Smith continues to delight as the indomitable matriarch; the character of Robert is still stuffy and incompetent; Mary grows softer and stronger, simultaneously; Anna and Bates continue to be innocent victims of others' evildoings, etc.  The intermingling of the upstairs and downstairs lives is captivating, and the plot goes on and on!  I love it!",1390089600,2,511,5.283950617283951

5494379,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The two hour premiere of this Season reintroduced us to our favorite characters, upstairs and down, to see what they were up to. There are some missing faces this season, some more missed than others. But new characters are arriving on the scene. Mary is in mourning but it appears may be jolted out of it by a charming new friend. Edith grows more interesting with her mature love and agreeable man, but will her father ever accept him? He's not landed gentry. The dowager duchess is as pithy and witty as usual. Matthew's mother looks better in her new hairstyle. Fun to know how Carson loved and lost. Am loving the 1920's fashions - the twenties offer so much fun and style. Looks like some juicy twists and a promising season.",1390003200,,731,4.545454545454546
5494380,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Even though the first two episodes were rather dull---we should have known--Mr. Fellowes loves a sharp twist, doesn't he? But Poor-Poor Anna!!!!!!!!  What a predicament-she is in---her devotion to Bates will keep that dirty bastard who attacked her out and happily attacking more innocent people!!!!  Or will it? Will someone give him what he deserves???? I hope so!!!",1390003200,4,368,5.327586206896552
5494381,2,B00AQVMZKQ,Yea... its getting pretty cheezy and way to violent . somehow i just don't care about anyone in it anymore.  kind of nauseating. and if Bates gets revenge and goes to jail that might make it interesting...,1390003200,5,205,4.54054054054054
5494382,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Cconsidering Bates actually helped Thomas last season and saved his butt.  Consider that O'Brien was put in her place with respect to her secret of the soap.  You would think the character of Thomas would surely have changed for the better.  Instead we get another season of a mean-spirited Thomas.  WHY?  I think the audience would have welcomed a nicer Thomas and many of us actually looked for him to be nicer and kinder, especially since O'Brien sneaked off into the night.
The new maid could have surely come on board to create problems without Thomas.
I find Cora the most boring of characters in all seasons.  How is it possible for both Cora and his Lordship to be that dumb?  Thought by now they would have gained insight into devious characters serving and WHY would they suddenly believe a new maid depicting Anna as anything but honest?  That should have been nipped in the bud upon saying.  Can't imaging any lady of the house being that stupid.  Season 4 seems to be a repeat of other seasons.  Can it be our DA Jullian Fellows is out of ideas?  It is bad enough Matthew is gone, but a repeat of the same old, same old!
What I do love and have loved from the beginning is Dame Maggie Smith (Queen of the double-take) who has been given the best lines in every season.  What a fantastic actress!  Love that woman.  Mary is a bit boring and needs to get her spirit up.  She needs to be more fiesty.
I fear this season may be a wash.",1390003200,9,1444,4.37218045112782

I had heard about the rape of Anna through spoiler alerts last year. Is the series running out of ideas? Seems as if it was searching for what to do, now that ""Matthew"" is off the show. Thomas continues to be annoying. Cora is starting to come across as not particularly smart (does she really believe Thomas' disparaging comments about Anna?), versus a society woman trapped in the  mores of British aristocracy.

It basically takes our modern values and redacts them into history, creating situations and perspectives that these characters NEVER would credibly have in their day.  The whole thing basically becomes a big game of dress up, acting out a weak screen play in fabulous clothes...  BUT, the clothes are fabulous, so I do still watch :)",1389830400,23,755,4.8515625

I ordered it on Amazon and watched a few minutes of it thinking it was some sort of a review but then realized that it was the 2nd hour of the first 2 hour showing on PBS!  I then went to episode 3, rented it and enjoyed the hour long 3rd episode show.
A refund would be nice.

5494427,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"First rate production, acting, script, story-line. This is addicting! After watching the Forsyte Saga, I was not looking forward to what I felt would be a step down, and not at all comforted by the fact that every one was raving about it. True, Downton is no Forsyte, but it is the most scintillating period soap-opera ever on television. Some times I did want to strangle the folks upstairs, but one is meant to find their concerns alarmingly trivial and at the same time, their sorrows run deep and they mostly mean good. The whole affair might be one big old cliche, but a thoughtful and often witty script freshens  the ""upstairs, downstairs"" premise, and Maggie Smith is a delight to watch; one savors her every twitch and bob. The entire cast shines. One feels one is living at the Abbey, which is a wonderful place to be.",1389830400,3,828,4.594594594594595

5494430,4,B00AQVMZKQ,I only gave season 4 a 4 star rating because it didn't contain enough episodes. It needed to be longer.,1389830400,,103,4.2
5494431,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have been such a huge fan of Downton Abbey.  This story is so important to me as a member of the Spencer family and relation to the current Earl of Spencer (also sharing the same full name as my father) at the family estate in Althrop.

Yet after the fabulous season 3, and cliff hanger, season 4 was such a let down. Instead of revealing plot for those who have not seen season 4.. All I will say is that this season the plot will center around two key events. One surrounding Anna Bates (chamber maid) married to John Bates (butler/valet)... which after the sadness, drama of previous seasons of following these two characters.. was the plot twist really realistic or necessary?  The other concerns lady Edith

However some of the great characters are just not even developed in season 4. BOO!  Personally I was shocked that the incredible acting of Rob James Collier as Thomas Barrows was not showcased after season 3. Meaning after the incident between Thomas and Jimmy, and Thomas profound lonliness and determination to up in class ranks, that they did not develop a plot around him. Was this because O'brien left the show?  Which was also awful. She was essential to the plot.  So sad.

The other characters of Daisy, Mrs. Pattmore etc. are hardly developed this season.  And the love interest of Jack Ross for Lady Rose is sort of funny and odd choice for plot... not to mention his vocal styling is completely wrong for the period. AKA mediocre.

Also Kiri Te Kanawa as Nellie Melba? REALLY? pleassssssse. LOL  Not to mention Nellie Melba would have never sung in a private home, not to mention the repertoire choice was mediocre.

How about Mary's development? WOW not well thought out.  Such a let down!! A bit insulted after the great writing from the previous 3 seasons!.  Fans deserve better.  It feels like this was slapped together quickly.

The final Xmas episode is sort laughable too with the plot at Buckingham Palace. It would have been much more interesting to have filmed in NYC during the jazz age. esp with more involvement from Shirley MacClaine who does a splendid job as usual.

Luke warm rating.

5494432,5,B00AQVMZKQ,One of the things I like about Downton Abbey is its focus on old/new England. The family pulls together to help each other in spite of the differences in generational thinking and customs. Robert and Mary are about to bang head-on with the women's property issue.

5494507,1,B00AQVMZKQ,The producer claims that the rape of a beloved character was just reflecting the times.  That is what they tell themselves because they have now lost sight of the entertainment value of their production.  They have fallen further into the soap opera writing style that dictates that no character can be allowed to live a happy life for more than one episode.  Don't become connected to anyone because affection for a character will only urge the producers to kill or injure them in some awful and meaningless way.,1389744000,34,513,4.806818181818182

Now they have raped another of my favorite characters (which I, and it seems others, cannot live with).  This is the type of plot one expects from a dying TV series, not from one which keeps receiving more accolades at every turn.  Call it sensationalism, call it cruelty, call it what you will, but I'm not supporting their ratings anymore.  Downton has the cast, crew, costumes and (we hoped) the creative brains to make a nice long run of it as a series...the rape scene in Episode 3 was quite simply overkill, unnecessary, and off-putting.",1389657600,69,696,4.672131147540983

5494515,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I have to agree with ""Just Bill"", he couldn't have said it better. It started out as a very classy show, more than the mundane drivel we're used to being served. Through Season 3 it was a good show, however Season 4 started off badly with an un-necessary rape of Anna. There was no reason to go this direction, unless plots are getting hard to come up with and you can watch any soap opera on tv and be just as well served. Julian Fellowes, who started off as quite a good writer, has now sunk to about as low as any writer can get. We need movies to lift our spirits, not needing to watch what we can see any night on the news shows. So sorry, Downton, you had a good short run, but no longer do you meet my criteria for something worth watching.!

It is believable with beautiful people as well as poor uneducated but very lovable people  and keeps my interest.  I hate for it to end,",1389657600,,333,4.706896551724138
5494521,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"After viewing four episodes of season 4, I am cancelling my DVD order. Some reviews have said things like meh, not interested, tired, etc. and I agree. It seems that the writers tried to Americanize the story. Somehow, the writers forgot that we watched for the simpler time. If I want to see violence I can watch a dozen different shows in the USA so maybe that is what I will do,,,not.

It is sad that the show did not make it the standard five years before toileting. We know it happens, I had just hoped that it would not happen for a few more seasons. Oh well, it is just a tv show, there are many more important things in life.",1389657600,48,633,4.188524590163935
5494522,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Killing off Matthew is a MAJOR err on the part of the producers and directors. The elders in this season are becoming comical instead of compelling. The fury to add NEW characters to this season are seem to be shallow and of no real interest. Let's face it, in the past episodes we cared about the good guys and despised the the mean-spirited, corrupt characters. Now we're beginning to think it's the writers who are mean-spirited and struggling to find issues to keep the series going.

It would have been far more entertaining to see Tom and Matthew work together to save the Abbey and to work for women's rights in merry old England. It would have been far more entertaining to see the doctor and Matthew's mother become an item and work together. It would be far more entertaining to see Daisy become the landowner of her father-in-laws estate and build to something large and in competition to the Abbey or at least the Abbey needing her services.

The niece or whoever she is, is just plain boring, we don't care if someone would kidnap her. In fact, please do we've had enough already.

5494539,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"There is no doubt that Jullian Fellowes can spin a yarn, but fear has clouded his artistry.  I think the hardest reality to face is that the writer did not trust his fans; and that is such a shame.  After loosing Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley), fans were dismayed and hurt; but that was not Follows fault.  He did his best to secure the actor but in the end, Mathew Crawley must be killed off.

Now, this adds a great deal of writing possibilities for season 4, as all the fans go through the grieving process along with the characters of the show.  So, what shouldn't happen?  Exactly what did happen...another shock!  While rising from the loss of two beloved characters, we have to suffer more.  Why add another shock?  Well, to get our minds off of Mathew's death, of course.  This was a mistake, for sure; and one that could have been avoided if Julian Fellowes had been more trusting.  In turn, I believe he has lost the trust of many fans.

Then too,  I think the development of characters is lacking, as they seem to be caught up in a whirlpool type of development which leaves the audience feeling a deja vu experience.  All of which adds up to Downton heading in the direction of, and allow me to coin a phrase from season one, ""the slippery slope.""

I'll not desert the sinking ship, yet.  Perhaps it may still float.  Time will tell if this passenger stays aboard until season 4 docks.",1389657600,28,1396,4.454545454545454

In addition, the characters that everyone loves to hate continually come out on top, which is so frustrating.

We were all extremely disappointed to find out we had just wasted $2 (every penny counts, as far as I'm concerned) to not watch a repeat of something we already watched for free on PBS.

Fellowes is trying to cram too much into each episode, it seemed almost trivial that Mrs Padmore could have been having a heart attack.

I mean, how much heartache and loss can people take before there is just no coming back from that? Then I remembered my own, and realized that through my own life, I have never given up on life or love in the face of tragedies such as these. Losing a child, a spouse, war. The fact is, there can always be a happy ending. There can always be new love. And the writers did a wonderful job of bringing in new plot twists, story lines, and even new loves to soothe our beloved character's broken hearts. And to continue captivating us yet again. Well done.",1389657600,,690,4.2748091603053435

They have brought in lots of new characters, some good and some not so good.  No spoilers here, but I was shocked and concerned after watching the 3rd ep. I'm curious to see how this plays out......
This is the best tv series ever! Its family friendly and even my husband has watched!! Looking forward to watching the rest of season 4!!!!!!!!!",1389571200,,503,4.629213483146067
5494587,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I've adored this series since it first began. I love the comfort of a more genteel era, despite the occasional modern frustration of watching characters who won't communicate about delicate issues. I watch a lot of historical fiction precisely because it's generally free of the grit and gore that populate modern works.

Season Four opened on a bit of a low note. I was saddened by O'Brien's and Matthew's absence, as they both were strong characters on opposite ends of the spectrum. I wasn't pleased to see Braithwaite, because her relationship with Tom seems destined for repetition, and it wasn't very interesting the first time around. His Lordship seems to be retreating into fuddy-duddyhood with all his assumptions, pronouncements, and unilateral decisions that rub wrongly on the other characters.

And then, the infamous Episode Three aired.

Just. No. Omg, no.

The level of violence at the end seemed entirely out of character for the show. The character who performed it seemed to have walked in from a 1970's thriller. His actions seemed illogical and careless, as if he were accustomed to getting away with such violence. Even if the times did support such a conspiracy of secrecy despite facial injuries on various women servants everywhere he went, modern audiences have managed to evolve somewhat. The end result is that the attack scene feels horribly offensive, out of alignment with the show's seasons-long tone, and sewn on from another genre about as subtly as Frankenstein's limbs, All in order to garner controversy, ratings, views, discussion, and other things that drive SEO and publicity.

I'm not watching the rest of the season. I'm seriously annoyed at Mr. Fellowes and his outrageous hubris. If you'd stuck to what you're clearly good at, this season would be more entertaining, but apparently ruining a beloved show is your Get Out of Jail Free card, so you can dash off to America to shoot your next project (as mentioned in a Montreal Gazette interview) without having to listen to us poor besotted fans begging you to come back and make more. If you wanted to be rid of us, Mr. Fellowes, you shouldn't have made Season Four at all.",1389571200,81,2168,4.961432506887053
5494588,2,B00AQVMZKQ,We missed the first episode so we downloaded it form Amazon.  The only version available is the UK version and it ends about 15-20 minutes before the US version so we did not see the whole thing.  Frustrating.  This would be a helpful tip for Amazon to add to the summary.,1389571200,2,272,4.294117647058823

5494592,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"Some of the characters and story lines are become too farfetched, particularly the negativity and evil acts, the most appalling being Anna's attack - how could the writers do that, you did not need this shock value.  Why would the show reduce this very fine production to trashy TV soap opera, with Barrow continuing his nastiness, should be a better person after all the events; the chauffeur Sybil's husband should have risen to his station and not AGAIN be falling for the silly maid, etc.  Again, becoming too trashy, where are the high standards we have come to expect?  Writers beware, we are watching this and not other low moral and TRASHY TV, you are falling into a trap.  I may watch another episode watchng for improvement, if there is none, I will give up.  Redeeming qualities:  Maggie Smith character, thoughtful older characters.
I have watched and purchased for myself and others all of Downton episodes, but may refrain on 4th Season.

Anna is one of the really decent characters they have left and they  destroyed the one pure thing about it. We were so sickened by that scene that my husband has written the show off. I know keeping it real is what ratings are about in all shows but does this show have to be like every other trashy show out there?  I'm hanging by a thread!",1389571200,69,657,4.248

5494598,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I watch Downton Abbey on PBS channel 13.  I have enjoyed the first three seasons.  Love, love.  Last night premiered episode 3 of season 4 and I am totally disgusted with what happened to Anna.  What I witnessed was unreal and very bothersome.  I won't say what as some of you may not have seen it yet.  But I had to get online this morning to read some reviews of other viewers.  Yes, this is a British soap but just as our soap's here in the US can get bothersome and disgusting so can this one.

I agree with so many of the reviews on what they've witnessed.  But what happened on last night's episode was off-the-hook for me!  I might continue to tune it just to see justice done, but, honestly, I'm hanging by a thread.

Raggedy, just raggedy.

In addition, I've noticed that the run time for episode 3 of season 4 is 50 minutes.  Well, on PBS we get a full 60 minute episode and no commercials.  So something is missing from the Prime video and most likely the UK version which I believe is the same.  That's raggedy too.",1389571200,65,1027,4.248704663212435

5494602,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"I've loved this show from the beginning and purchased Seasons 3 and 4. Like everyone, I was shocked at the ending of Season 3, explained by the fact that they hoped the actor playing Matthew would renew his contract, but he did not. Having watched all of Season 4 now, I have to say it feels like the author needed to fill time/space created when a few actors didn't renew, and after watching quite a few PBS and BBC programs, it appears they do tend to recycle a lot of actors through many different programs (and usually, they are very good actors), but maybe there is a limit to the number of ""outside"" actors they are allowed to use, and so it's difficult or too time-consuming to come up with entirely new characters that could require different actors, if there isn't a lot of lead time to plan. And the plot lines suffer as a result.

I still love this show, but agree there are some far-fetched story-lines here, that depend on showing the upstairs family as not very bright or thoughtful, even after all that has gone on previously, and the downstairs people as one-dimensional--either all good or all bad. They've almost turned ""Lord Robert"" and ""Carson"" into buffoons. I don't want to give away too much, but actually, that may be the problem I have with this Season: it's all either predictable or far-fetched, so I just didn't enjoy it as much as the first three.

I know they've said there is to be a Season 5, so hopefully, they have enough advance time to plan story lines, write dialogue, employ actors, and so create a better show for the rest of us to watch. Perhaps, Julian Fellows needs some help.",1389484800,46,1618,4.51877133105802

5494611,3,B00AQVMZKQ,I was so looking forward to Season 4 and now I am hoping that it will improve quickly! I just don't understand how Cora could believe Thomas over Anna. and for Robert to believe that is just too much for me.  I hope this is resolved quickly but have a feeling this will be a storyline throughout the season. The addition of Edna was a total letdown. think it would have been a great story to have O'Brien give her notice in person--which I think she would have--rather than the anticlimatic scene of her sneaking out in the middle of the night.  I can only hope the storyline improves or I will just enjoy re-watching Seasons 1 - 3.,1389484800,20,632,4.302521008403361

If anyone has a chance to watch that scene over again as I have, because I recorded it.  You will just fall out laughing everytime you see it !

So nice not having to get up and look for the dvd before playing it and it will never wear out.,1389398400,,423,3.8181818181818183

5494635,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Season 4, episodes 1 and 2  of Downton Abby are GREAT!  Looks like an interesting beginning to a new season with new characters and interesting problems to solve.  I can't wait to see the rest of the episodes.  Highclere Castle looks better than ever.  I especially liked the sacking of the nanny scene!",1389398400,,303,4.6415094339622645
5494636,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Just started watching this show in the last week.  Really got addicting.  Maybe a bit over-dramatized at times but isn't that what soaps are about ?,1389398400,,148,4.653846153846154
5494637,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"A period piece that lives up to its hype with every episode (so far!).  The start of this season appears very promising, and viewers have not been viewers heretofore it should stimulate them to go back to the beginning.",1389398400,,219,4.615384615384615
5494638,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The high quality of the acting, photography, set design, together with a meticulous re-creation of the clothing, automobiles and furniture of the World War I era draws me into the sometimes funny, sometimes deadly serious stories, several of which are told by each episode.",1389398400,,273,5.2272727272727275

5494640,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 & 3 of Downton Abbey. Then I saw the Journey to the Highlands and the first 3-4 episodes of Season Four. Are Julian Fellows and the series writers just taking their cues from the pulp writer's formula of ""piling on more grief"" or have they simply run out of creative ideas? Not only are they adding massive melodrama, but they are doing in a way such that two major characters are acting completely out of character. This is not how characters grow, this is how they grow stilted and die. About the only two interesting character lines left are Mary's and Tom's -- but these are only touched on sometimes, while the focus is on the melodramatic plot lines. I honestly don't think I will continue to watch the DVD set of Downton Abbey Season 4. It's too sub-standard.",1389398400,30,800,4.524137931034483
5494641,5,B00AQVMZKQ,The accuracy of the period sets compensates for the sometimes predictable 'soap' like plot. The scenes and historical references are interesting.  Maggie is awesome as usual!,1389398400,,174,5.6923076923076925
5494642,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"No matter how much the producers are paying the writers of this show, it is not enough.  The first two episodes of the new season were wonderfully complex, and one feels as though the characters are real.  Superb television.",1389398400,,224,4.717948717948718
5494643,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Have been looking forward to it, enjoyed it, new kindle was terrific, but I felt it was just introducing topics for later shows.",1389398400,,128,4.608695652173913

5494659,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I love the propriety of these characters as they plunge into the true ""age of liberation"" of the 20th Century.  Every character is learning the moral theorem they need to proceed in life, and I can't wait to see what comes next.",1389398400,,228,4.428571428571429
5494660,3,B00AQVMZKQ,They have a lot to recover from with all the deaths of young people in previous seasons especially Matthew. The next couple who gets pregnant on that show should get very nervous given the odds of survival for one of them based on past story lines!! Need some lasting good news for a couple.,1389398400,,291,4.407407407407407
5494661,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Just like so many others! Yes it's a soap opera but so well done. I lone Maggie Smith. She's my favorite. I have loved this time period for years, and women's suffrage, although it's in England. The acting is terrific and the characters well developed. Interesting relationships between the aristocrats, between the syaf and between the aristos and staff. I highly recommend to anyone who loves a well developed story, theme, and characters.",1389398400,3,441,5.054794520547945

5494666,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Really enjoy this program and they always have surprises like the death of Mathew to keep you engaged with what is happening. Is so easy to get wrapped up in what is happening on the screen. This is in my Amazon library so I can watch at anytime and also see the episodes in order if I want to do a Abbey binge watching.,1389312000,,320,4.015625
5494667,1,B00AQVMZKQ,They did not show the death of Mary's husband.  It is already assumed.  Mary mopes around speaking in a monotone voice for the full first episode.  The most exciting event that occurred was the fact that O'Brien left to be a lady's maid for a relative.  Will Elizabeth McGovern learn how to dress and bathe herself?  Stay tuned for that exciting event!!! Yawn.  I fell asleep while watching this.  I do hope it picks up.,1389312000,5,420,4.52
5494668,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Was sad to see Matthew die, his character still had so much growth.  But, now we get to see Mary take charge and that will make heads roll.  I hope they finally build Edith into the strong thinking woman they started last season.  So far a great start.",1389312000,,252,4.208333333333333

5494670,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Best series on tv hands down. The only ones close to it is Upstairs Downstairs or maybe Are you being served.,1389312000,,109,4.238095238095238
5494671,5,B00AQVMZKQ,Long wait it seemed but was worth the wait. Can't wait for next episode. It promises to continue being a classic.,1389312000,,113,4.428571428571429
5494672,5,B00AQVMZKQ,I thought I would not like the show with Mathew gone...but it is just as good...maybe they can work him back in...like in a dream or something...just for our hearts,1389312000,,164,4.5
5494673,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Amazon doesn't seem to like anyone telling you that you can get this free at the pbs website.

5494675,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"The story moves on at a good pace and does not labor a point and drag on & on.

5494677,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"It seems that true effort went into all the effects in this series.  I am amazed by the clothing, the cars and the furnishings in the abbey.

5494679,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Julian Fellowes does a masterful job of describing the differences between the social classes in England in the early 20th century and the struggles each individual in the story endures as he or she comes face to face with the changing cultural standards in a new century - from Isobel's distress that her widowed daughter-in-law should inherit very little from her deceased husband while the widow's infant son is ""as rich as Croesus,"" to Mrs. Patmore worrying that the advent of electrical kitchen appliances will usurp her role as cook.",1389312000,24,539,5.0

5494682,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Seems like their doing a lot of setting up for what will happen. The message seems to be ""moving forward"". If that's the case and there are over 12 episodes, then great. But if not, would give it a star less.  We shall see.",1389312000,,223,4.068181818181818

5494689,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"...and some new people. Downton still has the magic, like going home for Christmas. Downstairs, upstairs, all around the house, the Brits have a talent for this sort of thing.

5494692,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Maybe it just doesn't work without Matthew and no amount of filler can paste it back together! I watch it, but almost am bored. The familiar characters are comfortable, if predictable. The witty lines are few. The clothes are great, Mary goes from widow's black to many shades of purple. I enjoy it as I once did when I watched soap operas after school, to fill my afternoon. Basically, nothing is happening, but another episode has passed with the folks of Downton Abbey.",1389312000,2,472,4.698795180722891

5494710,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Technically speaking, as a production, I find it nearly flawless, other than a few script and character choices. Killing off Mathew because the actor wanted out of the series seemed a poor, poor choice, a senseless murder in my opinion. There must be a thousand other lovely young blonde boys that could have filled the role and I wouldn't have been offended.  If he'd done a good job we wouldn't have missed his predecessor.

Acting, costumes, sets, camera work, music, location, attention to detail...are we sure this isn't a real place and all the men and women real players?  Where the heck is Isis in Season 4?  Did she quit, too? We knew O'Brian had to go, wished it anyway.  Bringing Braithwate back, really, with a new hair color? Glad to see most of the family in tact and downstairs, too.",1389225600,,798,4.631205673758865

5494752,2,B00AQVMZKQ,"After the two deaths during Season 3, both after the birth of a child, I began to wonder if the writers of this show were getting pretty lazy.  After watching the first 2-hour episode of Season 4, I now think the writers are writing in their sleep.  When Maggie Smith seems dull, this show is in big trouble.  Then, we have one conflict after another, as if the writers think the viewers will jump up and turn off the TV if something doesn't happen to someone every other minute.  How many conflicts do you need in one 2- hour episode?  That episode is definitely going to make it easier for me to totally stop watching the show, if I decide to do so.  After reading of the horrific thing that is going to happen to sweet Anna in the next episode, there is a very good chance that I am going to do so, too.  Julian Fellowes obviously doesn't realize how many viewers watch ""Downton Abbey"" for entertainment and escape.  That's too bad and too sad.

Afterthoughts 1/14:  I am really going to miss Violet, Edith, Mrs. Hughes, Daisy, Mrs. Patmore, Anna, Mr. Bates, Mr. Carson, Isobel, Dr. Clarkson, Mr. Molesley, Sir Anthony, Ethel and Miss O'Brien.  I did not watch the episode last Sunday night about Anna, and will never watch another new episode.  I am finished.

I am finished being jerked around by Julian Fellowes, when he's in the mood to add a strong dose of ""realism"" to a show that is ironically based on a fantasy--the fantasy  that the upstairs and downstairs residents were like one big, caring family back in the early 1900s. Mr. Fellowes should have stuck to his fantasies, and continued entertaining us with an astoundingly addictive and fun to watch show.

No, I will never watch ""Downtown Abbey"" again unless I read that there is a new episode where all of the characters on the show, including Sybil and Matthew, wake up screaming one night from nightmares . . . only to have all of their terrors quickly disappear. . . when they all fully awake and realize that Season 3 & Season 4 were only bad dreams . . . very, very bad dreams.",1389052800,17,2049,4.470430107526882

Nothing happened in this episode ,expect Mary moping, a nanny gets sacked because of Thomas' continuing bad behavior, Valentines cards have all the excitement of a wet edition of the daily paper. There is even a sense in Dame Maggie Smith that the zingers she has excelled at , are not filled with the insouciant humor that has marked all of her remarks in the past and she is frankly not sure how to bring them off any more than she can. The changes in dress, machines, etc are done rather than with a sense of humor mixed with anxiety practically without emotion.

5494766,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"My wife and I loved Downton Abbey from the first episode. To an extent, we still think very highly of it.

But we watched the first two episodes of Season 4 last night and, when they ended, heaved a big ""meh.""

There are a number of problems with Season 4 of Downton Abbey:

CAUTION: MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD!

1. Thomas is still there, and still a colossal pain in the ass. Despite being one of the most despicable people at Downton Abbey, nearly universally disliked by every other character, Thomas is still employed at D.A.

2. Now that Miss O'Brien is gone (she left in the middle of the night without telling anyone), Cora Crawley needs a new Lady's Maid. Enter Edna, who more or less tricks her way back into D.A. by answering an ad to be Miss O'Brien's replacement. The character was without scruples when we last saw her; she's not improved now, and quickly forms an alliance with Thomas.

3. So, once again, Thomas is paired with a woman - this time Edna - to wreck havoc on the other servants at D.A.

4. The problem with that is two-fold: (a) the person they chose to stab in the back is Anna. Anna! The sweetest, most compassionate and kind member of the staff; and (b) the Earl and Countess of Grantham actually believe Thomas and Edna when they speak ill of Anna. Cora Crawley, apparently not the sharpest crayon in the box, always took the side of Miss O'Brien, too. But now she's taking the side of a brand new Lady's Maid against Anna! How can that be? Can Cora and Robert Crawley really be that bad a judge of character? When Robert confronted Bates to tell him to keep Anna in check, my wife and I looked at each other and shook our heads. Would Robert have done that? Does he not know what kind of people Bates and Anna are?

5. The fact that we now have nearly the same configuration of characters we did in Season 1, with the nearly the same conflict, tells me that Julian Fellowes is out of ideas. Now he's just recycling what came before, only setting it in a new year (1922, if I recall the super on the screen correctly). Characters who do not change, who remain the same, are really bad, two-dimensional characters. Cora Crawley hasn't changed. She's still a dimwit. Thomas hasn't changed. He's still a manipulating scuzz ball. Bates and Anna are still the moral center of Downton Abbey. But now that Thomas and Edna are set on attacking them, I'm afraid we're ready to stop watching.

We enjoyed Season 1-3 and watched them religiously. A few of them made us cry. We really got into the characters and the stories.

But something feels really off about Season 4. Or maybe something feels precisely on. Everyone is exactly the same. And if all Julian is going to do is recycle the same conflicts (usually with Thomas and his female cohort), then we've got better things to do with our time.",1388966400,692,2817,4.4524271844660195
5494767,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"If you are on Season 4, you know if you love this show or not.

5494768,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"Loved this show. But after seeing the first episode of series 4 it is clear that the original storyline is no longer going to thrill and intrigue us as it did. The Jane Austinish ""entailment"" issue ended with both the birth of little George and the death of Matthew. In fact that could have easily been the end of the series altogether. All the threads had been woven together well enough to call it quits. As Julian Fellows said, Had Matthew lived it would have been a series of scenes where he and Mary discussed and argued about the running of Downton etc. As it is now a whole new group of characters enter in tell a whole new story, while the principles sort of sit back and react but have rather little to do. I'll still watch, as I did the last 2 or 3 seasons of X-Files, but the spark had gone and I'm afraid the same applys to Downton Abbey. I own the series on discs and I think I will do what I've done with other films whose endings I do not like. I'll trim the part where Matthew has his accident and go to Mary lovingly holding her baby and that will be the end of the show. Matthew is driving home smiling and Mary is serene...and they lived ""Happily Ever After"".",1388966400,5,1178,4.1938325991189425
5494769,4,B00AQVMZKQ,"I watched for free on PBS....
The first episode is really different. The characters remain very much in the shadow of Matthew's death. Mary, who has been the major star of the show, has taken a back seat to Edith and the other characters. The upstairs crowd seems to be sharper with the downstairs staff, and it seems like they are less than a family than before. I cannot imagine Cora at this point offering to take care of Mrs. Hughes like she did at the beginning.
Generally, it seems to be more like season 2 were they are in the shadow of war and they are not sure if Matthew and Mary will get together than Season 1 or Season 3 (my favorite) where there is more hope and glitter.
At the end of the episode, things do start to come together, especially in the scene with Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Padmore cleaning the kitchen. I continue to love the relationship between Mrs. Padmore and Daisy. Can't wait to see what the rest of the season brings",1388966400,18,947,4.325842696629214

5494773,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"For those who don't just swoon over something out of habit, I think most actual viewers will acknowledge (with regret) that something is definitely off about the opening episode(s) of DA's Season 4.  To me, the first hour was just tedious with a now very unsympathetic Mary, who actually seems more disgruntled than grieving.  Her self-absorption carries a bitter bite and less interest than usual in anyone but herself, including her child.  However, the second hour picked up, along with Mary's spirits.

Overall though, that unmistakable vital edge we have become accustomed to with DA was sorely lacking, rendering the whole rather flat, acting included.  The scenes in the downstairs area particularly palled for the first time, especially some in the kitchen.  Same great people, but the fire is missing. Even Maggie Smith's parts were lackluster.  There's a point where the best actors cannot overcome trite dialog and boring recycles of old themes.

I had understood formerly that Julian Fellowes is involved in at least one other large project, and perhaps that explains what seems a lack of due diligence to this one.  Even with that, he seems to be diminishing his main characters in stature and depth while escalating devious and underhanded elements. His current presentation appears to be going in the way of his ""Gosford Park,"" where everyone was foibled - and worse.

Whatever it is, overall and in several key areas like the writing, directing and now some of the acting, unless this one picks up with continuing episodes, it is destined to end in a fizzle, a shadow of its former self.

Regardless, I will cherish my first two seasons DVDs as they will always carry the vibrant pulse and excellence that set Downton Abbey apart.",1388966400,35,1746,4.9862068965517246

5494803,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"British viewers have already viewed Season 4, or The fourth series, as we would say over here, and in my humble opinion it's the best one yet.  Julian Fellowes writes brilliant conversation pieces with brilliantly conceived characters.  However, his plots seem a bit improbable at times.  The character, 'Matthew' had to be written out because the actor hungered for greener pastures thereby giving Fellowes the headache of how to remove him from the show permanently halfway through his storyline without destabilising the whole season's plot.
As for the reviews and previews submitted so far, there appears to be a dividing line between those who hunger for more action, and those who feel they have had rather too much of it already.  This stretches our credulity at times, and  those who are looking forward to a little more fun without any major disasters removing yet more of our favourite characters, will have much to celebrate in Season 4.

5494814,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I yield to no one in my appreciation of Julian Fellows's genius.  Downton Abbey is the best thing I've seen since I can remember and Season Four is terrific.  After all the turmoil and tension and bad feeling and heartbreak displayed in Season Three, Season Four comes as a healing wave.  The outstanding characteristic of this season is the flood of love that surrounds this house.  There are all kinds of non-romantic love duos: Violet and Isobel; Rosamund and Edith; Violet and Edith; Mary and Tom; Mrs. Patmore and Daisy, and others.

However, as wonderful as this sense of peace and love is, I find that Julian Fellows has gone off the rails once again and written a scenario that is so implausible as to be unbelievable and this one is the latest in a trend.  Once a year Fellows flits off into never-never land and writes a scene that is impossible to credit.  First was Bates's trial; then we had the episode with Tom Branson's drugged cocktail and now there is the attack scene in Season Four.  Since the producers of Downton Abbey tell us in the bonus material how careful they are to be historically accurate why isn't someone checking Fellow's work before it is produced.

Consider:  with young women today and even teen-aged girls engaging in every kind of sexual activity, with date-rape drugs rampant and after 40 years of women's liberation - men of today look at women very, very differently than did the men of the 1920s.  Most women in the 1920s came to marriage a virgin.  Women were cherished.  Women were protected.  In this environment, therefore, there is no way that a visiting servant would think that he could attack one of the Downton Abbey staff and get away with it.  The perpetrator would have to assume that the victim would tell the housekeeper who would tell the butler who would tell Lord Grantham and although the perpetrator probably wouldn't have been lynched, at the very least he would have been horsewhipped.  Only the viewing audience knows why the victim wouldn't have told anyone and I can assure Julian Fellows that none of us passed that information along to the perpetrator.

Under no circumstances would the perpetrator have returned to the concert, bid his victim good night and casually sauntered into breakfast the next day unless he was insane.  He would have been anxious to put as much distance between Downton Abbey and himself as quickly as possible.  I am not asserting that women were never attacked in the 1920s but this scenario as written is completely unbelievable.

I cannot understand why Julian Fellows, as hugely talented as he is, goes off on these weird tangents every so often and writes material that is so obviously impossible.  These bouts of irrationality are becoming a trademark.  There is another coming up in the 2013 Christmas Special in which a 21-year-old Rose will have her debut season.  I wrote about this in the review of the 2012 Christmas Special where it was hinted at.

We were introduced to Rose at the end of Season Three.  She was 18.  In the 2012 Christmas Special ""one year later"" Rose was 19.  Season Four is six months later and Rose is 19-20.  The Christmas Special for 2013 is going to be about Rose's debut season and will take place in the following year: Rose will be 20-21.  Here we have another ridiculous implausibility.  The only reason why the Marquess and Marchioness of Flintshire would not have had their daughter presented when she was 18 - as everyone else did - was if she was in a sanitorium in Switzerland with TB - or for some equally serious medical reason.

Fellows doesn't even try to explain why the girl was not presented along with all the other 18- year- olds; why her parents would have flouted tradition.  He ignores reality again and again and then boasts of the historical accuracy of the series.  I wonder if there are two Julian Fellows - one rational, talented Dr Jekyll and an irrational persona who every so often comes to the surface and writes material that is so ludicrous as to be unbelievable.  A 21-year-old debutante would be the laughingstock of the season.  Poor Rose.",1387152000,4,4107,4.720505617977528

5494820,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"Absolutely crackling with inaction, positively palpitating with procrastination, and racing along with all the speed of treacle flowing uphill, this Fourth Series of ""Downton Abbey"" really doesn't go anywhere, or advance the story much at all.
Keep your eyes riveted on the flower arrangements during the first two episodes, because that's where all the action is.
And those much talked about production values are definitely slipping.
In the second table shot, ...(there are quite a few), eager eyes will notice that the fish knife of the third place setting is slightly askew. (Ho-hum!)
Oh and later on even those new-fangled electrical appliances manage to steal every scene they appear in. You know you're in trouble when the gadgets become the stars!

It's not until late in episode THREE that anything REALLY happens this time round. (And it's the ONLY significant event in the whole Season too!)
Before that it's just long lingering shots of Lady Rigor-Mortis (Mary) mooning and moping about in a semi-comatose state, dressed in her widow's weeds, and walking as though she has a broom handle secreted somewhere within her girdle.
She's just SO stiff and cold, and only livens up a little towards the last episodes, .....but it takes a tumble into some pig s*** to achieve this. Even that is so prettily handled that it manages to make the s*** look more like the finest Belgian chocolate. Which I'm betting it was for the shoot!
The storyline, ...(if you could call it that), tends to centre on Her Ladyship for this series but her mono-tonal delivery, white white skin, wraith-like appearance and inexpressive acting style are more suited to a haunting.....or a Mrs Danvers role perhaps?

The other characters are not given much to work with here.
Ladies Maid O'Brian is never seen. Just an anonymous pair of legs and a suitcase doing an early morning flit from Downton at the very beginning of Episode One. We are only told that it was indeed O'Brian that was leaving sometime later on.
Bates is reduced to constantly creeping about and lurking in the semi-darkness of the lower corridors looking like some resurrection of Dracula. He doesn't seem to have many duties upstairs as he spends all his time looming from the shadows to accost people and looking positively sinister! His scenes with his wife are actually quite creepy really. He is devoid of any warmth now.
Wife Anna manages some very difficult scenes well, ....but the situation she's in then gets stuck into some sort of hiatus and doesn't really develop until the very end five episodes later.

Long time devotees of this series will no doubt be pleased to hear that Elizabeth McGovern has maintained her acting style of tilting the head forward and peering myopically through her lashes.
It's comforting, because D.A. just wouldn't be the same without that.
The script seems to have forgotten that second daughter Edith was developing as a writer when we left Series Three, and having her articles published in a spirit of independence. It's not mentioned at all here.
Nor is her once fierce rivalry with Mary.
Dead Matthew's Mother Isobel Crawley mutates as we watch from her deep and quite touching mourning into something of a blend between Pollyanna, Florence Nightingale and Mother Theresa.
Maggie's Smith's jowl-quivering Dowager is now falling perilously close to caricature, but again she plays it very well, and her better acerbic one-liners can still raise a laugh.
Downstairs supervisor Mrs Hughes, who gets some of the best scenes to play, turns in a fine performance, but again, everybody is so ""controlled"" that all the excessive histrionics are left for the flighty little piece of new fluff upstairs, who is just so gushy and determined to be ""thoroughly modern"" that she seems to have walked in off the set of some amateur production of ""The Boyfriend"".(I was expecting her to break into ""Won't you Charleston with Me"" at any minute!)
Her cheesy grinning and over-acting was so supremely irritating and she seemed such an unnecessary and superfluous addition to the cast that I'd have left her back in ye banks and braes of the Scottish Highlands.
Dame Tiri Tekanawa has a brief cameo role as Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, although her singing is the butt of some very derogatory remarks made downstairs by the new villain.
Oh and if you'd forgotten just how irritating that damned ""ding-ding-ding-ding....ding-ding"" theme tune can get, .....you are very quickly reminded again. It's repeated endlessly!

I call this the ""Series of Non-Events"".
Some examples here in no particular order. ( I have deliberately avoided any mention here of ""THE ONE BIG DEAL"" in the plot. Anything below is inconsequential.)
MINOR SPOILER ALERTS!!!
1/ Lady Rigor-Mortis has the opportunity to remarry, and to a very promising man who professes undying love.....but she doesn't.
2/Deceased Matthew's recently discovered but unwitnessed will may be disallowed, which would dis-inherit Lady Mary, ....but it isn't.
3/The new triumvirate now running Downton are all set to evict the heir of a very long term tenant from his family holding.......but they don't.
4/ It looks like a new young gardener is going to be unfairly dismissed for stealing bric-a-brac from Maggie Smith's drawing room, ...but he isn't.
5/ Maggie Smith's character is made out to be dying at one stage, ...but of course she doesn't.
6/ The ex-chauffeur now part Downton owner Tom Branson feels out of place in the upper class and plans to leave for America with his young daughter , ...but he doesn't.
7/ It looks like Tom Branson is to be trapped into marriage by an unscrupulous re-employed maid feigning an opportune pregnancy to marry up into the cushy life, ...but he isn't.
8/ It is made to appear that the young footman who has ambitions to be a chef misses his great opportunity at The Ritz, ...but he doesn't.
9/ Mr. Molesley, a desperate out-of-work ex-employee who is reduced to working on the roads appears to have missed his opportunity of filling a recent vacancy at Downton, ...but he doesn't.
10/ Mr Carson staunchly tries to maintain his decision not to have any contact with his old vaudeville partner, ....but he doesn't.
11/ Evil Thomas (yes, he has relapsed since his apparent redemption last season) appears to be planning some great and nefarious scheme to benefit himself, ...but he doesn't.
12/ At one stage there are fears that Bates' wife Anna may be pregnant, ...but she's not.
13/ That new flouncy young thing at Downton annouces she's going to marry a ....Gasp! Shock!.....BLACK band singer, much to everyone's horror....but she doesn't.

There are more than a few other examples, but suffice to say that the plotline consists of so many of these situations that have lots of potential, but then they are just allowed to fizzle out and the story creaks on maintaining the status quo as before.
Perhaps some of these ideas may be further visited in ....god help us, ...Series Five?

Well what did I enjoy I hear you ask?
It must be said that once again there are some most beautiful settings. The apartment of the Aunt in London is truly magnificent. (Furniture and decor to die for!) There are also those aforementioned scene-stealing flower arrangements and of course the exteriors and countryside locations are all breathtaking in their story-book beauty. The briefly glimpsed tenant's farm is immaculate post-card perfection. The vintage cars, motorcycles and London bus are an enthusiast's delight, .....and even of interest to those who just enjoy seeing such well-maintained vintage pieces.
The costumes too are truly sumptuous in their detail, ...although some particular dresses get rather too much wear. This may be a continuity problem but I can't see those upper class women turning up in the very same frock again and again in very quick succession.
Overall the eight episodes are a quick watch.
I managed this in two night sittings, and I guess for me the frustration came from the lack of any real tension, or development of any of the set-up situations. That and the sheer predictability of the thing. You always know exactly where this is going, and that makes it fall into the ""coffee-table book"" genre.
You pick it up just to glance through the beautiful pictures, ...and on that level it succeeds very well.
The potential was there for this to be so much more, but Fellowes seems reluctant to carry on his ideas from his initial concept to some sort of interesting narrative.
The cast move about in front of the gorgeous settings like stilted paper dolls, ..beautifully costumed to be sure but shackled by the author's restrictive idea of period.
Yes, we know that emotions were restrained back then, but it still has to hold interest for the viewer. A cast full of people all so doggedly maintaining that ""stiff-upper-lip"" do not make for engaging viewing.
If half-star ratings were allowed I'd make this a 2 overall, but as they are not I'm giving it the THREE stars, ....and that's primarily for the undeniable visual appeal.

There will of course be those who find all I've written above akin to heresy of the very highest order, but mistaking the style that this show has in abundance for substance which is almost totally lacking will no doubt be a common enough error.",1385683200,33,9279,4.95186136071887

5494822,3,B00AQVMZKQ,"The German politician Otto von Bismarck said once, smart people do not learn from their own mistakes, but from those made by others. By this definition, Julian Fellowes is not very smart... He makes the same mistake so many drama television series have made before him: Too much drama! After killing two(!) most beloved main characters in series three, he just keeps the catastrophes coming (though no more deaths, thankfully). While, on the one hand, some characters suffer terribly, on the other hand, nothing much happens in ""the bigger picture"". There is not enough character development, no progress to the historical aspects like WWI before. Better end a good series with an unspectacular happy ending than let it go on to get hit by tragedies again and again until it dies ungracefully. While the last episode ends without further misfortunes, I cannot help but anticipate the next blow. I adored the last shot of the last episode of series three (note: NOT the Christmas special!): Lord Grantham, a son-in-law in each arm, all three of them laughing. THAT would have been a good ending to a good drama television series.",1384473600,14,1128,4.942105263157894

One thing I like is the eye for detail. They try to get everything right for the period and the year this drama takes place. They obviously do a lot of research on the production and art design.",1379894400,33,412,4.08641975308642

When Season 2 came out, I bought it right away and then when season 3 came out, I also bought it right away.. each time making it a marathon of watching all of it in one big huge Downton Abbey weekend. I am dissapointed that the pre-sale price for this upcoming season has increased so much. WHY SO EXPENSIVE??? Looks like unless they bring it back down, I won't be watching next season.",1379894400,6,528,4.29
5494830,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"With a global audience of over 125 million, Downton Abbey Season 4 is probably the most anticipated show this year.  This number of followers is set to increase as Chinese State TV has, apparently, just started to broadcast it, although what the average Chinese television viewer will make of the antics of the Crawleys I shudder to think!  This time round we pick up six months on from the tragic end to the Series 3 Christmas Special.

Downton has moved with the times, and, as usual, great care has been taken to make the setting, including all the small details, correct for the period.  Hence clothes and hair styles have changed and advances in technology, such as the telephone and even new fangled electric kitchen gadgets are evident.  The cast has all the significant characters who survived the last series, so Maggie Smith continues as the matriarch who dominates every scene she is in, and Shirley MacLaine makes a welcome reappearance after her all too brief involvement in the previous series.  Seeing her sparring with Maggie Smith must be one of the more memorable aspects of this show.  There are some new faces to look out for, one of whom is Kiri Te Kanawa, the New Zealand opera singer as well as a couple of other well known characters in cameo roles.

More of the scenes this time round have been filmed on location in London.  Meanwhile at Downton itself, the antics and interaction of those `below stairs' continues to contribute some very interesting story lines and their trials and tribulations are, in many ways, one of the most interesting aspects of the show.  Above stairs initially Lady Mary is, understandably, rather subdued whilst Lady Edith really seems to be coming into her own having, perhaps, been somewhat overshadowed previously.  The producers have publicly promised no more deaths, at least for a while, but I will not be giving away any key parts of the plot here as I certainly do not want to spoil anyone's enjoyment!

Downton Abbey has certainly continued to go from strength to strength and has confounded those critics who thought it would peter out after a couple of series.  If you enjoyed the previous seasons then Season 4 is unlikely to disappoint, and there is every sign that the show is set to continue.  I do not believe any announcement has been made about Season 5 yet but apparently some of the key figures have already signed contracts for it.  However, personally I would not be surprised to see it run up to the 1930s in due course.  I certainly hope so!

For those of you interested in additional features this set includes 'The Making', The Downton Diaries and New Arrivals.

Edit in January 2014 - Just to clarify following a number of comments on the review.  This review was written when Season 4 was released in the UK three months ago.  The set issued in the UK did not include the Christmas Special episode which is the finale as it was not aired until December 25th.  However, this North American issued set being released on Jan 28th certainly does include the Christmas Special (even though it is subtitled UK Edition!) ie this set as sold here does include the Christmas Special. Hope this makes sense.",1379808000,727,3180,4.73502722323049

5494835,1,B00AQVMZKQ,"1. Anemic drama. Drama is agon or contest, conflict, clash, disputation, etc., between pro- and antagonist, one of each at least. Even when one side is hostile fate or what the gods, God, history, society, etc., fling, throw against the promulgated hero and his cohort. Even when alleged lackeys and other social inferiors, impudent or inept, pester our dear noble sire, they will have some purpose, cause, justification, inspiration, cleverness, or whatever it takes, to make them worthy opponents, make the drama dramatic.

But in ""Downton"" all potentially dramatic conflict is glossed over, brushed aside, too easily, unconvincingly, like dandruff on the Earl's tux. Even the deaths are convenient. The show is more infomercial than drama -- a soft-core selling of certain country mansions and owners. Has tourist traffic there increased? Do more good citizens see the glamour of the top 1% and understand that they deserve more power? That little people should be happy to serve?

2. Strange rituals. A grown man dresses in a tuxedo to visit the bedroom of another grown man and help him, although he is able-bodied, get dressed into a fancier tuxedo, then finishes by brushing dandruff off the man's tux. Solemn, serious, like a religious ceremony. And this today has a fan-club.

3. Hollowness of mind. Indicated by the apparent dominance over the Earl of contact language, the function of language we use when we ask the most asked question in our language, ""How are you?"", and give the most given answer, ""Fine, how are you?"".  Yes, necessary to some extent to establish that both sides know the language and its little rites of etiquette and are quite willing to obey these for the ease of relations or simply to get going. But what if all other functions of language -- and therefore thought and imagination -- and all social issues become mere extensions of this petty procedure and its superficiality, insouciance, and never go past these limits? When all questions and all answers are only repetition of formalities, customary chit-chat, ritualized trifles, signifying nothing but delusional shine around a hollow core or sordid mess? Call it entropy of spirit. What would Hamlet instead say, in mockery? Or Lear's bright fool?

4. The Earl's rite of dinner and coziness of mind and the social hierarchy must not be disturbed -- as if that's the height of all human endeavor: dinner impeccably served. Through the 19th century aristocrats were already portrayed as more often useless or feeble-minded or archaic than not, as educated philistines or hollow costumes on parade, yet still with dangerous power over others, and then were blamed more than others for the blinkered narrow-mindness which led to the disaster known as the Great World War. Yet all this is swept under the fancy rugs of Downton Abbey. Where is the Spanish Inquisition when you need it? And aren't these the people who inspired Monty Python?

5. Two antidotes to ""Downton"":&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Remains-Of-The-Day/dp/B000S6EKXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Remains Of The Day</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fanny-and-Alexander-The-Criterion-Collecton-Theatrical-Television-Version/dp/B000305ZYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fanny and Alexander (The Criterion Collecton Theatrical & Television Version)</a>. In ""Remains"" the butler and housekeeper come to recognize that their superb efforts on behalf of the lord of the manor were wasted due to the latter's sheer banality of thought and imagination, too fogged to clearly see the realities confronting him. ""Fanny and Alexander"" presents drama about European urban haute bourgeoise civilization at its height near the turn of the century, a family engaged both for and against aims beyond smug dinner every day forever.

6. Fellini was a master of Dinner Disrupted. I'd love to see what he might have done with one long Downton dinner not going smoothly. When polite chit-chat and haute ritual pigging-out and obedient servants are confronted by something more substantial and subversive, with humor. My imagined scenario: one or two of the daughters on a trip to London meet a gang based somewhat on the Bloomsbury group and associates, and invite them to Downton where dinner then features the Earl and his family and other proper lords and ladies on one side of a long table, and on the other side characters loosely based on Virginia Wolf, her lover Vita, and Lytton Strachey, J.M. Keynes, Clive Bell, Bertie Russell and Alfie Whitehead, and T.S. Eliot and Aldous Huxley, and Lydia Lopokova too . . .  After more than a few drinks, the guests become impudent, more lewdly loquacious, confrontative and rambunctious. It will end very badly of course, interestingly so. Set it in that cruelest month, April.

7. There are many buildings more admirable than Downton Abbey n&eacute;e Highclere Castle. The Scrovegni Chapel in Padua was financed in hope of atonement by a wealthy family famous for usury and therefore fearing punishment in Hell; Giotto's frescoes there offer a vision of Christianity at its best. The Palazzo dell'Accademia in Mantua was built, organized by aristocrats and other eminent citizens to promote knowledge and cultural advancement; its beautiful theater featured science demonstrations as well as art performances (the first musical evening presented a prodigy named Mozart). One can visit houses where Leonardo painted, Beethoven composed, Kafka wrote --all more admirable than the doings at Downton. Or sit in the Theater of Dionysus in Athens, or stand in front of the remains of Simon the Cobbler's shop where Socrates (not well-dressed) and his gang annoyed passers-by and talked of matters, questions unwelcome at Downton Abbey. I'd like to see more dramas set in these places, about these people. And the Baltimore housing projects in the first season of ""The Wire"" hosted more interesting conversations too.

8. ""Tell me what you pay attention to and I will tell you who you are"" -Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset. The spiritual crisis of our age is revealed by our difficulty in differentiating between low and high, the slimy or stupid and the sublime, the tacky and the transcendent. Our most slavish, crude or mediocre appetitive inclinations have an easy time masquerading as something else. What's really presented for adulation? Call it Golden Calf Worship. Coarse Consumerism Dressed Up But Going Nowhere.",1379116800,15,6496,5.422772277227723
5494836,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"There is no other show on television that plays with our emotions and moods as successfully as Downton Abbey. The classy story of the Grantham family and the parallel world of their servants will involve you, thrill you, make you cry, laugh, cringe, and repeatedly draw you back for more.

Add to that excellent cinematography, rich costumes, beautiful sets and scenery, and authentic dialogue, and you have the makings of a fine show indeed. But when you add to THAT the brilliant human emotion, tangled relationships, colorful, sympathetic characters, wry humour, and a smart, fast-paced plot...you have the makings of near-perfection as only Masterpiece Theatre can make. This is Downton Abbey, and while it is not as epic as Game of Thrones, or as riveting as Breaking Bad or Person of Interest, Downton Abbey is like no other show on television. Your moods will rise and fall with the episodes and the fate of your favourite characters, be it Nurse O'Brien (who we all love to hate), or Edith Crawley (who we all hate to love) and every time you pop in the disc, you will be swept away for a wonderful evening of escapism to the lush mansion of Downton.

The producers really should have sought out a structure that actually looks like an abbey (which Highclere Castle doesn't) or had Julian Fellows change the name of the estate.

The writing is excellent and the story lines amusing and engaging. I enjoyed all of the seasons since and was surprised by the deaths of Sybil and Matthew, but not shocked. Both lead further into great drama and add the suspense of the ""cliff hanger"" for the next season to begin upon. The addition of the naughty cousin Rose may make some new inroads with the story line. With Mary now widowed with a son, and Tom now a widower with a daughter, who knows what tangled plot may now ensue? There is always more backstabbing and sneakiness to be sure between the likes of Thomas and Miss O'Brien, so I think all is not lost. Maggie Smith as the Matriarch is pure gold. She's my favorite! If a face could launch a thousand ships, her expressions could easily wipe out an entire Navy!! She's no sourpuss...she's just a powerhouse!

What work could he possibly have found more worthy to pursue than this classic timely tale of humans becoming more human, and the breaking down of the fable that the rich have it any easier than the poor. Downton Abbey is an important work. It is a piece of history and insight into both the past, present and future. A drama that shows that all of us are not always just good or bad, and the reasons we make the choices and mistakes that lead us all to grow, no matter how many pennies we have in our pockets, or pedigrees we hang on our family tree.

I mean really......He survived the war, not being able to walk, the death of his fiance' and finally helped to save Downton Abbey as well as finally marrying the woman of his dreams and have her love him back and have a son & heir. I hope they find a way to salvage this, please. I do love this show.",1361836800,10,326,4.09375
5494861,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Love the series. Have purchased 1-3.  Hated that Matthew had to be the latest Fellowes victim.  Everything was going so swimmingly with Mary - it just wasn't the right pick!!!  I know the last scene is irrevocable but for heaven sakes, try!!!!",1361664000,20,243,4.738095238095238
5494862,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I was so disappointed and upset with the ending.  Poor Matthew, finally with the one woman he loved for so long........and once again Mary must face heartache. Unless Julian changes his mind and brings this kindhearted gentleman back to Mary and to us.  PBS - thanks to you, I have something great in the viewing arena to look forward to each week.",1361664000,24,348,4.596774193548387
5494863,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"I am so captivated by the story line but hugely disappointed at the unexpected demise of Matthew. It seems as though every series believes they need to end the season with a death. So be it! My only regret is that you chose a character that exemplified the epitome of a gentleman.. Matthew represented, for me, kindness, gallantry and romance. What a pity that he is gone.",1361664000,55,372,4.567164179104478
5494864,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Downton Abbey the most magnetic program on television! Grateful that PBS is making it all posssible. As shocking an ending ever,Matthew was so happy, just full of bliss. After the horror and tears and only being able to vision the impact to follow, I have managed to compose myself and WAIT.The entire house will be topsy turvey.""If"" this is truly to be Matthews end then who will fill the empty arms of Mary and Tom,they are surly not a match but the beautiful young lady from Scotland could be an interest for Tom. She is going to be broke but could mature to bring a match. Each character will be impacted,what will happen in London? What willhappen in the house downstairs? Can not wait for season 4,the intrigue is over whelming!!",1361318400,3,735,4.6183206106870225
5494865,5,B00AQVMZKQ,"Got corralled midway through Season 3 and have now purchased Seasons 1-3.  WOW! What an intriguing series, and Julian Fellowes & Cast have painted an Awesome canvas.  We were breathless at Matthew's early & untimely demise, but I would be obliged to be the ""Midwest Cowboy"" Lord Grantham had previously suggested Lady Mary should find. Waiting on Season 4 will be like settin' on a powder keg with a short fuse.",1361232000,5,411,4.774647887323944
8556647,4,B00AQVMZKQ,Well I had been bashing the writer for the end of season three not realizing it was NOT him who ended that season so badly - the actor left of his own volition. I cannot imagine why someone would leave such a great role in one of the best Masterpiece has to offer. That said I will continue to watch and try to enjoy.  Thank you to the two posters who cleared this up for me. I had thought Fellows had some sort of need to write tragedy .....,1530835200,,442,3.966292134831461
