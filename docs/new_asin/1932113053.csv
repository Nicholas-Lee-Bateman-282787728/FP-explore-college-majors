Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, vastly improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and much cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all.",1120694400,,478,4.150537634408602
