I have all of Anne's DVDs so I can switch between them and not get bored.  I have some mobility issues, this DVD really helps me.  The older you get the more you need to keep moving.",1446768000,,315,3.9523809523809526
8514934,5,B007DBMLNI,Another wonderful video by Anne!  I own all her videos - they're great!,1438992000,,71,4.461538461538462

Thanks for your quick service. MM in Texa",1431302400,,166,4.566666666666666
8514936,5,B007DBMLNI,"I love Anne's CD'S. She has a calming voice and I never feel rushed, I have bad knees and I am very careful to protect them, I can't do any squatting without knee pain, so I do another exercise, by repeating some of the previous exercises. Love her CD's.
Thanks, Joyce",1424822400,2,268,4.2745098039215685
8514937,5,B007DBMLNI,"The DVD is a perfect blend of stretching, aerobics, strength and balance workouts.  It makes exercise doable for every age.  I am addicted to it!",1405728000,2,145,4.76
8514938,5,B007DBMLNI,This is a great workout with a different twist.  I like using the toning ball as something different from the weights.  It gives your fingers and hands a special workout in addition to your arms and shoulders.  I also like the resistance it gives when doing the thigh exercises.,1377561600,5,278,4.63265306122449
