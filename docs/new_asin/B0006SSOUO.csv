2194417,5,B0006SSOUO,"This two-pack set includes the 1999 film Pitch Black and its 2004 sequal,The Chronicles of Riddick. These two films star Vin Diesel as the main character,a escaped convict and mass murderer who is the hero(or in his case,anti-hero)Richard B.

Riddick.

In Pitch Black,a group on a spaceship flying to a planet called

New Meccha to settle it when they collide with a meteor shower

and are awoke for hypersleep. They land on a planet with three suns,which makes tempertures unbearable. With the captain of the ship now dead,Fry(Radha Mitchell),the ship's second in command,must run things and get to a ship that was left behind by a crew of settlers who mysteriously vanished,whether she wants to or not. But in order to get off this planet,she and the crew will have to overcome two obstacles:one,a man being shipped to a prison cell on another planet,who's eyes had been radically changed so he can see in dark places,has escaped from the ship,which puts the crew life in danger and the upcoming eclipse in which,every 22 years,the planet's inhabitants awake from hibernation and roam the planet for one month. Well,guess what year it is? Now,with the help of a recaptured and reluntant Riddick,Fry and the crew must reach the ship and survive the creatures who roam the planet before they are all wiped out. Pitch Black is a very shocking sci-fi thriller with some good scares in between. Besides the fact it mocks religion too much,Pitch Black is a good movie that is worth checking out. It has a story that is pretty good(despite the fact is reminds me of Alien)and has interesting characters such as Imam(Keith David),a religous man,Johns(Cole Hauser),a man who is trying to put Riddick behind bars for money,Jack(Rhiana Griffin),a child hiding a secret,and Rididck and Fry,the main characters. Pitch Black-Five Stars!

If Pitch Black is like Alien,then Chronicles of Riddick is Aliens with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom thrown in a little bit. The story in the first part of a planned trilogy is centered around Riddick,who for five years,has outrun the mercenarries that have been tracking and trying to capture him. Riddick finds out the bounty has been issued from Imam(Keith David),the religious man who has now has a home and has a family,and Riddick flies to Helion Prime,where Imam lives,to get some answers with the merc's ship of course.

Riddick learns that why the bounty was made was that Aereon(Judi Dench),the last of the Elemental race,and who is the air elemental,needs to talk with him. A race called the Necromongers are flying to Helion Prime as we speak to convert everyone on the planet to their beliefs or be killed by them. They are led by the evil Lord Marshall(Colm Feore),a man who is part human and part ""something else"",as the movie describes it(he seems to be able to stretch his body in a ghost like fashion and then his body catches up with him. Riddick learns about his destiny and his past,learning that he is a Furyan,a race belived to be completely wiped out by the Necromangers years ago and this can be used to the heroes advantage because the Lord Marshall fears Furyans. Riddick soon decides that if anyone gonna stop the Lord Marshall's evil crusade,it might as be him. Along with Jack,who has now completely grown up,become a killer like Riddick,and changed her(yes,she's a girl,it's revealed in Pitch Black)name to Kyra(Alexa Davalos),Riddick will attempt to stop the crusade of the Necromangers once and for all.

The Chronicles of Riddick mocks religion way too much,in fact more than Pitch Black did,which is one of the films flaws. Another flaw is that alot of events don't make since,but the next two films should clear up this(I hope).""Riddick"" is good film and you will be entertained. And trust me,if you like action scenes,you will love this film's action scenes. They are the best thing about the film!!!!!!!!!!!So,to conclude,The Chronicles of Riddick gets four stars(so Pitch Black is differently the better of the two).

If you like sci-fi,thriller,or action films,or if you are just a fan of Vin Diesel,you will like this. Also available from the Riddick is the Riddick anime Dark Fury that takes place between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick(I haven't seen it,but I heard it's good)and the XBOX video game Escape from Butcher Bay(which is a pretty good game,from what I played). Both star Vin Diesel. I hope you enjoy the world of Riddick and I hope this review was helpful.

(This review is based on the unrated version of The Chronicles of Riddick and the R-rated version of Pitch Black.)",1129161600,12,4571,4.925974025974026

Universal's proprietary U-Control allows for P-I-P, Pitch Black Raw, Anatomy of a Fight, Complete Chronicles and Chronicles Compendium.  There are numerous deleted scenes, making of docs, a virtual guide and encyclopedia, visual effects featurettes and lots more.  Here are individual reviews of each film:

PITCH BLACK (2000)  4.0 stars

I remember seeing this film for the first time in theaters, not expecting much and boy was I surprised. I liked it then and I like it now, especially on this nice cleaned up Blu ray version. The derivative story features a transport ship on its way to New Mecca, some sort of outpost in outer space. The crew and passengers are all in a condition of induced stasis. When their ship is penetrated by fragments of a comet or meteor, the crew is awakened as the ship plummets to a nearby planet. With the captain killed before he could awake, the ship is now the responsibility of the pilot, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell). She manages to crash land the craft but not before having to eject most of the passengers in the aft sections of the ship.

A handful of survivors includes a group of young Muslims under the guidance of Imam Abu (Keith David), a cop/mercenary known as Johns (Cole Hauser) and his prisoner Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel). The planet has 3 suns and is constantly in daylight. It is barren but for the remnants of a mining camp except no humans are there. Evidence suggest that the camp was wiped out 22 years earlier during a complete solar eclipse. And guess what it's that time again. So why is that a problem? Evidently the only other creatures on the planet only come out when its dark...and they are hungry.

Riddick is not a good guy, but there is some sympathy for his character, but I can't put my finger on why. Diesel does a good job, keeping the guy mean and angry, yet with a small streak of humanity. Riddick has an unusual physical component to his character. He has some sort of artificial eyes that allows him to see in pitch black but require strong sunglass-goggles during daylight. Certainly the film borrows heavily from ""Alien"" and other creature features and once on the planet, it is more horror than thriller or science fiction. In fact some of the science is ludicrous, but who cares. I've always liked this movie and still do. It wears its ""R"" rating with pride.

If some of you like me were contemplating whether to upgrade to Blu ray, make the jump. This 1080p transfer retains the 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the film and it looks great. The first half of the film includes some excellent color rendition, even after the ship crash lands. Certainly the barren planet has plenty of browns in the mix but overall it looks great. The biggest difference however is with the excellent detail in the imagery, especially close-ups of the actors. The skin shows the blemishes, cuts, bruises down to the finest hair follicle. The second half of the film is mostly in the dark with ambient lighting the characters come up with. That is fluorescents, torches, flashlights and such. The blacks are deep and the variations are solid.

The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with subtitles in French, Spanish and English SDH. It is spectacular. The film has plenty of opportunity to flesh out the audio, beginning with the rollicking space ship going down from the space debris. The creatures of the night will have you ducking as they come from everywhere and perhaps most impressive is the sound mix during the heavy rainstorm in the final chapter. Extras include both the theatrical cut and an unrated cut which adds 4 whole minutes to the running time. There are 3 commentary tracks, a ""making of"" documentary, deleted scenes, a visual effects featurette and more.

THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK (2004) 3.0 stars

Here's a surprise, I actually liked this movie a bit better than I recall the first time around. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was the unrated version that I watched. It added 14 minutes to the theatrical cut and although I'm not sure what was added (or deleted), the story (still ridiculous) seemed to flow better. Perhaps it was because I've gotten Riddickmania recently having re-watched 2000's ""Pitch Black"" (still the best), the animated ""Dark Fury"" (2004) and the new ""Riddick"" (2013).

Riddick (Vin Diesel) abandons his loner status in ""Chronicles"" agreeing to help some ghostly species (Judi Dench, earning a paycheck) fight off the Necromongers who are taking over the Universe, one planet at a time. The invading `mongers are led by the evil Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) and his hunky commander Vaako (Karl Urban). Vaako is married to Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton, hamming it up for all she's worth) who is one of those wives that pushes her hubby into power, clamoring for it herself.

The planet currently being taken over also houses the Imam (Keith David) who is one of the 3 survivors from ""Pitch Black."" He's now married and has a cute pre-teen daughter. Of course she brings out a trace of Riddick's humanity. The other survivor if you recall was Jack, the pubescent boy/girl Riddick outed. She's now a very hot (and not just sweaty hot) prisoner located on/in a foreboding planet called Crematoria where it hits 300F degrees. She's now known as Kyra (Alexa Davalos) and is really pissed at Riddick for abandoning her years ago to go do whatever it is Riddick does between films.

Riddick is eventually and conveniently captured by some mercs and sent to the same prison. All of this becomes a bit convoluted perhaps with the purpose of showing off Riddick/Diesel's muscles. And while the production is certainly bigger and in some ways better, some of the CGI also looks fairly primitive. Landscapes for example. While I don't think this ""Riddick"" is terrible, it's not great either. It does have an ending that pretty much sets up the new (2013) film. Once seen as a 3 (or 4) part serial, this will be fun to watch again.

The Blu ray version can also be found as a stand alone disc.  But for the record it is an excellent 1080p transfer.  It comes with an original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  This film is loaded with special sets and some gaudy costumes and the detail and color come off beautifully.  Excellent detail (sweat, beards, pores) and skin tones.  Excellent black levels.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is a stunner.  As you might expect, there is plenty 'o action in this flick and the surrounds and sub(s) and constantly in play.  It's all very cool and quite well done.  Subtitles include English SDH, French and Spanish.

THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK: DARK FURY (2004)  3.0 stars

This is a 35 minute animated sequel to ""Pitch Black.""  It picks up as Riddick, Jack and the Imam escape the desolate planet that killed their shipmates and almost killed them.  They are intercepted in space by a colorful (?) spaceship full of captured bad guys, most in stasis.  The ship is run by a ruthless woman and her evil henchman who eventually turn the thugs into art statues.  Riddick (Vin Diesel) doesn't want to become one and he along with his 2 new friends (Still voiced by Rhianna Griffith and Keith David) must battle the evil-doers and their creative light filled monsters.  This is a decent follow-up by Japanese animators based on a story by the original director David Twohy.  It is fortunately short enough to preclude deeper analysis.

Should you buy the package?  Well, not if you want a Blu ray of the animated film or if you already own Pitch Black and Chronicles on Blu ray.  Otherwise, hell yeah!",1379289600,,7819,4.721323529411765

2194519,5,B0006SSOUO,"This Riddick collection has 3 movies. Two of the titles, Pitch Black, and The Chronicles of Riddick are on Blu-Ray. And Dark Fury is on DVD.
Pitch Black is a sci-fi horror. Riddick is being transported to a prison under a man named John a cop. There are other people aboard this same ship. Everyone is in cryo sleep, when rocks from a meteor storm shreds the ship up. A woman named Carolyn the pilot wakes up and saves a few passengers with a crash landing on an unknown planet. This comes at a cost. Riddick makes an escape, which he is a master at. After watching the movies, and even playing 2 Riddick games, he always manages to break out.

The planet itself is a hot desert. There are three suns on the planet. John eventually does capture Riddick,and to the relief of the now stranded passengers. There's somewhat of a murder mystery happening. They find out Riddick is not the only threat to them. There are carnivorous flying creatures that like dark environments. Riddick himself has eyes that has ultra violet vision, also a reason why he wears goggles in the daylight.
Riddick is unshackled by John after he gets Riddick to agree to cooperate with them. Vin Diesel does a great job as Riddick. You can tell he loves playing the part. He unsettles a lot of the passengers with his reputation and almost non-caring what happens attitude. He personally had a large part behind the scenes of these Riddick movies being made.

Things go even more rotten when an eclipse happens. Riddick has his vision, but everyone else must find their own light sources from flashlights, glowing chemicals, and torches. This is more about stealth, and avoidance of these alien carnivores. The dark is used very well as in never knowing how many of these creatures are there or how close. This never knowing what's out there is where the horror comes in. Out of the three movies, this one does have the less action. But it makes it more suspenseful, when not even Riddick will just go after all these monsters.

Dark Fury is right after Pitch Black. It's an animated 30 minute movie. I can't tell you who's with Riddick because that will spoil the previous movie. Riddick is captured by a mercenary ship in space. Riddick manages to hide himself from the scanners in the small ship he is in. When the mercs open up the ship, they find Riddick attacking and them with less mercs.

He is captured by a woman named Antonia Chillingsworth. She likes capturing dangerous people in the universe and puts them into some stasis. They are aware, but they can't move as living statues. She plans something different for Riddick. She wants to test him out in combat in an arena against 2 tentacle like aliens. This takes place in the dark which is Riddick's environment, as you learn in Pitch Black. It was a fun battle, the creatures have some type of toxin that melts things. While Riddick is fighting them with a knife. There's a nice 1 on 1 battle with Antonia's second in command Junner. He's got a rifle with a bayonet, plus it comes out as a sword. Your bound to see a blade battle.

Dark Fury has a lot of action for 30 minutes. Definitely a bigger change of Pitch Black. Everything is much faster paced. The animator is Peter Chung, who you may remember that he did Aeon Flux on MTV. He has a very unique art style of how he does his characters. The purpose in story is to explain the split of Riddick, and some of the characters of Pitch Black.

The last movie in the trilogy, The Chronicles Of Riddick, is a save the universe story. Necromongers are a cult that worships death. Their goal is to convert as many people as they can and bring them to the Underverse. Their leader, the Lord Marshall, has some strange powers of moving his soul around, and his body follows. Kind of like teleportation. They fly in ships, and invade planets to convert people or kill them. As for Riddick, he's on the run from mercanaries of course. He's been living on a cold planet the past 5 years after Pitch Black. He hijacks their ship to find out who hired the mercs, and how they found him. He learns it's someone from his past, so he flies to that someone's planet location.

Riddick confronts the person who hired the mercs. But also a woman named Aereon, played by Judi Dench, an air elemental. Her people believe in the balance of the universe. She sees Riddick as the best weapon against the Necromongers. She also reveals Riddick to be a Furion. He may be the few or the last of a conquered planet. Riddick like always, is indifferent to what she's saying about the universe ending.

Riddick's own motive is to help someone named Jack. Jack was one of the survivors of Pitch Black. She was 12 years old back then. She also looked up to Riddick. And has anger towards Riddick, for going out on his own without her. Unfortunately, his plan is held back by a Necromonger invasion on the planet that he is on. He battles a few to be only.....captured again. You can guess what happens next. There a good amount of action from the people defending their planet, from sky battles to ground troops. The Necromongers do not care how many of them die in their tactics. They can replenish by conversion. Riddick has a few action scenes here. There's about as much action as there was in Dark Fury in this whole movie.

Unfortunately...again he is captured by the the mercs from earlier in the movie. They want to sell him this time to a prison. The prison planet Crematoria is a chance for us to see Riddick in prison. It's a dangerous prison, in that the planet itself is a death trap. The sun gets so close to the surface, it causes the rocks to burn into ash. There is no where to go without a space ship. It's nice to have an opportunity to see how Riddick handles a prison. We learn in this movie that he's been to other prisons already, and has broken out of them. Butcher's Bay is named as one of them. Butcher's Bay was actually a prequel game to the movie Pitch Black. Dark Athena another game was a continuation of Butcher's Bay. If you like stealth video games, and Riddick, you might try it out or look for reviews on those.

The Necromongers give chase to Riddick. Were in for a big action scene between prisoners, guards, and Necros. He does run into Jack while on the planet. I have to mention her only because that's his only motivation throughout the movie. He wants to help Jack out. Somehow fate gets the Necros in the way of that. Riddick doesn't seem to have much of a choice in matters. It's just like how Aereon predicted of how he was going to confront the Necros and their leader Lord Marshall. You get some flash backs of Riddick's past in this movie. Their weren't any hints in the previous 2 movies.

Chronicles definitely is going for a more complex story with many more different environments. In theaters this movie didn't do to well. One of the reasons was because they spent a lot more money on this movie than the previous ones. And I've heard that some viewers didn't like the death cult angle. I didn't have problem with that. I like seeing Vin Diesel's characters deal with different types of threats. What's different about this is that he never is out to save the universe. There wasn't any point of acceptance of that on his part. Just saving his own life and Jack's.

All three movies are different from each other and fun. There hasn't been many great sci-fi out there, and this for me is one of the top ones.
A lot of the greats were mainly from the 80's, the still talked about ones. It'd be great to see more of them. Riddick, the fourth movie has recently come out this year. If you plan on seeing that movie, you should watch these. Maybe even try the games like I mentioned before.",1378598400,5,7701,4.469416785206259

2194528,4,B0006SSOUO,"My interest in Vin Diesel was renewed over the last two years as Fast Five and Six completely revived both that franchise, Diesel's career, and old fashioned action filmmaking in general. I than remembered that when I was in the 6th grade, I remember watching The Chronicles of Riddick on DVD with my dad. My Grandpa would get random DVD's a lot from costco and this was one of them. I remember kind of liking it. Anyways though, the trailer for the new Riddick Rule the Dark film looks so good (for being so dark and rated R), that my interest in the Riddick films peaked. So, I bought this blu ray box having only seen the final film many many years ago. Here are my thoughts.

Pitch Black (Unrated) - This is a really good sci-fi horror film. Riddick seems to have been tagged as an action sci-fi franchise. But, Pitch Black is barely an action film. There is really only one fight scene in the film, and the rest of the film is more of a character driven survival story. Vin Diesel is really giving it his all as Riddick. You can tell he is going beyond 100% with this character. I like how Riddick is only a supporting character too. Besides that, the monsters in this film are very cool! This is ike a small underrated early 2000s cult sci-fi film along the lines of something like Firefly. It wasn't big at the time but now has a big following. This film is very much like John Ford's Stagecoach too, in that many people who are completely unrelated have to face off against an evil third party that cannot be negotiated with (the creatures). Overall, Pitch Black is a great introduction to Vin Diesel the actor. Some good effects, R rated violence, and dialog make this a solid, and arguably the best film in the Riddick franchise. - 9/10

Dark Fury - So Dark Fury is an interesting little short. The animation is not bad but it is not great. IT doesn't seem to have the polish of other anime shows but it isn't gross enough looking. This story is kind of nice, it sets up some important plot points in the final film. It's also only 35 minutes, which is quite short. I don't have much to say about this. All I can say is that I appreciate what Vin Diesel was trying to do here: flesh out more of this Riddick universe by showing more creatures and bounty hunter type people. - 6/10

Chronicles of Riddick (Unrated) - And the big one. This is a film I struggle with loving very much. I love the film's scope, lead character, action, design aesthetics, and plot. I just don't think that the film pulls them all off great though. The PG-13 really and I mean really hurts this film. Pitch Black features a scene where an alien bites a guys head clean off, little bats rip a girl in half, and a man is shot in the head several times! The goriest moment in this film is where a man's head is cut off, and no blood comes out of him. So, they sacrificed artistic entegrity for a bigger budget. The effects in this look really weak unfortunately. I just don't find any of the big Necromonger ships to look that good. But, I love that once again Vin Diesel is giving his all for this film. They really expanded the universe of the first film into something Dune/Star Wars esque. The design aesethetics really place this film in a Dune type category: a scifi film that serves best for fans of cult cinema. Riddick also racks up a massive kill count in this, which is very impressive. He kills many Necromongers during a huge battle and this scene is the highlight of the film. I also kind of like what has happened to Jack's character from the first film too. There's some groan worthy lines and bad acting in this (Thandie Newton is pretty lame). Overall though, I appreciate what this film was going for, and feel it missed it by just that much. - 7.5/10

Overall: This is a must buy collection for people who love science fiction, action, mythology, and Vin Diesel. These films really know what they exist in and what is their mythology. I love these films even more because of how much Vin cares for this film's universe. All I can say is, you will not be disappointed. You get a great scifi horror film, a decent animated prequel, and a good action blockbuster. 2013's Riddick looks like the best of the series. It's a return to the R rating of Pitch Black, and also continues the story of Chronicles of Riddick. Therefore, I say buy and enjoy. Riddick's 2013 film looks to be the big pay off for fans of this series. - 8/10",1373241600,,4427,4.368932038834951

A transport ship is hit by a meteor shower and crash lands on a mining planet.  They are in fear of their passenger Riddick, a cold blooded killer.  But then they realize the mining settlement wasn't abandoned twenty-two years earlier, but overrun by creatures that come out at night.  So just stay hidden at night seems the answer until they determine there is a total eclipse coming and it will be more than a few days.  Now Riddick may be their only hope for escape.

When I first saw the intro to this movie I was upset by the lack of color throughout, but the movie story itself is excellent and the acting is great.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Casting, directing, acting, sets, locations, camera work, special effects, and music are all great.  This is unlike anything you have seen before.  Well worth owning.

After Riddick after and two others escape we are fast-forwarded five years.  A man is chased across icy terrain by a small bounty craft.  But that isn't the worst of Riddick's problems.  He must deal with a half dead madman taking over the universe.  Fortunately a discovery from an Elemental woman about his past may just give him the edge he needs to stand a chance.

Excellent story and production.  The casting and directing on this one is spot on and the acting superb.  Great sets, locations, wardrobe and costumes, music, and special effects.  Well worth owning.

Cartoon that I wouldn't have paid for if not included in the set.  Gives a short story of how a mercenary ship picks up Riddick and the two survivors after Pitch Black.  The story is mediocre and even if it had been a movie instead of kiddish animation I don't think I would have bought it.  They should have spent their time coming up with a better story, and probably a longer version to bridge the time between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick or a prequel to Pitch Black.

Fantastic. Dark Fury continues to be passed over for a high definition conversion. I get that the cartoon was short, low budget, and a simple form of animation was used, but I see little reason for the mini-movie to have gotten no love from Universal Pictures, other than I feel it was thrown in at the last minute to sweeten the deal. Not that huge of a letdown, I don't know if the conversion would really have looked any better on a 39"" TV, it'd probably be a different story with a 65"" Plasma spitting out 600 frames a second, but I'll cross that bridge when I have an obscene amount of money to get to it.

Pitch Black and ""Chronicles of Riddick"" Blurays are ok. The Blurays are region free.
Great movies, but the quality of the VC1 video encoding could be better - Audio is 5.1 Master Audio on both blurays as advertised.

The ""dark fury"" DVD is CSS region coded ... so it won't play outside the USA (or at least in region-locked players set with the region as non-US).
A quick investigation of the DVD on a PC discovers that it's a single layer DVD with only 3.5GB used - it'll fit on a single layer DVDR without re-compression or video processing required. 20 minutes later using freely available/downloadable software, I had a region free copy that will play in my non-region free PS3 & bluray players.
The low resolution and overcompression of the DVD video provides very low picture quality and it looks terrible on my 46"" 1080p HDTV - it's sad that that universal didn't use the remaining 1GB of space to increase the picture quality of the main movie, or include additional special features. The special features video streams are over-compressed and look terrible.

There is nothing special about this collection, and the inclusion of Dark Fury as a DVD is absurd and unacceptable.
Unless you're a minimalist and don't have the room to store 3 separate cases, I won't recommended this ""collection"" over buying the regular separate blurays. If you're buying it for ""Dark Fury"", under the assumption that it's on bluray, or even improved/decent quality over the DVD released several years ago, it's not and it does look awful.",1301443200,12,1800,4.722929936305732
2194605,5,B0006SSOUO,Nuf said. It was great to see both Pitch Black and Chronicles on Blu-Ray. It was like seeing the movies for the first time all over again. Also comes with Dark Fury so the 3 Disc Set is a hit in my book.,1300838400,3,203,3.744186046511628
2194606,4,B0006SSOUO,"This release has the directors cuts and unrated versions of the full length features however Dark Fury is still only on DVD (it came in today and I've already watched them). So its a good way to own all three features and a solid price and includes all the ""extras"". I'm not sure if Dark Fury will ever be released on Blu-Ray as I don't believe that the animation team had made it at a level that will support it, though it could be remastered...

Just a thought...",1300752000,59,465,4.284090909090909

2194608,1,B0006SSOUO,Don't get me wrong I love this series and the only reason I want the 3 disc BLU-RAY Collection and they give you 2 blu-rays and Dark Fury is on A NORMAL DVD.  HOW CHEAP is UNIVERSAL.  COME ON.  I still love the series and look forward to the next one but this SUCKS!!!!!!,1300665600,39,271,3.9814814814814814
2194609,1,B0006SSOUO,"I have a defective disk; it freezes at 14:00 into Chronicles of Riddick, sits there for awhile, resumes at 16:02, and never shows the Director's Cut, even though this is what I selected.

Because I bought this as a present for my husband's birthday, it was delivered 10 days before he got it. However Amazon starts their 30-day return window when it's delivered, leaving him 13 days to watch it, which due to family commitments he was not able to do.

We're now stuck with a defective copy, and Amazon won't exchange it. While the movie itself is a good one, be SURE you watch your movie before your 30 days are up or you might get burned like we did.",1276819200,2,651,4.371900826446281
2194610,5,B0006SSOUO,"I love these movies (more pitch black than chronicles) but it's a take it as it is thing... it's not Shakespeare, but it is entertaining. I wish they would have tossed Dark Fury in somehow though to make it the complete set. I know it was bad but it served it's purpose... it was a filler story at best but it brought in the Toobs character and gave a relationship between Toombs & Riddick so viewers don't feel like they missed something.

Pitch Black was released under the radar last year and was not perfect but some people are nitpicking a little too much about it:

* ""An eclipse every 23 years that just happens to fall on the day they crash""
NO! the last recorded event of the eclipse was 23 years ago when everyone there died leaving no one else to record the next event... it could happen every 12 days for all we know but there hasn't been anyone to record it since then.

* ""Chronicles of Riddick had better visuals""
Duh! Pitch Black was a pretty low production movie and was released 4 years earlier.

Chronicles of Riddick was OK but I felt they could have gone another/better direction had they not written the entire story around Riddick's origin. To anyone familiar with Dragonball Z it seems all to familiar (Saiyan/Furian) and the whole all powerful tyrant prophesized to be overthrown by a single survivor of a warrior race he attempts to wipe out was kind of weak... a prequel written around his escape from prison that lead to his incarceration at the beginning of Pitch Black would have been better in my opinion.

I've seen some reviews on the 2-for-1 pack complaining that their movie locks up on their blu-ray for the ""director's cut"" but mine played fine and I have a cheap POS blu-ray player that doesn't even support firmware updates. I'm starting to think the firmware updates may be messing with some of these players.",1275177600,,1849,4.557228915662651

2194632,2,B0006SSOUO,"Pitch Black plays perfectly, but for some reason Chronicles is still terrible in this set. Most of the reviews I saw for this product were from almost a 7 months ago and this set still is having the same problem. Basically the Chronicles disc freezes up about 14 mins in and then jumps 4 mins forward and won't even allow for you to rewind from there. What the heck? So much for QA testing. Amazon needs to stop offering this set since this is clearly still a problem.",1264636800,2,468,4.329545454545454
2194633,5,B0006SSOUO,"Just watched these on my PS3 and I had neither playback issues, nor any complaint about the hi-def transfer of the films. Maybe mentioned issues have been fixed? I can only speculate, but if you've seen the films before and like them then the Blu Ray edition (re)purchase is worth the small investment.",1259798400,,302,4.716981132075472
2194634,3,B0006SSOUO,"When I first saw this two movie release I was hoping is was two Blu-Ray disks in one package. It's not. You are getting the two individual movies (in two separate cases) just wrapped in special packaging. At least the disks have all the same special features as the individual release so these aren't cheap theatrical release only kinds of disks. However when you look at the current price for this two movie set you really aren't getting anything special here. I think it's better to just get the individual movies.

Plus a lot of the complaints I hear about Chronicles of Riddick freezing up seem to come from this package set more than the separate movie release. Now if any of you out there have been worried about buying these movies because of that I think it's been a decent amount of time enough for Sony to have either corrected the manufacturing procedure that made that bad batch or for that batch to be phased out. My recommendation is (until there is absolute confirmation there are no more bad copies) go buy the movie at a brick and mortal store that offers returns. If you have a bad copy go back with your receipt and tell them. They will likely just let you get another copy of the movie. If so let then know about the situation. Maybe they can cross-check distribution and all that to make sure you new copy is from a different batch.

The Riddick movies are great and the Blu-Rays look and sound awesome. I just don't see any benefit on getting them in a two pack deal if there are no significant discounts.",1255305600,,1527,4.469534050179211
2194635,2,B0006SSOUO,"All true! The reports that at precisely 14 minutes into Chapter 4 the movie suddenly locks up and freezes happened to my Sony. I pushed the fast-forward on the remote and it jumped to 18 minutes into the same chapter. Not an action scene or anything important to the plot per se, so you I didn't miss anything.

If they have then I suppose it is just a case of poor manufacturing in a batch or two that was at some point corrected along the way.",1239667200,4,556,4.663265306122449

This was the first thing I checked when I got this set in the mail. And guess what, it locks up my Sony BD player at that exact spot - right on the $.
Simply put, a poorly mastered disc. This has nothing to do with updated BD players, but comes down to a disc that was manufactured (or mastered) poorly. Yes, it may play on some players, but it doesn't play on a lot of them (just read the other reviews here - buy at your own risk). Mine is going back for a full refund.
