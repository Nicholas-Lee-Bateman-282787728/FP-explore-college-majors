8537981,3,B00993NI1W,"The film tried to be artsy but failed, in my opinion. It won awards but I gotta figure they must not have had much competition this year. The surfing was predictably good but not earth shattering and the waves were less than inspiring.
The segment in Japan is the reason to watch this video - that portion is pretty damn good and the waves get your blood flowing. If not for that segment, I'd be more disappointed than I am with the effort. Had I previewed the entire movie, I would not have bought it.
There are so many better movies out there. If you're looking to buy something artsy with great surfing and waves, go with any of the sipping jet streams movies. For amazing big wave charging and barrels - who is J.O.B.",1368489600,,721,4.348148148148148
