8333249,1,B001PF741M,"This film has good facts behind it.  What it lacks is dynamic footage.  It is like the camera man asked himself how many angles of the same building he could get.  There is little footage of people & culture.  LOTS of building shoots or landscapes and after a few minutes they all start to look the same.  To make matters worse, it is interlaced footage so tons of obnoxious horizontal lines during pans & movement.  Good facts bad footage.

If you must watch this, rent it.  You'll learn something from it because the information behind it is good.  I wouldn't buy it though (Unless you're really into seeing the same building hundreds of times).",1337040000,2,647,4.605263157894737
