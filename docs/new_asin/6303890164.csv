727526,5,6303890164,"I am so happy to have this wonderful miniseries and know that it is available for fans and for a new audience.  When it first came out, it was an earlier generation's introduction to British country life in the beginning twentieth century much like Downton Abbey is for today's audience.  The story begins with a wounded Boer war veteran Paul Craddock coming to take up residence at Shallowford House and become the squire of the Devonshire valley of Sorrell.  The miniseries covers a time span of almost twenty years, following the lives of the inhabitants of Shallowford House and the Sorrell Valley and Paul's struggles to be a caring and effective land owner.  This is definitely a good choice for those who enjoy family sagas, period dramas, and most especially those who are interested in the time period of Downtown Abbey series.  Based on the novels of R, F. Delderfield A Horseman Riding By provides another look at the way of country life before and after the modern age.  The wrapper contains the warning that due to the age of the production viewers may see flaws in either video or audio.  I did not notice either as a problem, and whether that is due to my love of this miniseries or the excellence of the story and acting, I cannot say.",1422662400,4,1251,4.633484162895928
727527,5,6303890164,"A Horseman Riding By. (1978). Paul Craddock, (Nigel Havers, CHARIOTS OF FIRE), who has been wounded in the Boer War, and discharged from the army, returns home.  He uses an inheritance from his fathers London-based scrap-metal business to buy Shallowford, a neglected Devon manor house and estate.  He soon becomes a much-respected squire, determined to treat all his tenant farmers fairly, unlike his predecessors. This classic BBC television miniseries from the late 1970s unfolds slowly, chronicling Craddocks life, the changing times, the approach and the end of the First World War.  It is based on historical novels by R.F. Delderfield, depicts the end of an era as England moves into the modern age. The series was filmed in the beautiful English countryside, at the Devon shore, where it is set.

The boxed set consists of  13 episodes on four discs, running approximately 673 minutesor 11 hrs. Mind you, due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution that DVD provides, the viewer may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio on this DVD presentation that were beyond the studio's ability to correct from the original materials.  The entertainment also offers subtitles, thank goodness, and thank you RLJ/Acorn, needed in a production this old, where the actors are trotting out their best rural accents.  I received this as a review copy.

In addition to Havers, ( also seen in EMPIRE OF THE SUN, A PASSAGE TO INDIA, DOWNTON ABBEY), the series features the Welsh-born Glyn Houston,( THE CRUEL SEA, DOCTOR WHO) as John Rudd; Prunella Ransome, (FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD), as Claire Craddock; Fiona Gaunt, (WAR & PEACE), as Grace Lovell and Philip Martin Brown, (TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY), as Sam Potter.  The acting is uniformly strong, the scenery gorgeous, and, as was the way in the 1970s, the sets/clothing/transport, accurate and evocative: the first appearances of motorized vehicles are a treat.

The episodes are, with thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn:

We really liked this excellent series, featuring many well-told stories, and gulped it down about as quickly as we humanly could.  Despite the fact that it does move slowly, and sure stops to smell the roses, beautifully.  No onscreen violence, blood and gore, nudity, profanity or sexual situations.  And if you like this period of time, English history, social history, this ones for you.",1420761600,8,6083,5.097683786505539
727528,5,6303890164,"A FULL REVIEW OF AN EXCELLENT 70'S BBC SERIES

STEWARDSHIP OF THE LANDED GENTRY AND A CHANGING WORLD.  In this small Devon area valley, much of the old ways for the gentry are already failing and the new prospective squire is not a nobleman.  He is ""new money"" trying to build something different for himself in a rural life he has yet to comprehend.  As he comes to love the valley for which he becomes Squire, he combines his slightly more modern ideas with the well established ways of working class families who have cultivated that land for centuries.  However, his desire to improve his tenants' lives does not sit well with noblemen in nearby estates.  Adapted from the first novel in a series by R.F. Delderfield.

THE STORY (No spoilers):  LT Paul Craddock is a wounded army officer returning from the second Boer War in South Africa.  The year is 1902 and he has inherited a great deal of wealth through a scrap metal business his father possessed in South London (for which Paul had little interest).  With this new wealth, he considers buying an estate in a valley in Devon that was once owned by a noble family called Lovell.  Squire Lovell lost his land and wealth through poor financial management and now lives abroad as his family gives him just enough money to stay away.  However, his genteel but progressive daughter Grace Lovell still haunts the estate from time to time.  As Paul reviews the estate, he finds that he is being auditioned by the local tenants just as much as he considers the investment and interviews the estate manager.  Though Paul comes from new money, he gravitates to the lives of those who live on the land and need a benevolent steward.  There is also a conflict of love and position as Paul quickly befriends the elegant, yet wildly modernized, Grace Lovell who's union could help establish his sense of belongingness to his new position. Opposite her is Claire, a very beautiful and capable woman who is also the daughter of a tenant.  Not exactly noble.  As Paul goes about repairing the neglect of the properties, he must battle his affections and esteem for both women and decide which will suit the stewardship of his position best.  He must also struggle against the other land owners who fear trouble from their own tenants if Paul succeeds too well in his modernization.  Certainly some estates in real life must have gone through these challenges of meeting the 20th century.  This show walks a strange tightrope of characters who had liberal ideas for the time, yet greatly desire to preserve an old way of life for rural inhabitants.  Whether this tale is historical, realistic, or not, it is a wonderful saga of honor and altruism, an endeavor for the good of those we serve.  As I intimated before, the core of characters are no longer noblemen and the classes are already mixing and improving themselves as the story progresses.  It extends through the travails of WWI and deals with patriotism, duty, and sometimes complexities of war (it is not a war movie).

FINAL THOUGHTS: This is a great story by any standard.  Just keep in mind this is 70's BBC drama so the pacing may be a little more methodic than some modern audiences are used to.  For those used to 70's BBC, that's just part of the charm and the attention to character development is very welcome.  If you like the genre, you should love this show!",1419033600,77,3372,4.671186440677966
727529,5,6303890164,"The chronicle of a young man making a life for himself on a country estate. It is finally released in DVD format 36 years after the miniseries was aired on BBC. It is typical 1970s cinematography (no HD but it's enhanced) so it appears a bit washed during exterior scenes. Don't let that deter you, it's good nostalgic historical costume drama, family friendly. The story more than makes this a keeper DVD. Now on DVD with subtitles.

The content is a wonderful look at class lifestyle in England during WWI. Sets, costumes, and dialogue all unite to offer a near history perfect look back a full century.
4 lead characters bring Devon's Shallowford estate into a romantic presence. The episodes covering 1902 to 1919 depict all manner of events, good & bad. The Valley community, rich & poor, possess the same inner determination to carry-on through thick & thin. A delight!
Glyn Houston plays John Rudd, estate manager for life. Claire Derwent Craddock (Prunella Ransome) is a local born also. Paul Craddock (Nigel Havers) tries to save Swallowford and The Valley. Grace Lovell (Fiona Gaunt) is daughter of Swallowford's previous owner. Valerie and Wendy Holloway twins play the poor renter Potter family twins with much humor for their man-hungry ways.

If you like Nigel Havers, a young man in 1978, then this is for you. He arrives back in England from the war in Africa, he buys some acres of land known as ""The Valley"" which has tenant farmers. The first Squire has died, and the land etc. needs money to bring it back to it's original state.

Fell in love with the lovable characters and didn't much like the ones who ""rubbed me--and I suspect others---wrong.""  I lived in England for several years and know the country fairly well, although I shall forever be a ""Yank.""  The filming is breathtaking, and convinces ""us""  the reason for Paul Craddock's falling in love with and subsequently purchasing the Swallowford estate after he returned from one of England's turn of the century wars, is justifiable indeed.  Love connections abound among the characters, whether they be among Paul's farmers or involving Paul himself.  The romances are wonderful if you are a romantic, or even if you are not, since all liaisons are intrinsically bound by place and commitment to the land or to timely political causes.  I loved it--and was very caught up in each episode, of which there are many.

The story of a Boer War veteran who buys a rundown valley estate and his struggles to bring it back to prosperity in the years 1902 to the end of WWI is truly moving.  If you like Upstairs/Downstairs or Downton Abbey, which over the same period, you'll like series.  I found the print and the sound ( subtitles available) to be very good. The various characters who inhabit the estate farms are well-drawn and handled well by the new squire as he tries to earn their love and respect.

So, having come across the series ""A Horseman Riding By"" I expected the same excellance in the TV adaptation.  Alas,  not even close.  It's a bit like an amateur high school play.  Nigel Havers is OK, but many of the other characters are almost cartoonish, they are so one dimensional and miscast.  But worst of all is the dialogue -- it's often laughably poor.  At some point Paul's second wife, totally out of character, decides to sleep with a visitor.  The whole episode is preposterous and out of place.

The TV series really gives you and exceptional view into the British class system before everything changed with The Great War. The main character is played by Nigel Havers.who did and outstanding job of bringing Paul Craddick to life on the TV screen.  One of the things I really like about Delderfield's books is the characters he creates. The people are humble, real, loving , giving, and connected to the earth. Yes, there are the villains but the emphasis is on the righteous. This series was a challenge to edit because it really starts in 1902 and ends in 1965. Even with just concentrating on the years of 1902 through1919 many things are not adapted into the screenplay for TV. I would highly recommend reading his other books. The BBC adapted another one of his books with the title To Serve Them All My Days. They have and older and newer version of this TV series.

The happy ending is great too -- LOL !",1425254400,,257,4.446808510638298

728033,5,6303890164,"If you love watching things that take you to earlier times & prettier places you'll like this little ""trip"".  If you like hearing the reasoning of hearts and minds in British dialogue from the early 1900s you'll recognize the same thinking in people all around us today.  I particularly thought the portrayal  of people left at home during WW! & the references to the effects of Spanish flu which followed it to be interesting.  The acting isn't stilted as I'd expected, & although there is a note on the DVD, of apology for limits in being able to update the video for recent release, I didn't notice any flaws. Just a lovely journey to another time & country.",1424995200,3,661,4.576271186440678

728086,5,6303890164,"This wonderful series aired in the late 70s so what a treat to find it now released by Acorn, splendidly remastered. It is an adaptation of R.F. Delderfield's novel and is set in the wonderfully unspoiled Devon countryside. The visual and production details are exquisite, the characters are irresistible and although the series spans almost 20 years, you'll find yourself yearning for more. This is a series to be enjoyed and savored, although you'll be tempted to binge-watch to see what unfolds next. I cannot even pick a favorite episode because they're all exceptional to watch as stand-alone entertainment, or to link with the next chapter. You'll feel immersed in life in Devon even as the world's changes signal a shift from country life in a bygone era. Highly, highly recommended!",1424649600,,790,5.038167938931298

7855120,5,6303890164,I just love the miniseries from the 70s and 80s. It's as if you are reading the book. Great story. Although they almost left out the family aspect all together by having almost no children of the squire and his wife in the story and only speaking of them. That was strange. But it was still a great miniseries all the same.,1517443200,,323,4.225806451612903
