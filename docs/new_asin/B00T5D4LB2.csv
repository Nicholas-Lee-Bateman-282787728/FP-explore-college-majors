7000222,5,B00T5D4LB2,"A lot of ppl make fun of me because of how obsessed I am with this show!!! Every Thurs I am in front of my TV from 8-9pm, whether its a new episode or a repeat!!! During down time, when the show isn't on the air, I scour the internet for spoilers and watch all the seasons that I own....and the second a new season is available for purchase, I buy it!!! So I'm totally obsessed, but ppl who don't watch the show just think its another silly high school soap opera or a washed up version of Twilight.....but ppl who DO watch the show know its SO much more than that!!! So all I can say is: If you are on the fence and not sure if you should give this show a shot, DEFINITELY give it a shot!!! I guarantee you'll be sucked in after 1 episode. But you cannot start with season 6, or any other season except season 1!! Start from the beginning, this show is so fast paced that if you don't start from the very 1st episode, you'll be very confused!! I can't wait for season 6 to be available for purchase and for season 7 to start again!!! Its horrible having to wait 4 months to buy season 6 and 5 months for season 7 to start!!! Oh well, I guess I'll just pop in the first disc of season 1 and watch seasons 1-5 (and then watch season 6, which is recorded & saved on my DVR until its available for purchase) to tide me over....and I'll keep searching the internet for any & all spoilers on the upcoming season!!!",1433721600,9,1409,4.071942446043166
7000223,4,B00T5D4LB2,"I was honestly about to give up on this show.  It seemed without Klaus and his siblings around there was no real drama anymore.  I will admit the first few episodes leave a lot to be desired, but they do set up a great storyline that has changed the face of the entire show.

The most surprising pairing of the season, Damon and Bonnie.  These 2 actually work well together and have great chemistry, and I believe we are going to see great things from these 2 going forward.  They are going to give Stefan and Caroline a run for the oddest friendship that works in the best way.

The biggest standouts this year are Damon and Caroline who go through enormous emotional ups and down that were great to watch.  Alaric is also back and as usual spends a lot time getting kicked in the teeth by life.

Everyone enters a dark place sometime this year.  Matt and Bonnie though begin to spiral into their own dark places due to the never ending beat downs they seem to take for being mortals among immortals.  They have finally seemed to cross over emotionally from child to adult.

I also loved the new villains.  Without giving too much away the witches we have seen in the past are nothing compared to what is coming, and the one leading them will hit close to home for the Salvatore brothers.

There is laughter and sadness but overall everyone's lives are changed by the end of the season, and the tantalizing cliffhanger in the last 30 seconds only makes me want more",1431648000,21,1466,4.425373134328358

7000227,3,B00T5D4LB2,This show was amazing! It was the first show that I had dedicated everything to!! I would never miss an episode and every episode was just better than the last!!!! But these last couple of seasons I don't know what has happened. I don't even care about the love story anymore. I'm a huge Stelena shipper but i know if I want Stelena moments I have to rewatch the first three seasons. How many more times is Bonnie going to die??? I loved the season premiere!!! Which gave me hope for this season but quickly it downspirled. Plec is ruining the show. These last several episodes haven't even been exciting. I love this show and i have no plans on giving up on it but I really hope season 7 will be the last season because this show is going no where.  It feels like Delena is being forced JUST FOR THE FANS. What happened to Caroline and Tyler??? This show does not make sense anymore,1424736000,21,883,4.319277108433735

7000236,3,B00T5D4LB2,"I am not reviewing the content except to say that I love The Vampire Diaries.

A friend wanted the series on Blu-ray and was missing certain sets so I went about getting it for her, and got a set for myself as well. With Season Six, there is a case issue. Not all cases will be broken but I ended up buying four of this, three from sellers here and one at Best Buy in person, all four cases were broken. The plastic was noticeably thinner than the plastic for the mega-sets on Seasons Three, Four and Five but also different from the plastic on One and Two, so that may be the reason. A weaker, thinner case for only a few discs, as compared to the odd sets they made for the sets of Blu-rays combined with DVDs, would explain such breakage and eco measures to thin out the plastic, thereby using less of it to make each case, would appear to explain the difference from the early sets. Seasons Seven and Eight were fine, thicker plastic. I ended up returning all but the used one I bought for myself and then got her a gift card to get herself this season, so she could decide how to handle it.

As for how to deal with it, they sell individual cases for these sets  all over the place so, I'll get to the point finally, if you are buying this and get a broken case that is not too terrible, just keep it as many are broken and some are just terribly cracked and chipped and basically falling apart. What you exchange it for will likely be worse, on Season Six only. If you get a really bad one, you can exchange or return for a slightly damaged case or the elusive intact case, you can opt to buy a replacement case for five dollars or so, from a random vendor, or of course you have the option to just deal with that case.

Essentially, this review is a warning that if you are purchasing this particular season as a gift, on the clock as it were, then you should leave enough time to exchange it or to purchase a replacement case before you need to to pass it on to the recipient. Again, this is an isolated issue with the Season Six set of The Vampire Diaries on Blu-ray. All other seasons appear to be made of slightly thicker plastic. Good luck finding what is right for you and, in case you are just reading reviews to decide on whether to get this, like all of The Vampire Diaries, it is a wild, fun and dramatic ride that is absolutely worth taking, if you love vampire stories and lots of beautiful men kissing lots of beautiful women. Enjoy.",1509321600,3,2453,4.212765957446808

I don't want to give away what happens like some of the other reviews here, but I will say like always this season keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love all the twists and turns of the storyline. I would like to see a comeback of the Originals, they are my all time favorite villains. Definitely better than Twilight. You fall in love with the characters, then you hate them, then you love them again. I feel like the negative reviews stem from the fact that sometimes something happens to a main character and they think the show isn't worth watching anymore. C'MON GUYS!!! It's Vampire Diaries..... They almost always come back later on somehow. And the actors are brilliant!",1487980800,,768,4.613138686131387

As a review of the show itself, I grew up watching The Vampire Diaries and I still think it is the best show out there. Especially the first couple of seasons, you will be very addicted and so driven into their world, you will fall in love with characters and hate others, but the plots and twists are just insanely good.

7000279,5,B00T5D4LB2,"The end has come !!!! well at least for Elena  Booya..... Still very good season with lots of witches, half breeds, more damon misery and more Stefan gets all the happy moments.

I kinda lost interest in VD after Originals came on was more interested in what Klaus and the other old vampires did.  Wish i could of watched more but luckily there is bluray, the internet, and vudu for all my backup purposes needs.

cant wait for season 8 I hope all the old characters make a appearance or Elena comes back and so does Stefan/Damen Mom too.  Wouldnt be a series finale without Elena at least or her ghost form, descendants etc.

now where did i keep the popcorn gotta rewatch this too along with supernatural to catch up.",1474934400,,719,4.450381679389313

This season was bittersweet because this will be the last one that my birthday twin Nina Dobrev will be in until the series finale whenever that is. TBH the series should end once this current season (season 7) ends, but rumor has it a season 8 is upon us. Not to mention, how Kai ended up killing his entire family on his twin sister Jo's wedding. I was filled with joy when Damon knocked his head off. My favorite episode of this season was the last one, because of the memories shared between Elena, her BF Damon, and her friends before they had her bestie Bonnie (Kat Graham) seal her away in a magic proof coffin. On the bright side in season 7 Kat gets a lot more screen-time.",1459209600,,783,4.297297297297297

The season itself is good, not as good as the first three seasons but much better than the 4th and 5th. But this show is getting a bit repetitive, I haven't watched the ongoing season but I'll wait til is over, if the show is cancelled then I'll watch the 7th because it would be like the last one, but I won't watch the show anymore if they keep going for more...",1456358400,,422,4.146341463414634
7000322,5,B00T5D4LB2,"BIG IMPROVEMENT. Season 6 was an improvement; Bon Bon seemed to get a backbone and Damon had some Elena-Free time and a new ""friendmance"" was born with Bonnie and Damon after the events from season 5. For those that haven't seen it - check it out and judge yourselves. I bawled at Caroline's song at the funeral - won't say who's but my word it is so beautiful. I really enjoyed this season.",1456185600,,391,4.36986301369863

7000326,2,B00T5D4LB2,"This has to be the worst VPD season. The entire season was waaay too depressing, one of the most depressing shows I've watched in a while. I hate how they killed so many people off. Is this all they can write about? Geez. The story about Caroline's mom getting cancer & dying totally broke my heart, I cried so many times while watching it. This was the first time I felt really happy the season was over, usually I want it to last forever, but not this one! I also hate that Nina Dobrev/Elaina left the show, it won't be the same without her. I sure hope the vampire diaries starts getting better or I won't be watching anymore. To me, the best seasons were the first few & when the originals were on there... now there's just something missing.",1455580800,,746,4.335714285714285

(TVD surpassed Twilight hardcore) Honestly though...disappointment set in due to the constant back and forthness between Damen and Elena. Can we say whiplash? Damen is by far my fave and keeps me watching regardless, but he DESERVES the girl dag-gum-it! Anywho...the show is worth the watch and once you start, you will continue. Bonnie and Caroline...you rock. Stephan...ehh. Tyler...sexy as a hybrid, not so much now. Jeremy...boring. Aleric...was awesome, but went down the poop shoot. Matt...ugh. Elena...WTF? And DAMEN...be still my beating heart! All in all...show is great but they need to mix it up a bit and lay off the witches. (Overdone). Show could use different, new bad guys. Or just bring back the Originals... ;)",1448841600,,896,5.1020408163265305

I hated what they did with Jeremy and Matt and even Tyler. & I'm so starved for Bonnie,that I'm heartbroken...I'm sad that I may be dropping it for season 7, if I don't like the first episode or believe it will pick up :'(",1447027200,,576,4.342592592592593

While I have enjoyed this season there were things I didn't like and stuff I immensely enjoyed. I own every season the vampire diaries. I watched the entire first season on tv and I will continue watching it. I have always enjoyed Ninas portrayal of Elena so very much and was crushed when it was first announced she would be leaving. I don't think the series will be what it was before but the cast is so amazing I have great hopes for the season.

At this moment, I have not gotten to watch all the special features but what I have seen are great. I always enjoy the gag reel. Get to see them mess up lines when they are always spot on in the show. Being a fan of the vampire diaries, this is quite must have.

During down time, when the show isn't on the air, I scour the internet for spoilers and watch all the seasons that I own.and the second a new season is available for purchase, I buy it!!! So I'm totally obsessed, but ppl who don't watch the show just think its another silly high school soap opera or a washed up version of Twilight..but ppl who DO watch the show know its SO much more than that!!! So all I can say is: If you are on the fence and not sure if you should give this show a shot, DEFINITELY give it a shot!!! I guarantee you'll be sucked in after 1 episode. But you cannot start with season 6, or any other season except season 1!!

7000426,4,B00T5D4LB2,"The Vampire Diaries: The Complete Sixth Season picks up several months after the fall of the other side. Most of the main characters are living in denial and disillusion as they attempt to move on after losing two of their best friends. Rather than grieve, however, Caroline (Candice Accola) has chosen to fight to reverse the spell keeping them all from returning home to Mystic Falls. Elena (Nina Dobrev) copes with Damons death by drinking a magic potion that allows her to interact with a counterfeit version of Damon. Stefan (Paul Wesley) plays at being a mechanic and becomes involved romantically with a local woman, but hes still in contact with Alaric (Matthew Davis). Tyler (Michael Trevino) is once again human, but lives in constant fear of triggering his werewolf curse. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) chases random girls, plays video games, and seems to care little for anything but his own pleasure.

Episode 1, Ill Remember, spends a sizable amount of time recapping earlier events and acquainting viewers with what the characters have been up to since the other side disappeared. The episode disorients before the plot puzzle pieces are reassembled. The final scene is witty and intriguing as it sets up the questions that will be addressed during the season.

The show derives its popularity from smoothly integrating horror, fantasy, and romance genres with a generous shot of soap opera melodrama. All 22 episodes of Season 6 are included on the 4-disc Blu-ray release. Bonus extras include 2 new featurettes, 2014 Comic-Con panel, audio commentary on 2 episodes, gag reel, and unaired scenes.",1440892800,4,1609,5.090909090909091
