3905881,5,B002CGT0TW,"I bought this movie a few hours before seeing the 70th Anniversary of The Wizard of Oz on the big screen. This movie is incredibly funny with a bunch of sex jokes, toilet humor, foul-mouthed strippers, and much more! Rob Zombie can make a very good cartoon. This is the story of a washed-up Mexican luchador named El Superbeasto who tries to be an action hero along with his beautiful sister named Suzi X. Together, try to stop Dr. Satan from marrying Velvet Von Black. I loved all the silly dialogue and the spoofs of Michael Myers, Captain Spaulding, and at one point, the film, Carrie is made fun of! I highly recommend THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO!!!",1253750400,,661,4.563025210084033

3905883,4,B002CGT0TW,"After a great many years in conception and production, horror director/artist/metal legend/all-around bad mofo Rob Zombie hath finally bequeathed unto us his animated masterwork ""The Haunted World of El Superbeasto"". Was it worth the wait? Well, it's a mixed bag to say the least, but if I told you I didn't have a great time I'd be lying to you. What we have here is a twisted tale of stupidity that bombards you with cartoon breasts and behinds, potty humor, racial caricatures, homages and cameos from every corner of the entertainment universe, a truly bizarre comedic soundtrack that sounds like a collaboration between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tenacious-D/dp/B000MCH5RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tenacious D</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-the-Conchords/dp/B000P2A6C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of the Conchords</a>, and general Rob Zombie madness like you've never ever EVER seen before. Sound good? Hop onboard.

What's the story? Who cares? It's dumb. This film is about chaotic, childish glee. It begins with a classic black-and-white Universal move by giving us a friendly warning that what we are about to see may horrify us. He's not wrong, but the movie is far from scary in the traditional sense. It takes on an animation style similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ren-Stimpy/dp/B0002NY8XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ren & Stimpy</a>&nbsp;and utilizes devices and sound effects from all of the innocent classic cartoons we grew up watching. Then all the girls take off their clothes and use prehensile female anatomy in ways that make you embarrassed to be watching then you see your favorite horror characters and get all happy and then all the tailkicking starts and there's Nazi werewolves (Zombie really likes Nazis..and werewolves...and especially Nazi werewolves) and zombies and Nazi zombies and they have their own theme song and then there's more boobs and this transforming robot that's all horny for this awesome chick who steal Hitler's pickled head and Superbeasto is a luchador who shoves a cat down his pants so he has a bulge and there is Dr Satan who is really a nerd and has a talking gorilla with a screw in his head then all this stuff happens and it's crazy as fu.......[deep breath].....Yeah, so this flick gets a bit crazy at times.

So I think we've established that the humor in this one is decidedly lowbrow. Let's talk homages, references, and cameos. It's pretty much the biggest draw here unless you are one to pleasure yourself to cartoons (which is okay, as a song in the movie informs us, because Japanese people do it every day....nice). Plenty of horror icons ranging from Dr Phibes to the Bride of Frankenstein and The Fly as well as characters from Zombies' own films, but then there's references to everything from Benny Hill and Jerry Lewis to Charlie Chaplin (who Beasto mixes up with Hitler) and movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver/dp/B000R8YC18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B000E6ESEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Apes</a>. Other amusing cameos of note include Courtney Love, the Olsen Twins, and a featured role for Michael Myers.....as street pizza. This is an infinitesimal sampling. Honestly, aside from the sheer twisted insanity the massive unending pile of homages and cameos are what is going to keep your interest for the full hour and twenty. This has to be some kind of record. Eat it, Tarantino!

Voice cast. Awesome. Rosario Dawson lets fly some of the most staggeringly ignorant ebonics you've ever heard onscreen. Normally, I'm unimpressed by this cheap style of humor, but in this particular setting it did the trick for me. The Mexican caricatures, however, go down as a fail in spite of the marvelous man-god Danny Trejo lending his voice. Getting a real Mexican to play a caricature just doesn't sound funny, I guess. Tom Papa is pretty much The Man playing the title character. He has a really classic voice and delivers the lines with the perfect amount of sleaze and glee. Rob's wife Sheri Moon Zombie was born to be a voice actress. As cute as she is onscreen, when she's reduced to just a voice to an animated caricature her gigantic personality is just unbelievably charming. Again, big thumbs up for the cast.

Throw in some self-referential humor (including a song that plays during an homage scene stolen from a classic horror film that laments the cliche parody and asks if they got permission to do it) more cartoon boobs and ebonics slang, and even more cameos and references and that pretty much sums it up. The special features are a few minutes of extremely brief deleted scenes (one has Leatherface in it) and a very long set of unfinished alternate scenes. I'd have hoped for at least a commentary or making of after all the delays but whatever, Zombie. ""The Haunted World of Superbeasto"" is a great time if you're looking for a cartoon to keep as far away from your children/parents/grandparents/girlfriends as possible. You may not get away with all of your brain cells intact, but you'll probably leave with a smile. A stupid, stupid smile.

3 1/2 stars rounded up because I have a strong urge to watch this again.  Soon.",1253750400,17,5484,5.569544364508393
3905884,5,B002CGT0TW,"Did anyone of you out there in zombie land ever see Heavy Metal or Fritz the Cat?  Well, if you haven't then Rob Zombie's second directorial offering of 2009 might actually shock you a bit.  Think of this as a perfect hybrid of Crumb/Baskshi collaboration with some Ren and Stimpy thrown in and blended into a parody of 70's Hanna Barbara cartoons.  Yup, when Zombie said this was like an X-rated Scooby-Doo, I got what he meant after viewing it.  It's not literally Scooby-Doo guys, it has more to do with the fast and cheap toons churned out in the 70's by the Hanna Barbara Studios.  Think Johnny Quest with an obsession with horror and Sci-Fi pop culutre and the most tasteless and outrageous visual gags, mostly revolving around weird sex, and you have this film.

This is a perfect exploitation cartoon.  It wears and loves its influences like old sweat pants that have been transformed into pajamas.  The jokes are fast and broad and mostly tasteless.  The dialogue is witty and sharp.  Plus, it provides an interesting tutorial on how many different ways one can describe or refer to a certain part of the female anatomy.  I warn you now PC Police, this 77 minute cartoon is loaded with foul langauge, mostly too outrageous for anyone to seriously be offended by, tons of animated nudity of every variety, human male and females and 'other', graphic bloody violence similar to that of a Japanese cartoon.  Though, seriously, how could anyone truly be offended by the violence in this?  It's so silly and over the top.

Zombie has gathered together most of his Halloween, Devil's Rejects, and House of 1000 Corpses acting troupe and a few new ones to lend their considerable voice talents to the many colorful denizens of The Haunted World of El Superbeasto.  Rosario Dawson(who appears as a nurse in a deleted scene from The Devil's Rejects involving a nasty meeting with a bed ridden Dr. Satan) is hysterical as the foul mouthed, gold digging stipper, Velvet Von Black.  She puts her tone and vernacular on full 'ghetto' and gives some of the most sidesplitting line readings in the entire film.  Paul Giamati, new to Rob Zombie land, plays Dr. Satan(no not the same Dr. Satan from the 1000 Corpses) and he gets to play it broad, and even sing concerto.  He is really quite funny and twisted on the level of The Monarch of The Venture Brothers, but sexually adventureous in a graphic way and bit perverted.  Ken Foree shows up for a few lines as a cat that Superbeasto uses to stuff his pants!  Sherri Moon Zombie is in fully baby doll voice mode to play Stacy X, Superbeasto's super sexy, constantly nude, butt-kicking, eye patch totting, gun weilding little sister.  Moon Zombie pulls a Baby Firefly but on the side of good this time, so instead of the cute as a button-ness indicating fear, it's just cute and quite funny.  Brian Posehn(The Sarah Silverman Program)who is one of the best comic/writers out there voices Stacy X's transforming robot.  The 'bot has a huge jonze for Stacy X, who wouldn't?  And the modifications in regard to how she now as to ride him as he turns four-wheels is perfectly tasteless and hysterical.

There's a great scene in a strip joint that plays out like a Daffy Duck cartoon.  If you look in the background at the various patrons horror fans will spot some of their icons.  My favorite being the suicide emploring chest bursting alien.  Even two members of the Devil's Rejects show up in animated form.  Otis gets to get the last word this time.  Oh, and Michael Myers is directed by Zombie for a third time and gets run over about as much as the Michael Myers concept already has been for the last 30 years.  Good one Rob.  Though my favorite bit cooked up for this insane-fest of a cartoon is a song during the ending cat fight.  A fully nude cat fight.  It's almost as if Zombie could hear his critics calling him a perverted debaucher more in regard of the animated nudity and in-your-face sexuality, and less over the animated violence, but beats them to the punch.  A song about the pleasures of masturbating to animated characters, just like the Japanese, plays as close ups of various nude body parts of our fighting temptress' tussling it out.  Really funny.

The Blu Ray unfortunately is sparse with the special features, which is a surprise considering it was released by the always reliable, and extras heavy Anchor Bay.  We get some deleted scenes which are really seconds short vignettes that were taken out of the film, most of them not that funny.  We get alternate takes and alternate endings as well, and I can safely say that Zombie went with the right ones in the final film.  The most interesting feature on the Blu Ray is the fully film in its animatic form.  I'm a big animation buff and any chance to see the original pencil sketches in their full glory is always a pleasure.  Speaking of the animation it is quite wonderful.  It is most closely akin to The Brothers Grump or Ren and Stimpy.  It's very elastic and full of energy, and many bulging....bulging things.  Many bouncing things too.  But that's it.  No commentary, which Zombie usually provides and very well, and no docs regarding the film's origins or basic creation.  This is shocking due to the fact that on Zombie's Halloween remake and The Devil's Rejects dvds he has 3 plus hour documentaries regarding every inch of production, and these makeing-of docs are created in-house by Zombie and his hired crew.  Oh well, I guess this perfect monstrosity speaks for itself.

Bottom line is this film is crude, rude, twisted and loaded with enough kinetic energy to fuel any mouse mascotted conglomerate.  There's lude jokes, nudity and/or manic violence on the screen every other second.  It's tiring and it moves so fast that you may want to watch it again right after it's over.  If any of the above mentioned actually 'offends' you then please skip it and skip the conservative review regarding it.  Thos out there with a touch of the twisted, please grab this up right away.  This is the best film Zombie has made since The Devil's Rejects(which is his best film).  Huh, and it's not a remake or a sequel...go figure.  Though, it is a comic book movie, but it's based on a comic book that Zombie himself created so....whatever.

Any film that has a foul mouthed stripper getting married to an ex-geek who has had his face altered to like look the devil, so said ex-geek can garner the powers of the darkside, and the priest is played by or at least resembles the mutant from This Island Earth has got to be at least worth a rent!  Right....?",1253577600,7,6578,4.649913344887349
3905885,2,B002CGT0TW,"Fans of Rob Zombie love him for what he is, warts and all. His music if fast, loud, abrasive and great to drive to. I'm a fan of his music and think he puts on a great show in concert.

His movies are something else altogether. Where HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES showed some promise of things yet to come, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS felt like more of the same through a different lens, trading in 70s style horror for 90s style realism. HALLOWEEN felt like he took a gem of a film and ran it through his own meat grinder resulting in a movie that didn't pay tribute to the original and offered nothing more original to the story with the exception of placing it in his world rather than that of the subject. It was disappointing enough that I didn't even try to see the sequel.

So what is Zombie's world? It's a world filled with over inflated breasts, strippers, crooks, monsters, masked wrestlers and more. In short, all the things that most exploitation film makers try to overcome. Instead, Zombie embraces these points from those films and puts them to use in his own movies, not always to the benefit of the project at hand.

So this week we see the release of Zombie's animated feature film THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO. Based on the comic book character Zombie created a few years back, the main hero (?) of the piece is a semi-washed up luchadore (masked wrestler) named El Superbeasto (Tom Papa). His claim to fame is being a hero and a spokesperson for any product that puts money in his pocket. He also stars in his own porn films.

When not fighting crime or making movies, El Superbeasto tries to hit on anything in a dress and in possession of Dolly Parton size breasts. Such is the case when he spies a new stripper at his favorite club named Velvet Von Black (Rosario Dawson). But she's caught the eye of another person as well, the evil Dr. Satan (Paul Giamati) who intends to make her his bride thus fulfilling a prophecy that will grant him enormous power.

Sending his brain enhanced gorilla to capture her, El Superbeasto must track down the newest girl of his dreams. Knowing his limitations, he enlists the help of his half sister Suzi-X (Sheri Moon Zombie). Suzi is a hero in her own right, more so in fact. Accompanied by her robot Murray (who secretly lusts for her while not so secretly displaying his passion), Suzi is in the midst of taking on Nazi zombies for possession of the head of Hitler in a glass jar. But she'll do anything to help her brother.

Clues lead them both separately to the lair of Dr. Satan where they arrive a bit too late. The marriage has gone through and the powers are about to come into play with the evil being. Can El Superbeasto save the world and stop him?

The movie has its pluses and minuses. On the down side is the fact that this world is a trash filled locale and not one for children to glimpse. Some have called this film Zombie's FRTIZ THE CAT. That film had more genuine humor. This one tries to get in the face of the average person while winking at the cool cats who dig Zombie and his world.

On the plus side is some fantastic animation. They've done a great job at both giving us fluid movement not seen in most animated films these days as well as some dynamite character creations. Also good are the cameo appearances of numerous cult figures from Tura Satana (star of FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL!) to Zombie's characters Otis and Capt. Spaulding from his first two films.

So what's the end result? Hard to say. Fans will love this one as much as they've loved all else Rob Zombie has offered them. Many will say that squares just don't get the jokes. Then again most of those will be kids under the age of 20.

Those who aren't Zombie fans will most likely not be swayed to become one after this movie, unless animated breasts are a must fill need you have. While it may seem they've been mentioned too much here, the fact is they fill the screen from beginning to end.

For me the film was okay at best, terrible at worst, but for the most part left me feeling indifferent. Having actually been one of those people who checked out the comics this was based one, I expected more. But having a deep rooted love of great animation I enjoyed that aspect as well as the cameos. Too bad the end product left me wishing for a different story.

Thinking back to watching this the fact is I truly wanted to like it. And moments I did actually do so. But on the whole it failed to deliver for me. Was I offended? No, but anyone with children should be aware this is definitely NOT a kids film. Was I entertained? At times but not the entire length of the film. Would I recommend it? Only to die hard fans of Rob Zombie or people who are fans of horror film tributes, schlock films and exploitation films.",1253577600,6,4769,4.382352941176471
3905886,5,B002CGT0TW,"Whether or not you are a fan of Rob Zombie's music or films is irrelevant, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is a pure blast.  If you can, imagine Fritz the Cat minus the political commentary and double the nudity and violence, as Zombie adapts his own comic to tell the story of professional wrestling super celebrity Beasto (voiced by Tom Papa) who is on a never ending adventure of action and babes.  He and his hot, Nazi-zombie hunting sister Suzi X (voiced by Sheri Moon Zombie) embark on a quest to rescue foul-mouthed stripper Velvet Von Black (voiced by Rosario Dawson) from marrying wanna-be world conquerer Dr. Satan (voiced by Paul Giamatti).  In the middle of all this are plenty of ""I can't believe what I just saw"" moments, blink-and-you'll-miss-them visual gags, hilarious songs and music, and plenty of animated graphic ultraviolence; so much so that you can't help but enjoy what you find here.  Yes, as you can probably tell by now, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto isn't for everyone, but if any of the aforementioned sounds appealing in the least, you are almost guaranteed to love this animated flick, regardless whether or not you're a Rob Zombie fan.  Also featuring voice work from Zombie regulars Brian Posehn, Ken Foree, Geoffrey Lewis, and cameos from Sid Haig and Bill Moseley in their House of 1000 Corpses/Devil's Rejects roles.",1253577600,26,1363,4.883116883116883
3905887,5,B002CGT0TW,"I love Rob Zombie's music, but I've never connected to his films at all. Until now. El Superbeasto is such a bizarre, depraved, joyfest that I couldn't help but smile through the entire movie. It combines the best of Zombie's visual flare with his twisted sensibilities. It has luchadors, a female heroin with an eye patch, Cholos,zombie Nazis,a wonderfully foul-mouthed burlesque dancer, and a villain named Dr. Satan voiced by Paul Giamatti. What more could you ask for?

I hope Zombie will incorporate some of the story techniques he learned from El Superbeasto into his feature films. He is such a talented artist, but his features just don't tell stories that I care about and rarely have characters with any redeeming qualities. I can see him becoming a director mentioned in the same breath with the likes of Martin Scorsese if only he would turn his lens on flawed characters, but ones that have at least a shred of humanity. Travis Bickle is a borderline sociopath, but he redeems himself by trying to protect Jodie Foster's character by going after her pimp and his cronies. Zombie had a co-writer on El Superbeasto (Tom Papa, who also voices the hysterically self-absorbed luchador protagonist). I hope Zombie continues to work with writers in the future, so we can witness his incredible vision, but get out of the nihilistic gorefests he's served up so far when he is the lone writer and director.

I agree with the review that said El Superbeasto is really not an X-rated Scooby Doo, but instead would describe it as Ralph Bakshi meets Looney Tunes. And what a beautiful meet and greet that is.",1253318400,2,1608,4.822463768115942
3905888,5,B002CGT0TW,"Rob Zombie described this film as an X-rated Scooby Doo.  I don't know if its that but it is funny, surprisingly clever and entertaining.  More of an X-Rated Ren & Stimpy with classic Universal Studios horror stars making appearances throughout.

The animated adventure follows the hero, El Superbeasto, his heroic sister, Susi X, Dr Satan who is bent on world domination, a talking lab assistant gorilla, Werewolf Nazis, and Zombie Nazis.  The disc has some ""A"" list voice talent including the actor who voices Spongebob but this is definitely not for children.

My only complaint of the disc is the lack of special features.  No commentary, background documentary, or insights from the director.  The  Directv pay paer view at least had a short introduction by Rob Zombie.  It would have been nice to have that on the DVD.",1252800000,2,824,4.913043478260869
3905889,4,B002CGT0TW,"i think the only reason this movie wasn't rated X was because it was animated.it definately has all the qualities present in low level porn.the animation is like a 1970s-80s cartoon.it involves all the same goofy sounds and slap stick routines, funny facial expressions,general silliness  and what not.the violence is beyond severe.it reminds me a lot of ""itchy and scratchy"" from ""the simpsons"".the music is very before rock and roll like the music from ""who framed roger rabbit?"".only the lyrics are like something off of ""south park"".
  rob zombie did the comic book this was inspired from.he also drew for ""beavis and butthead do america"" during beavis's peyote trip and directed the movie ""house of 1000 corpses"".no the dr satan from that is not the same dr satan from this film.
  this movie is about a lucha libre star[mexican professinal wresler],a big shape shifting droid and a sexually obsessed crime fighter chick taking on nazi bikers,a permiscious ,cussing wanna be chick,a giant gorilla and yes,dr satan to stop the end of the world.
  so if you could stand the goofy,dizzying breakneck pace of old school cartoons,you love porn[even animated],and can stand ultra violence all to the tune of 1000 cuss words a second,this movie is for you!
  if you dislike even one of those elements,skip it because the movie is full of all of them!

3906005,5,B002CGT0TW,"Ever since I was about 11 years old I've loved Rob Zombie's music. By the age of 13 I saw House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects which I both liked. Then at the same age I woke up one morning in October an hour before school started and  my brother put on The Haunted World of El Super Beasto, I just adored the film to death. Eventually the film stopped being shown on TV. Now at the age of 16 I got this film for my birthday and right away I was swept back into my favorite animated movie. I'm a horror fan so I can spot all of the homages, characters, and tributes, which was and still is fun to do.

The Story: El Superbeasto is a writer/director of exploitation films, he was a wrestler and fights evil forces while also being a suave and at times a dope. Suzi x who is a secret agent and his sister works with Superbeasto. Suzi X has a side kick which is a robot named Murray that is based on the Robot from The Phantom Creeps (1939). Murray can do all kinds of stuff and really wants Suzi X if you get what I mean. Together the trio fight Hitler who's head is in a pickle jar and his nazi zombies as well as other monsters. Superbeasto has an arch nemesis, Dr. Satan who has a side kick Gorilla named Otto. Otto is able to talk and is highly intelligent, in the end he and Velvet Von Black stay together. Dr. Satan is planning to take over the world and it's up to Superbeasto, Suzi X, and Murray to stop him. The film takes place in the fictional place of Monsterland not to be confused with Toho's monsters' home, Monster Island.

The Good: Even though Superbeasto is basically an idiot he still is quite likeable. The whole cast of characters are likeable. The film is well acted, well written, well animated, has great dialogue, is funny as it's meant to be.

The Humor: There's some high brow humor but most of it is toilet humor but here even the toilet humor is great. The jokes work and it was overall a funny film.

Tributes and homages: The opening of the film is a parody/tribute to the opening of Universal's Frankenstein (1931), "" Mister Rob Zombie would like to heed you a warning. We are about to unfold the story of El Superbeasto. What you're about to see may shock you. It may even horrify you. So if you'd not like to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to well, we warned you."" Que Frankenstein (1931) score. Now that is awesome. The Bride of Frankenstein or The Monster's mate makes an appearance. The creature from the black lagoon makes a cameo. There are werewolves. Michael Myers gets hit by a car. The Invisible Man has a cameo. Jack Nicholson has a cameo. Dracula has a cameo. The Fly from The Fly (1958) has a cameo and Medusa does too. Otis and Captain Spaulding from House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects  make cameos. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have a cameo. Boo Berry and Frankenberry have cameos. There are cyclopses all over the place. Frankenhooker and a mermaid show up. Edward Scissor hands, Alien, the mummy, Nosferatu, and Jason Voorhees all have cameos. There's a Planet of the Apes reference. There's a King Kong reference. Leatherface and the phantom of the opera have cameos. There's a Carrie reference, ""Mark my words Steven they're all gonna laugh at you."" ~ Otto. Dr. Phibes from The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again has a cameo, Dr. Phibes was played by Vincent Price in those 2 films. The Metaluna mutant from This Island Earth makes a cameo. There's a second Carrie reference, at Dr. Satan's wedding Beasto and Suzi drop pigs blood on Dr. Satan. Frankenstein's monster has a cameo. An alien from They Live (1988) has a cameo. The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers has a cameo.

Fun Facts: The film started production in 2005. The film is based off of a comic by Rob Zombie.

Run time: Fairly short, 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Its about El Superbeasto, a celebrity of sorts in a Mexican wrestler's mask, who falls in love with a stripper and must have her.  Unfortunately, Dr. Satan saw her too and has her kidnapped by his gorilla henchman so he can marry her in unholy matrimony.  El Superbeasto must save her in order to keep Dr. Satan from becoming all-powerful and taking over the world.  He enlists his sexy sister and her robot sidekick to help him in his mission.  The jokes come fast and furious and there are a ton of sight gags.  Fans of Zombie's films will see cameos of some of the characters from those films.

3906025,4,B002CGT0TW,"I finally broke down & watched this animated feature because it came on so much on the premium Movie Channel. WHAT a film! Imagine everything movie classic-wise; King Kong; Zombie Nazis; the Mexican wrestlers who were in their own monster-battle movies, i.e., ""Santo & The Blue Demon"", etc., etc. Then imagine all that old ""damsel-in-distress"" fodder that was the secondary subject of those films, and their having an ironic ""twist"" in the usual outcome. And it all works! I LOVED the ""damsel-in-distress""-like abduction of Miss Velvet von Black, a dark-haired white beauty who talks with classic ""ghetto"" foul-mouthed ambivalence after being kidnapped by a big, hairy gorilla. And the ironic twist of that gorilla arguing with her in  proper British intonations to where she finally falls in love with him! Anymore would be to add to the humorous and artful ""standing on one's head"" of not experiencing the ""usual"" response to El Superbeasto's haunted world. It's a world populated by all our favorite goulies and ghosties of famous horror films; robots, Frankenstein monsters, vampires, werewolves, Freddie Kruger, the Phantom of the Opera, et.al. And THEY all have to be saved from Dr. Satan's (voiced by Paul Giamatti) takeover of that world. And to the rescue rides El Superbeasto (voiced by co-producer Tom Papa)with his Mexican wrestlers voiced by Danny Trejo, et.al., and Beasto's sexy sister Suzi X, voiced by Sherri Moon Zombie. It's a WILD, WONDERFUL, fun-filled ride of XXX rated (but tolerable) sex, drugs, bloody fights, you name it. It's creative and downright fearlessly imaginative.

3906028,4,B002CGT0TW,"I'm not a Rob Zombie fan, whose work as a producer-director-writer-actor ranges from television series episodes to wannabe hip horror and sci-fi flicks.  But I'll make an exception for the animated feature THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL BEASTO, an incredibly juvenile, bad taste little flick which also happens to be extremely funny.

The story concerns the title character, El Superbeasto, who seems to be a part-time wrestler, part-time porno producer and star, and part-time hero--and (not surprising inasmuch as it involved at least eight writers) his story is complicated.  It seems there is a underground bad guy named Dr. Satan, and if he can marry a woman with the number 666 on her backside he will be endowed with all the power of hell.  The lady in question is noneother than stripper Velvet von Black, a sexy white woman with a remarkably profane eubonic turn of phrase.  Dr. Satan arranges for Otto, his servant ape, to kidnap Velvet, but by this time El Superbeasto has seen her perform and has fallen in lust.  He therefore enlists the aid of his adopted and sexy sister Susie X, who pauses in her battle against Nazi zombies to help him rescue Velvet, who is actually more than capable of taking care of herself.  Needless to say, everyone is soon in Dr. Satan's cluches.

There are two things that make this film really memorable.  The first is the endless parade of references to other films, ranging from FRANKENSTEIN to THE FLY to PLANET OF THE APES to THE SHINING to THE GODFATHER to CARRIE--a parade that is often quite witty and which clips along with such speed that you'll probably have to watch the movie two or three times to catch them all.  The second is Velvet von Black, voiced by Rosario Dawson, who is beautiful and sultry, has hilariously powerful breasts, and the foulest mouth this side of a sewage drain.  Indeed, the character is so profane that you can't quote many of her lines without offending the powers that be.  The dialogue play between Velvet and Dr. Satan's gorilla minion Otto, voiced by Tom Kenny, is nothing short a comic jewel.

Even so, THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  There's a lot of nudity, bouncing breasts, sexual depravity, singular perversity, and endless, endless profanity.  And the film is uneven: when it connects, it knocks the ball out of the park; when it misses, you roll your eyes to the ceiling and wonder what the creators were thinking.  Still, it's fun enough, warped enough to rate four stars for me.

3906032,5,B002CGT0TW,"So I finally got around to watching this and guess what? It's freakin' awesome. In fact, it's even better than Bridesmaid. The reason I make the comparison is because I watched both films back to back. While Judd Apatow acted only as a producer for Bridesmaid the flick is nevertheless filled with potty humor and F-bombs. But then again so is Superbeasto. Many may say that The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is silly and cliched, but so is Bridesmaid. The big difference here is that Superbeasto is actually good as opposed to that Bridesmaid crap that made millions at the box office. The beauty of this flick however is that although it treads on familiar territory it does so within a very cool storyline, and very cool characters as well.

Susie X is perhaps one of the coolest characters ever. Yes, she's a cartoon that kicks ass and lets it all hang loose. It's funny because she's the actual hero of the story while Beasto is only after the girl. Yet he gets all the glory. Said ""girl"" Beasto is after is none other than Velvet Von Black. And while Susie X is cool personified, Von Black is perhaps the most annoying character ever conceived. The final showdown between the two is just classic awesomeness.

Although the jokes are silly, the story line is much FUN. Yes, it's a linear story and you pretty much know how it will end but the way the story progresses, along with the likable characters, is what really keeps you wanting more. Remember that this is not intended to win any Oscars. It's intended to be enjoyed for what it is.

Genre: Action | Animation | Comedy | Horror | Thriller
Director: Rob Zombie
Run time: 77 Minutes
Language: English
Rating: R for strong crude and sexual content throughout, nude graphics, language, violence and gore.

In all honesty, I do not like Rob Zombie as a film maker. I find his work rather boring, and I feel as though he tries to give his movies entirely too much comic relief.
Anyway, this movie is based upon the comics he created about a wrestler/actor/director named El Superbeasto. Basically it's a cartoon movie that closely resembles a porn movie, which is even in the beginning of the film. Some might say I'm uptight, well this movie is entirely too profane, and rather disgusting. It does have some funny scenes, but the level to which this movie goes, out weighs the humor.

If you're interested in animated strippers, nudity, nazi zombies, crude language, crude humor, I'd recommend this film. But if animated porn isn't your venture, I don't recommend it.

All in all, I give this film a rating of: 3 stars.
Don't go out of your way to find this, but if you're bored, and a friend owns a copy, and you have nothing better to do, give it a watch.",1268697600,,1219,4.6036866359447

Imagine a guy in a Mexican Wrestler mask, that loves porn, who has a super hot sister, that fights Nazi Zombies, that is trying to save a stripper from a dweeb who wants to be Satan.....

3906045,4,B002CGT0TW,"Rob Zombie has been on the receiving end of far too much criticism in his career as a filmmaker. Nearly every one of his films have had mostly negative reviews despite the fact that he clearly has a stronger understanding of horror than most of the PG-13 hack-jobs that fill out the genre these days. THWOES is perfect for his hyperactive imagination to take full advantage of world of cartoons.

Superbeasto himself is a actor-slash-director dressed as a Mexican wrestler. His sister Susie X is some kind of secret agent hunting zombie Nazis. They're supposed to work together but Superbeasto's womanizing and laziness often prevents him from taking part. His old high school punching bag Steve Wachowski adopts the guise of Dr. Satan and plans to take over the world once he weds a girl with a 666 tattoo on her ass. That girl just happens to be a stripper Superbeasto has the hots for and he's not going to let Dr. Satan have his way.

THWOES plays a lot like a feature-length skit from MTV's Liquid Television back in the early 90s. It's often surreal and rapid-fire. If you like the maniacal humor of Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law and can keep up with the madness then you'll get a kick out of El Superbeasto. There's lots of blood and gore and nudity too if that's your kinda of thing.

Keep a lookout for Captain Spaulding and Otis Driftwood too, and stick around for the end of the closing credits.",1266624000,,1408,4.601593625498008

I'm a big fan of animation in general, and bizarre, nonsensical cartoons in particular, but this film just didn't do anything for me. Within the first five minutes I had lost all interest in watching any further; I forced myself to watch all the way to end anyway, anticipating something that would draw me into the story, but alas, it never came.

There were gratuitous amounts of violence & toon nudity, but it came from out of nowhere and didn't go anywhere. I didn't walk into this expecting Shakespeare or anything, but despite the appeal of wild themes like zombie Nazis & monster strip clubs, from start to finish the whole thing just felt stupid & pointless. A couple of jokes landed nicely, but 9 out of 10 were just plain lame (despite being punctuated with unnecessary boobs or decapitations).

Ultimately, I rented this movie for a dollar and still felt pretty ripped off.

On a final note, I have no idea where people are getting the idea that the animation was epic - I was pleasantly reminded of Ren & Stimpy cartoons, but it sure wasn't anything special.",1265414400,6,1143,4.620689655172414
3906050,1,B002CGT0TW,"I really looked forward to this. It was the first blu ray I ever owned. I had read the reviews and was looking forward to adding a cult classic in the making to my brand new blu ray collection.

The animation was limited, but decent enough to tell the jokes. the animators were very funny.

It was pretty weak from start to finish. It felt like every joke had been confiscated from some other better cartoon. I feel like it stole from Southpark, family guy, Venture Brothers, Futurama, Invader Zim, Looney Tunes, and Ren and Stimpy. But mostly Ren and Stimpy. For example, there were so many zoom in shots where the simple line drawing became a detailed rendering of something disgusting. Very Kricfalusi.  There was even the fog horn sound effect in these shots. What also felt like john kricfalusi was the female sex kittens in the show, but they weren't drawn as well. I kept waiting to see some special thanks to John K. maybe I missed it. I was anxious to remove it from my player.

Imagine if Rob Zombie got high with Quintin Tarantino in the editing room of Inglorious Basterds, went home watched Ren and Stimpy the Lost Episodes snorted 15 lines of ""It's okay to tweak the joke if it's homage"" then wrote this in 2 binge drunk days.

Add a Devil voiced with ham-chewing glee by Paul Giamatti, and you have all the ingredients for this hot mess of a project.

While ""El Superbeasto"" has some genuinely hysterical moments (mostly given to the Dr Satan and giant ape Otto characters), the bulk of the DVD is made of sex/fart/bodypart jokes. There's the usual now-obligatory million pop culture references and inside jokes (watch for almost every actor in a Rob Zombie movie to have an animated counterpart somewhere), but that doesn't a good script make. The characters spit out lines with a Tanantino speed-machine rapidity (with Tom Papa fairing best as Superbeasto simply because he is over-hamming on purpose) but there's no track to take them on.

I made excuses for Halloween since it really wasn't his story. But now he's come out with something uniquely his and it's just a tad disappointing. Maybe I'm just expecting too much, but Superbeasto just leaves me flat. It plays out like a Ren and Stimpy episode in overdrive. At first blush that might not sound like a bad thing, except that R&S was awesome when it first came out almost 20 years ago - and to still ape that style and vibe is just a little tired. Sadly, I'm starting to think RZ just doesn't have the film-making chops to make the movies he sees in his head - kinda like giving a five year old sheet music for Mozart and expecting a symphony.

It seems to try to be like so many things and it's just a lot to process - it's like a Tarintino flick, but animated with stolen scenes from a million little unknown cult faves from yore.  I liked it, glad I saw it.  But it's not something I need to see again or even have in my collection.  I appreciate what Zombie tries to do and wants to do, but he just never seems to pull it off and I am not really sure why.  My major problem with the movie is Rosario Dawson's character's dialogue - the excessive Urban style yammering is not cute, funny, it's just plain annoying.  This movie has everything I like in movies, packed full of all the genre greats - boobs, nazi's, werewolves, aliens, monster, devils, the list goes on, but it's just lifeless.",1256860800,2,952,4.314606741573034
3906066,2,B002CGT0TW,"Rob Zombie is not much of a director. For anybody who grew up watching Grindhouse oddities and are well-versed in the Horror and Cult subgenres, it becomes painfully obvious that the director oft-times borrows more than create believable, loving homages. His films often feel like tired retreads rather than genuinely creative or quirky output. It's unfortunate that his first animated feature should meet the same fate.

""El Superbeasto"" is based off of a ridiculous Comic Book series that Zombie had marketed some years ago and it follows the exploits of a ""super-hero"" who is clearly inspired by masked Spanish wrestlers of the 60s like Santo the Demon. He is supposedly a pretty cool cat who can just snap his fingers and get babes to appear in his privately made adult films. He also fights crime occasionaly, but often times leaves that to his Cousin, a babe with an eyepatch who is voiced by Rob Zombie's wife, who likes to undress many times throughout the cartoon and hang out with the robot from THE PHANTOM CREEPS(1939).
Superbeasto frequents a Monster strip club one night and his eyes falls upon gorgeous goth babe, Velvet Von Black. She's adorable looking, but is a real potty mouth, as voiced by Rossario Dawson. She attracts the attention of villain, Dr. Satan, who plans on marryinf her and taking over the world.

The cartoon is beautifully animated, resembling a classic Looney Tunes, more often than not. Except this cartoon is exceptionally violent and is loaded with profanity and nudity. At first, the adolescent sense of humor is actually rather infectious, as the soundtrack is complete with dirty little ditties that describe the onscreen action. After awhile, this schtick just tires itself out and becomes rather monotonous and repetitive.

Many homages are made throughout to classic film, but I have the feeling that'd they fall on deaf ears. For some reason the film begins with the same(except in animated form) beginning as FRANKENSTEIN(1931), though I doubt that fans of that film would appreciate the childish humor within. Why not make the whole film a classic Horror parody? This just seems wildly out of place and inappropiate, another example of Zombie's excesses as a filmmaker.

Undoubtably, teenage boys will love this film for it's racy context and bucketloads of cartoon boobage, but it just dosen't go anywhere. The problem may be that the film feels half-finished. Even in something as ridiculous as this, we need a reason to LIKE these characters and unfortunately we don't. Paul Giamatti steals the show as Doctor Satan, but even the veteran thespian can hardly overcome the sheer boredom and inepitude. All Zombie films feature many good character actors, whose sheer personality often carry the films. As a developer of character, he seems to always fall short.

The DVD presentation is decent, with LOTS of bonus footage and alternate scenes that will appeal to those interested. For fans of over-the-top cartoon gore and sexy cartoon babes cat-fighting, clearly this deserves a viewing. Everyone else should probally just put on an old White Zombie record and watch HEAVY METAL(1981) again.",1256515200,7,3142,5.0813953488372094

3906068,5,B002CGT0TW,"I bought this movie, like I buy most of my movies, on a whim. I thought this was great though. The theme songs for the characters in the movie are hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing from the music. The movie itself is a little bit lacking in the plot point. But if you don't mind seeing cartoon nudity, sex and violence then this may be the movie for you.",1255824000,,356,4.173913043478261
3906069,2,B002CGT0TW,"When Rob Zombie isn't making terrible music or ruining classic horror movies, he's making awful, uncreative animated cartoons. If this cartoon wasn't attached to Zombies name, there's no way it would get any attention. This is just bad. Sex jokes just for the sake of sex jokes isn't funny. Especially not every 3 minutes. You said tits, wow. Very edgy. And putting your wife in your movies is just about as obnoxious as it gets. The trailer for this looked cool, but I was definitely tricked. There is nothing cool about El Beasto himself. He's an odd, one dimensional character with no redeeming qualities. He's a horndog, and violent - we get it. But what else is there? You have to add more to the characters. All of them pretty much sucked. The gorilla was sort of cool, and I thought Dr. Satan would be interesting, but he really wasn't. Most of the characters in fact, blended together to the point where you could barely tell them apart. This was a very unoriginal  and uncreative endeavor. Much like the rest of Rob's career. I'm waiting for him, and many other overrated directors and writers to step aside, to allow the thousands of people with actual talent to get their stuff out there. This really could of been written by a pervy hyper active 12 year old and came out exactly the same.

So let's review:

1. Not cool
2. Not creative
3. Not funny
4. Not interesting

Yet, because it's Rob Zombie,and he's SO edgy and cool, people love this movie. Awesome.",1255824000,7,1469,4.595419847328245

And tho I was initially thinkin the tit 'n' ass style would get old (i.e. sexist) the most kick-ass characters are the fems. i mean, a nazi-zombie hunting super-hero chick who rides her robot side-kick [...]... and there's really always something to giggle about. I'm hoping they put out a XXX version on DVD. I just found some kool t-shirts with Superbeasto designs at the online tv/movie store Gold Label Goods.",1255478400,,494,4.625

If you have ever doubted her acting skills check it out. It takes talent to do voice acting. This film has it all and It goes for the most dirty joke at all times. Its animation is very ren and stimpy style comedy. Its a new style we have not seen Rob do yet and I think it turned out great. I love the scene where beasto hits Myers with a car. Its a classic in its very own right and remember the Japanese do it every day,Now jerk one out for the usa!",1255478400,,574,3.7916666666666665

3906074,5,B002CGT0TW,"In a world of horror movie icons and monsters alike, there seems to be a crime-fighting badass hero by the of El Superbeasto (Voiced by Tom Papa) who is sometimes called Beasto as he fights the forces of evil even with the help of his uber-babe sister Suzi X (Voiced by Sheri Moon Zombie). He's a very rich and successful man of action as he's a hero, an icon and a lover of many fine gorgeous women whom either are human or monster, our hero falls for gorgeous stripper Velvet Von Black (Voiced by Rosario Dawson) as she gets kidnapped by the villainous Dr. Satan (Voiced by Paul Giamatti) and his smart talking ape (Voiced by Tom Kenny). It's up to our hero and his sister to fight their way through various zombie soldiers, werewolves, goblins, monsters and even some horror icons to stop an unholy wedding from ever happening or the end of the world will happen.

Inspired by Rob Zombie's graphic novel ""The Haunted World of El Superbeasto"", this is an animated feature co-written and directed by none other then legendary rock star Rob Zombie. The film does co-star the voices of Ken Foree, Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, Geoffrey Lewis, Dee Wallace Stone, Rob Paulson, Roger Bumpass, Danny Trejo and Charles Adler all together, the movie is well animated and is a very funny satire of horror movies, 70's action exploitatation flicks and cartoons in general much like the comic book was. There's plenty of nudity, graphic animated violence with gore, and a black sense of humor in the Ren and Stimpy/Drawn Together/South Park tradition as this is one cartoon that is definitely not for children.

This Blu-Ray offers an incredible eye-popping transfer with high quality sound with a few decent extras like deleted scenes & Shots, BD-exclusive full length animatics and alternate scenes.",1254441600,,1785,4.830065359477124
3906075,5,B002CGT0TW,"I heard about this movie when Rob Zombie started on it about 4 years ago, I think. I have been waiting a long time to see this and when I finally got to sit down and watch it I was blown away. It is not for the easily offended but it is a Rob Zombie movie, you have to know going into it that it will be beyond all borders of reality. The story is simple but entertaining, and the animation is great. The characters are well developed for the short time this movie is on and there is always something to either keep you laughing hysterically or enjoying the action. It has the standard cast of favorites that you would see in any of his movies, his wife being one of the main characters. However, it was nice to see a big name like Paul Giamati taking on the roll of Dr Satan. For anyone who is a fan of Rob Zombie this is worth the viewing. There is a cartoon warning as to the content of the movie so sit back and enjoy this cartoon for adults and get ready to laugh.",1254268800,,969,4.0
