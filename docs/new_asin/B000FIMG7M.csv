2568423,3,B000FIMG7M,"With conductor Valery Geriev and the Kirov opera one gets a fine production of what, to me,is a ""bland"" 174 minute opera that could be reduced by one third with no loss! In the commentary one critic maintains that Rimsky-Korsakov's operas suffer from what may be a ""crippling disability""- a lack of characterization and dramatic power. Sadko has lovely background music to read a book by! It also seems ""padded"". In one scene for example, Sadko is about to set out on his great voyage but before he leaves he asks merchants from three different countries to describe their homelands. This has nothing to do with the plot!",1159920000,14,621,4.7592592592592595
2568424,5,B000FIMG7M,"The late Mehli Mehta once called SADKO the most beautiful opera ever sritten. He was posssible correct as the opera is a hymn to the sea, love,  adventure and romance. It is saturated with the most gorgeous music. The immortal Song of India is just the crowning jewel in this rich tapestry.

Just as outstanding is the look of this work. You are magically transported from the ancient city of Novgorod to an enchanted lake to the underseas kingdon of the sea king and back agan to Novgorod. It must be the most gorgeous opera to look at now available on DVD. Forget television, the latest news and the cares of today for three hours and enjoy this fantasy.

Hint: If you enjoy this work check out the DVD of Alexander Ptushko's non-operatic SADKO and see what the Russian master of fantasy did with this story. Much of Rimsky-Korsakov's music was utilized and it is just about as stunning.",1158537600,76,889,4.578616352201258
2568445,5,B000FIMG7M,"This is a sumptuously staged live performance by the Kirov company from St Petersburg in 1994. It is basically Sadko as I like it, but I sense that I had better be careful in how I recommend it. I speak (and sing) no Russian, and I have never visited Russia. However I am accustomed to hearing Russian sung, and the effect of the singing here has a rather smoothed-over sense. Even the lavish and brilliant costumes and staging, although assertively Russian, have a certain suggestion of western professionalism about them, and I do not know what I should put this impression down to. Everything changes over time, and it may simply be that this is the new Russian way of doing things, particularly in the most westward-looking of Russian cities.

On the other hand Rimsky is looking outwards for his inspiration. He regales us with a concert from a Viking, an Indian trader and a merchant of Venice, none of whom are exactly essential to the plot. The plot takes as its starting-point a legend of Novgorod and a real person called Sadko, but it is a fairy-tale, not just multi-ethnic but taking place largely in the non-human kingdom under the great international sea. Under the circumstances I'm not inclined to labour the issue of Russianness. Nor am I much worried by the question how this libretto relates to contemporary ideas of opera as practised by Wagner or Verdi. Rimsky tells us explicitly that he is turning his back on any theory of opera that gives primacy to dramatic action or development. For him, it is all about making music. For me, Sadko is an upmarket pantomime, a musical pageant on stage. If I may risk the expression, Rimsky makes a song and dance of it all. The choruses at the start are longer than would be needed from a dramatic point of view, and that is because the composer is more concerned with writing choruses. The deus ex machina called The Pilgrim who ends the revels of the sea-king and his court does so in a lengthy aria because the composer wishes to write a lengthy aria. The overseas visitors put on a concert of stylised solos in the interests of musical variety, not of the overall story. The whole thing stands in much the same relation to music-drama as ballet does, and there is a great deal of Terpsichore and light fantastic on top of the musical entertainment that is really what it is all about. Rimsky himself tells us what to expect, Sadko seems to me to have perfect integrity on its own terms, and this performance seems to me to get it about right.

The cast are unfamiliar to me, but with one partial exception I like their work. Vladimir Galusin as Sadko is easy on the ear (and not a bad actor), and he does not attempt a heroic style. Nor does Gergiev more generally. This is a relaxed performance, and at a musical entertainment I expect to be invited to relax. If it does not seem ungallant to say so, the only problem I have with the singing concerns Valentina Tsidipova as Sadko's temporary undersea wife, the sea-princess Volkhova. In vocal quality she does not compare well with his `real' human wife Marianna Tarassova, but she largely makes up for that with the touching and affecting account she gives of her final lullaby-farewell to Sadko. Otherwise the cast in general, chorus as well as principals, suit me just fine. Character-delineation is not the name of the game and they do not have to be assessed on that score. The voices are right for their respective roles, and they convey the sense of enjoyment that I look for in this opera.

My rarely-used DVD player is hooked up to my television at the moment, and the speakers, though perfectly adequate, are not to the standard of those on my Sony hi-fi set. Nevertheless I caught the effect of Rimsky's exquisite orchestral writing, described by Tovey as the purest since Mozart himself, quite well. The swans make their entrance to generalised sea-bird calls, which I don't think is a noise swans make, but it is so artistic and beautiful that I'm not bothered by that, and even on my B-speakers the effect is delightful. The production is quite a feast for the eye. The costumes are magnificent, and I must say the cast in general are extremely good-looking. Sadko is shorter in stature than his undersea wife, but standing 5'6"" myself I can forgive that. The first entrance of the sea-king is a perfect pantomime effect, and the final apotheosis of poor Volkhova is very adeptly achieved. The choreography is jaw-droppingly brilliant at times. I suppose the high spot of that should be the increasingly frenzied dance of the undersea courtiers, but I have to admit that the co-ordinated arm-movements of the bevy of Indian lovelies had me whooping with delight and this short episode is likely to ensure more frequent use of my DVD equipment in future.

At the end the entire huge cast, plus the conductor, take a collective and richly deserved envoi. There had just been 3 hours of `Sadko', but for one spectator at least it had been over in no time. To go with the disc there is a good liner-note from the distinguished critic Robert Layton, providing the quotes from the composer that should assist in our understanding of what he is about here. The full libretto is not supplied, but Layton also provides a summary of the action that is all that I for one was after. Read it once and you will have everything you need before sitting back and enjoying the sound and the spectacle.",1203033600,8,5414,4.648225469728601
2568446,4,B000FIMG7M,"Unknown to me, prior to seeing this DVD, I was overwhelmed by the all around quality of the production.  Magnificent singing, stunning scenery and costumes beyone comparison.  The leading voices were confident and right on key.  And the chorus was pure glory.  Only reason I didn't rate this five stars was my own lack of knowledge of other productions, live or recorded.  Discovering Russian opera is a grand vocation following the downfall of the Berlin wall.",1185580800,5,461,5.0131578947368425
2568447,4,B000FIMG7M,"The staging is a little hammy, but the music is the thing and this is a very good performance. Recommended.",1180828800,3,107,4.4
2568448,5,B000FIMG7M,"Let go of Puccini, Wagner and the rest.  Russian opera is its own universe of sound.  The voices, the instrumentation, the melodies all are unique to this vast musical culture which is finally starting to make an impact in the West.

We can thank Mr. Gergiev in many ways for opening this doorway for us.  He is a tireless advocate and missionary of Russian opera.  Is he a great conductor?  That's another matter.  But what he does unquestionably accomplish is the task of familiarizing us with the numerous operatic treasures that Russia has produced.  Some of his efforts achieve greatness, like his Tsar's Bride, Pique Dame and Iolanta.

Here he gives us Rimsky's Sadko, arguably one of the most beautiful works in the Russian repertoire.  This production is gorgeous, as is the music.  The singers and the conducting, though, are disappointing if you are familiar with the authentic Russian tradition of music-making.  The Russian language has a unique palatalization of vowels, which gives it that beautiful quality so immediately perceptible when we hear Russian spoken.

That underlying vocal quality inherent in Russian may be partly responsible for the Slavic sound that makes historic Russian singers so instantly recognizable, as well as their individuality of sound.  When we hear a famous Russian singer from the past, we know we are hearing a personality - typically a huge voice with a real face, as it's said.  Today, unfortunately, the little, pretty generic voices that abound everywhere are deprived of the power, nobility and polish that we hear in great Russian singers of the past.

And here we have one of the big problems with Gergiev's Sadko.  There's no Sadko!  The tenor singing this heroic part is pathetically inept. There are some notable voices in this production.  Valentina Tsidipova has a beautiful, shimmering but not quite big enough sound for the Sea Princess.  She's also an exotically lovely woman, so it's surprising, given her lush vocal sound, that she's not seen anywhere else in the musical marketplace.  Some of the other singers have that certain Slavic something that makes you sit up and take notice.  But without a Sadko, you don't quite get the proper introduction to the greatness of Rimsky's work.

The other problem is Gergiev's - at times - boringly feeble conducting.  He is sorely lacking in the propulsive, rhythmic power that drove the great Russian opera conductors like Golovanov, Melik-Pashayev, Khaikin, Kondrashin, Svetlanov and Ermler.  These conductors existed in a nonstop lineage of dramatic and musical splendor that dissolved when the last of them, Mark Ermler, passed on a few years ago.  They had a driven, theatrical, and I  must add - virile - method of conducting that breathed life and vigor into the orchestra.  This powerful method of conducting has disappeared from the scene.  At times Gergiev's conducting seems so drained of any rhythmic pulse whatsoever, that the poor singers have to anxiously try to maintain some kind of beat themselves in the void of Gergiev's slack and nerveless musical environment.

Whether it's the injection of internationalism or westernization flooding the former Soviet Union, resulting in the dilution of the unique Russian sound and a consequential cultural attenuation, or a lack of adequate talent which is at the root of this problem remains to be seen.  But if you can get past the - at times - completely inert conducting and the inadequate singing of some of the principles, including the chorus, this DVD will initiate you into an unforgettable sound world of sensuous and magical music.  This Sadko has enough moments of greatness in it to draw the uninitiated into further exploration of the rich and wondrous arsenal of Russian operas.

The greatest recording of Sadko was made in 1949 by the conductor Nikolai Golovanov with the ringing powerhouse of Georgi Nelepp's magnificent and erotic tenor voice.  His heart-melting duet with the Sea Princess in Scene II is only one of the many moments of spectacular music-making on this exalted recording.  Nelepp's unforgettable performance, at times heroic, at times seductive, is available on several labels&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rimski-Korsakov-Sadko/dp/B0007DDPP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rimski-Korsakov: Sadko</a>&nbsp;but only Gergiev's CD recording, which may be identical to this DVD's soundtrack, will give  you a libretto.

One of the many joys of this opera occurs in Scene IV, when we are given three show-stopping tunes, historically performed by the Bolshoi's greatest singers.  In the Golovanov Sadko we have Ivan Kozlovsky singing the famous Song of India.  The other two gems come from the extraordinary Armenian baritone Pavel Lisitsian, and that godlike favorite of Stalin's, bass Mark Reizen.  In the uneaven Mr. Gergiev's Sadko, only the Viking gives us something reminiscent of the Bolshoi's former vocal splendor.

There is another unreleased video of Sadko live from the Bolshoi with Vladimir Atlantov and his wife Tamara Milashkina as the Sea Princess.  It's a pretty tacky production, and very noisy, from a lot of stomping around and the shrill voices of these two.  However, it has the sumptuous mezzo of Irina Arkhipova, a very great exemplar of the Russian singing tradition.  It may be released one day if people continue to express interest in Russian operatic achievements.

Watch this video then get Golovanov's dynamic, theatrical performance and listen to it while you watch the video with the sound off.  Then you'll have an idea of the immense sensual and spiritual beauty of Rimsky's operatic masterpiece.

Highly recommended, in spite of its limitations, for introducing the world to this gorgeous work.",1175385600,40,5767,5.293729372937293
2568449,4,B000FIMG7M,"A beautiful Russian opera sang by Russian singers, conducted by a great Russian conductor and staged for Russian audiances. If you like Russian opera you should own this DVD.

2568450,5,B000FIMG7M,"While opera critics have panned ""Sadko"" as lacking dramatic thrills, it's a bylina and not an Italian circus. If you're looking for battles, dramatic suicides, torrid love scenes, etc., don't watch ""Sadko."" However, if you want to see and hear a wonderful performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's Russian magic, by all means enjoy this DVD. While ""Sadko's"" music doesn't have quite the magical effects as Rimsky's ""Christmas Eve"" or the comedy of ""Tsar Saltan,"" it combines nationalist folksy revelry, a touching love duet between Sadko and the Swan Princess, and some colorful exotic tunes (the famous ""Song of India"" comes from this opera). Even my 6-year old daughter enjoyed the buffonery in the first act's banquet scene.

Gergiev leads the Kirov orchestra brilliantly, and the recording engineers reproduce the performance well. I enjoyed the costumes and sets as fitting for the Russian flavor of the work (unlike the bizarre postmodern ""skid row"" look of the Kirov's performance of Boris Godunov in Orange County in October 2006). The colors appear vividly and images sharply on my HD TV, and this is a welcome relief from older recordings I watch.",1168473600,17,1148,5.172043010752688
2568451,5,B000FIMG7M,"This fairy tale has many features in common with many creation myths.  Water plays a big part in this tale, as it does in the Ring.

  The music is of the highest order.  The cast of singers is huge.  This Russian cast can really sing.  Russian basses are in a class of their own.  The sound of the opera chorus is breathtaking.  The playing of this huge orchestra gives the whole production a solid foundation, creating a big and dramatic sound scape.

  Then we come to the sets and staging. The sets are simply magnificent and opulent, to say the least.  All this captured superbly  by the cameras.

  This whole production adds up to a delicious saturation of the senses.  To recreate this production in the home requires a superior system, especially in the audio department.  To enjoy this production a system with a smooth wide range frequency response is mandatory.  The system also needs power to spare.  There a huge sounds presented to the system here.  I can't see much enjoyment to be obtained with small or TV speakers.

  The balance of the recording is too close for comfort.  A more distant ambient balance would have been an improvement.

  If you have the system, there is a lot to delight here.",1167696000,12,1214,4.59433962264151
2568452,5,B000FIMG7M,"One reviewer called this a bore and failure due to lack of drama and story.  It's not meant to have character development and a steady plot.  It is episodes from a well known fairy tale, illustrations if you will.  Many viewers would already know this very famous Russian fairy tale (especially when it was originally written) so it is not necessary to tell the story again; anyway fairy tales are not required to have 'character developement'.  So if you need character and plot development, go for Boris Godunov etc.  If you want lovely music, beautiful staging and a great ensemble this is highly recommended.",1164844800,11,612,4.846153846153846

five stars. But I thought maybe I should warn others how disappointing this performance
is. The opera itself is marvelous: it's the production and the singers that fall short.
I've just been watching another Kirov production under Gergiev--of Rossini's Il Viaggio
a Reims--and so far it's literally the best opera video I've ever seen, brilliant and
imaginative and filled with wonderful Russian singer-actor-comics. Yet this Sadko is
simply dull. Its hero goes through the entire piece with a vacant smile. The dancing is
on the ballet-class level. No, worse. And the three cameos in the harbor scene, for which the
Bolshoi used to bring on its top stars, are dreary. I grew up on an old Soviet recording
of this work, and these three ""guests"" (as they're called) were the black bass Mark Reizen,
the sumptuous baritone Pavyel Lisitsian, and the insanely mesmerizing tenor Ivan
Kozlofsky. Not only that: near the opera's end, when Sadko and the Sea Princess are
so to say riding back on the waves, the conductor, Golovanof, whipped the orchestra into
a frenzy. On this DVD, Gergiev is just beating time. But don't believe anyone who says that
Sadko itself is underpowered: this performance is so empty that it's misleading viewers.
If you want to hear what Sadko's really like, try to find the Golovanof recording on CD.
