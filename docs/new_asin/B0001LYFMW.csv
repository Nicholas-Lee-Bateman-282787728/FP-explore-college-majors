The script, the production, the actors, the direction, the whole thing, has me signing on to buy the DVD as this is a movie I will want to watch over and over again. Really is the best movie I've seen in a long time....",1179532800,2,363,4.041666666666667
8014246,5,B0001LYFMW,"We all face moments in life when we have to break away from the confines of our community, the expectations of our peers, and the strings of our family. Wooden Watermelons addresses these challenges in a thoughtful and beautiful way. Wendy English shines both as the director and star of this film, a colorful drama with a brisk plot and memorably developed characters.",1085875200,13,369,4.873015873015873
8014247,5,B0001LYFMW,"I had the rare opportunity to watch this movie before it went out on DVD. Am very happy for the folks who made it that it is one of the few independent films to pick up a distribution contract (only about one out of every 18 make it). It won important awards at film festivals across the world. Lots of folks will recognize themselves in this quirky, heartfelt film. I love the music as well, especially two songs by Janice and Jayne White, ""Amazing Love"" and ""It's About Me,"" which appear at a turning point and at the ending credits.",1085529600,15,535,4.36
