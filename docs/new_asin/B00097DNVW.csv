2269355,5,B00097DNVW,"Private Dancer is an intermediate to advanced program that follows basics in Lady Morrigan's previous programs in exotic dance. The dance movement is luscious, sensual, and a beautiful and feminine art form.
 The "" serious about perfection student""  in exotic dance can certainly use this program to build on. That is obvious from the very extensive, fabulous 50 minute workout /conditioning for strength and flexibility section!  This section begins with standing deep leg stretching,(using a chair for support), squats layered on plie and releve,floor exercises follow with advanced leg stretches, abdominal crunches and more advanced yoga poses such as downward facing dog, advanced pigeon poses, frog poses. Once you get past all that, there's more- a generous helping of side leg lifts at 90 degree angles for glut firming. Take that as a gift to yourself for a better butt. Great workout!

Once you have conditioned your body, it's time to dance. The dance tutorials are again generous with luscious, combinations and layering movement with complementing arm patterns.  Each section defines the movement with its corresponding name. Voice or music only options,and dance practice sections are included.

Tutorials:
  chair dance, easy enough to do, posing, strutting and figure of 8's.

 For the floor section, I can see how strengthening the back and the legs first are very important in the preparation section as the movement here is very physically demanding. Leg shimmies, and fan kicks were fun to do.

 I did not attempt the couch dance but it was entertaining; catty and wild!

This program is immensely enjoyable, challenging, and a great gift for its recipient.  For me, the workout is my absolute favorite section as I can apply it to my practical lifestyle. Because of such intricate body movement I would advice those hoping for more precise breakdown and practice runs to begin with Lady M's previous programs.",1306540800,37,1930,5.203883495145631
2269356,4,B00097DNVW,"The other reviewr did a good job explaining the contents of the dvd, so I will just state what I thought of it. This was a very fun dvd and one overall that I am happy to have purchased. I thought the music was appropriate and that a generous amount of information was given. The setting was a little boring.  The main problem with the dvd that I have is that,the instruction is lacking and she moves through the movements too fast. There is not a clear breakdown on the dvd. I would have prefered her to be in a room with mirrors and showing from all angles while she is demonstrating the move and explaining how to execute the movement properly.  I know some of the moves are supposed to be advanced to intermediate though so maybe thats why the breakdown isn't precise. Even the practice session or rather the detailed tutorial is not that detailed. With that said again I enjoyed this dvd immensely. And even though the breakdown could have been better this is not one of those dvd's where you won't be able to get the movments, but it will take practice. This dvd delivers exactly what it promises.

2269357,5,B00097DNVW,"I received a review copy of this dvd.  From the back cover, Exotic Dance Private Dancer offers a step-by-step breakdown with practice sessions that will help you master a variety of authentic exotic dance steps, transitions and combinations.

The menu is the following:
Welcome, Strength and Flexibility
Exotic Dance Practice tutorial
Dance Practice: voice prompts, music only
Challenging Floor work tutorial
Floor Work: voice prompts, music only
Couch dance tutorial and demos

Strength and Flexibility:  This is a 50 minute dance warm-up that starts standing.  You will need a sturdy chair.  Mine wasn't and I almost fell over while doing leg stretches (very unsexy).  And enough floor space to open your legs into a wide angle while lying down. It begins with tendues, plies, leg stretches while holding on to a chair. It then proceeds to the floor with sit ups, push ups, interesting hip openers, downward dog on toes and downward dog flip outs. Lady M is dressed in a red teddy.  I felt under dressed in my tank top and tights with a sleep bonnet on my head.  The music is hard to describe, but maybe the words slinky, rhythmic and sultry come to mind.  The movement isn't always in time with the music and sometimes she doesn't count so you will need to keep up on your own.  Even if exotic dance is not your thing, this is a good workout on its own.

Dance Practice and Tutorial:

I didn't do this practice, but I watched it.  Here is the menu:
Strut
Teaser 1.5
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana with chair
thumper
Saltshaker
rump shaker
360 with bell step
Leg shimmies with chair

What can I say.  Most of the moves are standing, walking, turning and moving your hips and rump.

Challenging floor work menu:
Downs & ups
thumper on the floor variation
Salt shaker on the floor
Waves
Chest circles and hair whips
Venus half arch
Waves and circles
Mermaid
Booty walk
Leg Shimmies on the floor
Fan kicks
TLC
Good morning and good morning challenge
Split drop/Hollywood variation
secretary
ground inverts and variations
shoulder inverts with eye opener

This looks to be a very challenging workout.  It requires stamina and flexibility and an uninhibited spirit.

Couch Dance:  This is how to do a lap dance.  She first uses a teddy bear.  Yes you read it right, a teddy bear as a prop.  She gyrates, sits, twirls and much more on this teddy bear.  Then the prop is replaced by a man who looks quite pleased to be her live demonstration.

All in all Lady M is very good at what she does.  If you desire to learn exotic dance, then this is your dvd. You can give your partner a lap dance and who knows with the economy the way it is, you may discover a 2nd career.  As for me, I've been married for 22 years and...whatever.",1305158400,14,2715,4.576763485477178

2269371,5,B00097DNVW,"YES! Lady Morrighan is terrific. Others have described the DVD, so I just want to add my kudos for a well put together and fun program to teach great dance moves for lovers. it's called Intermediate because some of her shimmies are tough, but her style and exuberance transfer well to any dancer's ability. Her workout is the best one I've seen so far. I usually put several DVD's in for my morning workout, but Lady M's workout provides a lot of toning exercise as well as her sexy dance presentation. It's obvious she has had a lot of formal bellydance training. If I only had one dance DVD, this would be the one for me.",1414281600,5,623,4.379310344827586

2269376,4,B00097DNVW,"First off, this is not an exercise video, so if your looking for that you should look elsewhere. That said, I found this video very informative. Lady Morrighan knows how to exotic dance very well and takes the time to go through the movement slowly so you can understand.",1396828800,4,271,4.551020408163265

But even so, she is very good at explaining how to do certain moves and the camera angles are great so you can see the way it will look from different view points. My only gripe is that sometimes she goes through a move too quickly. I have to use the ""repeat chapter"" feature on my DVD player so that I can practice the move until it looks right. But overall a good buy and I feel like he will be impressed.",1361232000,2,581,4.017241379310345

2269386,5,B00097DNVW,"I purchased all three of Lady M's exotic dance series, and I have loved every minute of working with them. Out of the three, Private Dancer has been my favorite. The way they formatted the material on this one, is a little different from the first two and I liked it better - plus the moves are really hot, loved the costuming, and great music they used. I will say alot of the moves on this one are more challenging than the first two DVDs. It takes more strength & agility to do the majority of the moves. To help with that, she included a nice section on body strengthening & condtioning. This DVD also has alot of new moves that she shows how to perform from a slow- to a quicker pace. And I got into the music a little more -it varies between funky hip-hop to lounge electronic instrumentals, with beats that make you want to move.

The sections are set up like this:
Strength & Flexiblity-(body condtioning excercises)
Exotic Dance Tutorial (breaks down the movements & transitions)
Practice-(the moves from the tutorial performed all together, as a dance)

What's great about the practice sections, there are two versions to choose from: one with voice-over cues (she tells you which move is coming next as you dance) or just music only (just the dance). You just follow along.

Floorwork Tutorial (Floor moves)
Practice-with cues or music only

Couch Dance (moves taught for a lap dance on a couch using a teddy bear)
Couch Dance Demonstration (an example of what it will look like & tips on what to do when you have a live person instead of the teddy bear)

I really liked this DVD and would recommend it. The moves taught are more intermediate, so if you are new to this style of dancing or not in great shape, try either Lady M's Exotic Dance-Irresistable Art or Exotic Dance- Workout. Both are beginner level.",1334188800,4,1821,4.556574923547401
2269387,1,B00097DNVW,"I've never stripped or danced for my guy...and so I thought maybe getting this DVD would give me some insight into getting a nice sensual sexy routine I can practice on and surprise him with.  WELL....basically this video just tells you these basic moves:
rump shaker ---which is basically shaking your butt up and down  (they make the ""exotic"" dance look sleazy...shaking your butt real fast?  no need for an hour video)
salt shaker -- which is now moving your butt left to right
rotating your hips left to right (she calls this the hollywood), up and down (she calls this the the wave)
and....thats it!!  She then shows you by dancing on a big teddy bear that is sitting on the sofa and incorporates a chair which she uses to hold herself while her legs and butt are 'rump shaking' to the teddy bear on the couch.  (A real male is used for the ending WITH THE SAME MOVES I just stated.
Was not WOWED whatsoever.  I seriously believe I can learn more from going to a strip club and paying for a lap dance then this. ***Do not waste your money on this.***  I just threw the DVD in the garbage.  I hope I save you some $$ by reading this review and investing your cash in perhaps a better reviewed dance DVD from Amazon then this; and normally I do not write reviews.",1324598400,30,1266,4.334745762711864
2269388,4,B00097DNVW,"I've purchased several exotic and erotic dance instructional DVDs and books throughout the years, from S Factor to Carmen Electra - and literally almost everything in between. I can safely say each product has its own niche in a sense, but none of them truly had what I was looking for: tutorials on how to do those sexy, undulating moves I've seen done by exotic dancers like those in the music videos - and even some adult DVDs.

I know there are a lot of women who prefer other styles and instructionals because they don't feel it's their place or requirement to learn all there is to know about erotic dance, and that's fine, but I like this DVD because it's about 2 hours of really useful information and lessons to apply to your own routine.

The warmup is about 50 minutes long and it's composed of stretches dancers of all genres use to become limber and flexible before they dance. The entire tutorial is broken down into several parts, that can be played separately or together.

Overall, the product is classy and well put together. What I loved most is how Lady M introduces transitional moves into your practice. This is important if you're really interested in being able to really seduce and perform for your lover without awkward ""Gosh, what do I do next?"" pauses in your dance. I think anyone will also benefit from the Waves, Shimmies, Leg Shimmies and undulations.

Lady M is extremely thorough in showing you movements using everything but a pole - something we all may want, but might not all have - or see economic feasibility to install and implement as of yet (especially if you're not a homeowner!). Whether your routine is based on the floor, in a chair, standing, giving him (or her) a lapdance - or all of the above, Lady M works to give you as many movements and transitions as possible. I have wanted to learn so many of these moves, and didn't until this video.

I'm excited and can't wait to try them on my next partner. Especially the lapdance routine.

Ooops- yea about the Lapdance: Yes, she uses this big teddy bear... it's kind of hilarious but at the same time it is an effective prop for use. I have yet to find a large enough stuffed animal to ""drop it like it's hot"" on, but I'm still working on it. ;)",1319328000,88,2243,4.498771498771498
2269389,5,B00097DNVW,"Oh no she didn't...well, yes she did! Lady Morrighan strikes again! This DVD has so many advanced mesmerizing moves that you'll feel that you can compete with true erotic dancers. Furthermore, Lady Morrighan packs a load as the DVD is just over 2 hours long - that's 2 HOURS FULL OF HOT SEXY MOVES TO LEARN! Lady Morrighan approach is tasteful and she provides great instruction. You'll learn how to take it to and from the floor, the sofa, using a chair, you name it. Erotic Dance: Private Dancer is a great video for anyone, shape, size but note that it may be a bit advanced for those who are beginning to strut-n-shimmy his or her way into steamy sexiness.
