6681341,5,B00NW6KPXQ,I love this anime reminds me of witchblade sekirei and freezing its all intense blood intense nudity and intense action awe-soome by by all means think about it... but be warned I recommend this too 18 or older... if you are 16 watch it with someone older... breasts breasts sucking none stop but for access power to summoning ultimate powerful elemental moves...,1421712000,2,363,4.870967741935484

6681343,1,B00NW6KPXQ,"I payed $80 for an anime that I was told would be dubbed. I was lied to. This Bluray is Subbed only. I personally hate reading my TV. if I wanted to read, I will grab the manga. I ended up returning this. To be clear, this is only my opinion of the Bluray itself. I didn't watch it after the first line of Japanese was uttered. If you like Subs, this is probably fine.",1421539200,7,368,3.92
6681344,1,B00NW6KPXQ,"My further opinion can be found in the other versions of this rubbish and the ANN rating and the international reception is behind me as this series is borderline racist (i am half russian), deeply homophobic, the story lacks any basic research and it glorifies pedophilia/rape. Classy classy and a 100 $ for crappy limited animation with no dub. Lol. Well sales of the second series tanked in japan so we were spared of more or of an adaptation of it's spin-off ""Vita Sexualis"" which is the same thing with less rape. Shrug. Watch Madhouse anime as Monster/Prasyte (the manag is even better) or read Berserk/Wolfsmund/Vinland Saga. Don't worry every singe one of these has (sexual) violence too but it is not used as masturbation fodder. Champion Red/Hoods are the worst so go seinen or go home and Yutaka Tanaka even proved that hentai doesn't have to be illiterate.",1420934400,,868,4.832214765100671
6681345,4,B00NW6KPXQ,"The description says its dubbed but it's not but, don't let that descourage you from buying it.",1420502400,17,95,4.647058823529412
6681346,5,B00NW6KPXQ,"This is a great series, and highly recommend it to 16 years and older.",1417305600,4,70,4.071428571428571
6681347,3,B00NW6KPXQ,I love this anime but yet again sentai film a complete set with English dubbed in when season one & two come out one\two years ago.,1417132800,2,131,4.076923076923077
6681348,4,B00NW6KPXQ,"Fan service, violence, breast sucking.  That really sums this collection up.  Qwasers are powerful individuals with the power to control an element and turn it into weapons.  The hero of this story is the qwaser of iron, a young man of Russian descent battling renegade qwasers for the church.  Plenty of action and blood, and some excellent fight scenes.
  One thing tho..... is the qwasers energy source.  Qwasers need Soma... the energy of life.  Which they get from suckling the breasts of women. That happens alot.  Also one of the female qwasers is a sadist who enjoys bondage, and practices it constantly.
  This series is not for young people.  Violence, bare breasts, suckling both consensual and forced, with a side of  lesbian sadism make this a fan service bonanza.
  The storyline is actually fairly good tho. With enough plot action and comedic moments to balance out the massive fan service.
  All in all if you like action fan service(Freezing / Sekirei) you'll probably enjoy Qwaser of Stigmata.  If it's not your cup of tea you should probably avoid this one.",1415318400,29,1077,4.888888888888889
6681349,2,B00NW6KPXQ,"I tried to watch this a number of times. I could never get past the half-way point and eventually gave up. Off to the charity shop for you. This collection features episodes 1 - 24. I could never get to the heart of the plot or feel anything for the characters. The plot is confusing, the characters are unconvincing and the english dub is poorly acted which doesn't help. I was glad to give this a miss",1455408000,,403,4.246753246753247

6681356,5,B00NW6KPXQ,Great Ecchi Anime.  This is not for children or the easily offended but if you like ecchi anime you'll love this.  This occasionally borders on hentai and is sometimes a bit disturbing right from the opening scene but also has a great plot and interesting characters.,1433289600,,267,4.782608695652174

6681360,5,B00NW6KPXQ,"I love this anime, but I feel SO angry because NOW they're selling it in this slim format, but I initially bought it for 80+ dollars, each boxed set separately!! I feel compelled to sell the ones I have for around this price, and re-buy this slim format... I feel pretty mad about spending 80+ a year ago, and finding it for 50+ now...",1428451200,,335,4.25

6681362,5,B00NW6KPXQ,"Good anime with a lot of fan service. The story is somewhat original, but it does have a kind of harem feel to it. The animation is good and so is the voice acting",1426636800,,163,3.823529411764706
6681363,5,B00NW6KPXQ,Interesting show..It's enjoyable but just a heads up it's not English dubbed like it says!,1426291200,2,90,5.066666666666666

6681366,5,B00NW6KPXQ,One of my favorite shows. Must love breasts if you buy this one.,1423094400,,64,4.0
6681367,5,B00NW6KPXQ,"This is definitely a more perverse anime for the fan service type. Tho it does not have English dubbing it does have English subtitles. I am very glad I purchased this as a full set on bluray it has both seasons plus OVA for cheaper then the 3 dvd sets. Plus bluray is better quality image.

This series is about alchemy, the ability to transmute elements like copper, iron, glass, etc... with a twisted perverted requirement. read other reviewers comments for that. The main character is a girl who wants to become stronger, and starts to fall for the other main character the qwaser of iron, boy with white hair.

A bunch of comedy, violence, same old for this type. Like heaven's lost property, Queens Blade, Sekirei, Kampher. There is a bunch of Anime with loads of fan service that's just dirty, yet comical. So if your don't like the dirty humor of some of these anime steer clear of the this one, its extremely bad compared to most of the ones I mentioned there.",1422489600,3,969,4.531428571428571
8680586,5,B00NW6KPXQ,"DEFINITELY not for kids. For hentai lovers of big chests and ecchi flavors, enjoy. This is one of my favorites!",1533168000,,111,4.6

8680589,4,B00NW6KPXQ,I'm not sure if this is really blu-ray..... maybe it is because this is an old show. some episodes looks like DVD quality.....,1510617600,,126,4.521739130434782
8680590,5,B00NW6KPXQ,Great anime and worth the price,1496275200,,31,4.333333333333333
8680591,3,B00NW6KPXQ,"I wanted to like this more than I did, but a few things about it were just a little too far off the deep end. In particular, the concept of qwasers deriving their strength from breast milk, the overall obsession displayed with regard to breasts and lactation, and overlooking the fact that for the most part women don't lactate other than when induced by pregnancy.

That said, the characters were strong and good by anime standards. Even some the characters who early on appeared to be bullies later proved to be more well-rounded characters; the story arc of two supporting characters, Katja and Hana, was a particularly amusing guilty pleasure for me. The plots and storylines were complex and well developed. I would add too that the ending of the second series suggests further adventures that at this writing have yet to see the light of day.",1486598400,,848,4.7687074829931975

8680595,3,B00NW6KPXQ,"It is NOT dubbed, subtitled only. It is NOT for younger children, lots of breasts sucking, lesbian B&D but good series any ways. Lots of humor, action and good story",1461369600,2,165,4.533333333333333
