8603557,4,B00EBEVCGW,"Best of the Musketeers series. True to the book, spiced with very good charactization, action and humor. One of my favorite movie series. Like the mood change from the lighter Part 1 to the darker Part 2. Recommend to all!",1436400000,,222,4.575

8603559,5,B00EBEVCGW,"I believe Richard Lester's films of Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers"" are far-and-away the best movie renditions of that great book. No other films capture the humor, the sweep, and the camaraderie as these two films from 1974. The casting is excellent, across the board, the costumes and sets and cinematography are gorgeous, and the film transfer on this Optimum Classics / Studio Canal blu-ray release is vivid, even better than the fine Anchor Bay DVD version.

My only caveat with Lester's vision: the fencing almost always devolves into a fight with fists, furniture, and laundry. I wish he'd stuck to the classic Fred Cavan's-style sword dueling. Still, that's a minor quibble with an otherwise splendid pair of films that manage to incorporate a realistic look at 17th-century France (with its muddy streets and filthy peasants, its casual cruelty, and its street-side dentistry!) while keeping the joy and innocence of a classic swashbuckler.

These are perhaps the last true swashbucklers put on film, throwbacks in many ways to a vanished era, and you can't ask for better copies than these lovely blu-rays.",1407801600,,1114,5.149171270718232
