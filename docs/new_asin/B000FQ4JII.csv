8447143,5,B000FQ4JII,"If you served in the U.S. Navy during the Cold War years, you know that wherever you went, there was Ivan.  Whether it was Russian trawlers or oil tankers, every corner of the globe seemed to be crawling with Soviet ships.  I am not sure it is like that nowadays -- Ronald Reagan basically outspent the Russkies into bankruptcy and  supposedly their great submarine fleet is rusting at anchor.  Anyway this DVD is pretty much a time warp.  You're going to see several films showing the U.S. Navy at the height of its power (well nearly, I think today it's even stronger in many ways) and the Soviet Navy at one of its peaks.  There's footage in here of the Russkie aircraft carrier patrolling the Mediterranean, and I remember back in those days we kept wondering how many of them they were going to launch.  We thought maybe 10 of these Kievs, and I think maybe they completed just a few, and then they weren't that great!  Enterprise could have taken one of these things out with two catapults tied behind it's back.  Anyway, this DVD features a great film about the history of the Soviet Navy, and a film of a big Russian fleet exercise.  On the U.S. side, there's a great film hosted by Glenn Ford of ""Flying Missile"" fame, showing the capabilities of the new nuclear Navy, not to mention a neat movie showing John Kennedy reviewing the fleet shortly before he was assasinated.  In short, a terrific group of films that is worth a watch...and when you're done put on a DVD of ""Red Dawn"" as a nightcap.",1149465600,3,1505,4.4963235294117645
