2518563,5,B000EGFUI2,I originally saw this film on TV and was so impressed that I had to buy it.  A very good friend of mine is an evolutionist/scientist.  This is the perfect video to answer all of those probing scientific questions that a lay person my have hard explaining.  The photgrapy is brilliant and the narrators present the video in a way that is very no-threatening.,1276646400,6,357,4.546875
2518564,5,B000EGFUI2,"I accept the truth about evolution within a species, but to say a monkey can become human or a pencil can become an airplane is hogwash.  Evolution outside of a species is wishful thinking designed, packaged and shoved down our throats to remove human responsibility and accountability to its creator.  About the movie:  Definitely two thumbs up.  This video is a must-see, especially for young adults who are still trying to understand their purpose in life. The information given is so simple to grasp that only those with dark and hardened hearts miss God's message about His grandeur.  It's a national disgrace that the average public school student will never learn the truth behind the majesty and power of his or her creator, Jesus Christ.  Human lives are cheapened because a person's dignity is removed when he/she is ""trained"" to believe that apes are the great-great grandparents of mankind.  How can anyone, when given the facts about creation deny the existence of a Holy and immortal God?  I marveled when the commentator was explaining the complex of a human cell.  (By the way, Buhl Planetarium in Pittsburgh had an outstanding video presentation of the human cell.  Check it out if you are ever in the area).
If you ever wondered why the world is so evil, consider Paul's message to the Romans:
""For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, 21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man--and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.
24 Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, 25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
26 For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. 27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.
28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality,[c] wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, 30 backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving,[d] unmerciful; 32 who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them.""
P.S. Who made the ingredients for the ""big bang?""",1221004800,10,3427,4.934027777777778
2518565,5,B000EGFUI2,"I like this DVD a lot. Very interesting and especially challenging material for those people who still believe in school-taught ""ape-man"" ancestry. God is so magnificent and great! Watch this DVD and you will understand that mankind was created and has a purpose.
Also, liked the multi-language feature and bonus material on Good News gospel presentation. I suggest it for nonbelieveres and believers alike.",1220745600,11,407,5.375
2518566,1,B000EGFUI2,"This video is hilarious. A bunch of non-scientist sit in front of the camera trying to pick apart the most widely held scientific theories of the day.  It is pretty obvious that the people they interview don't even understand these theories but that doesn't stop them from critiquing any flaw they think they can find.  Most of the arguments used are of the ""straw man"" type.

The video is fun to watch, just make sure you educate yourself and don't believe it's lies.",1208563200,17,468,4.614457831325301
2518567,1,B000EGFUI2,"I believe in the theory of evolution and this video supports that belief.  This video would make an excellent teaching tool on evolution.  Show it to every high school and college biology class at the end of the course and test the students' ability to discern a creationist view from an evolutionary theory.  A theory, by the way, isn't just some idea;  it's a complex set of ideas that has been tested over and over again with the latest observable information and has stood up to each test.  Creationism is not a theory; it's barely an idea, which is painfully apparent in this video.",1202428800,12,587,4.605769230769231
2518568,5,B000EGFUI2,"Did life on earth evolve over billions of years as taught by evolutionary science, or perhaps is life too complex to have simply and randomly come about through natural means alone?  This is the central issue of this video.

This video presents evidence for the supernatural origins of life, the universe, and earth, and attributes the creation to the God of the Bible. This program points out that evolutionary science and theory is not the certain fact that many present it as.  There are serious flaws and issues with the theory of evolution, and this video brings these to light.

Offering a logical alternative to evolutionary theory, this video then seeks to show how the Genesis account of creation by God makes more logical sense than random evolution.  Specific topics in Biology, Chemistry, and Cosmology are presented to show that Creationism by God is more likely than evolution.

The Creation-Evolution controversy is a heated one with both sides presenting their position as the certain final ""truth"".  The debate is likely to go on and on and never be fully proven by either side, as there were no human beings present at the creation to witness exactly what happened.  In the end it comes down to a matter of faith.  The existing scientific data is the same for both positions, yet it is how one interprets the data (and one's worldview) that makes the difference in opinion on this issue.  I don't believe that either evolution or creation can be 100% proven; there will always be speculation and doubt about both positions.  Therefore, it does come down to a matter of belief and faith.

This video is a well-produced, visually rich presentation that favors the Creationism point of view.  I invite the intellectually curious to explore both sides of the issue and come to an informed decision as

possible.

This video can be purchased as a DVD or VHS. The DVD is of course much easier to use than a VHS tape, and has better visual qualities, however, the same program is available in used condition on VHS tape format for a lesser price.  So if cost is a concern, get the used VHS version.

2518569,5,B000EGFUI2,"This is the best DVD on the Evolution/Creation debate I have seen.  In just 60 minutes, it does a great job of explaining the two theories side by side and then point to the observable evidence.  Which one is most logical, reasonable and fits what is actually true in nature and science?  It is very up-to-date, clear and interesting.",1174608000,24,334,4.627118644067797
2518570,5,B000EGFUI2,I watched it more than three times and I still like to watch this document once a while. It's worth to have it in your collection,1402617600,3,129,4.0
2518571,5,B000EGFUI2,"Excellent video - very visually rich, well produced and convincing. Features many highly qualified scientists who support the creationist position in a convincing manner. Very viewer-friendly and perhaps the best video covering all key aspects of the creation-evolution debate in a manner understandable to the educated layperson. Only drawback is a strange, totally unnecessary, opening sequence which presents the evolutionary viewpoint with no title or captioning to show this is the case.",1399334400,3,492,5.847222222222222
2518572,5,B000EGFUI2,Many international collegians come to our home. Great to view together and discuss the content. Well done.  Excellent presentation and photography.,1377561600,3,147,6.0
2518573,1,B000EGFUI2,"I watched this video on YouTube and I was only convinced on how dishonest it is. I reckon the only reason why creationist media exist is because it is legal to produce. If you ever watch this video or any other form of creationist media, then watch it on YouTube or any other video website and make sure it has some critical analysis by some anti-creationist blogger instead of rewarding some ignorant morons who enjoy making videos like this.",1369958400,5,443,4.620253164556962
2518574,5,B000EGFUI2,"If anyone out there feels underinformed on Darwins evolution, you should definately pick up this dvd, you will learn that evolution does not hold up against creation the way you may have thought it does, it is a great tool for your children also who are being taught in school that we all have evolved from chemicals in the sea...wake up and inform yourself knowledge is power!!!!.... you won't be disapointed !!!  =)",1363910400,5,417,4.712328767123288
2518575,1,B000EGFUI2,"The video is quite creative and imaginative in the way they present their ""facts.""  It is something like watching FOX News, if you have understanding of the subject you wonder how they can present their ideas with a straight face.  By the way evolution explains how life has changed over time.  It does not cover molecules to man and the origin of life.",1362182400,6,353,4.571428571428571
2518576,5,B000EGFUI2,"This movie covers a broad range of topics in countering the various types of evolution, from cosmic evolution to macro evolution.  It presents great science information in a very comprehensible way. The current theories of evolution currently contradict real science and it is clear if one studies the facts, evolution and science cannot go together. I do not refer to micro-evolution when talking about evolution.  I am referring to big bang, macro, organic, etc. The kind that is taught as fact but still has many holes which are not even raised in schools.  This raises many questions which evolution cannot answer and cannot explain.  As a teacher I loved this video and anyone who is willing to have an open mind should watch this. You will learn from this.  It really goes into the science behind every statement they claim in this video very well. Highly recommended.",1313539200,5,874,4.918367346938775
2518577,1,B000EGFUI2,"As an ordained minister and a professor of religion and ethical studies, I found this film to be appalling.  From start to finish is it filled with half-truths and lies as a way to persuade viewers to believe in creationism and to doubt evolution.  It is not a scientific debate.  If it were then all of the arguments made in the film could easily be refuted by looking to actual science. Creationist scientists by definition cannot be scientists because the scientific method requires one to objectively look at all evidence, not pick and choose which evidence best suits your argument.  Even as a minister, I understand that to be the definition of a conspiracy theorist.  I am living testimony that a person can still believe in God and evolution at the same time.  The two are not inconsistent with each other.  As Joseph Campbell stated, there is no problem between science and religion; however, there is a huge inconsistency between the science of today and the science of 3000 years ago.

Why do we need lies to defend the existence of God, when the experience of God is all around us and why does a definition of God have to fit within the meager limitations of the human mind?  It is videos like this that set human understanding, tolerance, and acceptance of religion back decades, if not more.  I will pray for the patience and understanding of those who made this film so that they might understand that lies are never good, especially in service of God.  I will also pray for those who watch this film so that they will see truth as it is rather than how it is presented in this film.",1306540800,17,1598,4.571929824561403
2518578,5,B000EGFUI2,"The data presented in this video needs to be widely disseminated.  In a world where academics who can't accept Darwinistic evolution as ""the gospel"" are ostracized or even fired (see Expelled), an alternative creationist presentation is more than needed.  The video presents a list of fundamental problems that simply cannot be overcome by evolutionary models or thought.  Even if you do not accept the Biblical account of creation, an even handed examination of all points of view would require consideration of the facts presented.",1299628800,4,533,5.321428571428571
2518579,5,B000EGFUI2,"A fair presentation of both sides of the issue and an exposition of the fantasies that the evolutionary crowd so adamantly clings to. The facts given in this DVD completely shatter every major premise that the theory of evolution is said to be built on. From cosmology to molecular particles, every attempt to apply an evolutionary model is systematically examined and refuted. If I were to give someone one piece of material on the subject of evolution/creationism it would be this one.",1283644800,10,487,4.951219512195122

8109515,1,B000EGFUI2,"Great viewing for children.  I love how the unqualified PhDs compare the Big Bang to artillery, fire crackers and hand grenades without study, investigation or seeking to understand.  They don't attempt to grasp therefore it MUST be God!  Seriously?  Really?

At least they didn't tell us the Earth is 6000 years old, at least not in the time I watched it.  'Bout 15 minutes.",1480464000,2,375,4.78125
8109516,4,B000EGFUI2,I like it a lot. It does come off as being one sided even if that is the side I think is right. I do not know what the short clips of young adults saying they where for one side or the other was for. It did a good job of pointing out some of the holes in the evolution theory.,1467072000,,276,3.540983606557377
8109517,5,B000EGFUI2,"This is a very well put together documentary, but it's not like many typically boring documentaries. It does such a good (and interesting) job of explaining the science behind the idea of intelligent design. It explains quite well that what we have here on earth is chemically, biologically, physically and statistically impossible to be the result of an accident. This is ideal for those who want to understand the facts and true science.
But if you are a close minded individual, you might not get as much out of it. Anyone who regards themselves as open minded should find it very enlightening. Would highly recommend buying this.",1446595200,4,633,4.925233644859813
