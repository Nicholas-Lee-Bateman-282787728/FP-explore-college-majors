7863312,2,6304163126,"Based on the rave reviews, I bought this for my husband. Rather than the ""clever"" or ""play on words"" type of humor we like, this is more like ""slapstick"" or ""laugh at the silly"". It is  great as far as good, clean fun goes, and is probably more funny to younger  people - even Jr. High/High School - than for us.",947376000,4,312,4.098360655737705
7863313,5,6304163126,Mark Lowery is so funny.  This video was super so is all his other ones.  I am looking for the one where he sings with the Gaither Trio and Mark takes off his shoe and sticks it in Bills face while Bill is singing.  Any  Idea what I am talking about?,922233600,2,250,3.843137254901961
7863314,5,6304163126,"This movie is hilarious!  5-star movie!!  I watch it again and again and by now I could almost recite the whole thing for you!  In this movie, Mark takes the average television show or commercial and twists it around a bit.  Guest stars, Bill Gaither, Carman, Steven Curtis.  You'll want to watch it  over and over.  Your sides will hurt!",913680000,5,338,4.533333333333333
