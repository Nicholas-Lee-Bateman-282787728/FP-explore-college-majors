3847689,2,B0024R1CGI,"For many years it used to be the image of Jason Voorhees when you think about a maniac killer roaming the woods and slaying campers, but after seeing this movie... well.... you still will.

Crispon Glover plays the worst role I have ever seen him do. The guy must be kicking himself that he screwed up by demanding more money to be in the Back To The Future sequels and is now remembered for his stupid idea he had to play a weirdo on the Letterman Show many years ago.

This role must have taken real desperation to play. Now this movie could have been something, something decent that is, but two actors in this movie ruined it for everyone else. The first is an annoying stoner character who does nothing but smoke joints throughout the movie and saying stupid things. He is the type you want to see killed off as soon as possible, but they dragged him out and gave him some lame attempt at trying to make out the stoner is a kick-244 hero in waiting, who is going to save the day and seek out the woman he has a crush on, and it just ends in you rolling your eyes at the pathetic attempt they make for the audience to see there is more to him then a stoner with no future.

Then there is Crispon Glover playing Simon. First off, the story behind this character doesn't pay off, there is supposed ghosts or just weirdos who won't stay in that town that give the back story of Simon and his brother, in which the scene was not needed as there is no pay off later as to what the hell it was put in for other then some stupid way to tell the backstory, but done in such a lame way that it leaves plot holes open.

Then there is the accent of this character. Plain and simple, it is either the most annoying and worst accent you will ever hear because it's just that bad, or you just know Crispons voice too well that you do not accept it is his voice.

The kills in the movie are not that bad, and the story itself was decent, but it is those two actors that killed the movie with there performance, that and keeping the stoner in 45 minutes too long.

As I said before, it seems like Crispon is kicking himself for not doing Back To The Future 2 & 3, as he trys to recreate a little scene in this movie like that of in BTTF when he lays out Biff. The same shot of the clenching fist is recreated in this film, but I did not see it as a calling card, or tribute, or homage to that scene, as more a desperate attempt at trying to add something to gain more attention to himself.

All this movie needed was the stoner cut down early, and either Crispon replaced or have him play it in a way you can stand instead of laugh at how bad it is. And it would not suprise me if Crispon thought he was being artistic or innovative to play a character that is a friggen joke and badly acted while mostly everyone else put all there effort into there roles.",1248220800,,2845,4.115315315315315
3847690,2,B0024R1CGI,"Despite the fact that this low budget, B-movie Slasher has a ""star"" in it, I definitely wasn't expecting a lot from this film when I rented it. It was perhaps a little better than I had expected, but still, this movie isn't good by any means. The plot of the film isn't that bad, but the execution of the idea is. The writing is poor and the acting, though I've seen much worse, isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. Crispin Glover's performance leaves something to be desired. The character he portrays is much too over-the-top and cheesy. However, I will say that the gore is decent for a film like this. And there are some good kill scenes;one involving a dog got a big chuckle from me! Nonetheless, there's really not too many reasons that anyone should watch this film, unless your just a horror movie buff and have some time on your hands. Check this one out if you must, but I wouldn't waste my money buying it. A one-time viewing is all this movie is worth.",1247529600,,974,4.416666666666667
3847691,3,B0024R1CGI,"""Simon Says""Gives you a big dose of over the top acting by Crispin Glover .although effective for the role's he's playing,Psychotic twins that killed they're parents as children and now live in the woods where they have set booby trap after booby trap that effectively kill quite a few people who just want to camp and have a good time in grisly ways .
The cast is good and the acting is well done. Of course there is that element of dark humor that ensues with alot of the slashers today,That's one reason Glovers performance works,it's not to be taken too seriously but seriously enough to delight the slasher fan.,Blake Lively of gossip Girl is only in the film for about 3 minutes so I don't know why she was even used.

There is gore galore and that's always good because that's why we watch these movies , that combined with good characters and  cool story..
There's a scene where a boy is burned alive that is particularly disturbing. The rest of the kills are pretty good as well but usual slasher fare. The weapon of choice a pick axe.
Bottom line is if you're a slasher fan and especially a slasher in the woods slasher fan or a Crispin Glover fan you won't be disappointed by this movie.

3847693,3,B0024R1CGI,"I am positively shocked. I bought a 5 disc horror collection el cheapo multi pack two movies of which I've watched and would be surprised if they were even made by college kids they were that bad but recently I was scratching around saw the multi-pack and remembered why I even bought it for $5 a couple of years ago.

 One of them a 'Simon Says' movie starred Crispin Glover so I popped it in expecting something to help me drift off to sleep and initially with it's clearly budget atmosphere it was working but once Crispin Glover truly appears on the scene I was wide awake. A delightfully insane performance talking gibberish, yelling, screaming etc along with some inventive kills and more decent gore than you expect from a film like this made it quite an enjoyable viewing.

 Simon Says really did surprise the hell out of me and is too good of a movie to be lumped in a 5 feature horror collection for $5 from a discount store.",1463702400,,935,4.450292397660819

Hell, these people deserved to die because they knew what was going to happen from the start.  There's no suspense.

I guess it's the liberal bias and political correctness of Hollywood that the bad guys in this genre are NEVER atheist, agnostic. And NEVER EVER black. As to the movie itself, basically a long series of violence with increasingly bizarre Rube Goldberg weaponry. (""Gatling guns"" that throw axes...are you kidding me?) The girls are cute, but there's nowhere near enough nudity so much of their cuteness is wasted. Acting is decent except that lead retardo is insanely over-acting and the director screws up by giving him endlessly too much wasted time for his over-acting.

3847738,3,B0024R1CGI,"A stereotypical slasher set in the woods, Simon Says (2006) features a group of college kids on vacation, who run into a demented killer.  With a healthy dose of gore, creative kills, and inventive instruments of death, the film has elements that may appeal to fans of the genre, however the kooky killer played by Crispin Glover, who has some rather particular personality traits which may be a little too much for some to take.

On their way to a campsite in the woods, a group of five kids stop off at a gas station/general store that is run by twin brothers Simon and Stanley (both played by Glover in a dual role).  Upon reaching their destination, the group begins to relax, but their fun is soon interrupted by a maniac who specializes in camouflage, and utilizes some uniquely wicked weapons that feature pickaxes.  One spectacular kill involves a weapon that fires a pickaxe with chain attached, that plunges into the back of a victim, who is reeled in and then mutilated.  The killer also employs traps with spinning reels with embedded pickaxes, and enjoys hanging his victims by the neck.

The killer speaks to his victims in a horrible southern accent, as his irritating shtick incorporates the kid's game Simon says.  This silly routine, and the killer's whole lame persona, gets tired really fast, and only the frequent and dramatic kills, make the film of interest, as he creatively butchers some adventure loving types, looking to play wargames, before focusing on Kate (Margo Harshman) and Zack (Greg Cripes), the last of the college kids.

The concluding confrontation, while featuring much too much annoying banter, does include a barbecue, and a machete strike to the head.  The film's dark ending is a nice touch, but it's unfortunate that the story made the killer a little too whacky, and played up the theatrical horror/comedy elements to annoyingly excessive levels.  If the intensity was dialed down a bit, and the killer given a more serious demeanor, Simon Says could have been a real winner, although Cripsin Glover certainly appears to have enjoyed overplaying his roles.

Although their dramatic talents won't win any awards, the rest of the cast meet the physical challenges of their roles fairly well.  The various contraptions that incorporate pickaxes are cool, and for the most part, the nicely executed kill scenes are the best things about the film.  Some may find that Glover's act wears thin and becomes annoying, however if you enjoy a theatrical madman with a twisted sense of humor, you might just like Simon Says.",1336262400,,2558,4.920930232558139
3847739,4,B0024R1CGI,"A group of kids in a van head out to the woods to pan for gold(and get laid of course) and run into a backwoods lunatic, and tra-la....tra-la.....tra-la. Zero, repeat, zero here will surprise the viewer.  Everything is strictly by the numbers here.  One minute after meeting our cast of victims you want them all to die horrible deaths, even the ""nice"" girl.
So why in God's name did I give this crud four stars???  The magic two words: Crispin Glover.  The forever nutty Glover, who comes across as a headcase when he's playing it straight, really gets to let go here.  Granted, his psycho isn't one of the more charismatic slasher psychos of all time and probably won't go down as such in horror film history, but it really is fun to watch him, especially when he does things like offer a woman a ""hand sandwich"" and brutally squashes a small dog with one mighty stomp right in front of it's owners.  One of the very few bits of originality on display here is a mechanical catapult that launches pickaxes....like tons of pickaxes.  There's also a homemade saw apparatus that, when triggered by a tripwire(Glover likes his boobytraps), flies out of the bushes and takes the legs off of an unlucky paintballer.
So, I can certainly see why folks may not like this film as it is derivative of just about every backwoods slasher flick out there.  But Glover is one thing that makes it fun and keeps it from being a two star deal.",1320451200,2,1426,4.54296875

3847742,5,B0024R1CGI,"Simon Says is a REALLY gross horror film about five teenagers who go on a camping trip. Upon arriving to the forest... typical teenage relationship drama takes up the first 30 minutes of storytelling BUT!!!

Keep watching!! It actually improves!!

When the actual killing extravaganza gets underway (involving a killer named -you guessed it- a guy actually named Simon!) *this* is when the movie really wins me over.

Simon obviously has mental problems. He's also insanely jealous of his twin brother. None of that really matters though, because the main focus is definitely on the *extremely* bloody and creative ways Simon goes crazy on these five innocent teenagers.

I really want that axe-shooting machine! How awesome would it be to walk around through the woods with a machine capable of flinging several axes in the air at lightning speed? Would make hunting a breeze, I tell ya!

Much of the focus is definitely on how the teenagers get slaughtered up with blood and guts dripping from tree branches and stuff. Yes it's enough to make any normal person sick, but hey, the same thing happens to animals and we eat delicious chicken all the time! ""Please don't kill me! I don't want MY blood pouring swiftly all over the forest!""

Anyway, yes- this is definitely one exceptionally violent horror film. Expect one brutal death after another for the entire second half.  It takes a little while for the actual storyline to kick in, but rest assured- it *will* eventually kick in, and kicks in with a vengeance.",1291766400,,1516,4.875486381322958
3847743,4,B0024R1CGI,"Okay, Now that I've finally seen slasher film ""Simon says"", I can write down what I really felt about Crispin Glover being in it. Well, to be honest, when I knew about him taking this role of Stanley/Simon, I thought to myself, he did this before. ""Drop Dead Sexy"" is the other movie where he had a hillbilly accent. But, he really laid this character flat on the table. You could say that he was into his character in a weird, cocky, wacky and scary way. Of course it was bloody and creatively gory with the victims being slashed to pieces. And Blake Lively and her sister appeared and they look a lot alike. What I don't know is that Crispin might have a younger brother or son in this film. Boy, did he make me laugh. That's why I can't stop thinking about this movie, because he made being a killer fun and wild. Besides, he made Stanley look so...good. Anyway, he had some very creative ways to kill the teens. Never seen an pickaxe-thrower machine in any other horror movie, it was neat. So was the other weapon that he used. The only thing I didn't like about Stanley (or) Simon is that he kills dogs. I'll never get used to a dog-killing maniac, that was the only flaw the film had. To have Crispin laugh and crack jokes while scaring the teens to death is indeed a treat. He looked like he was having fun. To put this to a close, I'll never forget about this movie. I'll take this over ""Wizard of Gore"" any day.

3847751,4,B0024R1CGI,"Simon Says is a slasher movie along the lines of Wrong Turn and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only it has a slap happy Crispin Glover standing in for the cannibals. There's also a lot of dark comedy bits in this one. And one scene reminded me of a scene from Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives, you know where people playing paint ball start getting killed off one by one. Oh, yeah, this movie is gory. If you're tired of PG-13 horror or horror that plays it straight, then give Simon Says a chance. You might just be entertained like I was.",1250121600,2,537,4.2745098039215685

8350824,3,B0024R1CGI,"The gonzo Crispin Glover plays twins in this ordinary horror film. The murder weapon of choice is a whole lotta pickaxes set up as booby traps, but it is Glover's off-kilter acting that makes this film more watchable than it has a right to be. If you are used to watching this on Chiller or SyFy, you are missing some extremely nasty gore that is cut for TV. If you are a Crispin Glover fan, this film is a must. If you are not a Crispin Glover fan, consider this your normal DTV horror film.",1496620800,,492,4.189473684210526
8350825,2,B0024R1CGI,"This movie is okay. If you are buying because you thought it has Blake Lively in it so, it might be good, don't. They advertise her in it to sell movies. She is in it for approx 1 min at the end.",1467849600,2,195,3.6666666666666665
