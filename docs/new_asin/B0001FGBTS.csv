1997135,3,B0001FGBTS,"For a low budget movie, I did not find this movie as awful as others have. If you have had the misfortune as I have of seeing Dark Harvest 2, you will Really appreciate this movie!! Dark Harvest 2, which I also reviewed is one of the sorriest movies I've ever seen and has nothing to do with this movie. OK horror flick, especially if you like scarecrow movies. To sum it up, a young man inherits a old farm and brings along some friends with him to see if the farmhouse is in good enough condition to be sold. What they do not know is that years ago, a farmer killed his wife and hung her as a scarecrow. Naturally, we see the scarecrow come to life. Taking place deep in the isolated mountains, Dark Harvest has some good/cool scenes. I myself think the scarecrow is rather cool! I'd recommend renting this movie. I think anyone would say.... I've seen much worse!!",1141257600,2,867,4.325153374233129

1997143,4,B0001FGBTS,"Okay, to state the obvious: on a technical scale ""Dark Harvest"" isn't exactly the best-produced movie out there, nor did its makers have unlimited resources to draw on.  Now to state the more important: ""Dark Harvest"" is a better, more entertaining, more wathable and more earnest picture than many films with a hundred times its budget and technical finesse Harvest's makers could only grasp at.  It scores most of its points on 3 fronts: premise, performers, and characters.

  Its premise has a 25-or-so guy inheriting an old, rundown farmhouse and field out in the middle of isolation, and heading out with a group of friends to check it out and see if the place is sellable.  It seems the fields of the property were vastly fruitful cornfields during years of drought that turned all the surrounding farms to dust; decades later it is long abandoned and shunned by the nearby town.  Alright, step one is taken care of - if that's not a fine opening plot for a horror movie I don't know what is.  Next, performers - some are merely competent but several are actually quite impressive.  This leads right into step three, characters - the characters seem very real with their own personalities and personal traits that many movies seem to forget to add in.  Especially likable is the girl played by Jessica Dunphy, who as a bonus during the pondside scene (which also features some other attractive females) bares one of the most beautiful backsides ever captured on film.  To be honest though, she could have still lit up the screen with cute appeal and her character's quietly energetic, bright-and-friendly personality, even if she'd worn an ill-fitting sweatshirt and baggy cargopants the whole movie.  I'm glad she didn't though.

  The movie does run into trouble with its scarecrow effects.  A significant suspension of disbelief is required on the viewer's part to accept these as real.  Helping with that suspension, the cast credibly acts as they're facing truly threatening, visually frightening entities.

  I would actually love to see a bigger budget remake of this with the same cast but with some more experience under the belts of the filmmakers, and maybe some more accomplished techicians brought in to help out.  Don't wait for a remake that's probably never going to happen, though.  As it is, with all its bumpiness, this is still a fine movie.

  I'd give this at least a seven out of ten, maybe a bit higher; definate four out of five stars rather than three.  It's more forgivable for a movie to hit snags due to lack of funds and apparant lack of experience on the part of the well-intentioned filmmakers, than it is to have all the mega-accomplished producers and directors in the world and limitless money and still hit snag after snag and inconsistency after inconstintency due to apparant lack of concern.",1098576000,10,2837,4.870563674321503
1997154,3,B0001FGBTS,"Iv'e seen quite a few movies dealing with killer scarecrows like ""Scarecrows"" (1988), and ""Night Of The Scarecrow"" (1995). The low-budget and lack of special effects make it more creepy. This movie is pretty average about a group of friends who go and stay in an abandoned farm-house surrounded by vast corn fields in West Virginia. The land was owned by one of the guy's great grandfathers and he inherited it. Rumors were circulating around town about the area being haunted. Supposedly the great grandfather who lived there back in 1932 summoned and made a deal with the devil to keep his crops alive during a drought. His crops were the only crops in the county to be alive. The grandfather became evil himself and killed his wife. The friends are warned that when the harvest moon rises the evil spirits will return for a bloody vengence. And sure enough, the spirits possess the scarecrows and come alive. They have glowing red eyes and make bloodcurdling screams, creepy. The friends are running for their lives as the scarecrows scream and chase them with mechetties, hooks, knives, and hatchets through the corn fields. You'll probably laugh more than scream even if you watch it at night. It ain't that scary.",1097539200,,1219,4.837320574162679

Does anyone else feel as RIPPED OFF and foolish as I do when I rent stinkers like this?  For those of you who haven't seen it:  plodding, poorly (VERY) poorly acted, totally crap script, NO special effects (guy wearing junk mask).  Seriously, this isn't even in the same galaxy as some fun, low budget movies -- this is watching a junior high school home video camera experment and the producer, director -- whover -- are laughing all the way to the bank.  All the money was obviously put into the cover art.  I can't believe how much this infuriates me!  Anyway, I agree with the review below regarding the actress doing the HORRIBLE ""British"" accent -- was this your idea because you can not even come CLOSE to convincing anyone of its authenticity.  This was just one of the reasons I would have hurled this crap out the window if I hadn't rented it.  Do not be fooled by ANY of the reviews here that claim it ha any redeeming qualities -- just look at the tremendous contrast in reviews and note that the bas FAR outweigh the good.

1997159,1,B0001FGBTS,"Dark Harvest is an amazingly inept way to take an interesting idea and completely defile it.  Wisely shying away from the old run-of-the-mill slasher formula, the film adds a supernatural touch while attempting to build a mood where you anticipate how the story will play out.  It's an unfortunate thing that... nothing at all happens.  As the film loses any type of momentum, the plot diminshes to scarecrows in bad makeup chasing scantly clad young adults with sharp objects.  At this point, I expect the acting in these grade Z horror films to be bad, put I expect that the cast look like they're trying to emote... something.  The actor's in Dark Harvest look like they barely care that they're being chased and killed.

I have to say, I wasn't really disappointed at all.  Sure, its cheesy and fairly cheaply made, but knowing it was a local production, I wasn't expecting a Lucas production!  The acting was decent, the locales great and the script wasn't bad for the most part.  The ""special effects"" weren't high caliber but there were a few ""jumpy"" moments in it that were enough to satisfy me.

As an indication of how poorly this film was put together, the very first scene in the film contains subtitles that identify the location as ""West Virgina"" [sic]. Yes, that's right.

Unforutnatly I picked this up at a store and thinking that it was priced at 17.99 it at least should have been fairly entertaining.
Heck, All I need to do is go to my local halloween store and pick up a rubber mask and put on some farmer clothes and I would make a great scarecrow in this movie.
It was soo bad, but me having my pride, watched the entire movie.. although be it, the last 30 minutes in FAST-Foward motion. BLECH... It is bad enough for me to come on line and start typing to tell ANYONE that this was just horrible..

It looked like they bought skeleton masks at Wal-mart during Halloween and used them for this movie. The fake blood looked more like chocolate syrup with cherry sauce mixed in. The lighting in the movie looked so forced and fake that it constantly reminds you that this is a movie.

8012010,4,B0001FGBTS,"First off, one thing everyone reading thing review should know is that in NO WAY am I saying that this film is good in the traditional way, it ISN'T! But if you're a horror buff like me and respect the traditional elements of a horror\slasher film sometimes that alone can make up for any shortcomings in the film making department.

The story of Dark Harvest surrounds a young man who discovers he owns a property (an old farm house) left down to him by some old relative or something like that. Of coarse, this being a slasher movie he invites all of his friends to come ""break in"" the house so to speak, by having a party. Soon, as bodies start to pileup, they realize that the scarecrows surrounding the property are alive, and stalking them.

Okay, if you ever watch this movie it will be quickly apparent that this production is amateur hour at best, from the direction, to the acting, to the writing, as well as the production design. The one good thing film making wise I will give it is that it seems to have been shot on film (I'm guessing.)

From frame one, you know what you're getting yourself into, so, why not take it for what it is, and judge it for what it is-a really low budget, amateur production at best, but a FUN one to watch.

If you try to see the good in this film (which it is hard to do) there are several things the director manages to pull off, teenagers, well, in this case mid-twenty somethings in a house, off, in the middle of nowhere-check!
A psycho killer, in this case, possessed scarecrows-check!
Gore-check!
And without a doubt the best thing about this film HOT NAKED CHICKS! Gratuitous nudity-check!

Okay, before I offend anyone out there, please people, save it! This is a horror movie, in fact, a slasher movie and we expect a little T&A. It's been a classic element in the genre for well over thirty years now and I get the impression that even female horror movie fans themselves look forward to a little nudity in these films, and this element may be the only thing that the director really knocked out of the ball park, as it seems like every chick in this movie strips to down to her birthday suit at some point or another, with one chick (the curvy brunette) being one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen in a horror movie. I appreciate the fact that thing director is no doubt a BUTT man, as he never manages to not get a great back shot of his nude actresses and man does that brunette have a WHOOOOOOOOOTY!!!!!!

This is something he also delivered on in another film of his, The Feeding. I seriously would put the brunette's gratuitous nude scene up there with Debisue Voorhees' nude scene in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. They both are classics!

With that being said, this isn't great film making, by any means, but it is fun and entertaining, if you can see past the amateur production value.

...And unless you ate this particular DVD, putting whatever comes out into your player will be more entertaining than this film.

To give credit where credit is due, the plot of this movie isn't too shabby. In the Great Depression, a hard-pressed farmer named Elijah Baker made a pact with the Devil: he would sacrifice the migrant farmhands that drifted from ranch to ranch in exchange for a bountiful harvest, stringing their corpses up on crosses and dressing them up as scarecrows. As depicted by a series of D-grade TV actors in the opening sequence, local law enforcement in ""West Virgina"" confront Baker when they suspect something, and in the ensuing shootout the farmer is eliminated.

Now, in the present day, Sean (Don Digiulio), a direct descendant of Baker, inherits the farm when his biological father--who has never met--dies. He doesn't want to even bother taking a look at the property, but his fianc convinces him to make it a trip along with several friends. The young kids head out to the isolated farm and prepare to spend a week. Little do they know that on the coming ""blood moon"", the farmhands killed by Baker will take revenge on any of Baker's blood-relatives.

If this movie had a decent budget, a decent production crew, and a decent cast, this plot could have given way to a C-horror movie. Instead, what we are left with is hollow, poorly directed, terribly acted piece of trash so vile that it's offensive.

The acting is hands-down terrible. While the supporting cast is OK (how can you mess up saying typical ""teen"" one-liners?), the brunt of the script necessarily falls upon the shoulders of Don, whose only positive attribute is an ability to put emotion into saying the F word. Unfortunately, his borderline-mentally challenged mannerisms while swearing tend to ruin their effect. But, the best part of all...Don gets a haircut in the middle of the film. No joke. One minute, he's running from the scarecrows, bangs swinging in his face; the next, he's running from the same scarecrow sporting a more aerodynamic hairdo. Ah, but maybe the shooting last a year or so, and Don was left with no choice but to trim his hair? Maybe, except that it was filmed within three weeks. Never has the film world seen an actor so devoted to his craft.

The piss-poor acting could have been tolerable if, by some strange circumstance, the scarecrow monsters had been believable (i.e., they looked anything like they do on the cover). Instead, they are hopelessly crappy looking morons that stumble around and grunt and roar in rage as if they've seen this film. But wait, their eyes...they flash! Please. These are without a doubt the worst monsters to ever grace the silver screen; being direct-to-video, at least it wasn't a theater one (note: after seeing Dark Harvest 2, these creatures become only the second worst monsters of all time).

So, what will it be? Buy? Rent? Urinate on? I'd recommend the third, but that usually would necessitate either of the first two options, so I'm just going to go with AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1164412800,,3090,4.796992481203008
