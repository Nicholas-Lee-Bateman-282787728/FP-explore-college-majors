8279617,4,B001ATE1SM,"It's been a long time (40 years) when I had my MMA/JKD lessons so this was a great refresher. It brought back much of what my teacher taught me and then a few techniques that were new to me. However I do not recommend this to someone who has never had personal lessons, as there is much that a beginner needs to be shown person to person to appreciate this tape. As to the supplier I got the tape on time in very good condition. Black Belt Magazine should put this on a DVD!",1398988800,,474,4.053191489361702
