7937352,4,B00005BH22,"If this is your first Rigoletto, may I humbly suggest that you first see Rigoletto as performed by Riccardo Chailly and Vienna (Pavarotti, Wixell, Gruberova) or James Levine and the MET (Domingo, MacNeil, Cotrubas). I suggest this merely because this particular live performance in the Teatro Regio in Parma is too poorly lighted to give you a good introduction to the magnificence of Rigoletto. Really, there's no other way to say it than to say it looks as if it was staged during a power outage. Many of the scenes are too poorly-lit to see who is singing or what is going on. Perhaps the theater in Parma simply did not have adequate lighting in 1987 to show this performance in its best light.

So, why would anyone want to see this particular video of a poorly-lighted live performance of Rigoletto??

First, the tenor singing the Duke of Mantua is the incomparable Alfredo Kraus. Thankfully, many of his scenes are in the light! When he finishes the famous aria, ""La donna e mobile,"" and holding that final high note for several seconds more than is possible for most tenors, the audience continues to applaud for what seems an endless time. (It must have felt rewarding to the master singer, Alfredo Kraus, to have such a continuing ovation of appreciative applause.)

Leo Nucci as Rigoletto, and Luciana Serra as Gilda, also bring great voices to this performance. At the end of Act 2, with Rigoletto swearing revenge, and Gilda begging him to forgive the duke, both singers ""stick"" their high notes to the thunderous applause of the audience, and minutes later, at their curtain calls before Act 3, they are hugging each other--aware of what fine singing they've done before an awed audience.

And so, in spite of the problems about lighting, this is a fine audio performance, and a chance to see and hear Alfredo Kraus. It's almost like seeing and hearing Enrico Caruso. Like the old primitive recordings of Caruso's magnificent voice, I'm glad we have this chance to see and hear Alfredo Kraus, even if not in the best lighting for a performance.",1456704000,,2058,4.788732394366197

7937354,5,B00005BH22,"Buy this for the singing. It is the best Rigoletto for singing. It has the incomparable Alfredo Kraus in one of his signature roles as the Duke of Mantua, Leo Nucci in the title tole, and Lucianna Serra as Gilda. All the singers are in great voice and at the top of their careers. Vocally it is the best Rigoletto there is - and Kraus far outshines Pavarotti and Domingo with his bright clear bell-like tones.

Now the Video is about 1 star. It is really awful - dark, camera wobbles, scenes in the dark are barely visible - but I didn't care. If you just want to see there are plenty of prettier Rigolettos' out there to buy.  It looks like it was shot from the back row of the opera house. This was not even a TV production -- I suspect. But if you want great singing then you must get this DVD.

However, if you are new to opera and this is your first Rigoletto on DVD you will be happier with Pavarotti. But if like me, you own many copies of Rioletto, then this is a must. You have to have ALfredo Kraus in the title role - he is probably the best Duke of Mantua ever.",1356048000,3,1073,4.075829383886256
7937355,4,B00005BH22,"This is one of those wonderful permformances, wish I had been there! I gather the recording wasn't intended for general sale, but it was such a good show they released it in spite of the poor visual recording. The lighting is so bad there are patches where you can't see the singers, but you can hear them...  I have several versions of Rigoletto. This is the one I watch for ""goose-bumps"". One of my all time favourite dvds.",1354406400,,425,4.448717948717949
7937356,1,B00005BH22,"Trust me.  Don't buy this DVD.  I understand that Kraus is a wonderful Duke and Nucci a top-notch Rigoletto.  The problem is not with the singers.  The problem is that the makers of this DVD/video should never have tried to sell it commercially.  The production values are terrible.

The sound quality is about a C- and the lighting is a solid F.  For example, the scene in Act I where Rigoletto meets Sparafucile is all but completely dark.  For a few moments I thought my TV tube was broken.

Even when you can see what is going on, it is very poorly lit.  There are other Rigoletto DVD's (e.g. one with Placido Domingo as the Duke) that are professionally produced.  This one is an insult to the Maestro, Guiseppe Verdi who would hire Sparafucile to deal with whoever was responsible for selling this for 20 scudi.  (or whatever)",1173830400,8,832,4.547297297297297
7937357,4,B00005BH22,"This is a well sung Rigoletto.  Alfredo Kraus stands out head over shoulder.  His ""Parmi veder le lagrime"" is the best i've heard,and he includes the cabeletta. Leo Nucci sings with a tenderness that I've missed in his other performances.  The only quams I have are with the lighting and scenery.  There are times you cannot see the stage and I found that frustrating.",1102723200,11,368,4.703125
7937358,1,B00005BH22,"I am very much interested in verdis rigoletto in general, owning several already. The problem with this and other operas is that no singers names, etc. are provided. I think it would be a good idea if this could be done, since we have to guess what we are getting if bought. thank you.",1057449600,9,285,4.296296296296297
7937359,5,B00005BH22,"It's true that the picture gets pretty dark. Apparently the video recording was done with normal theatrical lighting instead of the brighter lighting customarily used for televised stage performances. But I can see clearly everything I need to see, and picture quality is the last thing I'm thinking about when I listen to this superb performance.
I bought this DVD to have a video documentation of Alfredo Kraus' Duke. Although he was about 60 years old at the time of this performance, his singing is flawless in tone, technique, and style. The only other DVD assumption of this role that can compare to Kraus' is Luciano Pavarotti's (in the Ponnelle film). Pavarotti plays up the Duke's lechery, whereas Kraus emphasizes his aristocratic mien. Pavarotti's voice is more sumptuous, but Kraus's distinctive tone fits the music perfectly, and his singing of ""Parmi veder"" is superior to Pavarotti's. Kraus interpolates a high ""D"" at the conclusion of ""Possente amor"" that obviously thrills the notoriously finicky Parma audience, which later demands (but does not receive) an encore of ""La donna e mobile.""
Although I thought of Kraus as the main attraction when I bought this DVD, it is Leo Nucci's performance of the title role that makes this a great performance. Nucci's singing is the best I have ever heard from him in any role. I had always thought of him as a vocally reliable but bland interpreter, but on this occasion he projects the essence of Rigoletto's character in a way that is both moving and beautiful to hear. His voice is in marvelous condition. He has the breath control and legato for ""Deh, non parlare"" and the powerful top notes for ""Si, vendetta."" He is even better than Ingvar Wixell (in the Ponnelle film).
Luciana Serra (Gilda) is not quite in the same class as her two colleagues, but she sings well and looks good and her powerful top notes are an advantage in the ""Si, vendetta"" duet with Nucci. The rest of the cast is good, and although Angelo Campori may not be the most renowned of maestros, his conception of this opera is right on the money. The production is attractive and traditional, without any of the directorial stupidities seen in the Ponnelle film. All in all, this is my favorite video of Rigoletto.
My recommendation: don't worry about the picture; you'll get used to it. Buy this DVD and concentrate on the performance.",1029283200,12,2369,4.851851851851852
7937360,3,B00005BH22,THIS DVD TRANSFER HAS A LOT TO BE DESIRE.

7937361,3,B00005BH22,"Buyer beware when purchasing this video.  This performance was probably not an Italian Telecast, but a ""house tape"" with very few close-ups, only two or three cameras, and the results are an incredibly dark and murky picture.  Consider the fact that most of this opera takes place at night, in dark streets and alleyways, and I think you can figure out, this video is only for the most dedicated opera collector.  Certain scenes, the first one and the beginning of the third act after
Gilda's abduction, are more brilliantly lighted -- so much more can be made out on the small screen.  The performance is from Parma and you will get a sense of occasion because the audience is quite demonstrative and in many places brings the performance to a complete hault with its enthusiastic screaming and yelling. The audience demands and ALMOST gets an encore of Kraus's ""La donna e immobile"".  The performance, on the other hand, is quite another matter. The three ""names"" in this video give truly brilliant and moving performances.  Anyone who saw Kraus in his rather lengthy prime will want this performance just as an audio memento.  Brilliance, style, taste and ease are all part of this artist's pallet.  Leo Nucci sings and acts the living daylights out of almost every moment he is on stage.  Occasional sharpness betrays the fact that this is a live and therefore imperfect performance -- but  just listen to his ringing A-flat at the end of the Vendetta duet with Gilda (her E-flat just before it is one of the most lengthy and brilliantly sustained this listener has ever heard)...and you will begin to appreciate the power this genuine Verdi baritone brings to this role.  Luciana Serra, an amazing Queen of the Night in Magic Flute shows that singing Mozart is not her only strength.  Gilda suits her in that she has plenty of floaty and easy notes ""in alt"" with enough power and ""cut"" in the voice to carry over a powerful Verdi orchestra when she has to.  The production (that which you can make out) is traditional and the courtiers costumes in the party scenes are quite ornate and colorful.  Angelo Campori's conducting is somewhat routine, but neither is he intrusive or willful and the singers are almost always in sinc with the orchestra.  This performance from February, 1987 will not be pleasing to everyone's eye, but it will surely please and stun your ear.  If you insist on state of the art DVD technology, put this DVD back in the bin.  But if you love great singing and want to attend an ""event"", this is  the Rigoletto for you.",989798400,24,2549,4.715575620767495
