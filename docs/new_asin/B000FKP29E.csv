8124334,5,B000FKP29E,The item came new and was very informational on winning and playing the lottery. I recented a lot of tips for this video.,1373328000,,121,4.304347826086956
8124335,3,B000FKP29E,"The documentary comes off as being a bit one-sided as it shows all the negative aspects of the lottery.  I'm not sure what I expected from this video, but from the point of view of someone who is simply curious to learn more on the topic, this did seem to promote the idea that state-sponsored lotteries are immoral.

If I were doing research on the topic of lotteries, I might give this four stars.  However, from the point of view of a curious viewer, I give it 2.5 stars.",1209513600,,474,4.303370786516854
8124336,3,B000FKP29E,"This work interviews both people who support and condemn lotteries.  However, the work clearly falls on the side of condemning them.

It spells things out.  Minors have easy access to buying scratch-off tickets.  People can become addicted to lottos.  Also, the funds do not address education and seniors as they claim.  I was not happy seeing Calvin Butts interviewed as he has made homophobic comments in the past.

Still, this work is dated!  It features Senator Paul Simon who died at least five years ago.  It even shows the World Trade Center towers standing.  Bill Curtis ends by saying, ""Maybe one day the lotto will be curbed.""  Well, it's a decade after this production aired and lotto is stronger than ever and the clouds have not fallen from the sky.",1195862400,4,762,4.7846153846153845
