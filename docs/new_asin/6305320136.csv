As a result of this, inside was a coupon that had expired in 1996. Ha! Overall, great product, and I recommend this if you have a vhs player and enjoy watching the simpsons.",1492560000,,325,4.620689655172414

7887393,5,6305320136,"This is a fantastic boxed set!! I am a huge Simpsons fan, I own almost all of the boxed sets, and this is definitely one of my favorites. This one has a great mix of episodes. Volume 10 has ""Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington."" Lisa wins an essay contests and gets to compete in the national competition in Washington DC. While there, she finds out her congressman is corrupt and loses faith in the government and democracy. This episode is hilarious-you'll especially appreciate if you do or have ever lived in DC. The next episode is ""When Flanders Failed."" Ned chucks it all to start his beloved Leftorium, and Homer does all he can to prevent Ned from getting business. The Flanders' clan ends up losing their home and everything they own, which Homer buys for $20! This is a great early episode, essential to the history of Homer's animosity toward Flanders. Volume 11 has ""Bart the Murder."" Bart starts working for Fat Tony and the other Mafia guys, and ends up getting framed for Principal Skinner's murder! This episode is a must see, funny from begining to end. It's a great example of Simpsons humor, with lots of pop culture references. Next is ""Like Father, Like Clown."" Bart and Lisa try to reunite a distraught Krusty the Clown with his estranged rabbi father. This is great, you get to see where Krusty came from, and there are wonderful references to the Torah, Kabbalah, Bart even quotes famous rabbis and Sammy Davis, Jr. A super episode also for anyone who has studied Judaism-you'll really appreciate this one!! Volume 12 has ""Treehouse of Horror II."" This is part of the reason I like this boxed set-you not only get regular episodes, but older shows and a Halloween Special. Lisa, Bart, and Homer all have nightmares because they eat too much candy on Halloween. A reprise of Poe' ""The Monkey's Paw,"" ""The Twilight Zone,"" and ""Frankenstein."" The last episode is ""Lisa'a Pony."" Homer tries to buy Lisa's love with a pony, but the expense causes him to get a night job at the Kwik-E-Mart!! Overall, this is a great sampling of Simpsons episodes. Any avid fan will love it, and any casual watcher will find it hilarious!!",998697600,9,2133,4.690666666666667
7887394,5,6305320136,"Attention all Simpsons fans. This boxed set of videos includes some of the best Simpsons episodes ever created by Matt Groening. ""Lisa's Pony"" is hilarious since it depicts Homer's struggle to balance two jobs at once in order to help support the pony he bought Lisa in order to win her love back. He barely gets a wink of sleep. Another true favorite included here is ""Bart the Murderer,"" which once again features the hilarious mobster, Fat Tony. Bart takes a job working for them and is soon blamed for Principal Skinner's disappearance and ""murder."" The episode where Lisa goes to Washington illustrates how Lisa's faith in democracy is diminished once she witnesses corrupt politicians plotting to embezzle money.",997660800,2,718,5.042016806722689
7887395,5,6305320136,The Simpsons is the greatest show on television as far as I'm concerned (but you already knew that).  These boxed sets are great for any Simpsons fan or even just for someone who wants to be assured that their still is quality programming on television.,987638400,3,253,4.622222222222222
7887396,5,6305320136,"This is a must-have for any Simpsons fan, whether you've seen all the episodes and know these 6 show's production-codes, or you're seeing them for the first time. Season 3 is still the best season, because of episodes  like these. Tape One has ""Mr. Lisa Goes To Washington"", which is  a good episode anytime, and is even better here, un-syndicated. ""When  Flanders Failed"" is one of my favorites ever. ""Bart The  Murderer"", well, what can I say? It's a classic! ""Like Father,  Like Clown"" is okay, if sappy at times. ""Treehouse Of Horror  II"" is my favorite Halloween episode ever! ""Lisa's Pony"" is  a very funny episode too. Best to worst they are: 1. Bart The Murderer 2.  Treehouse Of Horror II 3. When Flanders Failed 4. Lisa's Pony 5. Mr. Lisa  Goes To Washington 6. Like Father, Like Clown
They're all funny though!",964828800,17,821,4.645833333333333

7887398,5,6305320136,"I live in England and am the best simpsons fan ever, and when I saw it in my local shop I had to buy it! The Tree House Of Horror II is great, what with the dreams and well Home he's a great ""Homer In A Box! ""  Mr. Lisa Goes To Wasington is great too...and I think that she's so cute! At  least Homers' not all bad in When Flanders Failed! But I felt I, really did  for Lisa in Lisa's Pony. And it proves that Homer is a GOOD LOVING FATHER!  Pooor Bart in Bart The Murder, the law is not a thing to play with!  We  find out about Krusty's father in Lake Father Like Clown!
