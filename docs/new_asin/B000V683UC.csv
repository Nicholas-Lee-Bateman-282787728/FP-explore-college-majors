I worked at Intel for a number of years, so I worked with many of the Intel staff portrayed in the documentary.  In fact, Stan Mazor was once my manager!  This is a very interesting and insightful look into what it was like during those times!",1404950400,2,470,5.0

This video tends to be a bit like watching paint dry, for me to get through this I am going to have to watch it in small doses over time. I would recommend it to Computer and Electronic Engineers or well versed enthusiasts as a history source, but not to those of us with limited knowledge in the field. I think that I was hoping it was something more along the lines of the Silicon Run Series, which I believe that I have seen one of in a college class. This video is strictly one on one interviews in cubicle/office type settings with the players recalling how things went down, that's it.",1262476800,2,688,4.3828125
