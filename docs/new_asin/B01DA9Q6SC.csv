7710012,4,B01DA9Q6SC,"For people curious as to what the  Grande Ballroom could be. It was a dancehall of sorts that was built in the 1920s that in 1966 Russ Gibb acquired. Now for people who are curious as to who Russ Gibb could be. He was the 5th member of the Bee Gees. I am joking, he was a schoolteacher by trade and he soon became interested in putting on dances for the teenagers in his area. The funny part, the people he would attract came from places that both music and dancing were prohibited. As time would go on, the music that the Grande would be known for was not ballroom at all. They would host people like The Who, Pink Floyd, MC5, Alice Cooper and etc. This was a place that would not cater to the flower power at the time. This was a place of aggression and self expression. The problem with this film like most rock documentaries these days, it does not have enough time to fully develop. Now, I will not say this film is bad, as I enjoyed it for the most part. This story is told thru the eyes of most of the people who either were a part by working or playing in the iconic place.

 This film also needed a light side, it just seems everyone is so serious like they are being probed by the FBI. This film also needed more flashback stuff and clips, it would have helped balance out the material. Again, this film was very good and I am such a sucker for every music documentary that is out there. If you are not familiar with the venue or most of the bands I mentioned in this review, this film could help you learn something new. It is very refreshing that more music documentaries are coming across more anti-commercial and goes for such a odd way of conveying  a story that it assumes people know what they are talking about, and not trying to dumb it down by over explaining it. There was not one minute of this documentary, that I felt weighed me down. I just wish it would have delved even further into the history and gave us more look backs at that era.

As a whole, in the decade we had documentaries like Downloaded that I feel is the greatest music documentary of the last half decade, this one is a good little time killer that you would enjoy for the most part. And if you are a music fan like I am, this is such a must watch at least one time.",1467849600,3,2258,4.157894736842105

7710020,5,B01DA9Q6SC,"The seeds planted by Bill Graham at the original Fillmore in San Francisco bloomed in many other cities, but few flowered as brightly as Detroits Grande Ballroom. Inspired by Russ Gibbs 1967 visit to the Fillmore, the Grande became a melting pot of flower power and urban grit, and a centerpiece of Detroits music and cultural scene. When Kiss sang Detroit Rock City, they were singing about the Grande. The citys industrial culture bred tough workers and industrial strength, no bulls*** rock n roll. Gibbs fortuitous connections to Detroits art scene and alternative community led to John Sinclair, and ultimately the MC5 and numerous other local luminaries. The Grandes imaginative booking policy turned the venue into what Don Was calls The Mecca of Hip, hosting local and national bands, and establishing itself as a lynchpin in the U.S. tour circuit of British acts.

The 74-minute documentary includes interviews with Gibb and Sinclair, ballroom manager Tom Wright, alternative publisher Harvey Ovshinsky, poster artist Gary Grimshaw, light show artist Chad Hines, and musicians Wayne Kramer and Dennis Thompson (MC5), Roger Daltrey (The Who), Scott Morgan (The Rationals), James Williamson (The Stooges), Dick Wagner (The Frost), Ted Nugent and more. A few of  the interview clips feel short, but there are many great stories, including that of the Whos first Grande gig. The Fillmore is rightly lauded for its seminal place in music history, but San Francisco and New York weren't the only happening spots. The Grande stands alongside Clevelands Agora, Chicagos Kinetic Playground, and San Franciscos Fillmore, Carousel, Matrix, Avalon and Winterland as one of rocks great halls, and Tony D'Annunzio and Karl Rauschs documentary tells its story grandly.

7710021,5,B01DA9Q6SC,Great! I grew up in Detwa during this era. I frequented all the venues including the Grande. What an era! Short lived and epic. Detroit was ground zero and ushered in music like we had never heard before.... or have since. 1969 was the apex.,1475884800,2,241,4.377777777777778

This ball room is where we went to hear the great bands. It was alot of fun. Many groups from england got their start their. Our michigan bands were excellent. I was a dj in detroit at that time,  and i loved the ballrooms. This dvd is the story of early rock music.",1530835200,,408,3.9156626506024095
8755326,1,B01DA9Q6SC,"You will notice that almost none of the ecstatic reviews here discuss what an original and well-researched documentary this is (it's not). Instead, they sigh their fond memories of going to the Grande Ballroom and enjoying the music of their youth. This confirms the axiom of Swami Otis that everyone thinks that the music which was popular when they were 18-to-25-years old was the greatest music ever made. This, of course, applies not just to the Detroit scene, but likewise at all times and everywhere, including those who dismissed Beethoven as noise, on past those who came of age in the '90s and still worship Radiohead, to the present and the youth who think that Post Malone is the greatest ever. But you don't even know who Post Malone is, because you're stuck in the past.

I suppose that a dump like the Grande deserves a shabby documentary such as this, because it was cheaply constructed and never a place of beauty such as the Vanity Ballroom on Detroit's East Side. Dearborn schoolteacher (and later right-wing radio blowhard) Russ Gibb had visited the Fillmore and Avalon ballrooms in San Francisco, and when he returned, he tried to duplicate the Summer of Love here on the cheap. The place always was an ugly dump, and despite that the posters advertised dance concerts, I never saw any dancing there, because Gibb regularly oversold the place, packing as many kids into to the firetrap as possible. We used to call it The Grande No-Ball-Room.

Despite making bushels of cash from the filthy hovel, Russ Gibb was too cheap to buy a decent PA system for the house. Examine any photos of The Five or Stooges or any other band on stage at the Grande, and you will have a difficult time finding the stage monitors. That's because there were no stage monitors. That's why Rob Tyner often sang with one finger in an ear  so he could hear himself. The vocals went through six Electro-Voice folded-horn speakers, such as used in a typical PA system in a factory or at a racetrack, and they sounded terrible.

From the entire '60s-Grande era, there are only about thirty seconds of silent footage of the MC5 performing on stage and nothing else. The repeated shot of Iggy shown in a crowd appears to be from the video of the Stooges performing at the Cincinnati Pop Festival. Other brief clips shown are of The Five at Belle Isle park, a concert which ended in mayhem when outlaw bikers arrived to terrorize the hippies. It seems that the producers of this documentary couldn't afford to buy the music rights, so you get to hear only brief snippets from the old albums you are already familiar with. Not having any concert footage means that the remaining 73 minutes consists of talking heads. Not the band of course, but head shots of anyone they could find who wanted attention and would talk about the Grande. They all have basically the same thing to say, and all of them are as boring as any other geezers rhapsodizing about the good ol' daze.

Except that many of the minor celebrities blathering on never set foot in the Grande. For example, Henry Rollins was six-years old and living at a prep school in Maryland when the Grande was in its heyday. Tom Morello was four and living in a suburb of Chicago. Slash (n Saul Hudson) was two and living in Stoke-on-Trent.

Likewise, (and I may be wrong here . . . though I doubt it) Alice Cooper raves about the Grande, but I don't think his band ever played there. The Alice Cooper band (from Los Angeles) splashed into the Detroit music scene when they opened for the Who in 1970 at the Rivera Theater, one block north of the Grande. There, during their number ""Science-Fiction Thriller,"" Alice and guitarist Glen Buxton began rolling car tires off the stage into the audience, and afterward, the whole city was abuzz, and the band was soon headlining, but not at the Grande. They regularly played at the Eastown, an old movie palace and a far superior venue.

Yes, there were some fine Michigan bands who played at the Grande, but also some awful ones. Once the Five and the Stooges and the Frost had albums out, they spent a lot of time touring. To replace them, Uncle Russ billed a band he was managing, The Sky. Remember The Sky? No? Well, there's a reason for that.

There were, however, some positive things about the Grande. For one, you could smoke dope there and nobody would hassle you. (At the Fillmore East several ushers would immediately pounce if anything was lit.) But at the Eastown, there was a beautiful young woman wearing a light-blue, fringed buckskin jacket and cowboy boots, standing in the lobby with a large Indian-style purse. From this purse, she sold weighed ounces of primo weed for $15-18. Blotter acid (LSD), quality stuff (at least 250mcg), sold for $5. The Eastown, under the management of Bob Bageris (later head of Bamboo Productions), was such a superior venue that people stopped going to the Grande. That's why it closed. A documentary about the Eastown would be far more worthwhile, but by 1970, the music explosion had reached the entire republic, and there was a Grande and an Eastown in every city.

This documentary's lame reminiscing is boring, and your interest in it is a symptom that you need to check yourself into a nursing home. Far better in every way is MC5: A True Testimonial by David Thomas and Laurel Legler, who spent their life savings and years of labor making a superb documentary about the MC5, which includes rare footage (obtained from the FBI) of the band bravely playing in Grant Park at the Chicago Convention protests of 1968. The Five were a great band but not the smartest of guys, so Wayne Kramer sued Thomas and Legler over the music rights to the movie, and it was thus never released, except as a bootleg, so everyone lost. But if you search around, YOU mighT BE able to view it.

One Detroit scene which has never been documented at all is the hippie commune at Grayhaven, the Gar Wood mansion on the Detroit River. Teenaged nubiles and nymphets would flock to Detroit from the Grosse Pointes, St. Clair Shores and points north, drop acid and get naked with the groovy vibes of the house band, Stonefront (who did not sound Detroit at all but more like Santana). The Grande was for rebellious blue-collar kids from Lincoln Park, while the Gar Wood mansion was for spiritual rich kids practicing Tantric yoga.

The majority of people involved in these scenes left Detroit long ago or else they've died. The only two left alive in Greater Detroit are me and Dennis Thompson, the drummer of the MC5.",1516665600,3,6533,4.662326388888889
8755327,4,B01DA9Q6SC,"Rock and roll has gone through so many stages in such a short time. Where performers once toured the country playing at American Legion halls and high school gymnasiums they now play to arenas. When it began you had a touring band and a few spotlights, now we have laser shows, flame throwers and big screen TVs. The one thing that has fallen short though is music. Music was once played by actual performers in the bands you went to see. Those have been replaced with vocal tracks and recorded music. Ah there was a time

Most people have heard about the Fillmore, east AND west, that founder Bill Graham turned into the mecca for rock fans of the sixties. But how many are aware of The Grande Ballroom?

LOUDER THAN LOVE tells the story of The Grande Ballroom. Founded in 1966 by teacher and part time DJ Russ Gibb it was inspired by a trip he made to San Francisco to that legendary Fillmore Theater. Inspired he wondered why something like that hadnt been tried in Detroit where he lived. Taking on the task he opened the venue at the perfect time since the Detroit area was blooming with some of the hottest up and coming performers of the time.

The movie tells the story using a combination of stills and interviews with a ton of celebrities who played there over the years. All thats missing is actual footage of the locale, missing Im guessing because none exists. Thats quite sad learning its history. Sadder still is to get a glimpse of what the once well know location has become, a shell of itself and now in ruins. Why some historical society has failed to take on this building as a project is a shame. Then again with so little money in the coffers of Detroit that may be why.

The venue was noted for being the birthplace of MC5, one of the most influential bands of the time. Their live album was recorded there. As a matter of fact they were one of the house bands as well as The Stooges. Other groups to perform their included Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin, Pink Floyd, The Grateful Dead, Cream, Procol Harum and The Who.

A number of those who performed there are included in interviews in this film, a loving tribute to the venue. Included among those are Wayne Kramer, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Mark Farner, B.B. King, Henry Rollins, Tom Morello and Lemmy.

The Grande Ballroom was a celebration of live music, the shows that were performed by the actual musicians to raving fans of the time. The movie pays tribute to the good times had by all there. In the end it makes you long for the days of live music, when seeing a band meant actually seeing the band, when music was what mattered rather than the spectacle its become. If you missed out on it give this movie a look and realize what once was and is now sorely missing. While watching youll find yourself wanting to pull out those old albums to listen to and take the time to KICK OUT THE JAMS!",1508716800,,2871,4.428030303030303

If you are from the Detroit area, you will absolutely love this; if you aren't from the Detroit area, you will wish you were.  I was about 5 years too young to go the Grande Ballroom, but I had heard so much about it.  I so envy the kids who were old enough to enjoy the whole Grande Ballroom experience.
