8533502,5,B0090SKUS0,"I love Turma da Monica, they have really good cartoons for kids. I bought it because I wanted my nephew to learn Portuguese and it is a Brazilian cartoon. I think there's an option to watch it in English too, but it was not my intention and I did not even look for it. I watched all the cartoons with my boyfriend before and it was really fun! I definitely recommend it! I think there are 10 mini stories of 10 min each.
I will probably buy the Best Moments of Cebolinha soon.",1378944000,,476,4.129032258064516
