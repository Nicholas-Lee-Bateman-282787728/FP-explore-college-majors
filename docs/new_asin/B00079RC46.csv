8046278,3,B00079RC46,"Given the praise I'd read about this film, I was somewhat disappointed by the low production values and the talky and not very dramatic plot. It's ""based"" on ""Fishke the Lame"" [Fiske der krumer] by the classic Yiddish novelist Abramovitch, who is known under his pseudonym of ""Mendele Moykher Seforim"" (Mendele the Book-peddlar). The original is much more satirical than this film, very loosely based on one episode of the book, and highly sentimentalized. The upside is the excellent performances of the protagonists, and the film's historical importance. However, for sheer entertainment, such Yiddish films as ""Tevye,"" ""Green Fields [Grine Felder]}, and ""Yidl mitn fidl"" [with the great Molly Picon, z""l""], provide much better value.",1190764800,5,736,5.408695652173913
