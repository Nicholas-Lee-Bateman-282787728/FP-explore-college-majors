8131080,3,B000GETTPC,"This was my first exposure to slide guitar instruction other than Youtube. I found it helpful, but only for getting started. Because I've been playing guitar for a while, I had hoped for something that would provide more material to play. With this dvd, you learn the basic mechanics of slide including vibrato, a few scales, and a few licks. A lot of info that most more advanced players won't need or want, including how to read notes and tab. You aren't going to get much more than the basics. If you are just want to get started, this will help. If you are hoping to start playing blues slide or something else, look elsewhere.",1189900800,4,631,4.495652173913044
