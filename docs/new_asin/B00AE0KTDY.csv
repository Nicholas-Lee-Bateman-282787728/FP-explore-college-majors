Thus, please look at a little information about what happened at Fukushima. Also, if you can, please find information about atomic bombs. We, Japanese always remember about Hiroshima's atomic bombs whenever we hear nuclear. However, when Fukushima nuclear energy factory burned, Japanese government said its safe, but we began noticing that's used as the same material as atomic bombs. And, all we are scared about it. This movie can inspire to most people to think about nuclear energy.",1413072000,,607,5.141414141414141

The great inspiration for this movie is obviously Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalker/dp/B000I8OOG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalker</a>&nbsp;But where Tarkovsky's movies can be really poignant, this movie is just nothing. It's a great mistake that it was ever made. A filmic language which was maybe relevant in 1979, can loose all relevance in 2012. This movie is an epitome of how stupid the people, who are handing out support money, to ""artistic"" movies, really are. Don't watch it, you'll be bored and regret it.",1379203200,,756,5.81981981981982
