1883752,5,B00009KNWZ,When I started to watch Love on the Land I remembered I had seen it but forgot most of it so am glad I ordered it and enjoyed it again,1373500800,,134,3.5
1883753,5,B00009KNWZ,"I bought this movie for my mother and she absolutley loves it!  She saw the movie originally on TV years ago and told me how much she would love to see it again, and now because of Amazon(thanks!!!) I made it happpen.  I'm thrilled that I could bring joy to my mother and put a huge smile on her face, she needed it:)",1349913600,7,317,4.015873015873016
1883754,5,B00009KNWZ,"My mom watched this a least 5 times while she stayed over my house for a few days. If you knew my mom you would know this is not her normal behavior. I had a feeling she would like it, but I didn't think she would ask to watch it this much. I really liked it too. I thought the acting was perfect. I loved the scenery and music in the start of the film. Yes it is not Green Gables but it never claimed to be. If you look on the cover you can figure that out.",1334793600,4,458,3.683673469387755
1883755,5,B00009KNWZ,This is a very good movie and I will watch it again. I reccomend this one to anyone that likes family movies,1258934400,8,108,3.9545454545454546
1883756,1,B00009KNWZ,"I purchased this movie because the producers are the same as Anne of Green Gables. I thought since it had the same producers it would be just as good or close. How wrong could I have been! I had to stop it after about 40 minutes because of the numerous bedroom scenes and an inappropriate and embarrassing remark made by Peter Strauss making reference to his wife's body. If you are concerned about the kind of movies your family watches, do not waste your money on this movie. Our copy went in the trash.",1203984000,25,505,4.382978723404255
1883757,5,B00009KNWZ,"A good adaptation of the original book written by George Dell, called ""The Earth Abideth.""  Life's lessons are scattered throughout the film.  Considering the story was written in the early 20th century, it proves history repeats itself many times over!  I wish the film would have made it past a once-broadcast mini-series though, as this is a sleeper of a story.",1195776000,2,364,4.934426229508197
1883758,5,B00009KNWZ,I have wanted to own this movie for years and finaly found it here!! Anyone who loves a good story should see this great movie!!,1188259200,15,128,4.16
1883759,4,B00009KNWZ,"Peter Strauss stars as a man who works a farm after the Civil War, with his wife (played by Rachel Ward). Love on the Land shows a fairly accurate portrayal of a family settling land and their trials during Westward Expansion.",1115510400,4,226,4.536585365853658

7991141,5,B00009KNWZ,A wonderful story with fine actors.  The story of a Canadian Pioneer family and their trials and tribulations.  You don't want to miss this one!,1447632000,,144,4.72
7991142,4,B00009KNWZ,"The 2 leads--Peter Strauss and Rachel Ward (in their early 50s) carry this tv movie with amazing chemistry (as one other person noted, Rachel Ward had more chemistry with Peter Strauss than she did with Richard Chamberlain in The Thorn Birds).  The best scenes are when it's just the 2 of them, esp in their last scene together.  Plot is based on the book by George Dell  ""The Earth Abideth.""  Very good production value, and the scenery and staging are impressive. The story revolves around mistakes that the ambitious lead character makes, and the consequences on his family.  The ending may not be acceptable to everyone and may seem cold/abrupt, but part of the theme is that not every character can forgive, esp. when the scars run deep or when forgiveness is sought too late.  Btw--no subtitles, no extra features, otherwise would have gotten 5 stars.",1437696000,3,857,4.835616438356165

7991147,5,B00009KNWZ,"Ever since seeing 'Kane and Abel', I bought every DVD of Peter Strauss that I could obtain such as 'Rch Man Poor Man', 'Masada' and 'Love on the Land'. I was not disappointed. Here too it is Peter Strauss' intense acting that make the film very special. I recommend it.
