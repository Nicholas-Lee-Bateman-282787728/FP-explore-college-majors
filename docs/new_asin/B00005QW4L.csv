1651840,5,B00005QW4L,"Released in the UK as ""Second World War in Colour, the British Story"". It is by the same people who did ""Second World War in Colour"" (in the UK) which was released in the States as ""World War II the Lost Color Archive"". It follows the same format as the earlier title: John Thaw narrates as others read letters, diaries, etc, as the images go by. There is no studio filler, just original color footage from the war (and some before). In three parts ""Darkest Hour"", ""Beginning of the End"", and ""Unknown Warriors"" (which also shows some of the people as they are today). I don't think this is quite as good as the original- which I reviewed as ""the best documentary I've seen""- it is still excellent. The DVD also includes Wyler's original ""Memphis Belle"" and some footage not shown in the UK broadcast. These are not on the VHS release",1013990400,37,834,4.493421052631579

1651846,3,B00005QW4L,"If you're looking for the WW2 in Color series that ran on the Military Channel (Now AHC Channel)... the name of the production company that did them is World Media Rights. They have a website under the same name. On that site, that series and the other series they've produced, are at least available for download. But it doesn't appear that they offer DVDs. Maybe if enough people ask, they will get some made up.",1439683200,4,414,4.533333333333333
1651847,3,B00005QW4L,"I'd like to add my own expression of frustration to the comments here who have mentioned that they were disappointed that this is not the ""other"" WW II in Color they were seeking by the same name.  The jewel box picture of the series I refer to displays a profile of an American marine on the beach of, one assumes, one of the Pacific islands.

More information: What I, and a few others posting here are seeking, consists of a three disc set, released in 2009, narrated by Robert Powell. Disc One has four parts: ""The Gathering Storm"", ""Lightening War"", ""Britain at Bay"" and ""Hitler Strikes East"".  Disc 2 has parts labeled: ""Red Sun Rampant"", ""The Mediterranean & North Africa"", ""Turning the Tide"", and ""The Soviet Steamroller"", and Disc Three, Overlord, Closing the Ring, The Island War, Victory in Europe, and Victory in the Pacific.  I cannot find another copy of this wonderful series ANYWHERE Ive looked.  The reason I assume this series was released in the U.S. (and not just in the U.K.) is that I was fortunate to find a copy in the discount bin of a Best Buy store!

A truly first-rate production, consisting of excellent narration and script writing, and a wonderful selection of colorized film segments, the 3 disc boxed Brit production series covers both the European and Pacific theaters.  The series here, (with Hellcats flying in formation and a burning carrier displayed on the jewel case), to which most of the postings here rightfully comment on, focuses on the air war, contemporaneous period news, Hollywood-released movie segments, and other widely available color film clips we've all seen in many other series. It is a worthwhile purchase and a good production, given its limited scope, but it's not nearly as thorough, the treatment not as comprehensive or visually interesting, nor is it as well dramatized as the WW II in Color British production narrated by Robert Powell.

I realize this is not so much a critique of the series here as it is an appeal to you WW II history enthusiasts to leave a brief post if or when you come across this outstanding British production by the same name.  Thanks for your patience!",1436918400,11,2144,4.788617886178862

1651893,4,B00005QW4L,"Despite the same name, this is not the WWII in Color that was shown on the Military Channel. So we'll get that out of the way first. Most, if not all, of these films are public domain films shot during WWII, put together in a convenient package. The print quality is good for the most part. There is one bad skip in the middle of The Fighting Lady and a few skips in some of the other films. But The Fighting Lady one is pretty bad and I don't think it's just my disc. For that reason, I have a skip-free version which can be downloaded at archive.org.

The Memphis Belle is one I bought on VHS and have watched many times over the years. The rest are new to me and mostly pretty entertaining. A lot of the stock footage you see in other documentaries came from these films.

1651894,5,B00005QW4L,"This film collection shows, in vivid colors, the details of many operations that happenned during WWII, as seen by the protagonists.
The filming was done, in many scenes, at the soldier level. It shows details about the actual combat operations we normally can only imagine.
Very revealing.
To view these scenes is a tribute both to the men that filmed then, at their own risk, and to the men that fought the WWII.

1651895,3,B00005QW4L,"I'm pretty unknowledgeable about ww1 and ww2, so can't compare this, my 2nd disc set of WW2 events, to any others.  My main problem is with the censorship.  First, if I buy an already ""warning, explicit, disturbing images"" DVD, I don't want any censorship, by this I mean the blurring out of women's breasts, or infants' genetalia, both of which are present in this DVD.  In one scene the ""Gala Girls"" in a ruined pre-ww2 Berlin cabaret are swinging, topless, from a chandelier, with their breasts blurred out.  Later scenes are full of body parts, bulldozing dead bodies into ditches, pistol assassinations, etc.  I truly don't understand a society that thinks a woman's breast should be covered but a decapitation is OK.  If you're going to censor, just don't print/film/distribute.  Why is a woman's nudity, or a toddler's genetalia, considered ""unviewable"", while  murder, torture, etc. is so explicitly displayed?  I'm leaving this review open to receive by email others' comments, I'd really like to hear what supports this thought process, what other thoughts are out there.

As well as I know the events of WW2, I think this is a good rendering/documentary. The HD is good. The narration is clear, the background music doesn't overwhelm,as it does in the Rise and Fall,  and it seems pretty comprehensive, as least as any 5hr hour dvd, on a 5-10yr event, can be, to me.  I would give the DVD 4 stars  if it weren't for the censorship.",1309996800,,1442,4.836734693877551
1651896,5,B00005QW4L,It's a great box set for the price but it's a shame they don't clean them up as the first episode is in pretty poor condition and with today's tech it would be worth the trouble. It gives you a great insight at how it was back in the early 1940s through the eyes of people who were there. Anyone interested in what it was like for the people who lived it should consider buying this box set. I would recommend it. I just hope they clean it up one day.,1307318400,,451,3.967032967032967

1651903,5,B00005QW4L,"The previous contributors have done a great job reviewing this DVD set. All I want to add is that these remarkable films were shot on original Kodak color filmstock of the era and were directed by such Hollywood legends as Ford, Houston and Wyler who, by the way, put themselves in considerable personal danger to supervise the filming. Such was their deep respect and admiration for the very young men, boys really, who put their lives on the line to stand up to the madness of Nazi Germany and Imperialist Japan that they volunteered to lend their years of experience to document the world changing, life changing events unfolding before them.",1266710400,23,645,4.81981981981982
1651904,5,B00005QW4L,"I really enjoyed these color films of WWII from the Timeless Media Group.

Among those included that really stand out:

The Memphis Belle (Famous B-17 Bomber, European Theater)
The Fighting Lady (aircraft carrier footage, pacific theater)
Eyewitness to war (color footage, from a war correspondent, European theater)

The other included films are also good. The three above alone are worth the price of this set.

You should note that this is not a ""definitive collection"" of color video from WWII. Nor does it cover the entire war.  Still, it offers a color glimpse into a history so often portrayed in Black and White.  In color, the images are more real, the violence and destruction more real...something that should not be trivialized.

You won't regret this purchase.",1265414400,13,773,5.087301587301587
1651905,1,B00005QW4L,"World War 2 in Color - The British Story is an enormous disappointment simply because it lacks the narration by John Thaw as advertised on Amazon's website and also on the DVD sleeve notes. In fact it lacks any kind of narration at all and while the pictures are fascinating and good quality they are virtually meaningless without an explanatory narrative.
I've got a copy of this programme on VHS so am able to make an accurate comparison. The video is identical to the VHS but the audio is missing from the DVD. It's therefore not the same product.

It's possibly significant that the DVD which I have received has a completely different cover to that shown on this review page and I believe Amazon should have a good look at this as they are clearly selling a product which is not exactly as advertised.

Summing up I'd say 'Buyer beware'. Without the narrative the DVD is as good as useless.

Sincerely,

Ken Taylor.",1237420800,3,920,4.591463414634147
1651906,5,B00005QW4L,"I purchased this box set when I was looking for color footage of WW II. However, when I got it in the mail, it turned out that these were documentaries made in the 1940s and most of them were shown in movie theaters as a tribute to the American troops fighting oversees and to get more people to enlist. When I learned of this, I was a little disappointed. After all, how good could 65 year old documentaries be, compared to the recent ones they show on the History Channel or National Geographic? The answer is: VERY. I own a lot of DVDs wth color footage of the Second World War but ""World War II in Color"" is by far the best of them all. Almost all of the action images of Allied fighter planes and bombers taking on Axis aircraft that you see in the History Channel's excellent ""the Lost Color Archives"" series are taken from the films you'll find on these discs. Most of the other color documentaries I've seen show amateur pictures taken by army officers or civilians that shot street images of marching soldiers, occupied cities or the ruined landscape and towns after the actual combat. Not so in this two disc box set. These pictures were shot by professional filmmakers who more often than not had earned their stripes in Hollywood or have had succesful careers in the movie industry after the war. The result of the life threatening risks they took to film this extrordinay footage is absolutely amazing.

John Ford's ""The Battle of Midway"" tells the story of one of the greatest sea battles in history. You see battle ships and allied fighters defend themselves against the relentless Japanese kamikaze attacks. Although this is my least favorite documentary, due to the rather silly sense of humour that is sometimes present, it does provide us with plenty of breathtaking color images of the courageaous American fighter pilots in their quest to gain control over the Pacific.

""The Memphis Belle"" is my absolute favorite WW II documentary. It tells the story of an Allied bomber making its 25th and final flight across the English channel to wreak havoc on the German industry. We are shown how the pilots are debriefed: what flight formation they need to maintain, what their targets are, etc. We are introduced to the crew and are shown what it was like for these men to travel to enemy soil and how a bombing actually takes place. We witness some awesome aerial images of an entire fleet of Allied fighters and bombers, see the gunners fight off Nazi airplanes and the downfall of one of their own bombers, all while we are privy to internal radio communication over the intercom. The tension and anxiety is clearly present in the crew's voices but they still keep their head cool and get on with their jobs under life threatening circumstances. Afterwards we see the often damaged bombers return to English soil and witness the terrible images of men wounded in aerial combat and having their often crippled bodies taken care of by the medics.

""Report from the Aleutians"" shows American forces fighting just as hard against nature as against the enemy. You see Allied fighters take of under the most dire circumstances and try to land wounded planes after the fight. This documentary may not feature the most impressive fighting images, but it does give us a good idea of what men had to endure on an island which has no peace time value whatsoever, since its harsh climate is unable to sustain human life, but wich became invaluable in wartime because of its strategic location. At the start of the War in the Pacific, this was as close as the Americans could get to Japan's home islands.

""Eyewitness to War"" shows us who the brave men were who shot the images we see in World War II documentaries. This was actually a series of images shot and commented on by a professional film maker, hired by the US Army to shoot black and white pictures of the events from the Normandy landing to the fall of Berlin, so the military leaders could study their own tactics and improve them for future battles. The color footage you see was shot by the fillm maker with his own camera so he could show his family and friends back home what he witnessed in occupied Europe. We see images of the citizins of London who try to lead normal lives during the nightly bombings that occured every day, the boarding of ships and landing vessels bound for France, the Normandy landings and the soldiers' daily routines while fighting their way to Berlin with mention of the people in the film who did not make it back.

""The Fighting Lady"" is a military documentary about airplane carriers during the War in the Pacific. We are introduced to the crew and get detailed information about the carriers themselves and what it was like to live inside them. There's a lot of footage of fighters taking off from the carriers and wounded ones trying to make it back. Some do and some don't, which provide spectacular pictures. There are also a lot of images shot by cameras that are mounted on the fighters' guns so we get a good idea of what it was like to engage enemy fighters and strafe Japanese airfields, with detailed explanation of what exactly is taking place.

""The 6th Marines at Okinawa"" is a documentary about the capture of this Japanese island. Besides impressive jungle warfare images, it contains footage of the interrogation of POWs and striking pictures of an enemy soldier who has had to amputate his own leg to survive.

""The Last Bomb"" tells of the fight of the American forces against the Japanese home islands. The documentary contains fascinating footage of dog fights with enemy planes, the bombing of Japan, some beautiful close-up shots of the P51 Mustangs and the B29 bombers in action and the drop of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

In my opninion, this is a must have DVD box set for all World War II buffs. Especially if you like action shots of period American military aircraft, war ships, aiplane carriers, jeeps, tanks, halftracks and army trucks, you will not be disappointed.",1212364800,128,6016,4.684957426679281

1651909,2,B00005QW4L,"The actual content of this Video/DVD is very good - as is the majority of the quality of the photography.

However, while the title is 'The British Story', this is only partly true - and, then, only in the beginning. The final 85 minutes, or so, is devoted to the last bombing raid of the Memphis Belle - in itself a marvelous, interesting, and thoroughly praiseworthy incident in the war. But, except that the planes engaged in the raid took off and landed in the UK, there is nothing whatsoever British' about this memorable incident. Before this, about 50 minutes are takekn up with various photographic shots of Britian taken during the war - however, with absolutely no commentary, there was no sense or reason for this 'Tourist' advertisement! Another grating point was that too few 'witnesses' were interviewed, resulting in only a relative few people telling their stories - over and over - in different ways and in different sections of the video/DVD.

The first couple of Sections were fair enough - although a lack of cohesion was caused by incidents and happenings being 'reported' out of sequence. The impression was given (although admittedly not said) that the US Forces were in the UK almost from the outset. Of course, they weren't! Far too little importance was given to the (literally) vital North Atlantic theatre of war. NO OTHER THEATRE HAD THE ABILITY TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE UK - and the eventual outcome of the war. Even the 'Battle of Britain' would have proved unimportant, had the Germans severed the life line of ships and their cargoes of food, war supplies and later personnel, from the USA and Canada.

The covering of the North African Campaign was badly portrayed. El Alamein is only touched upon, whereas the joint landings of operation 'Torch' were dwelled upon. 'Torch' was a third class 'show' in Africa, and had far too many set-backs. In and of itself, it barely constituted a success. (Lessons, however, were learned by 'Torch' and the Americans gained vital fighting experience).  El Alamein was THE battle in N. Africa and the reason Rommel was thrown out of Africa. Finally, the landings in the South of France were shown as being important. This was rubbish. These landings were virtually unopposed - and barely necessary.

In truth, the title 'The British Story' is very misleading and - as far as half the video/DVD is concerned - totally inaccurate.

The Video/DVD would have scored 3 stars, in my opinion, IF it had covered the V-weapon bombardment of London and the South East area (mainly) of England. This V-weapon bombardment caused as much if not more damage to London and the citizenry, than the original 'Blitz'. It was a huge and important 'incident' in the long war - yet it was  totally ignored!!! This, in itself, was highly opprobririous.",1108252800,22,2801,4.847280334728033
7951186,5,B00005QW4L,"These films were made by the Five Directors who went on to Hollywood fame. As military cameramen, they recorded the action, then, as editor/directors, they made the films. It's is all wartime propaganda, but it is the sort of wartime propaganda that is absolutely necessary--a free people helping themselves remember who they are and what they stand for. Watch these films from the point of view of a public feeling legitimate fears that the Axis could win the war and subjugate its conquests. You'll then get a sense of how welcome such stuff was.",1516060800,,548,4.840425531914893

7951191,3,B00005QW4L,"Disappointed.  Much of it was shot by a 16 mm camera, so the quality stinks. Not much color saturation, and the video is blurred. The voiceover is good. I own the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, all of it shot by amateurs. The quality of the German film is far superior. This film does depict real people who fought in WWII, not fake Hollywood actors who never saw service. The action shown is real, however I would watch this film only once.",1472515200,,444,4.285714285714286
