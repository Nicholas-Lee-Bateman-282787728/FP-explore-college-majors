It's a delightful picture from the genius, Federico Fellini.  The film, which won an Academy Award, traces the life of a young man growing up near Rimini (Fellini's city) before World War II.  I want to see it again!",1442534400,,337,4.491803278688525
8174324,4,B000N33OSY,"I love Amarcord, for reasons given by other reviewers, but this particular Korean edition is terrible. I have seen the movie twice before, and many of the scenes that were most memorable have been edited out or shortened!  How could they do this! Most of the scenes that were imprinted in my memory most vividly are missing! Even the wonderful end, with the camera moving slowly away from the last scene, was cut.  This is a cinematic crime!  Also, my copy did not have Italian dialogue as advertised, but only English with English subtitles.  The subtitles were not the same as the English dialogue--they were awful!  Don't buy this Korean fake!!!",1262131200,3,648,4.801801801801802
8174325,5,B000N33OSY,"Fellini's Amarcord is one of those films that exist outside of many of the stereotypes of modern film-making. The director's representation of his own provincial youth is touching and melancholic, not unlike the impeccable score composed by Nino Rota for this film.
Each character takes on the epic and iconic dimensions well known of small-town living, where every crush becomes an obsession and every story becomes a legend.
Fellini achieves a spectacular feat of film-making in captivating the viewer even without a plot. This film is really to be considered as a series of ""tableux"" of rural Italy in the late 30's.
A gem of art-house film-making.",1247788800,2,651,5.093457943925234
8174326,1,B000N33OSY,"I think the people who don't like my review of this movie are the ones selling this video!  Like an early 80's film that ""dared to be sexual,"" the movie is childish, and dumb.  I can't believe they found a critic who liked it.  I buy and watch a lot of foreign films, but I threw this one away.  If you're spending your precious dollars on your movie collection, buy something else!",1237507200,,382,4.263888888888889
8174327,5,B000N33OSY,"Most of you looking at this page know about this great film so I am just going to comment on this specific dvd release from Cine Korea. Just as the Criterion release is NOT Anamorphic widescreen, neither is this version contrary to what the description says. That being said, the transfer is almost identical to the original Criterion release, but the new Criterion transfer is much better. If you really love the film, spend a couple extra bucks on the new Criterion re-release.",1172534400,12,479,4.783132530120482
