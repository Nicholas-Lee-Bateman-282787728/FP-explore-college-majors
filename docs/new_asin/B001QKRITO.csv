8335957,5,B001QKRITO,"Dorbees has changed my life.

Since watching it for the first time it has had a major impact on how I perceive the world and make decisions. It has taught me the importance of being honest, kind, considerate, forgiving, and being a person of integrity. I have adopted the groundbreaking philosophical and theological ideas found in this film into my daily life, and have been able to hold incredibly deep conversations with friends colleagues on the implications of the moral principles presented in the film. It is truly a revolutionary piece of cinema.

I would highly recommend anyone who considers themselves an intellectual to conisider watching Dorbees as soon as physically possible.",1512432000,,690,5.151785714285714

8335961,5,B001QKRITO,"Avant-garde CGI, world-class soundtrack composition, impeccable voice acting, and ethereally good storytelling pervade this masterpiece of modern cinema.

This incredible tale of microscopic balls at once evokes mankind's oldest existential riddles yet at the same time presents a coming-of-age romp through pre-adolesence. Expertly done graphics breathe life into the Dorbees in a way I couldn't have possibly imagined, especially the obvious passion expressed by the artists when creating the Dorbees' very lifelike eyes.

An added bonus is that this available on VHS, a true workhorse format of home entertainment that has yet to be surpassed by any of this flash-in-the-pan DVD or Blu-Ray crap.",1453420800,9,698,5.701923076923077
8335962,5,B001QKRITO,"Okay, so when I saw this come on this morning (on KTV) I started to change the channel. The computer animation was so much more basic than what I have gotten spoiled to with Disney/Pixar movies that I thought it was just something someone had thrown together to fill up air time. I watched very cynically for a minute thinking the dialogue would be as stiff as the animation, and was blown away. It reminds me of something that would go completely viral on the internet. It has the randomness of Charlie the Unicorn YouTube videos with the sweet poiniance masked in humor of a Veggie Tales episode. LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!",1275955200,,617,4.517857142857143
