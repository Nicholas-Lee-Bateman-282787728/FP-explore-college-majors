3159108,4,B0016MJ6I8,"In ""Shotgun Stories"", writer/director Jeff Nichols places a story of resentment and revenge in rural Arkansas. Three close-knit brothers attend the funeral of their father, who had stopped drinking, become religious, and started a new family after years of abusing his first family. The eldest brother, simply named Son (Michael Shannon), lets loose his hatred for his father at the funeral, setting off a feud with the four sons of his father's second family. Middle brother Boy (Douglas Ligon) is trepidatious about the escalating violence. Youngest brother Kid (Barlow Jacobs) is affable but intensely loyal. When the eldest of the second family's sons, Cleaman (Michael Abbott, Jr.), tries to head off the conflict, Son just can't let go of his bitterness and shame.

A feud unfolds slowly and quietly in America's heartland. The brothers' mounting anger explodes in violence against an eerily uneventful background. There is a very nice score written in part by the director's brother Ben Nichols, which is used sparingly, allowing the isolated and measured quality of life to sink in. The success of this film is due to that tone, which the actors uphold admirably with unsentimental and unself-conscious performances. The feud results partly because some of the brothers are more like their father than they would like to admit, but perhaps even more because they have nothing to do. There is little distraction from the past's sins and the present anger. Films of family feuds are hardly new, but ""Shotgun Stories"" strikes an interesting note.

The DVD (Liberation 2008): Bonus features include a Photo Gallery with a slide show of production stills, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and 2 audio options for viewing the film. You have the option of watching or listening to the film with only the music sound track, no dialogue or other sounds. There is definitely some good music in ""Shotgun Stories"", but it's too intermittent to make this option practical. There is also a fairly constant audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols, in which he talks about filming in Arkansas, casting, the actors, the locations, cinematography, story, and his inspirations for various aspects of the film. No subtitles.",1215302400,2,2218,5.192737430167598
3159109,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Indie Wire has been all abuzz with recent comments by former Miramax president Mark Gill that the ""Sky is falling"" on the American Indie film scene. ""Shotgun Stories"" offers evidence to the contrary. It's a real film, with real human emotion, with believable characters, story and setting. Nothing rings false. That is so monumentally rare in global cinema that it makes me proud that the film is American. And this is no flag-waiver fare. As a matter of fact it is politically opinionless. The concerns of a small inter-familial war can most definitely be symbolic of certain recent larger conflicts, but only on a universal level, in that all violence escalates from a certain point, and that start when viewed in hindsight is usually petty, but the damage unrepairable.
The camera work is marvelous, the cast led by Michael Shannon is impeccable, and film is quietly moving. It's a true throwback to the maverick 1970s. The DVD even has the Lucero score on an isolated track, which I've let run in the background a few times while tending to household chores. I didn't get to catch this in theaters, and I really wish I had. Thank god for DVD.",1214870400,12,1146,4.763819095477387
3159110,4,B0016MJ6I8,"First-time director Jeff Nichols managed to create this amazing minimalist film on a shoestring budget. I was impressed with how so much was told but at times hardly anything was happening. A worthy independent with a big-budget production feel to it.

The cast was all recruited from nearby regions, including Michael Shannon, who gave a stellar performance as the lead brother. He is one of those actors where so much is said just by their minimal facial expressions. There are only a couple of familiar faces in the cast, otherwise this was an independent film all the way, but you would not know with the excellent acting by everyone.

The film takes place (and is filmed) in Arkansas, including areas in and around Keo, England and Little Rock. My HD comment goes to the massive amounts of landscapes and topography that are shown throughout the film. The widescreen ratio beautifully displayed rural Arkansas farms, sunsets, and small town decay; the best I have see in a southern movie in years. I would love to see this artwork in Blu.

The story is about three brothers living a simple existence, two work at a fish farm while the third moonlights as part-time teacher. Their bland lives are scattered with normal wants, including one who wants to get married, another wants to maintain a relationship with his son while dealing with his gambling and familial separations, and the last brother just ekes out a living from his van while coaching middle school kids in basketball. Their lives are shattered with violence when their estranged father dies and they decide to attend his funeral. A feud erupts between the dad's newer family and theirs as they all try to cope with their spite and hatred of each other.

The story develops slowly but it reflects the pace of life there so eloquently. The script and scenes seemed so accurate of that lifestyle, including a sequence where the main characters run an extension cord into their home's backyard, connect it to an residential AC unit and set it on a picnic bench to keep cool while drinking beer. In another scene the van brother runs a hot-wired cord from his vehicle's motor to a blender so he can make drinks. Lots of these local subtleties that make for a worthwhile film that deserves to be seen. The soundtrack has some great cuts of local bands and is scored with a beautiful sounding instrument that is described in the commentary.

The DVD has a brief photo mantage, a director's commentary, and a music only track of the film. SPOILER: The artwork on the front of the DVD should be ignored as it contradicts the whole sequence of the film (the dog being in that shotgun scene).

This will be on my recommendation list, but judging from the theatrical release spread (2 screens) and no advertising budget, I am afraid it will get overlooked.",1214697600,16,2814,4.756147540983607

3159112,5,B0016MJ6I8,"I just returned from Ebertfest.  Shotgun stories was my second favorite film, with first place going to von Sternberg's silent classic, Underworld.  With an academy-award winning script by Ben Hecht and superb acting from Clive Brook, Evelyn Brent and George Bancroft this is, to say the least, stiff competition.  Shotgun Stories is a small movie by a first-time director working on a small budget.  Nevertheless, it is a superb piece of work.  Set in Arkansas it is the story of a feud between two families who share a common father.  The director is Jeff Nichols.  Remember that name; you will be hearing it again and again.  This little film, which Nichols also wrote, is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and fully realized.  I would not change a word or a moment of screen time.  Michael Shannon's acting is particularly memorable, but every member of the cast is excellent.  The plot is starkly simple.  A man dies.  The children from his first marriage come to the funeral, where the man is mourned by the wife and children of his second family.  One speaks briefly and then spits on his coffin.  An old feud is rekindled.  Violence follows, violence that is, ultimately, muted by the deep but barely-stated emotions of the brothers from the first family and the women who love them.  That is all and it is utter magic.",1209340800,5,1330,4.788546255506608

Protaganist/Antagonist roles are blurry here. Regrettable actions are shared across the board. But the emphasis on family, relationships, and shared heritage when you've got nothing else take the center stage. It's clear in this early work of Jeff Nichols the how the DNA of his thoughtful portrayal of ""Loving"" came to be.

The setting is simple but the themes are of Shakesperian and even Biblical proportions. This movie is also a horror film, in a way, because it shows how the selfish acts of one generation bleeds into the next until you have hate and murder and death. In this case, the father of both sets of brothers was a pig to leave his wife and not take care of his original sons, his new wife never should have married him and let him ignore his children and his ex-wife shouldn't have filled her sons with hate for the younger Hayes boys.

3159146,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Not Actually About Shotguns, Turns Out

Shotgun Stories takes a while to bust out the shotguns, and I'll admit I was feeling a little itchy waiting.

I'll save you the trouble of wondering: it was worth it.

The indie-drama falls decidedly into the tragedy category and focuses on a blood-feud which spirals toward the clash of two sets of half-brothers. Son, played by the underrated Michael Shannon, and his younger brothers, Boy and Kid, were abandoned by their drunken father early in life. After the separation, their father went on to sober up, find Jesus, and raise a Mulligan-family of four brothers born of his second wife. His new family (the Hayes), operate a large and successful farm, which we're led to believe the reformed father built up once he crawled out from the bottle and into Jesus's hands.

Son, Boy, and Kid are impoverished - Boy lives in his van, Kid in a tent outside Son's trailer - so it's no surprise that they hate the Hayes and the life their father built for them. Then one night their vengeful mother shows up at Son's house to inform the three brothers that their father is dead.

Hitherto we've only seen Son as a quiet, relatively pacifist protagonist. The turning point is when he interrupts the funeral with his brothers in tow and demands to speak.

With all the Hayes family in attendance, he basically calls their father a piece of crap. Maybe he wasn't sure he'd gotten his point across, because he caps it off by spitting on the old man's casket.

That's when I busted out the popcorn. His second wife intercedes to prevent an outright brawl, and Son and his brothers depart without any violence, but there's not a doubt in my mind that this is only the beginning.  The Hayes brothers, befuddled by grief for the good man they knew as their father, are out for blood, and Son, Boy, and Kid are happily willing to unleash their lifetime of rancor for the man they knew as a violent drunk.

The impressive writer-director debut by Jeff Nichols is unmistakably an indy-film in tone and theme. There's a lot of 'negative space' here: a character stares off into the distance, and the audience must decipher a tick of the eyebrow or quirk of the lips. Son's character carries the majority of the weight there: a lesser actor might have sunk the project, but Michael Shannon packs marvelous punch with his limited dialogue, and he manages the 'simple man' affect without seeming dumb. As a matter of fact, his long pauses and nuanced expression delivers the exact opposite: we see an intelligent man who's slow to speak his mind (and is even something of a doormat when it comes to confrontation) but - once the tension and violence amp up - doesn't hesitate to defend himself and his family.

Plot-wise, the violence is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it isn't the focus. The worst of it all occurs off-screen, and the gamble pays off. Shotgun Stories global themes specifically deglorify violence.

Most of us haven't incited a familial feud by spitting on our deadbeat dad's casket, but the themes of senseless division and reckless hate are more prescient than ever. Whether it's Shiites and Sunnis or Republicans and Democrats, we're all too aware of the cultures of division, partisanship, and sectarianism. The viewer will undoubtedly connect to Shotgun Stories and its overarching theme. While you won't find any Juliet to Son's Romeo- besides perhaps his wife, who's just left him at the film's opening scene- there are definite parallels between the age-old Capulet-Montague dynamic. Considering the self-defeatism the film portrays as inherent to such a conflict, one might argue it reaches back to Shakespeare's own source material, the Greek tragedy. The deeper Son and his brothers delve into the conflict brewing with the Hayes clan, the more we come to understand that nothing good can possibly come of it.

Besides Shannon, the acting is good but not noteworthy, excepting perhaps Son's wife (Nicole Canerday), the criminal but likeable Shampoo (G. Alan Wilkins, an apparent nobody who I'd love to see more from), and Cleaman Hayes (Michael Abbot Jr.). Cleaman's character stands out especially as the single reasonable Hayes brother, and Abbot's acting delivers a convincing portrait of a brother trying to keep the peace but unwilling to let his brothers fight a war on their own.

Aside from Cleaman, however, the Hayes closely resemble human-shaped turds, and I have to admit that I spent a decent portion of the film hoping Son would go grab that promised shotgun and finish the damn thing already, even knowing the film wasn't headed that direction. If I had any major complaint with the film, it's that it didn't fully convince me that the majority of the Hayes didn't deserve to be wiped from the face of the earth, which is clearly not what the film aimed for. Aside from Cleaman, two of the brothers are all but villainized, and the final brother has the screen-presence of a wet noodle. Though Son is the unquestioned protagonist, Nichols wanted me to sympathize with the Hayes brothers as the other side of the same coin, which I simply couldn't do. Regardless of the fact that Son did spit on their daddy's casket, I couldn't see the Hayes as anything but instigators and 'the bad guys' until the end, which was too late a reversal for me to buy in. I'll give Nichols a pass, though, since he met, and sometimes surpassed, the mark he aimed for everywhere else.

Overall I'm glad a TRUSTED friend recommend this; otherwise, I might have bailed early on an amazing film. While the themes and acting are powerful, the opening is slow, and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Its a little more in-your-head than the average American viewer might want from even a drama. Regardless, I'd stand by it as a recommendation for anyone looking for a character-driven story heavy on themes of family loyalty and the hopelessness of hatred.",1471737600,,5896,4.818991097922849

3159178,4,B0016MJ6I8,"I admire the cinema of Jeff Nichols since I saw Take Shelter and Mud. Doing an inverse operation now I have seen his first film, Shotgun Stories, and it is as good as the latter works. A story taking place in a town in Arkansas, in which Son, Boy and Kid, the three poor sons of a man (who abandoned his wife and kids, became a Christian, formed another family and became a landowner) struggle with the man's four sons from his second mating. After a brief intro in which the wife of Son, the older poor brother, abandons him for his addiction to gambling (and he reunites with this his younger brothers Boy and Kid), the real drama starts when the old man dies and Son takes his two brothers with him, they all go to his funeral and he says to the mourning ""proper"" family that the man inside the coffin was a bastard. And on top of that he spits on the casket. The chain of effects that follows next has to be seen. The rhythm is slow, as delicate embroidery, as if the lines of the story were taking their time to combine, while the dramatic tension is skillfully sustained throughout. Although I feel the ending is an open one, when the movie is finished Nichols has given us another beautiful portrait of rural United States, of sections that are rarely seen with respect and fine perception in the films of the mega-industry. The filmmaker creates an endearing testimony of his people, with memorable scenes, as the dialogue in the backyard when Kid tells Son about his plans to get married, and reflects on how hard is life made to men and women (when they all are entitled to happiness and a part of the riches of the planet  addition is mine). Shotgun Stories benefits from very good performances by the whole cast: Michael Shannon as the protective and confused Son, Douglas Ligon as the quiet and wiser Boy and Barlow Jacobs as the violent and yet tender Kid, all three shine as the first set of brothers, having strong support from Michael Abbott Jr. and Lynnsee Provence as two of their half-brothers/nemeses, but so outstanding too are Glenda Pannell as Son's wife, G. Alan Wilkins as the outcast Shampoo Douglas, Coley Campany as Kid's bride, and Natalie Canerday in her brief scenes as the boy's mother. Nichols may have gone the ""Hollywood route"" now, who knows, but Altman, Kubrick, Allen and many others did so, and they did not lose their knack or soul. Nichols and they can look at their first works and say, ""Oh, how easy were we"".",1449360000,,2453,4.512359550561798

""Shotgun Stories"" is no different...

I came to the film in anticipating his new release of ""Midnight Special."" It's an easy watch with a run-time of just about 1.5 hours and has almost a Malick-like ""Badlands""/""Days of Heaven"" feel to the shots that fill the action. And there is action. You can read the synopsis, but Michael Shannon leads a cast of characters that, upon finding out about the death of their father, sets off a chain reaction of familial vengeance.

3159216,4,B0016MJ6I8,"Arkansas is the other country and they make it look as though it might as well be the moon. This is a way of life most people simply do not experience.

Here's the scoop. Son Hayes (Michael Shannon) works on a fish farm. His wife has left him because he lost some money when his card counting ""method"" of gambling didn't quite work out. His one brother lives in a tent in Son's yard. His other brother lives in a van. They go to their estranged father's funeral. Said father left them with ""a hateful mother,"" married again and started another family. Son speaks some mean words at the funeral that begins a small feud. The feud escalates out of hand and deaths occur. Will this keep going or will cool heads prevail?

This is a deliberately paced film. It IS slow but it's supposed to be. You need to pace yourself when you work in an oven. Everyone talks slow but with a certain directness. Few words are wasted here. It would be easy to call these folks white trash but that would be one dimensional. Yes. They don't live like most do. Yes one of their friends, who cooks meth, just burned down his house and injured himself. But they work, pay their bills and care for one another and aren't as judgmental as you might think. They aren't ugly, mean-spirited people (aside, maybe, from their mom). Son, who is the oldest of the brothers, seems to be the smartest. He is testing and honing his card counting method and has an even head. But each incidence of violence begs for a retaliatory response and even he starts to get caught up in it. I found myself hoping this wouldn't play to its logical end. But he does get to realize the true, underlying reason he so dislikes the other family and how this got the ball rolling in the first place.

This is a well shot movie. Great respect is shown to landscape. Yes the town is eerily quiet but this is a depressed area. There isn't a lot of bustle. The music and sound design are exceptional. They underscore the action well. All the acting goes from good to great and much of the dialogue is good and well measured.

3159219,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Excellent film. I am the 17th reviewers and agree with points made by the previous positive reviews. I think the film makers do an excellent job of fleshing out a character in his environment.

Life is tough and without much future for this guy who would like better. His proud, tough stoic, independent character is adaptive. But this guy is not a hero as in the cowboy films of my youth. He is a tragic figure in my eyes because of the ways in which he holds in his feelings until they come out in ways that just dig him in deeper. Reason does not go very far in resolving things in this town in Arkansas -- but you get the feeling it could but they just don't see that path as something they could trust.

Call it ignorance? -- I am not sure it is so simple. Life is not so easy there. He is a sad product of his environment. You can maybe understand his mother's bitterness and how this rubbed off on her boys and the tragic consequences, but we are not told what SHE suffered through and what made her bitter and hateful. And how much of  her husband's nastiness had been having to live with HER. We are left to wonder, but the film gives us a rich enough taste of life there to do some serious wondering. Was the nasty mother a product too of her environment? Elemental fighting, revenge, stand-offs are the most obvious ways to deal with feuds and grudges and they seem to work -- until they get out of hand. Then wham. Although one has to live with a lot of threat etc in the meantime. But then one has to be tough about just day to day living and working and lack of a future.",1326412800,2,1585,4.173202614379085

Instead of using frenzied handheld work and manic editing, he lets the most violent moments unfold offscreen and focuses instead on the consequences of violence. I loved the time the characters spent looking off into space and brooding and I loved the way they inhabited an unconstrained moral universe that seemed to predate the civil war.",1242777600,6,636,4.898148148148148

Or, more accurately in this case, the walking already-wounded. The frank cinematography, understated acting, and the omnipresence of crucial events left just out of sight contribute to a highly authentic articulation of the subject.

This is film about a blood feud between a reformed alcoholic's two separate families, set in rural Arkansas, and beautifully acted by the mostly superb cast.

The denouement, though somewhat predictable, is done with such thoughtful restraint that the realism evoked by the first half of the film stays completely undissipated.

3159230,4,B0016MJ6I8,"This is a surprisingly good independent film.
As if hyper-transported into the rural southeast and placed smack dab into the porch of the Hayes brothers; Son, Kid, and Boy. Thusly named by an abusive alcoholic father who abandons them at an early age and finds Jesus. Juxtaposed, a hateful mother bred three hateful men. Each of which provide the audience with a unique and destitute existence in some ways cocoon by an oldest brother Son. There is a strange brew of co-dependence between them.

The crux of the film involves the after effects of a conflict between half brothers (the aforementioned Hayes brothers and a latter set of Hayes brothers established after the father manages to marry again).
Uninvited, Son, Kid, and Boy arrive in everyday attire contrasting the row of white shirts and ties adorned by another four Hayes brothers. Son, presumably the oldest Hayes brother, ask to speak. Widow Hayes grants permission amidst obvious tensions between both sets of brothers.... As if given a hatchet for scalping, Son lets out  30+ years or so of demons and then spits on his father's casket... This event provides the seed for the Hayes and Hayes feud which for all practical purposes was part of a prophecy...

Make no mistake the feeling of a documentary in England Arkansas. Here is time to examine the surroundings, and perhaps time to reflect on familiar footpaths that some viewers experienced in their own life. The landscape and setting are so ""as a matter of fact"" and real. Just the right amounts of music, surroundings, and quietness to capture the monotone and depressing attributes of a southern small town without distracting from the story line or personal interactions. It's very different and refreshing to see this type of work in contrast to mainstream and block-buster films. In some ways it was reminiscent of ""Ulee's Gold"" but much better at examining the granulose existence of multiple characters.

Admittedly, ""Shotgun Stories"" is a film for people that like drama. The characters are superb. Gritty, and clearly depressing at times, but not to the point of spiraling the viewer into an abyss of nausea. It is in fact, captivating even at a slow to moderate pace. Although I feel the title is entirely appropriate, it may mislead a few into thinking Sam Peckinpah is directing. Modern film is so often consistent with revenge which tends to include graphic scenes either in bulk, or in the climax. ""Shotgun Stories"" plays out all the intensity necessary without anatomical explosion for a hand clinching climax. In today's tense, this is an exceptional film achievement.

Highly Recommended!",1215302400,7,2627,5.029885057471264
3393605,4,B0016MJ6I8,"In ""Shotgun Stories"", writer/director Jeff Nichols places a story of resentment and revenge in rural Arkansas. Three close-knit brothers attend the funeral of their father, who had stopped drinking, become religious, and started a new family after years of abusing his first family. The eldest brother, simply named Son (Michael Shannon), lets loose his hatred for his father at the funeral, setting off a feud with the four sons of his father's second family. Middle brother Boy (Douglas Ligon) is trepidatious about the escalating violence. Youngest brother Kid (Barlow Jacobs) is affable but intensely loyal. When the eldest of the second family's sons, Cleaman (Michael Abbott, Jr.), tries to head off the conflict, Son just can't let go of his bitterness and shame.

A feud unfolds slowly and quietly in America's heartland. The brothers' mounting anger explodes in violence against an eerily uneventful background. There is a very nice score written in part by the director's brother Ben Nichols, which is used sparingly, allowing the isolated and measured quality of life to sink in. The success of this film is due to that tone, which the actors uphold admirably with unsentimental and unself-conscious performances. The feud results partly because some of the brothers are more like their father than they would like to admit, but perhaps even more because they have nothing to do. There is little distraction from the past's sins and the present anger. Films of family feuds are hardly new, but ""Shotgun Stories"" strikes an interesting note.

The DVD (Liberation 2008): Bonus features include a Photo Gallery with a slide show of production stills, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and 2 audio options for viewing the film. You have the option of watching or listening to the film with only the music sound track, no dialogue or other sounds. There is definitely some good music in ""Shotgun Stories"", but it's too intermittent to make this option practical. There is also a fairly constant audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols, in which he talks about filming in Arkansas, casting, the actors, the locations, cinematography, story, and his inspirations for various aspects of the film.

3393606,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Indie Wire has been all abuzz with recent comments by former Miramax president Mark Gill that the ""Sky is falling"" on the American Indie film scene. ""Shotgun Stories"" offers evidence to the contrary. It's a real film, with real human emotion, with believable characters, story and setting. Nothing rings false. That is so monumentally rare in global cinema that it makes me proud that the film is American. And this is no flag-waiver fare. As a matter of fact it is politically opinionless. The concerns of a small inter-familial war can most definitely be symbolic of certain recent larger conflicts, but only on a universal level, in that all violence escalates from a certain point, and that start when viewed in hindsight is usually petty, but the damage unrepairable.
The camera work is marvelous, the cast led by Michael Shannon is impeccable, and film is quietly moving. It's a true throwback to the maverick 1970s.

3393607,4,B0016MJ6I8,"First-time director Jeff Nichols managed to create this amazing minimalist film on a shoestring budget. I was impressed with how so much was told but at times hardly anything was happening. A worthy independent with a big-budget production feel to it.

The cast was all recruited from nearby regions, including Michael Shannon, who gave a stellar performance as the lead brother. He is one of those actors where so much is said just by their minimal facial expressions. There are only a couple of familiar faces in the cast, otherwise this was an independent film all the way, but you would not know with the excellent acting by everyone.

The film takes place (and is filmed) in Arkansas, including areas in and around Keo, England and Little Rock. My HD comment goes to the massive amounts of landscapes and topography that are shown throughout the film. The widescreen ratio beautifully displayed rural Arkansas farms, sunsets, and small town decay; the best I have see in a southern movie in years. I would love to see this artwork in Blu.

The story is about three brothers living a simple existence, two work at a fish farm while the third moonlights as part-time teacher. Their bland lives are scattered with normal wants, including one who wants to get married, another wants to maintain a relationship with his son while dealing with his gambling and familial separations, and the last brother just ekes out a living from his van while coaching middle school kids in basketball. Their lives are shattered with violence when their estranged father dies and they decide to attend his funeral. A feud erupts between the dad's newer family and theirs as they all try to cope with their spite and hatred of each other.

The story develops slowly but it reflects the pace of life there so eloquently. The script and scenes seemed so accurate of that lifestyle, including a sequence where the main characters run an extension cord into their home's backyard, connect it to an residential AC unit and set it on a picnic bench to keep cool while drinking beer. In another scene the van brother runs a hot-wired cord from his vehicle's motor to a blender so he can make drinks. Lots of these local subtleties that make for a worthwhile film that deserves to be seen. The soundtrack has some great cuts of local bands and is scored with a beautiful sounding instrument that is described in the commentary.

The DVD has a brief photo mantage, a director's commentary, and a music only track of the film. SPOILER: The artwork on the front of the DVD should be ignored as it contradicts the whole sequence of the film (the dog being in that shotgun scene).

This will be on my recommendation list, but judging from the theatrical release spread (2 screens) and no advertising budget, I am afraid it will get overlooked.",1214697600,16,2814,4.756147540983607

3393609,5,B0016MJ6I8,"I just returned from Ebertfest.  Shotgun stories was my second favorite film, with first place going to von Sternberg's silent classic, Underworld.  With an academy-award winning script by Ben Hecht and superb acting from Clive Brook, Evelyn Brent and George Bancroft this is, to say the least, stiff competition.  Shotgun Stories is a small movie by a first-time director working on a small budget.  Nevertheless, it is a superb piece of work.  Set in Arkansas it is the story of a feud between two families who share a common father.  The director is Jeff Nichols.  Remember that name; you will be hearing it again and again.  This little film, which Nichols also wrote, is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and fully realized.  I would not change a word or a moment of screen time.  Michael Shannon's acting is particularly memorable, but every member of the cast is excellent.  The plot is starkly simple.  A man dies.  The children from his first marriage come to the funeral, where the man is mourned by the wife and children of his second family.  One speaks briefly and then spits on his coffin.  An old feud is rekindled.  Violence follows, violence that is, ultimately, muted by the deep but barely-stated emotions of the brothers from the first family and the women who love them.  That is all and it is utter magic.",1209340800,5,1330,4.788546255506608

3393643,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Not Actually About Shotguns, Turns Out

Shotgun Stories takes a while to bust out the shotguns, and I'll admit I was feeling a little itchy waiting.

I'll save you the trouble of wondering: it was worth it.

The indie-drama falls decidedly into the tragedy category and focuses on a blood-feud which spirals toward the clash of two sets of half-brothers. Son, played by the underrated Michael Shannon, and his younger brothers, Boy and Kid, were abandoned by their drunken father early in life. After the separation, their father went on to sober up, find Jesus, and raise a Mulligan-family of four brothers born of his second wife. His new family (the Hayes), operate a large and successful farm, which we're led to believe the reformed father built up once he crawled out from the bottle and into Jesus's hands.

Son, Boy, and Kid are impoverished - Boy lives in his van, Kid in a tent outside Son's trailer - so it's no surprise that they hate the Hayes and the life their father built for them. Then one night their vengeful mother shows up at Son's house to inform the three brothers that their father is dead.

Hitherto we've only seen Son as a quiet, relatively pacifist protagonist. The turning point is when he interrupts the funeral with his brothers in tow and demands to speak.

With all the Hayes family in attendance, he basically calls their father a piece of crap. Maybe he wasn't sure he'd gotten his point across, because he caps it off by spitting on the old man's casket.

That's when I busted out the popcorn. His second wife intercedes to prevent an outright brawl, and Son and his brothers depart without any violence, but there's not a doubt in my mind that this is only the beginning.  The Hayes brothers, befuddled by grief for the good man they knew as their father, are out for blood, and Son, Boy, and Kid are happily willing to unleash their lifetime of rancor for the man they knew as a violent drunk.

The impressive writer-director debut by Jeff Nichols is unmistakably an indy-film in tone and theme. There's a lot of 'negative space' here: a character stares off into the distance, and the audience must decipher a tick of the eyebrow or quirk of the lips. Son's character carries the majority of the weight there: a lesser actor might have sunk the project, but Michael Shannon packs marvelous punch with his limited dialogue, and he manages the 'simple man' affect without seeming dumb. As a matter of fact, his long pauses and nuanced expression delivers the exact opposite: we see an intelligent man who's slow to speak his mind (and is even something of a doormat when it comes to confrontation) but - once the tension and violence amp up - doesn't hesitate to defend himself and his family.

Plot-wise, the violence is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it isn't the focus. The worst of it all occurs off-screen, and the gamble pays off. Shotgun Stories global themes specifically deglorify violence.

Most of us haven't incited a familial feud by spitting on our deadbeat dad's casket, but the themes of senseless division and reckless hate are more prescient than ever. Whether it's Shiites and Sunnis or Republicans and Democrats, we're all too aware of the cultures of division, partisanship, and sectarianism. The viewer will undoubtedly connect to Shotgun Stories and its overarching theme. While you won't find any Juliet to Son's Romeo- besides perhaps his wife, who's just left him at the film's opening scene- there are definite parallels between the age-old Capulet-Montague dynamic. Considering the self-defeatism the film portrays as inherent to such a conflict, one might argue it reaches back to Shakespeare's own source material, the Greek tragedy. The deeper Son and his brothers delve into the conflict brewing with the Hayes clan, the more we come to understand that nothing good can possibly come of it.

Besides Shannon, the acting is good but not noteworthy, excepting perhaps Son's wife (Nicole Canerday), the criminal but likeable Shampoo (G. Alan Wilkins, an apparent nobody who I'd love to see more from), and Cleaman Hayes (Michael Abbot Jr.). Cleaman's character stands out especially as the single reasonable Hayes brother, and Abbot's acting delivers a convincing portrait of a brother trying to keep the peace but unwilling to let his brothers fight a war on their own.

Aside from Cleaman, however, the Hayes closely resemble human-shaped turds, and I have to admit that I spent a decent portion of the film hoping Son would go grab that promised shotgun and finish the damn thing already, even knowing the film wasn't headed that direction. If I had any major complaint with the film, it's that it didn't fully convince me that the majority of the Hayes didn't deserve to be wiped from the face of the earth, which is clearly not what the film aimed for. Aside from Cleaman, two of the brothers are all but villainized, and the final brother has the screen-presence of a wet noodle. Though Son is the unquestioned protagonist, Nichols wanted me to sympathize with the Hayes brothers as the other side of the same coin, which I simply couldn't do. Regardless of the fact that Son did spit on their daddy's casket, I couldn't see the Hayes as anything but instigators and 'the bad guys' until the end, which was too late a reversal for me to buy in. I'll give Nichols a pass, though, since he met, and sometimes surpassed, the mark he aimed for everywhere else.

Overall I'm glad a TRUSTED friend recommend this; otherwise, I might have bailed early on an amazing film. While the themes and acting are powerful, the opening is slow, and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Its a little more in-your-head than the average American viewer might want from even a drama. Regardless, I'd stand by it as a recommendation for anyone looking for a character-driven story heavy on themes of family loyalty and the hopelessness of hatred.",1471737600,,5896,4.818991097922849

3393675,4,B0016MJ6I8,"I admire the cinema of Jeff Nichols since I saw Take Shelter and Mud. Doing an inverse operation now I have seen his first film, Shotgun Stories, and it is as good as the latter works. A story taking place in a town in Arkansas, in which Son, Boy and Kid, the three poor sons of a man (who abandoned his wife and kids, became a Christian, formed another family and became a landowner) struggle with the man's four sons from his second mating. After a brief intro in which the wife of Son, the older poor brother, abandons him for his addiction to gambling (and he reunites with this his younger brothers Boy and Kid), the real drama starts when the old man dies and Son takes his two brothers with him, they all go to his funeral and he says to the mourning ""proper"" family that the man inside the coffin was a bastard. And on top of that he spits on the casket. The chain of effects that follows next has to be seen. The rhythm is slow, as delicate embroidery, as if the lines of the story were taking their time to combine, while the dramatic tension is skillfully sustained throughout. Although I feel the ending is an open one, when the movie is finished Nichols has given us another beautiful portrait of rural United States, of sections that are rarely seen with respect and fine perception in the films of the mega-industry. The filmmaker creates an endearing testimony of his people, with memorable scenes, as the dialogue in the backyard when Kid tells Son about his plans to get married, and reflects on how hard is life made to men and women (when they all are entitled to happiness and a part of the riches of the planet  addition is mine). Shotgun Stories benefits from very good performances by the whole cast: Michael Shannon as the protective and confused Son, Douglas Ligon as the quiet and wiser Boy and Barlow Jacobs as the violent and yet tender Kid, all three shine as the first set of brothers, having strong support from Michael Abbott Jr. and Lynnsee Provence as two of their half-brothers/nemeses, but so outstanding too are Glenda Pannell as Son's wife, G. Alan Wilkins as the outcast Shampoo Douglas, Coley Campany as Kid's bride, and Natalie Canerday in her brief scenes as the boy's mother.

3393713,4,B0016MJ6I8,"Arkansas is the other country and they make it look as though it might as well be the moon. This is a way of life most people simply do not experience.

Here's the scoop. Son Hayes (Michael Shannon) works on a fish farm. His wife has left him because he lost some money when his card counting ""method"" of gambling didn't quite work out. His one brother lives in a tent in Son's yard. His other brother lives in a van. They go to their estranged father's funeral. Said father left them with ""a hateful mother,"" married again and started another family. Son speaks some mean words at the funeral that begins a small feud. The feud escalates out of hand and deaths occur. Will this keep going or will cool heads prevail?

This is a deliberately paced film. It IS slow but it's supposed to be. You need to pace yourself when you work in an oven. Everyone talks slow but with a certain directness. Few words are wasted here. It would be easy to call these folks white trash but that would be one dimensional. Yes. They don't live like most do. Yes one of their friends, who cooks meth, just burned down his house and injured himself. But they work, pay their bills and care for one another and aren't as judgmental as you might think. They aren't ugly, mean-spirited people (aside, maybe, from their mom). Son, who is the oldest of the brothers, seems to be the smartest. He is testing and honing his card counting method and has an even head. But each incidence of violence begs for a retaliatory response and even he starts to get caught up in it. I found myself hoping this wouldn't play to its logical end. But he does get to realize the true, underlying reason he so dislikes the other family and how this got the ball rolling in the first place.

This is a well shot movie. Great respect is shown to landscape. Yes the town is eerily quiet but this is a depressed area. There isn't a lot of bustle. The music and sound design are exceptional. They underscore the action well. All the acting goes from good to great and much of the dialogue is good and well measured. If you like good indy films, this should do you up right.",1379548800,,2125,4.361111111111111

3393715,5,B0016MJ6I8,They call anything that's not a Hollywood blockbuster an independent film these days. Shotgun Stories is an independent film. A modern Hatfield McCoy.

3393716,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Excellent film. I am the 17th reviewers and agree with points made by the previous positive reviews. I think the film makers do an excellent job of fleshing out a character in his environment.

Life is tough and without much future for this guy who would like better. His proud, tough stoic, independent character is adaptive. But this guy is not a hero as in the cowboy films of my youth. He is a tragic figure in my eyes because of the ways in which he holds in his feelings until they come out in ways that just dig him in deeper. Reason does not go very far in resolving things in this town in Arkansas -- but you get the feeling it could but they just don't see that path as something they could trust.

Call it ignorance? -- I am not sure it is so simple. Life is not so easy there. He is a sad product of his environment. You can maybe understand his mother's bitterness and how this rubbed off on her boys and the tragic consequences, but we are not told what SHE suffered through and what made her bitter and hateful. And how much of  her husband's nastiness had been having to live with HER. We are left to wonder, but the film gives us a rich enough taste of life there to do some serious wondering. Was the nasty mother a product too of her environment? Elemental fighting, revenge, stand-offs are the most obvious ways to deal with feuds and grudges and they seem to work -- until they get out of hand. Then wham. Although one has to live with a lot of threat etc in the meantime. But then one has to be tough about just day to day living and working and lack of a future.",1326412800,2,1585,4.173202614379085

3393720,5,B0016MJ6I8,"I watched this film after reading Roger Ebert's review. I was also interested because I really like David Gordon Green's work (producer) as well. It was even better than I expected. The director has a wonderful classical style that lets the action unfold in a natural way and often in real time. Instead of using frenzied handheld work and manic editing, he lets the most violent moments unfold offscreen and focuses instead on the consequences of violence. I loved the time the characters spent looking off into space and brooding and I loved the way they inhabited an unconstrained moral universe that seemed to predate the civil war.",1242777600,6,636,4.898148148148148
3393721,4,B0016MJ6I8,"I'd been hoping to see a film that provided a thoughtful treatment of revenge, and this one does. With an undertow of Greek tragedy (the mother seems to fulfill a definition of the name ""Antigone""), ""Shotgun Stories"" forgoes the reflexive fatalism of massacres that achieve little more than the reinforcement of self-gratifying violence coupled to (coupling with?) the pointless emotionalism of most domestic films, finally dwelling on something closer to the truth: that revenge accomplishes nothing but adding to the population of the walking wounded. Or, more accurately in this case, the walking already-wounded. The frank cinematography, understated acting, and the omnipresence of crucial events left just out of sight contribute to a highly authentic articulation of the subject. An excellent use of music, as well.",1232841600,,822,5.531746031746032
3393722,5,B0016MJ6I8,"Not expecting much from this DVD rental, I was rewarded with one of the best film experiences of the past year.  This is film about a blood feud between a reformed alcoholic's two separate families, set in rural Arkansas, and beautifully acted by the mostly superb cast.  The backdrop of poverty and truncated aspirations is deftly but lovingly constructed -- as convincing as Faulkner or Cormac Mc Carthy, but using landscape and footage of labor (e.g. cotton gathering or catfish seining) rather than prose.  The denouement, though somewhat predictable, is done with such thoughtful restraint that the realism evoked by the first half of the film stays completely undissipated.  Makers of big commercial films almost never achieve this.  They could learn from this first-time directorial effort.",1229817600,3,797,5.2936507936507935

It's supposed to show the personalities of a certain type of low-class southern men who work in dead-end jobs, drink a lot and do not show much outward emotion.

This is an amateur film all the way and shows the filmmaker's inexperience.  The acting wasn't bad, but the pacing and editing were horrible.  This was supposed to be a serious drama but I frankly couldn't keep myself from laughing out loud at times.

3393727,4,B0016MJ6I8,"This is a surprisingly good independent film.
As if hyper-transported into the rural southeast and placed smack dab into the porch of the Hayes brothers; Son, Kid, and Boy. Thusly named by an abusive alcoholic father who abandons them at an early age and finds Jesus. Juxtaposed, a hateful mother bred three hateful men. Each of which provide the audience with a unique and destitute existence in some ways cocoon by an oldest brother Son. There is a strange brew of co-dependence between them.

The crux of the film involves the after effects of a conflict between half brothers (the aforementioned Hayes brothers and a latter set of Hayes brothers established after the father manages to marry again).
Uninvited, Son, Kid, and Boy arrive in everyday attire contrasting the row of white shirts and ties adorned by another four Hayes brothers. Son, presumably the oldest Hayes brother, ask to speak. Widow Hayes grants permission amidst obvious tensions between both sets of brothers.... As if given a hatchet for scalping, Son lets out  30+ years or so of demons and then spits on his father's casket... This event provides the seed for the Hayes and Hayes feud which for all practical purposes was part of a prophecy...

Make no mistake the feeling of a documentary in England Arkansas. Here is time to examine the surroundings, and perhaps time to reflect on familiar footpaths that some viewers experienced in their own life. The landscape and setting are so ""as a matter of fact"" and real. Just the right amounts of music, surroundings, and quietness to capture the monotone and depressing attributes of a southern small town without distracting from the story line or personal interactions. It's very different and refreshing to see this type of work in contrast to mainstream and block-buster films. In some ways it was reminiscent of ""Ulee's Gold"" but much better at examining the granulose existence of multiple characters.

Admittedly, ""Shotgun Stories"" is a film for people that like drama. The characters are superb. Gritty, and clearly depressing at times, but not to the point of spiraling the viewer into an abyss of nausea. It is in fact, captivating even at a slow to moderate pace. Although I feel the title is entirely appropriate, it may mislead a few into thinking Sam Peckinpah is directing. Modern film is so often consistent with revenge which tends to include graphic scenes either in bulk, or in the climax. ""Shotgun Stories"" plays out all the intensity necessary without anatomical explosion for a hand clinching climax. In today's tense, this is an exceptional film achievement.

A fresh graduate of UNC film school, Jeff Nichols wrote this script specifically for Michael Shannon as lead, and despite having a budget of only $250k, Shannon signed on.  The rest is film history - ""Shotgun Stories"" made every'Top 10'  list as one of the best movies of 2008, and Nichols went on to make several great indie films with Shannon, most recently (2016) ""Midnight Special"" and ""Loving.""  Nichols' 2012 film ""Mud"" starring Matthew McConaughey was a finalist for the Palme d'Or at that year's Cannes Film Festival.  If you like indie films, you owe it to yourself to watch ""Shotgun Stories.""  Basically a modern 'Cain and Abel' story, it has more than enough substance and passion to make it worth your time.
