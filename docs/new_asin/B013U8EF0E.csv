7373661,5,B013U8EF0E,"Beautiful film. Bobcat Goldthwait did an amazing job capturing what makes his friend and fellow comedian, Barry Crimmins, so captivating. Not only is Crimmins hilarious and precisely accurate with his humor and political criticisms, he is also a human rights activist worthy of the world's attention. Call Me Lucky was clearly made with love and affection for Crimmins, and it honors not only his role in the Boston comedy movement, but his social activism and personal triumph over trauma as well. I was moved to laughter as well as tears, and any film that can do that as well as move its audience to take action against social injustice is a film worth watching.",1440201600,8,665,4.842105263157895

7373664,5,B013U8EF0E,"I love this movie, and as weird as it sounds, It really made me fall in love with Barry Crimmins, his humor and respect his activism. I thought the same thing in the 90s when I saw what was going on on AOL but was afraid to investigate, even though I was a reporter, for fear of what would happen if anything got tracked back to me.

7373678,5,B013U8EF0E,"I don't really review movies much more than clicking a star at most, I figure film reviews are best left to the professionals.  That said, this movie was incredibly moving, thoughtful, funny and touching, and frankly, I think it deserves to be seen my a much wider audience.  Bobcat Goldthwait (director) and Barry Crimmins (subject) begin by presenting an homage to a comedian who deserves to better known, but half way through suddenly and remarkably shift towards the subject of (spoiler alert) pedophilia and child abuse.  It was a strikingly successfully turn, and Bobcat Goldthwait has proven himself to be a very talented director.  Kudos to all those involved, even James Franco.",1451779200,,687,5.107142857142857
7373679,5,B013U8EF0E,"Yeah, wow. I heard Goldthwait discuss this film on many podcasts and had the precious evening of freedom to see it. It the story arc is incredible. It seems to be about one landmark in comedy history, a pivotal comedians biography, and then a social issue of such cringing weight the next. Even hearing so much about it before seeing it, I still was totally taken aback and truly moved throughout. ""Tell anyone."" This is a movie that is part of the brave changing plunge into the real issues and lives of all of us. A triumph of media honesty.",1451433600,,543,4.44

I was, so I may be biased, or interested in minutiae others may get nothing out of, but I do think this is an extremely well made documentary about a fascinating person and a powerful story.
It is always worthwhile to watch stories about people who really give a s**t about something and get out and do something about it.  What is most memorable about this film in today's perpetual outrage culture may be its portrayal of actual, true, legitimate outrage over actual, heinous crimes.

I'm so impressed with the presentation, as well as the story itself. Courage comes to mind....to live this out, take action, as well as to share it with the world. Thank you Barry. Not only did I watch this on Prime, I attended the viewing at the Syracuse Film Festival and learned that Robin Williams had encouraged Bobcat to present Barry's story as a documentary, rather than a movie, with another actor portraying Barry - a wise and powerful move. I wish Robin was here to see it. He would be so proud of both of you.",1445904000,2,776,4.542857142857143

Bobcat Goldthwait gets better with every film he has directed, this is his masterpiece and worthy of Oscar consideration. I learned so much from this film( viewed at The Palace Theatre in Syracuse, NY as part of the Syracuse International Film Festival ) and feel like a better person for doing so.

7373717,4,B013U8EF0E,"I came to the film after hearing its director, Bobcat Goldthwait, interviewed on the Adam Carolla podcast and on Jimmy Kimmel Live.  Overall, I found it to be a compelling, engaging film.  The cinematography and score were excellent.  The introduction to Barry Crimmins felt genuine and complete.  Frankly, I left the film thinking that it would be worthwhile to scour YouTube for some additional footage of Crimmins onstage.

The film's main subject matter--child rape and child pornography--is certainly a weighty topic, yet Goldthwait deftly retells the Crimmins story in a documentary where adjoining frames range from uproariously funny to appallingly depraved.

For my part, I brought my own prior experience of assisting in the criminal defense of someone who was wrongly prosecuted for possession of child porn.  In that particular case, my client was demonstrably innocent of the charges, and, with my assistance, he was fully acquitted at trial.  Unfortunately, my earlier experience revealed a law enforcement community grossly overreacting to the issues which Crimmins raised half a decade earlier in his testimony before Congress.  This film presents a compelling ""other side"" to my experience, and I feel my personal perceptions are more accurately calibrated from having seen Goldthwait's work.

In terms of the actual biography, I found Goldthwait's retelling to focus heavily upon the beginning and middle of Crimmins' story--as a comedian and victim, respectively--while the present-day Crimmins (as a comedian at least) is only briefly shown in a collection of shots taken from a single on-stage performance.  Obviously, Crimmins-as-survivor is shown with great detail.  I would have liked to have seen additional development of the modern-day Crimmins-as-comedian (or as social commentator or however he is now identified).

The Rancid Produce ranking site gives the film an 83% (as of this writing).  That solidly ""fresh"" rating corresponds (though only coincidentally) to my four (4) stars.  At day's end, it was an interesting film, a compelling storyline, and a fine inaugural documentary for Goldthwait.",1441238400,3,2128,5.5246913580246915

You are laughing hysterically at the beginning, watching all the Boston comics doing their thing, and then sobbing by the end of the film!  Laughter through tears is my favorite emotion!  Dolly Parton said that in ""Steel Magnolia's"" I believe.  Bobcat and Barry made a beautiful film and a powerful statement!!  I show it to all my friends , and they all love it!  Way better than a fictional superhero film!  A true superhero  x 2!  Barry AND Bobcat!  RIP Barry!!  You will be VERY missed!!!  You did a great job at being a wonderful human being!!!  Oops, another tear while smiling!!!",1524441600,,627,4.747663551401869
8728861,5,B013U8EF0E,Poignant documentary.  Not for the young to watch but a must-see for everyone else.,1523232000,,83,4.928571428571429
8728862,4,B013U8EF0E,"This film is marketed as comedic documentary, however it quickly delves into the very serious issue of childhood sexual abuse.  Watching this film, I was amazed that i had not heard of Crimmins before I read about his recent passing (articles about him in turn piqued my interest in this documentary).  The film is engrossing and does an excellent job of increasing consciousness about this serious public health issue, and how it affects victims.  I do take issue with the filmmakers (minor spoiler alert) ambushing a family member during an interview.  The family member also experienced trauma as a witness to the abuse.  Blindsiding anyone, but particularly a trauma survivor, is sadistic and antithetical to the rest of the film's approach and message, and Crimmins's mission during his lifetime.",1522800000,,801,5.178294573643411

8728864,5,B013U8EF0E,"Barry Crimmins was a beautiful man - and this film does an amazing job of showing his character. Mr. Crimmins passed away recently; and I know that he is finally at peace. Half of this movie will have you laughing hysterically, the other half, is tragic to say the least.",1521504000,,271,4.44
8728865,5,B013U8EF0E,"Review date; March 14, 2018 (shortly after Barry's passing)
Powerful!! Intense!! Insightful!!
I am a Massachusetts Comedian - and I casually met Barry a few times. In talking with a close friend/Comedian
that knows Barry - gave me a bit more than a nudge that I should watch this DVD.
Hard to sit through - as it is Very Deep!! - It's about comedy - but more so - about Barry being sexually abused as a boy -
and how he spent so much of his life as a Proactive Advocate for protecting children and helping others.
This is a documentary. If these topics interest you - I Highly recommend this DVD!! Scott M.",1520985600,,606,4.324561403508772
8728866,5,B013U8EF0E,"I knew of Barry Crimmins, but had no prior knowledge of his rarer courage in the face of  maddening grief as a ""witness"" to what no one wants to speak of and to what no one wants to hear.
A tremendous respect for this man and now to his spirit--  Thank you for being so very decent in a truly indecent and unjust world- especially when it came to the innocents.  May you continue to inspire.  Peace to his family of friends.

Bravo.",1520553600,,445,4.261904761904762

Whether your innocence was violently raped by religion, a molestor, or by your very own government (and maybe all three), this guy humbly offers an intelligent but simple path. Strive to be better and hold fast doing it.",1520467200,,325,4.719298245614035
