3595863,5,B001G5RSRG,"This film is a touching story about two people whose lives intersect in sad circumstances.  There is little interaction between the two main characters (played by Driver and Renner) until the end of the film, but the story line draws them together rather than isolating each from the other.  The cinematography is a very independent film-style, and the colors are a bit faded giving the film an almost documentary feel.  It is probably Renner's best work.",1357948800,5,455,4.9605263157894735
3595864,5,B001G5RSRG,"I agree that this movie is brilliant, thought provoking and profoundly touching. Compassionate and honest portrayal of the broken, struggling and hopeless. Makes me want to show love and kindness to everyone I possibly can.",1354406400,2,223,5.4
3595865,5,B001G5RSRG,"Typical of earlier Jeremy Renner movies, this one was a fresh/different story that you don't often see. The story, as well as actors in their roles, moved me. I don't often find every character in a movie affecting me emotionally in one way or another. It brings attention to a social dilemma that is not often dealt with in film, i.e, the emotions of the person accusing someone of a crime that lands them on Death Row AND the doomed criminal's feelings regarding what he's done that results in his facing Death. This is a movie you don't want to ""Pause"" and I'm surprised I didn't hear more about it before I purchased it.",1303430400,12,624,4.482456140350878
3595866,5,B001G5RSRG,"This movie was so well done all around. Great directing and cinematography(the color schemes and angles really put you in the characters lives)and superb acting. I thought it was a great movie.
That being said it was also tough to watch because of the intensity of the emotions it draws on. The DVD was packed with extras about the subject the writers/directors wanted to show the viewer. I found it very relevent and moving and hope more people find this film and understand it's importance.",1286668800,7,492,4.8
3595867,5,B001G5RSRG,"Outstanding acting from Jeremy Renner and Minnie Driver. Very thoughtful script... it is very unusual to see Hollywood focus on the ""healing powers of forgiveness"", rather than the need to get ""revenge"".",1278028800,7,203,5.375
3595868,5,B001G5RSRG,"This is Charles Oliver's writing and directorial debut? It would be a crowning achievement in any career. Whahoo for the Indies! His characters are finely drawn, sensitive, and complex. Both the direction and acting are stellar - real, unsentimental and deeply affecting. Minnie Driver is Ana, a mom struggling to provide for her adored and challenging special needs son. Chalk up another spot on, sensitive, nuanced performance to the repertoire of the newly Oscar nominated Jeremy Renner, as the desperate Saul whose father is ailing and whose gambling debts are due.

  ""Take""  throws in stark and jarring contrast a visceral desire for revenge with a spiritual belief in redemption. The harsh white cell lights pound on Saul relentlessly, while the tragic story comes in flashbacks. Prison chaplain Steve (Adam Rodriguez) tries with intensely quiet earnestness to make Saul feel worthy of redemption. There's a provocatively placed halo of light in a key scene - the lighting in this movie deserves near character status.",1269734400,10,1025,5.269938650306749
3595869,5,B001G5RSRG,"The lives of two strangers, a struggling mother and a gambling addict meet in tragedy. Years pass, and they must come to terms with themselves, and one another. A thoughtful and intelligent movie.  Great overall impact. The most important part of the movie and probably the biggest lesson of and in real life is forgiveness. I really enjoyed it, the cast and crew did a wonderful job with it. This movie is well worth the time.",1267056000,7,427,4.618421052631579
3595870,5,B001G5RSRG,"TAKE is yet another superb film that suffers from lack of promotion and PR.  It is a compelling film, intelligently written and directed by Charles Oliver (his first venture in both roles!), contains some of the most subtle and powerful cinematography (by Tristan Whitman) to partner in the intensity of the story telling, a musical score by Roger Neill that enhances the work without drawing attention to itself, and a cast of absolutely first rate actors offering some of their most brilliant performances to date.  For the sophisticated film lover this little treasure will likely echo the question ""Why didn't we hear about this fine work?""

Oliver elects to present this story of two disparate characters whose lives of quiet desperation cross at a moment in time that alters the emotional growth of each - an event that is the parallax for the viewer just when the parallel lives of these challenged people have been explored by means of a nonlinear method of storytelling.  Ana (Minnie Driver) works at multiple menial jobs to augment the small teacher's salary of her husband  Marty (David Derman) in order to support the Special Ed school their challenged son Jesse (Bobby Coleman) requires.  Concurrently we meet Saul (Jeremy Renner) whose expenses in caring for his ill father and his gambling debts drive him to performing criminal means of finding money.  For much of the film the audience is unaware of the connection between these two people whose pasts have collided and who both must come to grips with a situation that almost defies description.  In many ways the drive of the story is a sensitive journey toward understanding the need for forgiveness and the necessity of finding a greater meaning to the absurdity of life with all of its random acts of violence.

Minnie Driver gives a delicately multifaceted performance as the mother, a performance as memorable for her extended moments of frozen silence (captured so exquisitely by cinematographer Whitman) as for her episodes of emotional explosion.  11-year-old Bobby Coleman proves to be one of our finer young actors before the camera today. Jeremy Renner, usually assigned to parts of evil men such as his portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer, his role as the despicable villain in NORTH COUNTRY, THE ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES..., etc), here manages to hold the viewer's compassion despite the deeds he commits.  Adam Rodriguez shines in an important  cameo role as the prison chaplain attempting to help Renner's character find meaning, Rocky Marquette stuns as a cashier victim in a brief but sensitively nuanced appearance - the list of credits is long.  But the main kudos must go to Charles Oliver for writing and realizing this brilliant little film.  If this is his first outing as a writer and as a director, we have in our midst a sleeping giant!  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, January 09",1232841600,44,2871,5.0
3595871,5,B001G5RSRG,"I rented this film because I love Minnie Driver - and she pulls off a compelling performance in this painful and rewarding dramatic film.

I don't want to give too many specifics or risk ruining the power of the film - so I will abbreviate the summary on the back of the DVD which says:  ""...the struggling mother of a 7-year-old special needs student...dedicated to preventing her son from being lost in a system ill-equipped to handle him...Saul...a hopeless gambling addict, working a dead-end job to care for his ailing father...in a desperate fight against time...forced to take drastic measures to escape dire consequences.  In the course of two pivotal days - one past and one present - both will confront their own personal demons and seek in each other the healing powers of forgiveness.""

This film is rated ""R"" for ""some violent content with intense emotional impact"" - I find that surprising since the film itself is relatively ""clean"" throughout - at least in terms of conventional considerations - minimal language, no sex, and even the ""violence"" is rather minimal.  But this is not a film for the faint of heart.  Nor is it sheer ""entertainment.""

If you are looking for a popcorny, distracting, film of suspense and intrigue?  You will be met instead with a sweeping film that in some moments is thrust forward by plot (and yes, violence), but in most others is an opportunity to enter into these parallel lives that intersect at one crucial moment, at a moment of desperation, and to walk with them through the ramifications of that moment -

The film raises questions of God's control - why does he allow evil?  is he in fact powerless?  or does he just not care?  where does guilt come from?  how does one who is given one ""plan"" for life that includes suffering and hardship look at the life of another person's ""plan"" which includes a wholesome upbringing?  and how does this impact their decisions?  their ability to know God?  to forgive?

This movie is not a distraction FROM the hard things in life; it is a well-crafted and moving work that opens a door to allow us to walk INTO the hard things in life - to set aside our popcorn and leave our ingratitude for the blessings in our own life ""at the door of the theater"" so to speak.  And instead, to open our eyes and confess that ""There but by the grace of God go I.""

In fact, that very phrase was resonating with me throughout most of the film, and I found myself moved to tears as the song playing over the credits in fact expresses this precise sentiment.

I HIGHLY recommend this film - and suspect nevertheless that it will not be seen by very many.

As a Christian, also, I think it would be of great benefit to other Christians - especially ""raised in the church"" - to view this film, and engage in a discussion about its weightier themes, up to and including the nature of ""justice"" and ""mercy"" in a world where ALL of us are born in sin.",1232755200,32,2924,4.541984732824427

I didn't care too much for it, it was a bit slow in the beginning for me and very disturbing in one of the scenes involving the little boy (Jesse). I also decided to watch because it was a ""crime thriller"" however it just didn't do it for me.

A struggling mother with her young son with learning disabilities and a young man struggling with his addiction come to meet and goes on from there. I'm curious why forgiveness was given at the end of the movie when it came time for the death penalty.

I'm still trying to figure out why the title ""Take""... I mean I get it, I get the movie, but it jumped around a bit and I don't get how the title reflects on the movie. Maybe I just lost interest throughout the film and I missed some scenes, however  I would not recommend this film to a friend.",1485734400,,904,4.183908045977011

Was hard to follow because the back and forth between the characters always left me wondering 'where is this going'. It took til nearly the end to figure out the director wasn't going back in time, then forward.  The film 'color' was used to depict the two parallel story lines, but I thought it was to depict two TIME lines.

BORING.From start to finish, you fight to stay awake. Seemingly unconnected, and painfully mundane, events are shown, as the movie switches back and forth from the lives of the two main characters. I'm sure someone thought this was very clever, but when the pace is so plodding to begin with, a lot of viewers aren't going to sit through those riveting scenes of watching her argue with teachers at her kid's school, apply for jobs, shop for groceries, etc. We know this is all going somewhere, well, maybe, but a little explanation would help. But no, you don't get that until almost the end, if you can slog your way through. I did, and as I feared, I was disappointed. No payoff. It might have been worth it to sit all the way through if we got to watch Saul ride the lightning, but nooooooooooo. I honestly hope the filmmakers didn't expect us to empthaize with him in the least. Classic case of you made your bed and then soiled it, now wallow in it.

What I will say is, Jeremy plays a convincing character. It was a little hard to see him in that role because he is known for his tough guy persona. Minnie plays a decent role as well, what I didn't care for was the long drawn storyline informing us that the kid was a handful. It was hard to believe that a teacher would have lost all patience with a kid that had bevahior issues at the extent of this child because he wasn't that bad in my opinion lol.

3596383,3,B001G5RSRG,"This movie is about what what one man does in a day's time. The choices and the decisions he makes that give him the ultimate consequence of his life. Sometimes we get ourselves into situations that we don't mean to, but it happens because of the conditions given to us. It's one of those movies about fate, where it takes you and how we can regret what we could have prevented when we look back in time, but what happened happened already.  Some things you just can't take back, but you can only feel remorse and apologize.  We should do less apologizing and more of not letting ourselves regret what we do in life.  This pretty much the message of this movie.

Two characters live separate lives, but intersects in one moment's time that creates sufferings for both parties.  Take is about what is taken away in that moment.  The story is predictable and slow, and the acting was not very passionate, so a poor job on the director.  However, the story is a decent one and the kid did a fine job in his acting in a role of a slightly autistic child.",1483401600,,1050,4.381443298969073

The two different main characters are people with heavy burdens on their lives, simply struggling through with basic day to day living. One a mother with a mentally challenged son she wants to save from being put into a state run educational program, the other a guy with a failing business and an indifferent father who seems totally oblivious or too uncaring to realize how dire their situation is.

In a very chance encounter, the two lives are intertwined for only a brief moment, but a moment that changes everything. There is not much of a surprise element here, even though some scenes left me speechless. While the powerful conclusion of this film ends on something of a downer note, it is one of those films that left me thinking about it all through the next day and leaves you pondering on how fragile that life really is, and how quickly your world can be turned upside down in mere seconds.",1479340800,23,1065,4.570680628272251

3596599,5,B001G5RSRG,"SPOILER CITY.  I will be talking about an interpretation that is a bit different from the conclusions reached about the film by the other reviewers.

The basic result from the editing procedure was that each character took a small bit of information they gleaned from their brief moment together.  She sees a tag on his shirt identifying as an employee of a storage facility.  He sees a pair of red cowboy boots, with price tags attached, in her arms.  Beyond these and a couple of other small snapshots they each made, the characters were left to their imagination to fill in the rest.  What they chose to represent them as, showed how they wished the other person to be.  Driver needed to see Renner as a poor, unlucky, hapless loser, rather than a cruel, hardened criminal, or a flamboyantly evil sicko.  Conversely, Renner needed to represent Driver as an ideal, hard-working, dedicated, mother who is dedicated to helping her son.

In reality, we don't know if anything about these characters, known from flashbacks, is true.  Driver could have shoplifted those shoes, and her son might have actually been a school bully.

In a way, this film is a little like Sixth Sense, in the audience discovering at the end that what we had known about the lives of the character(s) wasn't  true.

Addendum

The crucial scene occurs when she meets him in prison, right before his execution.  Here's what they say to each other:

1:10:10
Renner: ""I've tried to imagine who you are.  What your day was like before.  I've put together your entire life, from a single moment.  I feel like I know you.""

Then we see flashbacks to the crime, with the camera zooming in on small details about her that he gleaned from such things as a maid's uniform, a pair of red boots with price tags still attached.  We then see scenes from earlier in the movie that we now realize aren't what actually happened, but what he thought must have happened, given the importance of the info he observed that day.

1:11:45
Driver: ""I think I pieced together your whole life on the drive here.""

Then we see flashbacks to the crime, with the camera zooming in on such details as a prescription bottle with the word ""terminal"" written on the label, his work shirt for the storage units that he manages, and a black eye.  Then we see how these have been woven into the narrative from earlier in the movie that showed Renner as someone who cared for someone dying, and a scene showing someone punching him in front of a storage unit.  In her mind, someone who buys meds for a terminally ill person could only have been forced by someone who knew him from the storage unit and threatened him with violence.",1447545600,,2668,4.613588110403397

Zoom in on a prim schoolteacher with pursed lips, who along with the matronly school principal, coldly insists that the innocent, troubled little po' boy moves to a Special Education class in a different school. I could go on, but this movie isn't worth the time it would take. Stay away from this ""film.""",1444089600,6,621,4.706422018348624
3596603,2,B001G5RSRG,"I'm in the first 20 minutes of this movie and STILL can't figure out what is going on.  I HATE vagueness.  I HATE having to try and figure out what is going on .... trying to relate this to that and that to this, just to figure out who is who to whom and what the story is between them.  I ESPECIALLY hate sequences going backward and forward in time when there is no sure indication as to whether those scenes are past or present !!!! I hate dialogue that means something unclear that I have to hold onto because I know that somewhere down the line it's going to be revealed to me what the characters are talking about ....  It's annoying as HELL !!!",1444089600,4,651,4.142857142857143
3596604,5,B001G5RSRG,"If I were in a movie theater right now, I would sit through the end credits, the lights coming on; in stunned silence. The way the story is told is so very real.  People don't remember things seamlessly, we remember bits and pieces of our traumas and put them together over time.  That is how the writer/director presents the story: as two people remembering their own stories; and it all comes together in the end.  Minnie Driver, as per her caliber as a character actor, is focused and deep.  Dialogue, acting, direction, photography, music - all top notch.",1443744000,21,559,4.673469387755102
3596605,5,B001G5RSRG,"These two actors shine in this piece.  The editing and timeline, may make sense to the director, I get it, but explains confusion.  There was ""something"" missing from the actual ""take"" scene.  It was awkward, I was looking at Driver and something was missing...JR delivers his best given the script.
Would appreciate other reviews.",1443312000,,331,5.092592592592593

3596609,1,B001G5RSRG,"This movie was not worth watching. I was bored most of the time. It was just showing two people's crappy daily lives at the beginning and how they are going to eventually intersect for about 5-10 minutes of the movie. You are suppose to see both the criminal's and the victim's perspective of a crime and then she forgives him and he dies by lethal injection in matter of a few short minutes (unrealistic! and lame-o!) blah blah. The whole movie makes a person just depressed and annoyed at the same time. Why is everyone so unmotivated and mopey even before the crime happens in this movie?  And why is Minnie Driver a Maid but her husband is a Teacher acting like she is stupid? She could be taking classes, too. Everybody is a bunch of whiny victims in this movie except for the kid, who just always gets his way bc he argues. This movie was stupid.",1442361600,,852,4.3924050632911396

3596611,1,B001G5RSRG,"Terribly shallow movie with mediocre acting. Emotionally unsophisticated as if the audience should just accept tragedy without proper contextual grounding by the writer and director. Middling plot that drags on forever before arriving at the single focus of the story. There is no richness. No depth. No texture. No nuance. It's basically a home movie with a car crash spliced in the middle for the sake of drama and the most ineffectual attempt at profundity. Sad how so many people seemed to like this--I'll reserve my sanity by believing they simply thought they enjoyed it due to a lingering enjoyment from something narcissistic and unrelated.

Logically: This has two marquee names and yet none of us have ever heard of it. Trust me when I say there's good reason for this.",1442102400,2,779,4.9465648854961835

There is absolutely nothing uplifting in this movie.  It starts out depressing and goes downhill from there.  I thought ""Before The Devil Knows You're Dead"" was the most depressing movie ever.

This movie hit the spot. Minnie River delivered an awesome performance. It was serious, sad, had me asking 'why would the anti-hero character do that?', struggle, lots of lines that end with 'full stop' (the line cuts directly to the uncomfortable point and other characters are left speechless). Like others said, it jumps around through time, but that's the premise of drama movies -- the present, our thoughts, words, actions and choices, always have the past front and center, woven in and still driving the present, that past and present may as well be indistinguishable.
