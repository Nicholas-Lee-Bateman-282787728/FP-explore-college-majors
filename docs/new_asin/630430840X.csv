842908,3,630430840X,"Times have certainly changed for the most part. The world of the 24/7 news cycle has led to constant coverage of news stories and murder tales in particular. When a suspect is announced we are presented non-stop with information about that person from their earliest moments until their capture. Many have an opinion on their guilt before they even go to trial. I would imagine it would make it difficult to find an impartial jury.

I WANT TO LIVE is the true story of Barbara Graham, a woman whose life was far from perfect and filled with wrong choices early on and who was sentenced to death in the gas chamber in 1955. While the movie doesnt talk about her upbringing we find it opening with her as a party girl, a woman who lives life like there is no tomorrow. Within moments of the credits finishing she is arrested for prostitution. Not long after she finds herself convicted of perjury.

Released from prison shes determined to go straight. She meets Henry, they marry and have a child. But Harry is a junkie, more concerned with drugs than his family. Faced with losing her home and her child Barbara returns to her old ways, working in card games helping cheat marks out of their money. She gets involved with two criminals only to be arrested alongside them by the police. The charge is murder.

While we never see what transpired it seems that Barbara gained access for the group into the home of 64 year old Mabel Monohan, an elderly widow who supposedly had a large amount of cash on hand in her home. During the course of the robbery she was murdered. Now the men arrested place her death solely at the hands of Barbara.

What follows is the back and forth in the story of Graham. Were presented with her love of her child, wanting him to grow up and to be there with him. We see the legal system as it does its best to ignore her upbringing and convict her on the evidence provided in seemingly unscrupulous ways (such as being set up by fellow inmate). The toll it takes on Graham as each appeal is built up and then lost is also on view.

The highest amount of tension in the film takes place in the last 30 minutes or so as Barbara is about to head to the gas chamber. Each appeal sent is met with denial, and yet the appeals continue, the stays of execution continue and it isn't until the very last moment that we see Barbara Graham face the gas chamber on her own.

The movie is played for sympathy towards the character of Barbara Graham while at the same time showing her as a semi-floozy, a woman of lose morals who likes a good party, a good time and cares little about answering for her actions. When she becomes a mother and attempts to lead a straight life, life once again throws her to the curb. All of this is done in an attempt to make us feel the death penalty was too harsh a judgement for Graham. This may end up making the movie one of the first activist films made involving that penalty.

What it doesnt do is show us what happened to Mabel Monohan. The murder of Monohan is discussed but never shown. The pistol whipping of Monohan is discussed once and then ignored. The few criticisms of the movie since its release have involved that fact, that Graham was actually guilty of the murder of Monohan but that the film presented it as if there was a chance she didn't do it. Evidence presented then and gone over again since have proven otherwise.

Director Robert Wise does a good job at telling the story of Graham in the way that the screenwriters wanted though. He gets great performances from all involved. This movie resulted in an Oscar win for Susan Hayward in the role of Graham. For myself I thought it was a bit overdone. That may be because the script calls for her to scream and rant far too often where a more subtle touch might have left me more sympathetic. Touches of stylistic efforts by Wise are also seen on hand and to be enjoyed. And the soundtrack should be a delight for fans of jazz music from the fifties, littered with notables from that time.

Twilight Time has done their usual excellent job of producing the best picture you can find on blu-ray for this film. Extras are fairly limited here though to an isolated score track with audio commentary segment by Robert Wise associate Mike Matessino and the original theatrical trailer. As with all of their titles it is limited to just 3,000 copies on hand so if you're interested make sure to pick one up before they're gone.",1502323200,2,4442,4.427172582619339

842998,5,630430840X,"""I Want to Live!""(1958) for all it's drama and tension is first and foremost a damning indictment of capital punishment. Despite the inaccuracies and liberties it takes with it's subject matter, director Robert Wise has crafted a brutal story that has lost none of it's power after nearly sixty years. Based on the last few years of Barbara Graham(a bad girl like no other) who at one time or another was convicted of prostitution, perjury, forgery and ultimately murder, there is no attempt whatsoever in the film to gloss over her crimes and make her sympathetic. The real Graham was not very likable that much is clear. Twilight Time has now brought ""I Want to Live!"" to Blu-ray for the first time and the results are once again outstanding. Originally released by United Artists, MGM(which owns the UA catalog) has provided an excellent print and Twilight has given the film a high bitrate(30.03). There are no vertical lines, dirt, torn or damaged frames and the B&W cinematography by Lionel Lindon is really on display. Whether in the dusty, smoke filled interiors of the jazz club that opens the picture or the final scenes in San Quentin's death chamber, ""I Want to Live!"" contains vivid images that will stay with you long after the film's harrowing ending. Close-ups are especially detailed, so much so, that you can easily see the make-up on individual actors and actresses. And speaking of actresses, Susan Hayward gives a career making(and Oscar winning) performance in a role that she was meant to play. Defiant, opinionated, and only concerned about having a good time no matter what the cost to her(or anyone else), Hayward is astonishing in the role of a lifetime. The emotions and torment she goes through in the final thirty minutes of the film as she awaits to die in the gas chamber is unbearable and hard to watch even after all these years. Hayward gets great support from Simon Oakland, Theodore Bikel and Virginia Vincent among others. The Audio(English DTS-HA MA 1.0) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.). Jazz lovers will especially appreciate the music of Johnny Mandel which is one of the highlights of the film and is offered as an isolated score as part of the special features. ""I Want to Live!"" is 121 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.85:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include an audio commentary and the original theatrical trailer. There is an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo about the making of the film. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a solid transparent(clear) Blu-ray case (not an eco-cutout) similar to those used by Criterion. ""I Want to Live!"" is not for everyone and might even be hard to watch for some, but it has lost none of it's power and certainly comes recommended.",1482796800,6,2804,4.892857142857143
842999,4,630430840X,I WANT TO LIVE - MGM DVD --- Great Older Flick.  Susan Hayward puts in a great performance.  Who da Thunkit - lol.  She's given so many good performances.  While the story strays from the real story somewhat it is still riveting & impactful.  Many reviewers have already outlined the plot so I'll just add my thumbs up to the rest. The MGM print is decent.  The newer KINO version dvd is better OR for the best of all you could get the Twilight Time Blu-ray.  Definetly one for your older movie collection.

It is Wise's finest work and one of the most brilliantly realized films in American cinema.  It serves not only as great moviemaking; but, as a forceful polemic against the death penalty.

The downside of this movie is the first half with Susan Hayward....don't misunderstand, I do love her but she overacts terribly and always had a tendency to ""snarl"" her lines. so understanding that she snarls all through this movie we can go on. I have never seen a movie that showed the inner workings of a gas chamber and all those last minute death row aspects. The waiting for the governor's call, the special holding area etc. Very interesting and the fact that this was a woman, did I mention true story.

843277,5,630430840X,"I Want to Live is based on the true story of Barbara Graham (Susan Hayward), executed for murder in 1955. Graham was convicted of murdering an elderly widow named Mabel Monahan and died in the gas chamber, but she may have been framed for the crime by two acquaintances who were trying to save themselves. Though there is doubt as to whether Graham actually was innocent, the movie is sympathetic to her. Grahams backstory, noir atmosphere, and courtroom melodrama form the setting for Haywards riveting performance. She won the Best Actress Oscar, beating out both Rosalind Russell (Auntie Mame) and Elizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof).

One of the grimmest aspects of the movie is the detailed sequence on preparing the gas chamber. This is the first film to be so graphic, and the matter-of-fact way in which the guards and prison officials are shown getting the chamber ready with such precision is chilling. Because the film raises considerable doubt about Grahams innocence, it stands as an indictment of capital punishment. The screenplay is based on Grahams own letters and articles that appeared in the San Francisco Examiner,  and was nominated for an Academy Award.

Director Robert Wise (The Sound of Music, Star Trek: The Motion Picture) shows us how Grahams situation spirals ever downward, with one bad break after another taking her ever closer to execution. One of the most dramatic scenes is Graham being led to the gas chamber, only to receive a temporary stay of execution. Haywards performance in this scene, in particular, is raw and disturbingly believable.

There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD.",1445558400,5,1645,5.014652014652015

843280,3,630430840X,"I Want to Live! is a surprisingly dated, rather creaky film noir, even though made as late as 1958.  The reason is that it's purpose was to crusade against the death penalty.  The film was made after much lobbying by Ed Montgomery, a newspaperman who opposed the death penalty and the film itself is warped at every point to make its central character, Barbara Graham, the character played by Susan Hayward, appealing to the audience.  Despite the ham-handed efforts to secure our sympathies for Graham, the film works well enough on its own terms as Graham is finally executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin.  The ending has power to shock even though the stage management by the director is clumsy and leaden.

The Graham story is in fact a good deal more nuanced than you'd ever know from the movie, which makes it appear that Graham is condemned on the basis of purged testimony obtained through a plea bargain.  Ironically, the real Graham story was a good more of a noir story than the one depicted in I Want to Live! and would have been far more interesting than the one-dimensional screed which made it to the screen.",1440979200,,1128,4.615

In the little I had read about her case , the feeling, in general was that she was innocent and wrongly executed. The movie certainly slants it that way!

843641,4,630430840X,"Barbara Graham was the first woman ever to be executed on death row which took place in San Quentin back when it was apparently coed. Hayward became famous playing no-nonsense, smoky, sexy and sultry dames in the 1930s and 40s. By the time this film was made in 1958, she had graduated to playing women of a certain age but had not reached the point she succumbed to in Valley of the Dolls where her character served to highlight her as a has-been. In I Want to Live, she was still spunky enough to play a good time girl that would be described in modern vernacular as a cougar. Her deadbeat hophead husband has proved himself as good for nothing and she is over it. Back at the bar, she gets mixed up with a shifty group of small time hoods for the companionship they offer as an alternative to the company she keeps as mother to a squalling infant. The creeps hatch a scheme to invade the home of an elderly widow for the cash she keeps hidden but one thing leads to another and she gets killed in the process. Graham (Haywyard) gets hauled in to the hoosegow for writing a bad check where she is implicated as an accessory for the murder. Aghast and frazzled that she has been deemmed guilty by association, she panics and seeks a solution. She is visited by an acquaintance of the clan who proposes an idea that she cop to the crime for a plea which he promises will get her off the hook. She no sooner agrees, when it's revealed that she was set up and framed. She has confessed to a crime that she didn't commit and become a patsy. Without delay, she is sentenced to death and time ticks down on her execution. Considering that people sit on California's death row for decades, it is odd that she was almost immediately executed. We follow her to the death row cell where she balks at the warden's insistence that she dress in the prison uniform. Hayward brays at her best when she bucks tradition and insists on wearing her brassiere to bed. As the wee morning hours tick down to her 9:00 AM scheduled death in the gas chamber, the audience is coached to tug at their heartstrings for the plight of the future of Graham's child. She is able to visit with the infant within the prison walls while we question the humanity of a system that allows a mother to die for a crime evidence proves she couldn't have committed if all avenues were investigated. Since she has been set up, the whole affair is a travesty of justice and evidence was disregarded. Right before the clock strikes down, the governor calls and a window of hope is presented that she might be granted a stay. Graham realizes that she wants to live...dammit~! She has a child to live for and is innocent, after all.  Alas, no such luck is to pass and Barbara Graham valiantly steps foot into the encapsulated gas chamber. Today, that method of execution would be considered cruel and unusual inhumane treatment but it was standard practice back then. As poisonous gas is piped into the tiny chamber, she is overcome with fumes and expires in the most glamorous, martyred heroic fashion we would expect of Hayward. Text rolls over the screen explaining the historical context of the real Barbara Graham and the date of her actual execution.",1360627200,,3210,4.487179487179487

843645,4,630430840X,"Normally one would not expect an actress like Susan Hayward, whose roles were mostly romantic , demure leading ladies in some mixed- up love affair to shine in the film under review, I Want To Live!,  but it is just enough against type to have been Oscar-worthy. Here Ms. Hayward plays Barbara Graham, a party girl (nice, right) who gets mixed up, mixed up big time, in a heist that went wrong, badly wrong, leading to the murder of an elderly woman.

Life had not dealt bout a square hand to Barbara so she wound up, like many another guy or gal from the wrong side of the tracks doing as she said ""the best she could."" She got mixed up with some wrong gees and as mentioned above got mixed up with a murder. And as if, once again, to prove that there is no honor among thieves, they set out to place the frame on her.
And with her  devil take the hinter post attitude she worms her way into the death penalty, the death penalty in a time when that act was carried out quite frequently including to women.

That is where the acting part of the film really takes off and Ms. Hayward earns her Oscar. From that wayward party girl she turns thoughtful and then terrified at the state-imposed death that stares her right in the face. There is some controversy over the details; the guilt or innocence of Barbara Graham, of the actual case that the film is based on but Ms. Hayward's performance should make one think twice about the question of the death penalty as state policy.",1338249600,,1476,4.356363636363636

I have read that the director wanted to give this film sort of an anti-death penalty slant.  Perhaps, that accounts for showing the detailed execution preparations by the San Quentin correctional officers.  I do support the death penalty, but didn't really detect the bias against it in the film.  Ms. Hayward researched the case prior to signing on to the role.  She felt Ms. Graham was present at the time of Mabel Monahan's murder, but that perhaps she didn't actually commit the killing.  Susan Hayward is absolutely outstanding in this film, and her transformation from a hardened, cynical woman, convicted of a laundry list of prior crimes, to a frightened human being, while maintaining her dignity, is fascinating.

Under the brilliant direction of  classic director Robert Wise,  she and the supporting players have acted a true classic.
I don't want to forget to mention the riveting music score which accompanies each step of the story.

Wether the story is accurate or not is secondary. The  monstruous cruelty of death penalty (wether one is guilty or not) is the issue.

I'd made friends with a new co-worker who was a generation younger than me (he was in his early twenties).  When he mentioned that he loved movies, I asked him if he'd ever seen one of my all-time favorites, ""I Want to Live!""  He said he hadn't, so I lent him my copy.

A few days later, when he returned it, I asked what he thought.  He rolled his eyes.  ""Talk about fifties overacting!""

I said, ""Guess what?  She was going to the gas chamber.  What was she supposed to do?  Mutter, 'Bummer?'""

And so I say to similar reviewers, you don't have to like Hayward's performance or even the movie.  But I can assure you, Hayward was spot-on in showing what it would have felt like to go through what Graham did.

Gloria Swanson's silent-film star character in ""Sunset Boulevard"" says at one point about the era in which her movies were made, ""We had faces then.""

843785,5,630430840X,"This film is based on a factual story from Ed Montgomery, a reporter for the `San Francisco Chronicle'. It shows a jazz club, later a vice cop shows up and arrests Babs. We see Babs dancing at a party, later she agrees to provide an alibi for two crooks; This leads to a perjury conviction. She is given good advice to correct her behavior; but she doesn't listen. Babs tries to live a normal life, but her husband used drugs and things go bad. Babs hooks up with her old buddies. [The film skips over the Monahan murder; was Babs a decoy?] The police trail Babs and catch the two murderers. Barbara Graham acts tough and hard-boiled, and refuses to cooperate with the police when offered a deal. She is indicted along with the others for the murder of Mrs. Monahan. A lawyer advises her about the forthcoming trial, she needs an alibi. Babs foolishly trusts another inmate, a friendly stranger, to arrange an alibi. In desperation she agrees to cooperate with this stranger. [No warning about Miranda.]

The state's witness was part of the gang, but he will testify against the others and then be released for his testimony. That stranger turns out to be an undercover policeman; Babs' goose is cooked. Babs' letter to her husband was intercepted; he is no help. They are all convicted and sentenced to death. Barbara is sent to the woman's prison, ""the campus"". A psychiatrist evaluates Babs, and thinks she did not commit the murder. (Babs is left-handed and could not have struck the victim with her right hand.) He advises Ed Montgomery to write stories that will present Babs in a better light. Babs' appeal is turned down. Her hope is raised by a Supreme Court appeal, but that is rejected. Babs' case sells a lot of newspapers, win or lose.

Babs is transported to San Quentin for execution of her sentence. She is prepared for death. Her lawyer files another petition, and keeps trying. The preparation of the gas chamber begins. Babs will go first, followed by the two men. Tension mounts as the Governor grants a stay to let her lawyer make his appeal. But it is not allowed. The witnesses gather around the gas chamber. Then its time. Babs last request is for a mask; she doesn't want to see the strangers there. The film shows the graphic details of her death.

Susan Hayward deservedly won the highest Hollywood award for her acting in this drama. The undertones of this story is to question the death penalty as it was applied to Babs. The improvements in scientific testing and other reforms might have saved Babs today (if she was not involved). Do newspapers and broadcast media still present a one-sided view of a suspect? Even after the Supreme Court ruling on ""Shepard vs. Ohio""? Newspapers are no longer a locally operated business today. The warning in this film is to be careful of who you hang out with. Those who need this advice will ignore it.",1168041600,3,2871,4.647637795275591

843840,4,630430840X,"This film was extolled at the time as ""one of the year's top dramas"" by Variety. It is based upon the true story of convicted murderess Barbara Graham. In it, Susan Hayward, a beautiful and previously underrated actress, gives a performance that won her the 1958 Academy Award for Best Actress. She plays the role of Barbara Graham, a young woman who went to the gas chamber in California for the murder of an elderly woman who was killed during the course of a burglary/robbery.

Barbara Graham was a beautiful young woman, a graduate from the school of hard knocks. She was an amoral, hard-living party girl, who, together with her friend, Peg (Virginia Vincent) , spent her time boozing and looking for love in all the wrong places. Susan and Peg would both eventually come to a fork in the road that would end up being a crossroad in each of their lives. Peg took one fork and ended up marrying Mr. Right, living a normal life. Barbara took the other fork and began a downward spiral that ultimately would not bode well for her. Barbara had a knack for surrounding herself with those for whom the lowest common denominator was the standard. She ended up marrying Mr. Wrong, and it is no surprise when her marriage heads south. With her marriage on its last legs, Barbara ends up leaving her husband and dropping their baby off to live with its paternal grandmother,

Barbara opts to hang around the wrong crowd, moving in with a former associate who, along with some of his cronies, has just done something very bad. It appears that they killed an elderly woman during a botched burglary/robbery. When all of them, including Barbara, are arrested for this crime, Barbara is left holding the bag, framed by the actual killers for something for which she claims to be innocent. Once accused of this heinous crime, she is pilloried in the press, railroaded by the blood lust of the fourth estate. The press portrays her in the headlines of the day as ""Bloody Babs"", a wanton killer without a conscience who pistol-whipped an elderly woman to death. Moreover, Barbara continues to make bad choices that only serve to solidify the case against her. She is ultimately tried, convicted, and sentenced to die in the gas chamber.

The film focuses on Barbara's supposed innocence in the capital murder of which she is accused, making it seem as if she were nothing more than a victim of her penchant for making bad choices. Through the post-conviction, professional assessment of a psychologist/criminologist named Carl (Theodore Bikel), the film establishes the supposition that Barbara is incapable of the violence mandated by the crime for which she is to be executed. A reporter, Edward Montgomery (Simon Oakland), also gets into the act on this issue, as he ends up doing a three hundred and sixty degree turnaround in terms of his belief as to her involvement in the murder. He tries to rally the public to Barbara's now frantic cause, using the very same medium that had previously excoriated her.

The last half hour or so of the film is a tense one, as the film moves inexorably towards the execution, while efforts to stave off the inevitable by those who believe in Barbara's innocence are stymied at every turn. The methodical preparations for Barbara's execution, as well as the preparation of the gas chamber itself, are a stark reminder of the reality of this now antiquated form of execution. It is a grim, relentless, and chilling depiction. It is especially so, as the film is slanted to tug at the viewer's heartstrings by making it appear that Barbara Graham was totally innocent. In reality, the facts were quite different. While Barbara may not have been the actual killer, there is little doubt that she was guilty, as she acted in concert with the killers and was fully involved, facilitating the events that brought about the death of the elderly woman in question. The real Barbara Graham was no passive gun moll.

Susan Hayward gives a fine performance as Barbara Graham, though it is somewhat dated in style. She makes Barbara into a somewhat pitiable character, a bad girl who is really a good girl down deep, and who, but for her knack for making bad choices, might have ended up living a much different and better kind of life. Ms. Hayward gives a basically unlikable, hard-edged character a vulnerability that makes the viewer root for her and hope for an eleventh hour reprieve. The supporting cast also give excellent performances. Moreover, the jazz laced score adds the right kind of moody, edgy ambiance to the film, setting the right tone for this true crime/prison drama. This film, deftly directed by Robert Wise, is well worth seeing.",1150588800,2,4670,4.7890818858560795
843841,5,630430840X,"So says fifties ""Goodtime Girl"" Barbara Graham to one of her sleazy male companions in this true story of Graham's ultimate frame-up and execution for a murder she didn't commit. Susan Hayward won an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of of party girl Graham. Here we see film noir, the marginalized fifties' film genre, enter into the Hollywood mainstream. Director Robert Wise uses harrowing black and white cinematography and a jagged, jazz-oriented musical score to emphasize  Graham's isolation from the larger society. Graham was a petty criminal and an assertive, tough woman who had to fend for herself. When one of her accomplices asks her, ""whaddayado?"" she answers truthfully--""I do what I have to."" This 1958 film, which calls into question the ""justice"" in the criminal justice system, looks ahead to the social upheaval of the sixties when the both the antiwar and the civil rights movement would put America on the carpet. The film also, in the figure of reporter Ed Montgomery, shows how her case became a media juggernaut that became impossible to stop, even when her innocence became evident. Graham's absolute powerlessness in the film reminds reminds us how little power women had in the male-dominated postwar era. Hayward was an amazingly talented, instinctual actress--and perfect for this role. Graham wasn't an introspective woman and Hayward wasn't an introspective actress. Hayward was on Graham's wavelength, so to speak, and her performance here is uncanny. This film is definitely an American classic.",1150243200,7,1530,5.270491803278689

843845,3,630430840X,"After slighting her nominated work in ""I'll Cry Tomorrow,"" ""Smash-Up,"" and ""With a Song in My Heart,"" all better pictures and performances, Hollywood finally gave Susan Hayward an Oscar for this true crime drama. It's an anti-capital punishment tract about Barbara Graham, a petty crime hustler who became the first woman  gassed to death by the State of California. Although found guilty by a jury, the movie infers her innocence, framed by fellow low-lifes for the robbery murder of a widow.

Hayward, a true studio star, pulls out all the emotional stops and exercises all her actressy tricks: the cocky defiance, the lightening twist of neck and body, the abrasive voice, the soulful eyes, etc. She accumulated enough of them in her career to create a distinctive acting style. Sooner or later Oscar was bound to come calling. ""I Want to Live!"" isn't a bad movie, as polemics go, but it's such a dishonest one that even Hayward's crafty hysteria can't totally redeem it (a terrifc jazz score helps, however.)

It stresses her love for her son, ignoring the other children she had and neglected; it asserts her innocence, never mind her last minute confession to San Quentin's warden; it gives us a ""good time party girl"" instead of the cheap prostitute, heroin junkie and proud ex-con Graham herself said she was. Here she enters the gas chamber a martyr, surrounded at her request by the very reporters who vilified her, and emerges an anti-death penalty icon.

Hayward's husband, Walter Wagner, produced on a low-budget that oddly complements the loud, tawdry locales and characters. Simon Oakland plays the real reporter upon whose trashy exposes the picture is partly based (his change of heart is briefly conveyed.) Director Robert Wise does ellicit some pity for Graham in the tensely detailed preamble to her execution, which ends the film. And that's doubtless when Hollywood began engraving Hayward's Oscar.",1120089600,7,1920,5.0664556962025316
843846,3,630430840X,"This movie is good for entertainment only.  The music is fabulous, and the story line is riveting.

HOWEVER, do not confuse this film with the factual story of one Barbara Graham, convicted of murder and executed at San Quentin on June 3, 1955.

OK for entertainment but unfortunately at the expense of truth, Ms. Graham is not recognizable in the character played by Susan Hayward. Ms. Graham was a tough, heroin-addicted, 2-bit street prostitute who had already left behind 3 previous husbands and 2 other children before she deserted Henry Graham and their toddler.  She saw an opportunity to participate in a burglary where the potential prize was up to several hundred thousand dollars kept in a safe in a Burbank residence.  An elderly, handicapped lady lived there.  Ms. Graham was asked by the Santo-Perkins gang to knock on her door and pretend to have car trouble since she might not open it to strange men at night.  Two of the five people who invaded that house implicated Barbara in the actual violence.  One of those men (Baxter Shorter) was kidnapped and murdered before he could testify in court.  The other (John True) turned state's evidence.

Before he died, the warden at San Quentin who supervised her execution told two different people what a burden it was for him to carry around Barbara's confession and keep it to himself for so long. She had told the warden that she had indeed split open Mrs. Monahan's head.  The warden had asked the confession to be kept a secret since he didn't want to be the one who caused her family and friends to hear of her actual guilt if they thought her innocent.  He felt that correctional staff had no business with guilt or innocence anyway and should just carry out the orders of the court.

The entire reason there was ANY controversy over who invaded the Monahan home, beat her savagely, and then smothered her with a pillowcase, was because of the misleading, untruthful movie ""I Want To Live.""",1109203200,16,1958,4.740412979351032
843847,4,630430840X,"This film was extolled at the time as ""one of the year's top dramas"" by Variety.  It is based upon the  true story of convicted murderess Barbara Graham. In it, Susan Hayward, a beautiful and previously  underrated actress, gives a performance that won her the 1958 Academy Award for Best Actress. She plays the role of Barbara Graham, a young woman who went to the gas chamber in California for the murder of  an elderly woman  who was killed during the course of a burglary/robbery.

Barbara Graham was a  beautiful young woman, a graduate from the school of hard knocks. She was an amoral, hard-living party girl, who, together with her friend, Peg (Virginia Vincent) , spent her time boozing and looking for love in all the wrong places. Susan and Peg would both eventually come to a fork in the road that would end up being a crossroad in each of their lives. Peg took one fork and ended up marrying Mr. Right, living a normal life. Barbara took the other fork and began a downward spiral that ultimately would not bode well for her. Barbara had a knack for surrounding herself with those for whom the lowest common denominator was the standard.  She ended up marrying Mr. Wrong, and it is no surprise when her marriage heads south. With her marriage on its last legs, Barbara ends up leaving her husband and dropping their baby off to live with its paternal grandmother,

Barbara opts to hang around the wrong crowd, moving in with a former associate who, along with some of his cronies, has just done something very bad. It appears that they killed an elderly woman  during a botched burglary/robbery. When all of them, including Barbara, are arrested for this crime, Barbara is left holding the bag, framed by the actual killers for something for which she claims to be innocent. Once accused of this heinous crime, she is pilloried in the press,  railroaded by the blood lust of the fourth estate. The press portrays her in the headlines of the day as ""Bloody Babs"",  a wanton killer without a conscience who pistol-whipped an elderly woman to death.  Moreover, Barbara continues to make bad choices that only serve to solidify the case against her. She is ultimately tried, convicted, and sentenced to die in the gas chamber.

The film focuses on Barbara's supposed innocence in the capital murder of which she is accused, making it seem as if she were nothing more than a victim of her penchant for making bad choices. Through the post-conviction, professional assessment of a  psychologist/criminologist named Carl (Theodore Bikel), the film establishes the supposition that Barbara is incapable of the violence mandated by the crime for which she is to be executed. A reporter, Edward Montgomery (Simon Oakland), also gets into the act on this issue, as he ends up doing a three hundred and sixty degree turnaround in terms of his belief as to her involvement in the murder. He tries to rally the public to  Barbara's now frantic cause, using the very same medium that had previously excoriated her.

The last half hour or so of the film is a tense one, as the film moves inexorably towards the execution, while efforts to stave off the inevitable by those who believe in Barbara's innocence are stymied at every turn. The methodical preparations for Barbara's execution, as well as the preparation of the gas chamber itself, are a stark reminder of the reality of this now antiquated form of execution.  It is a grim, relentless, and chilling depiction.  It is especially so, as the film is slanted to tug at the viewer's heartstrings by making it appear that Barbara Graham was  totally innocent.  In reality, the facts were quite different. While Barbara may not have been the actual killer, there is little doubt that she was guilty, as she acted in concert with the killers and was fully involved, facilitating the events that brought about the death of the elderly woman in question. The real Barbara Graham  was no passive gun moll.

Susan Hayward gives a fine performance as Barbara Graham, though it is somewhat dated in style. She makes Barbara into a somewhat pitiable character, a bad girl who is really a good girl down deep, and who, but for her knack for making bad choices, might have ended up living a much different and better kind of life. Ms. Hayward gives a basically unlikable, hard-edged character a vulnerability that makes the viewer root for her and hope for an eleventh hour reprieve.

843848,4,630430840X,"A memorable film from the 50's based allegedly on the true story of a woman named Barbara Graham who went to the gas chamber for a murder she swore she didn't commit. As played by Susan Hayward (who won an Oscar), Graham is a party girl and sometime thief/prostitute involved with some very shady small time crooks. An old woman is robbed and killed in the process and the crooks let Graham take the rap. Graham is also the mother of a small child---an angle played up in the press as she waves her son's toy tiger at the cameras. What sticks in your mind, though, are the scenes where she's back and forth from her death row cell to the gas chamber as she waits anxiously for a stay from the governor. These scenes are nerve-racking and make me cry when I watch this movie. Hayward is vivid and believable in these scenes as she is throughout the movie. I recommend this film for people who like watching stellar performances in off-beat films. A fine b&w case study of crime, psychodrama and powerful acting. Don't pass this one up.",1034380800,29,1034,4.447368421052632
843907,5,630430840X,"Barbara Graham was a known prostitute with criminal associates.  In the early 1950s, Graham and two men were accused of and arrested for the brutal murder of elderly Mable Monahan during the course of a robbery.  Convicted and sentenced to death in California's gas chamber, Graham protested her innocence to the end--and many considered that she was less a criminal than a victim of circumstance and that she had been railroaded to conviction and execution.  The celebrated 1958 film I WANT TO LIVE follows this point of view, presenting Graham as a thoroughly tough gal who in spite of her background was essentially more sinned against than sinner, and the result is an extremely intense, gripping film that shakes its viewers to the core.

The film has a stark, realistic look, an excellent script, a pounding jazz score, and a strong supporting cast--but it is Susan Hayward's legendary performance that makes the film work.  She gives us a Graham who is half gun moll, half good time girl, and tough as nails all the way through--but who is nonetheless likeable, perhaps even admirable in her flat rebellion against a sickeningly hypocritical and repulsively white-bread society.  Although Hayward seems slightly artificial in the film's opening scenes, she quickly rises to the challenge of the role and gives an explosive performance as notable for its emotional hysteria as for its touching humanity.

As the story moves toward its climax, the detail with which director Wise shows preparations for execution in the gas chamber and the intensity of Hayward's performance add up to one of the most powerful sequences in film history.  Ironically, Hayward privately stated that her own research led her to believe that Graham was guilty as sin--and today most people who have studied the case tend to believe that Graham was guilty indeed.  But whether the real-life Barbara Graham was innocent or guilty, this is a film that delivers one memorable, jolting, and very, very disturbing ride.  Strongly recommended, but not for the faint of heart.

The film tells the true story of convicted murderess Barbara Graham (Susan Hayward - TAP ROOTS, VALLEY OF THE DOLLS) who was sentenced to the gas chamber for her part in the robbery and murder of an elderly lady.  Professing her innocence right up to the end, Barbara is a sly, sardonic but always-likable woman who wins the heart of the audience.

843909,5,630430840X,"Susan Hayward made no bones about her career goals.  She had come to Hollywood in the late 1930's not to become ""just"" an Actress, but a Star.  It took a few hard years of playing supporting roles and minor leads, but eventually her talent and determination won out, and she broke through the ranks and achieved her goal.  Having reached the top, she set her sights even higher, stating clearly that she was focused on winning an Academy Award.  Her first nomination came in 1947 for the hard-hitting drama ""Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman"", but she lost to Loretta Young in ""The Farmer's Daughter"".  Hayward would rack up three more nominations (for ""My Foolish Heart"" in 1949; ""With a Song In My Heart"" in 1952; and ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" in 1955) before she finally hit Oscar paydirt in 1958 with ""I Want to Live!""
""I Want to Live!"" tells the story of Barbara Graham, a wild party girl with a rap sheet a mile long who was convicted of murder in the early 1950's and executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin Penitentiary.  The script whitewashes Graham's story, painting her as a more sympathetic character (i.e., ""innocent"") than she had been in real life, but Hayward comes through with a gutsy tour de force performance that provides the film with just the right amount of gritty toughness that elevates it out of the league of soap opera.  Her Barbara Graham may be a ""victim"" of circumstances and a flawed legal system, but she is also loud, vulgar, crude, flippant, and antisocial, often working against her own best interests.  And Hayward never hits a false note, provoking the audience to a strange mixture of contempt and compassion, repulsion and attraction.  By the final scenes of the film, when Graham is at San Quentin with execution imminent, Hayward is able to gear down and underplay; she's done such a masterful job with her character thus far that the audience feels - and doesn't really need to see or hear - the turmoil within Graham as she resigns herself to her inevitable fate.  It's a bravura piece of acting, and Hayward richly deserved the Oscar she won.
The DVD is amazingly clear and sharp.  The black and white cinematography is brilliant; the shadows in some of the San Quentin sequences - especially those in which the death chamber is readied - are startling.  And the film-to-video transfer is flawless; watching on a large screen TV, I could actually see the freckles on Miss Hayward's collarbone and define the ridges on her fingernails in some of the final closeup shots.  Happily, the Original Theatrical Trailer is included on the disc; what a shocker it must have been to movie-goers at the time since it includes the famous scene of Hayward being led back to her prison cell repeatedly screaming the profanity that Rhett Butler almost didn't get to utter on screen less than 20 years earlier!

The movie leaves out so many details which are damning to Ms. Graham (Wood).  It became clear to me that since the movie was produced three years after her execution that someone wanted to change public opinion regarding the Monohan murder. Graham was not a victim, she was an amoral opportunist who got caught with her pants down (quite literally).  I am against the death penalty personally; however, Susan Hayward's performance didn't reenforce by beliefs. She growled more than she spoke and her receipt of the Academy Award for this picture astounds me still.  This is a good period crime (circa late '50's) B&W drama, but do not take it factually to heart.
