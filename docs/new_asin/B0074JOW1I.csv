8510093,5,B0074JOW1I,"This charming musical film had me smiling all the way through.  No boffo song hits but the music is thoroughly entertaining with nice low key presentations.  The story unfolds in a clever manner with serious topics handled openly but with humor.  The 1890's and turn of the century sets and costumes capture the feel of the age as we usually romanticize it to be.  The acting is even keeled, not distracting other than as one might expect it to be.  I particularly enjoyed the physical comedy and dance of Ben Blue.  Fun time for those who can get in the spirit of the movie.",1412208000,4,575,4.480769230769231
