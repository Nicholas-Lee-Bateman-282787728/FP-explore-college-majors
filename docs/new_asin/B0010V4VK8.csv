3050352,5,B0010V4VK8,"Love this series and would love to have more of it. As I understand it, this show was on for 30 years. So there should be lots of DVD's to sell. The Brits have the BEST comedy shows. I wish the networks of the USA had even half as good. Even Canada makes better comedies and dramas. The networks seem to feel that family friendly really funny comedy does sell.

I haven't watched any of the junk that is on as comedies in such a long time because they either about dysfunctional people and their problems, sex,drugs or other immoral acts. So I find all of the British comedies funnier and cleaner for the most parts",1208908800,2,615,4.301724137931035
3050353,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine is the longest running British sitcom and it is true to say that over the years it's quality has been uneven. The basic premise is that a trio of pensioners roam the Yorkshire countryside getting into comic adventures. The trio has changed over the years but has always included Clegg, played by Peter Sallis (The voice of Wallace in Wallace and Gromit) and Compo played by Bill Owen until his death. Clegg is a timid widower who only wishes for a quiet life yet gets dragged into all sorts of scraps. Compo is a workshy scruff who lusts after his next door neighbour, the fearsome Nora Batty. Completing the trio there is always a bossy one played by different actors at various times. This series introduces the longest running third man, Walter 'Foggy' Dewhurst played by Brian Wilde. Foggy never ceases to tell people about his exploits fighting the Japanese during World War and how he is an expert at silent killing. In fact Clegg and Compo know that his military career consisted of being a corporal signwriter and that Foggy is a complete coward.. Foggy even has a collection of hand painted army doorsigns.

The episodes in this collection are part of the shows golden age and start with the introduction of Foggy following the death of Michael Bates who played the bossy one in the first two series. Watch as Foggy gets into trouble and has to be rescued by Clegg and Compo and how the three go to Scarborough (A English coastal resort) for their vacation.

Expect gentle Northern English humour which sometimes drops into slapstick. I expect that most Americans will either love or loath it depending of if they 'get it.' With luck you will love it.",1208304000,22,1684,4.666666666666667
3050354,5,B0010V4VK8,Absolutely wonderful.  I'm enjoying every minute of it.  I think this series is probably the best of all of them.,1208131200,,113,4.6
3050355,5,B0010V4VK8,I have been watching LOTSW on PBS for about 3 years.  This DVD is of one of the first years of the show.  I have enjoyed ever episode and enjoyed the EXTRA interviews even more than the episodes.  The episodes are included in LOTSW series 1 & 2 DVD but you would not have the extra interviews.  Anyone who loves LOTSW will love this DVD.,1207440000,,337,4.138461538461539
3050356,5,B0010V4VK8,I love this show and the DVD's are wonderful. I know there are more where these came from so keep it up.,1207440000,,104,3.772727272727273
3050357,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine (LotSW) is my very favorite tv comedy of all time and space, at least in this universe. (Anyone for string theory?) BUT, as Howie says in his excellent review, this is series (season) 3, and is available at Amazon UK in a box set of series 3&4. Of course, you'll need an all region code dvd player with a built in PAL to NTSC converter to play it. What fan of British comedy with one or two hundred dollars to spare doesn't already have one? Several companies sell players through Amazon, but some customers have had problems that were not resolved by the seller or the manufacturer. Read the reviews. It's not like a Google search for ""code free dvd player"" is difficult, now is it? Look for the Better Business Bureau logo and a guarantee. Some companies sell many brands but recommend only a few (like 220-electronics). Believe this advice. I'm still happy with the JVC I bought from them 5 years ago. Some players play all regions but don't convert PAL to NTSC. You want one that does both. But back to the dvd itself. You'll meet Foggy in the first episode. He's an arrogant, pompous jerk who sometimes stops bragging about doing things he's never done, or complaining about everyone, long enough to come up with some insane idea for an activity. He loves to take charge of everything, always in the most incompetent manner possible. Clegg recognizes him at once as ""a genuine, 14-carat, gilt-edged barmpot"" (crazy, stupid, foolish). Foggy gets his comeuppance twice in the first episode. Sweet. Despite already having it on a PAL dvd, it's nice to have a disc that I can take to a friend's place without unplugging and moving my dvd player. If you enjoy laughing, or think you might if you ever found something funny enough to laugh at, order Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1976 right now! But read Howie's excellent review first. Anyone enough of a hacker to tell me how to give it ten stars out of five?",1206835200,10,1937,4.568965517241379
3050358,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine is the soft, amusing tale of a whole world of characters living out the end of life in a childish search for meaning. They exist and wander in a lush, colorful world of a government financed time warp that was England before anyone had to work at living. The memories of a childhood interrupted by a war they ""won"" are interlaced with an endless supply of frustrations from the peace they ""lost"", and the daily attempts to find some form of solace in the Yorkshire hills. The characters are timeless, the fun surprising yet gentle on the mind. It is obvious why this televison show has lasted so long.",1206057600,4,625,4.491228070175438
3050359,2,B0010V4VK8,"xYour best bet is to have a region free player and get the Uk discs. They're up to season 8.

  It's not difficult to get hooked on this sitcom.
 But why Warner/BBC here in America is releasing these shows like this I
will never know. Why don't they start at the beginning ??? There are lots
and lots of people here that would love to see this series released here,
maybe in box sets ???????
  It's  better to invest in a code free dvd player and buy them
from Amazon UK, at least they are releasing them in order as they were  shown on BBC.",1204070400,49,477,4.233333333333333
3050361,5,B0010V4VK8,"This is Series 3 from the delightfully warm and funny British sitcom about three old men from Yorkshire.

Here are the episodes from this series:
1. The Man From Oswestry
2. Mending Stuart's Leg
3. The Great Boarding House Bathroom Caper
4. Cheering Up Gordon
5. The Kink In Foggy's Niblick
6. Going To Gordon's Wedding
7. Isometrics And After

Special Features will be:
Interview with Brian Wilde (Foggy), Peter Sallis (Clegg) and Frank Thornton (Truly - Who doesn't appear in this series!  His first appearance was Dec. 1997 - Series 18 Ep. 11!)

In this series we have Compo, Clegg, and new man Foggy (perhaps the best of the ""3rd"" men throughout the series) bringing us their schoolboy adventures in the picturesque village of Pennine up in the Yorkshire Dales.  If you've not seen any of the episodes before don't be suprised if you are lukewarm to the program upon first viewing.  This is a show that grows on you with each episode.

Now if Warner/BBC would only see fit to bring the remaining series out on DVD. After all this is the longest running sitcom in the world with 28 series!",1200528000,97,1092,4.626943005181347

I haven't opened and viewed it.
So - I can't say much other than I've seen a couple of the episodes on this DVD already via PBS on TV.  And they were hilarious!
But - there are a couple of episodes included on this DVD that I have never seen. So, I can't report on those.
I bought this particular DVD as the series on it features not only the usual Compo & Clegg - but it has Foggy. I like Foggy much better than Seymour or anyone else who played ""the third man"" in the various series.",1448064000,,539,3.9

It is a ritual to watch these shows whenever possible. I love every one of the characters on the program. This particular one is just as great as all of the others. The scenery alone would be reason enough to watch it. The scenery is gorgeous. The housing is unique. The village is absolutely fascinating. I love every part of it. The old guys wander around finding mischief and adventure along with a little tea slurping and beer guzzling. I just think this series is the most wonderful programming that I have ever seen. I have never seen any actors do any better than the ones on this series. They all add so much to the show. I can't say I have a great favorite but they all are so important to the program.

3050575,4,B0010V4VK8,"The 2003 series of ""Last of the Summer Wine"" is a far cry from the programs heyday, but the actors and writer Roy Clarke still have the capacity to make me laugh with good humor free of any demoralizing cynicism and chock-full of sight gags and loony adventures.
Since Bill Owen died (and by extension his character Compo also passed away), watching Summer Wine and knowing the history the show had with Owen can feel a bit like going to a family reunion after your favorite uncle passed away.  It's the same people you love to see, but its not quite how it used to be.  Continuity has never been a concern with Summer Wine, it's stories and characters, so the show just keeps on keeping on with bizarre situations, absurd dialogue, and some new additions to the cast as older hands drop off due to age, illness, or death.  The 2002 series saw the last appearance of Wesley Pegden (Gordon Wharmby) who died that same year, and this series marks the last appearances of Edie Pegden (Dame Thora Hird) before her death in 2003.  Whenever she appears on screen in these episodes Dame Thora is clearly ill and frail (no matter how clever the director is you can't ignore the fact that you're watching a fading star).
Departing cast members aside this series sees the same kind of silliness that became Summer Wine's trademark in it's later years.  The situations spread accross these episodes involve tracking down an old friend who had a very ""active"" life, visiting a dying man (who may not really be dying), Truly confronting his dreadful ex-wife's second husband, celebrating the secret birthday of Normal Clegg, Truly hiding from an amorous former admirer, and preparing for an invasion by the French!
Clegg (Peter Salis) and Truly (Frank Thornton) have been joined by the eccentric supposed-descendant  of Robin Hood Billy Hardcastle (Keith Clifford), Compo's son Tom (Tom Owen, son of Bill Owen!), the cheerless Smiler (Stephen Lewis), and the ever amorous, scheming Howard (Robert Fife).  Anyone familiar with Britcoms will happily recognize Josephine Tewson (Elizabeth form ""Keeping Up Appearances"") in the episode ""In Which Gavin Hinchcliff Loses the Gulf Stream"".
Summer Wine has reached that point in its long, long history where it has become an unofficial retirement home for old, fondly remembered British sitcom vets.  It is still pretty funny so enjoy the laughs while we have them!",1431216000,2,2394,4.923076923076923

Compo is expected  and we are not disappointed.  Observations by Clegg about life continue, and Foggy will always be Foggy.  For these three long time friends life is good,comfortable, and predictable. For myself, I enjoy that comfort and predictability.",1430870400,,400,5.26984126984127
3050579,5,B0010V4VK8,"Best sitcom ever.  This is one of the better collections as BBC didn't cut anything out or shorten any of the episodes to fit the 30 minute standard US sitcom setup.  If you haven't ever watched Last of the Summer Wine, you need to give it a shot; watch several of them and pay attention to which characters interact with whom.  The intention was to treat the old guys like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer in old-people-suits and it works.  Gentle and not at all snarky; it's a great way to relax after a stressful day.",1430092800,,512,4.302083333333333

I wish they would make all the 70's but as yet only some are available. I could watch these shows (and do) all the time over and over and still laugh. Vintage 2002 was not shown on my PBS so seeing all these shows is a real treat. I am now going to buy all those that came after Compo died and hope they don't leave any episodes out.

Wesley is gone in this year and it suffers without him and his Land Rover but Barry and Glenda step up to fill the void, somewhat.  With Compo and Wesley gone the addition of Billy Hardcastle was pure genius.  His crazyness takes over for Compo perfectly.  Entwhistle is a great addition of British humor and the 2003 series is pure Summer Wine enjoyment from start to finish.  I fear that never again will any country come up with a series as full of fun and laughs as Last of the Summer Wine.  As the 5 stars show, I love it.  Wish I could give it 10 stars.",1425168000,11,735,4.090909090909091

It could be how likable all the characters are.  You actually want to join them  and have a day with them. Join their nutty day  and their behavior. The country side is great too. We have been following the original characters since day one and many of them have gone. We miss them and feel a sense of intrusion by the actors who have moved in to take their places.  Its like the originals were your uncle or your aunt or cousins or that funny brother or sister you have. Hair brained ideas to get the through the day.  It works for us.,1421712000,2,668,4.1875

Any of us who care to look can see ourselves in at least one of these characters.  Not only do I thoroughly enjoy this season and watch it again every so often, my 13-year-old granddaughter thoroughly enjoys it as well.  With the English accents, the pratfalls, silly pranks, and especially Aunty Wainwright's sway over our heroes, she laughs out loud every time she watches it.  She loves Compo best of the male characters, and though she loves Norah Batty and Granny Wainwright, her favorite female character is Pearl.

I know the episode numbers and years are subject to question having read many reviews.  My last purchase was of Series 23 & 24 (23 & 24 are printed on the package), about 2 years ago.  An excellent review by D. Williams (of West Bromwich, West Midlands, England) lists each episode and refers to DVD 23 as Series 22.  and of course DVD 24 as Series 23.  Probably more information then anyone wants.  D. Williams shows DVD 23 as being vintage 2001.  For a reference the fifth show was dated 29 April 2001 and titled ""Enter the Hawk"" with Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle.  There are 4 DVDs covering the two series which came in the set.

The referenced review states there are only 8 series left (4 DVD boxsets), we would like to have them released, why not now?  I ask. The local PBS station in West Florida no longer shows the series, but the PBS in Knoxville Tennessee is currently showing the series and the shows are all new to me.",1390780800,9,1054,4.471204188481676

When I used to watch it with my parents, I have to admit that it did take me a while to get used to the British comedies.  Their humor is definitely not the same as we have to endure on US sitcoms. The longevity of this great sitcom is amazing.  Until the very end when so many of the origianals had actually passed away, the writers and producers always seemed to be able to come up with outstanding replacements that were not mirror images of their predecessors, but fit right in very nicely.  I am saddened to think that there will never be another LOTSW.  I am very sure of that.  No more Cleggy, Compo, Foggy, Truly, Wesley, Edie, Auntie Wainright, Smiler, Howard, Marina and Nora Batty.  I think that I could probably name them all if given more time and space to write, but you get the idea.

3050999,4,B0010V4VK8,"My husband and I have been watching BBC comedies on PBS for years. Several years ago our local station started showing this series. Of course they didn't start at the beginning, I'm not really certain what season they started with. We weren't certain at first if we liked the series or not, but we decided to give it a fair try. I certainly am glad that we did. They ran one maybe two seasons worth of shows and then switched to some other BBC comedy. We were extremely disappointed with the change, but our station rotates their shows on a regular basis so we figured we would see more of this comedy within the year. We were right and another series of shows got us hooked.  I decided to check Amazon to see if they had the complete series because our local PBS station would be switching to another program soon. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the series was from all the way back in the 1970's timeframe. I was also amazed with all the memorabilia you can get. They also have their own website. This made me feel better, at least I wasn't the only ""old nut case"" that was addicted to the show. On Amazon I located the series, purchased the first three DVD's I could find and added the next three to My Wish List. As others have mentioned previously, the first several episodes are a bit ""rough"" (that's why I didn't give them FIVE STARS) and they seem to be trying to get the kinks out. Not all the actors have gotten into their characters fully in the early shows, and some seem a little flat and dull. However, you should buy the first ones anyway to get the story line and watch the actors grow into their characters. Perhaps PBS not starting at the beginning of the series was a good thing because I'm not sure that I would have watched much past the first few if they had. Thank you PBS. I'm not sure that anyone has described exactly the same reasons that I have for enjoying this series. I'm not sure that I can even explain, but here goes:
(1) For one thing I fit into their general age group (at the start of the series anyway),
(2) I'm retired as are most of the main characters,
(3) The humor is rather gentle, they don't get nasty with any of the pranks they play and the ""victims"" seem to be having almost as much fun. This is not slapstick comedy, although there are some scenes that are borderline, in a dignified way of course,
(4) Unlike other series about ""old folks"" these characters haven't settled into rocking chairs and don't bemoan their age and they talk about more than their aches and pains. They also do things, even a walk along the river bank creates viewer interest!! They have adventures and all the while they show us their faults as well as their virtues. This gives me some hope that perhaps I won't ""die before I'm dead"",
(5) The interaction between the characters is excellent, it almost seems true to life. The conversations they have won't win them any NOBEL prize, but they can be thought provoking and down right hilarious at times.
In short this comedy series seems to allow almost every individual who watches it to identify with at least one character and not feel badly about themselves.
Just the sound of the opening music is enough to relax me. Others have mentioned the location, and I agree the scenic beauty really adds to the series' overall excellence.",1361577600,4,3320,4.451559934318555

3051023,5,B0010V4VK8,I have been in love with this programme since the very beginning. When I moved to Indiana from London I truly missed my favorite television series.

3051042,5,B0010V4VK8,"I saw this show on PBS one day and must admit I liked it - but did not love it at first. The first episodes I saw were from the later years (2000+) and then I saw an episode from 1976 with Bill Owen, Peter Sallis, and (the best 3rd man in my opinion) Brian Wilde...and I fell in LOVE! The stories are so natural and unhurried in their progression that you become absorbed in the shenanigans of these three lovable characters and the many people that they encounter on their daily quest to merely enjoy the day....with Foggy trying desperately (and often futilely) to instill a bit of culture and purpose into their lives! The opening music by Ronnie Hazelhurst is among the most endearing theme songs I've ever heard, and the scenery of the locations is just wonderful to behold! It makes you long for the quiet, rural charm of an old English country village! The entire cast is perfection, and I strongly recommend this series to anyone who finds that humor does not have to be vulgar or thrown in your face, but merely allowed to season and improve with age!",1355616000,6,1060,4.469072164948454

3051078,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine was the longest running sitcom (30+ years) in the world and now it is available on DVD.  The holiday specials are as loony and wonderful as the other episodes---three old men who grew up together in a village in Yorkshire now up to all kinds of mischief in their retirement. They decide it's not too late to stand on their heads in the schoolyard or to jump off buses yelling ""Geronimo!""  Scruffy Compo wants a skateboard for Christmas, ex-Corporal sign-writer Foggy Dewhurst decides to go Christmas shopping in August and winds up with a forest full of insect-ridden trees.  Norman Clegg calls an old friend to wish him a Merry Christmas, but the friend's shed is on fire and he's trying to reach the fire brigade.  The episode called ""All Mod Conned"" is one of the funniest and strangest Christmas stories ever told and ends with the three main characters (Compo, Clegg and Foggy) rowing home in a loo. All this magic is created by three great comic actors:  Bill Owen as Compo, Peter Sallis as Clegg, and Brian Wilde as Foggy.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-of-the-Summer-Wine-Christmas-Specials-1978-1982/dp/B002EWD0HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last of the Summer Wine: Christmas Specials 1978-1982</a>",1322352000,,1274,5.446700507614213

3051099,4,B0010V4VK8,"This early edition, as in most of the earlier shows, is sometimes difficult to understand because of their accents. In spite of this I would still recommend this series.",1301184000,,169,4.862068965517241
3051110,5,B0010V4VK8,"I have seen the complete 3-DVD set thrice now.  There are some new characters in the set one of which is Seymour.  Michael Aldridge a serious actor does a magnificent job as Seymour.  I was surprised how well Mr. Aldridge transitions from his serious roles like Percy Alleline in 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' to Seymour.  Just watching Seymour's muck-ups is worth the price of this set.

For old LOTSW fans this will be another series to treasure.  The daft pillocks are at their best.  One of the characters, Howard, comes off much better here than in some of the older episodes.  I must confess that after watching this set I prefer Seymour to Foggy.  Why?  Because the lines given Seymour and his delivery are spot on. For example - ""Oh, what would the world be without the repartee of the lower orders."".  There are many other gems in this series.

I noticed that the producers gave more emphasis to a new character in this set, viz., the background scenery.  In the mode of David Lean one cannot watch this set and miss the point that the countryside is part and parcel of the show and is indeed a character thereof.  Another new feature in this set is the occasional snippet of the show DURING the final completion segment where names of people involved are shown.  Therefore one needs to watch the complete episode so as not to miss out on this feature. For example in the episode titled 'Codfangles'  watch the full ending.  I will not give out the surprise that awaits you at the end but it is hilarious.

To date I have all the published sets of LOTSW and this one is definitely one of the best.  To folks who have not watched this show before please give it time.  At first you may be put off or bored but the show grows on you and then you are hooked.

Excellent set and well worth the price.",1300147200,3,1806,4.428571428571429

3051117,5,B0010V4VK8,"Just finished watching all three discs in this series of Summer Wine, and I found it to be one of the funniest (I own all of the sets released so far). The movie ""Uncle of the Bride"" introduces us to the Seymour character, and as another reviewer stated he takes a little getting used to. I found him somewhat annoying and over the top in the movie, however, as the series progresses the writer apparently decided to soften the harsher edges and Seymour definitely grows on you, and I actually now prefer him to the Foggy character.

Quite a few of the wonderful supporting characters play a larger role in this series, and it's wonderful to watch these so very talented actors.  Of course, Nora Batty is one of my favorites, as is Ivy.  Just priceless.  The Edie character displays many of the same traits (though not quite as objectionable) as Hyacinth Bucket of Keeping Up Appearances, also written by Roy Clarke, and it's hilarious to watch and mentally compare them.  And of course the beautiful Yorkshire countryside makes me to want to go and visit there! I laughed so hard while watching these discs that my stomach muscles hurt.

Now if only the powers that be got off the dime and started releasing these wonderful sets faster and more frequently! The final show aired in August 2010, which means there are 23 more seasons of Summer Wine to be released.  Hurry it up already!",1295740800,9,1385,4.628571428571429

3051119,5,B0010V4VK8,"Just got my copy of Last of the Summer Wine - Vintage 1987.  As stated by other reviewers, this is an aquired taste that's worth aquiring.  I stumbled onto the series a few years ago and have eagerly waited for each DVD release.  They just get better as the series progresses, but you don't have to have the whole back story to enjoy the off beat humor or the antics of the aging men that are the staples of the series.  As for me, I'm going to grab a cup of tea curl into my easy chair and enjoy a pleasent evening with my ""old friends"".

There was some question as to the number of discs and the actual episodes included with vintage 1987, so here's the list with episode numbers and original air dates.  :-)

3051133,3,B0010V4VK8,"I recently purchased these comedies. Although they are funny and worth the money, they are not as good as ""Only Fools and Horses"". The pace is a bit slow and the writing is not as tight as OFH.

OFH is my all time favorite British comedy and the best written show I have seen. Each episode of OFH is fresh and the final scenes will usually have you on the floor laughing.

Another British comedy I enjoy is ""Allo, Allo"" but it can go a little overboard at times and it repeats many of the same jokes in each episode.",1292198400,3,516,4.15

3051136,4,B0010V4VK8,"Like Howie I am glad to see a quicker release schedule and hope it continues.

According to information at the BBC America Shop, this is only a 2-disc set (the Amazon description claims 3) and includes the twelve Season 9 episodes listed in Howie's review, plus the 1986 New Year's special ""Uncle of the Bride"" as a ""special feature.""

The 1986 Christmas special ""Merry Christmas Father Christmas"" and the 1987 Christmas special ""Big Day at Dream Acres"" are evidently NOT included.

Perhaps they intend to release another separate Christmas specials DVD as they did with the 1978-1982 specials.

I also agree with Howie that Last of the Summer Wine is an acquired taste but worth the effort. I caught brief snippets of the series on my local PBS station for a couple years before becoming hooked. The series contains a lot of subtle but delightful nuances, note how composer Ronnie Hazlehurst often sychronizes musical instruments used in the background score to specific movements by the characters.

Episodes tend to build gradually before reaching a sudden unexpected and hilarious finish. There are also excellent examples of slapstick physical comedy. The senior citizens of Holmfirth appear to be made of very sturdy stock, they can fall from 2nd story windows, rooftops and trees and only require a little brushing off.

I gave this release 4 stars. It deserves 5 stars in my opinion but fans of Brian Wilde's character Foggy may require a little time to warm to (temporary) replacement Michael Aldridge's character Seymour.",1285891200,14,1531,5.055555555555555
3051137,5,B0010V4VK8,"It seems Amazon has combined reviews of two completely different releases.  This review is for ""Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1985.""

This one comes as hot-on-the-heels of the ""Vintage 1985"" series set as Warners has done so far with ""only"" a 4 month gap!

Here's the Press Release info on this one:

""The world's longest-running sitcom is back with more adventures from everyone's favorite geriatrics! Soon after Foggy leaves for Bridleton to inherit his uncle's business, Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge) arrives on the scene in the wake of a self-propelled wheelbarrow, the first of many wacky inventions to leap from the mind of this retired headmaster. Clegg takes Compo and Seymour on a sentimental journey to re-create the times when his old school chums would walk gates and climb trees together. Also, Compo willingly agrees to ""road-test"" Seymour's new concept of a gentleman's purse (especially as there will be real money provided in it), and Edie's days of carrying a heavy dustbin are numbered when Seymour decides to install a new waste disposal unit for her.""

This is reported to be a 3-disc set and will include the 1986 New Year's Special ""Uncle of the Bride"".  It is said to run approx. 299 minutes for 12 episodes.  But this brings up a bit of conflict.  More on that below.

So, ""Vintage 1987"" you ask?  Seems odd as the *only* episode of LOTSW to air in 1987 is ""Big Day at Dream Acres"" which is the Christmas Special from that year!  Considering the inclusion of ""Uncle of the Bride"" which is considered episode 0 of Series 9, I'm assuming this will actually be Series 9 from 1986 and have the following episodes:

Series 9, Episode 0 - Uncle of the Bride
Original Air Date - 1 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 1 - Why Does Norman Clegg Buy Ladies' Elastic Stockings?
Original Air Date - 4 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 2 - The Heavily Reinforced Bottom
Original Air Date - 11 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 3 - Dried Dates and Codfanglers

Series 9, Episode 4 - The Really Masculine Purse
Original Air Date - 25 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 5 - Who's Feeling Ejected Then?

The conflict arises as including the 2 Christmas Specials, which is necessary for the set to be called 1987, and ""Uncle of the Bride"" brings the episode total to 15, not 12.  Even if the Christmas Specials are not on the release, including ""Uncle of the Bride"" causes the announced episode count to be off!

I'll post updates as I get them but for now I'm expecting this to be what I've listed due to the ""Vintage 1987"" in the set name.

As I've said on many of my reviews of the LOTSW sets, don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to LOTSW on first viewing. This show grows on you over time. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... it was slow and seemed almost without a plot. But after watching a few more episodes I was hooked!

Now that you've moved one release a couple of months closer to the last, Warner Brothers, how about a more realistic release pace of 4-5 series a year for the longest running sitcom in the world!",1285459200,38,3864,4.4460227272727275

I put it off for a couple years because I didn't recognize the Cyril character and didn't know if I'd like it.  It turned out to be FANTASTIC but that's beside the point.  The early shows turned out to be MUCH more quick-witted and sharp than the later ones which seem pretty sedate when compared.  I don't consider the 'Sam' episode a rerun because of the different manufacturer and I'm glad to have it IN SEQUENCE.  What if the BBC had skipped it because it had been released earlier?  An equal possibly larger number of folks would be complaining that they were missing an episode or that they weren't all released in chronological order!  The 'new' release is probably better quality too!  Forget the complaints, be glad we're getting new stuff.",1284508800,,897,4.591194968553459

Do we really need a rerun on a DVD? Doesn't anyone at the BBC check these things? Really!!! It is an excellent dvd except for this. I don't feel as though I got my money's worth!

Watched the show on PBS (thanks for that) first and after seeing a few episodes really started enjoying the shows.  The writing is just great thanks to Roy Clarke who has written every episode.  The three lead actors in these four specials do a good job of making you feel that you're right there with them.  If you like other greats such as : the Marks Brothers, Our Gang comedies, Abbott & Costello and the 3 Stooges, then I think you'll like these Christmas Specials.  Get hooked on these and you'll want all the ""Last of the Summer Wine"" that is out on DVDs to watch over & over again.

FINALLY!!! The ""Christmas Special"" episodes are included!!

I maintain my plea to Warner/BBC:
Get on with it! At the current release rate of 2 series per year we'll see the successor to Blu-ray come to market before all series are out on standard DVD! For a program with a over 30 year run, 2 per year is entirely too slow a release rate!

Note: If Warners continues the current chronological release schedule, the next, series 9 - from 1986, should have 15 episodes if the Christmas Specials are included.  I can hardly wait!

Observasion: Why do British series from BBC/Warner cost so much per episode?!?  Based on typical American sit-com series this should go for half the current SRP.

These senior-citizen/youngsters try, with some hilarious results, to relive the joy of their youthful Christmases.  I found myself laughing out loud at their antics and their wives reaction to their husbands reluctance to grow up.  I am so glad that they hold on to their quest to grow older without growing old.

Some of the writing after that was a little repiticious but I didn't mind hearing it again. I am sickly and spend a lot of time in bed.

I have one confession.  I truly miss Michael Bates not that I don't like Brian Wilde, he is perfect.  But I miss the rapier like delivery of Bates.  Another drawback of this and the other sets that I own is that there are no inserts in the DVD packaging giving some more information like dates when the episodes were shot etc.

The Brits have the BEST comedy shows. I wish the networks of the USA had even half as good. Even Canada makes better comedies and dramas. The networks seem to feel that family friendly really funny comedy does sell.

I haven't watched any of the junk that is on as comedies in such a long time because they either about dysfunctional people and their problems, sex,drugs or other immoral acts. So I find all of the British comedies funnier and cleaner for the most parts",1208908800,2,615,4.301724137931035
3284850,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine is the longest running British sitcom and it is true to say that over the years it's quality has been uneven. The basic premise is that a trio of pensioners roam the Yorkshire countryside getting into comic adventures. The trio has changed over the years but has always included Clegg, played by Peter Sallis (The voice of Wallace in Wallace and Gromit) and Compo played by Bill Owen until his death. Clegg is a timid widower who only wishes for a quiet life yet gets dragged into all sorts of scraps. Compo is a workshy scruff who lusts after his next door neighbour, the fearsome Nora Batty. Completing the trio there is always a bossy one played by different actors at various times. This series introduces the longest running third man, Walter 'Foggy' Dewhurst played by Brian Wilde. Foggy never ceases to tell people about his exploits fighting the Japanese during World War and how he is an expert at silent killing. In fact Clegg and Compo know that his military career consisted of being a corporal signwriter and that Foggy is a complete coward.. Foggy even has a collection of hand painted army doorsigns.

The episodes in this collection are part of the shows golden age and start with the introduction of Foggy following the death of Michael Bates who played the bossy one in the first two series. Watch as Foggy gets into trouble and has to be rescued by Clegg and Compo and how the three go to Scarborough (A English coastal resort) for their vacation.

Expect gentle Northern English humour which sometimes drops into slapstick. I expect that most Americans will either love or loath it depending of if they 'get it.' With luck you will love it.",1208304000,22,1684,4.666666666666667

3284854,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine (LotSW) is my very favorite tv comedy of all time and space, at least in this universe. (Anyone for string theory?) BUT, as Howie says in his excellent review, this is series (season) 3, and is available at Amazon UK in a box set of series 3&4. Of course, you'll need an all region code dvd player with a built in PAL to NTSC converter to play it. What fan of British comedy with one or two hundred dollars to spare doesn't already have one? Several companies sell players through Amazon, but some customers have had problems that were not resolved by the seller or the manufacturer. Read the reviews. It's not like a Google search for ""code free dvd player"" is difficult, now is it? Look for the Better Business Bureau logo and a guarantee. Some companies sell many brands but recommend only a few (like 220-electronics). Believe this advice. I'm still happy with the JVC I bought from them 5 years ago. Some players play all regions but don't convert PAL to NTSC. You want one that does both. But back to the dvd itself. You'll meet Foggy in the first episode. He's an arrogant, pompous jerk who sometimes stops bragging about doing things he's never done, or complaining about everyone, long enough to come up with some insane idea for an activity. He loves to take charge of everything, always in the most incompetent manner possible. Clegg recognizes him at once as ""a genuine, 14-carat, gilt-edged barmpot"" (crazy, stupid, foolish). Foggy gets his comeuppance twice in the first episode. Sweet. Despite already having it on a PAL dvd, it's nice to have a disc that I can take to a friend's place without unplugging and moving my dvd player. If you enjoy laughing, or think you might if you ever found something funny enough to laugh at, order Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1976 right now! But read Howie's excellent review first.

It is a ritual to watch these shows whenever possible. I love every one of the characters on the program. This particular one is just as great as all of the others. The scenery alone would be reason enough to watch it. The scenery is gorgeous. The housing is unique. The village is absolutely fascinating. I love every part of it. The old guys wander around finding mischief and adventure along with a little tea slurping and beer guzzling. I just think this series is the most wonderful programming that I have ever seen. I have never seen any actors do any better than the ones on this series. They all add so much to the show. I can't say I have a great favorite but they all are so important to the program. It makes me happy.,1438387200,2,904,4.23121387283237

3285072,4,B0010V4VK8,"The 2003 series of ""Last of the Summer Wine"" is a far cry from the programs heyday, but the actors and writer Roy Clarke still have the capacity to make me laugh with good humor free of any demoralizing cynicism and chock-full of sight gags and loony adventures.
Since Bill Owen died (and by extension his character Compo also passed away), watching Summer Wine and knowing the history the show had with Owen can feel a bit like going to a family reunion after your favorite uncle passed away.  It's the same people you love to see, but its not quite how it used to be.  Continuity has never been a concern with Summer Wine, it's stories and characters, so the show just keeps on keeping on with bizarre situations, absurd dialogue, and some new additions to the cast as older hands drop off due to age, illness, or death.  The 2002 series saw the last appearance of Wesley Pegden (Gordon Wharmby) who died that same year, and this series marks the last appearances of Edie Pegden (Dame Thora Hird) before her death in 2003.  Whenever she appears on screen in these episodes Dame Thora is clearly ill and frail (no matter how clever the director is you can't ignore the fact that you're watching a fading star).
Departing cast members aside this series sees the same kind of silliness that became Summer Wine's trademark in it's later years.  The situations spread accross these episodes involve tracking down an old friend who had a very ""active"" life, visiting a dying man (who may not really be dying), Truly confronting his dreadful ex-wife's second husband, celebrating the secret birthday of Normal Clegg, Truly hiding from an amorous former admirer, and preparing for an invasion by the French!
Clegg (Peter Salis) and Truly (Frank Thornton) have been joined by the eccentric supposed-descendant  of Robin Hood Billy Hardcastle (Keith Clifford), Compo's son Tom (Tom Owen, son of Bill Owen!), the cheerless Smiler (Stephen Lewis), and the ever amorous, scheming Howard (Robert Fife).  Anyone familiar with Britcoms will happily recognize Josephine Tewson (Elizabeth form ""Keeping Up Appearances"") in the episode ""In Which Gavin Hinchcliff Loses the Gulf Stream"".
Summer Wine has reached that point in its long, long history where it has become an unofficial retirement home for old, fondly remembered British sitcom vets.  It is still pretty funny so enjoy the laughs while we have them!",1431216000,2,2394,4.923076923076923

Compo is expected  and we are not disappointed.  Observations by Clegg about life continue, and Foggy will always be Foggy.  For these three long time friends life is good,comfortable, and predictable. For myself, I enjoy that comfort and predictability.",1430870400,,400,5.26984126984127
3285076,5,B0010V4VK8,"Best sitcom ever.  This is one of the better collections as BBC didn't cut anything out or shorten any of the episodes to fit the 30 minute standard US sitcom setup.  If you haven't ever watched Last of the Summer Wine, you need to give it a shot; watch several of them and pay attention to which characters interact with whom.  The intention was to treat the old guys like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer in old-people-suits and it works.  Gentle and not at all snarky; it's a great way to relax after a stressful day.",1430092800,,512,4.302083333333333

Wesley is gone in this year and it suffers without him and his Land Rover but Barry and Glenda step up to fill the void, somewhat.  With Compo and Wesley gone the addition of Billy Hardcastle was pure genius.  His crazyness takes over for Compo perfectly.  Entwhistle is a great addition of British humor and the 2003 series is pure Summer Wine enjoyment from start to finish.

I am very sure that there will never be any sitcoms even close this LOTSW and a couple of the other British sitcoms.

3285206,5,B0010V4VK8,I find this series very funny and enjoyable. It is not very complicated and the humor is silly but it leaves you with wanting more. It could be how likable all the characters are.  You actually want to join them  and have a day with them. Join their nutty day  and their behavior. The country side is great too. We have been following the original characters since day one and many of them have gone. We miss them and feel a sense of intrusion by the actors who have moved in to take their places.  Its like the originals were your uncle or your aunt or cousins or that funny brother or sister you have. Hair brained ideas to get the through the day.  It works for us.,1421712000,2,668,4.1875

It is hard to believe that a series with the same basic formula can last 30 years and stay fresh. I discover things I missed the first ten times because the banter is so quick. I've had many hours of enjoyment watching this series. There are favorites in each season so couldn't narrow the best season to just one.

Any of us who care to look can see ourselves in at least one of these characters.  Not only do I thoroughly enjoy this season and watch it again every so often, my 13-year-old granddaughter thoroughly enjoys it as well.  With the English accents, the pratfalls, silly pranks, and especially Aunty Wainwright's sway over our heroes, she laughs out loud every time she watches it.  She loves Compo best of the male characters, and though she loves Norah Batty and Granny Wainwright, her favorite female character is Pearl.

I know the episode numbers and years are subject to question having read many reviews.  My last purchase was of Series 23 & 24 (23 & 24 are printed on the package), about 2 years ago.  An excellent review by D. Williams (of West Bromwich, West Midlands, England) lists each episode and refers to DVD 23 as Series 22.  and of course DVD 24 as Series 23.  Probably more information then anyone wants.  D. Williams shows DVD 23 as being vintage 2001.  For a reference the fifth show was dated 29 April 2001 and titled ""Enter the Hawk"" with Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle.  There are 4 DVDs covering the two series which came in the set.

The referenced review states there are only 8 series left (4 DVD boxsets), we would like to have them released, why not now?  I ask. The local PBS station in West Florida no longer shows the series, but the PBS in Knoxville Tennessee is currently showing the series and the shows are all new to me.",1390780800,9,1054,4.471204188481676

When I used to watch it with my parents, I have to admit that it did take me a while to get used to the British comedies.  Their humor is definitely not the same as we have to endure on US sitcoms. The longevity of this great sitcom is amazing.  Until the very end when so many of the origianals had actually passed away, the writers and producers always seemed to be able to come up with outstanding replacements that were not mirror images of their predecessors, but fit right in very nicely.  I am saddened to think that there will never be another LOTSW.  I am very sure of that.  No more Cleggy, Compo, Foggy, Truly, Wesley, Edie, Auntie Wainright, Smiler, Howard, Marina and Nora Batty.  I think that I could probably name them all if given more time and space to write, but you get the idea.

I love, love, love the Last of the Summer Wine programs.

Being a little hard of hearing, especially when it comes to some of the Yorkshire accents, I especially appreciate the subtitles options. I have never been able to decipher the ""closed captions"" feature of my TV or VCR player. With the subtitles option on the discs, I can click ""on"" and then I'm able to understand every word.

I have every Last of the Summer Wine DVD that has been released. I am so excited each time I read about another one on the way.  They are sometimes released first on BBC America's site, but I wait to get the free shipping and much better price here at Amazon.

My only complaint is that all thirty seasons' episodes are not released as one huge collection. I know the Dark Shadows drama was released as a complete series of more than 1,000 episodes. I believe LOTSW has just over 300 episodes.",1363132800,,912,4.536585365853658

3285496,4,B0010V4VK8,"My husband and I have been watching BBC comedies on PBS for years. Several years ago our local station started showing this series. Of course they didn't start at the beginning, I'm not really certain what season they started with. We weren't certain at first if we liked the series or not, but we decided to give it a fair try. I certainly am glad that we did. They ran one maybe two seasons worth of shows and then switched to some other BBC comedy. We were extremely disappointed with the change, but our station rotates their shows on a regular basis so we figured we would see more of this comedy within the year. We were right and another series of shows got us hooked.  I decided to check Amazon to see if they had the complete series because our local PBS station would be switching to another program soon. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the series was from all the way back in the 1970's timeframe. I was also amazed with all the memorabilia you can get. They also have their own website. This made me feel better, at least I wasn't the only ""old nut case"" that was addicted to the show. On Amazon I located the series, purchased the first three DVD's I could find and added the next three to My Wish List. As others have mentioned previously, the first several episodes are a bit ""rough"" (that's why I didn't give them FIVE STARS) and they seem to be trying to get the kinks out. Not all the actors have gotten into their characters fully in the early shows, and some seem a little flat and dull. However, you should buy the first ones anyway to get the story line and watch the actors grow into their characters. Perhaps PBS not starting at the beginning of the series was a good thing because I'm not sure that I would have watched much past the first few if they had. Thank you PBS. I'm not sure that anyone has described exactly the same reasons that I have for enjoying this series. I'm not sure that I can even explain, but here goes:
(1) For one thing I fit into their general age group (at the start of the series anyway),
(2) I'm retired as are most of the main characters,
(3) The humor is rather gentle, they don't get nasty with any of the pranks they play and the ""victims"" seem to be having almost as much fun. This is not slapstick comedy, although there are some scenes that are borderline, in a dignified way of course,
(4) Unlike other series about ""old folks"" these characters haven't settled into rocking chairs and don't bemoan their age and they talk about more than their aches and pains. They also do things, even a walk along the river bank creates viewer interest!! They have adventures and all the while they show us their faults as well as their virtues. This gives me some hope that perhaps I won't ""die before I'm dead"",
(5) The interaction between the characters is excellent, it almost seems true to life. The conversations they have won't win them any NOBEL prize, but they can be thought provoking and down right hilarious at times.
In short this comedy series seems to allow almost every individual who watches it to identify with at least one character and not feel badly about themselves.
Just the sound of the opening music is enough to relax me. Others have mentioned the location, and I agree the scenic beauty really adds to the series' overall excellence.",1361577600,4,3320,4.451559934318555

3285520,5,B0010V4VK8,I have been in love with this programme since the very beginning. When I moved to Indiana from London I truly missed my favorite television series.

The first episodes I saw were from the later years (2000+) and then I saw an episode from 1976 with Bill Owen, Peter Sallis, and (the best 3rd man in my opinion) Brian Wilde...and I fell in LOVE! The stories are so natural and unhurried in their progression that you become absorbed in the shenanigans of these three lovable characters and the many people that they encounter on their daily quest to merely enjoy the day....with Foggy trying desperately (and often futilely) to instill a bit of culture and purpose into their lives! The opening music by Ronnie Hazelhurst is among the most endearing theme songs I've ever heard, and the scenery of the locations is just wonderful to behold! It makes you long for the quiet, rural charm of an old English country village! The entire cast is perfection, and I strongly recommend this series to anyone who finds that humor does not have to be vulgar or thrown in your face, but merely allowed to season and improve with age!",1355616000,6,1060,4.469072164948454

3285575,5,B0010V4VK8,"Last of the Summer Wine was the longest running sitcom (30+ years) in the world and now it is available on DVD.  The holiday specials are as loony and wonderful as the other episodes---three old men who grew up together in a village in Yorkshire now up to all kinds of mischief in their retirement. They decide it's not too late to stand on their heads in the schoolyard or to jump off buses yelling ""Geronimo!""  Scruffy Compo wants a skateboard for Christmas, ex-Corporal sign-writer Foggy Dewhurst decides to go Christmas shopping in August and winds up with a forest full of insect-ridden trees.  Norman Clegg calls an old friend to wish him a Merry Christmas, but the friend's shed is on fire and he's trying to reach the fire brigade.  The episode called ""All Mod Conned"" is one of the funniest and strangest Christmas stories ever told and ends with the three main characters (Compo, Clegg and Foggy) rowing home in a loo. All this magic is created by three great comic actors:  Bill Owen as Compo, Peter Sallis as Clegg, and Brian Wilde as Foggy.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-of-the-Summer-Wine-Christmas-Specials-1978-1982/dp/B002EWD0HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last of the Summer Wine: Christmas Specials 1978-1982</a>",1322352000,,1274,5.446700507614213

3285607,5,B0010V4VK8,"I have seen the complete 3-DVD set thrice now.  There are some new characters in the set one of which is Seymour.  Michael Aldridge a serious actor does a magnificent job as Seymour.  I was surprised how well Mr. Aldridge transitions from his serious roles like Percy Alleline in 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' to Seymour.  Just watching Seymour's muck-ups is worth the price of this set.

For old LOTSW fans this will be another series to treasure.  The daft pillocks are at their best.  One of the characters, Howard, comes off much better here than in some of the older episodes.  I must confess that after watching this set I prefer Seymour to Foggy.  Why?  Because the lines given Seymour and his delivery are spot on. For example - ""Oh, what would the world be without the repartee of the lower orders."".  There are many other gems in this series.

I noticed that the producers gave more emphasis to a new character in this set, viz., the background scenery.  In the mode of David Lean one cannot watch this set and miss the point that the countryside is part and parcel of the show and is indeed a character thereof.  Another new feature in this set is the occasional snippet of the show DURING the final completion segment where names of people involved are shown.  Therefore one needs to watch the complete episode so as not to miss out on this feature. For example in the episode titled 'Codfangles'  watch the full ending.  I will not give out the surprise that awaits you at the end but it is hilarious.

To date I have all the published sets of LOTSW and this one is definitely one of the best.  To folks who have not watched this show before please give it time.  At first you may be put off or bored but the show grows on you and then you are hooked.

Excellent set and well worth the price.",1300147200,3,1806,4.428571428571429

3285614,5,B0010V4VK8,"Just finished watching all three discs in this series of Summer Wine, and I found it to be one of the funniest (I own all of the sets released so far). The movie ""Uncle of the Bride"" introduces us to the Seymour character, and as another reviewer stated he takes a little getting used to. I found him somewhat annoying and over the top in the movie, however, as the series progresses the writer apparently decided to soften the harsher edges and Seymour definitely grows on you, and I actually now prefer him to the Foggy character.

Quite a few of the wonderful supporting characters play a larger role in this series, and it's wonderful to watch these so very talented actors.  Of course, Nora Batty is one of my favorites, as is Ivy.  Just priceless.  The Edie character displays many of the same traits (though not quite as objectionable) as Hyacinth Bucket of Keeping Up Appearances, also written by Roy Clarke, and it's hilarious to watch and mentally compare them.  And of course the beautiful Yorkshire countryside makes me to want to go and visit there! I laughed so hard while watching these discs that my stomach muscles hurt.

Now if only the powers that be got off the dime and started releasing these wonderful sets faster and more frequently! The final show aired in August 2010, which means there are 23 more seasons of Summer Wine to be released.  Hurry it up already!",1295740800,9,1385,4.628571428571429

I stumbled onto the series a few years ago and have eagerly waited for each DVD release.  They just get better as the series progresses, but you don't have to have the whole back story to enjoy the off beat humor or the antics of the aging men that are the staples of the series.  As for me, I'm going to grab a cup of tea curl into my easy chair and enjoy a pleasent evening with my ""old friends"".

3285630,3,B0010V4VK8,"I recently purchased these comedies. Although they are funny and worth the money, they are not as good as ""Only Fools and Horses"". The pace is a bit slow and the writing is not as tight as OFH.

OFH is my all time favorite British comedy and the best written show I have seen. Each episode of OFH is fresh and the final scenes will usually have you on the floor laughing.

3285633,4,B0010V4VK8,"Like Howie I am glad to see a quicker release schedule and hope it continues.

According to information at the BBC America Shop, this is only a 2-disc set (the Amazon description claims 3) and includes the twelve Season 9 episodes listed in Howie's review, plus the 1986 New Year's special ""Uncle of the Bride"" as a ""special feature.""

The 1986 Christmas special ""Merry Christmas Father Christmas"" and the 1987 Christmas special ""Big Day at Dream Acres"" are evidently NOT included.

Perhaps they intend to release another separate Christmas specials DVD as they did with the 1978-1982 specials.

I also agree with Howie that Last of the Summer Wine is an acquired taste but worth the effort. I caught brief snippets of the series on my local PBS station for a couple years before becoming hooked. The series contains a lot of subtle but delightful nuances, note how composer Ronnie Hazlehurst often sychronizes musical instruments used in the background score to specific movements by the characters.

Episodes tend to build gradually before reaching a sudden unexpected and hilarious finish. There are also excellent examples of slapstick physical comedy. The senior citizens of Holmfirth appear to be made of very sturdy stock, they can fall from 2nd story windows, rooftops and trees and only require a little brushing off.

I gave this release 4 stars. It deserves 5 stars in my opinion but fans of Brian Wilde's character Foggy may require a little time to warm to (temporary) replacement Michael Aldridge's character Seymour.",1285891200,14,1531,5.055555555555555
3285634,5,B0010V4VK8,"It seems Amazon has combined reviews of two completely different releases.  This review is for ""Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1985.""

This one comes as hot-on-the-heels of the ""Vintage 1985"" series set as Warners has done so far with ""only"" a 4 month gap!

Here's the Press Release info on this one:

""The world's longest-running sitcom is back with more adventures from everyone's favorite geriatrics! Soon after Foggy leaves for Bridleton to inherit his uncle's business, Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge) arrives on the scene in the wake of a self-propelled wheelbarrow, the first of many wacky inventions to leap from the mind of this retired headmaster. Clegg takes Compo and Seymour on a sentimental journey to re-create the times when his old school chums would walk gates and climb trees together. Also, Compo willingly agrees to ""road-test"" Seymour's new concept of a gentleman's purse (especially as there will be real money provided in it), and Edie's days of carrying a heavy dustbin are numbered when Seymour decides to install a new waste disposal unit for her.""

This is reported to be a 3-disc set and will include the 1986 New Year's Special ""Uncle of the Bride"".  It is said to run approx. 299 minutes for 12 episodes.  But this brings up a bit of conflict.  More on that below.

So, ""Vintage 1987"" you ask?  Seems odd as the *only* episode of LOTSW to air in 1987 is ""Big Day at Dream Acres"" which is the Christmas Special from that year!  Considering the inclusion of ""Uncle of the Bride"" which is considered episode 0 of Series 9, I'm assuming this will actually be Series 9 from 1986 and have the following episodes:

Series 9, Episode 0 - Uncle of the Bride
Original Air Date - 1 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 1 - Why Does Norman Clegg Buy Ladies' Elastic Stockings?
Original Air Date - 4 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 2 - The Heavily Reinforced Bottom
Original Air Date - 11 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 3 - Dried Dates and Codfanglers
Original Air Date - 18 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 4 - The Really Masculine Purse
Original Air Date - 25 January 1986

Series 9, Episode 5 - Who's Feeling Ejected Then?
Original Air Date - 1 February 1986

Series 9, Episode 6 - The Ice-cream Man Cometh
Original Air Date - 8 February 1986

Series 9, Episode 7 - Set the People Free
Original Air Date - 15 February 1986

Series 9, Episode 8 - Go with the Flow
Original Air Date - 22 February 1986

Series 9, Episode 9 - Jaws
Original Air Date - 1 March 1986

Series 9, Episode 10 - Edie and the Automobile
Original Air Date - 7 March 1986

Series 9, Episode 11 - Wind Power
Original Air Date - 15 March 1986

Series 9, Episode 12 - When You Take a Good Bite, Yorkshire Tastes Terrible
Original Air Date - 22 March 1986

Series 9, Episode 13 - Merry Christmas, Father Christmas
Original Air Date - 28 December 1986

Series 9, Episode 14 - Big Day at Dream Acres
Original Air Date - 27 December 1987

The conflict arises as including the 2 Christmas Specials, which is necessary for the set to be called 1987, and ""Uncle of the Bride"" brings the episode total to 15, not 12.  Even if the Christmas Specials are not on the release, including ""Uncle of the Bride"" causes the announced episode count to be off!

I'll post updates as I get them but for now I'm expecting this to be what I've listed due to the ""Vintage 1987"" in the set name.

As I've said on many of my reviews of the LOTSW sets, don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to LOTSW on first viewing. This show grows on you over time. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... it was slow and seemed almost without a plot. But after watching a few more episodes I was hooked!

Now that you've moved one release a couple of months closer to the last, Warner Brothers, how about a more realistic release pace of 4-5 series a year for the longest running sitcom in the world!",1285459200,38,3864,4.4460227272727275

I put it off for a couple years because I didn't recognize the Cyril character and didn't know if I'd like it.  It turned out to be FANTASTIC but that's beside the point.  The early shows turned out to be MUCH more quick-witted and sharp than the later ones which seem pretty sedate when compared.  I don't consider the 'Sam' episode a rerun because of the different manufacturer and I'm glad to have it IN SEQUENCE.  What if the BBC had skipped it because it had been released earlier?  An equal possibly larger number of folks would be complaining that they were missing an episode or that they weren't all released in chronological order!

The three lead actors in these four specials do a good job of making you feel that you're right there with them.  If you like other greats such as : the Marks Brothers, Our Gang comedies, Abbott & Costello and the 3 Stooges, then I think you'll like these Christmas Specials.

FINALLY!!! The ""Christmas Special"" episodes are included!!

I maintain my plea to Warner/BBC:
Get on with it! At the current release rate of 2 series per year we'll see the successor to Blu-ray come to market before all series are out on standard DVD! For a program with a over 30 year run, 2 per year is entirely too slow a release rate!

Note: If Warners continues the current chronological release schedule, the next, series 9 - from 1986, should have 15 episodes if the Christmas Specials are included.  I can hardly wait!

Observasion: Why do British series from BBC/Warner cost so much per episode?!?  Based on typical American sit-com series this should go for half the current SRP.

3285667,5,B0010V4VK8,"This is laugh out loud hilarious.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves british comedy and especially for those, like me, who hope that Last of the Summer Wine continues on for many more years.  These senior-citizen/youngsters try, with some hilarious results, to relive the joy of their youthful Christmases.  I found myself laughing out loud at their antics and their wives reaction to their husbands reluctance to grow up.  I am so glad that they hold on to their quest to grow older without growing old.  This would make a wonderful, ""Christmas in July"" theme party.  Get out the olive and cheese toothpicks (Froggy's favorite Christmas recipe), the DVD and a bottle of Guiness and enjoy.",1271030400,,698,4.872881355932203
3285668,5,B0010V4VK8,"The Last of the Summer Wine: Christmas Specials is a wonderful DVD, many laughs.
I will be ordering others in this series.",1270771200,,122,4.590909090909091
3285669,5,B0010V4VK8,"This show is one of the most hilarious BBC comedies! It is a bit of an acquired taste, but it is SO worth it when  you get to know the characters and their numerous eccentricities. This is a great collection of Christmas specials that is funny whether in December or July.",1266192000,,272,4.333333333333333
3285700,4,B0010V4VK8,"If your a fan of the Last of the Summer Wine, then you are going to love this one.  I've been hoping for the some time that  they would bring out some of the Christmas Specials .At last they have given us four of them. Two of them are great, A tune on a penny wassail and Whoops.  The other two are good, just not great. A dewhurst up a fir tree and All mod conned. But if your a fan then you will enjoy all four. I would highly recommend getting Last of the Summer Wine Christmas Specials.",1261872000,21,490,3.9292929292929295
3285701,5,B0010V4VK8,"I love Last of the Summer Wine, and am excited to have another set of episodes to add to my collection.  I only wish they would release dvd's faster.  With 38 years worth of shows to see I could be an old woman before I get to see them all.",1260576000,,240,3.78
3285702,5,B0010V4VK8,"As usual, a great DVD. Shows I had not actually seen before. I just wish they would release more. There are 30yrs worth of shows!",1258329600,3,129,4.2
3285703,5,B0010V4VK8,I enjoy the British humor. I could not think of a better way to spend some holiday down time than watching these episodes of Last of the Summer Wine.,1258070400,2,149,4.172413793103448
3285704,5,B0010V4VK8,The Last of the Summer Wine series is great.  I have bought all that I can for now and am waiting for more to come out.  These men are hillarious.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.,1257638400,2,176,3.9714285714285715
3285705,2,B0010V4VK8,Last of the Summer Wine is my all time favorite. I've taped it off the TV when I was able to. I've purchased the series from England and even bought a DVD player that would enable me to watch them. The characters are always fun to watch especially in the '70s '80s and '90s when I thought they were at their peak. Some of the writing after that was a little repiticious but I didn't mind hearing it again. I am sickly and spend a lot of time in bed. This is the perfect time to have a Last of the Summer Wine marathon. :-) I miss all of those not with us any longer especially Kathy Staff but as long as the old episodes of LOTSW are around so are they.,1254355200,36,653,3.9545454545454546
3285706,5,B0010V4VK8,"I absolutely love this show. The synopsis has one error in it. The village is called Holmfirth. The mountain range is the Pennines. These lads can find more mischief to get into in a sleepy little village, it's amazing. They even manage to turn the Yuletide on it's ear. I roar with laughter every time I see them.",1252281600,13,314,4.431034482758621
3285707,5,B0010V4VK8,"I LOVE Last of the Summer Wine. Foggy, Campo, and Clegg are just hysterical. The trouble that they can find in such a small town is amazing. The character actors are great. Wish we had some decent type of TV programs like this in America. Would watch this any time it is on or if I could get more of their DVDs would buy them in a minute.",1251331200,19,338,3.985294117647059
3285708,5,B0010V4VK8,"Wonderfully warm and humorous stories about three old codgers in Yorkshire and the predicaments in which they become involved.  Beautiful scenery, too.",1243296000,,151,5.863636363636363
3285709,4,B0010V4VK8,Nice british comedy sit-com with wonderful scenery of yorkshire. Pity there are very few dvds of the series.,1242864000,,108,5.055555555555555
3285720,5,B0010V4VK8,"It took a while for the DVD to arrive, but that was due to a mix up at the U.S. Post Office.
It was a gift for my dad that was to be placed in an Easter Basket with goodies.  Because it came after Easter, I ended up giving it to him as a get well gift because he became ill a week after Easter.  We popped the DVD into the player and he was laughing out loud.  They say laughter is the best medicine, and he was back to his happy 'ol self in no time.  I plan on buying him all the seasons to enjoy.  Thank you for the wonderful humor that you bring into the lives of so many.",1242604800,,575,3.680327868852459
3285721,5,B0010V4VK8,"wonderful cant wait for more DVD', soon I hope, come on guy's more of last of the summer wine",1240358400,,93,3.9473684210526314
3285722,5,B0010V4VK8,My wife and I love this Brit Com series and to own this DVD is great,1232236800,2,68,3.3125
3285723,5,B0010V4VK8,Brilliant DVD's ---When you are feeling low get out one of these DVD'S and soon your spirits will soar. Laugh until your sides hurt.,1230336000,3,132,4.541666666666667
3285724,5,B0010V4VK8,"My family loves these good old boys.  We've enjoyed watching this series for a long time on PBS and especially love the episodes with Brian Wilde.  Are there any more ""Last of the Summer Wine"" DVDs available especially since this sitcom has been on TV for 30 years in England.  Please keep them coming!",1214265600,2,302,4.555555555555555
3285725,3,B0010V4VK8,"This is a one-disk collection of episodes beginning with the arrival of Foggy Dewhurst as Cyril Blamire's replacement.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the Vintage 1995 collection, but it has it's moments.  The quote ""It'll be dark by nightfall"" is one of Peter Sallis' throwaway lines that returns to the mind like a boomerang.",1213142400,4,325,4.785714285714286
3285726,5,B0010V4VK8,"This is great collection of shows. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been caught up in the antics of the ""Old Men' (and their wives). This comes from the era when ""Compo"" was doing crazy stunts -- as opposed to the present day shows where the remaining actors are showing their age somewhat and being more restrained than they are on this CD. It was great to see ""Foggy"" enter the show and begin to develop his character. In short, I can't wait for more releases.",1212710400,,469,4.340909090909091
3285727,5,B0010V4VK8,"It was wonderful to find another ""Last of the Summer Wine"" DVD. We are thrilled. Thank you so much. Amazon is the greatest and is one of the few things I recommend to friends and relatives.",1212364800,,189,4.277777777777778
3285728,5,B0010V4VK8,"It is one of the best British tv comedy series I've seen in a long time and I loved every story. I wish they would make the whole series available on DVD,I would be one of the first to buy them.",1209340800,,194,3.7560975609756095
3285729,5,B0010V4VK8,"I got this vintage 1976 set last week and I've already watched each episode at least twice.  The boys are at it again with their usual antics.  The more I watch this show the more I like everything about it - the writing, the characters, and of course the beautiful Yorkshire setting.

I have one confession.  I truly miss Michael Bates not that I don't like Brian Wilde, he is perfect.  But I miss the rapier like delivery of Bates.  Another drawback of this and the other sets that I own is that there are no inserts in the DVD packaging giving some more information like dates when the episodes were shot etc.

When is BFS Video going to wake up and produce a full set of DVDs for the American market akin to say the sets for ""Are you being served?"".  Please guys get to it!

An absolutely delightful series.",1209254400,33,811,4.317880794701987
8238580,5,B0010V4VK8,I love every Summer wine DVDs I get.,1525305600,,36,3.625
8238581,1,B0010V4VK8,Both dvds i ordered do not work correctly. Will not even load on my DVD player and on my computer they play about five minutes of each episode and then quit playing,1524873600,,164,4.15625
8238582,5,B0010V4VK8,Love this show and this is a fun one,1522800000,,36,3.111111111111111
8238583,5,B0010V4VK8,There should never be a Last summer wine,1522713600,,40,4.125
8238584,5,B0010V4VK8,"Love the show but the"" Laugh track"" on it is really unnecessary and annoying.",1522368000,,77,4.571428571428571
8238585,5,B0010V4VK8,I think this is the best season of last of the summer wine i have purchased yet. Nothing quite comes close the nostalgic feeling of soft British humor. And god rest Peter Sallis. this show just wouldn't be the same without him.,1520121600,,227,4.428571428571429
8238586,5,B0010V4VK8,Great show when you watch a few and follow the different characters. While it sometimes appears stupid it is a funny take on village life with primarily pensioners.,1520121600,,164,4.892857142857143
8238587,5,B0010V4VK8,Gift to friend. He liked it,1520035200,,27,3.6666666666666665
