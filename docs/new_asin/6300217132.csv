7806485,5,6300217132,"This was the video that taught me how to quick smoking, circa 1992. It was produced in 1986 and the lessons still hold up today. I've requested permission from the American Cancer Society to distribute this online, but have not received permission yet. I likely won't, but if you can get your hands on this video, I hope it helps you as much as it helped me. I've been smoke from for over 24 years now. This includes information on all sorts of addiction, not just cigarettes. It was these lessons that allowed me to quit, the knowledge of how addiction works.",1458000000,,560,4.5
7806486,5,6300217132,"30 years ago at age 28 I had been smoking for over ten years, my wife brought home a tape and I thought ""What the hell, I'll give it a shot."" Previous attempts had failed and I thought smoking was permanently part of who I was. Because cheating wasn't something I wouldn't do I didn't believe I would be able to follow the recommended on and off procedure and eventually would skip ahead just because I knew I could but I didn't. Every day I would religiously turn off the tape at the required time and wait till the next day to revisit Robert Klein without sneaking a peak into tomorrow's segment, it worked. I know it worked because 30 years later I have not smoked another cigarette. For this I will always be grateful and to this day whenever I see Robert Klein in a movie or on tv, I tell anyone in the room, ""That's the man that helped me quit smoking,"" even if they heard me say it a hundred times before.
