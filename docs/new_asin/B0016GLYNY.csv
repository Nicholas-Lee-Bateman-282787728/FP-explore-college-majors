8262323,5,B0016GLYNY,"Hang on tight, this is a full body and mind dive into diverse melodic and rhythmic music!  Percussion, keyboards, strings, electric and stand-up bass all combine for a tasty melange that is better experienced than described!  If you like fusion, rock, jazz, classical, tango, or all the above, then you'll find something to enjoy hear ;D Top notch playing and creativity all around!  Great bonus features too, including much extra music. All together an awesome bunch of music!",1321056000,,477,5.089743589743589
8262324,5,B0016GLYNY,What a great DVD! My only complaint is that I wasn't at the show. Terry Bozzio's fantastic playing with a incredible string group is so great that words cant describe it. It must be seen to be believed.,1233964800,4,202,4.342105263157895
