8754048,5,B01CRXR924,"Cliff Richard is as good as his last song from his ""Reunited"" Concert with the Shadows to celebrate their 50th Anniversary together in 2009.  For this concert to celebrate his 75th birthday at the Royal Albert Hall in 2015,  he has not missed a beat.  His voice is as great, as usual; he has not gotten any older (he said he'll tell us his secret to his youth when he turns 150 ).  I thoroughly enjoyed this concert.  Several songs were from the past and there were others which he recorded recently - e.g., ""Golden"". His supporting cast was as good as well.  All-in-all, what a wonderful 2 + hours of musical enjoyment.  Way to go--Cliff.  I hope you have many more birthday concerts to come!",1510617600,2,693,4.444444444444445
