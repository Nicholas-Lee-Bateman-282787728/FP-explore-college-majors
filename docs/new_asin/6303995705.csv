754464,5,6303995705,"To be honest:  I enjoyed this film.  And I concede this despite the presence of Andie MacDowell.  Ive never had any bad feelings about her until she starred in Four Weddings and a Funeral, and she was so atrocious, I couldn't help but concentrate on her acting.  I just wanted to know how bad she could be.  And with the exception of sex, lies, and videotape  she is just so bad.

This is an ensemble cast, meaning Andie MacDowell isn't the only one featured.  It was eloquently and brilliantly written, and to hate this film would discount the effort of the other good actors.

I remember particularly the actresses.

Loved Jennifer Jason Leigh, stellar as always, as the housewife who also does phone sex, making all those grunts while feeding her baby and disappointingly noting the time in her ledger.  Because it was her job to prolong the caller.

There was still the unknown Julianne Moore, who was bold and brave, and her interaction with the beautiful Madeline Stowe was so good.  The local critic (in my area) loathed Madeline Stowe, and I believed him  not realizing there might not be merit to his criticism, because I always thought she was good.  Madeline Stowe was very good here, playing the jilted wife, and I still recall the brilliant laughter of Julianne Moore as her husband saw her painting her sister naked.  Madeline was so vulnerable and seductive.  Frances McDormand, who might not even be pretty, is perfect as the mistress.

There is tragedy.  I tried to feel for MacDowells character but I always knew it was her, and I was laughing the whole time.  There were a second when she impressed me  her son was home when he wasn't supposed to be and she sang out his name in surprise  well, that caught me off-guard.  When she tried to get emotional, confronting a baker after her sons death, I thought it was hysterical, not at all sincere, and probably one of the funniest things I ever saw - because of her bad acting.  Andie MacDowell didn't ruin this film for me, but there were so many other stories, so many other actors, where thankfully, she was just buried in the mix.

Its a very good film.  Altman did a very good job.  He just lost some credibility including her two films and then ranting Hollywood.  Seriously?  He actually became the epitome of it.",1438041600,,2287,4.60545905707196
754465,4,6303995705,"I certainly liked this film, especially after a 2nd viewing.  But it's weak spots kept me from feeling it's one of Altman's very best.  There are some less than great performances in key roles -- some actors are miscast, or playing caricatures, or are just not that brilliant.  Some story lines seem facile, and the ending feels unsatisfyingly convenient and cute.

Still, there's a lot that's funny, and a lot that's moving.  It just never quite has the depth, or power or overall vision of it's earlier multi-character epic cousin, 'Nashville'.

That said, most critics and people seemed to like it even more than me, and it's well worth seeing and deciding for yourself.

754471,5,6303995705,"I haven't read much by Raymond Carver, but I think this movie succeeds on its own terms. It's beautifully shot--especially the helicopter/crop duster scenes at the beginning--and it has a stellar cast giving their best for director Robert Altman.

If you've seen other Altman movies--especially Nashville--you'll feel completely at home. The running time is 3 hours, but it doesn't seem like it. The multiple plot lines are diverse but never sprawling. The dead, drowned girl introduced at the beginning is supposed to become a symbol of death-in-life throughout the movie but that symbolism never drowns the movie.

The plot about Lori Singer as a cellist in a difficult mother-daughter relationship was a highlight of the film to me. There is one moment in the film when she embraces Andie MacDowell after MacDowell's son has died. In that embrace, Singer feels the love MacDowell has for her son that she herself has never felt from her own mother. Or at least that's how I see it.

My point is, faults notwithstanding, Short Cuts is an excellent movie about relationships and individual epiphanies. For the most part, it is uncluttered and very realistic in its avoidance of melodrama and easy resolutions to the mysteries of human behavior.",1408924800,,1245,5.0634146341463415

754602,3,6303995705,"This one hasn't stood the time-test.  What passed a few decades back as a quirky, parallel-plots meander through the lives of about a dozen and a half medfly-era Southern Californians now comes off as strained and naive.  ""Short""'s clever admixture of interesting themes (narcissism, fidelity, paranoia, forgiveness) and sad-sack character types (sexist rednecks, beleaguered wives, soulless cynics, kids caught in adult crossfire) can't survive implausibilities built into the script.  Why does a philandering, abusive traffic cop suddenly become a cuddly family guy?  Why does his seemingly intelligent wife even wait for his credulity-killing change?  Why do grieving parents, stalked and tormented by a psychotic baker, suddenly decide to break fresh bread with him?  What unseen epiphany makes him - instantaneously - want to share (instead of start) other people's suffering?  Is it that they've all read the you're-kidding-me script?  You'll wonder what active ingredient in chopper-dropped pesticide turned these creepy 80s Angelinos into saints.  The all-star cast (including Madeleine Stowe, Tim Robbins, Matthew Modine and Lily Tomlin) is fun to watch, and hazy-sunny LA looks ageless and sexy as ever.  Writer/director Robert Altman's reputation for life-slicing genius is intact - but ""Short Cuts"" takes too many manipulative detours to be a compelling trip.",1397347200,3,1371,5.70935960591133

754683,5,6303995705,"Based on nine stories and a poem by the late Raymond Carver, Short Cuts is a deeply realistic, broadly written, stunningly structured jazz mural of a city on the edge.

The stories, fused together so seamlessly by Altman, were conceived separately by Carver, and only one was invented for the film (a tragic duet between Annie Ross as a drunken, dying jazz singer and Lori Singer--who does her own playing--as her classical cellist daughter). Only two of the tales are in a form fairly close to Carver's. Those are the stories based on ""A Small, Good Thing"" (about a baker who harasses a couple who haven't picked up their son's birthday cake, unaware that the boy lies comatose after a car accident) and ""So Much Water So Close to Home"" (about three fishermen who won't let the discovery of a nude female corpse disrupt their fishing vacation).

Originally, there were no links among the tales, other than thematic ones--Carver's sense of modern urban isolation, the misunderstandings, petty cruelties, and sad silences. So Altman and co-adapter Frank Barhydt, Jr., made the links and found the short cuts. The ensemble is large: pool cleaners and TV commentators, waitresses and jazz singers, limo chauffeurs and conservative doctors, phone-sex specialists and cake bakers, makeup artists and fishermen. Altman and Barhydt (and editor Geraldine Peroni) concentrate entirely on transitions, leaping from one track to another, making connections between the clusters of characters (think PT Anderson's Magnolia).

Part of the greatness of the film, which is one of the triumphs of recent American film-making, lies in Short Cuts's recognition that nothing in life is ever resolved, that there are not only no happy endings, but virtually no endings at all.",1359244800,,1756,5.176056338028169

754687,4,6303995705,"Criterion's release of what is considered one of Robert Altman's masterpieces finally allows me to discard my 2 VHS tape set acquired years ago.  There is no question that Altman is the go to guy when it comes to long intricate collages of individual stories. ""Nashville"" is considered one of the great movies of all time.  ""Popeye"" not so much.  Here Altman takes an unconnected set of short stories from Raymond Carver and blends them into a coherent, if complex film. The film is buoyed by a great soundtrack featuring Annie Ross's Jazz ensemble and Lori Singer's string quintet.  An extensive list of ""A"" list actors of the time allow themselves to be manipulated by Altman who evidently encouraged them to improvise along the way.  None are bashful.  The language is course and there's nudity aplenty.  Surprisingly it's not very titillating and seems natural for the scene.  At the same time, it must have taken courage for Julianne Moore to rattle off a long diatribe against her husband's infidelity accusations while standing in all her red full frontal glory.  Ultimately the 9 different story lines work in spite of some preposterous premises.  For example.  It's hard for me to believe that a professional phone sex operator working from home would do it in front of her young children.  Maybe I'm just nave.  In the final chapter we see one character, bludgeon to death a young woman for no apparent reason.  Then it's covered up by her companion.  Huh?  In the end we have a set of 20 plus main characters who are not very likeable and for the most part don't like each other or the lives they have.  Then magically in the final scene all seems well with the world.  This is a terrific film but falls short of masterpiece status.  Altman's own ""Nashville"" and ""Gosford Park"" probably fall into that category. The Criterion transfer is well done as usual.",1319500800,,1868,4.7632398753894085

754773,2,6303995705,"Something about Robert Altman's films has always left me cold - whether from early in his career with 'Mash', or else later, as in 'A Prairie Home Companion'.  That was one of the reasons I skipped 'Short Cuts' when it first came out - only recently another reviewer reminded me that this was based on Raymond Carver's short stories, which I'd read since the film's release, so I put aside my initial hesitation and plunged in.

And a long plunge it is - at just over 3 hours, you may want to pack a lunch for this one.  But length alone wouldn't capsize this film - I'll gladly watch even longer films when I think they warrant it.  What it is that sinks this film is one of two things: either the poor acting showcases the screenplay problems, or else the butchering of Carver's stories in the screenplay promotes the wooden performances of a high-profile group of actors.  In fact, it is surprising to me that this film garners much praise at all.

Leaving aside the issue of the intent behind Carver's stories and whether that was reflected in Altman's version, many of the actors in 'Short Cuts' that I would have expected to do well - Tim Robbins, Madeleine Stowe, Angie McDowell, and even Julianne Moore to a certain extent - were simply unbelievable.  Others - Mathew Modine, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lyle Lovett - have always seemed to me to be poor actors.  Surprisingly, Lily Tomlin and Chris Penn are probably most effective here, with Tom Waits a close third (Robert Downey Jr. and Lili Taylor are good but underused).  Jack Lemmon does well with what he's given, but even that comes at the expense of the other storyline he's involved in (I would also say that Lemmon's monologue matches Carver's intent very well, with Tomlin and Waits right behind).  The unfortunate side of all of this is that even if Altman had a divergent view of Carver's stories, I could never get into it.  Instead of immersion into the world of the director, every time Modine, Robbins, McDowell or Stowe came onscreen, I was thrust out of the film back into the role of disbelieving observer.

One thing I enjoyed about Carver's fiction was that, no matter how he resolved his stories, he somehow revealed the flawed humanity behind his characters, and at the same time revealed his sympathy for them.  As I said before, Jack Lemmon's character, admitting his decades-old infidelity, seems to come closest to the feelings I had reading Carver's stories, even though I haven't read the particular story that vignette was based on.  And except for Tomlin and Waits, none of the other storylines reach the peculiar empathy level Carver infused in his writing.  Some, in fact, seem to veer off into the exact opposite intention, as if Altman wanted to say something about the shallow, superficial and melodramatic life of L.A.  That life undoubtedly exists, but this film isn't convincing in its portrayal of it.  Instead it unspools vindictively, as if the director had a bone to pick with the city, and in order to get his point across, has his actors over-emote to really get at the rotteness of L.A.  Why else would the viewer be treated to the extremely realistic, if not actual, long shot of Huey Lewis urinating, complete with all necessary equipment for the procedure shown, unless Altman, a professional director, thought it somehow added to the film?  Subconscious or no, I'm tempted to say it's a statement of sorts, one that reflects poorly on the film and the director.",1278892800,4,3466,4.737104825291182
754774,5,6303995705,"What do I admire most about this film? I would say: the technical brillance of the script (and the editing!) which combines about 8 Raymond Carver short stories to a long (3 hours) mosaic of story puzzle pieces. Next the fact that Altman assembled a large cast of outstanding actors for mostly smallish parts.
I am not normally much of a short story reader, and reading Carver did not do all that much for me when I tried it, but in Altman's monster-combo they come to life. I watched the film now for the third time in 15 years, and I was a bit apprehensive whether I would still agree with my memory, but I do: this is one of Altman's best!
This is LA in the early 90s. We have an insect pest invasion, an earthquake, a family tragedy with a little boy hit by a car, a bunch of guys finding a dead woman when they go fishing, a woman making her living by telephone sex while tending to her little children, a woman juggling her lovers and her stalking ex, a mean cop taking the little dog away from his screaming brats, a pretentious female painter and her jealous husband, a woman earning her living as a clown while her husband is unemployed, a couple taking care of their neighbors' house in less than responsible manner, a couple living and drinking and splitting and re-uniting in a trailer, a heartless aging jazz singer and her emotional cellist daughter...

754775,5,6303995705,"Short Cuts is a typical Robert Altman film. It involves a large ensemble cast (in this case 22 characters) and a high degree of interaction between crew and cast. It is the 25th of Altman's 34 feature films beginning with Mash in 1970 and ending with A Prairie Home Companion in 2006, which makes him one of America's most prolific directors.
Altman's directing style is in sharp contrast to that of Stanley Kubrick, arguably America's greatest film director. Kubrick was so disillusioned after making Spartacus in 1960 that he moved to England to get away from the American studio system, which gave producers the right to make the final cut of the film. Beginning with Lolita in 1962 and ending with Eyes Wide Shut in 1999 Kubrick made eight films in England, all of them masterpieces. During a comparable period, Altman made a total of 34 feature films. Not all were masterpieces, but many were great successes, including Short Cuts.
From Kubrick we expect perfection. From Altman we expect a bit of anarchy. There is more of a democratic process with Altman as well as the feeling that anything can happen.

I watched this film because the concept of ensemble casts and multiple storylines appeals to me (for some reason I can't fully explain) and I left the film relatively pleased; sure Andie McDowell isn't a great actress, sure there isn't really any deep material in the film, sure the thread with Lily Tomlin is uninvolving, and sure I'm sure it isn't Magnolia, but if you're just looking to kill 180 minutes without getting bored it'll work just fine.

I've waited several years to watch it, and now that I have seen it, I honestly don't knwo what kept me waiting so long! I loved it! It's funny, bittersweet, and heartbreaking. The acting from the entire ensemble is amazing, and the direction is flawless. I love Altman's style. He's not so concerned with flashy camera tricks and techniques. He simply sets the camera up, and lets his actors act. The editing is seamless. You'd think that this film would be an editor's nightmare - and it probably was - but lots of effort obviously went into the film. You can most definitely call it a labor of love from everyone that was involved. It just inspires and amazes me to know that Robert Altman had this much ambition when he put together this project. With some directors, after they reach a certain age, they slow down and take on smaller projects. Not Altman. This film was a landmark, and inspired another great film of the nineties, MAGNOLIA. The films couldn't be more different, however there are a few notable similarities. Some have called MAGNOLIA a rip off of SHORT CUTS, and I'd have to disagree. Aside from that, I think that it is a wonderful film that every film buff should see. I am glad that I finally got to view it in it's entirety.

Though I  hadn't seen it since then, certain images remained stuck in my mind:  the angry betrayed spouse, the phallocratic policeman, the promiscuous divorcee, the parents in tragedy at the baker.  Extremely vivid personalities, all subtly linked by chance, who reveal the drama of their lives as the viewpoint flits from one to the other.  Now, seeing it for the first time since then, the film totally satisfied yet again - indeed, it is so intricate that I know I can watch it many many times for nuance.

The performances are universally stunning, vignettes by truly great actors, who can summarize an entire life, even an entire environment and time, in a few gestures.  Every single group faces some sort of fundamental upheaval over a weekend, in LA of the 1990s.  It is mostly about terrible loss, though some survive and simply go on.  I empathized with every single person and imagined where they went from there, like they entered my imagination, as they did the first time I saw it.

754847,3,6303995705,"Short Cuts, the three plus hour long film written and directed by Robert Altman (with co-writer Frank Barhydt), based upon a series of short stories by Raymond Carver, is an odd film. It's not a bad film, nor is it even remotely a great film- the only two sorts of films that the hit (Nashville) and miss (Vincent And Theo) Altman has plenty of experience with. The nine stories and one poem of Carver's, from the same titled anthology book, have been transplanted from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles, and many of the stories are made to cross over with each other, where they were unconnected in print, as well from different story collections, with several characters being based upon more than one character to help achieve that end. The problem is that the film loses focus when it centers on lesser written tales, which Altman does not make better, and on some tales which he actually makes worse. There are ten stories and two dozen characters that fill the screen, and a plenum of human melodrama, drama, and darkness fill the screen: joy, sadness, jealousy, fear, reconciliation, pain, infidelity, and death- accidental, murder, and suicide are among them.
  The quick moving vignettes are so filigreed that to do justice to each would take far too long, but most work well, until it comes to their resolutions.... Short Cuts is a film almost wholly devoted to the written word, as all great films are, but its `little above average' goodness, rather than greatness, stems from the fact that the words of Carver- as hit and miss in prose as Altman is on film, are never allowed their full power nor poesy. Despite what others have said, Carver was no minimalist. Becekett was a minimalist. Carver was merely lean in his prose- which is not synonymous with minimalism, but he was rich in characterization and `moment'- at his best. This film never quite finds that groove. It is like 85% of the way to an orgasm, but the result is that its wad is never shot, although its member ripens. This impotence comes not only from the screenplay's flaws, but from the anomic cinematography of Walt Lloyd- who will have no one comparing him to Sven Nykvist, and the off the rack musical scoring of Mark Isham.
  There is also much pointless nudity in the film- mostly female, which has led feminist critics to damn the film. Usually, their critiques are downright silly- and vapidly lead them to stick out their tongues and call Carver a `misogynist', or worse. He's not, clearly, but as the nudity is pointless- such as a muff shot of Julianne Moore cleaning wine from her dress as she fesses up to her infidelity, why is it included? Is her orange pubic hair so greatly symbolic or ironic? No. Is it realism? Perhaps, but it is `cheap realism'. Marketing is a more likely and truthful reply. Yet it is the `real realism' of the film that is mother to its best moments, little moments like Paul Finnigan's egg trick, Claire Kane's pretending to sign the guest book at the funeral of the dead girl her husband had no compassion for, or the humorous photo mixup where Gordon sees the photos of a `dead' Honey that Bill staged, and Honey and Lois see the photos of the dead girl in the river that Gordon also did not empathize with, which lead both parties to memorize the others' license plates in order to report them to the police. That the `real reality' of this work of art is so few and far between, and leads to its diminution, one wonders what a good dollop of, say `real fiction' may have added? A little more Carver and a little less `tang may have been the best and shortest cut this film had to greatness.",1221696000,,3618,4.604651162790698

There are individual moments of acting brilliance, especially the Jack Lemon confession scene, and the stilted but entertaining interplay by Tom Waits and whats her name from Saturday Night Live. There's some full frontal nudity, rare for a Hollywood creation. The soundtrack is great, with original tunes by Dr. John sung by the jazz singer Annie Ross, who also acts well here. Carver was hot stuff in the late 80s and early 90s, but you don't hear much about him any more. That doesn't mean his stories weren't good.

754850,5,6303995705,"One of the greatest compliments you can give to any film done by Robert Altman is that they perfectly represent real life.  Nothing about his films are glossed up as is the fashion of almost anything in Hollywood.  Every frame and every character has this rich sense of humanity and raw realness that drips from their every move.  Even when the situations are less than normal the human reactions to them are so natural that one can't help but relate.  `Short Cuts' has been lauded as Altman's finest work, and even though I can't say that I have seen everything he's done I can honestly say that of what I have seen `Short Cuts' is by far the grandest.  Every single frame is flawlessly constructed and leads beautifully right into the next.

That's actually in all probability the greatest compliment you can give to any director.

`Short Cuts' intersects between the lives of about eight families, all who live within the same town and all who are connected in one way or another.  Each family and their personal lives are exposed with such blunt realism that it never really feels like we're watching a movie but more like we are sitting in their living room watching them simply live.  When Julianne Moore's character Marian stands in her living room without any pants or even underpants on and yells at her husband for quite some time we get a glimpse of acting without restraint, acting without boundaries; in other words we get to see these actors transcend the chains of `acting' and we watch them become their characters.  These actors are so comfortable within the realms of their performances that they come off as normal everyday people going about their normal everyday lives.  There is not a single hint of discomfort or hesitation.

The families who we are introduced to all have their own set of very unique problems.  Marian and Ralph Wyman are struggling to stay interested with each other.  They find themselves quarreling over just about anything, yet neither of them can seem to pinpoint where it all went wrong.  Claire and Stuart Kane meet the Wyman's at a concert and instantly strike an acquaintance that turns into an obligatory dinner invite that both couples (at least both husbands) begin to dread.  Claire Kane finds herself being pulled over by Officer Gene Shepard, who proceeds to ask her out.  Gene is married (unhappily) to Sherri who happens to be Marian's sister.  Gene is also dating Betty Weathers who is separated from her possessive husband Stormy.  Then you have Ann and Howard Finnigan who find themselves in a horrific situation when their young son is hit by a car on his way home from school.  The woman who hit their son is Doreen Piggot.  Doreen finds herself questioning her life choices after she nearly kills this young boy and she confides her feelings to her daughter Honey.  Honey is married to Bill, who happens to be best friends with Jerry Kaiser who cleans the Finnigan's pool.

Add to this already elaborate mosaic a murdered young woman and the apathetic reaction from the men who find her and you have one of the most alarming and unsettling character studies in recent memory.

But, like I mentioned, it's the realistic approach taken by the actors that really elevates this film.  To discuss every performance would really be tiresome to the reader, not to mention to myself, but there are a few standouts that I think deserve special mention.  Fred Ward, who plays Stuart Kane, shows plenty of depth in character, especially when he and some fishing buddies find the murdered young woman.  His reaction not only to the discovery but also to his wife's reaction to his insensitivity radiates through the screen.  Both Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell are amazing as the Finnigan parents.  There situation is the most unnerving and heartbreaking and so we are instantly drawn to them but the way each actor handles their characters with realism is beyond words; especially MacDowell who slowly unravels before our eyes.  As good as they are, Jack Lemmon is even better.  Lemmon plays Howard's estranged father who hears of the accident and decides to drop by the hospital to get reacquainted.  He speaks volumes with his eyes and movements and overall approach that I was moved to tears.

`Short Cuts' truly changed my mind about a certain actress that I find myself putting down quite a bit; Julianne Moore.  Her riveting portrayal of Marian Wyman is so natural and so real that I am quick to label it best in show.  I have always found Moore to be a very mannered actress, one who always appears to be acting.  This works in her favor in films like `Far From Heaven', but in most of her work I think it works against her.  Here she has cast aside all of those mannerisms and acts splendidly natural, so much so that I couldn't believe she was the same actress I had seen so many times before.

The rest of the cast is amazing as well, from Lilly Tomlin to Chris Penn to Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tim Robbins and Lili Taylor and Madeleine Stowe and Robert Downey Jr. and Frances McDormand and even Peter Gallagher (although his character repulsed me).  Lyle Lovett has a controversial role in the film, and Annie Ross and Lori Singer play mother and daughter musicians (mother sings, daughter plays cello) who have a very stirring and emotionally complicated sub-plot (the only story arc of Altman's own imagination; not drawing any inspiration from Raymond Carver's short stories).

In closing I feel compelled to implore you to watch this movie as soon as you can, if you have not already.  There are few films that paint life so realistically, without sugar coating and without dramatic reinterpretation.  Everything presented in `Short Cuts' is `as is' so-to-speak, reaching further into our hearts and souls because every word spoken and every action taken is as if we ourselves had spoken or taken them.  `Short Cuts' is a story about life told as if it had really been lived.",1218412800,3,5946,4.765625

754949,5,6303995705,"""Short Cuts"" is a film by Robert Altman, but it's not a film that you hear mentioned a lot when his work is brought up. Even though it's in The Criterion Collection, you don't hear a lot of people talking about it. Sad, since it's a really good movie. I didn't know anything about the film before seeing it, except I knew that it was an ensemble film that was more than 3 hours long (the credits start a 184 minutes). To me, that sounded overly long...So when I began watching the film I was a little skeptical. Having finished it, I want to tell you that I've seen movies that were 90 minutes long that went by slower than this did. This is not a perfect film, but it has characteristics that could make it one. For example; In 184 minutes, there is never a wasted scene. There is no scenes that could be cut completely from the film without affecting the outcome. It's made in a way where every scene is pivotal. The movie is broken into several different stories (cuts), which are based on the writings of Raymond Carver. One of the storys is about Ann Finigan (Andie MacDowell) and her husband Howard (Bruce Davison), who's son has just been hit by a car. Although he quickly got up and walked home after the accident, he is quickly hospitalized for internal injuries. As they're at the hospital, Howard is reunited with is father Paul (the late, great Jack Lemmon); Who makes some shocking revelations. The next involves Marian Wyman (Julianne Moore) and her husband Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine, far away from ""Full Metal Jacket"" territory here), and Ralph's insecurities about Marian's past infidelities. Then there's Lois Kaiser (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Jerry Kaiser (the later and underrated Chris Penn). Lois is a home-phone sex operator and Jerry is a pool cleaner, who's going frustration with his wife's job will end in tragic (yet, non-cliched) results. Honey (Lili Taylor) and Bill Bush (Robert Downey Jr.), who are house-sitting an apartment for a couple for free. Sherrie Shepard (Madeleine Stowe) and her husband Gene (Tim Robbins), a cop who's having an affair with Betty Weathers (Frances McDormand). Betty's husband Stormy Weathers (Peter Gallagher) senses his wife is having an affair, which will end in hilarious results. There's a whole array of other characters as well. Some of the stories are intertwined, some are not...One film that popped into my head throughout my viewing of this movie was ""Magnolia."" I want to say right now, if you didn't like Magnolia. You probably will not like Short Cuts. If you didn't like Magnolia solely because of the frog thing, then you might like this movie. They're both simalar no doubt. They even end in a simalar way. Magnolia ended with frogs, Short Cuts ends with an earthquake. The movie perfectly blends it's subtle comedy and drama and give it's huge cast of actors opportunities to show off. None of the actors are weak in their roles...In fact, actors I've considered weak in the past come off quite strong in this movie. I've seen a lot of ensemble movies in my time and there's been times where I've wanted to see one side of the story more than the other (the Philip Seymour Hoffman aspect in ""Happiness"" for example). In this film, each storyline is just as interesting and entertaining as the previous one (especially the one involving a dead body that I forgot to mention). The movie won't appeal to everyone for a number of reasons; It's running time, it's subject matter, it's style. I thought it was a terrific film. This is the first movie I've seen by Robert Altman and I gotta say. If any more of his movies are like this, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more.

754950,5,6303995705,"Robert Altman's three-hour paean to life in early 1990's Los Angeles is an exercise in required patience, but having sat thru it more than once, I can tell you, it is a rewarding film that represents a master at work behind the camera and a burgeoning and talented cast of actors telling complex, interwoven stories before it. Short Cuts, as an homage, is the kind of film that both grows on you and also the sort where the more often you watch it, the more you see things you missed. Presenting a cross-section of life in Los Angeles over a few days' time, Altman and original writer Raymond Carver craft plotlines that converge and blend and diffuse until what had begun as a half-dozen distinct stories become in essence one, revealing to us by degrees the connections these seemingly disparate people share. This is a risky storytelling technique also used to great effect by Pulp Fiction in 1994 and more recently by the makers of Crash. Altman here tells stories about feuding couples, of suburban paranoia, of a sexually-apathetic phone-sex working housewife, of a little boy hit by a car on his birthday, of a womanizing police officer who can't keep his joie de vivre zipped up, of a group of buddies who discover a submerged body in a stream while fishing, and several other tales, none presented in linear fashion and none standing alone. This film makes use of what comes within a (red) hair's breadth of gratuitous nudity, all of it female, some of it full-frontal, and the dialogue is  riddled with obscenities, often used so colorfully you sense they are intended as a parody of the modern-day American language. Short Cuts roils to a conclusion that more or less ties all the loose ends together, links the major players, and answers questions, all in the face of a Monday morning earthquake that is almost severe enough to be the proverbial ""big one"" Californians have dreaded for decades. Short Cuts is truly funny in a few places, as well as sad, disturbing, and frustrating. I recommend watching it in one sitting, because not only is this obviously its intended format, but if you do you'll emerge feeling as if you've  come to deeply know this cast of characters since you've just spent the past several days in the thick of their often unpleasant yet somehow alluring private lives.",1159401600,7,2305,4.76
754951,5,6303995705,"When Altman is good he's among the greatest, and SHORT CUTS is among his best (M*A*S*H, BREWSTER McCLOUD, NASHVILLE).

Adapted from Raymond Carver's collection of stories, SHORT CUTS offers a roving, restless glimpse into the lives of several Los Angelinos. The characters aren't completely real - in an 'I-can-relate-to-these-people' sense (I never expected that from this movie anyway), but are presented in a slightly hyperreal sense with Altman highlighting the everyday lives of characters who try valiantly to maintain their public personas (cutting across class boundaries in the process), even when things are spinning out of control beneath the surface (literally symbolized by the ending, though at least he didn't stoop to throwing in a rain of frogs...).

Los Angeles is famously mocked as a place that's all surface and no depth (see ANNIE HALL), and the slight exaggerations seen here characters play with this stereotype, even as the isolation and instability of certain characters humanizes them. Through it all there's plenty of humor - though, as is usual with Altman, even the humor packs a wallop. Annie Ross' deadpan complaint gets to the heart of it all: ""I hate L.A. - all they do is snort coke and talk."" The irony in such nastiness becomes a bit more apparent when you consider who that assessment is coming from; within Altman's tragi-comic variant upon the notion that California's trends (the allegedly leftist paradise that also gave us smog, gridlock, tax revolts, megachurches, extremely unaffordable housing and a right-wing president who was forced to resign in disgrace) become everyone else's truisms a decade or two down the road.

There are so many great moments here - Chris Penn's growing befuddlement (and seething, simmering murderous anger) with his wife's phone sex operator job; Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin as a boozy working class couple; Peter Gallagher and Frances MacDormand's marriage, collapsed into tantrums and furniture vandalism; the Tim Robbins/Huey Lewis confrontation; Jack Lemmon, Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine all deliver strikingly memorable performances. Every time I watch this, I get something new out of it - though it requires a bit of patience, SHORT CUTS is really worth checking out.

There's a chap you may have heard of by the name of Joe Frank. He does wonderful, hysterically strange radio dramas that will leave you bug-eyed in fascination at the sheer weirdness of the characters therein. Frank is a master at what he does.

There's another chap you may have heard of by the name of Raymond Carver. He wrote wonderful, hysterically strange short stories (and the occasional poem) that will leave you bug-eyed in fascination at the sheer weirdness of the characters within. Carver, too, was a master at what he did.

Then there is Robert Altman, who decided to take a number of the short stories in Carver's watershed book, Cathedral, and turn them into a three-hour film. The result is Short Cuts. It is neither wonderful nor hysterically strange, and while it has echoes of both the Carver stories on which it is based and the ludicrous extremes of Joe Frank, it cannot claim to achieve the mastery of either of them.

I mention Joe Frank because there are certain scenes in the movie, the occasional moment, that remind me of Frank's work. Altman is capable of achieving with visual techniques what Frank achieves with his dialogue-- the ability to make the viewer wonder what sort of insane mind could possibly put this sort of thing together. But where Frank does it on a constant basis, these moments are all too rare in Short Cuts. The rest of this far, far too long flick consists of a number of very, very good actors going through their paces in a stangely listless manor, talking a lot and not actually doing all that much. There are a few very good performances (Jack Lemmon, in a small role, stands out), but the net effect of putting together this many fantastic actors in one film is to dilute the whole.

Even if everyone here gave top-notch performances, however, it still wouldn't help. The movie just wanders, never settling on a single storyline long enough to do it justice (the obvious comparison here is to Pulp Fiction, which does that trick so well), cutting from storyline to storyline as fast and loose as Romero's Dawn of the Dead cuts between camera angles. While some of this movie is undeniably fascinating, and it's competently put together, it could have been so much better than it actually is. **",1151452800,4,2285,4.7025

That image of Matthew Modine holding that balloon and making that sound will stay in my memory the rest of my life. Not a movie for the impatient. Altman adept and even and driving it home--a director who's mastered his craft and can, every once in a while, create a true gem. There's a reason why everyone in Hollywood wants to be in one of his films when it looks like he's latched onto something good. They know they'll have a place in the film-greats history books. This may be his best. I watched it in three installments, so the length wasn't exhausting. Maybe that helps with the digestion too. Wonderfully absurd in a low key.

754998,5,6303995705,"Robert Altman is about to get an Honorary Oscar, so there is no better time to see one of his absolute greatest movies on DVD, SHORT CUTS (1993).  Altman and co-writer Frank Barhydt have taken nine stories and one poem by the great regional writer Raymond Carver.  They have mixed and matched them, then transposed the whole thing from the Pacific Northwest to sprawling Los Angeles.  The more interesting, less touristy Los Angeles.  This is close to my favorite Los Angeles movie of all time, and the author's widow thinks that Mr. Carver would love the final result.

The canvas is vast here-as always, Altman is working in Panavision 2.35, at 187 minutes, and with a cast of two dozen hand-picked actors.  The result is exciting, original, gripping, and absolutely enthralling.  The movie held me spellbound with its offbeat characters and Geraldine Peroni's miraculous editing of several plot strands together.

SHORT CUTS is not a movie for everyone.  My own mother and sister would hate it.  So let me give you a taste of what we have here.  Bruce Davison is a doctor married to Andie McDowell and with Jack Lemmon as a dad.  Their son is hit by a car on his way to school, so they stand vigil in the hospital.  And since it is the day before the kid's birthday, baker Lyle Lovett bakes him an extra special cake-then goes berserk when the cake is not picked up.  A very happy lower depths Lily Tomlin and Tom Waits live in a trailer and eat all their meals at the restaurant where Tomlin is waitress.  Buck Henry, Huey Lewis, and Fred Ward go on a fishing trip, find a nude woman's body in the water, but do not report it.  Jennifer Jason Leigh does phone sex out of her kitchen while feeding her baby and while husband Chris Penn wants to know how come she will not do that stuff with him.  He works as a pool cleaner.  Tim Robbins is a LAPD motorcycle cop married to Madeline Stowe, but having an affair with Frances McDormand.  Anne Archer is a clown for a children's party.  And Matthew Modine is married to Julianne Moore, who has a memorable frontal nudity scene when she spills wine on a party dress and takes it off to clean it.

And so it goes, slowly and meticulously for over three hours.  But it held my interest completely, and the cast is working at world-class level under Altman's inspired and improvisational direction.  If you like what I have said above, you will probably adore SHORT CUTS as much as I do.  If not...rent something else.  This is an adventurous and magnificent feast of a film that starts with medfly spraying and ends 187 minutes later with a quintessential Los Angeles earthquake that is almost over before it starts.  I loved Los Angeles when I was going to both UCLA, then USC in the 1970's.  Altman has captured its soul with a painter's eye and a poet's gift.  It is very close to his best film, and I am very happy that he is finally getting a career achievement Oscar.

The Criterion edition sells for $40, but is worth it.  The bonuses are downright awesome-a volume of the Raymond Carver stories used for the movie, a feature-length filmmaking documentary, a chat with Tim Robbins and Altman,  a PBS documentary on Carver, a BBC documentary on the screenplay, audio interviews with Carver before his untimely death of cancer, and a look at the marketing of SHORT CUTS.  Do them the night before you watch the movie, and try to watch the huge movie in one sitting.  Happy viewing.",1139961600,15,3433,4.55718954248366

I don't usually compare films with the books they are based on, but for this I'll make an exception. It was terrible. I felt embarrassed that I'd deceived my friends so badly, and they couldn't understand why I'd wanted to see this mess. Altman managed to erase everything that is great in Carver's writing, and retain everything that is dull, ordinary and boring. Actually Carver is never dull, ordinary or boring. I couldn't believe it, but I'm glad to see several reviewers agree. Altman seems to have no sensitivity whatsoever to Carver's particular genius.  What is truly amazing is that those reviewers who have NOT read Carver seem to think the film is good! This is a very puzzling situation.",1135123200,8,846,4.794520547945205

As Criterion is the only studio to releasing the extrodinary film, it didn't take much to satisfy me. The dvd (as are most criterion dvds) is approved by the director Robert Altman. If anyone else is releasing this film (which is highly unlikey) will NEVER top this.

First off, the new high-def transfer is great. Supervised by editor Geraldine Peroni and approved by Altman.

An excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack mix. An isolated soundtrack also.

An informative, yet a bit boring conversation between Altman and Tim Robbins. I'm not complaining because there is NO SUCH THING AS A BAD EXTRA FEATURE!

Luck,Trust,and Ketchup: Robert Altman in Carver Country,A great documentary on the making of Short Cuts. Maybe one of the best movie docs I've seen on a dvd. I believe it was made during the filming of the movie(maybe because the vhs quality of it).Mind-Bogglingly(I hope thats a word) extensive. 90min

To Write and Keep Kind, a PBS documentary on the life of Raymond Carver. It's O.K. almost irritatingly informative,but good.

a look inside the marketing of Short Cuts,deleted scenes, one hour audio interview  with Altman, a clip from a BBC show tracing the screenplay.

755002,5,6303995705,"The Criterion Collection DVDs always have one trick or another up their sleeve to make you certain you must spend at least $30 on a movie you remember having an impact on your life, and on Short Cuts, they give you exactly what you want.  The (it should be said, beautifully decorated) set comes with the 8 short stories and one poem that were transferred into 9 of the 10 stories that make up Short Cuts wide maze of characters and arcs.  Doing so does a great service to both Short Cuts and the Raymond Carver stories, not because Short Cuts necessarily make a definitive adaptation of Carver, but because Altman uses the stories to create a totally unique creation.  Like Coppola transferring Heart of Darkness to the Vietnam war, the context and meaning of Carver's minimalist humanity is given full vigor by everyone in the cast - unarguably one of the most thrilling acting ensembles ever assembled.  People have complained the movie feels like an endless whine about how cruel people are, but I find great hope in the bleak, unhappy, occasionally tragic, occasionally hilarious interweaving of Short Cuts - a community so cruel to each other yet so unknowingly intertwined?  The gods themselves tremble at how close these people are without knowing it, and how easy it would be to stop their fake smiles and manipulations.  That moment - if you've seen it, you know the one I'm speaking of - is a shaking alive for all of us - we're closer than we think to all just getting along.",1124841600,3,1487,4.656488549618321
755003,5,6303995705,"Having not read any of Raymond Carver's work, I will not engage the debate surrounding Robert Altman's ""accuracy"" in depicting these short stories.  I will simply comment on this film as a standalone work-something that it both has earned and deserves.  SHORT CUTS is a fascinating film, interweaving several different storylines and a heavy-hitting cast of twenty something characters in a way that communicates both the interconnectedness and haphazard nature of life.  It is wonderful to watch how pebble-sized events cause ripple effects throughout the entire ensemble, affecting the lives of everyone around them.

And the characters...rarely does a film manage to breathe so much life.  SHORT CUTS is a movie that explores our ridiculous lives: the life of a cop who is endlessly pursuing extra-marital sex, all the while his wife laughing away his infidelity and waiting for him to come running back home after a failed affair; the life of a troubled cello player, desperately seeking love & affection from her drunken, jazz-singing mother, only to resort to self-inflicted pain and mock-suicides in a vain attempt to feel something (perhaps attention); and who could forget the life of a mother working as a phone sex operator to bring in extra money, talking dirty to perverts on the phone while she changes her baby's diapers.

SHORT CUTS is an ambitious film...and it is long.  At over three hours, you have to be prepared to immerse yourself in these storylines.  While some may find trouble with the lack of a central storyline, I found the ""God's eye"" perspective to be riveting, dropping me in and out of everyone's lives and watching life ripple from the aftershocks.  A truly excellent film-I highly recommend it.",1119225600,4,1730,5.084805653710247
755004,5,6303995705,"Short Cuts works as a sequel to 'The Player'. Whereas 'The Player' was a scathing satire of Hollywood, Short Cuts moves only a few miles out from Tinseltown to expose the ordinary people of suburban LA.

The characters in this wonderfully complex and intriguing fly on the wall drama are rich and various enough to command complete attention throughout it's considerable (3 hours) length. Altman takes great delight in toying with the viewers expectations of the characters he arrays in front of them. Take the Sex-phone operator's husband (played by Chris Penn), we are invited to sympathise with his frustrations (and secretly applaud him for his tolerance) as he accepts his wifes XXX-rated day job and even tolerates the withdrawal of sex (which bores her). When he is revealed as a far more sinister deviant at the end, the irony is astonishing. Then there is the self-centred and emotionally shallow old man (Jack Lemmon)who is callous, cold and  unfeeling towards his son (Lemmons' grandson is in intensive care in hospital after a hit and run), who is more interested in his son's famous career as a TV personality and who abandons his son at the hospital when his grandson dies rather than share his son's feelings. The many ways in which the characters in the film are horrible to each other appear partly as accidental and partly stemming from deep character flaws.

The title..'Short Cuts' is very apt, the characters each take shortcuts in their lives with usually disastrous consequences, the old geezer takes an easy short cut when he walks away from his grieving son in the hospital, the Woman driver takes one when she leaves the kid to his own devices after knocking him down, the fishermen take one when they postpone the hassle of reporting the drowned corpse, the bar singer takes one when she dismisses her...'disturbed?' daughters grief over the dead child, the violinist daughter takes many...ignoring her mothers attempts to get closer to her.... then committing suicide. I secretly applauded the scene were there is a mixup at the photo-collection booth, and two characters accidentally get the other's photos, both photos depict shocking violence but as ever nothing is as it seems, their righteous indignation over what they see as they assume the worst is such a simple commendable expression of human truth.

Altman takes a group of characters and lays bare their imperfections and shortcomings, he cleverly links their stories together in a way that recalls the theory of 'six degrees of separation' as opposed to implying a special meaning to those links. There is an ambiguity to all their deeds, nothing is really good or evil, even the brutal slaying at the end has a tone of ambiguity as we are left wondering if we actually saw correctly what we think we did.",1111622400,3,2796,4.9425531914893615
755005,5,6303995705,"If you want an interpretation of Carver's stories, you may be disapointed. The film is ""based"" on the stories, it does not intend to follow them.

The result is a collage or mosaic without beginning or end, without either favorable or negative judgements on the lives and actions of its 22 characters.

All participants do an amazing acting job. If it were only for that, this movie would be great. There is much more. You will see greatness, human good and evil, innocence, and greatness. There are human emotions portrayed like in no other movie.

If for no other reason, it's worth renting it.

755006,4,6303995705,"This Criterion Collection edition of Short Cuts has everything anyone could possibly want about the movie and more...much more.  Disc One contains the movie itself, which is strangely without a commentary track.  Disc Two has all the extras - eight of them.  Instead of the Director's Track, there is a new conversation with Altman and Tim Robbins, and two additional documentaries on the making of the film.  The most valuable extras are those on Raymond Carver himself: there is a PBS documentary on his life and works, and an audio interview from 1983.

The most random extra included in this package is a paperback copy of the book Short Cuts, which is the collection of Carver's stories that Altman selected as the basis for the screenplay.  I was a little put-out by this as I all ready owned the book.  However, if you have not read the collection yet, I HIGHLY recommend.  It is incredibly illuminating to read the short stories and compare them to the finished product of the movie.  For one thing, it takes less time to read the book than it does to watch the movie.  This is a LONG film - three hours.  Ultimately, the film is more Altman's than Carver's.  It is ironic that Carver - the master of the tightly crafted short story - should be the springboard for such a digressive film.",1107302400,4,1296,4.611353711790393
755096,5,6303995705,"The ""auteur theory"", originally generated by the Fench New-Wave, is the idea that the director is THE  almost singular artist in creating the film. The director is the god, not the writer, nor the actors. He's the guy who made the film. He's the god-all-mighty for a film.

Robert Altman, widely regarded as one the most important auteur in contemporary American cinema, has actually always opposed to this idea. Though he (somehow reluctantly)  admits everything goes through his own filter, in his interviews he constantly tries to minimalize his works and to give the best credits to his collaborators.

With his 1993 masterpiece SHORT CUTS, Altman, who considers the film one of his favorites, nevertheless always has insisted that the film is not only his: Everything in the film comes from Raymond Carver, on whose 9 short stories the film is based on, the film's soul is Carver's. He also repeats that the cast (an impressive list that contains 22 great actors) is what made the film as it is.

With this director-approved DVD edition--the first, long waited entrance of SHORT CUTS to the DVD market--, Criterion came up with a very simple solution to be faithful to the director's idea: they wraped the collection of the nine stories with the DVD in the same package.

In addition, they enlarged the supplements section from their original Laser Disc edition, which already contained the making-of documentary, to introduce a wider view on the film's creation. A BBC documentary takes one of the Carver stories (the one with the cop, his wife, and the dog) and examines how it was transformed to one of the film's story. They've also put one documentary about Carver as well as an audio interview of his. Also, a glimpse on the creation of the music to which many notable musicians has contributed (U2's Bono and the Edge, Dr. John, Elvis Costello, etc) is provided with some demo-tapes of Dr. John. And to complete that, instead of just interviewing Altman, they put Altman and actor Tim Robbins (now also a fine director in his own rights) in conversation, in which Altman gladly admits the actors many contributions, like it was Robbins' idea to make Anne Archer's character a clown.

With virtually all the DVD studios immitating Criterion's long-term efforts since their Laser Disc days of adding extensive supplements and audio commentaries, Criterion seems to be challenging on a new setp: not just hailing the director=the auteur, but really getting into the creative process of a film in a sober, intellectual manner. The DVD of Renoir's RULES OF THE GAMES was a fine example, and this DVD, with apparently full collaboration and blessings of Altman is another.

The new Hi-Def transfer from the original, first-generation print is also beautifully done, and for SHORT CUTS, with it etxensive length of 3 hours and complex structure, not to forget that it is so rich with small details that one might miss at first viewing, the DVD format which permits us to watch the film repeatingly, is an ideal format. Robert Altman himself insists that, ""if you have seen my film only once... well, you haven't really seen the movie yet. You only saw the story. I make my films so that it must be seen many time if you really like it.""

One mystery is that, Altman, who has always provided audio commentary for Criterion's edition, didn't record a commentary for SHORT CUTS, though it's one of his favorites. Well, he didn't with the original Laser Disc edition either. I think I now understand why he didn't: because SHORT CUTS doesn't need an audio commentary, and also probably because he cannot, since it's also Raymond Carver's film for him. Maybe he thought putting the book with the film permits more understanding than he can ever talk about.",1106092800,9,3756,4.883830455259027

All have equal weight, but for me the most memorable is the one about a group of friends who decide to keep fishing after finding a body floating in the river.

Not exactly a dark comedy, but more a set of parables about the price paid for disconnecting from a moral imperative; i.e., choosing (knowingly or not) to sidestep authentic moral action.

A large, talented and brave cast work wonders with bold scenes that surprise with moments of accidental truth.

755099,5,6303995705,"After the critical and commercial success of The Player put Robert Altman back on the map-within the Hollywood industry-he wisely used his new found (and fleeting) cache to get a personal project of his green-lighted. With Short Cuts, he took several of Raymond Carver's acclaimed short stories and weaved an intricate tapestry of the lives of 22 different characters living in Los Angeles. Having languished on VHS for far too long, Criterion has acquired the DVD rights and assembled another definitive edition of this important movie.

Criterion has assembled an excellent package of supplemental material that is divided between the film and its inspiration, Carver's stories. In a nice touch, a book with nine of Carver's short stories and one poem is included with the DVDs.

Included on the first disc is an isolated music track that allows one to appreciate the music created for the film.

The second disc starts off with two deleted scenes and an alternate take. This includes Gene chastising his wife for smoking and Anne Archer's clown performing at a pool party.

Also included are three rough music demos of songs written by Dr. John (who also performs them) and Doc Pomus that were eventually used in the movie.

The centerpiece of this disc is the excellent feature-length documentary on the making of the movie, entitled Luck, Trust and Ketchup. There is a lot of excellent on-the-set footage of Altman working with his cast. This is a solid, in-depth look at the creative process.

""BBC: Moving Pictures"" is a BBC TV look at the development of Carver's short story, ""Jerry and Molly and Sam"" for the movie. Tim Robbins and Frances McDormand read from the actual story and talk about the movie.

""Marketing"" includes a gallery of various posters, ad campaigns, two trailers and six TV spots that show how the studio struggled with how to market this challenging movie.

""To Write and Keep Kind"" is a PBS documentary on the life and work of Raymond Carver. Friends, family and contemporaries talk about the man and his work.

""Carver Audio Interview"" is one of the few existing interviews with the man that was conducted in 1983. He talks about his life and writing.

Finally, one of the most enjoyable extras is ""Reflections on Short Cuts,"" a conversation between Altman and Tim Robbins done in June 2004 especially for the DVD. Altman talks about the creative freedom he had in the `70s. He also tells some great anecdotes in this engaging discussion.

Short Cuts was a critical darling and would later inspire Paul Thomas Anderson's magnum opus, Magnolia, a love letter to Altman's movie.

To me the film's humor is terrific. I get the feeling Altman got to do what he wanted without too many studio people telling him what to leave out. Sure, some characters are despicable, others are nervous wrecks. But some of them are nice and friendly - though often with a few hilarious ticks.
It's as if you are peeking in on parts of these people's lives - watching the mess through pink and orange sunglasses. You're involved from the first scene on, you judge and despise and you laugh until you can't no more.
And if at first you disagree with Altman's view of Carver, read the book - it comes along with the set.

755102,4,6303995705,"I watched this 10 years ago upon its first release. If i have to compare it with Altman's NASHVILLE, SHORT CUTS pales in comparison. Even back then, I thought there was something missing in the jigsaw.

10 years on, I'm thinking of buying the DVD. However, I found the laserdisc in my collection that I bought a year or so ago for next to nothing, so I gave it a spin before committing to a new purchase. The Verdict? At 3 hours long, I thought the characters should have ample space to develop. However, in most cases, they seemed cold and distance. Maybe this is L.A., and this is how the residents act. But it doesn't make a very good film. Altman's directing is certainly a hit and miss affair, and these days, they are mostly misses, no offence.

I love NASHVILLE. My life change ever since I saw it on TV when I was 14. It led me to an understanding of the world. I love Paul Thomas Anderson's MAGNOLIA, and it was THE last great masterpiece of the 20th Century. I hope Altman's films would get better somehow. Like Dr T and SHORT CUTS, and even GOSFORD PARK they drift, but don't necessarily go very far.

755103,5,6303995705,"In society, people end up with careers and lives through situational opportunity and the coincidence of chance that struck them at a sudden moment.  Short Cuts grasps this notion as a large number of characters, 22 to be precise, interact directly or indirectly through a wide variety of different opportunities and chances.  The connection is that these character's ties are of variable closeness, as some know each other, some get to know each other, and some never get to know of the existence of one another, yet every action has an effect on everyone.  It is this moment, which Robert Altman seizes, as Short Cuts becomes a tale of the little and epic episodes of life.

Robert Altman does a marvelous job in depicting the small daily deceits that are made in order to keep family life intact.  The idea is based on Raymond Carver's work which Altman freely adapts onto the silver screen, and he does a marvelous job grabbing Carver's atmosphere.  The atmosphere is of a detached society where no true values or customs exists, and only where a temporary fix can provide instant happiness.  This is supported by an excellent cast consisting of talented actors such as Andie MacDowell, Jack Lemmon, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anne Archer, Matthew Modine, Julianne Moore, Robert Downey Jr., and Tim Robbins among many others.

In the opening scene, a large number of helicopters take off into the sunset while families can hear about threats of the Medfly through a broadcaster.  The hovering sound of helicopters roams over the Los Angles urban and suburban communities as the news continues of the helicopters that are set out to spray an insecticide over L. A. in order to combat the threatening Medfly.  Fearfully, families close their windows and doors in concern of possible side effects of the insecticide.  The cinematic introduction of Short Cuts brings the audience an anxious trepidation of an unforeseen looming future, and it displays how differently people deal with the worrisome situation.

In the middle of the Medfly tragedy there are ten different stories intermingled as they all affect one another in different ways.  These stories contain love, deceit, suffering, denial, fear, envy, forgiveness, and death as the different characters explore new ways of dealing with life.  The approach used to face the difficulties of life often contain some sort of short cut, such as alcohol, infidelity, lies, and denial to provide a quick fix.  However, the short cuts taken by the people often end up being much more painful to involved parties as it does not involve taking the time to tell the truth or be frank with oneself or others.

The many tales of Short Cuts concern men such as an unfaithful police officer, three men on a fishing trip finding a dead body, a stalking baker, and a vengeful helicopter pilot.  These men often to try to express an outward masculinity, but the maleness looks feeble as they find themselves forced into a situation where they have to be nurturing and caring.  This inconsistency supports the notion that the men seek a short cut of being male by behaving in an overtly tough manner, but instead the men find themselves in a quandary as they find their wife or girlfriend upset.

The stories also have interesting quick fixes in regards to the women, who either drink themselves into oblivion or live in denial.  For example, there is the story of a jazz singing alcoholic mother that drowns her own sorrows in alcohol instead of communicating with her depressed musically gifted daughter.  There is also a housewife that runs a phone sex business while changing the diapers and feeding their infant, but when her husband wants to have some fun she is quick to remember something in order to ruin the moment.  In addition, there is the waitress who has an alcoholic boyfriend who seems to have advanced on her daughter in a moment of drunkenness to which the mother blames the alcohol.

The different stories all have something in common, as all characters avoid the truth and try to find an instant fix around the corner.  Nonetheless, the film is not about the stories, but about the people in the story and how these people deal with joy and misery from day to day while things they cannot control affect them.  Altman provides this cinematically through jumping around to the different stories while telling each tale in a disconnected manner that enhances the detached atmosphere and brings human behavior to the focus.  The behavior of the people seems to become a product of the environment and the way they have been nurtured, which gives the film some interesting psychosocial insights.

After a three hour long journey the audience will have experienced a first class venture into cinema as the tale offers several possible narrations of what happens.  This is much due to Altman and his unique storytelling, which has been seen in both Nashville (1975) and The Player (1992).  It is also a result of the brilliant performance of a magnificent cast guided into an every day rut, which many people go through.  Short Cuts will ultimately offer the viewer a fulfilling cinematic experience, which presents much contemplation upon every day behavior.",1102118400,54,5207,4.924485125858124
755104,5,6303995705,"Three and a half days in the life of Los Angeles. Tess (Annie Ross) and her daughter Zoe (Lori Singer) are a very musical family. Mother sings jazz at a seedy club where disagreeable thug Joe Robbins (Darnell Williams) hangs out boasting about his violent history and threatening people who complain about his poor manners. Zoe is only really able to communicate with other human beings in the languages of classical cello and self-harm. She gives a concert attended by Marian and Ralph Wyman (Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine) who strike up a conversation with the audience neighbours Claire and Stuart Kane (Anne Archer and Fred Ward) and end up inviting them to dinner. Claire works as a clown entertaining children while Stuart goes off fishing with his yahoo-ish friends Gordon (Buck Henry) and Vern (Huey Lewis). They find a young woman's corpse in the river but leave it there until they finish their fishing before they bother to report it. En route they had stopped off at a diner and had a good leer at the rear end of waitress Doreen (Lily Tomlin), who has a stormy marriage to Earl (Tom Waits), who is given to getting blind drunk at the same club where Tess performs. Next door to Tess and Zoe live the Finnegans, Ann (Andie McDowell) and her newsreader husband Howard (Bruce Davison), with their little boy Casey (Lane Cassidy) whose birthday is fast approaching. So Ann visits baker Andy Birkower (Lyle Lovett) to order a very special cake. But then Casey is run over by Doreen on his way to school and has to go to hospital where, just to complicate life, Paul (Jack Lemmon), Howard's long estranged, gloriously self-centred and tactless father, who cannot remember his ailing grandson's name, decides to show up on a bridge-mending mission. (After, that is, a brief flirt with Claire who is there to perform in the paediatric ward.) Meanwhile Andy the Baker is getting very aggravated by the Finnegans' sudden and, to him, unaccountable, complete loss of interest in the cake he has so painstakingly made and is now calling them about. The doctor looking after Casey is none other than Ralph Wyman and, while he is working, Marion is back home painting nudes that she thinks are `beyond natural colour' and hanging out with her sister Sherri (Madeleine Stowe). Sherri is married to oafish policeman Gene (Tim Robbins) who, when he isn't hitting on Claire under the pretext of issuing a caution for `driving too slowly', is having a torrid affair with Betty (Frances McDormand) much to the anger and distress of her husband Stormy (Peter Gallagher), a helicopter pilot working overtime due to a local medfly infestation, who has just bought her a rather lovely cake from Andy the Baker. Tess meanwhile is trying to secure the services of the Finnegan's pool-man Jerry (Chris Penn). Jerry is married to Lois (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and has decidedly ambivalent feelings about her making a living by talking dirty to men down the `phone. He is also great pals with Bill (Robert Downey Jr.), a trainee horror-movie make-up guy, who wife Honey (Lili Taylor) is the Doreen's daughter and no fan of Earl who, as does Jerry the next evening, finds himself on the receiving end of Joe Robbins' hard man routine at the club. Are you following this OK? I've really only set the stage and it gets plenty more complicated.

Altman can be a rather hit and miss director and this long movie, stitched together from materials out of Robert Carver's short stories, is definitely one of the hits. Like `Nashville' it presents a complex tapestry of a plot woven together from the intersecting lives over a few days of some 20-plus characters. (He does something similar in `A Wedding' and the later `Gosford Park' but there the intersection is effected more straightforwardly by a single social event at a single location while `Nashville' and `Short Cuts' sprawl over a whole city.) It's a style of film that is sometimes imitated (notably by Paul Thomas Anderson in `Magnolia') but nobody does it like Altman. As in `Nashville', we have brilliantly observed characters, speaking astonishing dialogue, seemingly artless but in fact gloriously considered camera movements and extraordinary effective use of music. Again as with `Nashville', the film paints a relentlessly bleak picture of human life with its parade of hopelessly hateful, damaged or just desperately unhappy people drifting aimlessly through their largely empty lives. The focus of this movie is more on relationships. In `Nashville' the typical character is desperately lonely; here we mainly encounter couples locked into marriages which, in most cases, are of a sort all to apt to make desperate loneliness seem like a good idea. I think `Nashville' the greater film, not least because of its, to my mind, significantly more effective and powerful ending, but they are both entirely exceptional.",1101859200,16,4863,4.959558823529412
755105,4,6303995705,"When I first saw `SHORT CUTS' in the theater I thought it was the funniest thing I'd seen in a while. I bought the DVD anticipating the same surge of laughter, but was sadly disappointed. I guess I've changed over time, and don't appreciate the sardonic humor this film displays. The story has some really sad moments involving death(s) and the death of anyone diminishes me these days. Maybe in my callow youth I found bitter irony amusing, but now I find it bitter. I don't know if that speaks well or ill of me, but I fail to see the humor in people hurting one another.

Based on Raymond Carver's book, which is included with the DVD, SHORT CUTS is a pun -  the film is made up of small segments of stories following the lives of a dozen or so individuals, all of whom are interconnected and many of whom commit all sorts of grievous acts over the course of several days. Some of the performances are stellar. What did it take for Juliet Moore to walk around naked from the waist down except for high heels? Andie McDowell plays her best character ever, and Peter Gallagher as Stormy Weathers is a funny tv weather guy with a grudge. Chris Penn reveals the evil side that will emerge later in Quentin Tarentino's films and Jennifer Jason Leigh is as much of a sicko as you will ever see. Years after I'd seen the film I could still remember Peter Gallagher (a fine Broadway Actor) with his dressmakers shears. Tim Robbins as a motorcycle cop is one sexy dude. The second image from the film that I retained years after I's seen it was Mr Robbins in his tight pants and tall leather boots (ala the baseball player in Bull Durham).

Many of these actors went onto stardom or fame after they made this film. I don't remember if they were famous beforehand.  It's amazing how masterfully Altman directed this ensemble composed of many of the best actors of our times. It had to be a nightmare or a joy, and the major reason to buy the DVD along with the fact that Crterion has included a second disk filled with extras.",1101600000,3,2019,4.404825737265416

The screenplay is amazing when you consider that there are so many circumstances and not one is more important than another because the film gels brilliantly as a whole. Altman's solid understanding is prevalent throughout. The acting, without exception, is first rate. It would be impossible to single out any one performance; however, Annie Ross' bluesy song stylizing was memorable, as well as Peter Gallagher's gleeful revenge against ex-wife McDormand. Jack Lemmon's ""cameo"" role was the apex of despair. These people are all haunted, in one way or another, as the stories develop: infidelity, neglect, death, misunderstandings, a sick child, negligent parents... and on and on. Altman handles each individual's reaction with generous layers of humor, pathos, discovery and total sincerity.""Short Cuts"" was at the top of every critic's Top 10, but it somewhat lost out at awards time.

Anderson must have seen this movie dozens of times before he wrote and directed Magnolia.  Altman had the moves and shows his hand while at the peak of his powers when he was making Short Cuts.  The stories are Carver's, but the film is all Altman:  from the overlapping dialog to the intercutting of multiple characters' segments.

755188,3,6303995705,"Any film buff worth their salt knows maverick director Robert Altman to be one of the most polarizing artists working in the film industry today. Often viewed as too ""artsy"" for a mainstream audience, Altman's movies typically consist of an overstuffed pastiche of lead characters (in this case, 22!), none of which take the spotlight any longer than the other. The stories sometimes intertwine, and sometimes don't, and there is a looming, often creepy realism to the actors' performances. However, these attributes can prove to be equally frustrating, as due to their lack of narrative thrust, Altman's scripts can be tedious and booring, and the meticulous crosscutting between stories more gimmicky than anything.

Never have these characteristics been on greater display than in his 1993 opus, ""Short Cuts"". Interweaving nine different stories based on the writings of short story author Raymond Carver, ""Short Cuts"" is an incredibly long collection of vignettes depicting the social mileu, ennui and day-to-day occurences of a group of Los Angeles citizens.

The stories range from interesting to downright unnecessary. Tim Robbins plays a cop who cheats on his wife and hates his family dog. To rid himself of it, he takes the dog and drops it off in a suburb somewhere. Other stories involve coping with infidelity, drunkeness, men staring at another man's wife, regret, ignorance of family, etc. One of the most fascinating stories involves a little boy who is hit by a car, then refuses to ride in a car to get help due to his being told not to speak to strangers. These coincidences seem real and eerie. They could honestly happen to anyone.

But much of the film reeks of pretense, artsy-fartsyness and force melodrama. Many character changes or actions are unwarranted, and the majority of the storylines unresolved. For example, Jack Lemmon's character appears in the middle of the film only to confess to his son how he cheated on his dead wife with his sister-in-law. Then later, he just disappears (!?!). Tim Robbin's character carries on with another woman (Frances McDormand), and then suddenly is back loving his wife, where before there was great animosity between them. Why? Why does he go get the dog? We never know. Why does Tom Waits' drunken slob suddenly decide to be Mr. Niceguy to Lily Tomlin's overworked waitress after wandering around and arguing with her for half the film? The list never ends. And since each story is only given a total of 18 minutes and the film's running time is over three hours, Altman clearly doesn't have time to flesh them out further.

This leads one to wonder why he chose to crosscut them like an ADD-plagued channel surfer. Perhaps it is that the stories, on their own, really aren't all that interesting. Characters give impromptu confessionals and monologues, both of which are overlong. Some dialogue exchanges, such as that between Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore's characters, seem soap-opera-like and forced. And what's with her extended scene of full frontal nudity?

In the end, I was both impressed, frustrated and bored by ""Short Cuts"". Altman composes some brilliant sequences and employs deft, original camerawork, but the narratives are uneven. At over three hours, the film is a serious investment of one's time. If you don't mind the absence of character arcs or large emotional payoffs, this might be for you. Personally, I enjoyed Altman's ""Cookie's Fortune"", P.T. Anderson's ""Magnolia"", and Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" much more.",1095292800,10,3513,5.102608695652174
755189,5,6303995705,"Altman's singature classic with twenty two characters and ten nearly distinct tales. Imagine the ingenuity required to interweave all of that into a seamless whole, but Altman manages the feat deliciously.
While the individual threads may coax discussion, it is their blending that enables a variety of perspectives. Most of them are poignant, for instance the life of a pool cleaner and his wife who vocalizes orgasms on the phone in her job as a tele-sex worker while changing her kids' diapers. Or the life of a couple whose son has been in a tragic accident that brings their lives to an abrupt halt. Etc.
Be warned, many of these vignettes, while very tautly scripted and cleverly screenplayed, remain ""unresolved,"" which may not work for some viewers. Personally I feel that films like this are more genuine reflections of the world in which we live: people often don't change, questions are frequently left unanswered, and unbecoming things do happen every day.
It's a pure pleasure to find a movie that weaves such a deep and intelligent tapestry of human lives, with all their idiosynchratic travails and triumphs. An absolute gem for you to own, not just rent.",1089504000,26,1170,4.944162436548224

755262,5,6303995705,"Robert Altman takes another large cast and tells engrossing, interconnected and overlapping tales of modern LA life as no one else can. Based on the short stories of Raymond Carver, yes, the movie is long, 189 minutes long to be exact. But what stories! They echoed and resonated and stayed with me and I can't imagine what you would cut. So, its 189 minutes. Take your time.
There isn't a ""movie minute"" in the whole film, which doesn't mean there aren't surprises. These people act like real people, they do what real people do, which means they surpise the hell out of you all the time. Character is revealed not so much by words but by unanticipated responses and actions.
I don't want to divulge too much of the individual stories as it would spoil the moments of revelation.

755263,4,6303995705,"This is a panorama of L.A. made up of eight interweaving plots based on the short stories of Raymond Carver. Carver's stories don't necessarily translate that well to the screen because they are about mostly stunted emotional lives and their events take place almost entirely on the inside. So the best acting performances in Altmans Short Cuts are by the actors who can convey those vagaries well and make them interesting. Julianne Moore and Matthew Modine to my mind give the best performances as the couple which finds it is unable to directly cope with a three year old moment of infidelity. Moore is a painter who paints people appropriately frozen in one emotion or another(similar to Longo or Salle) and Modine a doctor who is not equipped to see things except with scientific eyes. The two have some memorable moments together when their lives intersect with another plot line. They invite Anne Archer and Fred Ward(who are having their own meltdown) over for an L.A.  cook out and the evening turns into a weekend. They all end up in clown make up as the strange and liberating weekend wears on. Wish this segment would have been given a whole movies worth of treatment.
Other stories include Andie Macdowell and Bruce Davidson and their little boy who is hit by a car driven by Lily Tomlin whose lover is played by Tom Waits. The first couple experiences grief while the second rebirth. Tomlins daughter is played by Lily Taylor and her group of friends include Robert Downey Jr. and Jennifer Jason Leigh and their story line just never fully develops into anything. Tim Robbins plays a philandering  motorcycle cop whose wife is played by Madeline Stowe. One of Robbins lovers is played by an equally unfaithful Frances McDormand but none of these are but mildly interesting characters which just sort of remain on the drawing board which is unfortunate because they are all such great actors(wish they would have thrown aside those limiting short story plots and let their characters grow) . The problem with big group efforts like this is that no one story line is given enough time to develop and it ends up feeling like a soap opera, a good one but one that has to sort of remain on the surface skimming over lives that can't fully be realized in such short cuts. There are a couple more plot lines but in the end you are left exausted because of the running length of this but also feeling a bit unsatisfied for the stories remain separate plot lines and so there is no large overall vision being painted on this oversize canvas just lots of little moments mostly downbeat  in montage. As a mini series this might have become something on the order of Tales of the City and done with L.A. what Maupin did for S.F. but just too many underdevelped and underlinked story lines.

755270,5,6303995705,"The book was just a collection of short stories dealing with quite ordinary people in our modern society, with their ordinary problems, all revolving around the relations each person or each couple could entertain with others, and the disruptive effect of some dramatic events or feelings, like jealousy, the death of a child, a sexual drive suddenbly coming out of the cupboard, etc.
The film is going ten times farther but in a totally different direction. By editing the various stories in small cuts, very small sections, the various stories interlacing their little pieces one into and across another, we have a vision of our life as a jigsaw puzzle whose hundreds of small pieces have been thrown on the floor in a pile, in a tumble, and our life looks like in a jumble. When we live through our day we have the feeling that their is some directing line, some logic in the events of the day, even if our child gets hit by a car : the day has a certain continuity, each moment being the result or the consequence of the previous one, even if we forget something and we run into a rubbing friction with something or someone. But if we look at a life, what's more several lives, from outside we only see small incoherent pieces as if we were constantly zapping from one channel to the next, as if we were lining up in an unforeseeable and unplanned sequence of events the small tidbits our lives are reduced to.
Then the outcome of the day is unpredictable. Then the logic of our living lines is invisible. At the end of the day, we maybe have two or three pieces that go together but have been separated from one another by other small events that are parasites. The result is then obvious and boils down to several attitudes that bring some mental unity to the pile of rubbish it all amounts to. One couple will rebuild its unity by some frantic feeling and togetherness that will break up on the following morning to come back into synch on the following evening. One couple will get into a truth session about a past event and then become able to have a barbecue with another couple and to disguise in clowninsh colors and wigs that will fall on the following morning. Two other couples will split along a sexual line and the men will get into some frantic impulse and the day will be saved by an earthquake that will transform a crime caused by a sexual assault on a girl into an accident caused by nature. Another couple will transform their conflict with a birthcake-maker into a sentimental sharing of human feelings and sorrows in the shape of a tasting session of pastries or muffins. Another family will be reunited by the father getting back the dog he had gotten rid of, to the joy and welcoming laughs and screams of the kids and the sudden desire to share some physical union. Another will be a vengeful act from the discarded husband who will just plain destroy everything in the separated wife's house, cutting all the furniture and clothing into tatters. In this case it will be the logic of destruction in the process of separation. And the earthquake will destroy the only element that had been spared : the big grandfather's clock owned by the separated husband and left standing and running like a beacon of his passage and vengeance. And finally a singer, the mother of a cellist, will face the suicide of her daughter by getting into some personal jazz session, into some sublimating artistic practice, not to forget, but to tame the guilt she feels because she was not able to listen to the suffering the daughter had come to express during her rehearsal with her musicians.
Life is but a grainy or even seedy pile of small events that has no meaning, but that is kind of magnetised into some meaningful conglomerate by a final action or event that informs the disorder with some epiphany that will never last longer that the wink of an eye.
The film thus gives us a crude vision of what our lives are : nonsensical disorder and improvisation in front of a flow of events that lead nowhere. It is a new form of existencialism in the world of zapping, rushing and virtual reality and communication.

Tim Robbins was memorably cruel as an adulterous police officer who wants nothing more than to get rid of the family dog. Lily Tomlin is a diner waitress who has a co-dependent relationship with Tom Waits as an alcoholic limo driver. Tomlin, one day, hits a child who is running across the street. The child turns out to be Casey, the child of characters portrayed by Andie MacDowell, excellent as the doting mother and housewife, and Bruce Davison, who is his reliable self. These parents are planning Casey's birthday party and order a cake from a bakery run by Lyle Lovett's character. When they fail to cancel their order or pick it up from the bakery (they are grieving because Casey is actually killed when he is hit by the car), Lovett begins calling their house over and over reading passages from the poem ""Casey at Bat"" with seemingly sinister intentions. When Davison and MacDowell finally go to the bakery to confront Lovett and attempt to beat with with a French baguette, they manage to tell him their son has died. Lovett looks perplexed and offers them, of all things, a roll. Other highly memorable people here... Jennifer Jason Leigh as a housewife, phone sex operator. Robert Downey, Jr. and Lili Taylor as horror make up artists. Julianne Moore as an artist tormented by her husband (Matthew Modine) who believes she has been unfaithful. Huey Lewis and Fred Ward as friends who go on a fishing trip and find a dead body. Intricate story which almost never becomes boring. The few moments that are boring, however, most center on a lounge singer woman and her daughter played by Lori Singer, who, if memory serves, is a cellist who swims naked in her pool. Like most Robert Altman films there is a good story and a splendid ensemble cast.",982368000,4,2134,4.708556149732621
755330,4,6303995705,"Unfortunately, Magnolia was a pretentious, self-indulgent, ridiculous piece of crud. Short Cuts, on the other hand, is quite a good film.
Because comparisons of these two films have been invited in past reviews, well, let's compare.
In Magnolia, P.T. Anderson tries very, very hard to make his characters unique and interesting. Too hard. You can literally FEEL him pleading with you to acknowledge his witty perception as a director. The performances are fairly good, but, just like the direction, there is something self-important about the cast of characters in and of itself. Like every character is just crying for an Oscar first and foremost.
In Short Cuts, the pretention factor is kept reasonably low. The characters feel a bit more ... real. A bit more sincere. They are more interesting, and the performances are less self-conscious. Magnolia tries for controversy and the illusion of depth in the character department, tediously drawing out one or two single, fairly obvious issues for each given person (and not resolving or doing much of anything with them, either.) Short Cuts is more sure of itself, wastes less time *trying* to seem ""important,"" and consequently allows its characters to live and breathe, and occasionally even laugh. In Short Cuts, you will not witness any characters blatantly preaching to the audience (the child on the gameshow in Magnolia -- blech), nor will you witness them trying to (weakly) ""blur"" the line between film and reality, (the male nurse on the phone, talking about 'this is the scene where...' -- blech.)
There's more. Short Cuts contents itself with portraying what it has to portray, and telling the stories that it has to tell. It does not, like Magnolia, feel the need to ""explain"" itself through the use of some lame, oblique, arbitrary voice-over narration. It stands on its own feet. Additionally, although I'd be lying if I said I was nuts about the jazz number in Short Cuts, it is infinitely more tolerable than the disgusting, ostentatiously employed Aimee Mann folk song that pollutes Magnolia.
Is that enough? Want more? Well, how about this: Gimmicks. Magnolia is full of them, and they rake on the nerves. The folk song. The frogs. P.S. Hoffman's aforementioned conversation on the phone. Blech. The kinds of a thing a director does self-consciously in a pathetic attempt to make his or her film seem more provocative, ""bold,"" and ""deep, man."" In the case of the frogs I felt like Magnolia was trying to be, you know ... ""fun"" and ""wondrous."" I almost gagged. Just because it's unique doesn't mean it isn't still really, really stupid.
The only similar gimmick Short Cuts employs is the earthquake scene at the end. And incidentally, that's my least favorite part of the entire movie, I think. The ending itself is interesting, but ... such goofy attempts to ""tie it all together"" are never welcome. Yes, we're all in the same boat. But that's a cliche piece of common sense which shouldn't be used to end an otherwise multilayered, entertaining, and interesting film.",981763200,4,3037,5.003952569169961
755331,5,6303995705,"I originally read the book by Carver, ""Shortcuts"", and expected, as usual, to be disappointed by the screen rendition.

Much to my surprise, the film was incredibly well-done. Despite it's 3+ hours in length, I never once left the theatre to use the bathroom, (afraid I'd miss something important) or looked at my watch.

This is a film about the unpredictability of life and how groups of strangers in the same California city cross paths, and affect each other in very profound ways.

Ensemble casting is not usually a big favorite of mine, but this film contains some of the best acting roles, by some of the most well-known actors, in film history. And that is not an under-statement.

Lily Tomlin, Tim Robbins, Andie MacDowell, Julianne Roberts and Jennifer Jason Leigh are brilliant, funny, and believeable characters that do Carver's characterizations true justice. Even Huey Lewis, Tom Waits and Lyle Lovett, especially Waits, make for interesting and believeable characters.

Jack Lemmon in one of his last performances is brilliant as the estranged father of a newscaster, who is brought back together with his son at the hospital after Lilly Tomlin's character accidentally hits his grandson with her car. Tomlin is so likeable and real in this film I couldn't get over it. What a tremendous actress she is!

This is one movie where I laughed hysterically one minute, and felt like crying the next.  It's a movie about life's every day emotions, up's and down's, unpredictability, family, relationships, jealously and trust. Everyone can relate to a little part of what each character is going through in the film, and it draws you in and keeps you tied to the screen like few movies have the power of doing.

While the plot(s) here don't sound like anything new or exciting, the characters and stories are so interesting, and inter-twined in such a way, that it grabs your interest from the start and doesn't let you go until the final second.

This film throws away stereotypes, glitzy lifestyles, female-only nudity and other false pretentions so common in Hollywood films. It's raw, disturbing at times, emotional, humorous, a little bit over-the-top, and suspenseful...a little of everything.

This story reminds us that no matter who we are or where we live, that life is never under our total control. We are all affected by the same events, and we all have the same basic feelings of anger, jealously, hatred, mis-trust and happiness on a daily basis - regardless of what social class we reside in nor how ""in control"" we think our lives really are.

Strangers affect our lives just as profoundly as people we know very well.

This film deserves a place in film and literary history. I can't recommend a better movie, it's truly an amazing piece of work.",970617600,16,2773,4.914346895074947
755332,5,6303995705,"I saw this movie when it first came out and found it SO engrossing! While long, the film keeps your attention the whole time, and I thought every  plot line was totally intriguing. I recently saw ""Magnolia"" and  felt disappointed that it wasn't as good as ""Short Cuts"",  although the potential was there. Jennifer Jason Leigh's character sticks  in my mind, particularly when she's doing phone sex while diapering her  baby! It was absurdly dark scenes like that which made me think Altman had  a great knack for observing human nature. I thought the whole cast was  excellent and I loved the way the stories intertwined. To the reviewer who  thought the earthquake was out of place, I think they misunderstood the  whole device as a way of tying everyone together - 'we're all in the same  boat' so to speak. I left feeling better about this whacky, often tragic  world we live in. It makes you think a lot about how we relate to those  around us, whether we ever meet the people we interact with on a daily  basis or not. Brilliant!",964137600,11,1034,4.554347826086956
755333,3,6303995705,"Short Cuts was fairly good. It was well acted and the stories were good too. Yet, something was missing. The main reason why I watched this movie is because so many people were saying that Magnolia was somewhat like it.  Well, since I loved Magnolia, I decided to give it a shot. It wasn't bad  but there was nothing like a good surprise except for the ending. Overall I  think I liked Magnolia allot better but Short Cuts is definatly a movie  that should not be ignored.",961027200,,472,4.390804597701149
755334,2,6303995705,"I rented this movie because I really liked Magnolia, and I thought that this would be pretty good. It started out with some sort of epidemic in LA called the 'Med-fly' which they never entirely explain. The stories were  all so-so, most of them you don't even care about the characters. The only  exeptions were the boy that gets hit by the car and the violinist. Also the  story about Stormy Weathers, and how he messed up everything in his  ex-wife's house was pretty good, but beside that, it was an unrealistic 3  hours. Almost all off the situations are either under extodinarily strange  circumstances, or everyone was acting in an entirely diffrent way than you  would expect. I kept on thinking, oh well, this will all amount to an  amazing climax, most likely having someething to do with the 'med-fly', the  only thing they hadn't yet explained. But no-oh... there was a random  earthquake sequence in which nothing happened and nobody's lives changed  except for the woman that the pool-cleaning man murdered (who wasn't even a  character until the last 5 minutes). It was almost like Robert Altman wrote  the entire script and then died 10 pages before it was done, and then  someone else wrote in an earthquake without een reading the script! How can  the horrible exquse for a movie be given any praise! It's ludicrous!",959040000,7,1333,4.759825327510917
755335,2,6303995705,"I rented this because I had just seen Magnolia and  had read many references to this movie.  After seeing it, though, I fail to understand all the hype.  It really isn't that good of a movie.  Forgive me for  comparing it to Magnolia, but I have to.
In Short Cuts, I never felt  real close to any of the characters and involved in their lives, except  maybe Lily Tomlin's character.  Overall, there wasn't a sense of  closeness...immediacy with the situations. In Magnolia though, I felt much  more moved by the entire movie; it is a much better character study, as  well as a better drama. Both the acting and writing of Short Cuts weren't  that great--I was expecting more from a movie full of so much (undeserved)  hype.  The ending didn't clear/resolve as much as I wanted.  It honestly  left me numb, uncaring about the characters, and wondering why in the hell  I had just spend three hours watching it (I still regret it).
I don't  recommend this movie.  I'd rather spend three hours with Magnolia, that's  for sure.",955324800,5,1023,4.608938547486034
755336,5,6303995705,"A finely acted movie about modern L.A. life doesn't seem like the long film that it is, telling its 8 stories simultaneously in such a way that your always on tenterhooks.  Although not wholly loyal to the spirit of  Raymond Carver's terrific short stories, fans of the author should enjoy  this unusual amalgam about the high and sleazy class of Los Angeles for the  grace of its direction and the fine perfomances from an all-star cast.  Tim  Robbins as a pompous, philandering cop is especially notable, and Andy  Mcdowell does a terrific job as the mother of the comatose boy in A Small  Good Thing.  Well put together and very riveting.",951177600,5,641,4.702702702702703
755337,1,6303995705,"I must say that I was excited to see this movie.  Being an admirer of Carver's work,  it was interesting to see how it would be adapted to film.  I don't know who wrote the screenplay, but whoever it was completely  destroyed the original ideas of Carver's stories.  Had I seen this without  reading the stories I don't know if I would have liked Short Cuts.  But,  having read them, I almost couldn't watch the whole thing.  Stories like  ""So much water so close to home"", ""A small good thing"",  and ""They're not you husband"" were stabbed at but so horribly  interpreted as to make the viewer wonder if the person writing the screen  play actually had liked Carver's work.  I suppose that most fiction adapted  to movies is normally plot-based, general plot is all that has been  retained from the original stories in this movie.  The thing that  disappointed me th most was the handling of ""A small good thing"".  There is, in the original story, something about the baker that makes you  develop a better understanding of humanity and how we perceive things.  This is all lost in the movie.  Dialogue is unnecessarily changed and  situations are changed in order to fit in to the ""tied-in"" format  of the movie.

Some might argue that you see enough ""everyday life"" in  your own life (still following me, guys?) and that it is not something you  want to see in a movie... Okay, I get that. But this movie was great! It  has a great cast - Lili Taylor, Andie MacDowel, Lily Tomlin - and a  wonderful story line. So many people, so many adventures... so much  happening.

7858579,5,6303995705,"Excellent, but also painful to watch.  In each of the interwoven stories, the characters are looking for something that eludes them.  They learn nothing from their failures.  The stories are not resolved, but we get enough of them to grasp their essential and inescapable sadness.  What is most frequently sought is meaningless sex, on the side.  Because it is meaningless, it does not satisfy.  Most of the characters are couples with children, but there is little love between them, and they don't much try to improve their relationships.  Better to try to torment their spouses.  Death is the second major theme, but most of these characters are so self-absorbed that they barely notice it--in one case, quite literally.  In one clever sequence, a simulated death and a discovered body are each misinterpreted as murders.  Analogously, telephone simulated sex is craved more than the real thing, and the thought that a painting of his naked wife is on display stimulates a serial philander to return to his wife. It's no accident that this film is set in LA. One decent couple provides some contrast, but they suffer the worst and most irreparable loss.  Only the alcoholics can make an approach to happiness. No one ever accepts responsibility.  Instead, either they see themselves as victims or they resort to suicide, alcohol or,somewhat unrealistically, an earthquake.
