8086836,2,B000BHUUCU,"This video is hard to follow especially if you are beginning sign language. You have the word shown on the left side of the screen, a picture in the upper corner and the person signing on the right side of the screen so you have to look on the left for the word/words or in the upper left corner for the picture while the person is signing on the right side of the screen. Sometimes you may not catch all the sign because you are reading the word and/or words, or the word is signed to fast. The sign is only made once and if you don't catch it the first time you will have to replay. You will need to have some experience under your belt before using this video. I do not recommend it for beginners. Also, there is no spoken sound on this video(only music)so you cannot rely on hearing a word, you have to be able to read or look at the picture. You must also know the alphabet in sign languare because some of the words or pictures are simple spelled out. No specific sign is given.",1298851200,,984,4.130208333333333
