8629144,3,B00H1YZH92,"One would suppose that the French (referring most especially to those of France and Belgium, but to other Francophones, too), of all people in this world, know a thing or two concerning sexual identity, about the infinite variety of love and of men and women (""Vive la difference!"") who love and lust for each other, and so forth, but that does not mean that they always convey superior worldly advice or (if there be any) offer definitive insights. Maybe they just tend to be right most of the time! But perhaps not in this often tiresomely mannered film, which is rather like a long joke that is just too exquisite for its own good. The North American edition viewed of ""Les Garons, et Guillaume,  table!"" (a.k.a. ""Me, Myself, and Mum"") was Seville/Entertainment One 200533-DV, which includes helpful subtitles in English; there are no bonus features included.

Guillaume, alike the character and the actor portraying it, is just too invariably coy. Essentially, the main male character suffers misunderstandings about what role his mother (and his father) really wish for him to live out. It seems like someone would have to be mentally retarded not to get the message more quickly than Guillaume does, since the comedy so constantly and directly poses it, compared to how even ""real life"" (whatever that may be) does so. Well, the mother does send mixed messages, as Guillaume eventually figures out for himself by the end of the movie.

There are some amusing moments in this film. The farcical depiction of the English (Guillaume being packed off at one point in the movie to an English boarding school) with all of their world-famous eccentricity, is funny. So are Guillaume's absurd dealings with gay men. (To this film's credit, the real gays with whom he comes into contact, unlike those whom Guillaume has imagined for himself, are just too relentlessly strong and masculine for him to identify with!)  Anyway, there is enough to enjoy in the film to make watching it worthwhile. That is so despite the many boring stretches, due to too much preciosity, which really should not have been needed. Guillaume finds, after all of these battles of the sexes, those especially within himself, that he is a man, an heterosexual one, at that. How and in what way, in spite of the overbearing mother whom he also portrays, is left here for the reader to discover for himself!",1439424000,,2377,4.876237623762377
