5679352,5,B00BWQU0RY,"Ordered this set through WB before it appeared on Amazon, and I'm very happy that Amazon is offering it for sale now as this iconic TV show's 3rd season was one of its most entertaining.

Watching these episodes over 30 years after they originally aired lets you appreciate the things you maybe didn't appreciate in the past. For example, the appearances by Corey Feldman (pre-Goonies) and Nancy McKeon (Jo from The Facts of Life and a myriad of Lifetime movies). Episode highlights include Mel selling the diner, Alice dating Tommy's principal, Vera playing Cinderella, and Flo having her beau-less New Year's Eve.

There are 24 episodes on three discs and, although they are manufactured on demand, they are very good quality. This is definitely the best that I've ever viewed these episodes, and believe me it's worth the purchase price to see them all in their entirety. For the cost of about two movie tickets you get a whole season of Alice, Mel (Stow it!), Flo (Kiss my grits), and Vera at their best. By the end of it you'll be clamoring for the release of Season 4.

Also of note, as of the writing of this review, Alice Doesn't Live Her Anymore (the movie on which the tv series was based) is available on amazon again, I received my copy a few days ago. Looking forward to an Alice marathon!

Highly recommend this iconic tv series! Enjoy!",1364515200,14,1350,4.659663865546219

5679354,5,B00BWQU0RY,"Ever since I ditched satellite tv, I have rediscovered the great shows of the past.
The 1970s was the period I spent growing up.
I watched Alice with my family as a teen along with other classics like the Carole Burnett Show..
Great to hear "" Kiss my grits!"" again
I find the 3rd season funnier than the first 2. The show seemed to really find itself by then",1449187200,,358,4.202898550724638

5679366,3,B00BWQU0RY,"I had enjoyed watching Alice growing up in the 70's. It was one of the few shows my Mother and I could agree upon. For this reason, I was looking forward to watching the series again. However, somehow it wasn't the same. Today, it seems heavily plotted and predictable. Much of the comedy seems too plotted or overly pushed for a laugh. I never remembered the laugh track as being soo annoying, either. Still there were some episodes I thoroughly enjoyed. And I was surprised to learn that the lady that played ""Eat My Grits"" Flo was also Tim Allen's mother-in-law on ""Home Improvement"". I shared these discs with my mother and she didn't get as big a kick out of them anymore either. I guess it is a testimony that some series hold their own through time and others should only be watched IN their time for complete enjoyment.",1425513600,,827,4.52

5679372,5,B00BWQU0RY,"Season 3 is awesome!  The gang is in top form during season 3 including a hilarious two part episode called The Last Stow It, in which Mel sells the diner and the waitresses along with it!!  This is classic TV.  The physical comedy is top notch (missing in today's so called sit coms).  I would definitely recommend Season 3 of Alice.  It will have you in stitches!  I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! :-)",1415577600,,399,4.253333333333333

5679378,5,B00BWQU0RY,"This was such a bittersweet season. While each episode was hysterical and the acting from all of the stars top notch, it all built up to saying good bye to one of TVs most iconic characters Florence Jean Castleberry. Broke my heart to see the Flo leave. I always hoped she would return one day but alas it never happened. Great season of Alice. A must have.",1393286400,,357,4.343283582089552

5679381,5,B00BWQU0RY,"By the third season of Alice, the actors were perfectly cohesive, and totally comfortable in their roles. Each episode flowed with more natural comedic comebacks, surprise twists, and fine-tuned performances by the multitalented singing and dancing super mom Alice (Linda Lavin), the gum cracking Texas tornado flirt Flo (Polly Holiday), the naive and dingy Vera (Beth Howland), and the gruff and barking, but softhearted Mel (Vic Tayback). The four were by now like a closely knit family, especially with Alice's perspicacious son Tommy (Phillip McKeon), as the binding force. The episodes are hilarious and provide wholesome entertainment for everyone.",1383523200,,654,5.616161616161616
5679382,5,B00BWQU0RY,Love season 3. My favorite is block those kicks and the two part show as Mel's diner is sold to owner Mr. Briggs. The girls all get fired and I love how they get the diner back. All funny stuff.,1383350400,,194,3.875

5679388,5,B00BWQU0RY,"The third season of ALICE consists of 24 episodes that aired Sunday nights on CBS during the 1978-79 TV season. Halfway through the season ALICE was moved to the prestigious 9:00 Sunday time slot and became the CBS anchor for the night, a position it would hold until the fall of 1982.

TV veteran William Asher (""I Love Lucy"", ""Bewitched"") directs most of these installments and it's here that that show starts cooking on all four burners. Some of the earlier episodes had a static feel to them--not so with this bunch. There's a terrific two-parter where Mel sells the diner to a snooty restaurateur (Hans Conried) and the series walks the fine line between comedy and pathos in the terrific season-finale ""Flo Finds Her Father"" (played by F-TROOP's Forrest Tucker). That episode as well as the one that precedes it on this set (""My Fair Vera"") boasts exceptional video quality. In fact, I noticed an improvement on most of these episodes over those on Warner Archive's Season 1 and 2 sets.

The writing just seems sharper at this point in the series, and surprisingly, even though the episodes themselves are self-contained, there is a continuity that was unheard of on sitcoms at this time. ""Alice's Decision"", ""If The Shoe Fits"" and ""My Fair Vera"" all make mention of Alice auditioning for the same talent scout and Vera appearing in a children's theatre production of Cinderella.

If you have been on the fence about springing for any of these M-O-D ALICE sets so far, make this the one to get--you won't be disappointed.

FIVE STARS and bring on Season 4 and FLO: THE COMPLETE SERIES.",1379289600,2,1591,4.774545454545454

5679390,4,B00BWQU0RY,"I love this show.  It's always good for some laughs.  You can't go wrong buying this DVD set.  ""Alice"" is a great show because it doesn't just give you a lot of laughs, but it deals with serious subjects at times like Vera's trying to kill herself and Alice dealing with being a widow with a small child to raise on her own.  Thank goodness that a lot of the good TV shows are now available on DVD because I'm not too crazy about the new sitcoms on TV.  I look at DVD's much more than I look at TV.  Sure, no comedy could ever compare with ""I Love Lucy"", but sometimes I like to look at something funny in color and ""Alice"" fits the bill just right every time.",1377388800,3,660,4.038461538461538
5679391,5,B00BWQU0RY,This video brings back great memories of the mid to late 70's when life was much simpler but great new happenings were taking place!

5679398,5,B00BWQU0RY,"I watched this show every Sunday evening after church with my family. It was Alice and the Jefferson's every Sunday night. The characters all just seemed to play well together. The comedy is original, and ages well for the most part. Obviously, the show was done more than 30 years ago, but for those of us who lived during that time, it's almost like going home again. Even with those moments, I think most people will enjoy the comedy that deals with the problems of every day life faced by working people.",1373241600,15,508,4.532608695652174

8574767,4,B00BWQU0RY,"This 1978-79 Season saw Alice gets its sitcom service down to a science, delivering regular orders of laughter and workplace wisdom weekly while enjoying a regular slot in the top twenty. Series regulars Vic Tayback (Mel), Vera (Beth Howland), Polly Holliday (Flo), and Philip McKeon (Tommy) fit their roles perfectly, while Linda Lavin (Alice) set the comedy temp, whether it be a slow-burn simmer, smoking hot slapstick, or on-the-boil gut-busters.

 Situations found in this 3-Disc, 24-Episode collection include used Car Wars between the girls and Mel, Vera coming down with A Slight Case of ESP and Flo Finds Her Father ( Forrest Tucker). Meanwhile Tommy falls in love, Alice falls for a (younger!) theatre director and  most horrifying of all  Mel sells the diner!
