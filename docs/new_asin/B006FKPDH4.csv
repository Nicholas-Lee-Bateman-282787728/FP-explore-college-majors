I was curious about the context leading up to the ending and gave the show a watch. School Days contains many of the tropes of the harem genre but is accurate in the deconstruction of them. Love it or hate it School Days is an entertaining show.

The main protagonist of the story is Makoto Ito seems to be the textbook example of the protagonist of the harem genre. He's an average high school student that really only has vague personality traits. The difference between Ito and other harem protagonists is from his complete and utter stupidity. While other harem protagonists have bad decision making due to character traits such as shyness, fear or the sparing of feelings Ito's is from making as many poor decisions as possible. Some examples include looking at a magazine of girls in swimsuits minutes before he goes on a date and randomly taking pictures of girls off trains he finds attractive. Over the course of twelve episodes its easy to believe that Ito decided to be as big of a moron as possible to break some type of record. Due to his lack of solid characteristics looking for positive features is a waste of time.

Another trope of the harem genre is establishing why each of the girls likes the protagonist. Some of them like the protagonist because they are childhood friends, some club members or other students they happen to meet, or because they look up to the protagonist with hero worship. The tropes however are very loosely played with in School Days. All of the girls seem to be interested in Ito because he's the main character. From the lack of solid motivation the story avoids placing all the blame on Ito alone and becomes a cautionary tale on how intense people can work their emotions and feelings up.

The ending of School Days is a twist on the harem ending of the story where the main character throws up their hands because they can't decide to only be with one and choose everyone. The show is entertaining not from being clever or charming but from the stupidity of the protagonist and questionable decisions of all the characters. Love or hate the show its no denying the ending will always be remembered.",1391644800,,2257,4.6375
8497058,4,B006FKPDH4,finally an anime where the guy isn't so sensitive and afraid to indulge in his desires. now i only say that because if you watch alot of anime if your like me you love it but you would like the main character to be a little different and actually not be afraid of the girl nor be afraid of getting some action sometimes. good series and great job in setting this main male character aside from all the others.,1375315200,,409,4.189873417721519
8497059,5,B006FKPDH4,"If you're an anime fan & you like the typical strong harem fighting fanservice anime with weak minded males who are scared of girls then this is not for you. You have Makoto who is kinda weak minded but what makes this different from all those other anime's is when girls come at him, he takes advantage of the situation. This is what gets him into trouble & leads to the surprise ending. Some of the episodes during the series were hum hum filler types but overall it's a good series IMO, I wish there were more like it, defninitly reccomend it...",1369612800,2,548,4.382352941176471
8497060,3,B006FKPDH4,"Jokes aside, I didn't appreciate how the anime decided to go the bad ending route of the game. Yes, the game is notorious for its gory endings but it seems to remove the fact that all the characters are flawed and focus on their worse points just to get publicity.

The anime is a deconstruction of a harem anime and shows what would happen if you're that type of guy who tries to get the perfect harem ending in visual novel games. This anime shows that it wouldn't work like that without backstabbing and murder.

Makoto is the biggest jerk in all harem animes although the manga and the beginning of the anime and game makes it clear that he wasn't a jerk and was a loser nobody until Sekai seduces him when he's finally beginning a relationship with his crush Kotohana. Once he got Sekai to teach him how to please the ladies, that's what he ends up doing; going around ""winning at life"" until it becomes a stupid plot. The worse part is that all the girls ends up betraying each other for him and it leaves the viewer wondering how these people can be friends with backstabbing each other.

Those three bullies are the worse of the bunch in the anime because they get away with every horrible thing possible. They get away with harassing Kotohana once Makoto cheats on her until she breaks down, they backstab a certain character who wants nothing to do with Makoto by filming her and her boyfriend and then posting it around the school and then backstabbing their ""leader"" by scoring with Makoto. And the worse part is karma doesn't hit them and they needed it more than Makoto or Sekai (and much as Makoto's ""friend"" Taisuke who is a rapist).

I'm almost glad Makoto and Sekai got what was coming to them at the end and I feel really bad for Kotohana because she only becomes a yandere after she snaps but there were signs of it from the beginning...and that was caused by bullying and having no friends or anyone to turn to except her little sister.

Overall, watch the series for the nice boat but don't buy it at this price.",1362614400,,2034,4.442359249329758
8497061,3,B006FKPDH4,"This anime is almost like every other highschool anime out there, at first. But after a few episodes things change and it really made me mad. I related to this story very much and its sad how Makoto, sutpid, immature guy, uses and plays with the feelings of a beautiful and innocent girl. He leads her on and then suddenly, after becoming a couple, ignores her and cheats on her. It soo sad and it really makes me HATE Makoto. I hate all guys like him and its because of guys LIKE HIM that really give nice, sweet, caring guys like me, a NO WAY chance in hell to ever be with a beautiful princess of a girl. After watching this anime i was mad at males and also i was very empathetic towards Katsura. I didn't buy this anime on here but i wanted to review the story a bit. But yes, the 3 stars is also including a very high priced item. Worth a watch, but NOT at this price!",1338595200,5,874,4.087209302325581
