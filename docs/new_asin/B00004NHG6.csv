8525525,2,B00004NHG6,"While it contains ""some"" useful information, the overall quality of this product, both from an information and video quality persepctive is poor. The video looks like something that was transfered from someone's home movies and reminds me of the old super 8 home movies I saw when I was a child. The intent of the product has some significant potential but it is lost in the overall quality of the presentation.",1199577600,7,411,4.802816901408451
8525526,3,B00004NHG6,"I bought this video along with a couple of books:  Fodors, The Best of BVI (Acheson) and the crusing guide that came with my ""Moorings""  bareboat cruising package.  The video gave me an idea of what things generally looked like but wasn't very comprehensive. Watching it was a lazy way to get a brief overview of the islands but this is not a stand-alone option if you are traveling to BVI. If I had to do it again, considering the prices of the more comprehensive books (about half), I'd skip the video.  I'd have a better opinion of the video if it were priced at $12.",985737600,5,570,4.349056603773585
8525527,4,B00004NHG6,"This is a great preview for anyone chartering a sailboat for the BVI. I checked it against ""Yachtsman Guide to the Virgin Islands"" and it gives a great view of entrances and exits from harbors (and what to watch for). The narrative is accurate (how to approach a harbor, etc.) and is an excellent pictorial of the area. The composition is slightly amateurist, otherwise I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to charter a sailboat in the BVI. Whether bare-boating or chartering with a captain, this will give you a great view of what to expect.",982972800,,546,4.697916666666667
8525528,5,B00004NHG6,"If a cruise through the British Virgin Islands is in your future, this is the guide that will get you there. The beauty of the islands is captured so brilliantly you'll be counting the days, hours and minutes until you can  see this tropical paradise for yourself!
Even experienced sailors will  benefit from the advice of these intrepid travelers.  You'll not only learn  the safest way to navigate the sometimes tricky passages, you'll even get  advice on the best places to do your laundry or catch a memorable  meal.
This pleasantly narrated video is of great value to the tourist as  well.  It's packed with tips to make any visitor feel at home in the  islands, whether on land or sea.
No detail has been missed, so the only  mistake you can make is to pass on this wonderful video guide to cruising  the BVI's.",951523200,12,817,4.56551724137931
