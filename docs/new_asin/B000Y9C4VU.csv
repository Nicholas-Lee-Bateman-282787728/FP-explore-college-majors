8231417,5,B000Y9C4VU,"This was an excellent series which, surprisingly, ran for three seasons!  And the days when there were few ads.  Wolf, of course, was a Tarzan for the headbanger, I want my MTV crowd.  He did very well.  The acting was good and the stories were never trite.
I am fortunate that I know someone with a SAG card, who was able to make perfect copies of the whole series on 4 DVDs.
This is a Tarzan for the whole family.",1477872000,,415,4.15
8231418,5,B000Y9C4VU,"This VHS tape features four excellent episodes from the 90s tv series.  I love the actors Lydie Denier, Wolf Larson, and Sean Roberge. Everything about this show is so full of life.  The actors are are joy to watch and so is the real jungle scenery that the show was filmed in. The show does not rely on CGI. I'm not sure it's possible to buy the whole series.  This show leaves you feeling good!",1358294400,4,396,4.253333333333333
