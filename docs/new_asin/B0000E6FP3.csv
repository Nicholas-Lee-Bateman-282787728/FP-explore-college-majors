8002078,5,B0000E6FP3,"Neon Signs was released in 1996. It stars Carol Lynley in a fine action film, where she  and Barbara McNair shoot the hell out of everything. Pretty entertaining. I loved this. Fans of Carol Lynley will like this the most.",1522713600,,222,4.55
8002079,4,B0000E6FP3,Not a bad film. I'm a big Barbara McNair fan so that was the biggest reason why I bought it.,1491955200,,92,3.65
8002080,4,B0000E6FP3,This film is actually extremely entertaining.  William Smith and his companions are planning to heist a high stakes poker game and everything flies wildly out of control.  Nothing turns out as you expect.,1215561600,,204,5.151515151515151
8002081,5,B0000E6FP3,"While this is certainly not the best film I've seen my favorite actor William Smith is in it and I rate any film he's in five stars or above. Bill is my guilty pleasure!  He can make a film, even a bad one watchable.  He is good actor and has done some great work over the years.  Also it was good to see Carol Linley again sine I haven't seen her in awhile.  Neon Signs starts out slow but overall is a fun little film!",1197936000,3,420,3.9058823529411764
8002082,3,B0000E6FP3,"Carol Lynley & Barbara McNair are a campy hoot as aging bad gals out for fast times and fast money as they wreak criminal havoc along Route 66.  Unfortunately, they are only supporting characters in an inadequately written story about a backward boy named Otis who supposedly comes of age while trying to get to Las Vegas.  More holes than Swiss cheese, but the cast tries hard to rise about the material.  Thank goodness for the presence of the aforementioned pros who at least make the first hour some fun to watch!",1078790400,8,517,4.5978260869565215
