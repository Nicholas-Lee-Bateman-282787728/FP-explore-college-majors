3658865,2,B001JP6572,The goofball in the video must like the sound of his own voice.  His instructions are somewhat limited as he will perform a function without telling you what button he is pressing and the video shot of the Tascam doesn't show the whole unit so at times you are left wondering which button did he press.,1271376000,,302,4.392857142857143
3658866,5,B001JP6572,Excellent video for training on the Tascam Recorder DP-02. Just like going to a classroom. Takes the frustration out of reading heavy manuels that just confuse someone!,1268870400,,168,5.2592592592592595
3658867,5,B001JP6572,"The companion DVD for the DP-02 is invaluable.  Yea, I read thru the manual, but for me it is really helpful to see how it's done.  The DVD is broken out into easy to scan chapters so there isn't any scanning to find a specific lesson you might want to review over.  Great for any one who isn't even remotely familiar with digital recording.

I use it for recording original demos and with the export wav feature, I can send them easily to friends all over the country for add'l instrumentation and comments. I was an old Porta-Studio (read cassette tape) user and love being in the digital world.  Living proof you can teach old dogs new tricks.",1264809600,,646,4.440677966101695
3658868,4,B001JP6572,"This is a pretty good dvd. The host is a likeable guy and easy to listen to. There were some parts that I wish the dvd would have explain in greater detail. There is atleast one mistake on the dvd. The dvd states that both the Dp-02 and Dp-02cf contains a chromatic tuner, which is incorrect, only the Dp-02 has a tuner. This is the only mistake that I noticed but there could be more. Overall it explains most functions of the 8-track well but is a bit over priced.",1262822400,,466,4.188888888888889
3658869,5,B001JP6572,If you have a DP-02 this DVD will make using it a breeze. It's as simple as that.,1260403200,2,81,3.5555555555555554
3658870,5,B001JP6572,"I got this video after purchasing a DP-02 from Guitar Center and not knowing how to use it.  I was skeptical about the DVD and especially didn't want to pay $40 for something that would take up my time and not get me very far.  Let me just say it was well worth it, even if I had spent $40.  The chapters on mixing and mastering, and how to use with a computer are great.  The guy who does it all is very knowledgeable and has a cool Australian accent.  You also learn other tactics to recording which are not directly connected to the DP-02.  It is somewhat fast paced to fit a lot in, but is fine for going over until you get the hang of everything (using buttons in sequence, auto punch, etc).  This video did exactly what I needed and I've been using this recorder and making music with it for over a year now, and almost never had to look anywhere else for instruction.  Highly recommend!!",1259712000,5,894,4.2176470588235295
3658871,5,B001JP6572,"TASCAM says any idiot can use it out of the box. I'm not any idiot. I've used AMPEX 300 multi track recorders since my days at CHESS Records in Chicago. I was beyond whelmed when I bought the TASCAM DP 02. I could not figure it out! The manual assumes that the buyer knows a LOT about digital recording. I don't.

The DVD put it all in place with a very intelligent walk through. I found out that it can do things magical that the manual doesn't even address.

If you're gonna buy a TASCAM DP 02 or DP 02/CF, You gotta get the DVD even if you are experienced in digital recording.",1252281600,8,580,4.123893805309734
3658872,5,B001JP6572,"I bought this because the manual shows you how to use the buttons and settings OK, but doesn't walk you through the step-by-step you need if you are new to the game.  As the narrator says - At the (low) price of the machine you may have just bought one to try it out (got mine on Amazon) and not have all the necessary experience to use it first time out.
  The narrator is very easy to watch and seems to really enjoy the product.  He does a terrific job with explanations, and if you missed it you can replay.  Overall, I'm very impressed with this video.  The narrator (teacher) is also an excellent player, so his examples are quite impressive and inspiring.  I believe video really helped me out with the DP-02.",1232668800,12,716,4.338345864661654
8313209,5,B001JP6572,"It's very good, and does a much better job of explaining how to use the DP-02 than the manual.  Money well spent.",1456790400,,113,4.136363636363637
8313210,5,B001JP6572,A must for learning the ins and outs of the DP-02  or DP-02CF. This was actually ENJOYABLE to watch as the instructer knows his way around the system and has used TASCAM professionally before. You will not be dissapointed.,1432771200,,222,4.6923076923076925
8313211,4,B001JP6572,Very helpful but missed a step,1409184000,,30,4.166666666666667
8313212,5,B001JP6572,"I was suprised that this product arrived in less than 3 days. I wanted this product because it was my understandng it was a good tutorial for learning the proper recording methods for the Tascam DP-2 Recorder. After viewing DVD, I was very pleased with the product.",1330732800,,265,4.659574468085107
8313213,5,B001JP6572,I had no experience with track audio recording prior to purchasing. This DVD made it very simple for me. I'd recommend this DVD to everyone that wants the ease of learning with great results.,1325894400,,191,4.647058823529412
8313214,3,B001JP6572,"Overall, I'd recommend this DVD because I found it infinitely more helpful than the ""instruction manual"" that comes with the recorder.  I've done some in-home recording using analog gear, so that helped me get started with the DP-02, but I found the instruction manual less than adequate when it came to expanding my skills.  The DVD proved to be helpful by providing information I'll be able to incorporate in my future recordings.  Some of the descriptions and demonstrations of the functions the recorder is capable of are pretty darn quick, but I guess that's why the remote comes with ""rewind.""  All-in-all, the DVD is worth the price because now I have a helpful reference as I work expand my ability to use the capabilities of the DP-02.",1307232000,2,744,4.834645669291339
8313215,4,B001JP6572,"I would not have made it to first base without the tutorial. Sometimes you will feel he is not explaining the whole process- but he is actually covering topics in the order of the manual. Do what he does; NOT what you want to do! And it will all come together.

Songwriters can often have a challenge recording vocals and the instrument at separate times. I wish he had shown a bit more real life (me) kind of stuff. When you record guitar and vocals at the same time- panning, for example, is an issue. Tip: It's not as simple as left and right; because some guitar is on the vocal and some vocal may be on the guitar- you might need to pan both to the left-ish side to find the middle with your hearing! Let the Force be your guide. . .

I started from scratch, technologically cursed and am having some success. I see the light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this tutorial.",1299801600,2,880,4.201183431952662
8313216,4,B001JP6572,"For anyone getting into home recording for the first time purchasing the DP-02 or DP-02CF Tascam recorders, i would certainly recommend purchasing this DVD.

Though a bit expensive for a DVD, without this DVD I would have been totally lost. I have used smaller 8 track recorders in the past, and everything is pretty straight forward as to the overall functionallity of these things, but the DVD gets into patching, track editing and some more complex featuers i would not have been able to figure out too easily on my own.

A bit expensive, but certainly helpful and got me recording, editing, mixing and mastering in very little time.

The instructor explains things very well, going over basically every feature of these units. The pace of the DVD keeps things moving without going too fast, or getting boring moving too slowly. He aslo seems very excited about this product which made me even more excited to get started!

I am one that needs to have a visual to learn. With this DVD i felt comfortable and confident moving forward to start recording!",1296518400,,1055,4.78021978021978
8313217,5,B001JP6572,This video really helps understanding this recorder much faster than just reading the manual. I recommend this video to users of this perfect machine!,1285372800,,150,5.291666666666667
8313218,5,B001JP6572,"I boughtt the DVD a couple of weeks ago...its very clear and explains the DP 02 really well.
If you need to learn how this recoreder works, buy this dvd. He takes you step by step into the operations and its very user friendly,pleasant to watch, and listen to. The instructor has the machine right in front of him as he explains the various functions and capabilities of this baby. I am really glad I bought this dvd...its a great resource to learn this recorder with. I'm a singer/songwriter/musician and new Pro Tools user, but also wanted something simpler to get my hands on while I learn PT. It's a cool machine and this DVD excellent to get you going,understanding and working this 8 track baby. I'd buy it again!",1281139200,,719,4.538461538461538
