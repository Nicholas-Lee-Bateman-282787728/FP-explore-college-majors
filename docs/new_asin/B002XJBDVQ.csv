8660393,4,B002XJBDVQ,"I had a lot of fun playing around with these 'fonts'. Each letter of every font creates a series of words in place of a single letter. The effect, when typing with intention or arbitrarily, is a sort of automatic abstract poetry. The one thing that stuck out to me most is how well thought out each group of words is within each letter. While the product created from typing is certainly gibberish, it doesn't FEEL like gibberish. It reads in a semi-cohesive fashion, pointing towards Paul Chan's deliberate and well thought out selection of each letter's word pairing. Definitely a fun, novel and interesting experience. (Oh yeah, not for children, hee hee.)",1271635200,2,659,4.84070796460177
8660394,5,B002XJBDVQ,"This was awesome, it's like having a voice you never knew you had and don't have to take responsibility for. You can just speak as yourself and then you're speaking as someone else who's way naughtier. Good fun, good for the repressed and it's great to try all of them on.",1271203200,,272,4.352941176470588
8660395,4,B002XJBDVQ,"At first it was a little funny trying to find a purpose for the fonts. Other than a game, or just for play or used as code I didn't know how to explore them. In that way they are really interesting, as something without clear use or purpose they definitely create an encounter between the viewer/user and it. Now when everything is so directed and controlled and interfaces are designed for you to move a certain way within them it's refreshing to have something that refuses to behave similarly.",1271203200,,496,4.584269662921348
8660396,5,B002XJBDVQ,"Tittilating.  Eductional.  Dirty.  Disturbing.  Strangely enlightening.  Political.  Confusing.
All you could want in a font and more!
I'm shocked to see what's exposed when Chan's fonts turn my own writing into perverse, sexually charged poems.
I was confused by the concept at first, but the fonts explain themselves quickly.",1260403200,4,327,5.571428571428571
