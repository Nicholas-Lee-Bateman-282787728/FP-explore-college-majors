However, I was so dissapointed that I had to share my experience to prevent others from falling in the same trap.  I made the mistake of buying the entire kickboxing series (3 DVDs), thinking that I could get a jumpstart in my kickboxing training with these DVDs.  To my surprise, all 3 DVDs in the series do NOT have any audible explanations of the techniques/moves contained in the video, making this DVD impossible to follow and a huge waste of time and money.

Thinking that I may have obtained a ""bad"" DVD series, I've been calling the distributor for assistance, but not surprisingly, I can only reach the sales department (instead of customer support) and no one seems to be able to help me.

My last resort was to put a complaint with my credit card and see if I can get my money back so I can close this horrible chapter.  Please do yourself a favor and DON'T order this product!!",1157241600,,989,4.4972067039106145

Hector Echavarria is a former champion of the U.S. Karate Association and the American Karate Association and a Vale Tudo Kickboxing Champion.

In this video volume Hector Echavarria demonstrates warm up exercises, good fighting distance, basic fighting stance and footwork; no worthless traditional classic stuff.  Hector demonstrates basic punches: the jab, the cross, uppercut, hook, basic kicks: the roundhouse kick, side kick, and a front push kick to stop an opponent and control fighting distance.  Hector demonstrates how a Muay Thai kick goes thru the opponent where as a karate kick makes contact; but does not have the same penetration through the opponent.

Hector demonstrates combinations of punches, kicks, blocks and parries and parries using the elbows.

If you are thinking about taking up kickboxing, this is a good video to get a preview what you will be doing.

Other volumes of this instructional video series include:
