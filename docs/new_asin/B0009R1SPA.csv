8065571,1,B0009R1SPA,"Why is a concert named after a real movie? Riding in the car with a friend thus week, she told us we should see the movie about Jamaican bobsleding. I whipped out my phone and ordered it to watch on Saturday night. Popcorn and snacks ready and when my husband put the disk in, IT WAS A STUPID FREAKING CONCERT. Stupid on my part for not reading the full description.",1478390400,,366,4.242857142857143

8065575,5,B0009R1SPA,"Back in 1991, I heard a cassette recording of this concert from a roommate of mine from college..  He had taped a PBS show of some sort, but neither he nor I had any idea of where it was from, other than knowing it was one of the Reggae Sunsplash's.  Luckily, I finally found this DVD of it, and could connect the sound to the footage after long last. Some great songs on this one, specially ""whey mi belang"", and the epic Third World ""96 degrees"" and ""Try jah love"".  The encore of that last song as the credits roll one of the best live musical experiences ever.  Other notable hits include Gil-Scott Heron's ""Bottle"", and the informal discussions that go on between the narrator and the musicians every now and then.  If you are a Reggae music fan, this is a disc worth having.",1410307200,,780,4.3517241379310345
