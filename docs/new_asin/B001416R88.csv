8253969,3,B001416R88,I just wasn't that crazy about it. I will use some of the moves in the choreography without doing the choreography.,1398384000,,115,4.523809523809524
8253970,4,B001416R88,"I haven't actually tried to learn the choreo on this DVD, but it is well-filmed and Sahira has a sunny nice disposition that seems to shine through on here. It is quality stuff even if you do not want to learn the choreo. Plus the skirt section at the end is a great added bonus!",1294358400,,279,4.090909090909091
8253971,4,B001416R88,I purchased this to learn to do with my daughter in a mother daughter event. It is fun and not too hard to learn. I think young adults learning belly dance would have fun learning from this because sahira has a youthfulness that they can relate to. I like sahira. She really takes the time to make sure you understand the moves. Not technical but subtle. I find it hard following some of the ones who talk a lot and make it seem like you are sitting in a class learning the mechanics before you get to actually try it out. I like it when you are taught a little and then you get to practic it before moving to the next portion. I also like the ones that use the music while learning rather then being all talk and then you apply the music later. If you want to learn a fun choreogrphy this will be a nice selection to practic for new ideas.,1240099200,5,840,4.096969696969697
8253972,5,B001416R88,I would recommend this DVD for any intermediate belly dancer who wants to change up their routine. Her instructions are easy to follow and I hope to use some of her moves in a routine very soon.,1229644800,3,194,4.27027027027027
8253973,5,B001416R88,"This is Sahira's second DVD and it's just as great if not better than her first DVD, ""Arabian Spices""!  This DVD delivers everything the info on the case says.  The combos are short and easy to learn. In my opinion, she leans more towards the ATS form of Tribal Fusion. I would recommend this for intermediate to advanced dancers who want to spice up their routines.  I would also highly recommend her first DVD.  This is definately worth the money and I'm looking forward to Sahira's next DVD.",1205798400,12,494,4.579545454545454
