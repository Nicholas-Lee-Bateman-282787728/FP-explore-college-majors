The images in the books are amazingly detailed and I think it's a real treat for anyone who is a collector to have something like this wonderful story in their collection.",1519862400,,271,4.313725490196078
8548755,5,B0073D6CW2,"Not being air-mail, this predictably took a while to get here, but it was faster than the estimate.  It arrived in great condition.  The DVD is region 2, so a region 2 or region-free DVD player (like VLC) is required.  The only audio is Japanese, but I thought the English subtitles were fantastic.  The show lasted approximately one half hour, and there weren't many extras.  Note that perhaps one third of the show was animation and the rest was panning across static pictures.  I didn't think it detracted from the story, but I thought I should mention that it is not fully animated.  There weren't a whole lot of pages in the book, but the illustrations were beautiful, with seiyuu dialog written in Japanese.  The DVD is embedded in the back cover.  It was a cute Alice-In-Wonderland sort of story, even incorporating a few very minor amounts of fan service (no nudity).  As a fan of Code Geass, this was a nice little addition to my collection without breaking the bank.",1438214400,3,976,4.654970760233918
