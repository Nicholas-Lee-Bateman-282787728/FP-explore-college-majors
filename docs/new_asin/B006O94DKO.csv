5008823,5,B006O94DKO,"This one is just as good or better then the first one. The story line flows seamlesly threw the first, seconed, and movie with out so much as a hicup. They did a good job on this.",1363737600,,179,3.864864864864865
5008824,5,B006O94DKO,"Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is simply the greatest series in the history of Gundam Shows. That may be a strong claim but it is easily supported. From the art style, to the gorgeous mobile suits, to the intense battles, to the engrossing plot, all the way to the dynamic and deep characters, this show has it all.

I will start with my bias. While I respect the Universal Century for being the first of it's kind, I also feel as though it isn't worth any of the deification it continues to receive. Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Zeta Zeta Gundam, and Char's Counterattack in particular have been given an unfair bias in the slew of Gundam games that has been hitting the market in the past ten years with all of their pilots and missions making it into the game while later series' are given token representation. That isn't fair as shows like Wing and Seed are better composed stores and shows like X, Turn A, and others are more intriguing to the American audiences that never got them. All this to say that I am definitely prejudice towards the newer series and have found 00 to be the cream of the crop.

While Season 1 of Gundam 00 was enough to consider it a epic tale in its own right, the second season takes it straight through the stratosphere from Episode 1 and scarcely looks back. I could finesse every single detail of why Season 2 works, but what you need to hear is this: The show is astounding and if you haven't yet seen it... it is worth the money to invest. The first episode in particular (of Season 2) I was struck by. It seamlessly picks up where the first season left off and really sucks you right back into the world. It is a masterclass show and worth the consideration for certain.",1358640000,4,1705,4.3924050632911396
5008825,5,B006O94DKO,"It's rare for a Gundam series to have a second season, but Gundam00 does so and pulls it off with even more intensive action and more cool Gundams than even the first season had, new characters and more enemies add to the depth of the show, it is definitely worth getting especially if you've seen the first season.",1358467200,,315,4.448275862068965
5008826,5,B006O94DKO,"You get a mix of action, drama, suspense, etc.  If you've seen the anime, there's nothing I can think of that would surprise you.  Keep an eye on the price, I purchased this when it lowered from the $100s down to about $44.",1356825600,,223,4.162790697674419
5008827,5,B006O94DKO,Awesome. If u like to watch Gundam series this is a must have to any collection. To me this series is my 3rd best behind Gundam Seed & Gundam Seed Destiny.,1348704000,,155,4.032258064516129
5008828,5,B006O94DKO,"Be afraid of the next Gundam series... The art is pretty... interesting.  Gundam AGE looks like Pokemon in space.  So while you can, pick up a copy of Gundam 00 and enjoy the wonderful, more grown up look to this series.

I will leave this brief review spoiler free.  The story picks up a little after the events in the first half of the series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-00-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B006O94DFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mobile Suit Gundam 00: The Complete First Season</a>).  I actually bought the second season when it briefly dropped to $29.99 (from Amazon w/Prime shipping).  I got lucky.

The story line takes a different path in this half, but we see many of the same characters as in the first half.  Again, no spoilers, but if you have finished the first half (which you should have before watching this half), then you know some people were lost.  There are a few new characters introduced, and others take a more central role in the story.  I think that Saji's character becomes one of the more interesting characters in a Gundam series yet.

The animation is top caliber.  The series was set up for HD, and was the first Gundam series to be animated with HD viewing in mind.  Sadly, this release is currently only available on DVD, but even in standard definition, the animation is crisp and clean.  The lines are so precisely drawn and the computer editing and animation is flawless.

The audio is quite phenomenal as well.  Sound effects are realistic and the mixing is such that they don't suddenly 'boom' and disturb neighbors.  The Japanese audio is fantastic.  Sunrise takes great pride in casting voice talent, and the voice actors are matched perfectly to their roles.  The English dubbing is along the lines of previous Gundam series, just decent.  If you can't stand reading subtitles, then I guess the English dub would suffice; but I highly recommend watching at least once with the Japanese audio track.  The music is stellar as usual.  Sunrise added some great tracks, and though the opening and closing songs aren't quite as good as the first season (L'Arc en Ciel and Brilliant Green both rocked the openings); one of my favorite Jpop bands, Stereopony, does have the fourth intro song and UverWorld has the third intro song.  Both are very good, just not as rockstar as the first and second.

Something I might point out.  The Gundam series now is standing a bit above other mecha series.  Part of this is the realistic future aspect of the series.  Sunrise hired several consultants for this project.  If you look at the credits, they have engineering consultants, physics consultants, and science fiction authors consulting.  Pretty amazing that this studio is taking this franchise so seriously.  Though it does make one wonder what they were thinking with Gundam AGE and the Pokemon/Eureka Seven look...

This, to me, is the future of hand drawn / computer aided and edited animation.  A remarkable series for story line and presentation.  If you are a fan of the giant robot / mecha anime, then this is a stunning addition to the genre.  Even for those who haven't gotten into mecha anime might give this series a whirl.  It's remarkable for being more than just robot fighting.  We have a rock solid story, amazing characters, flawless animation, and a realistic future setting.  Buy and enjoy watching many times.",1346457600,10,3432,5.0212765957446805
