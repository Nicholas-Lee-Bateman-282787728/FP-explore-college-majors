1619325,5,B00005KB4D,"I know what a lot of people have said about this movie, and I know that the eighth Doctor is in that ""fuzzy"" region of the Who universe.  Still.  I love Paul McGann's Doctor.  As he is shown in this movie.  As how he is shown in the Big Finish audio series.  And as how he is developed in the BBC novels.  I would have to say that while I have always loved the 7th Doctor, and what Virgin publishers did for the seventh Doctor, this and the other works under the Doctor by Paul McGann are my treasured possessions in my many Whovian stuff.  This is not what you would call an in-depth movie.  But it is something that is suppose to be for the Who series: fun.  This is a fun movie.  It has full connection to the series (especially if you read the novel Lungbarrow, the last of Virgin 7th Doctor stories) and as well as having the regeneration scene.  Which is somewhat important at least for me.  I love the story, Paul McGann shows himself well as a Doctor.  He builds from the old, develops him, and pushes him toward the future (especially when you connect this tv movie to the novel series and the Big Finish series).  Fun.  Fun.  Fun.  Yes the big problem is that this is only on Region 2.  I had to buy a regionless DVD player to play this, and the other Doctor Who releases.  But you can pick one up for only, say 60 bucks.  Worth the effort.  This movie is worth it.",1212710400,,1375,4.152091254752852

1619327,4,B00005KB4D,i really enjoyed watching this new begining of doctor who with paul mcgann as the doctor his performance reminded me of tom bakers and peter davidsons potrayal of the doctor. i loved eric roberts as the master he was very scary and sinister. its too bad this was shown on the fox network because no one really watches that network it would have got much larger ratings success if it had been shown on sci fi network channel.,1206489600,,424,4.448717948717949
1619328,3,B00005KB4D,"The Doctor Who TV movie, a British-American joint venture aimed at potentially launching a new TV series, is routinely slammed among Doctor Who fans as nasty and aborted chapter in Doctor Who history best locked away and forgotten.

But it's not that bad.

Paul McGann's Doctor is funny, quirky and intense - perfect to follow Sylvester McCoy's reign as the Time Lord. In fact, McCoy gets the first twenty minutes of the film to himself before the Frankenstein-themed regeneration sequence. The Seventh Doctor's final appearance is a strong performance and perhaps the best part of the movie.

Once McGann settles in, the plot gets murky and takes turns most Who purists wish it had not. The fact that McGann's Doctor is half human is an integral part of the plot and can't be swept under the carpet as easily as some fan would like. The effort even features an American-style car chase, of course. The Eighth Doctor's performance, however, is solid throughout.

The TARDIS stars in this story alongside The Doctor, Grace, Lee and The Master. Even when poor camera work in some of the TARDIS scenes makes the mostly adequate special effects look like spray-painted Styrofoam and flashing lights, the time machine looks grander than ever. Even the high-tech TARDIS of the new series pales beside this one. The old girl has class.

While Yee Jee Tso's performance as Lee is wooden and amateurish, he does not have enough dialog to do much serious damage to the production. Eric Roberts first does a nice impression of the previous Master's voice, but after a line about getting used to his new body, Roberts' own mannerisms turn a menacing foe into something that eventually becomes like a perturbed Liberace.

The plot wraps up with convoluted convenience, but the story ultimately does not leave a bad taste in the mouth. It's a good effort and worth seeing. Just don't watch too closely.",1192665600,4,1888,4.884375
1619329,4,B00005KB4D,"I have a region 2 DVD player so I have this movie at home.  It is not bad, though some parts of it may have fans scratching their heads. (eg The Doctor is half human??)

I found Eric Roberts as The Master very entertaining.  I did not care for the portrayal of the Daleks.  They made it seem like they were justified in condeming The Master to death, when they thenselves are practically space nazis.

Paul McGann did a good portrayal of The Doctor and is probably the best looking one to play the role as well.  Dr Grace was a decent companion, and I liked the brief romantic interlude between them.

This movie probably would have done better if it was geared more towards actual Who fans.  I know they were trying to get a new audience with it in the US, but it obviously didn't work out.

Paul McGann has done some great Who stories with Big Finish Audio that are worth checking out.",1173484800,12,887,4.295180722891566
1619330,4,B00005KB4D,"Buyers beware:  This DVD is advertised as a Region 1 NTSC DVD... It is not.  It is produced by BBC Home Video as a Region 2 PAL DVD.  I ordered this thinking I had found a Region 1 NTSC copy.  Fortunately I have means to play it - Both a Region Free PAL to NTSC capable DVD player and region removal computer software.

Other than misadvertising the product format, this really is an excellent movie, a must for any Dr. Who collection.  Most 'regeneration' stories are better than average, and the regeneration sequence from 'Dr. Who - The Movie' is one of the best. Viewers get a chance to bid goodbye to Doctor #7 Sylvester McCoy, who played the part very well when provided a decent storyline (lets not bring up 'The Hapiness Patrol' and similar stories - Sylvester McCoy really shined in stories such as 'Rememberance of the Daleks' and 'The Curse of Fenric'), and hello to Paul McGann, an excellent choice to portray Doctor #8.  It's a pity that this is his only appearance as the Doctor other than by audiobook or novel. Production values are very good, and the design details of the interior of the Tardis are eye catching. Eric Roberts interpretation of the Master was well performed, as were the roles of Grace Halloway (Daphne Ashbrook) and Chang Lee (Yee Jee Tso).

Hindsight is 20/20, so there will always be thoughts of how the movie may have been better realized.  I agree with critics that the machine gun sequence was a bit excessive, however I was excited with this story when I first viewed it via network broadcast in 1996, and it really was not outdone until the series rebirth in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston (Doctor #9) and Billie Piper. (Why did we not get a regeneration story from Paul McGann to Christopher Eccleston?  It would have made a great new series episode, apart from carrying on a well founded tradition.  Perhaps a flashback as part of the new series would be interesting, and let's not forget that the Doctor has 'run into himself' on certain dire occasions.)

I look forward to the 2006 'David Tennant' series and many future years of Doctor Who (Sci-Fi Channel, don't let us down...).",1148169600,5,2127,4.642666666666667
1619331,3,B00005KB4D,"As ""Dark Angel"" and ""Firefly"" fans well know, the talking heads at the FOX network have an uncanny knack for truly sticking it to the science fiction community and this mismash of eleventh-hour script rewrites is no exception.  It's a glorious ""What-Could-Have-Been"" storyline that is brilliant in its first half, falls into incomprehensible mush for the second half, then rushes to an admittedly-satisfying ending.  Visually it borrows heavily from elements of ""X-Files"" and ""E.R.,"" up to and including the hospital-oriented dramatics, with a recurring theme of advancing clock hands/digital clock displays.  The storyline might best be described as a fusion of Pertwee's ""Spearhead From Space"" and Tom Baker's ""The Deadly Assassin"" set in present-day San Fransisco.

First off: Paul McGann is brilliant.  He adheres to the cardinal rule of ""reinvent the Doctor the way YOU think he should be played"" that has worked so well for every actor before him, and we get a charming, easily-distracted romantic with a hypnotic gaze.  Eric Roberts likewise brings a great combination of sadism and quirky humour to the Master.  Sylvester McCoy is back on form as the Doctor's seventh incarnation as if he never left, and Daphne Ashbrook manages to steal scenes even when the script has relegated her to the familiar ""stand to the side and ask 'What's it all about, Doctor?'"" routine.  Mention should also be made of Yee Jee Tso's very good performance as the wayward teenager who becomes an unwitting pawn in the Master's plan to regain his physical Time Lord existence.

The TARDIS interior is unbelievable.  You get the impression that this is what the series's original designers would have aimed for all along had they the budget.  This TARDIS is truly a living entity, with its own personality traits and an architecture that combines Victorian decor with a Gothic cathedral and then dresses it all up in a Jules Verne wrapping.  Many fundamental premises from the original series are preserved, including the TARDIS key, the contents of the TARDIS's tool kit and even the familiar materialization and ""cloister bell"" sound effects.  Other passing cues include jelly babies, a weirdly long scarf, squawking Daleks in the background, and a ""500 Year Diary.""

What the fans haven't been able to accept are the out-of-nowhere plot changes that conflict with many established premises, of the type that seem to have been added to the script for the benefit of new audiences.  Why would the Time Lords construct a time machine who's power source can only be opened by the retinal scan of an alien (human)?  A motorcycle/ambulance chase scene does nothing to advance the plot, although the Doctor's interactions with secondary characters are at times touching, at times hilarious.  There is also an over-reliance on CGI visual effects that, while dazzling to look at, don't really add to the story and end up looking pretty out-of-place (hey, this IS the series famous for its wobbly sets and lurching green bubble-wrap monsters).  I need to also work in some praise here for John Debney and Louis Febre's beautifully composed orchestral soundtrack: there are a number of moments where the music carries the story  --certainly a long way from Dudley Simpson's dull clarinet fanfares or Keff McCulloch's over-synthesized chase scenes.

Like it or hate it, this episode IS the only visual representation of the Doctor in his eighth incarnation (McGann would go on to broaden the role in audio adventures), and while it has been accepted as canon by the fan community, the acceptance is a bit grudging.  Nevertheless there are enough definitive ""that IS the Doctor"" moments to offset the weak second-half script, good DOES triumph over evil at the last instant, and of course we all know... the Master WILL be back.",1142899200,126,3803,5.081993569131833

No the story line was not great, revolving around the whole Y2K thing, but I really did like the Doctor, to bad he did not get to do another. I see that you can get the dvd in the UK, but not here.  To bad for those who are die hards and would want the 8th Doctor in their collection.  I guess waiting for this one will be the same as waiting for the 2005 dvd collection which is out in region one in canada and who knows once they shoot the new 10th Doctor when that will make it across the pond.",1141430400,4,652,3.6956521739130435

This movie is just the beginning of a series of events that finally led to bringing the Doctor back for a new generation of Whovians! I loved all of the extra 'behind the scenes' stuff that came with the movie, too. A whole added disc just full of the features I love to see. It included a look inside the 8th Doctor's eccentrically decorated Tardis interior and much more. The history of  Doctor Who was explained with a look back at previous Doctors, as well as the account of the significant effort it took to get this movie made at all. It gave a new perspective and appreciation for the process. There were interviews with Paul McGann and all of the folks who worked hard to bring The Doctor to the small screen again for a new generation of Whovians! Paul played a very charming, rather childlike, handsome and romantic version of our Doctor, so I really enjoyed the story, (remembering the era in which this movie was made, of course) This is a 'must have' for any Whovians DVD collection!",1460246400,5,1064,4.456410256410257
1619415,4,B00005KB4D,"The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) is transporting the remains of the Master to their home world of Gallifrey. The Master isn't quite fully dead and manages to escape his locked urn as a puddle of goo. The goo messes up the TARDIS, forcing it to crash land in 1999 San Francisco. The Doctor leaves the TARDIS and is caught in gangland crossfire. He's taken to hospital where cardiologist Grace Holloway fails to save him since she can't figure out his internal workings (you know, the two hearts and all). His body is carted off to the morgue where he regenerates as the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann). He's got a bit of amnesia which slowly recovers as he has more interactions with Dr. Holloway. Meanwhile, the Master in goo form has infested the ambulance driver and plans to take the Doctor's body for his own as well as hijack the TARDIS. Action and mayhem ensue.

The production values are quite high for the old Doctor Who series. The editing is well done--as the Doctor regenerates, the morgue attendant is watching TV on which the Boris Karloff Frankenstein come alive. This is further intercut with the Master taking over the driver. The plot still has some big holes which are made up for by quirky little moments with side characters. The music is too obvious and over the top. McGann is good as the Doctor and probably would have had a good run with a full series. The Master looked a bit too much like The Terminator, making him more cheesy than threatening. Grace is an interesting companion and shows lots of potential. Too bad they did not keep going with a full series.

I'm definitely not a fan of Paul McGann as the Doctor.  He reminds me more of someone who should be playing music alongside Duran Duran.  Maybe that was ""the look"" for the day; but it doesn't work for me.  And the female star (whose name is escaping me right now) is completely unbelievable.  Eric Roberts as the Master is the one shining light in the movie because he is such a great actor.  He has an ability to play cunning-malevolence that is flat surreal.  So this is a good movie to get if you're a Doctor Who fan and you devour anything and everything Doctor Who, good or bad.  But I don't recommend it for someone who hasn't seen much of the earlier or later Doctor Who series - - not good as an introduction to Doctor Who.  So I rate this 2 stars not just because it's a poor interpretation of Doctor Who IMO; but also because this particular package never arrived.  I bought it as a Christmas gift.

1) The pre-Credits sequence was actually good in terms of setting up the plot and the Master and Doctor. It catches viewers and intrigues particularly if they've never seen Doctor Who before. Twas a pity that the backstory didn't end there.

2) The TARDIS design had some intriguing elements. Yeah, it was more than a tad crowded, but there's a lot to like in the hominess and atmosphere.

3) The Regeneration effect was a huge leap forward and the scene itself was done with some humor.a

4) Paul McGann really does his best with the material he's given. Even with all the problems with the plot, McGann shows great charisma and what a great Doctor he'd become even if that was just by audio.

What's bad:

1) The TV movie was supposed to appeal to new viewers. Instead, it really tosses them at the deep end of the pool. We have Time Lords, Gallifrey, regeneration, the Eye of Harmony, the Master, and a reference to Daleks for good measure. It seems that the writer never grasped that all of these elements only really matter if we are actually engaged in the characters. Instead, we got dumped with backstory that's really confusing to people who've never seen Doctor Who before.

2) Bringing the Seventh Doctor back to have him killed by medical malpractice. Really?

3) ""The Doctor is Half Human"" And so the TV movie managed to annoy long time fans while confusing new fans.

4) The story featured two one-off Companions in Grace and Chang Lee and gave them a lot of air time for characters who would never appear in Doctor Who again.

This story is almost the polar opposite of the approach that Russell T. Davies would successfully take nearly a decade later with, ""Rose."" In the TV Movie, we spend the first 20 minutes with the Seventh Doctor, we're given dozens of show concepts and tropes but with little reason to care about them and we're given a Companion who doesn't even end up travelling with the Doctor. In Rose, we're given hints about who the Doctor is as plot practically cloaks him in a cape of mystery. New viewers don't even learn before the last moment that the Doctor can travel in time. We learn about the Companion he'll travel with for two series and her family and friends.

Because of it's better design and effects, and Paul McGann's charisma and talent, the TV Movie is an improvement on the two previous stories that introduced a new Doctor but only just. And when you consider those previous two stories were, ""The Twin Dilemma"" and "";Mark of the Rani""; that's faint praise indeed.",1434758400,,2650,4.6050955414012735

He did the best he could, I guess, with the role.  I can't understand why they couldn't have found a British actor, in keeping with the tradition of Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley as the Master.  That being said, the regeneration sequence from Sylvester McCoy to McGann was pretty neat, as well as when he was starting to put together his ""look"" as the Doctor.  He (McGann) deserved maybe a longer run, than just the one off, to see how he might have developed as the Doctor, and how he might have played off future companions.

1619510,5,B00005KB4D,"For many people who have been invested in Doctor Who, this movie is a hit and a miss for many a fan. This movie was the first attempt at a reboot after years of hiatus and I think it came out in the early 90s, maybe late 80s. In any case this movie was a fast paced, made for tv movie at a time when Doctor Who was seen as a bit old fashioned and hadn't been on tv for a few years.

So, keep in mind there is going to be some spoilers.

I personally loved this movie. You may be a fan like me who maybe only goes back to classic who with the purpose of key episodes (the birth of the daleks, the birth of the cyber men, specials like that) and don't necessarily enjoy classic who for a mixture of reasons. I started with the reboot, went back and watched a number of things from classic who and typically I enjoy old shows/movies, but I could not get into the classic series. It was filled with continuity errors, the writing was hit and miss, the acting was off to me in many parts, the companions were quirky in some cases and annoying/useless in others...in any case I started with the reboot like many a younger Doctor Who fan.

So in my journies into finding more classic stuff, I found a reletivly contemorary Doctor Who film. A film? They made a movie? Well I just had to know and I watched it and fell in love. It was fast pace yet gave moments to breath. It gave us some laughs and gave us this sweet little romance that did not over power the film in the slightest given that it was not made the full force of the story. It was a side note, a sweet one (though a number of older fans at the time were reportedly displeased according to the features). There are some confused elements in the story given it changed hands, and there were budget issues and too many hands in the cookie jar, but over all this has a nice clean, and rebootish energy to it. It is fun gave us a Doctor that existed in at least 3 separate cannons in books, radio plays, and comics if not made any other appearance.

In general this is a really fun film that I highly recommend. It isn't too long, it'll make you laugh, you'll enjoy this nice little romp. Acting btw was very well done. I very much enjoyed everyone and the special features are nicely lengthed and engaging.",1412985600,,2259,4.162471395881007

(now called Classic Who)) until it was cancelled in 1989 and I went on to
other interests.  Paul McGann is great is the Eighth Doctor, a more wondrous
amnesic with a penchant for revealing a bit of future events.  When the
Seventh Doctor is shot after crash landing on Earth, he is taken to the
hospital where during surgery, he dies and regenerates into McGann.
Trying to escape the hospital he runs into Dr. Grace Holloway, the heart
surgeon who operated on him and he sneaks into her car.  She treats
him at home and soon he tries to find the Master, whose remains he
was taking back to Gallifrey, but he had escaped.

Eric Roberts does ham it up in this movie and Daphne Ashbrook, I

Not gonna bore anyone with the details if you're even looking at this then you're a Doctor Who fan and just a casual viewer or only interested in the new series but a through and through fan.
I don't think most people who only got in on the good Doctor since the new series came round are very much interested in anything before the 9th Doctors' era... but us longtime fans want the complete journey all the way from An Unearthly Child right up to The Time of the Doctor and beyond and this is definitely a 'key' moment in time as it's pretty much the only full-length adventure featuring the one and only 8th Doctor Paul McGann. I waited years, decades even for the North American attempt at Doctor Who, and whoever the producers were at least they had the foresight to no. 1 use a British actor and no. 2 being in Sylvester McCoy for proper continuity sakes.
But I've heard rumor that the ONLY two classic series episodes, which I consider this to be that were ever shot entirely on film are Spearhead From Space and Doctor Who The Movie (1996) unless you are talking the Peter Cushing films which I don't consider cannon... And really if you are a completest like me then you want even those films released in the U.S. as well on BD.
But personally besides Spearhead, most of all I want Doctor Who The Movie Special Edition released on Blu-ray where it belongs in glorious widescreen if it was truly made using film instead of tape like most of the rest of the classic series. What's also great about this besides the production values is that we really get our first glimpse of a truly new TARDIS interior which is grand and it's a shame they didn't keep it for the beginning of the new series or at least show it in The Day of the Doctor, after all The War Doctor was next in line (apparently) so he should have still had the 'desktop theme' from this era and Doctor Who the Movie is the gap that fills in the bridge between the old series and the new so it is definitely a Key part of the whole DW Universe.
I just wish the producers (Peter Moffat) paid much more respect to Paul McGann and this incarnation and gave McGann more to do with the new series... they've had the 5th Doctor (Peter Davison) meet the 10th Doctor (David Tennant) in Time-Crash and Paul McGann still looks very good so why wasn't he included in The Day of the Doctor? Sure he was in The Night of the Doctor and that was fantastic... but I and I'm sure a lot of people would love to see some stand alone specials featuring the beloved Doctor No. 8 as there are many adventures that we would all love not to miss out on...",1392249600,,2604,4.305498981670061

1619546,4,B00005KB4D,"As a long time fan of ""Doctor Who,"" I was a bit disappointed when this movie was first shown.  This movie, originally titled ""The Enemy Within,"" was made with the hope of bringing the beloved camp British series to the U.S.  At the time, their attempts to 'Americanize' the Doctor didn't impress me (or other U.S. viewers) and this show failed in the ratings.

Almost twenty years later, times have changed and my opinion has changed with it.  Watching this now, I can see that many elements of the New Series are present.  I guess this movie was just a little ahead of its time.

What many Americans fail to understand about the original series is that it was intended to be a children's show.  When viewed in that context, the famous campiness of the classic ""Who"" makes sense.  The monsters were deliberately designed to look fake, because back in the 60s and 70s, the conservative British mums didn't want their kiddies to be too frightened.  For years, ""Doctor Who"" was shown during Saturday tea time so the entire family could watch it together, and it followed the formula of ridiculous monsters & villains to thrill the kids combined with young, adorable companions to add spice for the Daddies.

When ""Star Wars"" came out in 1977, science fiction suddenly acquired a huge fan base, but the low-tech special effects of ""Doctor Who"" suffered by comparison.  By 1990, the show was losing steam, and the producers attempted to add more mature farebut the sudden addition of sexual innuendo and violence didn't go over well with British moms, and the show was cancelled.  At that point, the BBC sold the limited rights to American cable and this movie was made.

SPOILER ALERT!
My main issue with the plot of this movie is the revelation that the Doctor is half-human.  This detail has never appeared in any of the British episodes, and I've never liked the idea that our favorite Time Lord isn't fully alien.  And the insinuation that Dr. Grace Holloway is his mother is quite disturbing, considering that he and the doctor share a kiss.  (Though it's clearly a rather chaste kiss, it's a bit too long for comfort when the ending is taken into account.)
END OF SPOILER

After watching this again, I'm completely charmed by Paul McGann's wonderful portrayal of the Doctor.  It's a shame such a talented actor didn't get the chance to play this role for many years.  I still don't really like Daphne Ashbrook much, and maybe part of my dislike stems from the storyline itself.  Yee Jee Tso overemotes with enthusiasm in true, classic ""Who"" fashion.  I'll acknowledge that Eric Roberts did a fine job as the Master, and his interpretation locks into John Sim's manic and degenerative Master in a way that now makes sense, though I must admit, his version didn't sit well with me originally when compared to the suave evil of Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley.  However, Roberts' grating performance works well in the plot's context, and sets the stage for the later evolution into Sims' psychotic version of the Master.

This movie is the bridge between the classic ""Doctor Who,"" and the more mature New Series of today.  If you love the doctor, then you need to add this to your collection.",1391299200,,3192,4.740942028985507

This was an American take on Doctor Who that is considered canon with the actual storyline. As it is American, it had American ideas attached to it that completely took away from the actual Doctor Who feel. But it was in essence still a decent movie. On that note, the portrayal of the Master was an Americanized version, so it was a tad over the top, hence the weird snake-essence possession. There are many cultural gaps in American media verses everywhere else in the world, so it's easy to understand why this felt so different from the series itself. That and Fox is well known for bastardizing everything.
The story could have been stronger, but there was little funding for this film, see the Bonus features on disc 2 and you'll understand. Paul McGann was a great portrayal of the Doctor and I felt he could have had a wonderful point as the Doctor if they'd allowed it. HIs performance is what makes this film as good as it is.

2 things I didn't like (which really aren't reasons not to buy this movie, but...):
1. It's too bad that this was Paul McGann's first and only appearance as the Doctor for the last 17 years, I would have liked to see more of this Doctor's adventures.
2. Some of the fine details of the storyline don't exactly mesh with the Doctor Who universe - I won't say what and risk spoiling the movie.

It was a pilot movie that was suppose to turn into a Dr Who TV series.  I really like the movie that he did. He was really good. He would have been a great Dr Who if he was given the chance to do a TV series like the rest did. Fox studios decided they didn't want to do a TV series because they said there was enough interest here in the states back in 1996. So that left just Universal studios and they said they needed help with financing it, but couldn't find any.  So it was totally dropped.  When the movie aired in the UK there were over 9 million viewers, but here in the states it was just over 5 million viewers and Fox studios said that wasn't enough viewers. That was sad for Paul McGann as he was excited about doing a series after doing the movie. I saw him in a interview that was on the second disc that came with the movie.  There is a lot of information on the second disc about what happen and why there wasn't a series done in 1996 plus interviews with Paul McGann and others. Highly recommend.",1388448000,,1188,4.0

The memory of how this movie disappointed me made me afraid to watch the new Who in 2005. Luckily, a friend convinced me to give the new series a try, and I was able to forget the ill-conceived 1996 TV movie.

The DVD transfer is fine, and I did enjoy the special features (considerably more than the movie, actually). Learning the ""making-of"" details made the glaring weaknesses in the movie more understandable, and the little round table discussion by fans was hilarious, as they tried to find nice things to say about the movie.

Paul McGann had promise. He wasn't a bad Doctor. He was a doctor with a terrible story.

1619565,4,B00005KB4D,"I love everything Doctor Who, and I say that because I understand that it can skew my opinion.  Even the worst episodes I can find some merit in.  However, as many problems as this episode had, it is still Doctor Who. If you have only seen the New Doctor Who (2005-present) and especially if you weren't a big fan of Christopher Eccleston, this may not be for you. However, if you absolutely despise everything Classic Doctor Who (1963-1989) I would encourage you to watch this because I would put it a lot closer to the New Doctor Who series than the old one.

For the movie itself, I would rate this as high as I would rate some of the worst episodes of Eccleston (""Rose"" concerning the villain, not the introduction of Rose Tyler, and ""Aliens of London""/""World War Three"".)  There is definitely some brilliant parts to it that are worth seeing, but there are also some parts where you are asking, ""What?""  However, it is as good as it can be for what it had to go through to even happen (watch the 54 minute documentary ""The Seven Year Hitch"" included on Disc 1.)  And Paul McGann as the Doctor is fantastic.  I actually saw him first in ""The Night of the Doctor"" that came out in 2013, and loved him, and he is just as good in this movie.  As far as the special features are concerned, I have viewed all of them except the audio commentaries on the movie.  They are all good quality and most are interesting.

This feature-length tale describes the regeneration of Sylvester McCoy's Doctor into Paul McGann's, as well as bringing back the Master, all dressed Terminator style. This adventure, ""Doctor Who: The Movie,"" is controversial for many reasons. The TARDIS has gone all gothic library on itself, the Doctor kisses (oooOOooh!) Grace, the companion of the feature, and...most importantly, they make the Doctor half-human. Well, I am fine with two of these three things. First off, THE TARDIS LOOKS FREAKING AWESOME LIKE THIS. It's so gothic, so steampunk, and so brilliant. It looks like a marvelous time machine...with all the comforts of home! Who wouldn't want to read The Time Machine (or some other book) in there. Second off, yes, I can understand the big problem with the Doctor going all Captain Jack on someone, but you guys have to remember...regenerations can change a man. They can turn a young man in an old man's body into an old man in a young one's. And plus, it's the circle of life. Sure, he'd never done it before, but TV was moving on. Why can't the Doctor have a special someone? He certainly has a lot of them in the New Series, even a wife! And last, yes, this is where I really didn't like a change. Did the Doctor HAVE to be half-human to be likeable? No, he didn't! It just ruins the myths and mysteries built up on this fabulous character. Do E.T. or Superman have to be half-human for you to like them? NO, THEY DON'T. But, I've begun to be able to stand that part after looking at the explanation in the comic book called ""The Forgotten."" I recommend it, if for that reason alone. And the rest of the movie? Fine as well. Paul McGann is a great Doctor, quite likeable. And Sylvester McCoy always has been, even if he only has a few lines. Plus, there's motorcycle chases, jelly babies, and incredible jerks. Substantial parts to many different movies or Doctor Who stories.

Now, i'm not going to review the DVD, because I don't actually own it. I just watched it on the recent Doctors Revisited special. I am planning to get it though, so I might update the review if I do.

So, in all, this is not the best Doctor Who story ever, no, but it is really far from the worst. With the great Doctor(s), nice little tidbits, and decent story, you can forgive the half-human lies and the Master's range of acting as long as my fingernail.

1619579,4,B00005KB4D,"The TV Movie: the one attempt to relaunch the series between the original series ending in 1989 and the new series beginning in 2005. So long remembered as Paul McGann's one TV appearance as the Doctor or as that time the Americans ruined Doctor Who, the TV Movie was written off for a long time. It also faded into obscurity for many US fans due to the rights issues between the BBC and Universal kept it from receiving first a VHS and then later a DVD release. With the DVD finally out and with the TV Movie's profile rising again, perhaps we can finally see it  for being more then the single televised adventure of the eighth Doctor but also the comeback that should have been.

Perhaps the biggest highlight of the movie is that contains Paul McGann's debut as the eighth Doctor. Some of the actors who've played the Doctor have found their feet after some time, others almost immediately and it would seem that McGann is one of the latter. From the moment he appears walking out of a morgue in a shroud to the last scene in the TARDIS, McGann embodies everything the Doctor should be: eccentric, intelligent, melancholic at times yet be an all around watchable and likeable character. The American setting in fact highlights the eccentric qualities of McGann's performance even more. Perhaps the greatest shame of the TV movie is that this would be McGann's sole Doctor Who TV appearance.

There's also a good supporting cast backing him up. Playing the companion is Daphne Ashbrook as Dr. Grace Holloway who goes from a simple operation into an adventure with the fate of the world at stake. It helps that McGann shares some fine chemistry with her and the movie shines whenever they're together. Ashbrook also makes Grace's back and forth swapping about whether or not to believe the Doctor work despite the fact that it makes very little sense. There's also Yee Jee Tso as Chang Lee who does a adequate job due in what seems due in large part to the script rather than his skills as an actor. Not forgetting of course Sylvester McCoy's all too short appearance as the seventh Doctor in the opening minutes either though his appearance seems rather unnecessary and potentially over complicates the film for anyone seeing Doctor Who for the first time (something that this TV Movie was supposed to be for).

Which rather brings us to Eric Roberts as the Master. I mus confess that I am in two minds about Roberts' performance. There are times when he is actually quite sinister such as the scene when he initially meets Chang Lee in the TARDIS. Yet for the most part, Roberts is over the top at every possible occasion such as the ""I always dress for the occasion!"" line for example. The Roberts Master then is sinister yet over the top but whether that helps or hurts the film is left up to the individual viewer to decide.

The production values could easily rival anything that the new series has yet produced. Of particular mention is the music of composer John Debney's score, the first time that Doctor Who had gotten the feel of having a full orchestral score including the excellent version of the Doctor Who Theme used in the opening and closing credits. The design of the TARDIS interior with its Gothic/Jules Verne, almost steam punk, feel is also of note. There is also the superb direction of Geoffrey Sax throughout the entire movie which does its best to ride the fine line between the Britishness of the series and the American setting, something in which it sometimes succeeds and sometimes doesn't.

 Which leads to the script. For something that was meant to be the launch of an American co-produced  Doctor Who TV series yet is is seemingly continuity heavy. Within the first few minutes for example the viewer has the Master, the Daleks, regeneration, the TARDIS and two different Doctors being thrown at them. The movie itself works well with its mix of humor and a good vs evil storyline as the plot heads towards the Millennium (remember this was shown in 1996)  until the ending. While there's plenty of plot holes along the way (such as the aforementioned business with Grace shifting back and forth about believing the Doctor), for the most part though the story holds up despite those faults.

Where does all of that leave the TV Movie then? It features a fine debut for the eighth Doctor, good performances and has some fine production values. While it has its faults, the fact that this was more or less a pilot does excuse some of the faults present. Looking back on the TV Movie nearly twenty years after it was made one thing is clear: it was the comeback that should have been.",1372723200,,4618,4.662162162162162

Just like the Challenger disaster set back space exploration by years, this monstrosity of a movie set Doctor Who way, way back, with a new series premiering not until almost a decade later in 2005. Think about how popular the new series is now...then think about how awful this movie had to be to delay a new Doctor Who series that already had a built-in, established audience.

The plot is sooooo generic, and like I already said, probably repurposed.

Grace was possibly the worst companion ever.  She had a good start when she rushed to help the Doctor, but she was stupid for not believing he could possibly have 2 hearts, which lead to his death.  And even stupider was how she didn't believe him even after all that happened after that.  I didn't feel the least bit sad when the Master killed her.  Bringing her & the Asian kid back was such a cop-out.  Still, there were some good moments.  The regeneration sequence was rather unique, I loved the bit where the cop on the motorcycle drove into the TARDIS only to drive back out when he realizes it's bigger on the inside & the theme is quite possibly my favorite theme for any of the Doctors.

The main reason, of course, is that this movie-- meant as a pilot for a Fox-backed series that never was, unfortunately-- is Paul McGann's only on-screen outing as the Eighth Doctor. This is a shame, because I love this regeneration-- his look, his personality, the HG Wells feel of his TARDIS. (The good news is that he lives on in many audio adventures.) Eric Roberts' Master, on the other hand, is a bit over the top-- though that's not necessarily a criticism for a Doctor Who villain!

Fans of this long-running series need to view (and possibly come to terms with) McGann's Doctor. This is their one chance, and once you get past the glaring gaffs (""I'm half-human on my mother's side."" ???), it's a fun romp with our favourite Time Lord.",1356825600,,1070,4.631578947368421

1619606,4,B00005KB4D,"This made-for-TV movie has been shown only once in the US in 1996.  Back then, I watched it in a hotel room while traveling and couldn't tape it.  Eventually I gave up hope that it would ever be released on DVD or VHS in the US and bought a PAL copy (from amazon.co.uk) to play on my ""hacked"" DVD player.  Murphy's Law being what it is, about a year later the US release finally came.  Accordingly, I haven't really gotten around to watching the US release until now.

As another reviewer pointed out, this is a NTSC-to-PAL-back-to-NTSC copy, so there is a bit of a speed-up that happens when NTSC is transferred to PAL.  You'll get used to that.  The US-release DVD has a lot of extras (more than a disc worth) that aren't on the UK-release DVD.  They're generally quite good.

I thought that Paul McGann was an excellent Doctor, even though he was stuck with a rather poor script.  The supporting cast is strong, especially Yee Jee Tso playing a young gangster who reforms when the Master turns out to be more evil than even a gangster can stand.  The production was classy for a TV movie of that era.

Then there's that script.  I quite agree that it was wrong to make the Doctor half human, and that there's too much time wasted on chases for an 85 minute film.  The opening voice-over tells us that the Daleks, having tried and executed the Master on Skaro, granted his last wish and gave his remains to the Doctor to be returned to Gallifrey.  Give me a break!!  Firstly, the Daleks don't bother with trials.  Secondly, they don't grant last wishes.  And thirdly, if the Doctor came within range of Daleks they would shout ""EXTERMINATE!""  Furthermore, one would think that a movie about time would have gotten the date of the millennium straight.  (OK, I know half the world's population thinks it started on January 1, 2000, but it didn't really start till January 1, 2001.)

1619607,5,B00005KB4D,"First and foremost I have to say this: Paul McGann was a really wonderful Eighth Doctor. I wish they really had done more with Eight in film or television.

I've been a Whovian (Doctor Who fan) for quite some time. The reboot with Eccleston was where I started with the show, but since I've seen all the New Who and gone back to see the classic stuff as well. The Eighth Doctor, as seen in this film, is the Doctor that ended up going to fight in the Time War (we don't see this in the film, however). Afterward he had to regenerate and we got Nine for the reboot (Eccleston). So I was always curious as to what sort of man went to fight in that war. Eight is definitely a romantic - in the modern sense and more time-period romanticism as well - but has his own really cool qualities/abilities that get introduced. The companion is very smart, we get another brawl with the supposedly-dead Master, and the world is in danger on New Year's eve. In fact, the Seventh Doctor (McCoy) makes a short appearance in the beginning before regenerating into Eight (McGann).

I would say this movie is a must for any Whovian. I even have showed it to people who aren't familiar with the series and they enjoyed it as well!",1350086400,,1211,4.353982300884955

I was a fan watching Doctor Who re-runs on PBS as a teen and loved it. Tom Baker was my first Doctor and, though other actors were very good, Tom is MY Doctor. Paul McGann does justice to the Doctor nicely and Eric Roberts is a top-notch actor very capable of pulling off the villain, though somewhat lacking the Master's ""I would like to be good, but can't"" warmth meant to make you like/dislike him. It's not a problem with the actors, but of the story itself. It's like the writers either held back (or were held back by FOX) or the best bits of the story got chopped out by TV execs who only care about the money.

1619622,3,B00005KB4D,"A cat has nine lives. Luckily for fans of Doctor Who, the time traveler many more. ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" was an attempt to revive the BBC TV franchise for both American and British audiences after the series run out of steam in the 1980's. While flawed with a script that tries to do too much (be a pilot for those who don't know the series, Americanize the story/character a bit and craft an entertaining TV movies that long time fans could also enjoy)and features enough plot holes for the Tardis to fly through, ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" succeeds because of the charming performance of Paul McGann. It's too bad this pilot didn't get picked up because McGann is marvelous (although he has quite a bit different interpretation compared to his predecessors)in the role and I have the feeling the series would have improved.

While transporting the remains of his nemesis The Master, the Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) crashes his sabotaged Tardis in San Francisco in 1999. Shot as he leaves the Tardis, The Doctor ends up in the hospital where Dr. Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook)tries to save his life causing the Doctor to regenerate (Paul McGann). The Master takes over the body of a paramedic (Eric Roberts)with a new goal--to take the Doctor's body because that's the only way he can survive.

Watch for a very clever reference to Tom Baker's Doctor.

While not the best Doctor Who movie I've seen, it's far from the worst and a marketed improvement over some of the ones that aired when Sylvester McCoy or Colin Baker ""inhabited"" the role in the 1980's. That said, you'll either like the film and be willing to over look the flawed script by Matthew Vaughn (""The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones"", ""The Emperor's New Groove)the direction is fairly solid by Geoffrey Sax (""White Noise"")keeping the story moving along at a nice pace. The main flaw here is that the Doctor who does quite a bit of detecting in the show does little here primarily running around.

The digital visual effects look dated but otherwise the production values (particularly for the redesigned interior of the Tardis)look quite nice (the TV film had a budget of $5 million MUCH bigger than anything the original series ever had).

The DVD transfer looks good although it comes with some problems; the darker scenes tend to bury detail in murkiness but colors look quite good. It's a pity we don't have a Blu-ray transfer of this but, I suspect, this was probably assembled on video. It would require a complete rescan/reassembly of the original film elements for the film to truly benefit from a high def transfer.

Audio sounds terrific with a nice, robust stereo mix.

The special features will wow most fans. We get visual effects reels produced prior to production; we also get a featurette ""The Seven Year Hitch"" (titled because of the seven year hiatus until the TV movie)with producer Phillip Seagal detailing his efforts to ""regenerate"" The Doctor.

""The Doctor's Strange Love"" focuses on how the TV movie has caught on with some members of the Who audience. ""The Wilderness Years"" details the books written that kept the character of The Doctor alive while the show was on hiatus for a decade. We also get ""Tomorrow's Times"" which focuses on the press coverage when McGann was announced as the new Doctor.

Two commentary tracks one with the director (which has long periods of silence)and one featuring actors McCoy and McGann are both interesting--the latter is quite lively. Nicholas Briggs moderates the discussion and trio play well of each other.

Although ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" isn't perfect it IS entertaining and features a charismatic performance by McGann (who really should have been considered for another chance to play the Doctor or at least a cameo in the rebooted series for a regeneration sequence).

I'd suggest Whovians give it a chance. Is it a great TV movie? No but it IS entertaining and even in its cheesy moments it's fun.",1304726400,5,3934,4.856716417910448

Comparing it to the more recent revival of the good Doctor, there are some serious malfunctions here. If you can keep Misters Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith out of it--(or maybe consider them the sequels they apparently ARE) there's a lot to admire here.

McGann is an enviable Doctor. Many people disparage the motorcycle chase scene, but I rather admired it. I chuckled while re-watching it thinking ""The Doctor has done fairy tales, monster movies, science fiction, and historical fiction--why shouldn't he do 'Smokey and the Bandit?'"" Besides, it was fun. I also appreciate that the producers included Sylvester McCoy into the procedings.

It is definitely a ""period"" piece though--reflecting some 90's sensibilities. The gang members look like they came straight out of ""21 Jump Street."" The Master's gooey CGI looks funny now.

It does make me a little sorry that McGann didn't have another try as the Doctor.",1303430400,,1052,5.1345029239766085

1619625,4,B00005KB4D,"First off, let me start out by saying that I don't understand the hate this film has gotten from fans over the years. Yes, this film starts off strong but goes into a slump in the second half. Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy and recommend here. Despite the shocking revelation that the Doctor is half human (I'm still not sure where they were going with this) and the Eye of Harmony being located inside the Tardis rather than on Gallifrey, it sticks fairly well to the Whoniverse previously established during the original show's 26 season run. The Time Lords, Gallifrey, Rassilon, the Daleks, and the Cybermen are all referenced either directly or indirectly. And 7th Doctor Sylvester McCoy was brought back one last time to pass the torch to incoming Doctor Paul McGann. Newcomers might have been confused by this, but I thought it was a lovely gesture to all us longtime fans who had stuck with the show through thick and thin. Visually, the movie was stunning, and still holds up well even today. The Tardis interior is spectacular, a Jules Verne inspired masterpiece that could never have been made on the original show's miniscule budget, and actually looks better than the Tardis interiors shown to us in the new series as well. And Paul McGann is just hellishly perfect as the Doctor. They could not have cast anyone better to take on the role, and he slips into the part with incredible ease. I think it is borderline criminal that he never got the opportunity to reprise the role on television ever again (although he has since played in Doctor Who audio dramas, showing what an excellent Doctor he would have made in a TV series). It's a shame that a series never came from this, but when watched in hindsight, it makes a good bridge between the original Doctor Who series and the new one that premiered in 2005. I'm just glad that it has finally gotten an official US release after all these years. He's back, and it's about time!",1301529600,,1948,4.649275362318841

Awkward writing, abysmal acting, dated and silly effects, uneven style, and plot holes you could fly the Tardis through, made this feel like a very slap-dash attempt at something that could have been SO MUCH better. An example of the ridiculousness: The doctor's two hearts on an x-ray are explained away as ""a double exposure"". Multiple times. Really??? Say, does anyone here in this HOSPITAL have a stethoscope? No? Oh, ok, nevermind.

Obviously your mileage may vary, but I would recommend saving your money & time (I'm lucky I got this from the library, so at least I didn't waste any money on it), and skip over this to go directly to the 2005 Doctor Who series.",1300147200,4,823,4.636986301369863

Pros: The Tardis has it's best interior in this. I love the steampunk version of the central console.
  One last outing with Sylvester McCoy, one of my favorite Doctors.
  Paul McGann's portrayal. Even though he only had this one shot in the visual medium (not counting books or audio adventures), McGann did my favorite portrayal of the Doctor.

Cons: The whole half human debacle.
  The Doctor's new penchant for physical affection. Maybe it's just my old school fandom kicking in, but until this movie I've never seen the Doctor kiss a companion. Wish it had stopped here.

The movie looks a little dated, but not as bad as some of the older series. If you are a Doctor Who fan, this is one you must have in your collection.",1299110400,3,826,4.489932885906041

The movie itself is good but shows some signs of trying to satisfy too many requirements of the various entities involved in its production. The love story could have been dispensed with, but I rate this movie highly nonetheless. Too bad it couldn't have developed into a new series, filling the gap between the original BBC Doctor Who stories and the new BBC series.

1619632,1,B00005KB4D,"An absolutely loyal and dedicated Doctor Who fan, I was glad to finally see the film marking the transition of the seventh to eighth Doctors.  Barely a few minutes into the picture, I was already full of righteous-indignation as I watched horrible actors doing horrible acting on horrible sets.  Eric Roberts really makes a Disney villain of the Master, even down to a sashay.  Of course, the story itself can be blamed as well.  Whose idea was it for the Master to incapacitate people with large amounts of ecru-colored bodily fluid?  This film was made to be made fun of.  It's the only way to get through it.  It's so bad that it feels almost as parodic as ""The Curse of the Fatal Death.""
  If you adore the Doctor, only watch this film while wildly incapacitated with drink or whatever.  If you're considering a foray into the world of Doctor Who, DO NOT EVER SEE THIS MOVIE, or at least wait until the brilliance of (fairly) recent episodes with Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith have completely converted you into a wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey TARDIS fan.  Wait even until after you've watched Patrick Troughton episodes.  Definitely watch Tom Baker's 4th Doctor before you see this.  Really, this film is so bad, it would make me automatically hate the ""franchise.""  I still don't know if I want to call the Eric Roberts' Master the ""Outrageously Gay Master"" or the ""Wanna-be Terminator Master.""  Perhaps the second is the same as the first.
  A die-hard fan might appreciate the picture, but even those friends of mine who listen to Doctor Who audiobooks and read Doctor Who comic books find this movie to be more torturous than Timelord.  Really, I want to erase this film from my mind.  Where's a sonic screwdriver when you need one?",1298678400,9,1738,4.752508361204013
1619633,4,B00005KB4D,"Yes, the plot is more inane than most Doctor Who plots.  At times it approaches the incomprehensible.  Why did his female companion turn all evil for those few moments at the end?  But who expects Doctor Who plots to be particularly logical?  After all we are dealing with a 900 year old alien who changes bodies periodically and travels time and space in a police phone box.  I found the story a lot of fun.  I enjoyed seeing the seventh doctor included, it lent continuity to the story line for the fans of the series.  Probably meant nothing to someone in America seeing Doctor Who for the first time though.  I really liked the 8th Doctor and wish he was in more films.  I have heard some of his audio CD's and am glad he is still part of the never ending song.  Given the technical values of the film and the action oriented pacing, I definitly consider this film to be part of the ""modern era"" as opposed to the ""classic era"" Doctor Who.  Paul McGann fits right in with Christoper Eccelson, David Tennant and Matt Smith.  You have never seen the TARDIS so huge or more gothic.  More like an old English mansion than a space ship interior.",1298419200,,1144,4.390476190476191
1619634,3,B00005KB4D,"Paul McGann's Doctor Who is a wonderful surprise. He embodies pathos, humor, and intelligence, much like Jon Pertwee and David Tennant. Where could this have gone? If only the TARDIS had been liberated to land all over the world - not just the U.K. or USA, but Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Thank you to Philip David Segal for the stubborn persistence in getting this thing made after the ten year ruination under the infamous John Nathan-Turner, that demented question-mark celery laden pox on Who.

Problems: The half-human issue. The Spielberg Strings. The Dirty Nerds in ""Strange Love."" Co-Producer Jo Wright attacks on Sylvester McCoy, who in fact did a great job! It's in poor taste, and a case of BBC ""smoke and mirrors,"" to attack Sly McCoy and his Doctor Who. The show's low ratings prior to cancellation were the result of the horrible disco/cutesy nonsense of John Nathan-Turner and his crew of BBC sanctioned Doctor Destroyers. Even the marvelous Radiophonic Workshop ruined the music under JNT's direction. What a shame. Back to this TV movie: The silly motorcycle chases. The unsubtle romance stuff. The repeated New Year's countdown. The female Doc's wardrobe. Eric Roberts' camp. The snake spit.

BUT the pluses outweigh these issues, especially Paul McGann's and Sylvester McCoy's acting. The surgery. The horror (though I don't have two hearts, I've woken up during surgery - well depicted). The regeneration scene is priceless. The humor and pathos. The Frankenstein movie. The interior of the TARDIS is FANTASTIC. Segal gets what the TARDIS is about. Infinite. Cozy. Cool. The Doctors (McCoy, McGann) both indulge in Jelly Babies, H.G. Wells, and vintage jazz. What might have been . . .

Note: Paul McGann is also excellent, with his brothers, in the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hanging-Gale/dp/B000CEV3MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hanging Gale</a>.",1298332800,5,1951,5.496666666666667
1619635,3,B00005KB4D,"I was kind of hoping the Doctor Who movie was going to be a case of, ""What was everyone talking about, this is really good!""  Well, it's not, but it's not horrible either.

One issue is with the continuity issues: I know many fans have an issue with the fact that the Daleks are holding a trial; Daleks don't' have trials, they exterminate.  That I don't have a problem, Davros is brought back to Skaro to be put on trial at the end of ""Revelation of the Daleks.""  But Skaro was destroyed at the end of ""Remembrance of the Daleks.""  Yes, I know one of the novels explains that away, but still.

Why would the Daleks put the Master on the trial?  I assume some untelevised story, but why would the Daleks be holding the trial?  And more importantly, why would they allow the Doctor to have the remains?  I'd think that the Daleks would exterminate him as soon as he came to collect the remains.

The Doctor being half-human?  The Eye of Harmony bit, the movie seemed to indicate that it was only located in the Doctor's TARDIS.  I thought it was on Gallifrey, and powered all TARDISes?  And seems he moved it from the cloister room to beneath the TARDIS controls sometime?

The plot is simplistic, but that's understandable - they're trying to sell it to an audience that unfamiliar with Doctor Who.

Eric Roberts as the Master.  Not horrible, but after watching Anthony Ainley, Roger Delgado, and John Simms... well, Eric Roberts seems to pale.  I like the continuity of taking over a human body, a la the classic series.  And we get to see the only time the Master appears in traditional Time Lord apparel.  Which apparently makes him act effeminate...

Paul McGann does a good job as the Doctor, though really he's only on-screen for really a short amount of time.

I was never a huge fan of Sylvester McCoy; I think in hindsight because I never liked any of his companions and he was in some really weak stories.  He's not in the movie that much, just in the beginning, but he's in it more than usual in any regeneration story.  Usually the previous act appears in the regeneration story for a few seconds (or at all, thinking back to ""The Eleventh Hour"" or ""Rose"").  Showing him enjoying himself in the TARDIS at the beginning was kind of neat.

I liked the redesign of the interior of the TARDIS (though, where did all the dead leaves in the cloister room come from?  And aren't having those lit torches a fire hazard?).  You can imagine the TARDIS being lived in and traveled in, not like the sterile way it was depicted starting with the second Doctor.  I think.  The way the TARDIS was depicted in the first Doctor stories, you could imagine living in it.

Anyway, I'd say it was a solid ""C"".  The extras were good, but I don't if you need to watch them more than once.  Maybe rent it on Netflicks, but I don't know if I'd call it essential to own it.",1297728000,3,2859,4.428023032629558
1619636,4,B00005KB4D,"This made-for-TV movie is a strange beast; the only episode of Doctor Who to be co-produced by Americans, it attempted (and failed) to relaunch the series for a multinational audience in 1996. Thus, many Doctor Who fans regard this movie as a weird aberration - America's lone, tacky contribution to the Doctor Who mythos, sandwiched uncomfortably between the original and relaunched British versions.

I don't quite share that negative view of this movie, however. As an American myself, I've always wanted to see Doctor Who take off in the U.S. - and this movie remains Who's only truly significant foray into the U.S. market. Such concerns aside, I also admire the movie for its slick production values and sense of fun. To me, this is still the best-looking Doctor Who production of all time, particularly in terms of sets (huge), extras (numerous), and direction (arty-farty).

Certainly, Matthew Jacobs' often-convoluted script needed some work; if you compare it to ""Caves of Androzani"" or ""Midnight,"" you're bound to be disappointed. But I'd still rather watch this movie than, say, anything involving the Quarks or the Slitheen - if only for Paul McGann's charismatic performance as the Eighth Doctor, and his awesome TARDIS interior.

But even for fans who hate the Doctor Who TV Movie, there should be no denying that this is a first-rate DVD package. The remastered movie itself looks and sounds great (why no Blu-ray version, I wonder?) But the real attraction is the huge array of special features. The longest is a documentary called ""The Seven Year Hitch"" about the movie's epic production history; though a little dry, it offers some compelling glimpses into the workings (and thought processes) of the BBC.

Another standout feature (not listed on the back of the DVD, oddly enough) is Paul McGann's audition tapes; these are particularly interesting, because he reads from a totally different script from the one ultimately used for the movie. Other cool features include: special effects tests for CGI Daleks; a featurette on press coverage for the TV Movie; another featurette on how interest in post-cancellation Doctor Who was sustained by books, comics, and fan videos; and a fun roundtable discussion in which three nerdy fans talk about what they like (and dislike) in the movie.

Overall, this is easily one of the best Doctor Who DVD releases, putting many Hollywood releases to shame; so even if you're lukewarm or hostile toward the movie itself, I'd consider picking it up.",1297382400,16,2504,5.082725060827251
1619637,4,B00005KB4D,"It has taken far too long for this TV special to be released, but finally it is here. While Hollywood made some unnecessary changes to the character, etc. this is still a very good movie. Paul McGann is fantastic as the 8th incarnation of The Doctor. While he has continued this role in audio (and it is included in novel form), if is a shame that the procucers of Doctor Who have not found a way to use him in the new series. Perhaps a special that gives us more on the time wars, and permits McGann to regenerate into the 9th Doctor.

Anyhow... that is another matter. Back to the movie. I really enjoyed McGann's character, and, even with the Hollywood adjustments, this story is a good one. The acting is good, and the ever present conflict between the Doctor and the Master is just as good as always. This is a must for any Doctor Who Fan's collection.",1297296000,2,857,4.35625

It's part BBC Doctor Who and part ""Hollywood"".  I didn't really look to see who worked on this movie, but if wasn't Hollywood studios I'll be surprised.  I've got nothing against Hollywood when they do their thing, but there are some things that just don't work as a Hollywood production or with a Hollywood feel.  Doctor Who isn't their thing.

The Doctor is put in charge of getting The Master's remains back to Gallifrey.  The remains get loose, hijack a human body and, of course, all hell breaks loose just in time for Y2K.  The Doctor and his human doctor must make things right less we face a real end of the world doomsday scenario.  And that's where the Hollywood feel comes into play.  Big car chases through San Francisco freeways (complete with chickens blocking traffic).  Big glitzy parties that the doctor's companion can just happen to get into when the doctor doesn't have his aliens tools handy.  Etc.

The doctor was great.  The Tardis was great.  Everything else was just okay and would not have worked in the series, not today anyway.

I don't really like most Hollywood Sci-fi or most action movies... the feel in those  movies that makes me not like them was all here.  But there's just enough of what makes Doctor Who, well, Doctor Who to allow me to still give it 3 stars.  It's okay. Just don't expect great things from it.

I kept hearing about how horrible this movie was, and how it nearly 'killed' Doctor Who.  Having gotten into the newer Doctor Who series, I decided to pick up the most recent predecessor.

I was expecting a horrible abomination of a movie, but Paul McGann was actually pretty good as the Doctor, considering the script he had to work with.  The TARDIS interior is amazing, I wish they would have kept it for the new series.

I think that the biggest problem with the movie is that BBC didn't stick to their guns and keep the series decidedly British, I think that's a large part of what makes the show so appealing.  Instead, they tried to make too many people happy and ended up with a movie that's a bit of a mess in spots.

Still, if you're a Doctor Who fan, this movie is definitely worth seeing.

My only real problem was that I didn't pay enough attention and didn't realize it was Region 2 when I ordered it.  Fortunately enough for me, I watch enough imports that it wasn't really much of an obstacle for me.",1292544000,3,1126,4.319047619047619

So ... FOX? ... makes sense ... do I like any of their current shows? IDK ... but they seriously need to hire some sci-fi geeks cuz they wouldn't know awesome sci-fi if it bit them in the collective butt LOL ... I would have LOVED to see an entire series ... it cracks me UP that they wouldn't wannabe a part of such a cult classic!

As a whole ... the movie with PM here ... it's standard american fare of the time ... sad that. Someone missed with the plot but it turns out ok in the end. It is a nice addition to the Who family and the Big Finish audio plays are amazing! Love the books!

There are several memorable moments in this movie ... one is the Doctor's kiss ... it paved the way for CE in the first season of the New Who to be a little more (I really have no idea how to eaplain it LOL) but yeah ... he is a litle more open to ""romance"" in the new series. IDK if I like that. BUT they've kept it to a minimum ... so I think it might be for the best that the new series is out of the UK ... we woulda had The Doctor hoppiing from bed to bed in no time.

Although it was a sad to watch Sylvester McCoy pass the sonic screwdriver, Paul McGann was/is the perfect Doctor.  Not only did he bring his own charm and presence to the role, he also reminded me of many of his incarnations that went before.  He sounded much like Peter Davison's Doctor, was as eccentric as Tom Baker's, and the motorcycle chase was very much in the mold of Jon Pertwee's ""man of action.""  Thankfully he was much more likeable than, uh, some of the other fellows.

  I thought the TARDIS was the finest, and is still the finest TARDIS that ever was- and if you look at the console design, the time rotor and support structures have been carried on to the new series, as well as the fast American TV style and emphasis on action, and the romantic nature of the Doctor. Looking back you can see the transition from the classic series to the new in this movie.

  I must dismiss the comments of the detractors of this movie.  Doctor Who previously was not (or should not have been) known for it's continuity. You could argue this move ""bends the laws of time"" a bit, but with the Doctor, that is to be expected. All I know is that my sons, before this movie, could not understand my fascination with Doctor Who.  They liked this movie, and are now fans of the Classic and new Series.

  My only real and true regret is that this movie was not the pilot for the Doctor Who Series that was to immediate follow.  I would say this film was way before it's time. (Well, about 10 years anyway.)",1290729600,5,1576,4.345890410958904

But the story, starting with the super-violent beginning was dumb from the get-go. The car chase was eye-ball rolling and the loss of the British sense of humor was unfortunate too.

What does that mean for US/Canada audiences?  As the TV movie was originally shot and broadcast in North American using the NTSC standard,  that means that this conversion is NTSC -> PAL -> and back to NTSC.  The feature presentation will suffer from PAL-speed up, running about 4% faster than originally broadcast on Fox back in 1996.  Perceptive viewers (who may have recorded this on VHS when it originally aired) will notice that everyone's voice is pitched slightly higher and that the movie runs faster (looking similar to how ""time-compressed"" airings of shows look on basic cable syndication).

Most American viewers probably won't even notice the changes but they are there nonetheless and the more perceptive (or pedantic) fans will notice.  Still, with that said, the extras package looks great and I can forgive the PAL speed up (I'm used to it by now, having imported the Region 2 DVD release years ago).",1289952000,69,1189,4.91

Over 14 years after its production and broadcast, the Doctor Who TV Movie starring Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor will finally see release in North America!!!

This 2-disc release will be on Tuesday, February 8th, 2011 for the suggested retail price of $34.98, under the title: Doctor Who - The Movie - Special Edition. 2entertain's Commissioning Editor Dan Hall revealed this surprise news on the ""Hoo on Who"" podcast (available on iTunes) on August 25. He was successful in negotiating release rights for this production outside of the UK that had previously been held by the co-producers of the TV Movie, Universal Television. This clears the way for a release in North America by BBC Worldwide Americas.

 The version that will see release is a new edition that was made available in the UK in October as part of what they're calling the Revisitations Box Set, where three previously available titles were re-released together with boosted extra features. The McGann TV Movie is one of them. The others will see release in North America later in 2011.

 For those of you who don't know, ""the TV Movie"" as it is called was a one-off attempt to revive Doctor Who in 1996 as a ""back door pilot"" for the Fox Network in the U.S. It was a co-production by Universal Television, BBC Worldwide Americas, and Fox.

In it, we see the Seventh Doctor regenerate into the Eighth, and embark on an adventure to save the Earth from being destroyed by the TARDIS after the Master opens its power source, on the eve of the new millennium. Ratings on Fox were not strong enough to warrant a series, and nothing else happened with the TV rights until 2005, although the McGann Eighth Doctor continued on in the spinoff fiction of original novels, audio dramas, and comic strips, all of which will be highlighted in the extra features on the upcoming DVD:

Disc 1

 86 minute movie with stereo audio.

So over all, while the classic series was a case of good plot, poor special effects, this outting is more a case of good special effects, OK plot. But as afar as regeneration stories go this is one of the best. McGann makes an impressive start to what may be a brief reign as the Doctor. After a seven year wait (and despite the confusing final two acts) there is still much in this production that pleases. Trust me, it could have been worse.",1289174400,168,6772,4.913656387665198
1619648,5,B00005KB4D,"Finally, we get a US release of the Paul McGann TV Movie. For all its failings, we get an awesome Doctor, Paul McGann (my favorite, hands down), and a Doctor Who story with the appropriate production values and budget(shades of what was to come in 2005). A great performance by Eric Roberts as the Master as well, with solid turns from Daphne Ashbrook and Yee-Jee Tso to boot. I'd like to think that this film paved the way for the 2005 revival, when everything went back into the hands of the BBC,an intelligent BBC, not like the STUPID BBC from the 1980's. It would be great to see McGann reprise the Eighth Doctor in the new Matt Smith series. One can hope.............",1288915200,6,672,4.516393442622951

This has been a much sought-after release for all Doctor Who fans 'across the pond'. The original DVD release of this story, back in 2001, was held from the US. This was due to the fact that so many different companies were holding the release rights, namely, the BBC, BBC Worldwide, and the US makers of Universal. After what was said to have been easy talks between the BBC and Universal, we are finally getting to own this DVD without having to order it from the UK.

However, as compared with other Dr. Who storylines it's a bit below what I have come to expect.  Most Dr. Who storylines are pretty engaging.  So it's not bad, it's just not superb.  I felt that The Five Doctors was a lot better.  Of course another problem I had with it is the encoding.  None of my DVD players would play the movie.  I could get the computer to play it after I made an adjustment but the point is I shouldn't have to do that.  I don't understand why DVD's are encoded for specific regions.

1619653,3,B00005KB4D,"Paul McGann does excellent narratives and the prolouge, to me is the best part of this ""movie""..  yet that said, Paul McGann comes across clearly to the audience unlike Sylvester McCoy did in his rein when he actually was the Doctor in the ""old"" adventures(1987-89)  I think McCoy's performance is best right here, much better than when he was the doctor.  What little you see is quite well done and personally I think it was a good Idea to add him for continuity's sake for the regenoration, and for respect to us old fans too, instead of just having it start with Paul McGan as in ""where in hell did he come from"" like with Ecceleston. Most will disagree but I am an old fan so that don't mean squat.  Ashbrook is odviously a true american, not a portrayl like Nicola Bryant who's accent was(by my american standpoint) a bunch of b.s.  Why is it you brits(""billyboys) always portray us as straddling ""canadians"" we hate canadians, they are as prissy as you think we are! anywhoo, the ""beginning of the end"" meaning, the plot is slopped over for the glitzy special effects, while good, should be a tool to add to the plot, not a crutch for a lazy workforce and writers who just ""go over it' too enthused with the new tech of CGI!

1619654,5,B00005KB4D,"Fox's loss is the BBC gain. I wonder what would've happened if Paul McGann (Doctor number 8) had gone to series back in '96. Would we be thrilling over the adventures of David Tennent (Doctor number 10)? Would the show have out lasted the last Millennium? All I can say is that when this TV movie/Back door Pilot aired in the summer of '96 I was exstatic and I was not dissappointed! This movie acts as the bridge between the classic series and the current series, updating the visuals FX and adding a dash of sexy cool. The Doctor (Sylvester McCoy, Doctor number 7), while transporting the remains of his old enemy the Master (Eric Roberts ""The Dark Knight"" TV's ""Heroes""), is forced to land the TARDIS in San Fransico China Town on new years eve 1999. He dies, regenerates, battles the wonderfully deranged Master, snoggs his companion and saves the planet. Classic Doctor Who with maybe a bit too many refrences to the classic series but still worth owning for any true fan. It's so long Sylvester McCoy and hello Paul McGann (whose likeness was featured on the novels, comics and whose voice was featured in animated web casts and radio drama as current as 2007 has the least amount of screen time for any actor who has played the Doctor but remains the longest name attached to the character to date). It's a shame that we didn't get to see more from this underated actor in a fantastic performance. Considering we never actually saw the 8th Doctor die and regenerate into the 9th (Chrisopher Eccelston) who's to say the Mr. McGann's days as the Doctor are truly over? hint hint Mr. moffat. And when the hell is this going to be released in Region 1?",1252886400,4,1655,4.575757575757576
1619655,2,B00005KB4D,"I missed the original broadcast of this made-for-US-TV-movie, and it took me thirteen years and watching every available episode from 1963-1989 before I watched it. When it was on in 1995 or 1996 I'd heard that the Doctor would get romantic with this companion at the insistence of FOX, which figured that without any sexuality it would never sell in the US. You see, the Doctor was accompanied by a few dozen young women (and some men) in the original series. A lot of the young women were very fetching, from the First Doctor's Barbara Wright to the Seventh Doctor's Ace. But never, in twenty-five years, was there any hint of romance between Doctor and companion. Until FOX got ahold of the Doctor. Now granted, the romance is pretty forced and limited in the 1996 special, but it's there.

Then there's the Master, and Eric Roberts convinces us that both the Doctors and the Master should only be played by BRITISH actors. Roberts spends most of the movie looking like Lou Reed circa the mid-eighties until he ends up in a laughably outragous Dracula getup later in the film. He is menacing and mean but displays not one iota of the flair that Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley brought to the role. He just comes off as a well-spoken yet dim-witted thug.

Paul McGann equits himself well in the role, almost like a younger version of the First Doctor: befuddled and lacking a sense of humor. Still, it's passable for a one-shot, and he certainly would have developed his Doctor if the series had been taken up in 1996. He did come off as an American stereotype of Dr. Who, with his Victorian appearance and the gaudily decked-out TARDIS.

My biggest regret about not seeing the broadcast originally was missing a major network appearance by Sylvester McCoy. McCoy was wonderful in his years as the Seventh Doctor, but FOX gave him no lines and barely any action in this film. McCoy is just filling in time for McGann, and if they'd used a different actor it would have been all the same to FOX's target audience. McCoy should have been given some lines, but perhaps they felt that if he expressed himself, the audience might become attached to him and miss him when McGann made his entrance. Can't upstage the star, you know.

Anyway, while many 'classic' Doctor Who episodes do come up short, there is always the character of the Doctor to carry one through thin plot lines and not-so-special effects. Here we have a one-shot with insufficient time to appreciate this Doctor. And kissing one of the least appealing companions he'd had doesn't make it any better (apologies to the actress, but the character of Grace was just annoying).

The Doctor is 'half-human'? No. That might work on Vulcan (especially when the human mother apparently looks like Winona Ryder) but NOT on Gallifrey. Two stars for McGann's committed performance and for including Sylvester McCoy. Zero stars for everything else.",1247011200,4,2902,4.7844311377245505
1619656,5,B00005KB4D,"Due to complex copywrite issues, this film has never been released in the U.S. since its 1996 television premiere...until now! Finally, a DVD is going to be released in 2011. It has only been aired once in the U.S. and never been shown again nor has it ever been released on home video in the states before now. It is the only on-screen appearance of Eighth Doctor Paul McGann, and the only Dr. Who ever produced by an American company.

Now the story does have its problems, and doesn't quite deserve five stars, but it's still a great adventure that deserved to be released long before now which is why I'm giving this DVD release five stars. Some of the problems include some continuity errors in the story and some unanswered questions. But over all, it does have a great action-packed story with some great directing and performances. I still found it to be highly enjoyable.

The Plot:

The Master is executed on the Dalek planet Skaro. His last request was for his arhenemy, the Doctor, to take his remains back to their home planet of Gallifrey. As the Doctor put it ""It was a request they should never have granted.""

The Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy is on his way to Gallifrey with the Master's remains. But the Master has managed to somewhat regenerate into an oozing snake-like creature and sabotages the TARDIS, causing it to make an emergency landing on Earth in the year 1999.

Upon arrival, the Doctor gets caught in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out and gets shot forcing him to regenerate into Eighth Doctor Paul McGann. The Master has taken over the body of an ambulance driver played by Eric Roberts. But the body won't last long. With a quickly disintergrating body, the Master intends to take over the Doctor's body by opening and using the TARDIS's power source, the Eye of Harmony. But with the Eye opened, it threatens to suck the Earth through it. Now the Doctor and new companion Dr. Grace Holloway must race against time to save the planet.

1619657,3,B00005KB4D,"As the BBC continues to chrun out the latest series and it's spinoffs they are also remastering (where possible) vintage Who.  Why BBC doesn't release this one astonishes me as it ws a recent produciton so it can't need that much work and all the principles are alive for commentary.
This film originally airing in the US on Fox in the late 90's was supposed to introduce the Doctor to the US audience widescale (I guess the miyriad of PBS shows that made Dr Who reruns a staple in pledge drives in the 80's made someone think it could work).
And it might have if ever given a chance.  The film was a regeneration episode which are usually marred by weak plots anyway.  it was further muddled by too many cooks in the kitchen.  it is obvious studio execs wanted this to ""feel"" like other fox shows of the time.
Mcgann is excellent and evne Eric Roberts is good (and he usually annoys me as he overacts worse than Shatner).  I was lucky enough to tape it on original broadcast and it occasional airs on STARS.  Worth the 2 hour sit down if you cna see it and if you can watch a r2 or it is released in the US it is worth buying",1222128000,2,1126,4.213953488372093
1619658,2,B00005KB4D,"I remember watching this when it aired, and how bitterly disappointed I was in it.  I had a feeling that they were going to try and ""Americanize"" the Doctor, and I was right.

It starts off with the Master's trial on Skaro (!).  In Doctor Who folklore, that would never happen.  The Daleks would never have a trial for The Master.  The Daleks would more than likely have a trial for the Doctor, who was their arch enemy.  It goes downhill from there.  Eric Roberts is the Master here, and he doesn't really know how to play a renegade Time Lord.  He can be a good actor with good material, but this TV movie was a bone headed decision from the beginning.

There are too many special effects (and violence) in this, making it uncomfortable to watch at times and it has none of the wit and intelligence of vintage Doctor Who.  Despite having low expectations going in, the makers of this still managed to exceed those low expectations.

On the plus side, Paul McGann is wonderful as the Doctor, and it's a shame that when they started the series again in the U.K., they didn't put him in it as the Doctor.  And it also stinks that in the series' folklore, McGann counts as a regeneration.  He only played the role once, for crying out loud!  Oh, well.
