5616547,5,B00BGI07NK,VEEP SEASON 2 IS A JOY TO WATCH. IT'S FUNNY AND IN GOOD TASTE. POLITICS NEVER WAS SOOOO FUNNY! GREAT. CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 3.,1397088000,,126,4.08
5616548,5,B00BGI07NK,"...It's a winner in my book.  I love Julia Louis Dreyfuss, best comedic actress out there.  Loved her since her Elaine days on Seinfeld.  The supporting cast of Veep is second to none.  Best comedy in my opinion.  Witty, crude, funny....""I'm an angry bird, and you're a...pig"".  classic!  love, love, love this show.  Long live the Veep!",1397001600,4,337,4.7894736842105265
5616549,1,B00BGI07NK,"Having read about Veep in the New York Times interview with Nancy Pelosi and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, I thought I ought to watch an episode.  Whatever happened to intelligent and clever writing? Is using the f-word every other sentence supposed to be clever?  Forceful?  Who knows.  Not only is the writing bad, the story line is predictable and dull.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a fine actress; she deserves better than this shallow and superficial vehicle  for her considerable talents.",1397001600,4,480,5.1688311688311686
5616550,4,B00BGI07NK,"Humorous intrigue and back stabbing, not the heavy soul disturbing wretches of humanity we find in House of Cards. Julia is delightful an supported well by a cast that keeps it fresh. Nobody has it together. The tunnel vision folly of our endlessly self-seeking political class is the grist for this sitcom mill.",1395964800,2,312,4.90566037735849
5616551,5,B00BGI07NK,"I LOVE this show, this was another great season and look forward to seeing the next shows of this Great series.",1395705600,,111,4.333333333333333
5616552,5,B00BGI07NK,"Many of us have become cynical in relation to our political system. This hilarious series created by Armando Ianucci, who created British TV's In the Thick of it, speaks to that cynicism with a great result. These political animals aren't the heroes of hope and change they purport to be, but are remarkably fallible and human. They squabble, they spar, they grovel, and they shove each other aside for recognition. But all is done with a light hand and a comedic touch. The language is profoundly filthy and would be off putting if not so damn funny. You can just imagine say, Joe Biden speaking this way behind closed doors. Julia Louis Dreyfus is remarkable in her third star turn in a series, she is just immune to type casting, rising to every occasion with originality and wit. The whole cast is exceptional, in fact. There are two stand outs for me in supporting roles. Tony Hale deservedly won the Emmy for playing the VP's bumbling, and too eager to pleas ease personal aide Gary with charm.  Her personal assistant is her gatekeeper and is played by Sufe Bradshaw. She is the one person who prides herself on being above the fray and her no nonsense personality drops the other characters straight into their skirmishes and foibles. Part of me imagines that this is the way Washington really works behind the scenes.",1395619200,14,1326,4.7155172413793105
5616553,5,B00BGI07NK,"I absolutely love this show. I only started watching it because I heard Tony Hale and JLD were in it, and with them how could it not be funny. But the rest of the cast is perfect in their roles and they work so well together. I love that the show is quick, funny, and has great acting. I mean it's just hilarious and brilliant. I've heard some people not like it because of the language, but come on, it's HBO and it just makes it even more hilarious because the characters don't how to interact with people without being so vulgar. Season two is just as brilliant as season one and this is one of the best and funniest comedies on television.",1392422400,2,643,4.235772357723577
5616554,5,B00BGI07NK,"like most five star shows which are working, this one too has a great talent behind the scenes, creator and writer Armando Iannucci. He was inspired to create this show after creating a UK show,  ""The Thick of It,"", which was expanded into a film,  ""In The Loop"" which brought the THICK'S Malcom (main character playedmby Peter Cipaldi) to the USA. i have seen all of the Iannucci shows and film and they are all excellent.

he faced two huge problems in bringing this show to the USA.  one, we have a different political system to satirize.  although we are both democracies, the structures of our governments are quite different. two, british humor is different and is an acquired taste for non-Britains.

some are complaining about the swearing in this american show.  it is NOTHING in comparison to the swearing in the british show. Malcolm, the lead character in the UK sho,w is a swearing machine compared to Selena in the American show.

this second season hits the show's stride.  it builds upon and improves the already quite good first season. one of the very best comediennes in the business, Julia Louise-Dreyfus, plays Selena, vice president of the United States. She'd like to be president but it is hard to achieve that when the president acts for the most part as if you don't even exist. Selena is vain, independently wealthy, unsuited for marriage but quite lusty, and only informed on many issues as well as her staff briefs her on them. Any sane person would hate to be dependent on her staff as their primary concern, to a person, is keeping Selena's image bright for their futures, rather than really knowing anything about issues of the day.

what this show satirizes, just like its UK counterpart did, is the downside of democracies.  Because these people are elected by majority vote, their top concern is always image spin--how they are playing to the electorate.  they are in a state of constant turmoil and have trouble completing tasks because burnishing their images takes all of their time and effort.  they are running for re-election their entire time in office, much more than they are involved in laws, issues and governance.  I think this is a central truth about having a democratic government and why we currently find ourselves in gridlock in government.

5616556,1,B00BGI07NK,"Do you have ridiculous, inane conversations every single day with low level thinkers?  Add them all up over the last forty years and that's what this movie is about.  It's a pretense at mirroring the political life of the conniving, shallow liars that are 'serving' us through our governments.  Not funny, not entertainment, at best, it's merely a reminder of how despicable our fellow man chooses to be.  Then add in f-bombs and every other curse word thinkable thrown in every 14 seconds (I counted), and what do we have?  We've got a dvd that's giving us witness to the depraved minds of follywood and what these evil minds produce.  We've all known them for the kings and queens of drugs, alcohol, control, sex, homosexuality, nudity, vulgarity, murder, rape, abduction so say what it is.  What they've become behind closed doors is what they produce.  To them, it's 'normal'.  To those who have been watching and listening to their evil for years it has now become 'normal' to you.  GONE is morals, integrity, honesty, truthfulness, uprightness, fairness, peace of mind, beauty.  God said what we see, listen to, hear, touch is what we become.",1506470400,,1148,4.865979381443299

Even for a viewer such as myself who values obscenity, the writing and dialogue in Season Two perhaps over-obscenified itself.  Individual performances had their shine, but in some way, Season Two lacked the lustre of Season One.  As mentioned above this may have been second year slump.

5616577,4,B00BGI07NK,"Veep is a well-written, well-acted original show and generally funny in a dry, realistic way that Julia Louis-Dreyfus, nonetheless, manages to make hilarious at times. It's really well-produced, the sets are amazing and realistic, the casting is spot on and the characters are very distinctive. There's some one-liners that are just gold and some of the obscure references are very funny if you pick up on them. This is the smartest show I've seen.

The show works well when it remembers it is supposed to be a comedy. When it tries to be too realistic and wonky, as it does toward the end of season 2, it gets tiresome. As other reviewers have pointed out the cussing is just too excessive. Sure, I learned a few creative funny insults (!) but when seemingly EVERY OTHER LINE has an F-bomb or S-whathaveyou, you just tire your audience. Veep is (or tries) to offer a realistic view of the back-stabbing and back-dealing nature of DC politics but how long can the over-cussing, overly-narcissistic, self-involved people not being funny keep your attention? Toward the end of the season there are moments where Veep doesn't seem to know why you should you keep watching it (cut to George Constanza saying ""because it's on TV!"") Dan Egan, for example, is not supposed to be likable, but you have to give the audience some way to connect and relate to the characters and the show's writing doesn't help. It's like watching the ""Joffrey and Ramsays Half Hour of Not Funny Comedy Comedy Show.""  If it's a comedy then be funny, not serious. For such a smart show Veep don't seem to notice where it fails.

The show follows an arch and the story always moves forward. If you watched Season 2 and are on the fence give the future seasons a try. Sure, Veep will continue trying to shake off its unnecessary seriousness but it gets more interesting, funnier and will bring in new and funny characters (Richard Splett is hilarious!). It's still one of the best shows on TV.",1486598400,,1962,4.6976744186046515

Otherwise, they can stop using soooo many ""f"" words & that one senator who has an aide that wears glasses (Wilson?) doesn't need to be sooooo mean to him.  My problem with this show is that it models behavior/attitude b/c of their narcissistic sense of power to be cruel to their staff.  And then the staff does the same thing to their cohort. If this goes on in real life, it needs to stop.  If it doesn't, then why are the writers doing it?",1483315200,,481,4.311111111111111

When that ship sails, she instead is able to secure the position of The Vice President. It is all about the inner workings of her office. There is a lot of back biting amongst the staff and quite a bit of swearing by all cast members. Despite her great efforts, no matter what bill Selena backs or what function she attends something always goes wrong which results in bad press. This is a series you have to watch for a while to understand all the characters and their roles.

5617077,3,B00BGI07NK,"I really wanted to like this show. I like all the actors/actresses who star in it, but it's too plausible and Louis-Dreyfus' character is not particularly relatable. What I mean by this is that political comedies in the vein of Alpha House are funny to me because while the events they depict theoretically could happen, they're so bizarre and tangled that it ends up funny. The characters each display a different flaw and take turns poking fun at themselves and each other. In Veep, I got more of a sense that Louis-Dreyfus' character was a portrayal of an actual politician. Her flaws are mostly vanity and self-preoccupation, neither of which viewers want to relate to. Her treatment of her daughter in Season 1 was particularly unfunny to me, even if it is accurate. I feel as though the acting is phenomenal, but the plot doesn't quite live up to it.

5617146,5,B00BGI07NK,"Veep is the best in so many ways -- in its conception, by its writing, with its character development, and through its performers -- top notch acting at every level, both in.supporting roles and in leading roles -- the best ever.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus genuis makes this show an iconic story, per Americana.

Guile is absent with this show. The characters are hardly just comic figures but represent humans as they are: loveablly flawed.

Irony, paradox, and hypoctrsy are the components making up the fabric of reality. Veep demonstrates its version of reality excellently.

(Anyone stealing the last line will be hunted down and shot :-)

Of note is the character Jonah, a character a viewer will want to hate for he's so crudly obnoxious.

Surprisingly, extended over the duration of the show's 5 seasons, Jonah's character development transforms. In the finally season Jonah becomes the poster-child for idiots who succeed because of beliving in one's self. Fasinating to view this development from episode to episode, season to season. A must see for anyone who cares about excellent character development.

Mark Twain would love Veep were he alive right now. I know so. He told me. And I am not crazy, ever...hold on a minute, I must take my medication. Pardon me. I'll be back.

As you should do right now, come back to Veep even after watching seasons two and one for ""free"" through Prime, which is the best -- Prime. Your purchasing the other seasons is an investment in your edifying entertainment.",1477094400,,1506,4.924901185770751

5617595,5,B00BGI07NK,Originally I passed on this series for some reason. However after reading that JLD had won 4 consecutive Emmy awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series I gave it a go. Glad I did. Funny as hell... of course there seems to be F words flying every other minute so if that offends you go somewhere else. For the rest of the world enjoy a great comedic performance. Season 2 is slightly better than Season 1 as the backstabbing rivets up a notch or two.,1473724800,,462,4.32183908045977

One or 2 comments is okay here and there, but this show is nothing but constant vulgarity which gets very, very old very, very quickly.  I think the show is maybe trying to be funny, but the humor just isn't there as it appears they're all trying too hard and missing the mark.  I thought this would be a good show, but it's pretty pathetic and, hopefully, does not reflect our true government.  I got the impression that they're trying to portray the VP position if Sarah Palin had become the VP, but if that were the case, they probably should have gone with more of her subtle examples of what being naive looks like and then it would have been funny.

Of course there's the editing and all that creative tech stuff necessary to put a show together but the heart of everything beats with the actors and the writing. Superb! Julia&Co should get awards for each episode. Like I said, I'll keep it short, but it's hard not to acknowledge excellence in 25 words-ish....",1468540800,,468,4.790123456790123

5618226,4,B00BGI07NK,I really like the cast of this show... Even the characters who you can't stand (almost all of them are self centered backstabbers) are great just because the actors are all perfect for the roles they play. They can make you laugh just by a look or gesture. The writing is funny (sometimes a bit juvenile but thats par for a lot of comedy shows). We just started watching this show a couple of weeks ago and have been binge watching every chance we get. The only thing I don't like is the Veep's relationship with her daughter. I feel so sorry for her that it's hard to see the humor in any scenes where she is interacting with Selena. If it weren't for that heartbreaking relationship maybe I would rate the show a 5.,1468540800,,717,4.318518518518519

I certainly don't know any.
Beep is well written and well acted and I don't see anyone else pulling off this character other than Julia LD. Her physical acting reminds me a great deal of Lucille Ball. She's a true professional, with nearly perfect timing, and a genius comedic sense. It was hard to give her a chance after Seinfeld but JLD clearly has more than one character up her presidential pant suit. The show wouldn't work without an equally neurotic supporting cast of characters. Dreyfus is truly among contemporaries of her own skill level.",1468540800,,838,4.7465753424657535

This is a world where no good deed goes unpunished and, gratefully, the same goes for bad deeds as well.

If you've ever attended a live comedy show with a low-brow audience, these are the types of characters, situations and crude humor that work well. There has been some brilliant work done in this vein. This, somehow, does not rise to that level..

I'm sure that this will win many Emmy's because the standard for TV humor is pretty low in general. Maybe if I had been drunk or stoned or saw it with a ""guffaw"" type audience, I would have enjoyed it more.

5618768,4,B00BGI07NK,Show is very good but watching it on Amazon Prime Video Stinks.

5619056,4,B00BGI07NK,"As one who have been elected to office eight times I find the portrayal of elected officials while being humorous to be uncannily accurate. It shows why most will do anything to either be elevated to a higher office or to maintain the office they hold. They become addicted to the power and prestige and to having people bow before them and tell them how great they are. Their priorities are always first their position, then their political party which provides their position, and much further down the list the good of their constituents and their country. So while being very humorous I find it, at the proverbial end of the day, depressing.",1464739200,,645,4.716814159292035

My main complaint about season 1 was how incompetent her team was over and over again, and season 2 didn't stray far from this. I still enjoyed watching JLD as the VP struggling to make her mark, but I would have enjoyed more character development with the supporting cast. You see the writers attempt to do this with the introduction of Amy's family and Gary's girlfriend and even the plotline about Mike's debt, but none of these really further any of the supporting characters.",1464652800,,595,4.570093457943925

Julia has become a treasure of the american comedic scene. She is the show and watching her is nothing if not a pleasure and i know of no better way of closing out a hard day with plenty of laughs. I am not a fan of the cussing and could use a lot less of it but the show is great fun and i do the best i can to ignore it.

5619553,4,B00BGI07NK,"PRO:  This is a well-crafted comedy.  As with any serial show, success depends on effective character development, and in the short amount of time provided in each episode, we get vital glimpses into the primarily quirky characters of the main participants.  Consequently, I found myself binge-watching multiple episodes at a sitting.

CON:  Like so many cable productions today, VEEP illustrates the regretful lack of imagination on the part of the writers and producers as they pander to the lowest common audience denominator - four-letter profanities and vulgarities ... of which there are more than enough here to satisfy even the most ardent four-letter junkie.  To what purpose?  It neither adds to the story line,nor reflects life accurately,  The truth is, most people never ever speak like that in public, least of all in a professional setting such as this. Because of this, VEEP leaves us with the disquieting impression of what might have been - that is, great comedy that breaks from the starting gate at full gallop and holds its position to the finish-line ...  rather than the writing crutch that profanity/vulgarity/inuendo overload actually is here.  That's why shows like I LOVE LUCY, CHEERS, SEINFELD, etc. will be around forever.  They are, and will remain, examples of great writing without any artificial support.

CONCLUSION:  VEEP has earned a 'crutch' penalty of 30%, giving it 3.5 stars.  But since we cannot graphically represent 3 1/2 stars on this site, and since I am the sole umpire on the playing field of this review, I hereby rule that VEEP's 3 1/2 stars will be rounded up to the next whole star.  Consequently, VEEP now has a four-star review to accompany it's four-letter dialogue, along with it's four-letter name.  That is all.",1463270400,,1768,5.044827586206897

But I did decide to view season two while home sick and finding nothing more appealing after a few days of, undoubtedly, watching too many old movies on Roku.
I found it marginally better. But if even one character should show an emotion other than a lust for self-aggrandizement, it would provide an interesting contrast and make the plots so much more interesting.
I realize that ""Veep"" is fictional and intended to be entertaining, But, if everyone in Washington is as bad as it portrays, I am amazed that those who produce it have not departed for almost any other nation. Unless, of course, those responsible are squirreling their earnings away ""offshore"" in anticipation of the day when ""leaders"" such are portrayed cause this nation's total collaple.",1462492800,,866,4.938356164383562

Speaking of the ever invisible POTUS Julia's character at one point says, ""I'd like to break his back but how do you do that with someone who's backbone is Jello?"" Obviously I would highly recommend this series-as in most situation comedy series to be successful over multiple seasons you have to have a cast that works seamlessly so that you can't imagine the series without one of the actors/characters in place to make it all work.

I said that I loved the series as being very funny and also very well acted.  However I questioned the use of the familiar 4-letter word starting with ""f...""so many times.  That in my opinion, the show would be just as funny without the excessive use of that specific word over, and over and over.

Season 2 continues to follow the exploits of the ""VEEP"" Selina Meyer (played by the wonderfully talented Julia Louis-Dreyfus).  The entire cast works well together and the scripting is near perfect.  I don't want to give away any plot points, but suffice it to say that if you enjoyed Season 1 you will love Season 2. If you haven't seen it and you are the type of person who like a comedy that doesn't insult your intelligence and doesn't need a ""laugh track"", give it a look.",1462320000,,637,4.372881355932203

I could go on about the writing, the pacing, the physical humor, the incredible cast and how well this ensemble works together and off each other. You can watch these episodes over again and pick up incredibly funny things you missed the first or second time.

However, Amazon's streaming service does a disservice to Veep by cutting off the credits at the end. During the credits, there is still a little bit of the show going on. It's worth seeing, but Amazon's streaming cuts it off. On my Roku it says I  can hit a back key to hide the little icon showing ""next episode"" but it never works.

The combination of writing , characterization and acting is significantly higher than any other series (except possibly the Sopranos).  I'm surprised that Series 2 is even better than Series 1, but it is. This has happened with slight alterations in various characterizations, and allowing each episode to focus on the dynamics among differing characters. This is ""The Office"" for our snarky, sly, sarcastic and guarded generation. Did I mention cynical?!!
  And I love all the sweating. Love that Selena gets to sling the curse words with the best and worst of them.  Also appreciate the many Ways that Selena alternately is baffled, crazy angry, embarrassed or humiliated. Yet she always manages to come out on top. Love that a woman, and specifically a woman like Selena (read Hillary or Nancy Pelosi) triumphs and shows that she can govern, in spite of failure all around, rank pettiness, and meretricious persiflage the rule of the day.

Watching it the first time through I focus on the plot, while on repeat viewings I have a chance to catch all of the witty and snarky lines. I find I enjoy the plot lines more than season 1. I enjoy the lighthearted poking fun at the government for what happens when the government is unwilling to compromise, especially given the current political situation. Other plot lines touch humorous look deeper issues such as the repercussions of rescuing hostages or how taxing politics on one's personal life. Definitely worth a watch(or ten).",1461715200,,599,4.769230769230769

5620630,5,B00BGI07NK,"In case you are wondering why one might buy the Blu-ray version of Veep, here's 3 reasons:

[1] Extra/Bonus/Special Features: There are extensive deleted scenes for each episode, a few of them fairly long.

[2] Veep is the type of show that I will want to watch more than once. A year from now I may remember the storylines, but likely not the zingers that will make laugh again.

[3] Why did I spend extra $ for crisp picture quality when it's only a sitcom? Well, because Anna Chlumsky (Amy, the Vice President's Chief of Staff) is so damn cute and I want to see her face in high resolution. (Is that creepy?)

As for why you'd want to watch Veep at all: there are already 86 five-star reviews written, so don't just take my word for it.

Bravo and Julia and the cast are FANTASTIC.",1399334400,,281,4.875

5620728,4,B00BGI07NK,"...well performed by a cast of top actors. That round the clock  zinger humor is not easy to do.

5620732,5,B00BGI07NK,"Veep is the fast paced, satirical, hilarious look inside the workings of Washington.  You just have to wonder how many nuggets of truth each show contains.

Not for the easily offended, because the F-bombs do fly, but come on..do you think Washington is really G rated behind the scenes?!?",1397260800,4,353,4.571428571428571
