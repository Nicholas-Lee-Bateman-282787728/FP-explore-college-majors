8261965,4,B0016APX28,"A sobering critique of modern capitalism, culture, and human nature. Petzold's film explores morality and motivation. Wolfsburg is a city founded by the third reich to build cars for the new German future. Its use as the title underlines the rotten core that can be found hidden behind the cement and steel of modern cities, and even in our own minds. This film will keep you thinking for days.",1364169600,5,394,4.72463768115942
