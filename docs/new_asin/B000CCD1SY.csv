2457000,4,B000CCD1SY,"Not to be confused with the musical of the same name this is the 1995 Australian documentary of the same name that gave the show its title. It features exclusive archive footage of Peter Allen on stage, clips from a This is Your Life special plus Peter performing with his mother in law Judy Garland and ex-wife Liza Minnelli (as well as a member of the ""Allen Brothers"" with the non-related Chris ""Allen"" Bell). There are interviews with his friends and colleagues including Bernadette Peters, Harry Connick, Jr., Carole Bayer Sager (his most frequent collaborator) and Bette Midler (who does a hilarous version of Peter's autobiographical ""Tenterfield Saddler"" at the end, as taken from a tribute concert, during which she forgets the words because the lyrics fell out her hands!) Of course this has not been updated to include footage from the musical which opened on Australia with Todd McKenney in 1998 and on Broadway with Hugh Jackman in 2003, but there is a mention of it in a bonus interview with Ben Gannon who produced both the film and the musical.",1319328000,3,1060,4.829670329670329
2457001,5,B000CCD1SY,"I was a long-time fan of Peter Allen and had seen Hugh Jackman's wonderful performance in the Broadway show. Showed this DVD to friends who saw the show and they wished they had seen this DVD first, as they were not really that aware of the real Peter Allen's talents.",1289520000,8,268,4.38
2457002,4,B000CCD1SY,A good doco in memory of the Aussie Broadway star could more be contributed with 10-15 minutes of his live performing.,1262044800,2,118,4.666666666666667
2457003,5,B000CCD1SY,"With all the hype around Hugh Jackman's theatrical portrayal a few years back, I wondered if the REAL Peter Allen was as fabulous (YES!) as I had remembered. I tracked down this documentary to see if what I remembered might well be just a pretty memory.
This well-made documentary takes you back to the party hard, pre-AIDS hedonim that informed some of Peter's performing work, and foreshadows the how our culture was on the cusp of change.  Songs like CONTINENTAL AMERICAN and  I GO TO RIO were show stoppers in the gay/straight/bi clubs in San Fracisco back in the day.  Peter's energy, charisma and songwriting talent were mind-blowing then, and in retrospect, more than ever. So sad that he passed away so young, especially since the life-sustaining AIDS cocktail was just on the horizon.

This documentary takes you into a time  warp - If you saw the show and loved it or if you saw the show and didn't love it, or you don't know who Peter Allen was...get your hands on this DVD documentary and discover the real Peter Allen.",1189814400,33,1031,4.6740331491712706

8097224,2,B000CCD1SY,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be, rather amateurish actually.  I bought it mainly because of all the commentary regarding the Joan Rivers funeral and  the singing of the song ""Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage"" which I understand was wrenching and had everyone in tears and laughter at the same time.",1416441600,,314,4.589285714285714

Opened it and we watched it immediately--could not wait!  Great clips and terrific interview with the director.  Only downside is I'll have to buy my husband another present in November!",1410048000,,356,4.754098360655738

8097230,5,B000CCD1SY,"The reason I like this documentary so much is because it's packed with so much great and rare concert footage; as well as in-dept interviews with friends and collegues,such as Bernadette Peters, Carole Bayer Sager, and Ann-Margret. There are also some very insightful and entertaining clips from interviews with Allen himself. This program gives you a glimps of what an amazing showman and inspiring singer/songwriter Peter Allen was. An interesting bonus feature is an interview with the documentary's producer, Ben Gannon.
