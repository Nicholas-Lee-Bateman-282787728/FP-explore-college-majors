7980826,4,B000089QAM,Overall I gave it four stars for the main reason that left means left and right means right. In the video she tells you to go to your left and she goes to her right. The movements in this video are great. Beginners like me will have no problem doing the moves. Also she talks in a pleasant voice that will not lose your concentration when she's mediate.,1189555200,2,353,4.205882352941177
7980827,3,B000089QAM,"This is a beautifully set, good production DVD of a combo of tai chi, qi gong & yoga. She is alone & her form is of the movements is well done.
The dvd is taught with her narrating in a voice over. This is what bothered me about the dvd, many of the instructions were given a full 2-3 seconds before the video showed her doing it. While repeating some exercises, instead of her reminding you when to inhale/exhale (very important in these arts) she instead gives only general benefits of the exercises for those who don't exercise much, those who do would find this information rudimentary. This made following her harder though she DOES cue YOUR left & right.
The only yoga I could really see what some nice circular side bends & modified warrior 1. Most of this was easy tai chi & Qi gong movements.
This is not a dvd to break a sweat or really stretch out, this is very easy movements that senior citizens can & should do.
In some parts I did feel more calm, though I didn't feel an increase of energy like a solid Qi Gong video would give.
The other thing I didn't like was that if you take away the 20 min seated meditation & the 3 min intro, you're only left with 16 min of exercises maybe minus another minute of standing & breathing before beginning.

Overall, she does have a great presence & energy, she is not boring & she has beautiful form. Better repeated breathing instruction, more in sync instruction with video & more content would have made this a 5 star for those lookign for VERY EASY movements to relax by. This is not for anyone looking for decent stretching or anything that is considered a workout by anyone even if they almost never exercise unless they have disabilities or for, as I said senior citizens. I do hope she makes more videos of martial arts nature.
This DVD has helped me to see she is a great martial artist & great energy/form, better then 80% of the mainstream/popular kick boxing dvds out there. I ordered her G.I. Jabb videos because of it & the short clips  on her site at KatalinUSA com

You can see a clip on totalfitnessdvds com or youtube",1186272000,5,2088,4.390180878552972
