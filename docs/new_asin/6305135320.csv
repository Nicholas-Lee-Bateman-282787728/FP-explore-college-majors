7883677,1,6305135320,This movie felt like a propaganda campaign to convince us that Dodi and Diana were really going to get engaged.  I was very disappointed with this movie and would only recommend it to Dodi fans.,1393632000,,194,4.542857142857143
7883678,5,6305135320,I am glad that I purchased this dvd. This is truly a love story of Princess Diana and Dodi Al fyed. The dvd shows how they met for the first time to their enjoying their time together as a couple on the Al Fayed luxury boat. Very touching story. Beautifuly done!!!!,1370476800,,265,4.215686274509804

7883680,1,6305135320,"From one end to the other this video is obviously meant to make Mohamed Al Fayed look good. Almost all of the dialog is from people either in his family or his employ. Only Penny Thornton and Anthony Holden could even begin to be considered Diana's friends, no one from her family or close circle of friends is interviewed. The new and exclusive footage is almost entirely of those interviews, don't kid yourself into thinking you will get much of the Princess that you haven't already seen. This one is a real waste, not even very good if you're a Dodi fan. The program cover says from the makers of The People's Princess, that is a far better video even though Amazon doesn't have the DVD version.",993859200,6,699,4.511811023622047
7883681,5,6305135320,"I enjoyed this vidio because it had much information on, and pictures of, Dodi Fayed but for people looking for a vidio on Diana there are proberbly better ones. The vidio basically attepts to convince viewers that Dodi and  Diana were truely in love and planned to marry, which they may well have  been. The vidio has inteveiws with Dodi's family and friends and shows  pictures of them before and dureing the summer of '97. Overall the vidio is  not that intresting unless you enjoy photographs of Dodi (which I  personally do! ). I gave the vidio 5 stars for the information on Dodi but  unless you are really intrested there are proberbly better vidios to  purchase.",961459200,3,670,4.6752136752136755
