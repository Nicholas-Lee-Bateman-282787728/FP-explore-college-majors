733083,4,6303934501,"One of those accidental finds with 2 reviews that made me  curious.  Definitely fun for those of us who enjoy these older black and white movies. The plot is an improbably romantic intrigue with that twist of an assumed identity. The focus is on a group of British soldiers taken prisoner by the Germans in France (1940) and the man who joins their ranks. Worth watching for that glimpse into a bygone era when romance and war kept each other company. The acting is well done and the ending? Of course it has to have a happy ending!

25 June 2014: Pleased to read the reviews that have been added . . . this is a classic of the genre. Even those of us who are students of WWII can appreciate the romantic storyline. This is one you don't want to miss!",1382486400,3,751,4.274647887323944
733084,5,6303934501,"If could rate this movie a 10 I would. It's one of the best WW11 films I've ever seen. Great history, story, acting, and photography. Michael Redgrave is always a guarantee that you'll be seeing a wonderful film. Black & White WW11 stories aren't for everyone, but if you're fond of them as I am, you'll love this one.",1380499200,,318,4.406779661016949
733085,4,6303934501,The film has historic interest but the print is not in great shape.  It is one of these films that has its heart in the right place but is simplistic given the complexity of World War II.  I doubt that anyone will discover anything very new in the film. The performances are good.  Be sure to note the young Gordon Jackson of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS fame.,1374883200,2,351,4.369230769230769
733086,5,6303934501,"This is a gem of a film from post-WWII Britain (shot in an actual German POW camp). Several British POWs are taken to a camp in 1940, and the film shows the backgrounds of several of them - two men who are WWI veterans, a young musician, a man who lost his sight before being sent to the camp, and the main character, played by the incredible Michael Redgrave. Redgrave's character is not British, but Czech; after escaping from a concentration camp, he found the body of a British officer and stole his uniform and identity card. Having been sent to a POW camp, and having incurred the suspicion of the camp's commandant, he must continue to pretend to be this officer, writing elegant and increasingly romantic letters to the officer's estranged wife in England. The passage of time from 1940 to 1945 is beautifully shown. I want to see this one available on DVD!",1270857600,8,865,4.587096774193548
733087,5,6303934501,"The script is extremely poignant . A British officer killed in action and without knowing a letter from his wife goes to a Czech officer who decides to keep alive the dreams and hopes of that happy wife who still ignores is widow . From the ashes of the hell , from that dark concentration camp a little spark of love  will born since they exchange letters .

One superb film of Basil Dearden magnificently  played by Michael Redgrave .",1106179200,6,436,4.425
733172,5,6303934501,I bought this movie years ago as a VCR movie.  Then it got moldy and died on us.  I'm so glad it is now available again.  Thank you!!!  It's one of my favorite old movies.,1447286400,,171,3.8
733173,4,6303934501,A surprise. I have always enjoyed escape movies but this seemed at first to be a bit bland.  There are no great battles but if you enjoy good acting with a decent story line you may enjoy this.,1441065600,,193,4.078947368421052
733174,3,6303934501,The first 3/4 of the film were dreadfully boring but then it seemed to pick up a bit if you get my drift old boy.....,1430524800,,117,3.72
733175,5,6303934501,Good old time war flick. Fine acting and gripping story.,1415577600,,56,4.7

733178,2,6303934501,Really old movie that didn't hold our interest past the first 10 minutes.,1405296000,,73,4.6923076923076925
733179,4,6303934501,"Perhaps the most romantic war movie ever made, ""The Captive Heart"" is a study of British WWII prisoners held in a German camp. It alternates between scenes in camp and back home and gives an unconventional look at the war and its effects on both the prisoners and their families. The cast is first rate and the story is excellent.",1392768000,3,330,4.516666666666667
733180,4,6303934501,"Good WWII British prisoner of war tale, strong on characters and setting.  A Czech refugee takes on the identity of a dead British officer in June 1940 and survives years in a stalag, thanks to his fellow POWs and letters from the dead officer's wife.",1390435200,,251,4.5777777777777775
733181,5,6303934501,"Its a good movie, period. There are no cheats, with the truth is stranger than fiction thing going on. Watch it.",1386979200,,112,4.380952380952381

7855923,2,6303934501,"I find it highly unlikely she could have escaped a German roadblock the way she did. These German soldiers had to be able to run 5 kilometers to be able to put on the uniform, yet they stood there and let her go without firing a shot. For a story to be immersable it has to have better direction. This movie underscores the hardships the Hebrew had to endure during this period, much like the bridge on the river kwai did to the survivors of Japanese POW camps.",1468454400,,461,4.25

7855925,3,6303934501,"After reading the synopsis of this movie and reading great reviews, I was really disappointed with it. I love Michael Redgrave and nostalgic romantic dramas set against the backdrop of war, but this one wasn't nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe. If you want to see some great Michalel Redgrave films, watch ""Dead of Night,"" ""The Browning Version"" or ""The Lady Vanishes."" The transfer quality by Nostalgia Family, though, is top-rate.",1465516800,,446,4.96

7855927,5,6303934501,"These films from immediately after WWII, such as ""They were expendable,"" ""The cruel sea,"" and this one are in touch with what people went through.  Very little glamorizing, believable emotion.  The story line of life in a POW camp in WWII Germany seemed more like the real thing than even ""Stalag 17.""  It's a good evening's entertainment.",1462406400,2,339,4.912280701754386
7855928,4,6303934501,"It's not The Great Escape, but has some of the elements and one or two of the same actors (Gordon Jackson is great in this and TGE). Nice 1940s love story.",1461801600,,155,4.032258064516129
7855929,5,6303934501,"Can't tell if it is any good;I can't rate it, only watched a minute or so and will not see anymore of it.",1461456000,,105,3.608695652173913
