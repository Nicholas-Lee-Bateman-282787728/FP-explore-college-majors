8249611,3,B000WN77TM,"This movie is in Spanish. It depicts the history events that occurred in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. It shows the atrocities of war and the conditions of the country at the time of the Revolution. The ugliness of political greed of the Mexican generals and other military so called leaders at the time. The movie left out a lot of facts about the struggles of the Mexican people, and what led up to the revolt. It was okay, but not great.",1480204800,,448,4.475609756097561
