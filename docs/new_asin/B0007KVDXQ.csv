2216067,3,B0007KVDXQ,"I don't know when I've so eagerly anticipated a DVD as I did this one...finally, after over thirty years waiting for the hallowed ELP California Jam footage to come out, it's here.  Video quality exceeds my wildest expectations, considering the moguls at ABC in their Infinite Wisdom decided to wipe the original master tapes (??). I'm more than a bit disappointed in the audio being a little out of sync with the video  ( especially for a first-generation copy on then broadcast quality videotape! ), but this would be a minor consideration for many people.  You can actually see the etching on Carl Palmer's drums now!  This is Emerson, Lake and Palmer arguably at their finest...certainly the California Jam performance was a benchmark in their seventies heyday.  I'm, however, VERY disapppointed with the first DVD of this set.  The ""ELP in Pictures"" section is a hodge-podge of various performances, culminating with their 1997 version of Touch and Go.  Video quality is relatively poor throughout this segment. On more than a couple of numbers, they are lip-syncing to pre-recorded versions of the music  ( most notably ""Fanfare"" at Olympic Stadium ).  As awesome as the Cal Jam footage is, this DVD is not on par with the herculean Led Zeppelin extravaganza that came out over two years ago.  Buy this one for the California Jam section.  That's worth the price of admission alone!",1124323200,5,1388,4.939655172413793
2216068,3,B0007KVDXQ,"..... and severely lacking quality!

Nice collection of clips, but why on earth CUT THEM SHORT ???

Quality of the video also varies quite a bit. Some even seem like taken from a 2nd generation video (e.g. the clip from Japan).

Despite what the cover sais, it's NOT a 5.1 sound mix, but plain stereo.

Tracklisting on the back is wrong, fortunately the booklet has the correct listing.

Booklet is nice, but not very informative and some liner notes are plain silly.

On paper this looks like a great DVD set, but in reality, it's lacking quality on all fronts. The producers certainly didn't put any effort into releasing a high quality product.",1124064000,4,647,4.68141592920354

2216070,3,B0007KVDXQ,"This is mostly a collection of various footage culled from previously available sources. If you were a serious fan you might already have these media. For the price it is a good value for someone who was only familiar with the hits. Within the 2 disc set there are some duplications. 2 songs from the Cal Jam footage are also included under the ELP in Pictures heading on disc 1. The previously made feature documentary on disc 2 has segments which are also seen in greater length elsewhere in the set, but that is to be understood. Being that ELP had their heyday in the 1970's a younger fan might enjoy this better and seek out their albums on MP3 or CD.
Highlights: Each band member in a musical number from their previous acts. Greg Lake coming in 2nd at a celebrity auto race. 17- minutes of band practice with Keith helping Greg and Carl get their parts right. Bob Moog struggling through an interview about how his synthesizers impacted ELP and others. Concert and TV show footage including one with a large tiger. A cohesive documentary about the heyday of the band.
Despite some concerns about completeness of material, it is good to have this in a single set.",1363478400,3,1169,4.571428571428571
2216071,4,B0007KVDXQ,"A lot of good footage that any ELP fan would want in their collection, although much of it is just that, clips of good footage. Despite that, I enjoyed watching great old clips of such an iconic band. It's worth the purchase price.",1315612800,,231,4.395348837209302
2216072,4,B0007KVDXQ,"For someone like myself who never got to see this band perform live, mostly because I've never liked Emerson's synthesizer sound flooding and glazing over everything they did, but really enjoy listening to Lake's dynamic guitar and bass work, enchanting vocals, and his compositions of beautiful and masterful ballads, this DVD gives me the overview of how talented and dynamic they really were in their prime.  While I really enjoyed both disc 1 & 2, I wished there were more live performance footage on both discs.  Beyond The Beginning on Disc 2 is a good quick summary of this amazing band's history.  I also enjoy looking at their studio practice scenes as it shows each band member's personality when they worked together.  Overall, this band deserves a lot more recognition for what they have achieved in the world of Rock music and beyond, and this video is a good proof for that.",1252627200,3,888,4.822368421052632
2216073,5,B0007KVDXQ,"I remember the first time I listened to ELP. It was a rainy summer day when I was about 15. I went over to my friends house and he put on ""Pictures at an Exhibition"". To say the least it was like nothing I had heard before.  Within days I was at the record store to buy this record.  I was hooked.

ELP was a musician's band.  Through out the early 70's they won numerous magazine fan polls for best band and also for each of their individual instruments.

The performances in this collection are a bit chopped off in places for sure. I would still like to see a complete performance of Karn Evil 9 for example. But this is still the best collection on the market as far as I can tell.

The interviews with the various members, managers and producers are also very good, candid and honest.

If you like this band, then get this collection.",1243382400,6,839,4.238993710691824
2216074,5,B0007KVDXQ,"As a seasoned veteran still currently playing a Hammond B-3 organ in a local blues band, ELP is still, in my opinion, tops!! While they may have had internal personal problems, their music is first class!! This DVD shows some great footage throughout their career, as well as personal interviews with candid opinions from all. The rare California Jam footage alone is worth the price of the entire DVD. Check out Emerson's piano solo covering just about every style you can think of in the same solo!!
Anyone slinging complaints on this DVD is someone who can't be pleased!

2216079,4,B0007KVDXQ,"This a very good value double disc set (running time 250 mins).

OK a lot of the concert films are not up to modern standards, however as a historical document this will take some beating. It also demonstrates the fabulous musicianship of these 3 guys. The highlight for me is Keith Emerson's appearance on the Oscar Peterson show performing Honky Tonk Train Blues. But the (full length) promo film for Fanfare for the Common Man is also very good. There is quite an interesting documentary as well, and the 1974 California Jam session is on disc 2.",1173744000,2,549,4.65979381443299
2216080,3,B0007KVDXQ,"The clips that make up this DVD were done before much attention was payed to video recording. So, there are some less than perfect and sometimes just plain bad segments. For serious ELP fans, this is a must but unfortunately even the performances are a bit weak except for Greg Lake's vocals, which are for the most part, amazingly strong. It also leads me to believe that if Lake had more input into the direction of the band, they would have been even better. The classical adaptations that ELP were known for, were quite unique but often became tiresome with Emerson's self indulgent, lengthy solos.  The 2nd disc which includes a history of the band is quite informative. Unfortunately the guys come off as slightly bitter about how they were perceived and a bit pompous about their talents. Keith Emerson at one point states, ""maybe we were just too good"". I really am a fan of ELP but alot of their music has not aged well, with a few exceptions, it is mostly with nostalgia that I delve back into those recordings. This DVD solidifies the fact that they were a group of guys with an interesting idea but might have taken themselves a bit too seriously. Still, gotta love em. And the full version of Pirates is probably worth the price alone.",1167955200,8,1248,4.596412556053812
2216081,4,B0007KVDXQ,"nice compilation of an underdocumented band

I never got to see any of the erly concerts so this was a real treat for me",1158278400,2,120,4.0
2216082,4,B0007KVDXQ,"I purchased my vinyl copy of Tarkus at the time of it's original release in 1971. Super Groups were a current flavour, and musicians from the sixties pop era who could play better than others, and who wanted to take certain music forms and blend them further, formed new partnerships and sought new progressions. Emerson Lake and Palmer established their own direction with complex virtuousic keyboard forays, supported by equally complex drum and guitar runs. Elements of classical and baroque structures were (fairly) seamlessly incorporated.

It never occurred to me that there was a dynamic tension at work between the band members then, or that the mix of melodic pop and driving jazz-aligned tracks was anything more than an exercise in contrast, clever album production of the period.

The DVD contains interviews with the three band members, who, with the passage of time, discuss those tensions in a relatively objective fashion, illustrating the various directions they sought to take with video sequences. Their commentary is fleshed out with interview comments from the managers and promoters around them. There is a sequence of music videos from their career path right through the seventies until they eventually fracture as a group entity.

If you seek to make sense of your era of musical history, this sort of material offers much assistance. Video quality is naturally a product of the era, but if you are interested in setting your music heroes in their historical context, releases like this are very valuable",1156636800,10,1529,5.157258064516129
2216083,5,B0007KVDXQ,"ELP was the first progressive band that caught my interest back in 1973, and it was initially for the music of Greg Lake that I was hooked. For maybe two decades I never again listened to ELP, or indeed any of the bands that I got into in the mid-Seventies. I followed the trends of the day, punk, new wave and finally bland pop, through the Eighties, until the Nineties came and I found music so goddamn awful that I made a conscious decision to retrace my steps and rediscover the music of my youth.

In the meantime a lot of the early bands I'd come to believe were immature - simply because I'd been a kid at the time and they must have been immature for me to have liked them. So I had to discover them all over again. The only exceptions to this were the real classic bands - the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull. I got a compilation of ELP and was shocked to discover that apart from the Greg Lake ballads I really didn't know the music at all. Worse yet, my family couldn't stand the discordant Emerson instrumentals and I had to often switch it off. But I became hooked and now own just about everything by ELP.

From there I also expanded into other progressive bands, firstly King Crimson, Yes, Genesis - but to me ELP represents the very heart of what progressive music is all about. It is the best.

I was a bit apprehensive about this DVD considering some of the negative reviews, but for once a DVD exceeded my expectations. I normally spend more time reading the negative reviews, as glowing positive tributes are really not to be trusted. I look for balance and objectivety.

A notable highlight for me was Carl Palmer. I normally don't pay much heed to drummers, but Carl (along with Keith Moon) are the only drummers I find noticeable. His drumming is quite unbelievable. I expected virtuosity from Emerson and an excellent voice from Lake, but I'd had no expectations of Palmer. He is amazing.

The most important feature of ELP is the one I haven't yet mentioned, and that is the quality of their compositions. I have long believed that the secret to success of many bands is the intensity of competition between composers, such as Lennon and McCartney, and Lake and Emerson. Although I now prefer the Emerson compositions, I still believe ELP would be nothing without the balance between the Lake and Emerson songs. Endless, frenetic, discordant Emerson compositions might just be unlistenable, but interspersed with pretty Lake compositions, and it's a masterpiece.",1154476800,9,2521,4.643497757847534
2216084,5,B0007KVDXQ,"The DVD is more than what I expected. Full concert footage of amazing quality. I was fortunate enough to see ELP 4 times in my life. Thinking all I had was the memories of their performances, now I can see how truly amazing they were with this excellent footage let alone show my kids why music today is a farce. ELP's music intensity is captured in this fine DVD. Also the commentary about the breakup of the band was quite in depth. My hat is off to Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer for leaning towards the instrumental commitment of the band. As most true ELP fans will tell you, Lucky Man was not why ELP was famous, but Tarkus, Hoe Down, Fanfare for the Common Man, etc as well as the brilliant playing that showcased ELP' s vast talent.

This is a must buy for ELP fans as well as up and coming musicians that may be inspired for new standards in music.",1153267200,6,856,4.251533742331288
2216085,5,B0007KVDXQ,"As a rabid Emerson, Lake, and Palmer fan, I was looking forward to this documentary, and, luckily, for the most part, it was very good. The music is fantastic, and the ""Beyond the Beginning"" documentary is very good. The clips are interesting (even though the music of some of them are set to studio recordings, as, I assume, the original audio was lost).  And there are some technical glitches here and there (which have been documented by other reviewers), but compared to previous ELP DVD releases, they are relatively minor.  When I first saw Lake, I thought it was an overweight roadie.  He looks like he hasn't left his flat in years. Emerson looked ragged as well, but looked more irritated than anything. Palmer, on the other hand, was lucid and looked very well for his age.  I never really knew about the creative tension between Emerson and Lake before.  It was the reason for the group's many breakups.  Yet, when Emerson or Lake was in a seperate band (like Emerson and Palmer's horrible 3), it just wasn't the same.  Personality conflicts aside, I wish bands nowadays would have the ambition that these 3 gentlemen did. They were always looking for new sounds, as opposed to many (but not all) bands nowadays, who seem only interested in the celebrity aspects of the business. While ELP probably indulged themselves like all rock stars do, they also had an intensity in their music that is sorely missing today. Even on lesser albums like Love Beach, they had a professionalism that makes it listenable (the album is not as bad as some would suggest).  I always get annoyed at critics who rag (even to this day) about how ELP was a terrible band, just driven by ego and nothing else.  Then there's the cliched line that they (and all of progressive rock) was pretentious.  Emerson says in this documentary that the reason that many people disliked (and resented) them was because they were too good.  This comment may sound arrogant, but it isn't.  Emerson says it rather nonchalantly, not in an arrogant and smug way.  Emerson is the best damn keyboardist rock has ever seen, and Palmer is the most underrated drummer ever.  Lake was never given credit for his musical dexterity and songwriting capabilities.  ELP's technical proficency is unbelievable and truly amazing.  No matter how many times I hear them, I still marvel at them.  I do love other progressive bands, like Yes and King Crimson, but ELP still remains my favorite.  I would love to hear some band today to be as ambitious as these guys can.  They (and the other progressive rock bands) were not pretentious, they were simply ambitious.",1149292800,24,2618,4.777777777777778
2216086,4,B0007KVDXQ,"Yet another Christmas gift from my daughter that I'll always treasure (isn't it great having COOL kids?) Yes, some of the clips are incomplete and a little out- of - focus, but this is the only chance I've had to see some of these performances of one of my favorite bands. Having grown- up in a very small town in northern Michigan, we had very little opportunity to see larger acts (if any at all) so this is a real treat. I did see some of the footage from the Califonia Jam performances, but that was eons ago. ELP plays superlatively on these offerings, which pretty much spans their most successful years. It is a welcome addition to my collection and I watch it quite frequently. Wish there was more from King Crimson, but it's nice to catch a small glimpse! I enjoy these films because they take me back to a simpler (and cooler) time, so to me the DVD is worth it for the nolstalgic value alone. PLUS... getting to see these consummate musicians performing some of their greatest hits (Karn Evil 9, Lucky Man, Tarkus, Hoedown, etc.) is very enjoyable.

2216088,5,B0007KVDXQ,"I just got this today. Watched the entire 200+ Minutes. WOW! I have to say that this is the ELP I have been waiting for. I was a ""Lucky Man"" in the 70's and attended at least 15 ELP Shows in Los Angeles. I saw JOURNEY Open up for ELP in 1974 at the Long Beach Arena. It was the Brain Salad Surgery Tour. I consider Emerson Lake And Palmer one of the Great Super-groups of the 20th Century. I watched the California Jam on a ABC show called IN CONCERT. Someone said it was Don Kirshner. No it was not. The show aired Friday Nights at 11:30pm on ABC every week. It was great. For all these years I have searched for that ELP performance. Now, I have it. Someone also complained that they should of fixed the Transfer from Video to Digital. I don't agree. This is the way it was shown and this is the way it should be viewed. It is awesome. Too bad there is not an entire version of TARKUS. I am going to see CARL PALMER perform here in Los Angeles at the Roxy Theater. That is a Small Club Setting. He will do Tarkus. Seeing and hearing all this great ELP gave me chills. I was there in the day when ELP sold out every venue they performed in. Of course at that time tickets were about 7 bucks or so. The Crimson clip does not show Robert Fripp. I guess that may have been shot on 8MM Film. For Progressive Rock Fans and ELP Aficionados, this is the Ultimate collection of one of the Great Rock Trios EVER! Don't hesitate to purchase this for your collection. I have no complaints. It seems great care was taken to put this collection together. I admire that in any artist. Welcome Back my friends to the SHOW that Never ends.",1144886400,11,1624,4.1424050632911396
2216089,4,B0007KVDXQ,"As a hardcore ELP fan with most of the available bootleg videos, I was curious as to what the band's first ""real"" official DVD documentary would look like.  In short, this is an excellent two-disc anthology that collects nearly all of the known video footage of the group's career minus those shows already out on DVD (the 1970 ""Pictures At An Exhibition"" film, the Montreal '77 show and the '92 Royal Albert Hall performance, although good excerpts from the latter two do make an appearance here).

The spotlighted reviewer who complains about most of the songs being edited must be on crack; as someone who owns most of this footage on bootleg video, I can say for a fact that these tracks appear fully uncut and in outstanding audio/visual condition.  The only tracks which are cut (Rondo/Pictures from the IOW festival, Rondo from Brussels) were cut on the original source films and not edited for the DVD; the same goes for some of the California Jam footage (and despite what some hopeful reviewers out there may believe, it's probably safe to say that the ABC TV footage is the *only* existing footage of that show, and in any case it appears here in sound and visual quality far, far surpassing any bootleg, and also presented in the *original* performance order, not the butchered order ABC broadcast it in).  As for ""Take A Pebble"", ""Watching Over You"", ""I Believe In Father Christmas"" and ""Karn Evil 9: 3rd Impression"", these all appear complete, uncut, perfectly in synch and again in outstanding quality...I wonder just what copy some people here saw!

The only disappointment, really, is the footage of ""Eruption"" from the '72 Tokyo show: yes, the bootleg is better and contains a complete performance of the song, although the Japanese camerawork is so shoddy to begin with that perhaps the DVD producers felt it unworthy to include all 25 minutes of the piece.

The one-hour documentary ""Beyond The Beginning"" is better than the early 90s documentary ""Welcome Back My Friends""; the band is more candid and revealing in the interviews, and the history is more comprehensive and not so focused on the 90s reunion tours.  The segments with Bob Moog, the '73 rehearsal footage and the piece on the album covers are all revealing and completes a very welcome set.  If the ELP fan gets this along with ""Pictures At An Exhibition"" (although it's too bad that *that* DVD is edited to include only the title track), ""Montreal '77"" (which comes with the 30 minute '73 Manticore documentary to boot, although the only complete concert performance on it is ""Hoedown"" from Milan which is indeed included on disc one here) and ""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"", they will have pretty much all of ELP that's worthy on video with only a few exceptions like the Tokyo footage and perhaps the ""Knife Edge"" from Beat Club.

In short, if you are an ELP fan, get it and just be thankful that all of this priceless, outstanding performance footage is now officially available in great audiovisual quality, along with a fine documentary.  And let's not forget the almost never-before seen King Crimson Hyde Park footage in the extras...",1144627200,7,3127,4.82803738317757
2216090,5,B0007KVDXQ,"ELP brings back good memories to me. I saw them in 1977 in the OLYMPIC STADIUM in MONTREAL.To this day,i wondered why they did not blown up the stadium with their special effects. We are still stuck with that unstable toilet bowl. The critics never really liked ELP,you just have to look at the old ROLLING STONE album guide to find the words pretentious,synthesized overkill and indulgence under their names. I never watched any old bootleg stuff,so i am very satisfied with this 2 dvd set. The documentary is excellent and really tells us why the group could not last forever. One of the reasons for putting out this stuff on the market,is that the new generation now know that KEITH EMERSON is not only the guy who could make his piano spin. Among the concert footage highlights for me are the piano improvisations by KEITH on disc 2 and the FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MAN with the guys wearing their wintercoats. Even if the images and the sounds are not perfect,you should enjoy BEYOND THE BEGINNING,especially if you were a fan in the seventies. My only real regrets are that we don't have a complete TARKUS footage and we don't see GREG singing FROM THE BEGINNING and JERUSALEM.Let's not forget that ELP made us aware that classical music could mix with pop.

2216093,3,B0007KVDXQ,"This video collection has some disappointments. It's a makeshift collection put together for the sake of selling.

First of all, those Tarkus segments from the Japan concert are VERY BAD. They are makeshift videos and not the original. There is a full version of Tarkus from that concert - complete from Eruption till Aquatarkus - that, whoever put together this DVD together, should have taken as source. Tarkus is such a fantastic piece from ELP and there is no proper video of it from being performed between 1972-74. What a shame indeed.

The Japan 72 bootleg video shows Eruption with more closeups on Lake and Palmer. Unfortunately again, Emerson is very hard to see, but at least he can be seen playing one hand on the Hammond C-3, and the other one on the Hammond L-100. Nothing of this appears on the DVD.

Toccata is another disappointment. Now I do not know if there is a full video of this fantastic piece. I was hoping that this DVD would have it. The 2 segments containing only Palmer's solo are very dull.

The only rescuable item is the California Jam, as they got a much better source with more clarity. But, again, it was butchered. This original show was televised as part of one of those ""Don Kirschner Rock Concert"" presentations. The DVD shows the ELP sequences cut off without the introductions. It could have been more interesting if they'd just put the entire tv show as it originally was, a true time machine and an example to current young viewers of the magnitude of 70's tv rock concert shows.

I am positively sure that the band has, in their personal vaults, fantastic full videos of their performances. Why they don't release them? Is there any video from the full Brain Salad Surgery Manticore tour? The band released a series of audio bootlegs which I believe it was a very wise move; they opened their audio vaults to delight of all ELP fans to posterity.  I can't believe that there is no video whatsoever from the whole BSS tour; there must be a full Toccata video somewhere... I must keep looking, because it's worth it...",1133568000,7,2060,4.645604395604396
2216094,4,B0007KVDXQ,"This is the story of most rock bands:  out of the gates with a burst of creativity, maybe a false step or two, a couple classic albums, followed by...formulaic repetition, the inevitable break-up, and the inevitable unnecessary and embarrassing reunions.

1970: Beat Club--Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  One mercurial and extravagantly talented keyboardist, one young and extremely fleet and precise drummer, one svelte-voiced, pretty-boy bass player with a keen understanding of his strengths and limitations.  They interact beautifully, improvising, complimenting each other in a jazzy format.

1974: California Jam--The venue has changed to stadium rock, and spectacle and showmanship are pushing the music into the realm of parody.  The keyboard player still has his chops.  He spins around in the air with a grand piano.  This is a bit like watching ""The Man Who Skied Down Everest""... The bass player still looks good, cockily chewing gum as he sings, like his hero John Lennon.  The drummer looks a bit lost as his kit nearly obscures him.

1997: Royal Albert Hall--Well into his forties (maybe his fifties?..), the keyboard player winces as he plays.  Cramp?  Carpal tunnel?  He runs into the audience brandishing a Robert Moog toy like a phallus. Time has not been kind to the bass player, who now looks (and sounds) like William Shatner's paunchy Captain Kirk in search of the Enterprise.

Bonuses:  Footage of the band in rehearsal, 1973, and racing cars in England (same year).  These segments reveal that ELP was a band that was professional, and surprisingly down to earth. No apparent huge egos or star trips, just young men having a great time with their lives.

The big mistake was going into the huge productions:  ""Brain Salad Surgery"" and afterwards.  This band should have scaled back on technology and relied on the creativity they showed when they began, in the first clip.

Interesting, nonetheless.

P.S.  ELP fanatics--please take this review with a grain of salt, and a sense of humor.",1133568000,5,2009,5.116923076923077
2216095,5,B0007KVDXQ,"ELP fans, this is what you've been waiting for!

Over 4 hours of material, from fascinating early TV spots, some magnificent live performances, candid off-the-cuff material and the definitive Chris Langham documentary about this erstwhile mega-group.

Unlike earlier DVDs, this contains full live versions of some of their best material, with no irritating voiceover.

Highlights for me are (disk 1) the absolutely blistering performance of Hoedown, the rocking powerhouse of Tank, the definitive Karn Evil 9 and Tarkus, and the full extended version of Fanfare.  Disk 2 contains some 45 minutes of the legendary California Jam festival performance, including Greg's famous solo set, two thirds of Karn Evil 9 and the utterly amazing spinning grand piano routine.

So many extras really spoil the viewer. Great to see a very young and bemasked Carl playing on Arthur Brown's ""Fire"", as well as the Nice's classic ""America"" and Greg doing what he does best on Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid Man.  The disk 2  documentary is fascinating - all 3 guys (along with managers, promoters etc) telling it as it was and the true reasons for the band's fall from grace become apparent.

Only slight negative points are the often grainy film quality of early clips and definitely NOT surround-sound audio quality, despite claims on the back of the box (OK, so on some tracks there appears to be /something/ coming out of the 5.1 speakers, but it just sounds like the same channel split 5 ways). Also the docu does not cover the final album - In the Hot Seat, which is perhaps understandable and no great loss to be honest. But, what the hell, this is almost up there with Led Zep's Red Rock as one of the greatest music DVDs of all time and is certainly meritous of its 5 stars!

Having seen the Carl Palmer band a couple of times now, I'm still waiting for them to issue a DVD. How about it guys?",1133136000,3,1886,4.7784615384615385
2216096,5,B0007KVDXQ,"Like all of you, I've been waiting forever and a day for this stuff to come out.  I got my second copy of it (because my first one wouldn't play) and it took a while, but I'm finally able to view.  I read some stuff in a review that during California Jam, the DVD would revert back to the menu and such.  My problems were that once the DVD loaded, I was not able to highlight any choices on the menu.  It would not turn BOLD RED as it should.  This happened on both of them.  I have a fairly high end DVD player, and really was looking forward to seeing and hearing this in the quality I'm accustomed to.  NONE of my other hundreds of music DVD have this problem.  I don't know what the deal is, but this needs to be addressed.  I ended up hooking my kid's PS2 to my system, buying 50 bucks worth of decent cable so I could try to make it as good as possible.  Still sounds a little ragged---I'm really disappointed with that.  I'm curious as to anyone else having this problem.  Other than the DVD itself being unplayable, the material is wonderful.  I strongly recommend purchase even for the casual ELP fan.  Sometimes the visual just does it to send you over the edge.",1132185600,4,1172,4.197309417040358
2216097,5,B0007KVDXQ,"As an Emerson Lake and Palmer fan I have to say that most ELP fans annoy me. Much like most of them are annoyed by the infamous psychedelic special effects in the Pictures movie. It seems to me that what they are really bothered by is not being able to see Keith's hands while he plays. As if, ""they"" could one day play as well as he does, if ONLY they could see what he does! Get a life guys... You'll NEVER be able to play like Keith Emerson!

Now back to the DVD. I like this DVD. No, you don't get a full concert like with the Picture at an Exhibition movie, but it has a lot of great stuff. And of course no psychedelic special effects. Which, by the way, do not bother me.

Just for the sheer volume of material any seious ELP fan should have this. Of course, if you possess ALL of the old bootleg tapes and laser discs, then I'm sure this wouldnt be worth your while. I unfortunately do not have the bootleg material. If ELP puts something out, I buy it, legitimatley. If you are a true ELP fan, don't you think ELP should be the ones you are buying from? Oh well, most ELP fans are @@#$holes. I guess I am too, but whatever.

So if your are not a lawbreaker and want to see some classic ELP footage from the early 70's and more, then get this. I mean cripes it has the California Jam! You get to see the robot from Karn Evil 9! What more do you want? I've been wating my whole life to see it. SO I am not complaining.

By the way, if you guys had any respect for ELP you would have given this movie a 5 STAR RATING! Instead of a 4 or 3.

To Keith, Greg and Carl, thanks guys, you were gods. And you are the greatest band of all time.

2216098,3,B0007KVDXQ,"You would think that record companies would try and get it right when releasing archival footage of classic artists, but again, someone has botched what would be an excellent release and not bothered to go back and ""fix"" it. Overall, the footage on here is great to have as there isn't much available from ELP from this time period, but the highlight of the set would be the Cal Jam performance and what do we get? A performance that has been chopped into pieces with no continuous flow from song to song which is especially annoying when one song goes into another i.e. ""Still You Turn Me On"" into ""Lucky Man"". What happens is if you are watching the footage in it's entirety beginning with the Cal Jam footage, you will find at the end of each song, the DVD will pause and then jump back to the main menu (at least on both of my players it does---I have heard that on some it just pauses for a few seconds and then continues to the next song). For the record, the manufacturer blames this on ""the authoring software used to create the disc"". Well, duh! It doesn't matter where the fault lies---why not fix it if you know it's a problem? Instead, the fans get some classic footage that could have been better done. Why do something halfway when you could have went back and done it correctly? I'm sure that will be blamed on the ""cost of production"". Anyway, 3 stars for the footage and I would have given it higher if not for this annoying flaw. After all, it is a concert and meant to be viewed as a continuous performance.",1129766400,10,1526,4.376760563380282
2216099,3,B0007KVDXQ,"When I heard the news that this DVD was going to be released, I thought that my old ELP VHS tapes collection will rest in peace in a box down in my basement.  I was wrong.

Bootleggers around the world must be very happy since their material still worth the money they ask for.

This DVD contains great material, but sometimes it is uncomplete, edited, and/or out of synchronization.  Fans of the band has had some of this videos for a long time.  Beyond the Beginning Documentary is worth to be seen.  Now let's go for more serious review:

1. TAKE A PEBBLE (1970, THE BEAT CLUB TV SHOW)

Uncomplete! Beat Club session.  They should have included at least The Knife Edge from  the same sessions.  This was available on ""The Best Of Beat Club DVD  - 1973 (sic)"" (formerly on japanese Laserdisc, laterly on PAL DVD).

2. KNIFE EDGE (1971, BRUSSELS CONCERT)

This was already available on ELP ""Masters from the Vaults"" DVD.  Please note this track is taken from two different shows, same venue.

3. RONDO / PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION (1970, FROM ISLE OF WIGHT)

This is the infamous ""portion"" of ELP included on Murray Lerner film ""Message to Love"" about the Isle of Wight Festival.  Look for the european or japanese release of this DVD to see the full performance of Rondo.  Maybe it's time to ask Murray Lerner for the complete ELP IOW festival performance (he's been releasing parts of his material: The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Jethro Tull)

4. RONDO (1971, BRUSSELS CONCERT)

This was already available on ELP ""Masters from the Vaults"" DVD

5. TARKUS - ERUPTION (1972, TOKYO CONCERT)

This is an abdridge third and at sometimes fourth generation video.

6. HOEDOWN (1973, MILAN CONCERT)

Great! maybe at a different speed (maybe due to transfer from video to digital) than the actual recording but a must have. I have only seen photos from this concert in italian magazine Ciao 2001.

7. TANK (1973, MILAN CONCERT)

Mmmmh! maybe this is Tank in disguise, a better name should have been ""Drum Solo""

8. LUCKY MAN (1974, CALIFORNIA JAM): A bit out of synch. but great.  Which bubble gum brand sponsored this concert?

9. KARN EVIL 9, 3RD IMPRESSION (1974, CALIFORNIA JAM)

Edited, uncomplete and cut!

10. TOCCATA (1974, AQUARIUS TV SHOW)

Great! An unwanted fade at the end but a must have.

11. I BELIEVE IN FATHER CHRISTMAS (1975, PROMO)

Uncomplete!

12. HONKY TONK TRAIN BLUES (1976, OSCAR PETERSON PIANO PARTY)

Er.. well I have never enjoyed much those Scott Joplin piano style improvisation that Keith used to play.  Please note that Roy Babbington (ex Soft Machine) is on acoustic bass.

13. FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MAN (1977, PROMO VIDEO)

Great! An unwanted fade at the end but a must have.

14. PIRATES (1977, MONTREAL CONCERT)

Great moment and great effort with orchestra and the famous Palmer spinning drums kit. Previously available on VHS Live in Montreal

15. TIGER IN THE SPOTLIGHT (1977, POP ROCK TV SHOW)

Great!  ELP doing a play back for this number.

16. WATCHING OVER YOU (1978, MEMPHIS CONCERT)

Out of synch and cut.  Poor image quality.

17. TARKUS (1992, ROYAL ALBERT HALL CONCERT):

The band  doesn't play anymore the full version of this great number.  Fine performance.

18. TOUCH AND GO (1997, BUDAPEST CONCERT)

New song, for this new incarnation of ELP that goes pretty well.

Promo Videos:

1. AMERICA (THE NICE) - 1968 BEAT CLUB TV SHOW

Beautiful.  They should have included The Nice live performance of Tim Hardin's ""Hang on to a Dream"" from the same TV show.  This was available on ""The Best Of Beat Club DVD  - 1968"" DVD - PAL format.

2. FIRE (THE CRAZY WORLD OF A. BROWN) - 1968 BEAT CLUB TV SHOW

Great!

3. 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN (KING CRIMSON) - 1969 HYDE PARK

I have never seen this one before, it's just a segment but it's great.

Bonus Footage:

1. ELP IN REHEARSAL 1973

Great! A must have. Keith leading the band from the basement.

2. ""THE STORY OF THE ALBUM COVERS"" DOCUMENTARY

Uncomplete. No info. on the first album cover, mentioning the original fold out cover of the early releases with a band photo inside. No info. on ""Welcome Back..."" triple fold out cover.

3. ELP AT BRANDS HATCH 1973

Useless!

4. INTERVIEW WITH BOB MOOG

It will always be a pleasure to listen to the master himself speaking (great stories!), but he is not a funny guy, he just created and built the famous MOOG synthesizers including the world acclaimed Mini MOOG.

DISC 2

CALIFORNIA JAM 1974, 44-MINUTE PERFORMANCE:

I have mixed feelings with release.  First I'm happy to see an official release but I was waiting for a more PROFESSIONAL work not only a basic transfer from the original videos.

This is not the entire concert, it's not in the right order, in various segment is out of synchronization (voice - Sound).  Even more, the last segment is taken from a different source (piano spinning and Great Gates of Kiev).  Compare this one with top class Deep Purple C. Jam 74 Laserdisc and/or DVD, to understand what I'm talking about.",1128988800,156,4971,4.675174013921113
2216100,4,B0007KVDXQ,"As a video collector I already own much of what's here, though it's nice to have some of it on DVD. Serious fans will want to track down the complete Belgian '71 program, for instance, though there's enough rare material offered to keep even serious fans' attention throughout. What surprised me, however, was the honesty with which the band members discuss the less than positive aspects of their history and their relationships with one another. Overall this set offers a nice balance of archival live footage plus a comprehensive biographical overview told from both the band's point of view as well as by those close to them at the time.",1128729600,7,641,4.836363636363636
2216101,1,B0007KVDXQ,"Recently I had purchased ELP ""Masters from the Vaults"" and I was disapointed because of the major out of sync pieces. So finally I was hoping in bying this DVD it will a nice purchase,A CLASSIC !! What a shame. Another time, a lot of pieces are out of sync and of course my favorites one like Tarkus,Lucky Man,Still you turn me on,etc etc...I cannot beleive there is no quality control before releasing a DVD of a great band like this.",1128211200,9,435,4.382716049382716
2216102,3,B0007KVDXQ,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD mostly because it does to much but offers too little. Like the ""Picture at an Exhibition"" DVD, this DVD offers too many excerpts and clips that are poorly edited.  (This has been covered in the other reviews.) The Pictures at an Exhibiltion DVD was an excerpt from a film called Rock and Roll Your Eyes.  The film included really nice early footage of ELP in c1970 with renditions of The Barbarian, Take a Pebble and Knife's Edge.  These do not appear on the DVD. Like this DVD, Beyond the Beginning offers too many snipets without a full appreciation of the concert effect.  This is most notable in the Cal Jam footage, which is the selling point of the DVD.  This was a made for tv concert that was aired in 1974.  As is exemplified from the clips in the documentary that is included in the package, the footage was actually better than we see here. The cut of a verse in Karn Evil #9 Part II, shortly after the drum solo is annoying.  Also, one of the tunes from the concert is on Disc one while the concert is on disc two.  Probably the biggest dissappointment is that the footage of Toccatta, one of the band's highlights, is excerpted from the drum solo.  There are some nice documented moments, Tiger in the Spotlight, the wonderful Fanfare video at Montreal Stadium, here though the video is out of sync with the music, and the video of Palmer and Emerson performing with Oscar Peterson.  We also get television footage of Carl Palmer's drum set.  But after the novelty of seeing these documents grows thin, there is not enough good concert footage to actually be an enjoyable DVD to just sit back and watch.",1128124800,8,1653,4.5134228187919465
2216103,5,B0007KVDXQ,"If you are a true ELP fan, the 1974 Cal Jam footage contained in this DVD is exactly what you have been wishing and hoping for...reasonably produced footage of ELP at their peak on their Brain Salad Surgery World Tour.

I was lucky enough to see this tour twice in Cincinatti and St. Louis, and although this footage isn't perfect or as good as being there was, it has plenty of thrills and shocks.  Emerson's technique during the piano solo and especially the Hammond work on Karn Evil 9 3rd Impression is simply amazing.

Do yourself a favor and get this DVD right now and also the ELP Masters From The Vaults which has some very entertaining moments for serious ELP fans.

Do yourself another favor and skip the sad ELP At Montreux 1997 DVD. Emerson's marvelous technique displayed on the Cal Jam footage contained here is nowhere to be found in the 1997 Montreux DVD.  He's shockingly sloppy and constantly rushing the phrasing, Greg's voice has not aged well, and Carl appears to be miserable, having his hands full just whacking out the basic tempo trying his best to keep it all together.  I wish it weren't true, but after seeing the Cal Jam footage in Beyond The Beginning, I can never watch the Montreux DVD again.",1127865600,5,1224,4.591743119266055
2216104,5,B0007KVDXQ,"This is a keeper, for sure... (unlike 'Masters from the Vaults'). This DVD has a bunch of stuff ELP fans are gonna love... including 'The California Jam' (yeah... the flying piano is in there, too). There is some of the producers-on-acid stuff in the old footage... and a little 'poor camera work'... but for the era, the worst of it you can swallow ok. The sound is pretty good... better than expected.

There is also an interview with Bob Moog, which is also good, esp. since he has since passed (RIP, Bob). I don't recall at this moment if the error I'm about to mention is on this DVD, or on The Moog Movie (I watched both back to back)... but- at one point, Bob Moog is talking about the first time he heard Keith's famous 'Lucky Man' lead part... and he says something like 'no one had ever heard that sound before... the square-wave & glide thing'. The problem is... Keith borrowed that sound and the glide from the track ""The Minotaur"" by Dick Hyman. None the less, hearing Bob talk about Keith's (and Carl's) involvement with Moog is very interesting.

You'll have many questions answered, and you'll have a much better feel for what it must have been like for the band from the beginning thru the 90's. There is a section where they are in studio rehersal that is very interesting. It's too bad that the scene where they are playing 'Fanfare for the Common Man', it is pretty obvious that they were syncing to the track, rather than an actual performance.... (probably wasn't their idea, either).

Bottom line on this DVD... it's not easy to make me happy... esp. with this type of DVD... and I say, 'BUY IT!!!'. If you're and ELP and/or Moog fan, you be glad you did.",1127433600,6,1678,4.495081967213115

There is talk of a Pictures From...concert out there without fancy camera work that distracts from the trio's playing, and with songs like The Barbarian and Take A Pebble included.  Why was this not included in this set?  The second disc of this set isn't all that great.  I believe most of us are buying it for the Cal Jam footage. A must for diehards!",1127433600,2,446,4.273809523809524
2216106,5,B0007KVDXQ,"I'm a musician, and music fan in general.  I love progressive rock (ELP, Yes, early Genesis -- the usual suspects) as well as many other types of rock, other genres, etc.  This is probably my 5th ELP DVD, and it finally gives me what I've been waiting for -- the band in its magnificent early-to-mid 70's heyday.  Never mind the grainy video quality and jumpy edits of some of the footage -- who cares?  The point here is not to show off your plasma TV or surround system -- the point is to witness a historical artifact of sorts, a window back in time to an incredible (and sadly lost) era of true musicianship and vision in the world of popular music.  It was a time when musicians (and yes, they were virtuoso musicians then, with no shame attached to the title) could experiment and create astonishingly fresh and innovative music, to a public that was not brainwashed by media empires, and who eagerly accepted the works of these gifted masters.  It wasn't ""uncool"" to be a recognized craftsman with your instrument (or voice).  It wasn't ""required"" to conform to the mass media's idea of ""what pop should sound like"".  It wasn't necessary to stick to the same production techniques, the same in-your-face compression on every band's vocals, the same drum loops and sampled blasts of noise used over and over (loops and samples didn't exist; there were actual humans who actually played their instruments).

I won't attempt to repeat what has already been said about this DVD -- but one of the things that most impressed me was the Bonus Footage on Disc 1, called ""ELP rehearsing in 1973"" (!).  It actually showed the band in the studio, painstakingly going over an intricate passage from Brain Salad Surgery's ""Karn Evil 9, 2nd Impression.  From our vantage point of the present, one tends to look back upon works like these as ""immortal; set in stone; eternal"".  But the reality was that they were written, and orchestrated, and arranged, by actual guys in their early 20's, joking around in a studio, and coming up - note by note - with pieces of music that would be destined (unbeknown to them at the time) to become classic and, yes, immortal.  It would be like ""seeing"" a young Mozart sitting in his music room, composing one his great works, one note at a time, and seeing just how ""human"" he really was -- how young, how silly, how brilliant.  That's what this was like -- it injected a dimension of humanity and reality into a piece of music that I tend to think of as ""larger than life"".

It's also funny how we tend to think of our heroes as ""aging as we do"", and thus always being our contemporaries.  Of course, in the chronological sense, we all do age on the same timeline.  But the Keith Emerson that composed Tarkus was a young, brash  guy in his mid-20's.  The Greg Lake that penned ""Still...You Turn me On"" was - to me, now 46, just a kid.  It's strange that a 46-year old's ""heroes"" are all ""kids""...!

Buy this DVD.  Don't get it for the immaculate picture or the razor-sharp editing -- they aren't there.  Instead, look at it as a window into the musical past -- a past of stupendous freedom and creativity that, with the onset of an interconnected, Internet-based, individuality-smothering society, may never be again.",1127260800,32,3246,4.60695652173913

2216108,4,B0007KVDXQ,"""Welcome Back My Friends!""  We ELP fans get another chance to talk about the greatest rock band IN THE WORLD!!!

There are many ELP DVD's on the market now.  My favorite is still my first DVD of ELP called ""Welcome Back"" which was a re-release of the VHS version promoting the ""Black Moon"" era, of ELP.  ""From the Vaults"" was another great unexpected DVD of ELP, which is certainly better than the ""overdone psychedelic art"" flashing over ELP while they are performing the ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" DVD.  However, ""Pictures..."" is still a timeless ""must have"" for the ardent ELP fan.

But, this DVD, ""Beyond the Beginning"", truly is what I have been waiting for.  Actual performances of ELP back in their heyday.  Plus their ""California Jam"" in 1974, which is both the best and the worst feature on this DVD.  As others have said who are reviewing this DVD, the songs (sorry...I mean...performances), are all chopped up and out of sync.  There are cut-ins, just seconds after the performance starts, which is really annoying.  Plus, the DVD itself has tracking flaws, which cause the DVD to freeze at some points.  If this is the best effort they can make to put the ""California Jam"" together, well then, I guess we're stuck.

The one-hour documentary ""Beyond the Beginning"" is good.  Although, the boys DO repeat some of the things they've mentioned before on other documentaries (like this is the first time they're telling it), but, it's good to have a well done autobiography, no matter how many times (and different interpretations) that you have of it.  This time around, you do get to hear more emphasis on how Greg wasn't too particularly fond of Keith's ""Tarkus"", but, I never had any doubt that Keith would have such a ""power of persuasion"" with his ability to get his way.  Plus you learn more about how Greg and Carl kinda hold it against Keith for how all that orchestration during the ""Works"" tour, caused them to lose millions.  I am proud to say that I saw the orchestrated ""Works"" tour in Detroit in 1977, plus ELP came back to Detroit in December of 1977 as just the three, probably to try to recoup some of their losses.

Overall, I love having this DVD.  Even though there are some obvious ""out of sync"" singing and performing.  I also noticed on their outdoor performance of ""Fanfare"", that their hands aren't performing ""in sync"" with the sounds we're hearing.  I think, even the first couple of lines of Greg singing ""Watching Over You"" didn't match up with his lips.  Of course, it's hard to really say that this was the case, because it looks like Greg is singing and chewing gum at the same time.

The Robert Moog part was a yawner.  Eleven minutes of improvised thinking and speaking about his participation with ELP.  If you're an insomniac, and have a hard time falling to sleep, usually, about 6 and a half minutes of this Bob Moog ""blah-blah-blah"" should knock you right out.  I think on the third try, I made it all the way through the 11 minutes here.

The motor race bit wasn't too exciting either, but it does allow us to see some extra footage of the three guys doing something other than performing music.  It's an extra that we have an option to see over and over again, OR choose to never watch again at all.  It's something better than nothing.  I'd rather watch this than a Michael Bolton video.

Usually, I consider myself ""Proudly Unhipp"".  But, I'm glad to see that ELP still has a large world-wide fan base, which I am truly part of.  Even when I saw ELP here in Sacramento in 1992, I saw some high school teenagers who (obviously) learned from their parents, that ELP are an exceptional contribution to what Rock music is all about.  ELP is timeless.  Who, or what band, since the 1970's, can say that they are timeless today?  No one, no way!!!  ELP were one of the best, even amongst all the other legends from the seventies.  The seventies had so much diversity.  Back then, you can be unique at what you do for music, and rule the world.  Creativity was respected and promoted. You can't do that today.  If you try to be different, they won't even record you.  Many talented, brave, non-conformists, are fading away into obscurity, and with all this great technology at their hands.

This DVD has many flaws, but I'm sure more DVD's on ELP will eventually come out.  I think it's commercialism, the American way, to release a less-than-professional product, then re-release a better version of it later, just so they can sell it again.  I'll bet the ""Star Wars"" DVD's will be re-released over and over again for the next 30 years.  Giving us only a minor improvement over the previous release, with some reservation to leave some room for even yet more improvement for yet another re-packaging, re-selling effort.

It's obvious that some day, ELP's ""California Jam"", will be released in synchronized order and many other improvements.  It remains to be seen.  And I'm sure that it's coming someday.",1126310400,11,4950,4.660508083140877
2216109,3,B0007KVDXQ,"The mini documentary is awsome! The rehearsal footage is even more impressive-no ProTools, just real musicians actually playing, not programming their instruments.  The bad, as with most older bands, is the poor editing as well as the deteriorating video quality makes for some tough viewing.  For 25.00, its well worth it.  If this is supposed to be the be-all/end-all final ELP video, were in trouble....",1126051200,4,406,5.2153846153846155
2216110,5,B0007KVDXQ,"I ordered this dvd because I didn't already have it. When one has an obsession with a defunct band like ELP one of the advantages is that you can own everything about them. To my surprise, I was bowled over by this collection... I particularly liked the documentary on the rise and fall of ELP...it filled in some of the gaps for me...mostly confirming what I already knew. Nothing is, however, perfect and the flaws of the collection have been well illuminated by other reviews on this site (funny I've never met an ELP fan who wasn't intelligent and well-spoken). However, for me, I would have gladly paid the price of the dvd just to see the ELP in rehearsel part. Oddly enough it was the very last thing I watched and I was mesmerized by it. As a person who's musical taste is all over the map(I just like to say that I like GOOD music) I enjoyed many different bands and acts. ELP is one of the two acts that I believe are an integral part of my personality... years after the music was created it still stands up as does the sound of the band...everytime I have the rare pleasure of actually hearing a radio station play an ELP tune I turn to my wife and say ""Bet you somewhere some kid is saying 'Who was that!'""",1125964800,3,1219,4.304347826086956
2216111,4,B0007KVDXQ,"I was hoping for better, though this is quite a good DVD set. Most of the problems have been discussed earlier, such as out of sync sound quality, sometimes poor visual quality, edited performances etc.

During the video for ""Tiger In The Spotlight"" the band plays RIGHT NEXT TO A TIGER. Sure, the tiger was probably quite harmless and tame, but that's really not a good idea. By the end of the video it's basically laying on Greg's foot. I'd have definitely not liked to have been in his place.",1125878400,,495,4.5
2216112,5,B0007KVDXQ,"As a long-time fan and admirer of the band,I couldn't wait to receive my copy of this new 2-D.V.D.compilation produced by the folks at Sanctuary Music (U.K.)who in 2002 brought us the stunning ""How the West Was Won"" Led Zeppelin compilation. Well it was well worth the wait!
Disc 1 includes early-video's from the three prog.-rock superstars earlier bands (the Nice/King Crimson/The Crazy World of Arthur Brown) and various performances from the ground-breaking trio. This is amazing stuff here folks, in their day there was nobody ,in my opinion, who could touch them for sheer technical and sonic command of their instruments. The sound and visuals (painstakingly digitally re-stored) are quite simply astounding.
Watch and listen to the ""California Jam"" show and you'll witness a band at the complete apex of their career, Keith Emerson on the spinning piano just has to be seen to be believed.
  Disc 2 includes a brand-new 1 hour documentary of E.L.P. with very candid and humourous interviews with many people associated with the band over the years. It addresses the whole issue of why E.L.P. (unlike their contemporaries like YES,GENESIS & PINK FLOYD)never got that second-wind success in the 80'S and 90'S. There is also a fascinating look at the album cover's of the band with some very telling comments from Greg Lake.
  If your'e already a fan of the band this is an absolute must-have and if you're not, you certainly will be after seeing this fantastic retro-spective. From 1970-1974 Emerson, Lake and Palmer ruled the world and pushed and prodded the boundaries of modern popular music. All Hail E.L.P.!!!!!!!",1125878400,3,1624,5.071161048689139
2216113,4,B0007KVDXQ,"Cant really add to whats been said, except for a few random comments.

The good:  great to see all this footage and there is a good variety of sources and performances.  The Cal Jam video footage is as clean Ive ever seen it (having bought bootleg copies a couple of times), the Documentary Beyond the Beginning is  interesting and ELP actually sound like they are honestly sharing, not just being polite like on the Welcome Back Video.

(Thoughts: credit Palmer for Tarkus, forgive Keith for the orchestra tour-- I actually saw one of the few shows of that ill-fated tour at Soldier Field in Chicago, the bill included Foghat, Climax Blues Band and J. Giels-- seems we'd listen to about anything back then:) and lets thank Lake for being involved in the business end of all the excess and forgive him for not initially believing in Tarkus.

Further good, Palmer showing and playing the stainless steel drums on some wierd science show, just plain odd fun, especially the interview. Watching Emerson play, especially the piano, very good

The bad: why couldn't the sound be better? and in 5:1?
More Bad, the Cal Jam video is presented out of order, is slightly out of sync and is mising a couple minutes of the performance (did anyone mention that ABC edited the 7 virgins and a mule line in First Impression Part II?)

Even more bad, the haircuts after Brain Salad and  that Dr. Moog is no more :(. Also, the car racing footage with no explaination or comments, kind of useless.

The ugly:  At times the editing sucks.  The chapter switches on Cal Jam, which ""freeze"" even between sections that connect like Piano Improv and Take a Pebble, inexcusable.  The choppiness of the first disc edits at times like your basic home made boot; why no full version of Tarkus from Japan? -- I have the bootleg, and while they use cheesy effects (shooting behind sheets of plastic that reduce the viewable picture)its a good performance and should have been shown complete.

Further random thought:
These guys had awfully big BALLS!!!  (you listening Bon Scott?)

Examples, Emerson earnestly pounding at Honky Tonk Train Blues sitting directly across from the genius of Oscar Peterson!!!  Balls my friends.... (I can see the Producer of Peterson's short-lived show telling him how bringing on the rocking Emerson would be good for ratings).

Palmer playing a 5 minute drum solo (in any performance), with 2 minutes of it being hitting gongs and clanging a bell with his teeth.  Stainless steel balls... (or whatever gongs are made of)

Lake, alone on stage with an acoustic guitar singing.  That in itself is balls, but singing, ""a little sadder, a little madder, someone get me a ladder"", in front of 350,000 or whatever it was at Cal Jam.... Unplugged Balls !!!

Last few thoughts, after getting a Japaneese copy of Pictures on DVD, having the Masters from the Vault DVD and now this, who knew there were so many awesome versions of Take a Pebble out there?

Why are aren't there more performances of Trilogy material?

Further, who knew the Lake ballads would hold up all these years later, (occasional cheesy lyric aside), as often more timeless than the stage antics or butchered versions of jazz (i never really liked Rondo) or some of the classic adaptations(especially Pictures)?

Overall, I wanted the quality to be better, but I am still happy to have this, and hope ELP look back with no regrets at being one of the best performing and recording groups of one of the most exciting eras of music; which, much like their career, this DVD, as flawed as it is, helps to demonstrate.  (This last sentence is an homage to the length of the title of the triple live lp)",1125792000,8,3661,4.735015772870662
2216114,3,B0007KVDXQ,"I want to start off by saying that I am a long time Emerson, Lake, & Palmer fan, I was even at the California Jam concert featured in this DVD and have seen them play live many times throughout the years. This DVD has some very cool pieces of ELP's history like the live California Jam recording of Karnevil 9's Third Impression, but the DVD as a whole seemed very fragmented and slapped together. The songs being chopped up and edited at awkward places was very dissapointing. I think if your a die hard ELP fan like me you'll find portions of this DVD worth the price, but alot of the footage can be found complete on other ELP DVDs. The coolest parts of this package was the Cal. Jam selections I just wish they were not so hacked up.",1125360000,6,737,4.271428571428571
2216115,4,B0007KVDXQ,"Worth every penny. Sure it's out of synch a little, edited, muddy in places, but who cares?

2216117,4,B0007KVDXQ,"Its a big problem for me that the chapter breaks, as well as the audio and video are a tiny bit out of synch. As a keyboardist its very frustrating to watch Emerson's fingers be a 1/16 note off what I am hearing.  The awsome performance of ""Hoedown"" from Milan (Trilogy tour?) is a bit sped up (He's clearly playing in D, the original key...but pitch is E flat on soundtrack. When I try to go to a chapter break its not accurate...Go to Cal Jam First Impression and its starts on the words  ""..My Friends"" instead of the opening ""Welcome Back...""
  The Cal Jam is incomplete....the original ABC broadcast also included the end of ""Baba Yaga,"" which leads into the beginning of ""Gates of Kiev"" (from Pictures at an Exhibition) and includes a brief passage of Keith ""abusing his organ"" prior to the spinning piano sequence. (I have the same poor quality copy of this on video as many of you probably do so we  can verify it) This just shows the spinning piano and conclusion of ""Gate of Kiev."" The original ABC broadcast also had some brief voice over introductions (""...Mr. Keith Emerson...on acoustic piano"" etc) These are edited so some of the tunes are missing a second or two of the beginning. The order is different then the original ABC broadcast which freely mixed and matched incongruous elements....This is closer (I am assuming...I was not at the show in '74) to the actual ELP perfomance order  (for reference the ABC In Concert order was: Night 1. (all bands from Cal Jam)  ELP did Baba Yaga...Gate of Kiev...organ abuse...Spinning Piano...Gates of Kiev conclusion...Night 2. (Third actual broadcast--ELP and Black Oak Arkasas)  First Impression pt 2...Emerson Piano Improv/Trio Improv/Take a Pebble (conclsion)...Still You Tune me on/Lucky Man...Tocatta (Percussion movment only)...3rd Impression. The other 2 nights of the 4 night broadcast were Black Sabbath/Deep Purple/Rare Earth and Eagles/Seals and Crofts Earth Wind and Fire/ Rare Earth  (I have a complete stereo FM broadcast tape from 1974 if anyone is interested in a CD copy e-mail me)
  These complaints are not minor..However, the performances are so great that I will take the time to remaster and burn a new DVD from this with the sound precisely synchronized...its will be a  lot of work (these producers should have done a this in the first place)...but Emerson is so phenomenal that its worth it.",1124928000,9,2376,4.897755610972569

By far the most comprehensive video release yet from these guys......  Sure.....I wish the edits were not there, and I wish the sound was re-engineered into 5.1, BUT.....  It's still fantastic to have access to this video content (a full 4 hours and 10 minutes).  The documentary is a very interesting spin on the inner turmoil that led to the breakup...  By the way, Karn Evil 9/3rd Impression from Cal Jam 1974 is worth the price of the DVD alone!!",1124582400,2,568,4.423076923076923
2216119,4,B0007KVDXQ,"Hey, I'm the biggest ELP fan in California, and was even at the California Jam in Ontario, CA, and managed to get to the front of the stage right before the encore, so I love any new product having anything to do with ELP.

But, if I wanted to be just a bit critical....

The discs are not mixed in 5.1 sound.  It says Dolby Digital on the package, but the diagram next to it shows it's only in right/left stereo.  (...)
The first disc is a treasure trove of ELP performances, from beginning to later in their career, so you gotta love that.  But many performances are edited, or 'cut up' here and there.  Why would you not just present an entire song (albiet, a loooooong song) complete, instead of editing it and cutting it up?

The second disc is the Cal Jam, and it rocks too, but same here:  Sound is not 5.1, and there's some serious editing going on here.  Why not just present the entire concert as it happened, in order of sequence?  Instead, we start with Tocatta, then some (not all) edited versions of other material from there on.  My guess is that ABC, which filmed and broadcast the show, used the same footage that was broadcast over the air on their network, so it was edited for TV viewing and they just used that, or that's all they had to work with.

But the sound still could have been mixed properly (yes, I'm a sound-ophile).  You would think, why would someone go thru all the trouble of putting out an awesome product that is not quite as good as it could have been, and the the obvious answer has something to do with capitalism....

But hey, I'm being a bit too critical.... I'm still diggin' watching these performances on my big screen, and it still rocks the house, so close the windows and can't hear the phone, 'cause me and my Bud are gonna be turning it up tonight....",1124323200,5,1802,4.340298507462687

8047805,5,B0007KVDXQ,"This is an excellent collection of ELP video. I enjoyed it a lot. I highly recommend it. The only downside is that so many of the video clips are cut very short. I would greatly prefer that musical clips be shown in their entirety. The best example of this is the footage from the Isle of Wight. It is shockingly short. Fortunately this is available on its own DVD. The footage from Cal Jam is excellent. It is longer than any such clips I have seen before. But again, it is cut up. It frequently pauses for a moment between songs when it shouldn't. I have other versions of the Cal Jam video showing different parts of it. I will have to combine these two videos with the CD to make a more complete version. Why can't they simply release ELP (and Heart) at Cal Jam in their entirety ?",1452556800,,785,4.24

Disk 2 was a mishmash of things, rehearsal, but nothing substantial.  Some of the menu navigation didn't work (Example: the photos viewing option).  Note:  I have a decent BD/DVD player (Sony BDP-790) that normally plays and navigates anything.  I would still like to find a good copy of Hoedown from the Milan concert.  I will say my Amazon seller was very good and forthright.  Did not even want me to ship the disk back.  I wish when I was younger I was an AV nut and had recorded this for posterity over the air and on Super Betamax, etc.  I'm hoping that others have success using and enjoying these discs and my experience was a fluke.
NOTE:  I recently bought the ELP Brain Salad mini-boxed set (3 discs including the stereo DVD-Audio) from ELP's site.  Have yet to have a chance to audition it, need to get my family out of the house (shopping, work etc) THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND me cranking Toccata.
I am expecting great things.  As much as I love ELP, I wasn't up for the mega (I think $125.00 ? ) boxed set.  I saw ELP live on the BSS tour in Portland, OR, stunning show, long show.  4 sound towers - possibly quadrophonic?  It was great.  : )",1431388800,4,1323,4.396694214876033

However, we could have used a full-band version of Lucky Man instead of the Greg Lake ""ballad"" version from Cal Jam.

However, it is ELP!  And like many classic Rock bands, not alot of footage is available.  I saw them at the San Francisco Civic back in '73 for the Brain Salad concert, and several time since.  They are a great band and their songs are timeless.
