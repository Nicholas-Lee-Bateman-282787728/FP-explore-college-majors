2996482,5,B000X25F7I,"I lived in Baltimore during most of the time depicted in this TV series, and it's dead-on accurate.  It has always struck me as both odd and sad that some of America's most architecturally beautiful cities were also some of the most crime-ridden, and Baltimore is a shining example of this problem.
 The series has some shining performances (despite a slightly weak lead in Dominic West) and, most of the time, is utterly engrossing.
 Series one and three are my personal favorites, as series two is a departure from the main story line into a somewhat less intriguing (though no doubt accurate) depiction of the corruption and trouble along Baltimore's docks.
 The series, in the end, is both utterly entertaining and a striking indictment of America's second failed attempt at Prohibition (this time drugs, rather than alcohol), and specifically it's severely adverse effect on the poorest segments of our population.

 The Wire is, in my opinion, the best television series ever produced, and probably one of the most important.

 As far as pricing is concerned, please be aware that these are hour long episodes and as such you are buying the equivalent of 5 two-hour movies in each season, which makes the street price of $40-60 really quite reasonable.

2996485,4,B000X25F7I,"Seeing all the first four seasons of 'The Wire' together is both an exhilarating and depressing experience. Superbly plotted and written with characters as good as only American character actors allowed to settle into their roles can be, it nevertheless paints the most hopeless picture of urban decay, the drug culture in ever-younger children, the hopelessness of inadequate city and state funding and the powerlessness, and sometimes venality, of its politicians and city officials. It's mesmerising viewing, each episode augmenting and deepening the others, which is truly admirable given the multiplicity of writers and directors. Quite why the City of Baltimore ever allowed it to be filmed, let alone co-operated in the filming, one cannot imagine. It's as though Coca-Cola ran a national campaign that said ""Don't ever, under any circumstances, drink Coke""",1206230400,4,864,5.503759398496241

Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy, and The Jewel in the Crown for overall excellence.  Obviously The Wire is vastly different from those, as it is a completely American story.

Great ensemble acting, almost flawless.  Each season covers another angle within Baltimore's daily life (drug trade; the docks; politics; the school system).

Highly recommended if you like realistic depictions of life.  I would also strongly urge you watch this with captioning.

This was before cable and the good stuff; 'Naked City', The Twilight Zone', etc., was few and far between, it always depressed me that the medium wasn't better used to enlighten the masses.

8226641,3,B000X25F7I,"First of all, I am not a prudish person but I am getting a bit tired of HBO deciding that the only word worth repeating over and over in the English language is the ""F"" word.  It seems their characters, be it in Deadwood or The Wire have an obsession with this word and can't seem to talk intelligently without it.

While the acting in both series was excellent and the story line was intriguing, trying to figure out what the characters were actually saying in ""The Wire"" was a real challenge.  I realize that people in the ghetto speak their own language but, frankly, I fail to appreciate the fact that people who have responsible positions in society (the police in all their positions)also cannot get past using constant ""gutter"" language.  It assails my ears and, frankly, I may be naive in believeing that surely all people in higher positions do not feel the need to use gutter language throughout the day.

As in Deadwood (and I do not agree with those who created this series, that this was the everyday language of the people in Deadwood at that time), even though the story line was interesting, the acting well done (outside the fact that certain characters couldn't say a sentence without every third word being ""F____"")I stopped buying the series so as to get on to something entertaining but less assailing to my ears!

I doubt I will spend any more money on The Wire, as I watch movies for my own pleasure and to give me release from a busy day and, yes, quiet possibly to have a point made without a lot of potty mouth!",1234051200,,1537,4.491039426523297

[if only the politicians would watch it and take heed. tho' they probably, stupidly, just think it's entertainment.]
the entire series -- the entire message of this show -- is summed up literally in the first tiny dramatic arc, the the first 4-5 minutes of the first episode, in the very first words spoken by the characters after an alley game of dice or cards or something like that.",1230336000,,582,4.948979591836735

8226647,5,B000X25F7I,"For many years folks have recommended this series to me, but I had resisted for fear of it being too depressing. Well, it is pretty depressing, but it is also a wrenchingly honest depiction of inner city dysfunction that pulls few punches. It is also well acted, beautifully shot and directed and it is both illuminating and riveting. What else produced for the small screen can make those claims? Nothing else that I know of.

I could go on and on, but the short of it is this - see it. See it because seeing it helps you understand how bad it really is - the various worlds that The Wire is depicting. And while it is a gloomy view - how could it not be and still be honest - it is also peopled by such a wide array of characters many of whom are so wonderful that when all is said and done the show does not screech -""GIVE UP"" but rather ""PAY ATTENTION.""

And what does it depict: the ugly innards of bureaucracy; the extraordinary cultural malignancy that dominates so much of inner-city American life; the incredible obstacles confronting anyone who truly wants to make a difference; the cameraderie that develops when good people get together and really try; the hardship that will visit those who speak truthfully when few really want to hear the truth; the enormous wasted talent and energy of those who ravage our urban communities with their drugging and their vacuous violence and promiscuity; and the strange and perverse allure of it all.

As others have pointed out, Season Two is the weak link (I have not yet seen Season Five but I surely will.) but see it all. It is as if Dickens was reborn and wrote for HBO...",1222819200,,1629,4.478114478114478
8226648,5,B000X25F7I,"Do yourself a favor and sit down and watch at least the first season of the Wire. I feel it truly is one of the best TV series I've ever seen. The subject matter is pertinent and real, the writing is phenominal and the acting is excellent. THe series interweaves varying points of view regarding the drug trade and shipping docks in Baltimore from the dealer, police and political perspectives. A great entertaining thought provoking series.",1221696000,,441,4.815789473684211
