8327495,5,B001NOBH1S,It's an excellent romantic comedy. Not full of comedy either. Good balance. We're glad we bought it.,1417046400,,100,4.9411764705882355

8327497,4,B001NOBH1S,I bought this because I am a big fan of both Joanne Kelly (Warehouse 13) and Collin Ferguson (Eureka). The actors did not disappoint. I think Joanne Kelly did a particularly exceptional job. The story is cute and has a lot of potential. The script is just so - so. If I had not been such a big fan of the main actors already I might have a different opinion of the movie. It is really just the dialog that is lacking. It could have easily been a 5 star movie if more work had been put into the script. But I is certainly watchable. I think a lot of women will relate to it more than men.,1398643200,2,587,3.983050847457627
8327498,2,B001NOBH1S,I bought the movie because I had enjoyed Joanne Kelly in Warehouse 13 and Collin Ferguson in Eureka.  I really wanted them to do well.  It's not the best script ever.  I just felt absolutely no empathy with any of the main characters.  Joanne Kelly was flat and lacking pretty much any personality as the lead character... as they say you can play a boring person but you can't be boring in doing so.  I would recommend re-watching old episodes of Warehouse 13 or Eureka.,1386288000,4,471,4.4941176470588236
8327499,4,B001NOBH1S,I love this movie. Lucas Bryant is just too adorable and the story is good too. ;-) DVD came in good condition.,1385251200,3,111,4.090909090909091
8327500,5,B001NOBH1S,"I just adored this movie with I first saw it on Lifetime and kept it saved on my DVR for years because I couldn't find a DVD.  I was so excited to find this DVD on Amazon.  I think it is a great movie for first time mothers, especially those at home alone with the baby, perhaps on maternity leave, experiencing the challenges of new motherhood for the first time.  It's fun to watch a movie that makes you feel like you're not alone in some of the things you felt or thought and which can also make you laugh about them.  It's definitely a ""chick flick"", not really a guy's movie, but I think many of the women out there who are trying to balance work and motherhood will enjoy this movie with its good balance of drama and humor.",1364515200,4,731,4.163120567375887
