8456140,3,B005432SOE,"Not the greatest movie in the world but certainly watchable. This low budget 1996 movie was also released under the title A Face to Die For. Yasmine Bleeth plays a young woman with the left side of her face disfigured and the rest not left unscarred either from a car crash as a child that took her father's life. Her mother treats her like dirt and a slave, and constantly mentions her appearance to remind her she's no catch. Her sister is a party girl who seems content to leave the burden of their mother to her disfigured sister. She dreams of being a fashion designer and volunteers at the local community theater designing costumes while paying her mother and her bills working in an antique shop for Mr Pitt (well he's called Mr. Sturetsky in this one but Ian Abercrombie anyway). A courier notices the amount of cash happening with a transaction, and also overhearing a rude customer complain about the fact it is a cash only store decides to seduce the disfigured girl in order to persuade her to help get that cash in his pocket. This seems like a pretty cool plot on it's own but the movie actually changes direction a few times with at least three separate storylines revolving around the girl's life. Some characters from the initial part, return for the final part of her story.

The movie is interesting simply as it doesn't spend more than half an hour on one scenario for her to deal with. Overall the story is pretty ridiculous and is sort of uses Disney style who cares about realism, to tell a fairytale and relies upon meeting a couple of strangers who help her out a few times. Emily (Bleeth's character) is a bit too naive and stupid, especially in the first part of the movie to be believable, I guess they were kind of trying to make her like a Cinderella type character for that bit and couldn't work out how to do it any other way.

Spoiler alert but I want to talk about the ending as it was unsatisfactory enough a viewing experience to drop this a star in rating - I found the ending ultimately a let down. At that stage we were supposed to be watching a vengeance type film where a former meek person, now with a new face who became confident and got her life together can stop the con artist and violent guy and save her sister at the same time, yet the threat of him is ended simply by the sister shooting him. Maybe a more realistic than most films way of it happening but since the whole film had been so fairytale like realism up to then, not to mention it's so low budget (they probably should have used two actresses rather than just Bleeth for pre and post surgery events) that she looked exactly the same just without scars, and somehow looked exactly the same as the doctor's dead wife, and somehow no one from her past recognised her and things like this, so why not let her be the one to finish the events and achieve her goals?",1447027200,,2872,4.396616541353383

8456144,5,B005432SOE,"This movie is a spin off from Count of Monte Cristo. A innocent person place in prison, makes a friend of one of her cell mates, then decides when she leaves jail to make a big name for herself & soon meet up with the man whom put her in Jail and takes revenge on him.
I wonder if the writers Marvin Werlin & Mark Werlin for the Face, know this at the time?

Yasmine Bleeth was incredible beautiful in this movie (with or without the scars).

I hope they never make a REMAKE of this film. It not as good as the original film.",1409788800,,525,3.9904761904761905
