A teenage girl is found murdered in the high school. A black janitor is accused of the murder, and taken before a grand jury. There is a trial. Other janitors testify against him (this clears them as suspects). The first jury is deadlocked. Clarence had a record and was convicted for carrying a short-barreled firearm. There will be a second trial. They show what was done by the investigator, he didn't investigate the other janitors. The second jury says guilty, it will go to the Court of Appeals. The defense lawyer wants to review the exhibits, but they went missing! They can show the bias in Conroe Texas. Will Clarence fight for his life? His supporters will use publicity about the prejudices in this case.

Later Clarence is sentenced to death and taken away. They seek a more experienced lawyer for the appeal. Can they find a better suspect? One janitor had photographs of young girls and a police badge. A woman tells about a confession from her ex-husband. The Prosecutor is rewarded with a judgeship. One janitor has information but is afraid of the Texas Ranger. The lawyers talk to another janitor. Will he take a polygraph test? Later he says he didn't remember anything, but he is innocent. They know the judge and prosecutor met in private, and the evidence is missing. Mr. Robinson testifies. Will a court reporter talk? She would face a reprisal. Mr. McCloskey works to help the unjustly convicted. He talks to a janitor who used to work there, who has bad dreams.

Can John remember the events of that day? Yes. He saw Ackerman and Robinson with that girl. There are protesters in the street asking for Justice. There is a stay of execution. Three men assault Anderson and tell him to keep his mouth shut! There is another court appearance, Anderson speaks. Will they blame the court reporter? Yes. The trial judge testifies. Judge Pickett expresses his opinion about the trials, the witnesses, and recommends a new trial held elsewhere. People cheer this decision! The conviction was set aside. Does the system work? Clarence was saved by a miracle, but never received compensation or any apology.

This is based on the book by Nick Davies. McCloskey has since rescued fourteen men from death row. How many other innocent men were executed since then? Abolishing the death penalty will not prevent convicting the innocent, only long prison terms instead. When Tom Mooney was finally freed after twenty years in prison his deteriorating health soon led to his death. We need an improved justice system to reduce or eliminate convicting the innocent. Politics can always affect trials and juries, human error continues. I wonder who would have been framed if there was no black man among the janitors? That young girl was involved in a school activity and went to the rest room alone. There is a lesson in that.",1440633600,,2885,4.845841784989858
