3086051,5,B0012909R2,"I use many workout videos when not attending classes at the gym or college and Amy Bento provides a great challenge. Her cues are definitely for someone who already is familiar with workouts. She is so motivating and has an alternate gal showing less stress, you don't have to do all the jumping jacks. The video has so many choices on the menu to vary your workout for a shorter workout to an absolute ultimate workout. This is a video that will last you forever. Finally, a great workout in your own home. Definitely worth the $$ Spent!",1212019200,,538,4.5
3086052,5,B0012909R2,"Tuff workout!  Amy Bento is high energy and fast paced.  I wanted something new in my routine and it was just to fast for me.  Some people might be able to keep up with her, but I sure couldn't.  I hate to give it a bad review, because it is an excellent fat burner and heart pumper, but it's very advanced and not for the ""two left feet"" kind of people.
Amy has a great personality, I will look for more of an intermediate workout from her.",1210809600,,441,4.0344827586206895
3086053,5,B0012909R2,"I really enjoy this workout. It's very high pace and high energy.  There is an option to combine the workout in different ways so that you can customize which combos and intervals you'd like to do.  It's not hard to follow once you've done it once or twice and it's lots of fun.  Although you do need a lot of space to do the full workout, you can motify it to fit into a smaller space.",1210204800,,386,4.052631578947368

3086057,2,B0012909R2,I am an advanced exercise person who also has music training.  I feel I can follow most anyone.  Amy cues you after the fact and I found this difficult to follow.  There's no building up to any moves - it's just full out do it and try to keep up.  I get too frustrated with this video to even want to bother with it.  That's bad.,1243209600,6,329,3.9242424242424243

3086060,5,B0012909R2,"Here's a quick test to find out if you are read for this DVD.  I'm going to say a word and you say/do whatever first pops into your brain  (hint: it's an exercise term).

PONY

Did you A) Mentally execute the move or B) Feel some stirring grey matter and after five seconds said, ""Oh, I know what that is.""

If you mentally executed the move with form this is probably a program you will enjoy.
If you fall into group B, you would likely be fine with this DVD if you don't mind previewing it several times before expecting to perform very well, and if you don't mind high impact, fast paced choreography.  If you are person who allows not being able to catch right on to a new program to discourage you or can't keep up with an intense workout right now, come back to this DVD later.

This program lasts longer than most low impact videos.  I think it is very well done with a great progression of moves.  I was so happy to find a cardio workout that was actually a challenge after having came up through the ranks.  If you've found yourself not able to really push yourself with your current workout collection - you will find a great addition here.

Note:  You do not need an airplane hanger for this workout.  I exercise in a 15 by 15 foot room with furniture around the perimeter that reduces it to approximately 8 by 10 feet.  The only modifications I had to make were for ""Football Feet"" and ""Around the Ring"" and for these the only difference is I would make two 'loops' to the instructor's one.",1226016000,4,1502,4.298932384341637
3086061,1,B0012909R2,I've been using video tapes daily for 8 or 9 years;  I've lost weight and inches.  With Amy Bento I lost patience.  She usually tells you what to do after she starts doing it leaving you flat-footed which may be preferable to her not telling you about weight shifts or directional changes.  Do not use this tape if you have a slightly sore knee or if you don't want one.  What a waste of time and money.,1222992000,10,403,4.181818181818182

If you are in a hurry you can select different ""NRG mixes."" The shorter one is about 33 minutes long. On my days off, I will do the whole DVD. This is definitely an advanced workout and I like how she doesn't break down the combos too much. If you fumble, you can just bounce around get yourself back on track. There are a lot of traveling moves in this DVD, but you can do them in place. Also, sometimes, I do not feel like jumping, so I will do the modified versions.

8244804,5,B0012909R2,"I give this 5 stars because not only is it a fun floor aerobic workout that uses no equipment but it also includes sections from APX if you want to do strength training using a variety of equipment. It is everything all in one DVD. I like the floor aerobics because it reminds me of typical floor aerobics with no kickboxing moves or dance moves (I enjoy them but it is nice to have a break from them). I called it Traditional...Modernized because she includes intervals that is common now that was not before. If you are an advanced floor aerobic person, you may classify this more Intermediate/Advanced due to your heart rate level. Mine didn't rise as much as it does during other DVDs but it is still a great workout. I did not find the cuing bad. She says enough that you can follow along. The choreography was complex enough to keep it interesting but easy enough to follow. The more space you have the more fun it is to do the ""race"" and ""football"". I used all the space I have which is 12'x10'.",1388448000,,1002,4.363636363636363

8244806,4,B0012909R2,"I can't believe the energy Amy Bento has! Most of the moves take a little time to master, but you definitely get a good workout once you have.  Constant movement, jumping, bouncing, lunges, squats, arms constantly in the air.  Recommend but make sure you have enough space in your living room....travelling with a lot of these sequences you can easily bump into a table or couch. :)",1360022400,,382,4.686567164179104

Not everyone knows how to do a ""sashay... grapevine..., 360 turn, etc."".  I couldn't follow it.  Moves too intricate; requires a lot of coordination.  Sadly I don't have it.",1312588800,5,347,4.5
8244808,3,B0012909R2,"Pros:

- High calorie burn
- Amy is upbeat and encouraging
- Interesting combos
- A good variety of moves that works the whole body
- One of Amy's assistants shows lower impact alternative moves

Cons:

- Repetitive & outdated music
- Amy's voice can get kind of annoying
- Poor cueing
- Requires a lot of space to move about in
- Can be hard on the knees

Bottom Line: It was hard for me to follow Amy. She didn't really explain the moves she was about to do in advance. For example, often she would either immediately begin a move and then explain what it was or just start the move and yell out the name of it and leave it to the viewer to figure out what she was doing. It is a little more difficult to do this workout unless you have a lot of room space, although you can modify it to work with the space you do have as well. I workout regularly doing weightlifting and cardio. I consider myself to be in good shape and this was an effective and challenging workout for me. I understand that I would be able to follow her cueing better if I continued to do this workout longterm, but overall I think that I will be trying out other cardio workouts that I think would work better for me.",1276214400,6,1191,4.120689655172414

This by far is one of the most CONFUSING tapes I've ever tried to use. Yes, it is a good cardio but half the time I'm rewinding just to figure out what the heck she just did! There is not explanation of the moves just Amy calling out names that mean basically nothing to me. I usually just get so frustrated because I get lost or thrown off and by the time I've got it down she's moved on to something else. Do NOT buy this if you are not a dance/move EXPERT.

I came to Amazon to check for any of her tapes I didn't have, and found this Hi/Lo Extreme.  I read the mixed reviews, went ahead and ordered it, and am very glad I did.  I agree with the reviewers who criticized her lack of advance cuing.  However, as someone who knows Amy's moves, and with the amount of repitition in the tape, it wasn't a big issue.  It was interesting to do this 2007 DVD, having seen the strength of her more recent workouts.  The music was definitely dated; her latest DVD's have terrific music.  In her later workouts, she also has more variety of movement.  This being said, it is a kickass workout!  As with all her tapes, she gave combinations followed by intense intervals.  My favorite combo is #3, and favorite interval was #2's ""football drill"" one.  It was really a super fast, dancy grapevine, and great fun.  It's a one hour long, high intensity cardio workout.  If that's what you're looking for, this is it.",1269043200,,1100,4.517766497461929
