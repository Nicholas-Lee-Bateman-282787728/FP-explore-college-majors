I first saw this when it ran on PBS in 1998, and was pretty amazed - about halfway through - to see some cousins of my dad's.  I was completely blown away.  A wonderful wonderful film.",1272067200,5,356,4.9

8272402,5,B00197PP0I,"As a family history rereacher, I really can relate to the DVD, Family Name. I personally have been researching the surnames
of my family wondering if anyyone with the same surname could be related to my family. This product delivers a lot of insight
into what is involved in family history researh including, intervieiws, visiting county courthouses, reviewing documents such
as wills, estate records and census records and travel connected to trying to find answers, I discovered this little jewel
on Amazon and have shared it with my fellow genealogy club members.
