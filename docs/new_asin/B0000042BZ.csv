1183169,3,B0000042BZ,"This is a bit dated and often comes off as corny. I like that it is a traditional presentation---no space aliens or trapeze artists. Making an opera movie versus taping a live performance is going to be a little different and they can do things you can't do on stage. That's great and does add to the experience. However, it's easy to go overboard when short scenes or shots can be staged.

There are some extreme closeups that are almost comical. There are a few shots of Pavarotti which reminded me of one of those ""Guys Night in Las Vegas"" movies.

You've got a great cast and very good performances. I however found the more recent stage performances better than this. It's hard not to award 5 stars to anything with Pavarotti but as mentioned, the ""movie"" aspect is often excessive. I really liked this one better and it's a great deal:

""An exhilarating live recording from the Opernhaus Zurich stars acclaimed baritone Leo Nucci as the namesake of the opera, alongside the inimitable Elena Mosuc as his daughter Gilda, Piotr Beczala as the Duke of Mantua, and Lazslo Polgar as Sparafucile.""

1183171,5,B0000042BZ,"I am not into nit picking unless there is a good reason to do so and there is not in this case.

It is simply marvellous. Nobody could complain about the well lit wonderful local filming locations in Mantua itself. The last Act is a visual treat - so much better than a film of a theatrical production at say the ROH - dark and dingy.

Wixell is a convincing and eloquent brusque and bluff Rigoletto his appearance as Monterone as well is a great theatrical touch that could only be pulled off on film. Gruberova has not the strength of voice as say Scotto or the sheer coloratura flexibility of Sutherland, but is convincing visually and vocally. In fact in profile in the duets Wixell and Gruberova share some degree of likeness and one could well take them for father and daughter: a nice pairing for the purposes of this film. The same could be said for Pavarotti as the Duke and Vergara as Maddalena where the sexual chemistry is in full flow. The quartet, Act III, with these great pairs make a memorable scene in both visual and musical terms.

Given that Wixell and Gruberova tick the box what of the third main character the infamous Duke of Mantua? Well Pavarotti to my ears is the best out there. Plenty of the famous squillo, top notes sustained with ease and beauty, plenty of the great mezza voce which is so important in order to sing this role perfectly. Bergonzi may actually sing the role better on the DG album, but it is an edited untheatrical portrayal that sounds wooden and artificial. Almost as if Bergonzi was singing concert arias. Here, Pavarotti IS the Duke! As he beams into the camera, ""Welcome to my world!"" - what a rascal!

Furlanetto supplies the requisite grottiness and low life scum element while Barbieri as the less than loyal Giovanna offers another seedy characterisation from the political and sexual hot house that was the Duchy of Mantua.

Very up-to-date, a great performance, well played and well directed. I cannot recommend this DVD too highly. It is simply magnificent. Get it!

Take me to Mantua! And for lovers of great rail journeys out there why not hop on to the brand new Paris-Venice service operated by ""Thello"" and spend a week exploring Mantua and Ferrara and the Veneto. You can go by sumptuous brand new overnight sleeper in cabins for two or four or even three. Or there is the day service. All at very reasonable prices. Travel green as well - you are not dumping clouds of poison gas on the people below from a budget airliner. And safer!

What can I say? This was my first exposure to opera as a kid. (God bless PBS.)

It's of course a ridiculous story. But the singing stuck in my throat, and in my brain.  I've seen other performances of Rigoletto, and film versions of other operas since; I've always come back to this as a benchmark. Pavarotti is great here.

There were oddly-edited sequences, and the Foley work was really obvious. Oh, and the extreme close-ups of Pavarotti and other principals were disconcerting.  But I understood better after reading the liner notes from the director, that this was meant to be a video work. I purchased this because I was performing in the chorus of a production of this opera and wanted to watch the chorus. I was somewhat disappointed that the chorus shots were a little scanty.

1183194,4,B0000042BZ,"We had the good fortune to attend our first opera, an abridged version of Rigoletto, in Venice last summer at the Palazzo Musica ([...] The venue was an authentic villa, or palazzo, located on the Grand Canal, and the audience of about 50 people moved from room to room within the palazzo for the various scenes. The voices and musicians were outstanding, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But what really made it worthwhile was the ""homework"" we did before our trip, by viewing this DVD of Rigoletto, with Pavarotti, so that we could familiarize ourselves with the libretto, understand the plot and characters, and become better acquainted with Verdi's beautiful musical score.

The DVD opera is complete, unabridged and wonderfully performed. Pavarotti's voice was magical, as expected. But the big surprise was the performer who sings the part of Gilda. Not an attractive woman, unfortunately - she would be well-cast as Frankenstein's bride - but her sublime voice is the stuff of ""pearly gates"", heavenly.

We liked that the DVD opera is really a ""movie"", not just a static film of a stage performance. The camera moves, and the director uses appropriate camera angles, lighting, close-ups, etc that make the performance much more engaging for the viewer.
We were surprised how much we enjoyed this DVD, as we are complete opera novices, but we loved it. And, of course, we loved the live performance in Venice even more - one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Don't miss it if you are planning a trip to Venice. Ciao!",1374364800,,1545,4.915708812260537

1183197,5,B0000042BZ,Excellent recording.  Of course no one can surpass Luciano Pavarotti or Verdi in my mind.  I enjoyed the fact that the Opera was filmed in Italy which made it even better.,1364774400,,171,4.483870967741935
1183198,4,B0000042BZ,"First off, I have to admit I think the plot of Rigoletto is ridiculous.  And -- for those who will protest -- no, the plots of many great operas are NOT ridiculous. Second, the production values were way over the top in this DVD, and although occasionally, the settings were wonderful, they were also absurd.  Third, the singer of Gilda just couldn't act, nor was she pretty (when one of the courtiers exclaimed, ""Beautiful!"" I was attempted to shout back, ""Get glasses!"")  However, the singing is glorious.  Pavarotti is amazing (and he knows it). Wixell is a terrific Rigoletto -- and, in his case, a bit of overacting doesn't hurt, and Gruberova's voice is stunning.  The orchestra is also terrific.  The DVD is worth it for Pavarotti alone, in my opinion -- he is at his prime, and he makes the well-worn Duke's arias alive and gloriously, insolently new.",1364601600,,859,4.731543624161074

1183200,5,B0000042BZ,"I'm not a perfectionist or fanatic opera buff, though a lot of fine performances by Pavarotti, Sutherland, Freni, Kewana, Troyanos, and many others have flowed under my bridge.

I recently purchased a relatively small 32"" high def because a big chunk of my substantial dvd collection is from jazz, classical and opera performances of many years past. Not too good for a 52"" screen.

Ok, so I hauled this out this afternoon, turned on the subtitles and let it flow through a good sound system. I often wonder what opera I would choose to show to a friend or relative not familiar with the genre. Sure, Boheme (I love the Australian version), Turandot.... But as this cranked up I found myself sucked right into its production values and singing. Proper chicanery by courtiers who would sell their mothers for a dime, a look from Pavarotti that screams 'I'm a cad who can have what I want and, yeah, sing' (which he may have been) and the revelations of Wixell and Gruberova, neither of whom I have seen in person or on film.

What I liked about the production is that it truly revealed what opera is as a romantic and oft corny thing. It flowed and, despite the very  unhappy ending, left me smiling and wanting to share it with someone other than my wife who popped in and out while trying to get some work done.

Why oh why can't our broadcast media give us music like this????? We know the answer but films like this one remind us we can do better to educate friends, kids and family about opera , which is now too expensive for most of us to enjoy in truly high quality.",1361059200,,1573,4.447916666666667

Dont leave the following discourage you from buyint, it is still worth it, Im just explaining why I didint give the 5 stars. The transfer to digital could be better. Maybe it was done at a time when TV screens were smaller and blue-ray was not a reality. Even for a DVD it could improve, this is a suggestion for new editions.",1356912000,,608,4.419642857142857
1183202,3,B0000042BZ,"I don't know.  I like it, but I don't.  I'm an avid believer that if you have a nice home theater setup with a large screen, then you should expect sharp visuals and clean audio.  Being an old opera production, the video shows its age.

The audio and vocal performances are quite good, and will come across nicely with your home theater.  I would enjoy this much better if produced in HD but keeping the elegant staging.

1183205,5,B0000042BZ,I bought this DVD over all others because of the fine reviews. The reviewers were correct. An incredible cast and story absolutely shocking with great location scenary which I always prefer over most staged performances. The whole show is Ingvar Wixell with a couple great famous arias by the then young Pavarotti. My only complaint as always is not enough subtitles. This is a keeper.,1300665600,,385,4.938461538461539
1183206,4,B0000042BZ,"Yes, the acting of Regoletto shines all the way through this film/opera. The filming is also good in terms of at 80's. Pavarotti truly showed his 'golden' voice in this production. Worth to watch it.

Only one thing I am not perfectly satisfied which is the recording. The orchestra sound isn't the best, especially at the loudest parts. I think maybe the recording engineering didn't set the 'peak' volume right. (maybe I am wrong, no offense here)",1279929600,,449,4.8311688311688314
1183207,5,B0000042BZ,"Rigoletto was never my favourite opera as far as the plot is concerned but I was really impressed with this production. What a fine blend of music and drama! I normally prefer staged performance to the film version but this film is fantastic. Pavarotti as a duke is superb. He fits the role perfectly and does he act here! Yes, Pavarotti actually can act. Everyone here is great. Ingvar Wixell sings and acts a very believable Rigoletto.

Edita Gruberova, perhaps, is not the best Gilda in the world but her performance is rock solid, nothing to complain about. A portrait a bit too stereotypical, perhaps? Her signing is great though. Furlanetto as Sparafucile on the other hand is another surprise: picturesque, perhaps too much over the top with his dramatic make-up. After all he is supposed to be an assassin and not a street bum. But dramatically and visually very effective and striking.

Even the small roles are performed superbly, notably Marullo, who took two characters to create (an actor and a singer). He steals every scene he appears in. Another interesting character here is Giovanna who is played by legendary Fedora Barbieri, a true master of the art.  What she does with such a small and insignificant role of Giovanna has to be seen. She is a pure delight to watch.

Also notice that Wixell plays both Rigoletto and Monterone. It just adds a nice touch to the whole action. Wonderful.

The locations are picturesque but at the same time operatic and don't really detract from the action.

The very first scene (the feast at the Duke's court) is mind-blowing. Ponnelle took the full advantage of the film possibilities as opposed to stage production and as a result we have absolutely amazing dramatic experience of this famous opera.

Some moments are overdone or just plain ludicrous, like Rigoletto hanging on the balcony. But they are rare and don't detract much from the great overall impression.

I love it. If you want to own just one version, this would be my choice. That is, besides the one with Tito Gobbi whose Rigoletto is a class in himself.",1277078400,,2075,4.792717086834734
1183208,5,B0000042BZ,"Real opera lovers are a wee tad finicky, as the one- and two-star reviews of this DVD demonstrate. Real opera lovers seem to have a Platonic Ideal of the opera in their cavernous consciousnesses, a template of what Joe Verdi intended, from which any deviation is risky. Real opera lovers don't take well to 'film' productions of their idolized operas. Even if they are now ultra-pecunious enough to sit in the orchestra, they recall their youthful evenings in 'paradise' (the highest balcony) as the best of their lives, and they need that distant, almost inaudible timbre in the tenor's voice to sustain their enthusiasm. Real opera lovers KNOW whose performance, attested only by repute or perhaps by a tinny recording, was sans pareil for all time.

Me? I'm just a guy who goes to the opera for the fun of it, and I'm ready to be pleased. I'm also a musician by trade, which leads me to cut quite a lot of slack for the professional sisters and brothers, and inclines me to care more about the sounds I hear, the music itself, than about the staging or acting. Yes yes, I know opera as an art aspires to totality, to the sublime unison of drama and music. But realistically, friends, the unison is most often imbalanced: wonderful music, dopey libretto. Can you earnestly argue otherwise? Particularly about the operas of Giuseppe Verdi?

Case in point: Rigoletto! The script is a squalid and improbable melodrama. Without music, it would be snored off the stage. Rigoletto is a horrid little beast, deformed as much in mind as in body, and he's more convincingly gullible than devious. The Duke of Mantua is an odious tyrant. Everyone in the cast is besotted with evil except Gilda, Rigoletto's cloistered daughter, whose purity of being must be taken on faith. The story is grotesque, the characters are grotesque... but the music! ah, the music is celestial! Even the vile assassin is given celestial music to sing. But does any real opera lover ever complain about 'cognitive dissonance'?

I can almost promise you, dear reader, that even if you think you've never seen or heard Rigoletto in your life, you will snap to attention at the Duke's first major aria, and say to yourself ""why, I know that music! So this is where it comes from!"" And you'll have such epiphanies several more times before the final curtain. It's the Duke's voice you'll remember as you leave the theater, or turn off the DVD player. It's the joyous lilt of the debauched Duke's arias that you'll find yourself singing in the shower. The most essential item in a production of Rigoletto is that the Duke's role be sung superbly, and recorded equally well. Forget any other quibbles: Luciano Pavarotti sang this music, as people said about Caruso, like a God. If you've ever wondered why Pavarotti was venerated, this DVD will answer your doubts. You can decide for yourself whether he could also 'act'. It's an insignificant question.

Ingvar Wixell is almost ludicrously ugly in his make-up as the hunch-backed Rigoletto, and his posturing verges on silliness, but once again, IT'S The Music, Stupid! Wixell's tormented, interiorized vocal art makes emotional sense out of Verdi's twisted musical musings. If the visuals annoy you, opera lovers, just shade your eyes and watch the subtitles.

Coloratura soprano Edita Gruberova  soars. That's her job. She doesn't look childish enough for the role, but she conveys her nun-like innocence in her voice, and she sings in tune! Not a minor accomplishment for a Verdi specialist! What's more, she has the musical wisdom to ""comp"" to Pavarotti in their duets, not to attempt to upstage him. Nobody could upstage Pavarotti in this music.

Okay. I'm almost finished.

Verdi outdid himself in Rigoletto. The music is iconic. Unforgettable. Rigoletto is one warhorse that deserves to be ridden as long as opera houses stand and opera lovers are willing to spend an Afghani's life wages for a single evening in a box seat.",1259107200,,3945,4.877611940298507

1183220,5,B0000042BZ,"There are so many reasons to like this film version of Verdi's Rigoletto. So many people have already listed them I feel somewhat redundant in listing them again, but I had to add my ""2 cents.""

The main reason to get this really is Ingvar Wixell's Rigoletto. He is to baritones what Callas was to sopranos... A SINGING ACTOR. He has the ability to make you feel for him, to despise him, to laugh with him, all the emotions. His is the most believeable jester I've ever had the pleasure of seeing and hearing. His singing is excellent as well, like molten lava, even if his top is a bit pushed. I also thought it wonderfully ironic to have him play both Rigoletto & Monterone- that way the curse is even more like a personal thing. If you liked Wixell in this, you'll love him as Scarpia in the Arena di Verona production of Tosca with Eva Marton (available from Kultur on DVD).

Obviously Pavarotti is another reason to get this. Vocally his Duke is impressive and no one captures that same kind of mischeiviousness like he can. That said I do agree with another review that the recording of his part seems to be overly loud- like he was mic'd too closely. I didn't find the same true with the other singers and in fact, Gilda's ""Caro nome"" required me to raise the volume a lot.

Gruberova's Gilda is wonderful as well. To me she has one of the most sumptuous coloratura voices ever. Her voice is never reedy or thin like some coloraturas, she has a heft and richness that is throughout her range. Her floating pianissimos are also simply astounding.

There are really no weak links here to me- I can cite some flaws, but overall this is a quality production and lots of fun to watch.
Highly recommended ******",1195344000,,1712,4.460063897763578
1183221,5,B0000042BZ,"Never mind if it is not a stage production but a film.
It is tons more dramatic and entertaining than 'Romeo and Juliet' starring Leaonard Whiting and others, though the setting is almost the same. The reason? The music, of course.
Even if Pav was never a skilful actor on stage, in this film he portrayed a very convincing Duke of Mantua. Edita Gruberova's Gilda is heart-wrenchingly sung and portrayed. All the rest of the cast is great - Ferrucio Furlanetto, then so young and slim as to escape notice visually, is a real vocal discovery. And his acting is also very coherent with his singing.
The only slight weakness that could be picked lies in the title role - this jester is hardly funny, full of serious mentality and schemy political sense. The unanimously stenturion singing style of Wixell may not fit the role of the cursed jester as well as the cursing Count.
Otherwise, there really is nothing to flaw this spectacular production, showing Pavarotti in his prime PLUS good acting skills as a rare bonus!",1191801600,,1017,4.719101123595506
1183222,4,B0000042BZ,"This is a wonderful ""Rigoletto"".  It is full of drama.  The signing from the three principals beyond reproach.  The orchestral playing is dramatic and smooth as silk, although the balance favors the singers excessively.  Some film scenes are breathtaking in their beauty.

I had always thought that opera created specifically for video would have many advantages over staged productions.  However the reverse seems
generally true to me.  I suppose it is because operas are indeed great works of the theater, and they need the ethos of the theater, including the audience interaction to shine.  Or is that the producers lack a certain artistic sensitivity and imagination?  Having said that, this is the most successful production of opera out of the theater that I have seen on video.

It seems to me that the music dramas of Richard Wagner are most ripe for imaginative productions for video out of the theater.

A word about the sound.  The DTS 5.1 sound track is of very inferior quality.  It is top heavy with a screeching string tone, the brass is all lip and no bell, the singers are all head and no chest voice.  The bass quality is poor and largely absent.  Happily the PCM 2 channel stereo tracks are much better.  The bass is full, the only problem being a balance of the signers over the orchestra that is less than optimal.

A word about sound tracks on DVD opera.  Both Dolby digital and DTS 5.1 use lossy digital compression.  For large scale musical works such as opera, any lossy compression is going to produce inferior results and unpleasant digital artifacts, which on this recording are horrendous.

The 2 channel PCM tracks are lossless digital feeds of true CD quality.  Fortunately most operas on DVD have these tracks.  The multichannel Dolby and DTS tracks are contrived from two channel stereo in any event on most opera DVD productions.  Therefore for viewers who have home theater multichannel systems they are much better off having their audio visual preamps or receivers, produce the ambient surround effect in Dolby PLx Music for five channel systems, or Dolby PLIIx Music for seven channel systems.  I do not recommend the Cinema, or settings other than Music, for opera.  The seven channel PLIIx is significantly more effective than the  five channel PLx, at conveying a realistic sense of space and ambiance.

The way the system is set up is to connect the DVD player to the audio visual preamp or receiver using the digital interface using a digital cable, which on most players is optical.  On some it may be coaxial SPDIF.  Select 2 channel PCM on the DVD audio menu.  Set the input of the  preamp or receiver to the the appropriate digital connection, and select the appropriate version of Dolby PLx or PLIIx for your system.

Unless your system is superb, and has very good speakers for ALL channels you will be better off listening in standard stereo.  The center speakers in particular, tend to be poor in most set ups, with very few stellar performers to choose from.  All the surround speakers need to be high quality full range speakers, of a quality comparable to the fronts.  All speakers need to be carefully balanced.  If these caveats do not pertain to your multichannel system you will almost certainly get the best results listening in stereo.

A well set up surround system, can however bring a real sense of ""being there"", that can not be matched by even the best two channel systems.",1191715200,,3438,4.79557069846678
1183223,5,B0000042BZ,"There are two main reasons to get this dvd - 1) the cinematographic and artistic realization of a very literal interpretation of Verdi's favourite opera, 2) Gruberova.

This is a sort of verismo version of Rigoletto. I think this is deliberate - it is filmed in a lavish Parmesan location, the characters, particularly Rigoletto, are played in a fairly non-stereotyped way (except perhaps Pavarotti but that owes more to the fact that he actually can't act very well), there is an emphasis on providing a coherent, integrated vision of the work.
This is probably quite apt given that it is a film rather than a staged adaptation of the work - a lot of effort has gone into the acting and making the characters seem very real human beings.
The key to this is perhaps Gruberova since I have always found Gilda to be the least convincing of characters in the opera yet with this nuanced performance, not to mention utterly beautiful singing replete with superb coloratura, she does cast a really credible Gilda that comes of age and is fatally abused.
Gruberova is truly terrific; if Gobbi is the ultimate Rigoletto, then Gruberova is the ultimate Gilda - forget Callas who is not sweet sounding enough and not convincing as an 'innocent flower', forget Sutherland, forget modern performers such as Cortrubas and Schafer, Gruberova is the one!
Gruberova apart, we have Pavarotti at his peak - not the greatest of actors but not terrible at least, and at this age he looks the part, Wixell - fine acting performance whereby he plays Rigoletto as a fairly normal human being that is just a bit smaller and uglier than the rest, as compared to, for example, Gobbi who plays Rigoletto in a more stereotyped manner. Wixell has a powerful but not beautiful voice and consequently such great solos as 'deh non parlar' and the final death scene perhaps transmit a little less emotional meaning than might otherwise be the case with a more tender sounding Rigoletto. Nevertheless, such scenes are still imbued with emotion such is Ponelle's cinematographic work - I particularly like the cinematographic realization of the death scene where father and daughter are sort of isolated in a boat on the river and Gilda's death appears as if not noticeable to anyone in the world but Rigoletto which somewhat highlights Rigoletto's isolation; however, Gobbi and also Gavanelli from the recent Covent Garden/McVicar production have far superior tonality which allows for Rigoletto's hidden tenderness to come out much more. Gobbi, in particular, was able to produce a real Jekyll and Hide of a Rigoletto where Wixell here plays him in a more literal way - consistent with the style of the film. It is an interesting interpretation but I prefer Gobbi.

Everything else is nice. Sometimes the directing descends into cliche where we have a lot of annoying and unconvincing 'evil laughs' particularly from Pavarotti that belong more to pantomime than opera. Similarly the close ups of Monterone look a little ridiculous though i think the playing up of the psychological impact on Rigoletto of 'la maledizione' is a nice touch. It emphasizes the role that Rigoletto plays in his own downfall - so desperate to protect himself and his daughter that he is willing to tread on everyone else and their daughters beside! In trying to adapt to survive the brutality of his fellow citizens he has become so corrupted by the true 'maledizione' that is the Duke's rule, court and all in the vicinity that it has contaminated everything he loves in spite of his best efforts.

This is a Rigoletto that is a more complete and sophisticated interpretation therefore than certain other staged productions, such as McVicar's at ROH - though in this case the comparative simplified thematic emphasis, on the dichotomy of inward and outward beauty/ugliness, serves to render certain of the Rigoletto-Gilda scenes more emotionally impacting and therefore perhaps it is inappropriate, given the relative complexity of the themes involved in the opera, to refer to this or any other version as definitive.
However, I think this is a version that must stand up to the best of them  with the central reasons for buying this, therefore, the thematically complex versimo perspective of Rigoletto that it provides and the outstanding overall performance of Gruberova that must be the finest Gilda performance available on video.",1191542400,,4383,5.0

1183230,5,B0000042BZ,"Every Pavarotti fan should own this marvelous film version of one of Verdi's greatest operas. In addition to the strong characterization, this opera provides several outstanding arias for each of the three leading characters, as well as touching duets, and one of opera's most famous quartets. Pavarotti's youthful voice sparkles with vitality, and his acting is more than satisfactory for the libertine Duke. This is a chance to enjoy the greatest tenor voice of our generation in its prime. (Yes, Domingo has greater versatility, especially in terms of roles and languages, but it's Pavarotti's golden voice that will mark him as one of greatest tenors of all time.) In this recording, his vocal trademarks are on display, including his sweet and bright tonal quality, lyric and classic legato, pure and smooth delivery, and wonderful upper extension. Edita Gruberova, the Czechoslovakian lyric soprano, gives a touching portrayal as the innocent Gilda. In the very difficult aria, ""Caro nome,"" her coloratura trills express Gilda's ecstasy, her soft diminuendo suggests devotion, and her closing cadenza expresses her pure and radiant beauty. And she does it all while looking very relaxed. Ingvar Wixell, the Swedish baritone, sings with great strength and conviction, and his acting is outstanding. In this production, Gilda looks like she could actually be Rigoletto's daughter because they both have rather round faces. There are baritones that sing with greater warmth and sensitivity, but there are few baritones who could provide a more convincing acting performance. (If you want to hear a very warm and touching portrayal of an anxious father and devoted daughter, try the recently reissued 1950 CD recording with Leonard Warren and Erna Berger.)

Ponnelle film productions are noted for their theatrical and manneristic qualities. These characteristics can be distractive and excessive, especially in film versions, but Ponnelle applies them skillfully to dramatize the story and characters. He has appropriately employed historical locations that Verdi had in mind. He accents physical gestures that provide penetrating insights into the characters. (For example, the close-ups of the courtiers reveal their carefree and insensitive nature.) Note how Ponnelle has the camera retreat from the balcony as Gilda floats and sustains the final notes to ""Caro nome."" Even though this film was made in 1982, the picture and sound quality are outstanding. This is an excellent production and a tribute to Ponnelle and the entire cast.",1154563200,,2540,5.446700507614213
1183231,5,B0000042BZ,"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's movie of Rigoletto was my first exposure to this wonderful opera...watching it again, years later, from the perspective of a seasoned Rigoletto(and Verdi) enthusiast, it still has the power to enchant, to revolt, to surprise, to overpower, to inform and to provoke thought on the strength of its dark interpretation, its psychological approach.

Let's not mince words here. The film is a baroque, profane and utterly garish spectacle. Some may be turned off by this. I find it appropriate considering the subject matter of the opera. For instance, Verdi might not have written the opening scene as an orgy per se, due to the Italian censors, but it is easy enough to interpret it that way, and Ponnelle pulls out all the stops. More power to him. This Salo-slash-Caligula-like feast is replete with disturbing imagery: rats crawling over dinner plates; countesses celebrated as objects of beauty who actually look like ashen spectres; half-dressed musclemen utilized as submissive display pieces; pretty maidens offered up as sacrifice to the Duke of Mantua's gluttonous appetites. Ugly? Perhaps. But perfectly in step with the opera's theme of destructive depravity. Likewise, having Sparafucile made up like a grotesque caveman adds to the concept that the world Rigoletto inhabits is surreal, nightmarish, the only island of hope in this inferno rests in the small upper chamber where his daughter Gilda resides. When even that oasis is violated, it becomes grimly apparent that the hunchback's whole world has fallen apart.

In his other opera films, Ponnelle likes to emphasize parallels among characters, and Rigoletto is no exception. First, we see a moment of realization on the face of Rigoletto when Monterone is issuing his curse over his violated daughter, wherein the court jester seems to recognize that if the same thing were to happen to his own daughter he would be just as vindictive. This closeup is a revelation of humanity, but also of culpability for the multihued protagonist. Later, when Rigoletto first meets Sparafucile, they engage in a physical exchange that is choreographed to resemble a waltz, showcasing the similarities between the two characters, similarities discerned by Rigoletto himself in his ensuing monologue. Other incisive visual moments: the use of flashbacks, such as Rigoletto recalling Gilda at church, or the face of the angry count issuing his curse. In fact, the whole film is portrayed as a flashback, since it opens with Rigoletto mourning over his daughter's corpse. The medium of film affords Ponnelle the creative freedom to include these psychological touches in ways a staged production never could, and he does so successfully. For that reason alone, this film is recommended.

But let's not forget the other treasures to be savored here, primarily the performers. Pavarotti is in his vocal prime, that is all that needs to be said, I won't waste time glorifying a voice that needs no introduction. The real surprise here is his acting. He manages to turn his usually ruddy, cherubic countenance into something sinister and cannibalistic, and it's a side of the performer we rarely see onstage. The magnificent coloratura soprano Edita Gruberova is in peak form as Gilda, bringing a heightened intensity to the role but never at the expense of vocal beauty. Neither she nor Pavarotti look the part  exactly, but they make up for it through their precise vocalism and also through their ability to inhabit the bodies of their characters...I would have said inhabit their souls, but it is left in doubt whether the the duke possesses such a thing. I was unfamiliar with the baritone Ingvar Wixell, but his performance as Rigoletto is astonishing, pathetic, endearing, off-putting, fabulously sung, utilizing a voice that is both smooth and rich. I have mixed feelings about Riccardo Chailly's interpretation of the score. He plays up the bombast, the chilling loudness of certain moments, perhaps too much, although the quieter moments are certainly not lacking in nuance. Still, I prefer James Levine's interpretation on the Met DVD release. I will say this for Chailly, he gives us an uncut version of the score. I'm not a big fan of the duke's oft-excised act two cabaletta, I think it is the weakest, most hackneyed moment of this otherwise inventive score, but I would rather have it than not, and Chailly actually presents us with both verses, a rare enough event(even the Levine version is cut down to one verse).

Some viewers might find Ponnelle's ghastly, decadent vision a bit over-the-top, but isn't opera in general over-the-top, particularly Italian opera from this era? Rigoletto's story is a wall-to-wall nightmare(of his own making; you lie down with dogs, dear Rigoletto...), and it is perfectly appropriate to present it as such.",1153008000,,4827,5.183333333333334

1183234,4,B0000042BZ,"Rigoletto - Yes, the arias and recits were recorded and then added to the film.  There are some parts where the latter is evident; however, the film is a feast for the eye as the vocals are a desert to the ear.

Act I : Winer Philharmoniker under the direction of Maestro Riccardo Chailly is precise and captures the phrasing of this Verdian Opera.  The ballata is a reminder of the glory days of la voce di Pavarotti, and it brings into perspective the Italian ping that brought him the opera world at his feet.  The chorus is magnificently costumed and is a necessity in order for the opera to run smoothly.  The whole first act is a huge array of drunks, prostitutes, and food, being led by the host il Duca.  Pavarotti is not the best at acting.  In this film version, he is not that bad.  Most of the camera focuses on his face rather than on the body.. I wonder why?  Ingvar Wixell does a magnificent job at portraying the hunchback we have come to love - Rigoletto.  His singing and phrasing of the melodies is excellent.

Act II : This act focuses on the relationship between Rigoletto and his figlia Gilda.  The duet - Deh non parlate, is sung with great color and excellent phrasing.  Edita Gruberova is the perfect Gilda.  Her true lyric-coloratura voice is without a doubt a perfect match for the role that Verdi wrote.  Too many dramatic coloraturas or full lyrics sing the role of Gilda and unfortunately butcher it!  The famous aria: Caro nome, is where we come to hear the flute like tone of Ms. Gruberova.  She sings all the ornamentations that a soprano of the caliber that she possesses, in order to bring the house down.  Her trills are effortless and her range is magnificent.  Her legato is divine and her stacatti are mouth watering.

Act III: In this act, we have the aria that most legendary tenors have deemed the most difficult written by Verdi.  The issue deals with the tessitura of the aria.  It lies quite high on the register, which could lead to disaster if not properly sung.  Pavarotti does a marvelous job.  He attacks the aria with grace and uses his ""ping"" in order to stay above the notes and not below.  I am always amazed by the color of his voice, so bright and trumpet like... amazing.  I have heard recording of great tenors that have transposed the aria down a step. I have also heard recordings where by the last third of the aria, the tenor had modulated half a step.  Another great recording is Del Monaco singing the aria at La Scala during the mid 50's.  Parmi veder le lagrime is certainly difficult, but Pavarotti makes it sound easy and painless.  Amazing!!  The duet at the end of the act between Rigoletto and Gilda is heart wrenching.  Tutte le feste al tempio, written in e-minor,(a common key that Verdi uses between a father figure and his daughter), has such sorrow that it sometimes goes without notice.  Ms. Gruberova sings her heart out in this duet.  Her tone and emotional makeup have changed by this act.  She is no longer the young and nave Gilda of the act before, she is in pain and realizes that love hurts.  Great phrasing on her part and excellent singing on Mr. Wixell's part as well.

Act IV: The aria know around the world:  La donna  mobile, excellent - listen for yourself.  The quartet, perhaps the one that is the closest to perfection (next to the sextet in Il Trovatore) is sung with great technicality.  The phrasing is there at times, but it seems that too much time was taken in the recording studio.  The voices sound very rigid and manipulated.  All the notes are there but the feeling is missing.  There is nothing better than hearing this quartet live or in a CD recording ( I recommend the one with Milnes, Pavarotti, Sutherland and Bonynge conducting.  Final scene on the gondola is such a beauty to the eye.  The voice of Gilda, now disgraced in the eyes of her father and fatally wounded is such a joy to hear.  Great job!

Overall: great singing, excellent conducting, Pavarotti shines, Gruberova gives a performance that should serve as reference for sopranos today and a magnificent job done by Ingvar Wixell playing Rigoletto.  4.25 out of 5 stars.  Enjoy!!",1110240000,,4153,4.547297297297297
1183235,2,B0000042BZ,"Although this cinematic version of Verdi's Rigoletto would be considered by most movie-goers a ""B"" genre work, the music is the only somewhat decent aspect that salvages its otherwise boring and laughable attempt at truly creating a legitimate ""film.""

Luciano Pavarotti (one of the most famous tenors in the last few years to have sung the role of the Duke of Mantua), Ingar Wixell (as Rigoletto), and Edita Gruberova (as Gilda) join forces in what one would assume would be a tour de force cast.  Although Pavarotti sings the role well and easily hits the higher notes, they at times seem a bit dry (as he is prone to doing), without any type of animation or gusto.  Gruberova is an above average Gilda, and she and Pavarotti shine brightest when they are singing together (namely in their Act II duet and the famous quartet in Act III).  Wixell is a light Rigoletto, but he is clearly the most effulgent of the trio as a singing actor; were the viewer to close his or her eyes, almost no emotion or real role portrayal would be felt from anyone except for the baritone.

But alas, the disastre of this is undoubtedly the acting and final cut of the ""movie"" itself.  Some operas turned into works of cinema have worked (e.g., Tosca with Domingo and Malfitano), yet here, the acting is ridiculously overdone, or in the case of Pavarotti (which isn't too unusual for those who have seen him on stage...) is non-existent.  To top it off, the music is almost never matched with the actual movements of the actors' mouths, which results in a stereotypical effect like you would see in a dubbed foreign film.

To get to the point, this is NOT the Rigoletto to buy if you are looking for a good production.  Skip it---go with the Met production with Domingo/Cotrubas/Diaz or the Covent Garden production with Alvarez/Gavanelli/Schafer.  Either would be a much more enjoyable choice for the seasoned opera fan and the beginner alike.",1103760000,,1927,4.7253731343283585

I didn't particularly like all of the stagy, arty-farty special effects included on the DVD or the outlandish costumes or the primary school acting. But the music! Pavarotti is, as usual, fine as the Duke (I have a couple of other recordings by him in the role). But here, the others all compete with him on equal terms.

It's so easy to follow the story.
The picture is far from striking but is nonetheless acceptable, but don't expect too much from the recorded sound, albeit that it's good enough to carry the beauty of Vixwell's and Grunberova's singing.

1183239,5,B0000042BZ,"I usually do not care for ""movie"" versions of opera, preferring a filmed live performance, but this one is most enjoyable, and has some standout performances.
Released in 1983, it was made on location in Mantua, with good cinematography in a pallete of browns and dark greys.
Pavarotti is the Duke of Mantua, looking strong and robust, but I must confess I thought his performance very one-dimensional, continually loud, and as an actor is much the weakest in the cast.
Edita Gruberova's Gilda is extremely interesting; she gets stronger in each scene, and I found her performance to be quite touching and wonderful. Her ""Caro Nome"" is one that I truly loved, full of sweetness and vulnerability, and delicate trills.
Ingvar Wixell's Rigoletto is superb, brilliantly portraying the many sides of the hunchbacked jester, from maliciously plotting revenge, to tenderly loving his daughter and the memory of his wife. His voice is rich and full, and he makes the most of Verdi's gorgeous score.
Victoria Vergara is a stunning and seductive Maddalena, and Ferruccio Fulanetto's Sparafucile is a creepy villain with very scary jagged teeth, and both are in fine vocal form.
Riccardo Chailly conducts the Vienna Choir and Philharmonic with great pacing, and this is a Rigoletto well worth watching, even for those who like me, are not ""movie"" opera fans.",1054857600,,1348,5.076576576576577

The cast is perfect, at least when it comes to singing, but I just can't stop LAUGHING at Edita Gruberova's infernal gestures and behaviour... Maybe Gilda is supposed to be a bit stupid and naive, but Gruberova's playing is almost parodic.
  But it's not any worse than that it makes you laugh.
I have no complains to the rest of the movie. Wixell is just as good as an actor as a singer, and I don't think Pavarotti acts too bad either. But anyway, you forget his bad acting when you can hear him sing!",1050710400,,594,4.342342342342342
1183241,4,B0000042BZ,"This is a dynamic and exciting show with the leads at the top of their game.
  Rigoletto has never been more convincingly acted than in the hands of Ingvar Wixell.  His voice is powerful and fulll of different colors to enjoy throuought the opera.  His g# at the end of the 2nd act is extremely impressive.  He radiates internal struggle and pain and earns his stars as not only a great baritone but a great actor.
  Gilda gets a wonderful treatment by Gruderova, who can sing a pianissimo as well as you can hear.  Her joy and pain is clearly visible throughout and she really does portray well the confused, miserable creature that Gilda becomes quite well.  unlike pavarotti, she takes very few liberties from the score and sings within it well.
  Pavarotti sounds great.  This is the kind of role that is made for his voice.  His duke is beautifully sounded in his mature but lyric voice. This is the kind of spinto singing that makes pavarotti one of the greatest tenors of all time. His acting, while entertaining, is unconvincing.  He has a disturbing habit of never blinking his eyes during Aria's which can bug the viewer.
  Overall this is a absolutley fabulous entertainment experience.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the lip synching.  I think it takes away from the opera experience to have it recorded and dubbed into the scene.  The singers expression and the excitement of the opera is increased when it is live.  I think, however, it is a worthwhile buy for opera and non-opera fans alike. The story and presentation is wonderful and the singing doubly so.",1049500800,,1580,4.635379061371841
1183242,5,B0000042BZ,"Okay, first off, it's a FILM version of the opera, so one can't quite judge it by the standards of a recorded live opera.  After being a devoted opera fan for over 20 years, I need to mention that ANYONE, not only ""newbies"" will enjoy it.  What I immediately noticed was the fact that the opera score is here without omissions, a problem that haunts many attempts of making a good opera film.  ""Otello"" or ""La Traviata"", for instance, are superbly staged, but they suffer from many scene omissions, which can be upsetting to the fans.  Not the case here, at least I could not find any without having to retrieve my copy of the score and compare it line by line.
The absolute revelation for me was Mr. Ingwar Wixell.  I've heard his voice many times, particularly on early Verdi recordings brought to life by Lamberto Gardelli.  Well, here he sounds even better, plus he proves himself as one of the best singing actors I've ever seen.  At the first scene at Duke's palace, Rigoletto is plain disgusting, no wonder Monterone curses him.  By the way, Monterone is played by Wixell as well, and I was surprised by the sonority and great low register that his baritone is able to produce.  Later, he's a obsessively loving father and a mischievous ""vendicator"".  Loved Feruccio Furlanetto's Sparafucile!  I could not believe it was him under all that makeup, but the pitch-black quality of his voice is unmistakable.  Edita Gruberova has long been one of the world's leading high coloratura sopranos.  Indeed, to be able to accurately negotiate Gilda's tessitura, one needs a spectacular high range.  Sutherland also had that kind of high register, but Gruberova was a better choice cinematically, I suppose.  Still, I wished for a subtler portrait of Gilda, but it had to do.  Pavarotti's Duke is why, of course, most folks will buy this DVD.  Well, he definitely gives a dashing Duke.  He sings up a storm on a soundtrack (including the impossible high-flying ending of ""possente amor"") and a tongue-in-cheek ""la donna e mobile"", his signature aria.  He overplays a bit, but he's a lot of fun to watch.  Since he does not have to sing and move at the same time, he really bounces around quite a bit and looks very much at home throughout.
The film depicted the court of the Duke in the most accurate way.  They're quite like vultures, and appropriately dressed in black.  Marullo is sang by none other than Bernd Weikl, but played (wonderfully) by an actor.  Even Giovanna is cast luxuriously - it's Fedora Barbieri who does not only provide a great voice, but also some much-needed comic relief in this fairly dark opera based on Hugo's ""The King Amuses Himself"".  Riccardo Chailly conducts with gusto, but also with proper sensitivity.
Overall, it's a well thought-out film, I could not think of a way of making it any better.  Even the often messed-up abduction scene is quite believable here.  The subtitles are not bad, and the picture on DVD is a LOT better than on VHS or LaserDisc.",1043712000,,2987,4.718146718146718
1183243,2,B0000042BZ,"I showed this at my opera club, and only the newbie was happy with it.  Yes, the sets are gorgeous and evocative, and the singing was very good.  But this DVD suffers from the choice of the director to do so many closeups.  Pavarotti's voice can still make you want to close your eyes in ecstasy -- but he plays a blustery, overbearing Duke, making it hard to see why Gilda falls for him.  (There's already precious little in the libretto to make the Duke sympathetic, and Pavarotti doesn't use what's there.)  He has a disconcerting way of opening his eyes VERY wide and not blinking.  It would be easier for the viewer to maintain an illusion of young lovers if the camera were moved back a bit from *both* romantic leads...  Gruberova's voice is accurate, but after hearing the rich, plush young tone of Desiree Rancatore in the recent San Francisco Opera production, it's just not the same.  Overall, well sung and well set, but ultimately unsatisfying.",1040774400,,957,4.654761904761905
1183244,5,B0000042BZ,"I liked this DVD from beginning to end !
This is the movie version of Verdi's tragic masterpiece Rigoletto. I must admit, that up to this point, I had not been a big fan of operas that had been made into movies: but I have to make an exception in this instance. Filmed in Italy by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, the settings consist of real castles, streets and rivers that lend a sublime atmosphere and ambience to the opera being presented here. It would be impossible for a stage version to present such elaborate surroundings. The costumes, throughout, are nothing short of sumptuous and fit perfectly into the era they were intended to represent. The camera angles were well placed with the only negative comment being that some of the facial shots were ultra closeup.
This work stars Ingvar Wixell (Rigoletto), Luciano Pavarotti (Duke of Mantova) and Edita Gruberova (Gilda).
 Luciano Pavarotti is in his singing prime in this production and his acting, although not great, is passable. Gruberova has a great voice and does justice to her part as Gilda. It is however Ingvar Wixell that commands the audiences' attention with his fabulous interpretation of the tragic hero, Rigoletto. His performance, in my opinion, is worthy of acting honors and his singing voice is as impressive as his stage presence throughout the entire work. He simply carries the show from beginning to end.
I was much more impressed with this performance than I thought I would be and could highly recommended it without any reservations: A Rigoletto you will be happy to own.",1040774400,,1549,4.912213740458015
1183245,5,B0000042BZ,"This outstanding production of one of the greatest operas ever written is a fantastic way to introduce yourself (or someone you know) to opera for the first time, as well as a production that more experienced opera fans will cherish. The story and music are perfect, the acting and singing superb and the cinematography is excellent. This production grabs you from the beginning and never lets up. Don't pass up this DVD!

Although the cover features a photo of Pavarotti as the lecherous Duke of Mantua, this production belongs to Ingmar Wixill, the real star, who simply shines as Rigoletto. He is a superb actor and manages to convey all the complexity of personality that the character of the hunchbacked Jester demands.  You will in turn despise him, pity him, and ultimately empathize with him as the tragedy unfolds. Other reviews have criticized him for not being a strong enough singer to pull off the role convincingly. I disagree completely with this. When he cries out ""Mia Fillia!"" (my daughter!) in despair it will send chills down your spine. The coarse, complex character of Rigoletto should not be sung by a honey voiced baritone anyway. Watching and listening to Wixill sing the aria ""Cortigiani, vil razza"" still gives me goosebumps after many viewings.

Pavarotti is of course superb in the role of the Duke, acting fickle and singing his famous arias. ""Questo o quella"" and ""La Donna e Mobile"" are from this opera and he is in top form. What others have called his ""mugging"" for the camera to me portrayed very well his fickle nature; because you don't see it often it doesn't strike me as overdone. Pavarotti's real gift is not his acting but his voice (of course) and I unequivically add that his use of language or diction is distinctive and outstanding. If you listen carefully to the way he colors particular words and phrases to add meaning as he sings them you will come to appreciate him all the more.

I must confess that the first time I saw this production I disliked Gruberova as Gilda in  the first act. Gilda seemed to me to be an airhead, and although Gruberova's voice is beautiful, she didn't seem to know what to do with her hands and didn't add any depth to the character. That changes as the story unfolds, however, and Gruberova's Gilda develops more complexity. All of the characters in this production are complex, but Gruberova seems to develop her character the most over the course of the production. When she  sings the word ""anguish!"" during ""tutte le feste al tempio"" as she tells her father about how she met the duke, I am totally with her in that anguish. Then, when held in her father's arms again, she is a frightened little girl. I am convinced she is perfect as Gilda in the quartet that comes near the end of the opera.
The other characters are excellent as well. Maddalena is voluptuous, and Sparafucile the assasin repulsive (but perhaps has more honor than all the rest!)
It is pointless to me to compare a film to a staged production. The film maker has different skills to bring to bear than does the director of a stage production. Camera angles become formost rather than placement of the characters on the stage. I personally like the way the focus changes in the film and the way the cinematography matches the mood of the music. But nothing will take the place of a real opera production on stage.
I highly recommend this production. Enjoy it for what it is and you will treasure it.",1036972800,,3451,4.677100494233938

What can I say? I run on my lunch time to home (I work next to home), for only reason to watch again ""Bella filia del amore"" and Rigolleto's song!!!!
I even can't say that somebody here is better! All are better! I thing it is really pearl in opera's history.
If someone will capture like this in the future? First thing I will disagree with some cameraman who cut out Wixel's hands during his highly emotional song. As well in the same area, later they cut out heads of duke's court people. In the ""bella filia"" Pavarotti face is out of focus for Gilda's emotions, but Pavarotti's face at the moment is reach by emotions as well: both of them should appear sharp in my opinion.

1183251,5,B0000042BZ,"This is just about as good a production of Verdi's masterpiece as you will get.  Of course, no production is absolutely perfect as it is only one persons vision of a piece - we all have our own individual ideas of how we would like it done.
I would never, for example, have allowed Rigoletto to take his young daughter out into the wilderness surrounding Mantua in the middle of the night, during a manic storm, wearing only a nightdress!  What was he thinking of by then sending her home unaccompanied (where incidentally only the night before he had run into a professional assassin) whilst he went and sat on his own in  a boat in the middle of a lake!!  Then how on earth he could mistake his daughter's body in the sack for one the size of The Duke of Mantua pales beyond belief .... but no matter, the merits of this production far outweigh the weaknesses.
Although for the first time, with such brilliantly authentic surroundings and acting, I began to question the plausibilty of it all.  I think this is because as it unfolds on your TV screen in such sharp clarity of picture and sound it makes you start to analsye it more.  So that is a major plus for this disc to start with.
Ingvar Wixell acts the central role with such committment and power that you never doubt for one moment that he is indeed a tortured soul with two separate lives.  His shame at being uncovered as acourt jester as his daughter realises her own shame at being raped is just one of the many poignant and powerful moments in this excellent DVD.  He is partnered wonderfully by Edita Gruberova, who I suspect has studied the great Renato Scotto's interpretation of Gilda.  Just lap it all up - these are amazing performances.
Sparafucile is perfectly sung and portrayed by a very young Ferruccio Furlanetto - and Victoria Vergara is as good as any Maddalena you are ever likely to come across in the opera house.  Orchestration is superb and with a few quibbles it is directed brilliantly by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle.

Gruberova sings very well, excellent in ""Caro nome"". But the surprise is Wixell: not a great voice like Bastianini or Warren, but what an actor!

1183257,5,B0000042BZ,"Watching this film-opera of ""Rigoletto"" gets you the confidence of saying that ""Rigoletto"" indeed is the best opera ever written. Why? Simply, because, this movie gives you the correct  idea, how deep, dramatic and full of action the story of ""Rigoletto"" really is. This is the best story ever set to music. This is wellknown fact, but this film gives you more. You simply can not skip any single detail because everything is so obviously and perfectly done. Begining from the prelude and magnificent first act. What a staging. I am really stunned! And the fourth act where drama comes to its conclusion. I think the most amazing about this film is, how redicolous could it sound, acting of Sparafucile, murderer. I knew that Feruccio Furlanetto was great singer but he turned out to be the great actor too. He is so ugly, dirty, dressed in terribly worn clothes and at the same time so real. Second amazing thing is Pavarotti's singing. First time in my life I really have a doubt, that maybe he is better Duce then Alfredo Kraus (but still, I don't think so). Edita Gruberova is excellent Gilda. Her singing is so free, so beautifull, reminding sometimes legendary Renata Scotto. Now Rigoletto - Ingvar is great, but of course not the best Rigoletto. The best is Bastianini. However, as the actor, Ingvar fits the role to perfection, and finally I have to mentioned the outstanding performance from Viena Orchestra and Chorus. Orchestra sounds so perfect. So finally, I want to say that I hate modern productions of an old operas, this is not correct. Opera should be staged as it was originally thought. And this movie gives us idea how  exactly  ""Rigoletto"" is supposed to be staged. So my suggestion is: get this video, this is must have. Maybe the best film-opera ever made.",979171200,,1780,4.7727272727272725
1183258,5,B0000042BZ,"This is an excellent performance of Verdi's ""Rigoletto"" based  upon Vicor Hugo's ""L'Roi S'Amuse (The King Amuses Himself) and is one  of his finest operas. From start of finish this is a masterpiece. All the  singers are well-polished and highly convincing. Ingvar Wixell's portrayal  of the deformed court jester Rigoletto (renamed from Hugo's  ""Triboletto"") in the court of Mantua was the best that I have  ever seen. Pavarotti, who plays the Duke himself, is in top form as always  (although such a pudgy Don Juan may seem slightly out-of-place, his acting  is superb), and Edita Gruberova does as astounding job as Gilda,  Rigoletto's daughter. The settings look genuine, the music is excellent and  Wixell truly manages to capture the pain and humiliation of a man forced  into being a fool by his deformities and social position. The history of  the opera makes for an interesting study in censorship as well. Hugo  himself preferred this opera to his own story that it was based on! The  quartet at the end is partuclalry memorable and the murderer was so scuzzy  and grungy looking that he was almost comical, although his deep bass was  beautiful. Finely acted, visually appealing and great music. What more  could one ask for?",960249600,,1236,4.951219512195122
1183259,5,B0000042BZ,"This version of Rigoletto was wonderful-the music of course, and the performances. Pavarotti is in great voice. The movie-like staging for the most part is good. This is not a recorded stage version; it is a filmed  version especially for the video.",944438400,,249,4.928571428571429
7903238,5,B0000042BZ,Love the production and of course the wonderful voices! My absolute favorite opera! Pavarotti is the quintessential bad boy duke and Edita Gruberova had a crystal clear voice as Gilda. But of course Ingvar Wixell was wonderful as Rigoletto!,1520640000,,240,5.17948717948718
7903239,5,B0000042BZ,"Great aspects:
- Pavarotti shines on film; he is pure charm all the time and it's completely understandable why a Gilda could fall for his Duke. Despite being synced, he does some pretty incredible singing.
- Wixell as Rigoletto is absolutely captivating as singer and actor.  His 'Corteggiani' goes through increasing layers of desperation and heartbreak.
- Amazing set design by Quaranta. Makes me wish I could have seen the theatrical version from the 70's to see how much Ponnelle added to the film version.

Not as great aspects:
- Overture kind of spoils the ending... Primes the tone, but ruins the surprise for newbies.
- Gruberova's Gilda doesn't sit with me quite right. Her mezze di voce get to be a little tiresome by act two, regardless of the impressive vocal control.",1515888000,,782,4.87218045112782

Imagination does not include Pavarotti as the great seducer he is supposed to interprete but one must admit he is  great talent. Thanks a lot for provide this dvd!
