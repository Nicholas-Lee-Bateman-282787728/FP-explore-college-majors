8461272,4,B00585GYH0,"Overall, this was a pretty good shoot. You get to hear how Ted first broke into the biz, and how he couldn't even use the Hart name for a while, you get to hear about what happened between him and CM Punk. Teddy also discusses the Infamous ROH cage incident. There's also another Teddy Hart shoot called ""A Hart Still Pounding"", which was better than this one. The only real downside to this shoot is some glitches and a scene where some Terry Funk Shoot gets spliced in.",1355011200,,471,4.363636363636363
