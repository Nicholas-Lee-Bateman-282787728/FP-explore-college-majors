7874406,3,6304481098,"I was not expectin a heck of a lot from the DVD so I wasn't too dissapointed. I just thought it was a little bargain basement quality. I sold mine because my daughter didn't like it either. I try to be open minded and to let my kids decide what THEY like before i give my opinion. This was not that great. I am sure some love it but for ME, i wished i had not wasted me money on it.",998438400,,382,3.728395061728395
7874407,5,6304481098,"I think this is a really, really cute movie!  My five year old daughter just loves it.  The animation is adorable, the colors are bright and eye-catching, and the story is easy enough for even a 3 or 4 year old to  follow, without getting bored! In addition, there are some cute, catchy  songs included, which my daughter just loves to sing along to! (Of course,  my daughter is a cat-lover, so she was easily won over). So, if you're in  the market for charming, entertaining, and funny stories with happy endings  for your child, then a Tale Of Two Kitties will make the PURRRRRFECT  addition to your ""kid movie collection""!",949190400,,626,4.576576576576577
