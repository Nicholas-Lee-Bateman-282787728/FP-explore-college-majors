1843074,5,B00008G76O,"This DVD is very similar to Rodney Yee's latest Power Yoga DVD.  The big differences are inversions and slightly more difficult seated poses.  The average person with 2+ years of experience would benefit from this DVD (I suggest 2 plus years, but a person could get plenty of benfit out of this DVD by modifying a few poses with less experience too).  The inversions are performed against a wall, but can be performed out in the open if you have good proficency with forearm balance and headstand poses.  The flow is smooth and depends upon the style of yoga you come from as to whether you would consider it fast or slow.  If your background is based in ashtanga, then you would probably consider the flow as kind of slow to moderate, if you have more of an iyengar (or any yoga style where a long period of time is spent in a given pose) backgound then the pace may be a little quicker than what you may be used to.  Personally, I think the flow is good giving some time to get into poses and start to feel the stretch, but the flow keeps the heat going.  This DVD is about 65 minutes long and is good if you are working your way to hour plus yoga sessions.  Overall, this is another great Yee production, and as I've stated in previous reviews, Yee hasn't let me down yet.",1104451200,143,1275,4.305439330543933

1843102,5,B00008G76O,"I have never used another yoga video and I don't think I ever will.  I absolutely love this video.  There are a number of poses that I just simply cannot do, as well as the fact that the entire video would take much longer than I would like to spend, so I have modified it by doing some poses and taking out others.  I have chronic back pain and I discovered that by doing this yoga, I can 100% ""cure"" my back pain for a number of days.  Once I start to feel the pain come back, I know I need to do my yoga very very soon.  The music he uses  is the most relaxing sound I have ever heard in my life, and I feel like I am going into a completely different world of relaxation every time I start the dvd.

Even though it has some same poses, they are done in a different way, in different order, or speed. The first part is a bit too fast to my like, but after the first 5 minutes it is getting better, poses being held longer.

1843109,5,B00008G76O,What can I say it is Rodney Yee. He definitely takes it up a notch on this video. It is good for anyone who is looking to advance their yoga practice.

1843146,5,B00008G76O,"I love this DVD! I will warn you parts of it were too hard until I merged it with what I learned from qualified instructors at a studio.  Once you learn them, it's a great way to practice intermediate poses at home. It gives that extra modification to take it up a notch  that typical DVDs don't provide, but you by no means need to be an expert. It has great twists and bends.  There is a section with inversions - head and handstand, etc.  I skipped that section until an instructor showed me how and I had practiced in a studio and built up my confidence. I still won't do the bridge or forearm stand without support.  I just ff past those for now. It is a great total body workout that is healing and stress reducing too.  You will definitely build strength.",1404950400,,762,4.256944444444445

Although it is not instructional, watching it and pausing it allows you the time and space to master some of the more difficult moves.  He also has enough beginning flow moves in the mix that you don't feel overwhelmed.  If you are new to Yoga or don't have much experience in a studio this will be too hard for you...but if you have been doing yoga and are ready for new things; this is a good intro session.  There are handstands and headstands in the mix; so if you haven't done these before it is probably best to practice them in the studio or have someone around to spot you.",1402272000,6,637,4.336134453781512

Not yoga cheesy either.  I keep the yoga DVDs and a travel mat in my carry-on at all times.  Very happy with the purchase.

BTW- the hotels have been great at accommodating my request for ""room to do yoga"".  I just ask at the front desk when I check in and if the hotel is not at or near capacity, the staff is usually great at making it happen.",1388275200,2,662,4.232

Once I ""maxed out"" the beginner and even some intermediate instruction readily available on TV and on demand, I found this video and was challenged as if I were new to yoga! Rodney Yee doesn't waste time explaining the base positions learned early in a yoga education, but moves through them quickly and spends the time explaining the new inverted positions. This video is difficult and inspiring!",1302739200,,429,4.733333333333333
1843255,5,B00008G76O,Rodney Yee's Intermediate Yoga is an excellent follow-on to his beginner DVD.  The poses are challenging but very do-able to the experienced practitioner.  For me the most challenging poses are the handstands (done against a wall).,1301184000,,231,5.388888888888889
1843256,5,B00008G76O,"This is a great workout if you are looking for a more intermediate level challenge.  I really like it because it gives me something different from the beginners' yoga moves, but still incorporates the basics.  So while it gives me a new program to follow, it's not completely unfamiliary.  It's a little faster paced and the poses are more difficult, which is exactly what I needed after doing beginners' yoga workouts over the last two years.",1299628800,,443,4.802631578947368
1843292,5,B00008G76O,"Despite my natural flexibility and over 20 years of regular practice, this DVD demanded better grounding and greater strength than I had cultivated to that point.  Yee's reminders about  ""relaxed face"", ""relaxed throat"", illustrated the need to develp the strength  it takes to relax into a demanding posture rather than simply abusing my flexibility.
I've used this DVD daily over long periods and keep discovering nuances in the instruction that deepen my own practice. Yee is astoundingly thorough and accurate, as I've come to appreciate.
I don't always do each asana in each sequence and sometimes substitute a more advanced asana for one on the DVD--and when I do, I wish I had Rodney narrating the posture, just to see what I could pick up from him.",1299196800,,756,4.937007874015748

It's a great variety: standing poses (lots of triangle), inverted poses (handstand, headstand, and arm balance), backbends, and other flexibility. If you'd like something of the intermediate level and plenty of time to practice inverted postures, this is a great sequence. The inversion section is fairly long and he coaches you through it. I recently got rid of my VCR, so I was happy to find that my old ""Yoga for Intermediates"" was available on DVD under a different name.",1270166400,,542,4.967032967032967

1843295,5,B00008G76O,"This particular program worked for me so well when I had it in the tape version that I bought a second one when I wore that one out. Then I got another in the new version.

I prefer a slower approach, not just one sun salute after another. I prefer separate poses because they help me to be more flexible. It will never be possible or even necessary for me to do everything on this practice, but that's okay. It's still my favorite and nothing Rodney Yee has done since has improved on it for my purposes.",1266278400,,505,4.206185567010309
1843296,3,B00008G76O,"This is a nice starter DVD at this level, but I wish it incorporated the inversions into the flow.  Rodney Yee is (in my opinion) one of the best Yoga via DVD instructors.  I highly recommend any of his DVD's for those who want to practice at home.  He is extremely technical, but calm, and soothing.  If you want to to real yoga (not hot)and build some actual strength to enhance your flexibility, Rodney is a great starting point.  In addition, as an advanced yoga student, I pop in some of his lower level DVDs.  They still give a great workout and he gives wonderful reminders of the basics of alignment.  If only Rodney and Jason Crandell came out with a workout together.  That would be heaven.  ps...the advanced DVD set is GREAT!",1265932800,4,737,4.481203007518797
1843297,5,B00008G76O,"I have been using INTERMEDIATE YOGA as a regular part of my exercise routine for several years now (without getting bored of it) and for that reason alone would recommend it.

Filmed outside in Maui Hawaii this is a great 1 hour practice for those looking for a bit of a challenge. If you have some experience then all the poses are familiar here just done with more detail and accuracy.  And in all honesty the only parts that I consider intermediate would be the head and shoulder stands sections.  As usual Rodney Yee's voice instruction is impeccable and there is a nice calm, even flow to the sequence of postures.

Beginning with as short interview Rodney explains the DVD we then start with Sun Salutations (which move quite quickly) transitioning into detailed Standing Poses (including some balancing moves; Warrior3 & Half Moon) then Inverted Poses (done against a wall) Backbends (Bridge, Upward Bow, Camel) Twists and Hip Openers (very good section) Shoulder Stands (with strap) and finally a short but nice relaxation.

Sometimes when I'm not feeling `intermediate' or need a shorter workout I just do the Sun Salutations & Hip Opening section. These are my favourite parts and a great workout in itself. Although there isn't a chapter menu, the practice is broken into 8 separate sections, so you can easily skip around as needed.

Props needed; Mat, block, strap, blanket and a wall. Namaste.

However, I have to tell ya, this dvd is not much different than his power yoga dvd... The major difference being the inversions. As a yoga teacher myself, If I were to teach an intermediate level class I would do more inversions. Either way, this is an excellent dvd to use for any level, but if you're looking to be challenged and you have over 3 years experience you might want more...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1220745600,19,685,5.596153846153846

1843300,5,B00008G76O,"I started up the DVD to watch first, just to see what I was getting into with an intermediate level of Rodney Yee. I was pleased to see that none of the poses are unexpected or out of reach for beginning intermediates - we should all be able to do half moons, upward bows, bridges and shoulderstands, and be working on our headstands, elbowstands and handstands.

Then I tried it out for myself:

*Vinyasa*
This first section starts with sun salutes and then keeps up a very steady vinyasa clip, with jump backs from standing forward bend into plank and some harder variations on the basic yoga poses. Upward dog is featured a lot. There are some tough transitions like half moon pose to triangle. This section is both exhausting and invigorating. Even Rodney looks tired at the end - he's shaking by warrior 3 and the vein on his glistening forehead is throbbing. If he is sweating and shaking, I feel okay about taking child's pose when I need it. :)

This is the longest section on the program and it's a real kick in the pants that it's the first one.

*Inversions*
Handstand, elbow stand, headstand - all against a wall, in what looks like the outdoor lobby of a Maui resort hotel. Rodney offers some useful preps to the poses and makes coming out of them look easy. Hand, head and elbow stands are the only inversions offered - no serious strength-related arm balances, no crows, no scorpions.

This is the shortest segment on the DVD, and I think the most fun. His lead-in to elbow stand uses a brick and a strap, and the headstand uses a brick.

*Integration*
This is focused pose work - full supported bridge (leg up), camel, upward bow. Various sitting stretches and then plow to shoulderstand. Followed by some nice twisty stretches and restorative work.

This ends with a seated meditation to a gorgeous Hawaiian sunset.

The DVD plays one hour and five minutes, and it's really all about the yoga. Rodney's introduction is a few minutes and then he wastes no time hopping (literally) into the sections. The Maui setting is nice - Rodney does his work directly on the green grass of a garden setting overlooking an ocean cliff.

My advice to beginning intermediates is to start with the Integration section, then do Inversions, and lastly do the ""power"" section that leads off the DVD. If you enjoy yoga for the sweat, then by all means perform your practice in the order the DVD suggests. :)",1216252800,33,2404,4.611241217798595

His instruction is very good and helps make sure you use and maintain proper form.

I really enjoyed this workout! The hour went by very quickly--I hardly noticed the time like I do with some workouts...

If you are used to Ashtanga Yoga (which I am), you will find this a little slow and you may wonder if you got a workout--but you do! You will hold the poses much longer than you are used to and gain muscular endurance.

The workout starts with Sun Salutations, then Inversions and ends with some flexibility moves, backbends, plow and shoulder stands. The only thing I thought it was missing was abdominal work--like many of Yee's workouts.

All in all, this is a nice workout that will leave feeling really good at the end (I had that yoga glow--another reviewer said he didn't).  Other nice intermediate level workouts are Yogatopia, Yoga Radiance (my favorite), and Rainbeau Mars Pure Power.",1199664000,6,1099,4.7631578947368425

You don't hold it so long you get bored, but enough to really be aware & fix little things before pulling back out. The first 30 min the pose flow very nicely into each other, no separation.
It starts with sun salutations w/chair & warrior 1 for a short time which aren't done again after the standing poses. Side angles, triangles turns into half moons, warrior 1 turns into warrior 3, prayer hands behind you for front leg standing stretch, 3 different kinds of standing forward bends & more.
Inversions: handstand, shoulder stand & headstand using a wall w/standing fwd bend, child's pose & downward dog in between for rest.
Integration: bridge, bow, camel, half wheel/upward bow, laying down single leg stretch, laying down figure 4, laying down knee to chest spinal twist, rocking on spine, half lotus twist arm sitting spinal twist (never seen in any other yoga dvd), sitting half lotus spinal twist (never seen before), plow & shoulder stand w/o wall, double leg sitting fwd bend, ends in 4 min meditation.

At 67 I am limited in how far I can go but this DVD is an excellent way of getting ""deeper"" into the practice of this Yoga.  I know my limits...but Rodney Yee inspires us all to more.",1168300800,2,255,3.792452830188679
1843337,4,B00008G76O,"This is the practice that moved me to the next level in Yoga.  While the beginning flow is not as smooth as other Rodney Yee's, the instruction for headstands and shoulderstands is very good.  I like to do this DVD when I want a comprehensive practice with a little of everything.",1162857600,7,280,4.470588235294118
1843338,4,B00008G76O,"I've been doing Yoga for 9 years every day and I have about 100 Yoga programs between VHS/DVD/CD and many are Rodney's.

 I've had this Rodney Yee Intermediate Program on VHS for years (I don't have it on DVD) and rarely do it. For some reason I decided to pull it off the shelf this morning and give it a go since it had been so long. I can see after doing it why it's not one I tend to reach for. It's not bad, it's just not one that works well for me, I don't have that great inner Yoga ""glow"" in terms of how I feel compared to the way I feel from the programs I really love.

This program starts w/ just a short Sun Salute section which I feel could have been a bit longer. Then there is a very good selection of standing/balancing poses.

The next series are inversions, Handstands, and forearm balances which I passed on this morning. While I can barely do those to begin with, I especially don't like the placement in the program of those types of asana and feel they'd be better placed towards the end. It really interrupted the flow and I'd prefer to go straight into the backbends after all the standing poses. Once again, that's just a personal preference.

The backbend section was very good by the way and there are some hip openers as well.

Overall, this program leaves me feeling very ""eh"" compared to his other programs (particularly his Power Yoga Stamina, and his Flexibility program) which really create an amazing feeling due to the sequencing and flow of those practices. His ""Energy"" program is another one I like better than this Intermediate program as well.

In spite of my personal reservations about this program, I still gave it  4 stars, because even though it wasn't a great program for me, it is still (aside from the placement of the inversion section) a decent enough program and I don't think a review should just be based on personal preference, but rather on a more objective perspective.

 Still, In my opinion, The following programs are all that I feel are better overall than this ""Intermediate"" Program:

Rodney's Power yoga Programs (""Stamina"", ""Flexibility"" and ""Strength"")

Baron Baptiste's excellent Power Yoga (""Journey Into Power"" levels 1 and 2, ""Soul Of Strength"", ""Power and Precision"", ""Unlocking Athletic Power"", ""Core Power"", ""Hot Yoga, The Initial Challenge"", ""Hot Yoga"" The Next Challenge"" are ALL excellent)

Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Programs

Sherrie Baptiste (sister of Baron Baptiste who has also been doing Yoga since she was a child) ""Baptiste Power Of Yoga""

Kathy Smith's New Yoga (""Intermediate"" as well as her ""Advanced"" Programs)

Total Yoga ""Water"", ""Original"" (Fire is also great also but a bit more advanced)

Shiva Rea ""Yoga Shakti""

Janis Safell ""Beverly Hills Yoga""

Rainbeau Mars ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat""",1141776000,340,2783,4.748440748440748
1843339,2,B00008G76O,"Could have been better. Now that i am definitely in need of advanced, leave alone intermediate, it was a disappointment. It gave only a couple of very basic inverted poses and that is all. I wish for a more advanced program with advanced versions of all poses and inverted poses.",1140739200,7,279,4.6

You need to know how to do all of the poses before using this--Rodney is not going to slow down for you or teach you how to properly doing everything he is moving through rather quickly.  I was disappointed because I have several beginner's DVDs, including ones from Gaiam, that generally only slowly use introductory/easy poses, and so now am looking for the same slow and careful guidance easing into the more advanced poses and flows.  Where is the DVD that properly, slowly explains how to do all of the poses Rodney flies through in this 'intermediate' yoga DVD?",1495497600,2,630,4.709090909090909
