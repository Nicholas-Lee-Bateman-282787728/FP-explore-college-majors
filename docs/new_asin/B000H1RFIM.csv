2625500,2,B000H1RFIM,"Its not for me... If your not physically fit and you really don't anything about kickBoxing, its very difficult to learn from this DVD. I tried it a fw times, but she just goes too fast and its impossible to keep up with her, the moves are not the easy and you would really have to learn them over a period of time before you can master them. I am not that out of shape, either. I did a whole year at a gym last year and lost over 15 pounds, had a knee injury that sidelined me and now tring to get back to where I was... this is not the answer...",1384387200,,547,3.849557522123894

2625503,5,B000H1RFIM,I bought this video about 5 years ago the first time I used it I use it for four months a sensible diet at 1400 calories and I actually lost over 40 pounds and I went from a size 18 all the way down a size 8. I also got her other video kick boxing bootcamp it has 5 10 minute workouts and it works very well.,1365638400,,308,3.611940298507463
2625504,4,B000H1RFIM,"If you don't have a gym nearby, this kickboxing DVD is worthwhile. The instructor, Kelly Roberts, explains and demonstrates basic and advanced kickboxing moves. Beginners to advanced kickboxers may find this DVD quite a good challenge. I tried the moves on a carpet the first time, but found it to be more useful if you do the moves on a hardwood floor. Having an intermediate level yoga background has helped me to hold many of the poses and moves much more effectively while doing this workout routine. It's a really good quality 40 minute workout that will leave you feeling like you burned some stress, calories, and fat. A bonus is that there is a separate 10 basic moves tutorial for beginners to get you started.
Bottom line: get this DVD if you want to try kickboxing or to maintain a high charged, fast moving, fat burning workout at home.",1365292800,,848,4.66

2625510,1,B000H1RFIM,Before purchasing this product I looked at the reviews on this item and the reviews stated it was a good dvd for beginners.  For the last 6 months I had been wanting to purchase a kickboxing workout for beginners and I was excited to find one. After receiving this DVD I tried the workout for several weeks and found out this DVD is very fast paced and the instruction and cueing of move changes is poorly done by Keli Roberts.  The only thing I found good about this DVD is that I only paid $8.00 for it. I was very disappointed in this product.,1354320000,,546,4.240384615384615

2625515,5,B000H1RFIM,I love this video. They say it burns about 600 calories. 900 if you really put all of your effort into it and do the tutorial video. It works out my whole body and it great to alternate with yoga. It keeps you going. I try to do it about twice a month. She says to do it 3 times a week but this is a killer workout and so upbeat!,1350950400,,329,3.647887323943662
2625516,3,B000H1RFIM,"This CD is more confusing than anything. I was not able to burn fat.
I bought a CD with Jillian Michaels ""Kickbox fastfix"" and that really works. In less than a month I look like those girls in the CD.",1347580800,,201,4.05

2625518,5,B000H1RFIM,I never did kick boxing before & now have a new love. It's a great calorie burner & stress reliever looking into more kick boxing tapes /classes right now!,1341360000,,155,4.379310344827586
2625519,5,B000H1RFIM,"I bought this dvd a few months ago, because I saw it listed on fitness magazine's list of best workout dvds. I was looking for a dvd that would burn a lot of calories, and this one (they say) will burn up to 700 calories. I am already a big fan of the Dummies books, having learned how to sail as a surprise for my then boyfriend (now husband)since he used to sail competitively.

The dvd has in introductory tutorial section that teaches how to do all the kickboxing moves that will be used in the actual workout part of the video. The actual workout is separated into warmup, part 1, part 2, part 3 and cool-down. I started by doing the tutorial then warmup, part 1 and cool-down for about two weeks and then dropped the tutorial section, feeling comfortable with the moves, and adding part 2. Then I added part 3 about a week later.

She is very good at starting with one small section and then repeating, adding on, repeating, etc. It's VERY easy to get comfortable kickboxing and feeling like a pro. You may find yourself wanting to kick and punch things while you're not doing the dvd though, because it's so fun...

The warmup is basically doing gentle versions of most of the moves you learned in the tutorial. Part 1 is mostly upper body, though with kickboxing you're always doing lower body to some extent because of the form (always in a slight squat position and moving around on your balls of your feet). Part 2 is essentially lower body with a lot of squats and kicks, and Part 3 is a mix of upper and lower, but more fast paced so your heart rate gets up. The cool down is a lot of stretching, so you aren't as sore.

My only complaint is that she does the roundhouse kicks too quickly after she shows you how to do them. They are tough to get in the right position for, and I lose my balance a lot when doing them quickly. I am getting better though, so maybe it's a non-issue when I have more practice. DEFINITELY a workout I would recommend to anyone (without knee or elbow injuries, because if you don't use proper form you could injure yourself more) who is looking for a fun workout that they'll want to go back to. I think adding it to my collection of exercises is what made me start dropping pounds.",1340236800,,2224,4.3261390887290165

I have done it about 5 times now.  I have only gotten thru the training, warm-up and Fat burning #1 sections, but it is a GREAT workout.  Very fun.  I combine it with other videos because I am still learning the first few sections, which isn't enough for a full workout.  But, if you can get thru all the sections it would be a complete workout.  It is a really great stress reliever.  I highly recommend this DVD.  challenging, FUN, and gets results !",1336003200,,621,4.267241379310345

2625528,2,B000H1RFIM,"The DVD is what is markets itself to be, a Kick-boxing workout for Dummies.
It is very basic and moves slowly. When it is done, you are left asking, ""Is that it?""
This is NOT a dvd for serious Kickboxing lovers. This is a good START though.
One thing I didn't like was that the workout is void of excitement. There are no people in the background to amp up the energy and the woman leading tries to be exciting, but she is drole and plain.
If my review is too harsh, I have to say in all fairness, it is ""Fat-burning Kickboxing Workout for 'Dummies.'"" Perhaps I didn't really know what that meant.
I did feel a little burn in the morning so perhaps the ""fat-burning"" part is the real gold.",1302393600,,689,4.2272727272727275

2625531,5,B000H1RFIM,"I love this DVD!  The tutorial of the ring moves in the beginning is excellent.  If you're new to kickboxing, it's worth doing the tutorial before the workout until you get familiar with the ring moves.  This is a fast-paced DVD and an excellent workout!  Keli Roberts gives clear, concise instructions and makes the workout fun.  Be ready to sweat!  This workout is not for sissies!",1293580800,,383,4.7272727272727275
2625532,3,B000H1RFIM,"I'm going to preface that this comes from someone with little to no exercise background - I bought this to use on days where it was too crummy or cold to go for a proper long walk.

I love the instructor, she's really fun. If you are like me, you'll start with the ten basics and do fine with those, do the warm up and be keeping right along - but as soon as the ""real"" workout starts, you'll be a little lost.

I found it really hard to keep up with her. The ten basics do indeed cover basic moves, but I feel like she chains those basics with moves she never really covered - so you might be struggling to keep with the orders she's calling out. I also noticed a confusing change between the actions she does in the slow, ""preview"" mode she does first, then the actual movements in a faster pace. This leads to super confusion when you've finally got the movement down from the slower instructional take, and then she does something completely different, and fast too!

For someone who has never done anything like this before, that might be a little daunting. I've started with a warm up, try the second workout (which is all kicks, and kind of simpler to follow, and then the cool down. Maybe once I'm more comfortable with those I will try the others!",1285718400,,1256,4.313559322033898
2625533,1,B000H1RFIM,"I bought this because of FITNESS magazine's recommendation: The magazine claims that it would burn 700 calories for the workout. Not so.  I probably burned 50. I was looking for a DVD that gave me a little more cardio, and thought this might do the trick. I didn't even break a sweat!

I am extremely dissapointed in how easy the DVD is. There is nothing exciting or challenging about it!

If you are a TRUE beginner, this may be for you, but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone with even a moderate amount of physical activity. How can FITNESS Magazine call this one of the Top 10 DVD's out there?",1275523200,,595,4.390909090909091

2625541,4,B000H1RFIM,"Overall Rating: 4.5/5

I'd always been interested in learning kickboxing, so I began shopping around for an at home workout regimen that included kickboxing moves.  One called 'for Dummies' seemed like a good place to start.

I'm so glad I bought this!  I'll be honest, when I first got this, I wasn't in the best of shape, but I wasn't in horrible shape either.  I did the Top 10 and thought 'oh, no biggie, this'll be cake'.  Then I did the actual workout.

Or rather, tried to do.

I was flopping around, falling, trying to keep up, always ten moves behind.  I got frustrated really quick and was hurting myself doing the wrong thing the wrong way.

So I stopped.  Went back to the Top 10 and did it again.  And again.  I started doing the Top 10 every day, six times in a row, perfecting my form and getting totally comfortable with the moves.  And although the tutorial is much slower paced, I still had a sweat going by the time I was through.

I did this for a couple of weeks, five days a week, six times in a row.  Finally, I felt totally confident that I could get through the workout with no problems.

I managed to scuttle my way through it, but I was going slower than Keli, the instructor.  For every eight reps she did, I was managing about six.  I would lose my form when I tried to keep up with her because it switched from one move to the other quicker than I could set myself up to execute the move.

I finally figured it out.  What I do is, each time, I'll do the Top 10 once, as a warm up, getting my muscles reacquainted with each stance and execution.  Then, when I get into the workout, I've already got my moves down, and I don't have to fumble around during part of the main routine.

Another thing that I think helped me was learning the workout one section at a time, instead of tackling the whole thing.  There are three different workouts between the warm up and the cool down.  I would do one of them three times in a row instead of doing the other two.  I would do that every time I did the workout until I felt comfortable with the moves.  Then I'd start working on the second one and repeat the process until I mastered the whole thing.  This dvd is broken up into convenient segments, take advantage of that.  It's better to do it right than to do it fast.  Take this one slow and work into it.

I love the setup of this dvd.  The dvd itself is very easy to navigate through.  I like the modifications and hints it shows you during the workout.  I really like Keli Roberts as an instructor.  She's tough but doesn't take herself too seriously.  She's far less annoying than other instructors I've had on workouts.  I have a thing for accents, too, so her voice kind of makes me smile rather than annoys me.  She's got great energy without being obnoxious.

The warm-up on this one is pretty high energy, I think.  More so than warm-ups on other vids I've done.  That's another reason why I do the tutorial first- it acts as a prelude to the warm-up, gets me ready to go.

Fat Burning #1 is my least favorite of the three.  It was the most complicated for me to learn, moves wise, and maybe that frustration is still with me,  I do it, but it is always the one I skip if I'm pressed for time and only want to do one or two of the fat burning sequences.

Fat Burning #2 is my favorite of the three.  Not because it's the shortest, although that is a contributing factor, but because it focuses on kicks.  When I'm having a crappy day and I'm angry or frustrated or just have a lot of pent up energy, I love doing kicks.  It really gets the grr out.  I like it so much I'll sometimes do the whole set again just so I can kick some more.

Fat Burning #3 is the one that gets my blood pumping the most.  I really get in the zone when I'm doing this one.  The moves in this sequence don't flow in a normal way so it keeps you on your toes.  You have to really think about this one.  It switches back and forth instantly between two similar punches and then again with two similar kicks so you really have to know your form.  I've found saying the moves out loud as I do them helps me execute them better.

I really like the cool down.  I think it's during the cool down that you realize what a stress buster kickboxing is.  The music softens, the moves soften, the room starts to feel cooler as your sweat cools, and it feels so calm and peaceful compared to kicking and punching and bouncing you were doing two minutes ago.  It's very smooth, flowing from one stretch to the other, slowing down your body and breathing deep.  More than any other workout, this one is the best at improving my mood.  I normally keep it for days I don't have time to do a full length workout, but sometimes when I've had a particularly hard day I'll come home and do this workout, and make up the rest of my workout time on my elliptical.  This one is also great to bring when traveling because it's short, and most people away from home don't have too much time to devote to working out, and also because it requires no special equipment, so all you have to bring is the dvd.

I definitely recommend this workout to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to devote to working out as it gives you the most bang for your buck.  The Top 10 tutorial is so good that I'd even recommend this dvd to people who just wanted to learn some basic kickboxing moves and weren't necessarily interested in the workout portion.

If you're a beginner, have some patience, take it slow, and be persistent.  You'll get a lot out of this workout, guaranteed.

For those who aren't beginners, this would still be a great workout for when you're strapped for time.

Either way, you can't go wrong!",1248825600,,5686,4.231843575418995

Kelly Roberts is demonstrates her moves clearly in the instruction chapter. I have been doing this for the past couple of weeks. Yes this is for the beginner to the moderate exerciser. Anything that can get you moving is great! Try it.",1232323200,,384,4.5
2625547,1,B000H1RFIM,These may be basic moves but the pace is much too fast. I had chest pains after doing this workout. I would only recommend it to someone who is at an advanced fitness level and does high-impact cardio on a regular basis.,1231977600,,220,4.261904761904762
2625548,5,B000H1RFIM,"If you want to get up to speed fast, this is the right DVD for you.  It provides better, more detailed instructions on how to perform the moves properly than any other DVD that I've found.  What's more, the producers wisely placed these instructions in a separate tutorial section, so as not to disrupt the flow of the exercise routines themselves.

This DVD is geared toward beginners, but is still reasonably challenging for intermediate kickboxers.  Keli Roberts maintains a brisk pace throughout most of the DVD, and she's always lively and engaging. I would rank her among my top five favorite exercise video instructors of all time.

During the exercise routines, the DVD will occasionally display more basic or more demanding variations of the moves in use.  This is an excellent feature, and it's much better than merely having some additional exercisers demonstrate the move variations in the background. I only have one minor gripe: At times, it's not immediately obvious how the more intense moves vary from the regular ones.  This is a very minor complaint though, as it's not too hard to see how one can ramp up the intensity of the workout.",1225756800,,1154,4.887179487179488
2625549,4,B000H1RFIM,This is a pretty good product over-all.  The instructor is very helpful in explaining how moves are to be done.  It is done in segments so you can pick one segment or do all of them.  I am just learning how to do this so I have not in any way perfect Kick Boxing but it is fun and a good work our.,1218412800,,297,3.6825396825396823

2625551,4,B000H1RFIM,"This is a great DVD for beginners that haven't become ""couch potatos"".  It has plenty of variety for the newbie.  Eight years ago I was able to keep up with Billy Blanks, but at 58 and having slacked off a bit, this was enough to get me going again without ""scaring me off"".  I do workout to all 3 Fat Burning sessions at one time on the days I don't do resistance or weight training.  It's great for adding variety to your walking or step aerobic training.  If you're very active you may need to bump it up a notch.",1204329600,,516,4.12
2625552,4,B000H1RFIM,"This one was good and I actually enjoyed it. Its motivating and fun and it teaches you a new method of working out. It's not for pros (hence the name for dummies you guys), its for people starting out like me. So, if you want to start up again after leaving working out for a while this is great for you. It's also great for providing a good wholesome workout.

It's nice to learn this new sport, admittedly somewhat a limited education, and its great to take out some of your aggression! Overall a good buy.",1198022400,,508,4.291666666666667
2625553,3,B000H1RFIM,"This is great for beginners. Keli is alone & teaches you w/o distraction in 1/2 time or slower throughout the entire dvd proper form for kickboxing so you don't get sloppy & possibly injure yourself.
It's broken down into a 17 min. instruction & 3 workouts each one adding more punches & kicks.
Although I liked she went slow, I found it a bit boring. A martial arts friend said her form was fine. I'm picky about body awareness & though she moved well, I look for a workout that emphasizes on using this for self defense one day. Hence emphasizing on putting real energy & all you can into the kicks & punches. Her emphasis was on working out alone & seemed almost wimpy.

2625554,4,B000H1RFIM,"...this IS, in fact, a video for beginners. In case anyone was wondering.

That said, although I AM a beginning kickboxer, I am not mentally or physically deficient, so I found the mind-numbing repetition of this video to be somewhat off-putting. However, it is an excellent resource for those attempting to teach themselves kickboxing. While I wouldn't make it my daily (or weekly, or even monthly) workout, I will go to the Top Ten segment to refresh my back kick ever so often. I say this with a note of caution: even beginners get bored.

However, I love Keli Roberts, and her personality and style (not to mention the fact that she's actually DOING the workouts) make me smile every time I watch one of her videos. I would definitely suggest this to anyone looking for a reference for kickboxing form.",1190246400,,806,4.709219858156028

With that being the case, she goes slow so you do each and every move correctly and safely.  She also has a nice paced routine to utilize all of the moves she taught slowly during the tutorial section.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Keli Roberts really does a great job helping beginners, like me, learn such an exciting exercise.",1187740800,,478,4.642857142857143

Keli is so motivational without being too perky or in your face.  The music is also perfect; not too annoying.  I still sweat every time I do this video.  I'm looking into buying another one of her videos, too!",1174953600,,325,4.17741935483871

(That's what happens when skinny girls are too lazy to work out: they develop love handles and get flabby in problem areas). Well since I've been doing this DVD (4-5 times a week) for the past 2 weeks, I have noticed amazing results. I'm losing my problem areas rapidly, toning up, building stamina, regaining my balance and feeling so much more confident about myself. I'd say Kelli Roberts is a genius! DO IT!",1174867200,,542,4.776595744680851

Therefore, I encourage beginners to use it! Just don't expect a challenging workout if you are more advanced.",1173312000,,349,4.369230769230769

So easy, that I didn't even breathe heavily even when adding power moves to her routine.  Way too easy.  I didn't even feel like I worked out.  I just wasted 30 minutes and had to do another workout.  Not recommended for intermediate or advanced exercisers.",1169769600,,362,4.650793650793651

2625566,5,B000H1RFIM,"I've always wanted to learn kickboxing, but most DVDs are for intermediates, which often goes too fast and don't show you the basics.  This DVD has a tutorial for the Top Ten Kickboxing moves.  They include 1)Ring Moves, 2) Cross, 3) Hook, 4) Front Kick, 5) Sidekick, 6) Jab, 7) UpperCut, 8) Knee Thrust, 9) Back Kick, 10) Roundhouse.  The beginner can take their time mastering these basic moves before going on the other 3 kickboxing exercises, which the viewer can choose.  The beginner can also learn to do these moves right so that injuries can be avoided.  Keli takes her time and shows you the proper way to move.  This builds confidence and you won't feel like you'll fall behind when she goes a little quicker in her exercises.  After buying this DVD, I can forget about the fast paste TAE BO DVD's, which seem to be for fit folks who like to look competitive.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to take their time learning kickboxing right.",1161129600,,965,4.569767441860465
2625567,5,B000H1RFIM,"I've said it before; - Keli Roberts is one of the top 5 aerobic instructors in the universe.  She is amazing and if she really was your own personal trainer, you'd be as buff as a triathelete.  She would get results out of you that you wouldn't believe.  I've done some of her other workouts, and if done consistantly, there are fantastic results.

I don't have too many kickboxing dvds, and seeing that Keli leads this, I had to get it.  It's fantastic.  This is mainly geared for beginners in kickboxing and the impact is low and it's easy to follow because the moves are basic.  She goes at a fast pace, but this makes sure that you are always burning fat and calories.  If you are unsure about posture and your positioning, don't fret - she cues very well.  There is also some options for different intensity levels, so it doesn't matter if you are unfit or not.  I also like the safety tips they use throughout and the seperate instructional portion of the dvd that's done at the end.  This will really help you learn all the terminology and exactly how each move is done.

Keli really knows her stuff.  She has done quite a lot of kickboxing workouts in the past because she's good at it, so don't worry - you are in good hands and do this often during the week and you'll get some good results.  I love this and highly recommend it.  I find it fun too, so the workout goes by quickly.  Pick up a copy and see for yourself.",1159401600,,1429,4.295880149812734
