2917262,3,B000U95KCO,"Enjoyable show indeed, but some battles were dragged out over too many episodes and there was a definite lack of creativity as far as conflict resolution was concerned.",1194048000,,168,5.035714285714286
2917263,5,B000U95KCO,"Lina Inverse -- short, brash, flat-chested and monstrous of appetite and magical power. She's too brilliant an anti-heroine to just use once.

And her little gang reunites rather explosively in ""Slayers Next - The Complete Second Season,"" where Lina and Co. deal with various magical threats and problems... as well as a bunch of monsters who want Lina dead for some reason. It's a darker, more intricate story than the first season, but it doesn't lose touch with the same deranged humor and lovably quirky characters.

The gang reunites in the kingdom of Xoana (where Amelia and Zelgadis become enemies for about ten minutes) just before a battle with the deranged Princess Martina, who wants to sacrifice the world to her imaginary Monster friend. One Dragonslave later, and the kingdom is in ruins.

Then they start out on a quest for the legendary magic book called the Claire Bible, which is dogged by ""mysterious priest"" Xellos (who is more than he seems, obviously). And they have to deal with weird problems along the way: curses from the crazed Martina, a sorcerous feud that upends an entire city, the hunt for dragon cuisine (""Oh god of cookery, give me strength!""), a magical tennis game, a tower of magic dolls and weird obstacles, a city that bans men, and a hunt for ancient divine spells that turns out to be all wrong.

But the real trouble starts when the gang makes it to Amelia's country of Seyruun -- and discovers that a conspiracy of greedy royals and evil Monsters want Lina very, very dead. Unfortunately, nobody knows why. The gang sets out to discover the reason why on a journey riddled with Golden Dragons, malignant Monsters, and the true form of the Claire Bible and its keeper. But their mysterious enemies have plans for Lina and her ultimate attack spell... which may bring about the end of the world.

Spoofs of the fantasy genre are a dime a dozen. The real challenge is creating a spoof that also has a story and mythology all its own -- and ""Slayers Next"" succeeds brilliantly at doing that. Not only is the second season of ""Slayers"" gutsplittingly funny, it has a really solid storyline, excellent writing and thoroughly enjoyable characters -- including some moments that are beautifully dramatic and horrifying too.

The main storyline really kicks in when the gang arrives in Seyruun, after some hints and foreshadowing, and after that it keeps twisting and changing, revealing one secret at a time -- Lina's pursuers, their motives, and how devastatingly powerful they are. And it takes the usual fantasy tropes -- big dumb guy with magic sword, powerful sorceress, demonic creatures, plucky naive princess -- and promptly turns them on their heads.

Things start getting grimmer in the middle when the gang finds the true Claire Bible, and that darker undercurrent gets thicker all the way to the end. The climax is literally apocalyptic in its scope -- a brilliantly intense piece of work.

And there's a lot of humour too, ranging from Zelgadis being used as an anchor (""Poor Mr Zelgadis... we can at least let you breathe down there!"") to a series of running gags (""That.... is a SECRET""). At least half the episodes contain and/or end with some kind of massive explosion and/or rioting. And a couple stories wedged between the two arcs are entirely devoted to comedy -- usually they involve a more relaxed tone, with Zelgadis and Gourry in drag, idol singing, and the whole gang dressing up in big silly animal costumes.

Lina continues to be a hilarious anti-heroine with a short fuse and a seemingly endless arsenal of explosion spells, but visions of a Gigaslave gone wrong -- and Gourry's abduction -- show how much she loves her buddies. Yogurt-brained Gourry is a good complement to Lina, and hyperactive princess Amelia struggles with treachery within her loving family (and has some cute romantic moments with Zel). Zelgadis is the best-rounded character of the bunch, struggling with his insecurities, his image, and his stony-skinned body.

""Next"" also introduces a couple of brilliant new characters. Xellos is a puckish trickster who flits in and out, causing trouble just for the fun of it,  and announcing that whatever he's talking about ""is a SECRET."" He's a delightfully infuriating guy, and much more than he appears. And Martina is basically there for the comic relief -- a very insane princess who worships a Monster she made up herself, and keeps trying to curse/kill Lina.

""Slayers Next"" is a brilliant fantasy spoof with a clever, twisting storyline and plenty of laugh-out-loud humor. Definitely a must-see -- along with the other seasons.",1245110400,2,4614,4.916452442159383
2917264,5,B000U95KCO,"I love this series.  It's so much fun and the DVDs are great.  I upgraded to the DVDs from the VHSs.  If you don't know much about this series, don't even look up the info, just buy the DVD set and watch it, you won't be disappointed!",1241740800,2,234,3.9361702127659575
2917265,5,B000U95KCO,"Slayers Next is overall the best season of Slayers. And in this package you can own all 26 episodes for a very reasonable price.  It is true however that the overall quality of the DVD transfer here leaves room for improvement, despite the nebulous claim to ""remastering"".  Ignoring that loaded term, the episodes look otherwise fine for the age of the series. And of course with these DVDs one can switch between both the excellent English and Japanese voice work at will.

The show itself--the second season of Slayers--contains the best overall balance of humor, gravitas, and animation of the seasons. Original Slayers remains fun to watch, of course, though Next really does look a step above in animation.  The later Slayers Try also has relatively impressive animation, but is populated by more significant highs and lows.  Specific episodes of Try are some of the funniest episodes of all Slayers (especially the volatility of Filia and Xellos).  But other--usually filler--episodes of Try are in some cases actually painfully bad.

Slayers Next gets almost everything right, including an epic series of final episodes with a wonderful ending that continues to overshadow the rest of the series (including the new Revolution/Evolution currently showing in Japan).

In many ways, Slayers Next is akin to The Empire Strikes Back or The Wrath of Khan, being the ""superb second entry"" of the given series.  And thus of all seasons I consider it a must-own for any animation collection.",1239321600,2,1489,5.094650205761317
2917266,5,B000U95KCO,"Slayers NEXT is the second season to the 1995 TV Anime ""The Slayers"".  Both seasons are based off novels written by Hajime Kanzaka.  This season of Slayers is 26 episodes long, like the first one is.  In my opinion, it has the perfect balance of comedy/seriousness, and every episode has memorable moments, even the filler episodes are 5 star quality.

This season introduces Xellos, the trickster priest.  A favorite character among many Slayers fans.  He has comical charm with his wacky antics, and at the same time a mysterious motive that will keep you wondering what it is he's really up to.

Watching this kept me wanting more and more, and I didn't stop watching until I reached the end.

Chances are, if you liked season 1, you will like this too. Maybe even more.  I recommend this to anyone who likes the fantasy/comedy genres",1219622400,6,837,4.7172413793103445
2917267,3,B000U95KCO,"If you're still interested in that flat chested, wildly acerbic child- errr Woman. and if you can indulge her in all those Dragon Slave explosions. Then this here is the treat for you!",1218240000,,184,4.606060606060606
2917268,5,B000U95KCO,"While I can't speak to any particular production issues that this release of Slayers: Next may have, I can say that it is absolutely my favorite season of anime, period.  The mood of the show varies between dangerously silly (ie: The Macho Dragon Blood Battle Brothers bandit gang!) and deadly serious, with a more episodic quality improving the re-watchability of the component episodes.  The humor of the series -- which really is the hallmark of the series -- translates fabulously from the japanese without relying on obnoxious fan-servicey behaviors.  The production quality of the show is looking a bit dated (compared to, say, Samurai Champloo which was a surprisingly good show) but the writing is absolutely top-notch for an honest-to-goodness swords & sorcery adventure slug-fest.",1213401600,2,790,5.304
2917269,4,B000U95KCO,The second season is even better than the first. Continuing the adventure with Lina is all you need. Just sitting in front of the TV watching this is all you need to do.,1208044800,,169,4.151515151515151
2917270,4,B000U95KCO,"Lina Inverse is back, with her Black Magic, her greedy heart and her grumbling tummy.  Watch out, because she'll steal anything not nailed down and eat anything on the table.  Now she fights for the good and the beautiful of the world.  No, I'm joking.  Things are never that simple and now, as she and her fellow comades team up to find a certain Bible they all want, they may also end up saving the world.  Even if that's not the point!
Not as good as the first season but still good to add to your collection of comedy, fantasy, adventure anime.",1205107200,,548,4.333333333333333
2917271,1,B000U95KCO,I don't know if I'm the only one having bad luck here.  I bought this as a gift to update their Slayers collection to DVDs.  The brand new DVDs were already scratched upon opening causing the DVDs to pause frequently.  I returned the item to Amazon.com for a replacement which was quick and easy.  The replacement came about a week after I submitted the return request.  Once again the new DVDs are scratched though not as badly.  This has never happened to me before at any store.,1200009600,,481,4.471264367816092
2917272,5,B000U95KCO,"""Slayers Next"" is typically cited as the best season of this fantasy/comedy anime that should serve as a centerpiece to any animation collection.  I've already gone over the show's basics on my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Slayers-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000MTOMAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Slayers - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;so I'll cut to the chase here.  While the first season is my favorite, this is in no way an inferior outting for Lina and her band of merry misfits.  Many new characters are introduced, all the favorites from season one are back, and the storylines continue to balance comedy reminiscent of the Three Stooges with an epic fantasy universe that seems to live and breathe on it's own.

This second season expands on that universe and manages to ramp up the tension as Lina Inverse is forced to learn more and more dangerous magics to keep pace with the chaos-worshipping demons that intend to destroy mankind.  That's not to say that our heroine doesn't find plenty of time to fight over food (one of her passions), pick on bandits and other pathetic would-be villains (it's a hobby),  and destroy a kingdom or two with her Dragon Slave spell.  Her primary nemesis for much of this season is Martina, a princess displaced by Lina's aforementioned destruction who worships a monster named Zomoulgustar.  Sound like a name an autistic kid would think up?  Welllll....
Martina's usually poorly though out attempts at revenge provide plenty of comic relief throughout the season, but don't think that Gourry gets off the hook.  He picks up an admirer of his own; a rogue swordsman who wishes to duel with him.  But who has the time with all these apocalypses to avert?  But the newcomer most beloved by fans is the mysterious priest Xellos; a character fond of dropping hints at crucial plot points and then, when asked for more specific information, declaring ""That.....is a secret"" with his pointer finger thrust upward for emphasis and then disappearing.

Who the hell is this Xellos guy?  Will Martina ever get a life?  What manner of beast could possibly challenge the mighty Lina Inverse at this point?  Will the jokes about Lina's small breasts ever cease?  All questions will be answered and there will be both dungeons and dragons aplenty for fantasy buffs.  ""Slayers Next"" delivers exactly what fans of the first season would want: more of the same.  More characters, more action, more madness, more magic, more slapstick, and best of all more Lina Inverse.  If you dug season one, have no fear; this is exactly what you'd hope for in a sophomore season.",1196726400,13,2665,5.182242990654205
8212387,3,B000U95KCO,"Slayers was such a smash hit and a wonderful action/comedy series with so much potential it was a must that it would see a sequel. Thus, a year later Slayers Next would be released and fans could enjoy the newest adventures featuring Lina Inverse and crew. When moving into a new series which laid out the ground work so well in the original, one would hope that none of the charm is left out while along the way making some improvements. Slayers Next definitely sticks to what made the series great for sure: the wit, comedy, action, mild development, it's there; yet at the same time, outside of the visuals there really isn't too much improvement.

 The plot follows Lina Inverse as she searches for a magical artifact called The Claire Bible which contains some very necessary spells for her. Her friend and comrade in arms Zelgadis wants the book in hopes to returning to his human form. The band once again comes together and it's off on a new quest.

 The visuals are clearly the most noticeable improvement with character designs, setting and static backgrounds appearing to be more crisp and detailed. Castles and underground labyrinths look a lot better, and there are also some pretty moments when the characters travel to other dimensions or alternate worlds. The final battle towards the end has a nice dark, end of the world like setting that truly feels as if this is the end. The battles look a little better as well despite the lack of choreography at times; the light shows are still something to get pretty excited about. The BGM is still just as good creating the right feeling for whichever situation is necessary.

 This season sticks to its guns delivering the comedy along with action and it does succeed a good portion of the time; but one's enjoyment is clearly going to be decided on how much they bought into the characters earlier on. The first half of the series spins its wheels on delivering something of a plot. It's true that smaller details come into play, such as a major demon by the name of Gaav possessing a hidden motive to lure out Lina which leads into his personal feud with another demon; but there's so much filler taking place and stories that serve no purpose it's difficult to hide that this stuff is simply to prolong the series. I did have fun watching some of this, yet the lack of progress grew a little frustrating. The second half finally starts to deal with these plot threads that were introduced, and things start to get good, and I mean really good leading up to a couple of good battles and an ending worth waiting for.

 Lina sees some development and becomes a bit more well rounded, and some of the side characters receive a bit as well coming together more as a family; the characters aren't even 60% developed but they really don't need it because their personalities alone carries the weight. Some of the battles are quite creative with nice outcomes and I loved their use of teamwork on some things.

 In closing, although Slayers Next looks better and retains everything that made it special in the first place. It still suffers from the repeated jokes and obvious episode stretching; the jokes worked very well in the original because it was new stuff and many times unexpected. I like the characters a lot, still I need something more than watching Lina blast bandits to bits and watching the gang chow down practically every episode. It just gets to the point where some things aren't as funny anymore. I still recommend giving this a shot to everyone who fell for the original series.

 Highs: Maintains everything that made it great, better visuals

 Lows: Needed better progress, some jokes are redundant",1453680000,,3677,4.698289269051322

A very fun series to watch. Gourry is as jellyfish-brained as he usually is, Amelia is as adorable as ever, Zel is as angsty as his usually bad-ass self, and Lina is as fiery as usual, too. No pun on Lina intended here (those who have seen this series will get the pun).

If you love humorous Anime this one is full of joke and some episodes that are just insane funny and silly. If you love serious animae with actions and fighting this one, aside from three or four episodes and a few scenes, is all about fighting and magic.

8212395,5,B000U95KCO,"I borrowed my friend's Slayers DVDs years ago and fell in love with this series, so when I found this Slayers Next DVD set, I knew I had to have it. The sheer awesomeness of the series was no surprise to me, but the HOT price and the expediency by which it arrived certainly were!

The three DVDs in this set come with complete menus, and the episodes are separated into chapters so you can get to the right spot without having to fast-forward the whole way through like you're using a VCR!! Sounds crazy, but I have an anime box set that is like that =\ The choice of the English & Japanese audio is very nice, too, and it has a few small extras.
