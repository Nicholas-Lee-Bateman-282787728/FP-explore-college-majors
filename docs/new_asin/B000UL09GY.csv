8213658,4,B000UL09GY,"First off, its a 5 disk set, each disk containing one 30 minute episode as well as a plethora of extras. The disks are double sided, the reverse containing an assortment of other hentai titles. Animation quality is okay, considering its age (1999). The story, though cliche, does have some amusing dialogue early on. Quite a few demi-humans involved in scenes. Some of the voice actors sound a tad flat, lacking proper inflection. The stock combat footage gets a bit old after awhile though. Despite its flaws, its still a worthwhile view, assuming you can get it for a decent price.",1407456000,,583,4.782178217821782
8213659,5,B000UL09GY,"(1) This series is not for everyone. You have to be in a frame of mind for something different. In this series there are sex scenes (including typical Hentai style rape) involving humans, anthropomorphic ( furry style) creatures, and half man half animal characters. This series is not just another Hentai, in which a girl is being forced to have relations with a tentacle monster...there are many different style creatures involved. Some of the s-x scenes in this series (this list also includes those, ""almost"" s-x scenes)  include (a) a woman and a anthropomorphic horse character (he uses his mouth, and not much else) (b) man and women (c) weird demon (I think he was suppose to be a demon) king with young girl (d) two pig anthropomorphic characters and a girl (e) weird human/ animal/ cat girl with man, and more.
(2) Unlike most Hentai, this particular series does have a story line to it. Yes, there are several s-x scenes, BUT if that's the only reason why you are buying this movie you will be disappointed. There is (as I had written above) a story line, which is accompanied by sex scenes, and not sex scenes accompanied by a story line
(3) This series was set in a distant time (knights, and monsters). However, it also has a fantasy element which can be interesting for some, and a ""what?"" for others. Some characters might be a little too strange/ throw people out of the story. For example the strange skeleton character who is alive/ a guard.
(4) This series can drag on at times. I had fast-forwarded some of the scenes...but over all the story is good.
Actually, the story has a flavor of the following movies/series: Dragon Ball Z (due to the strange alien looking creatures/ the bubbly personality of the prince-similar to Goku), Harry Potter (the whole magical element/creatures-not as well written as Potter). For some reason it also has a mild flavor of Ruroni Kenshin, but I can't explain why???? A little bit of the Hobbit/the Lord of the Rings (I'm referring only to the Rankin and Bass Cartoon versions). However, please keep in mind that the Words Worth series only has a light flavor of the movies/series mentioned above, so don't watch it thinking it is exactly like these movies/series. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IS XXX RATED AND NOT FOR CHILDREN.
Personally, I really like the Words Worth series. But I ALSO like weird/ different things.
This series might be more for those people who are into furry (due to some of the animal styled characters)? It is a hard movie to describe/ and to find the audience that it was intended for. As far as I'm concerned, this series should have more positive reviews, if not just for its overall bizzare concept/theme.",1407283200,2,2685,4.7006369426751595
8213660,3,B000UL09GY,"I didn't like Words Worth all that much cause it's the only hentai I know that takes place back in the Knights times and it's a little sci-fi.

The legend has survived for generations. Words Worth which will unlock the secerts of the Universe for the one who can decipher it, has been shattered. The warring tribes of Light and Shadow blame each other, and their accusations lead to all out war!",1128038400,,395,4.486111111111111
8213661,2,B000UL09GY,"I'll tell you the truth, I've only seen the first two episodes, and then I had the inclination to burn the CD, my computer, and the desk it was on. But I didn't because I like my computer, and desk, and the CD was borrowed from my friend Joel. But before I include anymore of my own bias I will give a short summary of the series. I admit that the series does have a legendary first line: ""first there was the light, and the dark,...but these were not their final form."" From there it fast forwards a while to where a big important stone has been broken, thus the land is in chaos. The main characters are a sensual voluptuous woman (a princess), who of course is very energetic, and a male lead who is a horny, weak, cowardly warrior, who is to eventually prove himself strong and brave, and still horny. There is an ensemble of kings queens, witches wizards, elf and the occasional half man half animal person, which is nothing unusual.
Overall the storyline reveals itself as a very serious fight between good and evil, with some scenes of good humor, and plenty of tasteless sex. There is the obvious polar conflict between two factions, with battles, spying, and intrigue. Of course the main female protagonist getting captured and held hostage, which of course leads to sex. The male lead (part of the opposing clan, of course) finds her captured, and in a dishevelled state, and offers to help lick her wounds, which, of course, leads to sex. And while this goes on the kings are in an epic battle.
This is an anime for fans who don't mind, or even like, watching sex, with a relatively intricate plot in between the, uh, action. Oh, and plenty of medieval battles. It is still entertaining...in a way. If anything it's entertaining as a flic of pure camp. This is definitely not one to show the young ones, unless you have the time to do a full edit on a pro editing suite. Obviously this would cut down the anime quite a bit. Certainly anime for a certain discerning taste.",1084838400,5,1982,4.4779005524861875
