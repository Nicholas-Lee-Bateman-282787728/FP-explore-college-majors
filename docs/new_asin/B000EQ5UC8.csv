8112782,4,B000EQ5UC8,"Released on DVD 2006 by ArtsMajic as part of  """"War the Archive Collection"" this is possibly a digital transfer of the 1996 VHS documentary {unsure]. The disk has trailer samples of 23 titles in the series.
Running time is stated as 55min and consists  of WWII archive b&w footage with overdubbed modern narration and background sound ,which seems to be generic engine noise ,battle sounds, aircraft sounds and explosions edited in as appropriate. Sometimes the narration is over the background sound effects, sometimes the background sound runs alone or sometimes the film has no edited audio at which time the background is reasonably silent ;without electronic noise. The audio levels seem coherent throughout the film. The film opens with some orchestral music of a military sort . The quality here is appalling and sounds as if it was transferred from a disc retrieved from the Fuehrerbunker.
Perhaps the director did this deliberately as the subject matter is , as you might expect ,entirely about destruction.
The narration ,by an Englander, is unemotional, factual , and slightly soporific; in the style achieved by some university lecturers.
The video contains stills but is mostly moving . The luminance  ,contrast and sharpness vary but are acceptable given the origin of the images.
THis film isn""t a detailed analysis of the Panzer VI as a machine, although some significant technical information is given. The Panzer VI and its
derivatives are described primarily as tactical weapons in the context of battles actually fought . In fact there is some interesting combat video from several locations and stages of WWII. Dates ,deployments ,military units ,commanders are frequently mentioned. Michael Wittmann ,the hero of the Panzers,gets special attention.
This documentary gives a useful overview of the development and use of the Panzer VI  in various forms with emphasis on the Tiger and King Tiger in historical progression. As a result of the tactical emphasis you get a sense of the course of WWII in North Africa, Russia and Europe. Also some insight into Nazi Germany military organisation.
If you are curious about the Tiger VI this DVD certainly gives plenty of entry level information.",1445731200,,2210,5.182072829131653
8112783,5,B000EQ5UC8,"Unlike the Panzer video in the same series, this has considerable footage of the subject tank. It also has rare footage of various Soviet tanks.",1433808000,,144,4.8
8112784,3,B000EQ5UC8,"This DVD has video on three of Germany's largest tanks, the Tiger, King Tiger and Sturmtiger. The footage dedicated to each is roughly in line with what actual production was of each vehicle during WWII (i.e., about 65% dedicated to Tiger, 30% to King Tiger and 5% to Sturmtiger). The footage of Tigers and King Tigers is not particularly impressive if one has seen many photos of these in other sources (i.e., Osprey or Schiller books on these vehicles). The few seconds of Sturmtiger footage, however, is as it is the only known footage (still or film) of this vehicle in combat.

In terms of information, the dvd contains much less than one would find in any Osprey or Shiller book on the subject. If one has knowledge beyond that of a novice this dvd would have no real value (at least in terms of new information) on the vehicles. However, for someone who has no knowledge it would provide an interesting introduction to the subject (albeit only touching on it).",1258934400,2,967,4.654970760233918
8112785,5,B000EQ5UC8,"I own this video that was originally marketed under another title but the content is the same. I consider it an excellent documentary of the Tiger I and II. Yes, some of the archival footage is a little scratchy, but it is real combat footage and includes rare scenes of Tigers in combat showing their employment in battle. It contains little-covered topics such as recovery of damaged Tigers. I feel it is far preferable to the History Channel stuff with the terrible reenactments using fake Tigers (In one instance, they have a Tiger turret mounted on a T-34 hull!). The amount of authentic archival footage alone is worth the price.",1226275200,7,635,4.781818181818182
8112786,3,B000EQ5UC8,"As many have commented before on other movies in this series, the information and footage isn't new. I have almost the entire series of tank movies. These DVD's are mostly (I stress mostly!) accurate. The footage isn't the greatest and the narrator might put you to sleep - sometimes he sounds like he is falling asleep himself, and often they reuse the same footage more than once in the movie.

But, if you love WW2 German tanks and planes, it's worth checking out the whole series. If you're a hardcore tank fan like I am, you might be a little disappointed.

But, the price is reasonable, and you might still learn something new.",1163635200,15,633,4.592920353982301
8112787,3,B000EQ5UC8,"Chronos of the UK released this documentary on Videotape a number of years ago. This DVD is that same documentary. Because this documentary consists of old Black & White German and newsreel footage the quality is not the best. Therefore you may ask yourself if having a DVD is necessary. Since the footage is of old scratchy film, having a VHS tape is just as good as the DVD. It has not been remastered.  The documentary itself is good considering the source material. The British Voiceover is pretty dry but informative. This is one of the best documetaries available with Tiger footage, it is just deceiving to market this as a fresh product. - KH in Southington, CT",1151366400,19,669,4.669491525423729
