4885328,3,B005SHBO1Y,"Kevin Hart is a great comic no doubt about that, love his stuff. I paid to watch this movie and I'll continue to pay to watch his stuff. In the scheme of things though this was off the mark somewhat; did I laugh, sure did, did I at times find myself sitting there thinking was there something I forgot to do today, sure did. Great comics, great performers in general set the bar pretty high for the execution of their craft, this effort was OK and very much worth a watch (and the dosh) if you're a big fan but if you're looking for a shining example of Kevin's work perhaps another selection is in order.",1440288000,,605,4.224137931034483

4885350,2,B005SHBO1Y,"I adore Kevin Hart.  He's possibly the funniest man in American comedy at this time.  But, as with baseball players, we can't expect a comedian to hit a home run every time he gets up to bat.  In a couple of reviews of his other DVD comedy concerts I gave him 5 stars and a rave review.  But this DVD was disappointing.

It's not that I cringe whenever I hear expletives used by a comedian.  It's just that I always believed that when you get a laugh due to an obscenity, rather than by an inherently funny joke...well, that's a cheap laugh.  Every high school kid alive can get a laugh that way.  One of the beauties of Kevin Hart's comedy has usually been that without dwelling on obscenities, he can put the audience into hysterics.

Unfortunately, in this comedy concert he resorted to the cheap laugh over and over again.  And just to show you that I don't dislike anything vulgar, his having sex with the stool routine was hilarious.  But Kevin is too brilliant a comedian to need to throw f--- and s--- into every other sentence.

So, what the result?  In this DVD he begins to sound too much like every other African-American comedian.  Two of his other DVDs are on my shelf.  This one went in the dumpster.  Not at his best here.  No one is at the summit all of the time.  But I'm still looking forward to his next appearance.",1416441600,,1335,4.357723577235772

4885390,4,B005SHBO1Y,Kevin Hart deserves a round of applause for this stand up! He keeps your attention and doesn't miss a beat with his punchlines. His jokes are based on serious topics but he finds the humor in it which makes you appreciate it even more. True comedian!,1407196800,,250,4.456521739130435
4885391,4,B005SHBO1Y,"The beginning was just some weird talking about Kevin Hart, so it was boring (I recommend spiking that part, unless you wanna know harts history). The stand up it self is really funny and recommend everyone to watch it.

But I think to enjoy him, you need to understand and like his own style of delivering jokes. Some people don't like it, others don't mind, personally i think that is what makes him unique.

4885420,4,B005SHBO1Y,"This man, Kevin Hart is sooooo funny, and hilarous it's crazy. His funny, not like I'll tell you jokes, and see if you laugh but more like, similar to Dave Chappelle or something, in storytelling and his acting, ease of telling something/story thats funny and without trying or making it seem so easy and natural.

I don't know, I think he's really funny on stage and in characters in film as well. So, check him out--try 'em out; I think you will probably enjoy it...if you like or know him at all or some of his body of film/movies. Plus, if you enjoy comedians and actors like Dave Chappelle or Eddie Murphy, etc then more than likely you will enjoy this smartly titled show/film>> ""Keven Hart: Laugh at my Pain"" comedic stage performance. It is assuredly without a doubt a knock-out and a  home run delivery/performance in story telling that was explosive and definetly Entertaining!",1402704000,,887,4.716129032258064

4885422,5,B005SHBO1Y,I love Kevin's down-to-earth delivery of comedy!  His style is unique... and I can totally relate to the crazy family drama he speaks about.  If you have been living under a rock and don't own this - get it!,1399939200,,207,4.282051282051282

4885425,5,B005SHBO1Y,"I think I've already reviewed this CD.  Really funny, a lot of father stuff in it.  I guess it's part of his life, although as Kevin mentions, he was on drugs and could only come up to the third step at his house.  As a woman it's hard to hear, because I feel for his mother who had probably little to no help with the bills, and/or errands, meal preparation, etc. to give the kids of a life.",1398556800,,392,4.0

4885429,4,B005SHBO1Y,"Loved Kevin Hart in his recent movie, ""Ride Along"", regardless of what the ""experts' reviews may have said.  Kevin Hart is FUNNY!  I smile just looking at him.  He tells real life stories in a way that informs you a out his life as he looks back at it now from a place of acceptance and humor.  Probably my favorite comedian (& he's a good actor, as well) right now.  He makes me laugh out loud, & it's a tall order to get me to do that.  Everyone has their own taste & sense of what's funny.  He is that for me.  Quick, witty, sarcastic, makes light of what must have been a tough life.

His material is excellent but I didn't do 5 stars because I'd heard a few of these life scenarios in others of his performances.  As well, when I watched the extra/bonus footage, I didn't care for his treatment of his wife or ex-wife...either way, his children's momma.  That brought him down some notches for me.  But his comedy remains excellent...if kept separate from his real personal life, in my opinion.",1395446400,,999,4.34054054054054

4885450,5,B005SHBO1Y,He is the best comedian at this time. He truly appreciated his fans and realizes they are the ones that make him wealthy,1389830400,,120,4.260869565217392
4885451,5,B005SHBO1Y,He is a very funny comedian. The second coming of Eddie Murphy.  He is going to go down in the history as one of the best comedians of the century. A must see for anyone who loves great stand up comedy.,1389830400,,202,3.926829268292683

4885453,2,B005SHBO1Y,"I saw Kevin Hart a few years ago in one of his first stand-up videos. I LOVED HIM.  Belly laughed through the whole thing.  Although he was not famous at that point, I continued to follow his career and have enjoyed seeing him in movies and follow-up performances.

He's absolutely adorable, witty, versatile and just plain hilarious.  His take-offs on family and friends are precious and so right on.

But this video has no heart.  Lots of ""F"" bombs, both unnecessary and too easy; and a fair amount of not very funny sexual material.

Is it fame?  Is there some kind of sophistication in riffing on the same old bedroom behavior? In dropping ""f"" every other sentence?

His previous routines have warmth, vulnerability, depth and humour.  The characters are richer and deeper and funnier.

I am disappointed in this video, especially compared to his earlier work.

I will continue to follow his career because he's very good.  I hope that this was just a bump in the Hollywood walk of fame.",1389744000,,991,4.7251461988304095

4885461,5,B005SHBO1Y,"Quite a few laugh out loud moments. Very tight show. Kevin had control from start to end, and it showed. Even thru ""improv ""moments. I have watched it on several occasions with different people and found true gems of comedy each time.",1388275200,,234,4.595238095238095
4885462,3,B005SHBO1Y,"Love, love, LOVE his other shhh but honestly...funny as this one is, you almost wouldn't know it. The pacing on this one is straight up Speedy Gonzalez style, leaving you wondering if he's not on the same drugs that he's so honestly and hilariously joked of his dad being on. The timing and pacing is just horrid. It just feels like he's running through some  dry too-many-times-repeated lines with all the HEART and soul of a well-read, socially anxiety ridden elementary school student blazing forcibly through his reading aloud of the Bill of Rights. Halfway through he seems to settle in and find his groove and pace it to a degree where you have time to laugh. Not tryin to hate though! Much, MUCH love to Kevin. Watch it! Very funny! Not his best though : (",1388102400,,763,4.569343065693431

4885481,2,B005SHBO1Y,Wasted time telling and showing where he grew up and after this long wait he finally gets on stage and continues to tell foul mouthed stories of when he grew up which is fine if it is funny. I've heard others do the same growing up stories but they were funny. It should be titled Feel my Pain instead because after a little more than half way through this Pain I changed to something else.,1383350400,,390,4.213333333333333

4885483,3,B005SHBO1Y,"Some of his routine was funny, but I could not relate to a lot of it. The comparison to some of the funnier comics is that many are funny people, and they turn perfectly normal situations into very funny material. Kevin is a pretty normal guy, very smart, but not as truely funny as some others. I think he has been getting better than he was, so if you liked any of his older material, you may like this even better.",1382400000,,417,4.160493827160494

Im not sure why so many people thought this was a repeat of seriously funny he really put his all into this one and i loved it especially the skit at the end. Usually im not easily entertained but this really really blew me away i always watch it when im in a bad mood and all my problems seem too float into outer space.,1339545600,,474,3.9479166666666665

I'll buy each subsequent DVD he comes out with, to include #thinklikeaman, until he does something (like Katt Williams - just fell off the grid) that makes me choose to no longer support his career.

Still a funny movie, and a must have addition to your other comedies.",1335312000,,520,4.559139784946237

4885621,3,B005SHBO1Y,"This Is The Follow Up 2 ""Seriously Funny"". Does It Match Up?......No, But That Doesnt Mean That Its Not Funny In Its Own Way. Basically, Kevin Gives You A More Personal Look Into Who He Is, While Hes At New Heights In His Career. The Movie Starts With Kevin Back In Philly, Looking Back At His Life And Career With Friends And Family. The Stand Up Content Is Basically The Same With Kevin As It Always Has Been (His Kids, Relationships, Arkward Moments And Sex) But The Jokes Just Arent As Funny As ""Seriously Funny"". After The Stand Up, There Is A Bank Robbery Sequence With The Plastic Cup Boys And Also Taraji Henson As A Bank Teller. The Robbery Sequence Is Extremely Random And Doesn't Flow Well At All With The Rest Of The Movie. The Most Interesting Thing Outside Of The Stand Up Is The Fact That LARRY KING Actually Interviews Kevin's Father, Who Clears Up Some Of The Things That Kevin Talks About In The Stand Up. Overall This Movie Is Funny But Even On The DVD Itself Theres A Sticker That Says You Should Watch ""Seriously Funny"".....Now Thats Funny.",1331424000,3,1061,4.5025906735751295

4885627,5,B005SHBO1Y,"I totally think he should have called this video, ""Seriously Funny Again!""  I thought it was gonna be boring when they started, but even the beginning of the movie where they are in his hometown is funny!  Great movie.  Kevin Hart is a comedy gangster!",1330041600,,252,4.555555555555555

4885636,5,B005SHBO1Y,I wish I would have waited and watched it on DVD instead of watching it on comedy central. It was so much more funny because comedy central cut out a lot of parts.,1327708800,,163,3.9696969696969697

4885638,5,B005SHBO1Y,"Saw this in the movies and laughed from the time it started to the end. Kevin had some really funny routines. I could not wait for the dvd to be released so that I could share this with my family and friends that did not get a chance to see it. To me, he was funnier than any other comedian that I've come across in my many years on this earth and I've seen alot, from Eddie Murphy to the all time greatest Richard Prior. Kevin has them beat!",1327536000,,442,3.9775280898876404
4885639,5,B005SHBO1Y,"Kevin Hart is hilarious. Through and through, he is the funniest comedian working. Whether he's talking about ostriches running beside the car or his mom's unorthodox parenting, he has such a talent at making everything funny. Laugh At My Pain takes that to a new level.

Laugh At My Pain is all about Kevin's life. Everything from his dad being a drug addict to his mother's funeral to his divorce, he doesn't hold anything back. But, this is more than just Kevin Hart doing stand up. This is about Kevin remembering where he came from, remembering situations and people that made him who he is today, and the first twenty or so minutes of the film is nothing but that, culminating in an emotional speech in front of all his family thanking them for always being there.

I get that making stand up specials more like documentaries is popular now. Katt Williams has been doing that for a while now. But Kevin Hart's Laugh At My Pain is so much more. Yes, the intro is him walking us through Philadelphia, his old stomping grounds and a family supper. Yes, there is a stand up special. But, after the special there's another 30 minute show(?) that depicts Kevin's own spin on the classic movie Resevoir Dogs. This is so unbelievably funny and unexpected that it earns the price of admission alone. Without giving too much away, it centers around Kevin and his friends (un)successfully robbing a bank.

Laugh At My Pain is a touching, hilarious show that sheds a bit more light on Kevin Hart's upbringing. The show is hilarious, bringing tears to my eyes more than once, and the bonus intro and outro only make the package more worthy of buying. Though, as for the stand up portion itself, I think Seriously Funny was a little better. The shortness of this special--a mere 40 minutes--does take away some points though. Just when he seems to be breaking stride he's done. Though, that could just be a testament to his talent. You always want more. Highly recommended.",1327363200,,1965,4.673410404624278
4885640,1,B005SHBO1Y,"So unfunny it's hard to believe this is the same Kevin Hart; huge disappointment. You won't be laughing, just in pain from boredom.  It's not even worth the price of a rental.",1327104000,2,175,4.46875
4885641,1,B005SHBO1Y,"This wasn't funny and I am a big Hart fan.  I didn't get a chance to see it in the movies (now I am glad I didn't), so I was anxiously waiting for this.  A lot of the material was very personal and I felt how painful it had been at one time so it's hard to see the humor in it.  I get that we must be able to laugh in order not to cry, I have definitely seen my part of life's woes, and can look at them differently as time passes, but it's nothing I want to laugh about.  The other material was just not funny at all. I mean the alright, alright, alright was catchy and all...

I will say that unlike a lot of celebrities out there, Hart does seem to keep it 100% whenever possible and seems like a genuinely cool person, and based off that I would give him 4 or 5 stars.  But unfortunately this review is for the movie, and that to me is a 1.",1327104000,2,844,3.7942857142857145
4885642,5,B005SHBO1Y,Truly one of the best comedians of our time and he's barely reached his prime! Kevin doesn't disappoint with Laugh At My Pain! Great to see how he incorporates his upbringing and family into his success. Recommended! Alright Alright Alriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight!,1327017600,,256,5.425

4885644,1,B005SHBO1Y,"I rented this movie from Redbox for exactly $1.28.  I wish I would have used that money to buy a bar of chocolate candy instead.  I love Kevin Hart, however this movie was horrible.  I only laughed maybe 45 seconds throughout his entire performance and movie.  Don't waste your money on this movie.  The only people that may find this movie somewhat entertaining are teenagers.  If you are over 21 then you  may not enjoy this boring movie.  His jokes were so dry to me.  I fell asleep watching this because it was sooo boring!  Don't waste your money.",1326931200,3,552,4.484848484848484

I have several of Kevin Hart's  DVD to include Seriously Funny and I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. So I really expected Laugh at my Pain to be just as good if not better. This time HE JUST WASN'T FUNNY. It started off with a documentary on his upbringing, the actual comedy show was not that long and after the comedy show it went into a short skit/movie with Kevin Hart and some other characters. ALSO NOT FUNNY. I fell asleep.  There were some funny moments in the stand up portion of the dvd but not that many. Don't get me wrong I love Kevin Hart but I wasn't feeling this one, I plan on returning this dvd and getting something else.",1326931200,4,740,4.204225352112676

4885647,5,B005SHBO1Y,"I can honestly say this is one of the funniest stand ups I have seen in a long time.  I couldn't stop laughing when Kevin was talking about his dad.  ""alright, alright, alllllllright"".  Hahahaha..........definitely not something to watch with the kids.  My 6 year old over heard it and he won't stop saying ""alright, alright, alllllllright"".  He thought it was so funny.  Glad I watched it on Comedy Central so some of it was edited.  I am definitely buying the DVD to watch when the kids are sleeping.  :)",1326758400,9,506,4.606741573033708

I also wanna support ""Chocolate Drop"", cuz he's a hard worker. He has been doing commercials, movies, comedy stand-up routines, etc. eBay has commercials with him on YouTube. Xbox has an add with him promoting Forza 4.  I wanna support his hard work.

He used to be my #2 fav Comedian behind Louis CK. Now he's my first.",1325030400,9,582,4.420560747663552
