I played double bass and like the rockabilly genre but won't sing so there was no chance we would ever get together.
I have watched countless heated discussions between the singer and guitarists in the last band I was in and thought I should know a little more about the singing and guitar sides. Seeing I owned the PA, I thought a more detailed knowledge would not go astray in matters of arbitration.
Another friend was doing local musicals with a group and they recommended she go to Rhonda for a general tidy up and that was how the divide was crossed.
Sorry to be so long winded but in general conversation with Rhonda, Franco Corelli's name and Tosca came up and I bought this for her birthday.
Five stars is Rhonda's review.",1358553600,,838,4.412903225806452
