7975414,5,B00007ELEH,"Best known for the recently restored ""Battle of Algiers"", ""Road"", director Pontecorvo's first feature, remains a stunning achievement. In this lyrical depiction of life's ambiguities, we feel no contempt for Montand's character, though he goes against the greater good by breaking the law: We simply see a man trapped in humble circumstances who breaks the rules to create a better life for his family. ""The Wide Blue Road"" is made indelible by its rich color cinematography and a nuanced, charismatic performance by Montand, one of the finest of his career.",1182902400,4,558,5.211111111111111
7975415,5,B00007ELEH,This is a great movie.  Beautiful views of the Italian sea and coast.  Great acting by Yves Montand and others.  A moving story of struggle and solidarity among poor fisherman.  An inspiring message about the possibilities of the downtrodden coming together and making a difference in their lives.  This is a great political movie that succeeds in moving and informing us without slipping into didactic preaching.,1090972800,3,413,5.196969696969697
