729410,5,6303905269,"This video is the best exercise/streching program I have ever used. It is easy and low key, but it works!!!!. Please Kathy Ireland put this out on DVD. My video player will not last forever. Very Exelent.",1344729600,2,204,4.54054054054054
729411,4,6303905269,I love this one! The exercises are in segments.  You can do one segment or combine them according to your needs and time constraints.  I have used only the stretching segment which I find to be a very calming alternative to yoga. The stretching segment is very thorough and targets all the major muscle groups in both upper and lower body and is a great stretch after a tough workout of lifting weights.  Each segmen has soothing background music.  I did notice improved balance and flexibility after a couple of weeks of using this workout.  I do plan to start using the breathing segment very soon since I recently learned of the benefits of proper breathing techniques in the reduction of stress and blood pressure. Each segment is approximately 10-12 minutes making it convenient to do in early A.M. or P.M. before bedtime. This is a definite worthwhile addition to my exercise DVD collection.,1341360000,,897,4.798701298701299
729412,5,6303905269,"i have had massages, chiropratic adjustments for tight(spasm) and painful muscles.

i bought kathys STRETCH vhs at Thrift Store, it does the trick, after doing the entire tape my muscles feel relax and the pain is gone.  these exercises can be done by almost anyone and  any age they are so simple and gentle.

For Me, these exercises are as effective as a neuromuscular massage.",1330041600,,379,4.7846153846153845
729413,5,6303905269,"I have been using this video for nearly 10 years to stretch and relax after a workout, or even just a hard day at work. Some parts of me are not very flexible and the stretches in this video are extremely easy to do and healthy for you (no bouncing.) There are different sections/segments in the video:
Breathing & Posture
Stretching
Upper Body Sculpting
Tensing & Relaxing
The music is not annoying and the set contains soft colors, fabrics and plants to make a good atmosphere. I would recommend this video to anyone who finds they are very tense at the end of the day. It is great to do before bedtime. I fall asleep easier and wake up more limber.",1313884800,2,651,4.3884297520661155
729414,5,6303905269,"Calling this a low-impact workout wouldn't be fair.  Although the program is not tough, it has an incredible impact on your exercize abilities as well as your every day life.  The workout is composed of four concentrated segments:  breathing, stretching, upper-body sculpting, and tension/relief stress reduction.  My personal favorite was the stretching, but every segment has a way of strengthening your muscles, posture, and breathing ability.

Like a customer mentioned below, the program is great for all ages, and older men and women can definitely join in, too.  It's a great program that you can do any time of the day.  Do it in the morning and it will get your day started right.  Do it in the afternoon and it will help you relax.  Do it about an hour before bed and you'll be able to wind down.

This program works great combined with the use of other exercise programs, such as aerobics, weight training, and resistance workouts (you don't have to do ""Reach"" back-to-back with any of them, but it gives you good pointers and techniques for more intense types of exercise).

I was surprised at how relaxed, yet stronger, I felt after the first time I did this exercise.  It's a great soft workout and I try to do it at least once or twice a week, if I have the time.  If this is something you might be interested in, get the video and try it out!!  You won't be disappointed!

Now, if only we can get a petition going to have the program released on DVD!",1202860800,6,1466,4.563218390804598

7855482,5,6303905269,"THE best  program I have ever used for stretching!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Wish I could find in DVD format!",1456531200,,106,4.3
7855483,5,6303905269,"As a few other reviewers noted, I've owned and used Kathy Ireland's ""Reach"" workout for many years. It's effective, makes you feel good, is pleasant to listen to due to her soothing instruction and friendly chat, and gives me more energy throughout the day when I use this in the morning  (likely due to the frequent reminders to breathe).  I wish Kathy and/or the distributor would consider releasing this in DVD format. It would be wonderful if Kathy would re-make this workout now, at her current age, but in the meantime, I own 3 copies and hope my VHS/DVD player lasts!  (I will copy the VHS to DVD myself one of these days : )",1452988800,,632,4.478260869565218
7855484,5,6303905269,"This is the best exercise video on the market! Combine this with Kathy's: Body Specifics, Reach, and Absolutely Perfect and you've got an entire weekly fitness program guaranteed to tone, trim, and drop pounds quickly! This DVD is where you begin though! Trust me, it's tough at first and you'll be lucky to get through the 30 minute aerobic section. But, that's okay. The measure of this program is to gradually modify and increase to the full workout. It takes about 8 to 10 sessions if you are not in shape, but don't give up and don't back down! It's modification that comes gradual. I lost 100 lbs in 1994 through 1995 when I was in my 20's. And, with running each day, I prepared well for Air Force Basic Training. Now, I'm in my mid-40's and I'm facing 50, and I am using this great DVD again to help me through losing 100 lbs.again. This tape gives me the confidence and routine familiarity to get there again (I am 300 lbs. now). Hang in there Amazon purchaser! This will do what you need it to!",1427673600,,1004,4.403225806451613
7855485,5,6303905269,"I was so excited to find my Kathy Ireland:  Reach video!  Her stress reduction and body strengthening video is a calming video that provides an excellent stretching routine and abdominal exercises.  I recommended it to my mom, who needs an alternative to Yoga.  My husband and I used to do this video about 15 years ago.  I look forward to doing this with my daughter this weekend!  Kathy Ireland is really motivating and an wonderful instructor!  I wish she would sell this as a DVD too!",1393027200,,488,4.604651162790698
7855486,5,6303905269,"My sister-in-law gave me this exercise tape and during the processing of rewinding it, it broke.  I had it set to where I could watch it as it rewound and was looking forward to using it (this would have been my first time).  I was so disappointed when it broke as it was ejecting!  I went immediately to Amazon's site and apparently ordered the last on in stock.  If this comes back into stock, I recommend it.  It uses a lot of isometric moves that you can use off and on thru the day.",1391731200,,487,4.138297872340425
7855487,5,6303905269,Okay...so I am trying to get back into shape and remembered this exercise video I used to do probably 11 years ago...I loved this work out...it's low impact but you can really feel it in your muscles when you're done. My only disappointment was that I couldn't find this on a DVD but I remain thankful that I found it at all. It's just what I needed to get up and moving without being intimidated as some other exercise videos can be.,1364515200,,434,4.304878048780488
7855488,5,6303905269,Both the tape and Kathy Ireland are very good.  Just what I need.  Now all I have to is use it more often.,1361836800,,106,3.5652173913043477
7855489,4,6303905269,"I was to hard doing the stretch the first time, and couldn't move for a couple of days.  I am still trying, but not as hard.  I think in the end, it will be great because it works every part of the body.",1359849600,,203,3.697674418604651
7855490,5,6303905269,"I have been using this video since I was in my 30s and love it. I'm in my 50s now and have pulled it out again to get me moving again. Whenever I use it, it makes me feel better physically and makes me want to go for a walk or do other exercises. I definitely agree with the others: Please make this available in DVD!!!!",1359504000,,320,3.8636363636363638
