5905091,4,B00EDR5N3A,"I got hooked watching the pilot.
The music is good and the trailers preceding the series are fantastic. At first I didn't really know what RWBY was.

Granted, the animation is sub par with room for improvement. But, from what I know of RoosterTeeth, they don't have much staff and they are making each episode probably 2 weeks ahead of the air date. Even with the advanced 3D animation programs available, there is only so much that a small group of people can do in a small amount of time. Plus, they have Red vs Blue their working on at the same time.

And, in my opinion, they really put in some dedication to the battle scenes which makes them super awesome! It closely makes up for the 'bland' episodes where the animation and acting is of poor quality.

There is a lot of puns and references to older folklore as seen with the characters' names and their weapons. I'd suggest going to the rwby wikia to draw the parallels of them all. Fan fiction, I don't think so. Major influence definitely.

Sadly, the episodes are so short that they don't even qualify for the 30-min slot for most cartoons on TV, aside from the pilot episode and episode 8 with the major battle against two Grim monsters. So, even including the as yet to be mentioned bonus material, I don't think it's worth buying a blu ray at the asking price, or even the DVD for that matter. My guess is that the bonus material would include the trailers and some behind-the-scene materials that would be more altogether than the episodes altogether.

Maybe I would considerate it if each version respectively was half the price. Maybe.",1382054400,4,1602,4.56794425087108
5905092,1,B00EDR5N3A,"Let me start this review by saying I'm a huge Roosterteeth fan. I've seen every episode of RvB, I've listened to a lot of their podcasts and seen every one of their Animated Adventures, and I still watch Achievement Hunter on a regular basis. But this series is just plain BAD. Like, REALLY bad. The animation looks like it was done by some five year old with a free demo for an animation software, the voice acting is amateurish, and the story is just bits and pieces of other anime stitched together incredibly poorly. And for those saying ""Oh, it's an amateur project, what do you expect?"", I know what Roosterteeth is capable of. I've seen them produce quality works, so I know that this show is capable of being great, the greatness just isn't there.

5905093,1,B00EDR5N3A,"The animation on this is horrific with lots of clipping and character models look like they were made with the same software that made reboot in the early 90s. The acting is atrociously bad and pandering to the ""lol so random"" types and there isn't a semblance of plot in the first 6 episodes. The comedy is god awful with jokes that just completely miss any kind of mark, there's no main villain yet, everything about this series seems like it's some kind of fanfiction, the people who made this series should be embarrassed an rooster teeth should be ashamed of this tripe. The other reviews giving this a 5 out of 5 have to be jokes, there's visual glitches and episodes with desynced audio this is as amateur as it gets and need to be avoided.",1381968000,25,747,4.45985401459854

5905104,2,B00EDR5N3A,"How can you even call this animation. It is some of the worst CGI I have ever sat through. At first glance it seems like it would be a great buy based on all the 5 star reviews., But I have to think that anyone who gives it 5 stars has no concept of art. Don't get me wrong, I have watched plenty of CGI in the past, But it is well done CGI. Final Fantasy, Beowolf, Blassreiter, and Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seekers comes to mind, as well as more recently the Netflix original Ajin. RWBY, however, doesn't even stand in the same league. It is devoid of any artistic emotion. I have seen better animation in the likes of older video games such as the original Mass Effect and Witcher on PC. Even the highly despised re-mastering of Ghost in the Shell, or more recently released series Str. A.In. were more fluid and dynamic in scope than this piece of cinematic garbage. Just take a look at the actual screen shot from the show and you will see my point. Now had this story been done with actual traditional animation styles or at the very least, upgraded CGI mapping and detail orientation, it could have been something special. Instead the developers chose to use a CGI technique that looks like it came from the dawn of civilization.... The music was great, and the acting, as well as the action sequences were decent, but again, all of that is lost on the animation making for a poor excuse of the genre. Also, the chapters themselves equate to nothing more than scene selections, which are so short, that you almost have no choice but to watch it in movie format. So disappointed with this, as this could have been so much more..... And yet fell so short of the mark as to make me ask only one question...""Why even bother in the first place""?.....",1461715200,7,1750,4.387692307692308

The animation is on the cheaper end of things(more so in the very beginning i.e. vol1) but it definitely improves on so many levels by season 2. Now strictly speaking in animation terms, as ""different"" & ""weird"" it may seem you can see that there's a LOT of work being put into this and it makes you want to enjoy it more, you can literally feel they're efforts. But what truly brings this show together to give you that hair standing, spine chilling experience is the amazing soundtrack perfectly in sync with the epic battle scenes. By far one of the most memorable shows in terms of music+fighting animation. The story is pretty solid, as their is tons of potential to where it can go & the characters are just starting out so theirs so much that can be told still.

5905124,5,B00EDR5N3A,"I saw this show listed on Netflix for a while, and had meant to give it a try. My wife watched a bit of the first episode and told me it wasn't very good, so I avoided watching it for a while. Then a good friend came over and told us that we HAD to watch this show, because it was so good. I was intrigued, and willing to give the show a chance.

I saw the first few minutes and thought it was a poorly animated, low-budget, generic show not really worth my time. But I'm open minded and patient, so I continued to watch the show. And as the show went on, I was shocked.

Everything a Teen-Aged Super-Powered Show Should Be

I've seen a lot of anime and cartoons in my time, and watched a lot of teen-aged super-hero stuff. Heck I'm even trying to write a superhero academy story myself (but that's another story). So when I tell you that this is the best story of this type I have ever seen, try to comprehend how many shows were inferior. Why is this show so good, and why does it rise to the top of the crowd of shows in this genre?

Welcome to Beacon Academy

The world of this show is one filled with evil monsters and defended by super-powered ""Hunters"". They get their powers from ""dust"", and naturally they all go to superhero school to learn how to do this.

Shows of this type tend to have lousy voice acting, superficial stories, flat characters, and be incredibly generic (generally failing to tell a story that feels compelling or involving) and certainly at this point we have all seen so many similar superheroes that every new superhero starts to feel incredibly generic (or even worse, yet ANOTHER interpretation of an old character without any of the charm or awesome backstory that made it a good character in the first place). That's what makes this show so refreshing. It isn't afraid to pile on the homages, the archetypes, the action and the drama, but at the same time there's an absolutely delicious blend of charm, wit, and innocence that's reminiscent of the very very stories ever told. You don't like these characters because they remind of something you used to like. You like these characters because although they are borrowed from classic fairy tale, anime, and comic book tropes, they make them all their own.

Homages or Rip-Offs, Stereotypes or Archetypes? A show or a movie?

Unlike seemingly EVERY other person writing reviews for this show (and liking it) I have NEVER watched anything by Rooster Teeth, nor had I ever even heard of them before now. I have never heard of the show's creator (I am sorry he died though). So all I can go off of is what I find as I watch the show. There are homages galore on this show. There is a main character who looks like Little Red Riding Hood, a girl whose bow looks like cat ears, a battle maiden robot, and a dog whose name is a number in German. These are no rip-offs. They are shout outs.

Every one of the main characters has a personality and backstory that you can see coming from a mile away. That does not, however change the fact that the characters are very well done and extremely likable. Their personality is thoroughly developed and very charming. Honestly, I think a lot of the people who complain about the characters simply don't understand the subtleties of this show. If character development is told through expression, though the food the character eats, and through the music that plays during scenes, this is not a sign of a poorly made show. It is simply the sign of one that has an introverted undertone that rewards persistence and determination, rather than exposition-bubble spelling-out of everything that many Americans are used to.

I didn't watch this show in the manner it was originally produced (a series of short episodes), but rather as two movies. While everyone seems to be complaining that the ""series"" isn't non-stop fight sequences, for a MOVIE, the pacing is just about perfect. There's action, romance, character development, and lots, and lots, and LOTS of character interaction that builds the world of the show and is incredibly enjoyable.

The style

Getting to the style of the show, while it certainly is low-budget (lack of detail on background characters in the first season), it is also very stylized, reminding my of some of the better cell-shaded polygons of some video games famous for their art style. It certainly won't wow for accuracy of physics when you look at the characters' walking movements (they kind of ""float""), but the emotion expressed in the main characters is fantastic, and the fights certainly do wow.

The Sincerity

My friend observed quickly while watching the show that while a monster was clearly decapitated, instead of a fountain of blood there were ""flutters"" or red rose petals. In the course of two seasons, I can't recall hearing a single swear word. My immediate reaction was one of confusion. Is this supposed to be a show for kids? The main protagonist is a young teen, so...maybe? But wait, everyone else is an older teen. The jokes and plot and structure of the show seem geared toward an older audience. But then...why no swearing and gore?

This is no flaw, in fact it's incredibly charming. All of the characters, and especially Ruby, are so incredibly sincere in everything they say and do, that it's impossible not to quickly fall in love with them. I quickly realized there was not a single main character I didn't like, and that's something I don't think has ever happened for me in any show I've ever seen. This is the real reason why this show is so good. You want to believe in the characters and are rooting for them all the way.

Why things will change

Forget about the great action, the low-budget beautifully-styled animation, and the fairy-tale monster-hunter trappings. What you have left is a the best thing since Sailor Moon and My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic. It's a show about young girls with a distinct personality, a strong mission in life, a quest of personal discovery, and wonderful interaction with each other. It isn't stereotypical. It's downright revolutionary in today's culture.

If anyone says these characters are flat and one-dimensional, I'm sorry, but they just don't get it. These characters are portrayed from the heart, and they constantly surprise you with things they say and do, and new dimensions of their personality. They learn, and grow. The ice queen realizes she needs to re-examine her view of life. The dragon protagonist intuitively comes to realize she needs to take charge. The goofball clueless idiot comes through in the aid of others. And the catgirl learns to trust and rely on her friends and deal with her past while the older sister digs into her own.

This show is a reconstruction of American animation and the magical-girl/high school girls/teen super-hero genres, and I KNOW that it is going to influence the future animation, particularly in the United States. The world needs more shows like this, and it's a massive breath of fresh air. I cannot wait for the third season. As it is...it's difficult not to get even more drawn in than I already am.

This show is not to be missed by anyone who appreciates anime, or any kind of animation in general. Just watch more than the first episode, as the first episode is NOT a good representation of the overall quality of the show.

P.S. The floaty cartoon physics remind me of Reboot!",1442707200,,7371,4.68522815158546

I finally watched the all of it yesterday and from the start I was hooked, great voice acting, great music, great story, great comedy, and topped off with amazing fight sequences. Overall I was extremely happy with this show and ran out to purchase the DVD. I was concerned because Netflix has a 2012 original air date so I thought it wasn't being continued, first thing I did after watching it was look it up online and thankfully that date isn't quite accurate and there's more to come in a few months. It's rare for me to be really taken in with any kind of entertainment, let alone animated, but RWBY has taken its place as an all time favorite for me.

You know how when you watch a show or movie and you say ""Well, if they had done this better.."" or ""If the Voice acting was better.."" Or ""Well, the story was good so the poor 'insert anything here' was tolerable""? Well I couldn't find one thing that wasn't handled perfectly, at least for my tastes.

I loved it from the trailers before there was anything else and it just kept getting better. I had to buy the Blu-Ray right away, not just to be able to watch it in one fluid movie, but also to support such an amazing universe and talented artists. What shines through the most is the battles these characters have. They are gorgeous and are alone with the money, not included the great humor and storyline.

5905161,5,B00EDR5N3A,"RWBY is the pretty great. Set in the wold of Remnant, we follow the story of Ruby Rose as she attempts to become a Huntress. They are the ones who protect the world from the creatures of Grim. Monsters that seek nothing more than mindless destruction. Along the way we meet up with her sister Yang, an heiress named Weiss and a loner named Blake. We follow their adventures with additional characters that can and will make you smile and laugh again and again.

The animation is something you don't see to often and is a treat to look at.

The soundtrack is PHENOMENAL and honestly great on it's own. Casey Lee Williams is fantastic.

All in all RWBY is a great show and it will only get better as time goes on.
Season 2 is just about to wrap up and I'd give it a 45 out of 10 so far. So there is that to look forward to.",1412726400,2,821,4.11875
5905162,5,B00EDR5N3A,"Big fan of Roosterteeth, fell in love with RWBY from episode 1, if you're really interested in this series and the characters, AND 2,  ( if you already enjoy the Roosterteeth's podcast/patch/know/screen play, OR if you're new to the series and company but enjoy listening to other podcasts/talk shows )....I highly recommend listened to the directors commentary and girls of RWBY commentary tracks, after watching the movie.

This series is Japanese Animation Inspired, and is not a high budget anime with a large crew working on the show, if you're on the fence about wether to buy this or not because you've never seen it, I invite to watch them on their website, www.roosterteeth.com or youtube.com where it is free to watch, and decide if you enjoy the artwork style and animation style.

Also news posted that there will be an official japanese dub of rwby",1408752000,2,861,4.883561643835616
5905163,4,B00EDR5N3A,"So the show has a rough start... and Jean is pitiful.  But the rest of the cast is surprisingly well written, voiced and executed, and play very well off each other.  The humor can miss the mark, but more often than not it hits, and seems to be hitting more frequently as the writers find their stride.  The odd visual style may take some getting used to as well, but they do some great things with it.

I bought this Blu-ray as soon as I saw Monty Oum in the credits.  His Dead Fantasy web series is excellent and available free, so I felt like I owed him as much.  But interestingly enough, though Dead Fantasy was all about fight choreography, I find myself watching RWBY for the dialog and character interactions/dynamics.  The fights are still good, particularly when Nora's sledgehammer/rocketlauncher is involved, but they're not quite up to best of Dead Fantasy (eg Tifa vs. anything).

So even though at worst it may come off as a cheap and awkward amateur effort by anime fanboys lacking in originality (eg Glinda Goodwitch), I'd venture to say that if you're bothering to read this review, you'll probably learn to love it.  If you're able to see past some issues, it's just a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  I'm following season 2 is on Crunchyroll, but you can also stream it on RoosterTeeth's website.  That said I'll buy season 2 as soon as it's out.  I need Monty Oum and RoosterTeeth to keep making fun projects like this.

Also, the music is superb.  Watch the Yellow and Red trailers for a sense of this.",1408406400,,1523,4.490909090909091

5905169,5,B00EDR5N3A,"So, few things out of the way first:  Love the action, love the music.

In addition to just enjoying watching the series, to me RWBY is also really important as an exciting new development in Anime overall.  Let me explain why.  While there are some cliche's which keep RWBY true to an anime action / super power genre there are also several cliche's they don't keep to.  No panties flash or characters working part time in a maid cafe here and the acting, while sometimes sounding naive, does not attempt to replicate the anime baby girl talking adults or hyper exaggerated expressions of a sit com.  If anything I really am liking the clean dialogue that feels free of the needs to keep to those unnatural constraints.

The art style may take some getting used to.  It's not quite as jarring as ink blots used for every cut-scene or an unnecessary wallpaper-like screen over everything, but the high contrast color choices with lack of background details may be too much for some.

Next, the girl characters while attractively drawn don't present themselves as overly clumsy or overly cute.  They kick butt well, because they kick butt and don't apologize for it even a little.  For these reasons I give RWBY an extra star, though I do share the thoughts that the episodes are a little short, and the pacing seems awkward at times.  The biggest standard I wish they'd adhere to is episode lengths of at least 23 minutes.  It feels we are being ""Hobitted"" (when you take a single short book and turn it into 9 hours of film) a little.  Still, I look forward to every episode.",1406332800,,1576,4.602150537634409

5905172,5,B00EDR5N3A,"If I have to explain it, then you probably wouldn't understand.  But seriously, the music and story line are such that it's a really good story with character development along the way.  There are some minor things that some people would find problematic but the animation is pretty good considering,",1405814400,,300,4.98

5905175,5,B00EDR5N3A,"Amazing! At least if you don't mind short episodes. It is really a lot better than what you would expect from something of this calliber. Graphics aside, it has a very good and compelling story that really suck you in, and I' eagerly awaiting volume 2!",1404864000,,252,4.5
5905176,5,B00EDR5N3A,"This was a fun watch. The plot is inspired by various anime it fits that mold pretty well.

The animation reminds me of a video game cutscene. It's not the greatest during a lot of the show, but the action scenes make up for it. High impact and fast, often looking like a beat down in a high quality fighting game. There is a noticeable improvement in quality during these scenes.

Humor is cute and got me chuckling a few times, voice acting is decent, but not pro level either. It's charming enough that it's forgivable.

The soundtrack is decent as well. It also includes four trailers, which are actually better than any of the individual shows. Each has one of the principal characters in an action sequence. The show has moments like those, but there is a lot of other stuff in between and none of the action sequences so far are as long or impressive as the ones in the trailers.

This can be watched for free on the internet, but I like having a copy for convenience and it won't be available that way forever.

I recommend checking it out online first because you can watch all of it before buying, but also recommend supporting it if you enjoyed it as much as I did. The Blu-ray is nice and well put together.",1404777600,,1219,4.376106194690266
5905177,5,B00EDR5N3A,"A very unique series from rooster teeth.  You can also visit their web site to see what this series is like.  Some people do not like the cell shaded animation style but I think it fits this series wonderfully!  The emphasis on color in this is a great mechanic too.  The disk DOES include the intro trailers for the four main characters (although the packaging did not state it) which is awesome!  Watch those first then watch the movie.  The movie is also a series of episodes played in order but it still feels very fluent in its story and all the episodes are continuations so there is no ""filler"" episodes.

The moment I got to the main menu and heard the song, it sent chills up my spine of how good it was.  ""Red like roses, part I"" and the rest of the soundtrack will not disappoint, high octane songs and heartfelt songs to be found alike.  I found myself attached to a lot of the characters, they have depth and can be funny, serious, sad, happy, etc.  The action was also incredible.  Better than scenes of two people screaming at each other piling up power and letting it go in one blast, RWBY put thought behind their action and show you the fluent moves of the character, all this while making it very fast paced.  The weapons they use usually have multiple purposes and the characters use their weapons in a multitude of ways.  I am not knocking the Katana ninja slicer, but this is a refreshing view on combat!",1404604800,,1426,4.396946564885496

5905179,3,B00EDR5N3A,"Rooster Teeth has created a new gem here. While I wouldn't consider it a perfect anime, it has its charm. The strength of this show lies in the four lead characters and their connection. The choice of voice actors is what gives me pause in the series. A old teacher being voiced by a much younger man is hard to listen. There isn't Fan-Service but Anime-Service, using styles from Japanese animation occasionally to satisfy those wanting it. This does not work for me as it forces a cliche all over again. It wants to be fresh, but bows to fan expectations.",1402099200,,557,4.524752475247524

For those of you who are interested in RWBY but are hesitant just to buy it right off the bat from amazon. This whole movie/ show is available on youtube in chapters/episodes. Note that this isn't a big budget animated movie, it all started out as a youtube series so the voice acting is good but not stellar. However don't let that deter you from watching this amazing show. The characters are fun and their personalities are great! The series is only going to keep getting better with each season.

5905231,5,B00EDR5N3A,"RWBY (Ruby) is a stellar beginning for the team over at Rooster Teeth, lending their resources and creative talent to the wizard of motion-cap fast-paced CGI-combat/anime, Marty Oum.

Marty's prior work impressed Rooster Teeth so much, they hired him on staff.  With his choreography and animation talents, they helped breathe life back into Red vs. Blue, their flagship series, which had been starting to limp after the Season 5 finale.  Marty approached the staff and asked if he could devote time to his own pet project, which turned out to be RWBY.  The staff obviously agreed, and we now have this very promising series to enjoy!

It combines CGI with smooth cell-shading to give the 'living cartoon' look that has become popular as of late.  The animation is relatively smooth, the colors are bright, vibrant and varied.  The work is simply amazing to look at, even in simple static scenes where little is actually happening.

The story is a little Harry Potter, a little Final Fantasy, and a smidge of Fairy Tales.  Some aspects of the world of RWBY are technologically very advanced, while some portions are magically imbued.  It's a blending of the best bits of both worlds, which makes for some extremely amazing combinations, both in the characters, their powers/ablities, and their weapons of choice.

Without revealing major plot points, Season 1 is the starting point, and thus, a large portion of the series is devoted to the task of introducing key characters, having them interact, showing us their personality quirks and establishing these relationships, to draw on in future seasons.  While this would be fine normally, if you happen to stumble across the four color-coded 'Trailers' for RWBY, you will see that they are NOTHING but action-packed, kickass anime fight scenes...and thus, that's what you will expect when you walk in.  Again, anyone who has seen Monty's prior works of ""Haloid"" or ""Dead Fantasy"" will also expect the same.  While there is some fair amount of combat, it seems to be at about a 65/35 ratio of conversation and character development at this point.  Please, don't let the trailers fool you into thinking this is a constant Dead Fantasy scenario where hot chicks fight all day long and never complain about their home lives.  It's more the opposite:  They go to school, talk all day, then get to fight monsters for a bit.

This is NOT a downer, or short-selling the show...it's just something you need to be aware of, expectations-wise.  It's completely necessary to develop the characters, so we CARE about what happens to them, and RWBY excels at that.  Each has their own layer of complexity and mystery to them, which invests you more as time goes on.  Each character is VERY different from the others, and you are constantly gambling one against the other in your head to try and figure out what will happen here or there, or there..but the plot is not necessarily very predictable (which is GOOD).

The voice acting is top-notch.  Amateur, pro...who cares?  They sell the roles.  You laugh at the goofy bits, you completely believe their sincere tones, you genuinely feel their angst over some parts. The actors deliver, and in droves.

The music is perhaps the most stellar portion of the entire experience.  Go buy the soundtrack, and put it on repeat.  You'll be hooked JUST BY THAT ALONE.  Then watch the show.  Listen how at key moments you'll hear that one trigger stretch of music that identifies with Weiss come up, or a hint of RWBY's main theme flitter about in the background, right before a major killing blow.  Fantastic themes, music, and songs.  Whether it be incidental music during a school scene, or bass-kicking rapid-fire techno during a monster fight, the soundtrack gives you its all, and you're stunned that this came from Rooster Teeth.  They've raised the bar with this one.

All in all - You will love RWBY.  It's American-anime with great action, good plot development, and some absolutely stellar fight scenes, with a handful of laughs mixed in along the way.  And this, is just the FIRST SEASON. All of this development is going to pay off in some major ways along the next few season arcs, so get in on the ground floor, and tell your friends.  This series is going to only grow and grow, and continue to excel.  Imagine what they can do next season, after watching this work.  Wowza.",1385510400,7,4366,4.840755735492578
5905232,4,B00EDR5N3A,"I would have to come clean and say I ordered this item before ever hearing about it.  I buy a lot of anime on Amazon so when it popped up in my recommendations I read the synopsis and ordered it.  I've always been a rooster teeth fan but had no idea they were the creators of this show until I watched it.  Sometimes I just like to take a chance and try something new.  That being said I thought the series was very well done although it leaves the viewer with a lot to be desired.  The animation is very different yet interesting.  There is some graphic clipping but I'm sure it will be cleaned up quite a bit in future seasons.  The voice acting is done by people new to the industry but hell, ya gotta start somewhere right?  Besides they don't sound half bad at all in my book.  The action sequences are beyond amazing!  The music though...probably the best thing about the series from the intro all the way through to the ending.  Overall this show is far from being a masterpiece, however given the show's potential I can see it becoming a great work of art.",1385078400,,1064,4.27
5905233,1,B00EDR5N3A,"This is a show for Roosterteeth fans only. And even then, you need to be a ""Shut Up And Take My Money!"" Roosterteeth fan to want to pay for this show. Normally I would advise everyone else to wait a few years and buying a box set of 3+ seasons, but there's a Catch-22 at play here, unfortunately - if enough people decide to skip buying this show, this show won't go on for much longer. But if the show doesn't go on for another few seasons it won't have a chance to get better. And this show certainly needs to get better.

The biggest problem I have with this show is the Writing. If you've been following it online (and on forums outside of Roosterteeth) you may read that people hate the animation or that they hate the voice acting or that they hate the anime cliches, all of which are valid criticisms but also very subjective. I don't have a problem with the animation or the anime cliches (though they don't have a positive influence on my opinion of the show), and the voice acting is consistently terrible, which makes it easier to ignore it. I see the voice acting as now ""This character sounds like a dweeb even though they're supposed to be tough and intimidating."" and I ignore it.

But the writing is atrocious. The character development is abysmal - it took 15 episodes to actually give some characterization to one of the main characters and one of the other main characters hasn't been developed at all, while there are secondary characters who have entire episodes devoted to them. (one of which as their own two part episode) Episodes vary in length from 5min to 13min - and these are the middle episodes, the ones that are between the Premiere and the Finale, which you expect to be longer. Episodes are woefully inconsistent in their stories;regularly it seems as if the story just pauses at the end before being picked up in the next as if the end of the episode is actually a commercial break, and in 3 min you're going to go on to the next part. (this might actually be less of a problem on a Blu Ray, since you can go on to the next episode in a minute or two, unlike watching it week to week where you have to wait an entire week for the next episode) The Antagonists are introduced in the first episode, then make maybe 2 more appearances before the finale, and their relevance to the entire plot is unclear.

Which is appropriate because the plot is unclear. It's difficult to tell what the show wants to be about, as it shifts from one focus to another focus to another focus before coming back to the original focus, but without any development of why that focus is important it becomes just an excuse to show off the powers of new characters and have a fairly exciting final battle scene. But from a narrative standpoint it makes little sense.

It's a shame because there appears to be quite a bit interesting that could be going on. The setting is interesting and has a great deal of potential, the characters have strong potential - yes, they all seem to be strong Cliches but they have enough potential that they could be taken somewhere interesting. So I hope that there are enough Roosterteeth ""Shut Up And Take My Money!"" fans that buy this regardless of any 1 star rating, that Roosterteeth keeps going with it but steps in to fix the problems. And that they take the time to read reviews like this and take these reviews to heart, make improvements to the show and make the show better.",1384560000,29,3426,4.441971383147854
5905234,4,B00EDR5N3A,"First off, here's what's on the DVD:

***Watch as movie
***Scene selection
***Watch by episode (actually no different than scene selection). Also note that the DVD is split into ""chapters"" instead of episodes (the format that it's in online). For example, episodes 4  & 5 (The First Step part 1 and 2 ) online are instead combined into a single chapter on the DVD.
***More from Rooster Teeth (previews of other RT products/shows such as Fails of the Week, Slo Mo Guys, etc). Nothing new basically.
***Special Features. This includes:

+++Director's Commentary (with Monty, Kerry, and Miles). Monty is the creator of the show, Kerry and Miles are directors/writers for the show (although Miles voices Juane as well)
+++Cast Commentary (with Lindsay, Kara, Arynn, and Barbara who voice Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang)
+++RWBY Cosplay (2.5 mins of 4 cosplayers talking about cosplaying)
+++Behind the Scenes (7 mins. Not that different from what you see from interviews they do)
+++Fan Art (4 mins. Miles and Kerry just talking about how appreciative they are of some fan art they get. They show a bunch of fan art on screen)
+++All 4 Trailers

I DID NOT find any closed captioning, which is a major letdown. Anyway, I felt as if the only thing worthwhile about the DVD was the cast and director's commentaries. If you're looking to buy the DVD for the special features, I'd advise against it (go to youtube and download all the episodes instead if you want).

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SPOILERS AHEAD. On to my actual opinion of the show:
I want to start by saying I think it's a tremendous effort to make this kind of show with the limited resources Rooster Teeth has. A lot of people note the episodes length and animation issues (like choppy animation/movement or how all the background characters are blackened into silhouette) as major problems. I disagree. Background characters are so unimportant that the first 10 episodes basically are the first 2 days of school and the rest of the season time skips months into the future (so you never really get to see their school environment/interaction with people other than TEAM CRDL, which could have been great). Episode length is also not a major issue considering you should have known what you were getting into and that ep1, 8, 15, and 16 are ""full length"".

What does bother me is RWBY's lack of intrigue/difficulty setting itself apart from other animes/shows.

PROS:
(1) I do love the characters so far, especially Ruby, Pyrrha, Nora, and Penny. Not so much (personally) with Weiss (who we should be sympathetic towards but just keeps being bitchy/says things that really turn you off), Juane (who's idea of doing things himself includes sleeping in class, worrying his team mates, and treating Pyrrha like s*** until Cardin pretty much forces his hand), or TEAM CRDL.
(2) The fight scenes are amazing (as expected of Monty - if you're not familiar with his worth, check out Red vs Blue season 8, 9, 10, Dead Fantasy, and Haloid). However, there are only fight scenes in episode 8 and 16 pretty much. People may even say that the 4 trailers to the show are better than entirety of the show so far (in terms of action) and I wouldn't really disagree with that.
(3) The voice acting (remember that many of these girls/guys are NOT professionals and are doing their first ever VA job here). The voice actor for Roman Torchwick, Professor Ozpin, and the narrator from episode 1 are the pros. Everyone else is new to it and has another job at Rooster Teeth anyway (except the VA for Blake).
(4) Some moments of the show have great meaning behind them. For example, what everyone is eating in the cafeteria tells you about their character (Ruby is eating cookies only, Weiss is eating only one apple, Pyrrha is eating a large salad, and Juane has a bunch of stuff on his plate). In episode 8, Yang picks the ""knight"" chess piece because ""it's like a pony"". Nora picks the chess piece of a rook (the  chess piece that looks like a castle) similarly for a superficial reason (because she wants to be ""Queen of the castle""). On the other hand, the two team leaders pick their chess pieces maybe for more meaningful reasons. Ruby picks the ""knight"" because a knight is the most idealized figure (like a knight in shining armor), which is maybe something she wants to be (a hero). Juane picks a rook because castles are sturdy, reliable, and a place to fall back to/seek shelter, maybe something he wants to embody as well.
(5) The music. ESPECIALLY because of the lyrics for each song tell a lot about the character that the show itself hasn't gotten to. I mean...a lot hasn't been revealed, so much so that the BACK OF THE DVD says that the name of the world the show is set in is called Remnant (something NEVER mentioned in the show). You will feel disappointed in how little you have learned so far. For example, who Ruby mourns for or why the moon is the way it is is not revealed yet.

CONS:
(1) Focus. What I mean is what they choose to focus on. After orientation and the first day of school (the Emerald Forest), the second day of school is focused on the Ruby/Weiss conflict (resolved by a professor just telling Weiss her attitude sucks). If you thought that story arc was tedious and was happy it was over, it shifts to the Juane/Cardin conflict and then after that to end the season is the Weiss/Blake conflict. A lot of people may not like this kind of format at all, especially if they feel like we're supposed to be responding to heavy character moments/development when we're not even that familiar with a character to begin with (for example Blake). A lot of people may be turned off by the fact that so much ""character development"" is done under so much tension. Someone asked Monty when they will be getting into the backgrounds of the characters and he said that you need ""story before you have backstory"", similarly, you should have some established character before you have character development. You can disagree with that, it's your opinion but what is jarring is that some of that conflict is forced/doesn't make sense. For example, Ruby poofs out of nowhere to leave Weiss alone in the Emerald Forest surrounded by enemies. Weiss stares straight ahead for several moments and charges straight forward. Ruby suddenly appears right in front of her for some reason and Weiss has to deflect her attack...why the heck would Ruby appear in front of her? She could have gotten stabbed! This scene seems like it was only there for them to argue about it later. Weiss and Blake have a major argument about The White Fang, which is ""settled"" in the last episode by basically Weiss saying she doesn't want to hear it as long as Blake is no longer a part of the White Fang anymore...but that doesn't settle the initial argument they had about the White Fang being lunatics/scum. Weiss tells the group her friends/family were KILLED by White Fang members so it's weird just to see her in the end say she doesn't care what Blake did in the White Fang in the past as long as she's not a part of it anymore.

Other small scenes make little sense as well. Like how in episode 8, Weiss is falling from riding the Nevermore with Ruby...now why the heck would that be a problem at all for her? One of her sword abilities allows her a platform in the air! That technique is seen in her trailer and in several episodes (even later that same episode)!!! She was also riding that thing for a while so she had time to think about it as well...
Other things may simply just be uncertain, like how Glynda Goodwitch couldn't take down a single plane in episode 1 while she is a huntress but Penny could take down 3 (it seems quite easily).

(2) The conflict/tension may also turn a lot of people off because of the ages of the characters. Everyone in the school is basically in College/University (dorms, lecture halls, etc) but a lot of people in the show still act like they are in middle school. I don't know. This could just be a personal thing though. For example, I liked Ruby and Blake's conversation about Ruby wanting to be a hero and Blake reading about a man with two souls, struggling for control over his body. But that's simply my preference. I'd rather see character INTERACTION like that (to build character) before I actually see character development. For example, I wonder how Nora would be like during finals week when everyone is tired from studying but she may still be all hyper energy like we've seen her? I don't know.

(3) There are just a lot of uncertain things and many things yet to be revealed. This just may frustrate some people. Consider that even in the second to last episode, they are still introducing characters and even by the end of the show, a lot of the songs of the characters tell just as much about those characters than the entire first season has (listen to Red like Roses part 2 for example).

It's a good show though. I enjoy it. I simply list the cons because we are paying $15 for essentially a season of a show that's time equivalent to about 5 episodes for a traditional half hour show. I'm thinking about our money's worth here. It is definitely worth it just watching it online. Getting a DVD, I'm not that sure of that recommendation.",1384387200,20,9325,4.684981684981685

5905242,4,B00EDR5N3A,"Rwby's Pros out way it's cons and it's only getting better.
Overview,

Music:Top notch, Jeff Williams delivers and even if you despise everything else it's soundtrack is incredible.

Action: Monty Oum's bread and butter and it shows. Excellent fight choreography and clearly Monty and the laws of physics had a falling out at some point because Rule of Cool is in full effect and it's all the better for it.

Story: So far, nothing we haven't seen before, school for fighting monsters, creatures of darkness, If you are into any type of fiction then you've seen the premise. That said, it's way to early to be certain of where it may go and with multiple seasons confirmed there is ample time for them to subvert there premise or introduce more original plots. Also, it needs to be said that even if they don't do that, not having an original premise is NOT automatically a bad thing. If it's executed well that's all that matters.

Animation: Needs work, outside of fight scenes it tends to be awkward and objects tend to clip. Lip sync needs work but has gotten better from the first episode. If it follows the pattern RVB did then we can probably expect to see them improve over time.(Compare RVB Season 8's CGI to Season 10's)

Voice Acting: Better then the Black and Yellow trailers would have you believe, much better, but not perfect, most of the principal cast are new to voice acting so there delivery can be somewhat stiff and lack emotion, but again from the trailers to episode 1 to episode 8 you can hear the improvements.

Overall: it still needs work, but know new show doesn't. Flaws in animation and some amateurish voice acting don't take away from the Incredible music, awesome action and so far, a likeable cast of characters. It will fix what is not great in time and like I said its already only getting better.",1382832000,52,1833,4.624615384615384
5905243,4,B00EDR5N3A,"Rwby seems to get a lot of attention from individuals who are fans of either Rooster Teeth or those who enjoy anime. The action sequences are amazing which isn't surprising given Monty Oum's involvement. The music for the series or at least the released songs are in my opinion the best music Rooster Teeth has released. The show gets a lot of crap for the animation style or the character portrayal. Personally neither of those bother me though. The animation style is sub par by most individual's standards but the show isn't going for realistic or high tech displays. It is made in a very rounded and cartoonish style but its still high quality of that style. I think some people tend to forget that shows and especially animation carry a level of art or how they want to be seen to the table and this shows style simply isn't for everyone. The character portrayal issues I can get behind a bit more. The dialogue can be cheesy at times and some of the characters seem rather flat but I can get past that with the more developed characters.

So the action and music are solid, personally I also enjoy the art style, characters leave a little to be desired at times, and as some other reviewers mentioned some of the episodes can be a bit bland. Ultimately I think the series would be better done as a movie or full length show with fewer episodes. I enjoy the show and I'll be buying this since I enjoy it and also to support Rooster Teeth. If you aren't sure about the show or whether or not to buy this watch it online first. They have it on Crunchy Roll, Youtube, and Rooster Teeth's site. The pilot is good, episode 8 is my favorite so far for action, episode 10 is probably the best display of good character portrayal/development, and I'm looking forward to the Volume 1 finale which will probably be on Nov. 7th as it should be another long episode like 8 and probably have some good action.",1382745600,21,1901,4.446991404011461

If you want a dark but funny anime taking place in a world ravaged by monsters and war where every character is based off a story then this is the show for you. First few episodes are light hearted but it gets more serious as it progresses.",1504742400,,278,4.264150943396227
