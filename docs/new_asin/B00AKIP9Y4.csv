5447118,1,B00AKIP9Y4,"When I saw that Louis Gossett, Jr. and Charles Durning were in it, I figured I'd give a try.  Reminds me of the dogs that Michael Caine appeared in because he needed money and as he said..they paid me.

The ignorance about race horses and training is absurd and inexcusable...  he has a filly with a bad leg and the next thing he does is not just jog her, but give her a fast trip at racing speed...  why not just shoot her and get it over with.  The number of mistakes, well, I lost count after awhile.  The storyline is lame, it seems that not just the horse has that problem, and we still never learn what the heck motivation is behind the bad guy's grudge.  Even jerks need a reason to hate someone.

There was a good story to be told here, too bad the script writer never figured out how to tell it.  And for the record...  you don't RIDE  harness horses, you DRIVE them.  And you sure as heck don't let them canter around when in harness...  if they don't trot or pace they are disqualified in a race, so you certainly don't let them learn bad habits while in harness.",1406505600,5,1074,4.180487804878049

5447123,1,B00AKIP9Y4,"I hate when a movie leaves you hanging as this one so blatantly did.  The storyline as a whole was okay, but I was left wondering why the trainer was training anymore and wondering what the whole story was with the guy that was arrested.  Very disappointing!",1398816000,,258,4.468085106382978

5447126,5,B00AKIP9Y4,"This was the best movie, I watched it over and over, it had it all...I loved the story about healing after a loss, also the bond between Rainbow the horse and Shannon was powerful, I can relate to that bond, with my own animals, i LOVED the birth mother her character was warm and wonderful,,,all the characters where wonderful and great actors, there was nothing i didn't like about this movie, except the part where Rainbow was claimed in a claims race by a horrible horse trainer Mitchel and well the condition the horse came back was very sad, but healing thru love of Rainbow from shannon was heartwarming...so I LOVED THIS MOVIE, it also was recvd quickly......the only part that might upset younger people was where Rainbow wasn't treated nicely by the horrible Mitchell",1390780800,3,777,4.762962962962963

5447134,5,B00AKIP9Y4,"This is an outstanding, heart-warming movie for the whole family and those who love horse racing.  I am, however, wondering why there is NO recognition of JASON GEDRICK, who most definitely had a major role in this movie...and did a fine job, I might add.  He's not mentioned in the star line-up on the front of the DVD, nor in any description of this movie.  I've been a huge fan of Jason Gedrick's since I first saw him in ""Dare To Love"", so shame on the promoters of Amazing Racer for not recognizing this fine actor.",1378684800,4,520,4.395833333333333

5447137,4,B00AKIP9Y4,"This movie about a girl who finds out her mother is alive, after her father's death. This movie is an example of how the circumstances can change anybodies life's from one day to the other.  It is movie about the value of truth, hard work, family and real friendship.",1372636800,,267,4.448979591836735
5447138,5,B00AKIP9Y4,"This movie has some of the classic elements of a ""horse"" movie, but at the same time some substance that makes it a movie of its own.  A young girl finds out after her father dies that she has a Mother.  A real and live one, not one who died in childbirth like her Dad told her.  Naturally, there is shock on both sides.  And while she and her Mother try to make things work at least for a summer trial period, they do still both have adjustments to make.  Enter into the picture her Mother's boyfriend's horse farm and a special horse that only the girl can get to race well.  Unfortunately, there is a rival horse farm with a spy in their midst.  And they pick up the filly in a claims race only to proceed to beat her and mistreat the poor horse.  However, through the eventual rehabilitation of the horse with a trainer named Max, all turns out well.  The movie leaves one feeling refreshed and happy.  Which is a pleasant and rare feeling nowadays.  So I recommend this movie highly.  It only has one mild swear word in it.  So it is suitable for family viewing.",1371168000,16,1067,4.248756218905473
5447139,2,B00AKIP9Y4,This has to be one of the most unrealistic movies about harness racing I have ever seen.  It is a fairly tale.  Anyone involved in the sport would find it laughable.,1370995200,2,165,4.290322580645161
5447140,5,B00AKIP9Y4,"We used this video for the youth group in the church,  They enjoyed it very much.
I have owned and used horses to work with the youth.  It is amazing when one cannot
