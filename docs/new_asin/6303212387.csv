599357,4,6303212387,Although a somewhat bizarre concept linking live action with animation including various battles with Nazi submarines and Mr. Limpet this classic 60's film is sure to please any child. The animation of Don Knotts as a fish with glasses is priceless.,980208000,,249,5.097560975609756

599640,5,6303212387,"Poor Mr. Limpet (Don Knotts) is a bookkeeper with delusions, he wants to enlist in the war effort but is rejected as 4-F due to his faulty eyesight and problems with equilibrium.  They don't want my blood either.  To console himself, he daydreams about becoming a fish.  He has an obnoxious friend (Jack Weston as George Stickle) who has designs on Limpets wife (Carole Cook as Bessie).  She barely restrains her fascination for the boorish George and her contempt for her husband and his hobby of keeping fish as pets.  They force Limpet to have a picnic at Coney Island.  He falls off the pier and seemingly drowns.  Instead of dying, he changes into a cartoon fish and swims off to join the war effort as a secret weapon for the navy, helping them to torpedo Nazi U-boats.  He finds romance and a better friend in a surly crab (Paul Frees as Crusty).

I suppose there was a moral to this story but it got lost in the silly songs and the ear shattering Limpet-Thrum.  Oddly enough, this is one of my favorite films featuring Don Knotts.  It isn't Disney, but they tried.",1506211200,,1072,4.5025906735751295

599712,4,6303212387,"I used to see this movie every so often on local TV.  It was normally aired in the summer and fall, and usually in the afternoon when lots of kids could see it.  It is animated and skews towards a children's demographic, but has enough for more patient adults to watch.

It's not an uproariously funny film, bur more amusing entertainment that'll kill an hour and a half.

The bluray has some special features regarding the promotion of the film.  I think the one unfortunate, and ironically enough perhaps fortunate aspect, is the fact that Don Knotts himself is rather elderly when he does the interview for the special edition.  As such the questions for his interview are as brief as his answers, and his comments on the other actors are also very brief.  Whether he wasn't a good interview or didn't like being interviewed, I cannot say, but his answers are non-expansive, and his age seems to be on the verge of catching up to him as a public figure.  But, he does put on a smile and give some brief anecdotes about the making of the film.

Truth be told I hadn't seen this film since the mid to late 80s, but growing up in the Bay Area and with a lot of science and coastal or ocean oriented society, it left a kind of impression on me as being a unique film dealing with a naval threat in the second world war.

All in all it's decent entertainment, a little silly at times, but innocent enough and may have a few PG-13 moments in it that'll have the adults grinning.

Give it a shot.",1504310400,,1492,4.350180505415162

He falls off a pier, turns into a fish, and then helps the Navy win the war against the Nazi's by locating their submarines.  The bluray was very clear/colorful and the sound was good.

But it is a wonderfully delightful film.  Admittedly, that is biased from the POV of one who likes to swim so much, he can easily imagine life being better (cooler) as a fish.

OK, so for those of you still reading, the movie is kitschy.  And unbelievable in so many ways, but it is fun.  The animation, but today's standards in lame, but it is fun.  And there hasn't been a better crab-side-kick then Crusty.

Don Knotts is a hero, both as a comic, as an American, and as a fish.",1400716800,,606,4.076271186440678

Not the typical Boy and Girl, but really a man coming to terms with loving himself and finding himself quite able to contribute to making he world a better place.... even if it's as a fish.  The wonder of all this enchanted me as a child and I highly recommend it for families, although it does take place during WW2 and has such elements as battleships, submarines, bombing the enemy and war-room talk.  Even Crusty (the curmudgeonly hermit crab) finds friendship, acceptence and empowerment!",1397952000,,522,4.777777777777778

Bowling for Movies Score - 245.625 of 300 - a true gem of a silly movie!

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

If you don't enjoy Simply Silly Films (or SSFs) well, you've got no call to go any further - this movie is a Super Simply Silly Film (SSSF!! Which constitutes an entire extra `S' over other less `S' films, so assume what you must from that uncomplicated fact) -  don't even bother to read on.  Now, if like The Movie Dude, you don't mind walking on the silly side of life with no other hope than simply being entertained without the bother of having to think - then by all means read on!

What's this SSSF about?
Don Knotts takes you on a mad-capped underwater adventure in this classic 1964 farce about a patriotic bookkeeper who is deemed unfit for duty due to his poor eyesight and stickman-like physique during the days preceding WWII.  Mr. Limpet retreats from his rejection into his lifelong hobby - fishkeeping - a hobby his wife detests.  When a friend drops by on leave from the Navy, they all take a trip down to Coney Island where this mild mannered man wishes so hard to become a fish that the unthinkable happens - he gets what he asked for!  Silliness ensues and The Incredible Mr. Limpet makes new friends, finds he has a special talent, and enlists in the armed services as a Nazi U-Boat spotter...  can a man turned fish turn the tide of war?

What a delightful ride into the obtuse with the master of all things nervous, Don Knotts.  Warner Brothers did an incredible job stitching together animation and live action seamlessly.  The story is as silly as it gets but children (and people who are children at heart) can easily get lost in the beautiful underwater world.

What we loved!
The sequences which featured real people interacting with the animated critters were done incredibly well - the actors appear to be looking directly at Mr. Limpet and considering this movie was done in '64 there were no ""CGI-wizards"" to smooth out the rough spots - they had to just get it right!

A good natured family flick that's easy to watch; although I have seen quite a few reviews saying the film was a big bore for adults I would have to respectfully disagree - while I did watch with Little Miss Movie Dude we both enjoyed the film together
I admit I may have a bias - I too have been a lifelong aquarist and have wished more than once to be a fish and enjoy the spectacle of the underwater world :]

What we didn't like:
When I asked Little Miss Movie Dude she replied, ""uhh, uuhhhh.... Hmmmm"".  Is it a perfect movie - no, its just a simple fun movie from the 60's.  It wasn't written to be an Academy Award winner but it certainly was fun to watch with plenty of shared laughs for the entire family... in this day and age when its more `acceptable' to be mean and snarky it was a great pleasure to watch a movie that simply was silly, laid back, and entertaining.  :]

Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1379635200,,4261,4.289637952559301

601908,5,6303212387,"Great classic full on comedy that will amaze you all, very different to a lot of oldies but worth every penny. Mr. Limpet loves fish and than accidently falls into the sea, so after a while he feels like he belongs there, falls in love with another fish romantic isn't it. While on land as a man that's just a failure in everything, his life, not happy with his marriage down in all aspects of life. So when he turns into a fish he is the happiest man alive, When the war begins he helps his country by making a loud sound in the water like a fog horn that blows up the enemy subs. Sounds odd, well it should because its comedy and nothing in this is normal okay. I rated this an A grade plus for the imagination of the writers and cast that put it on screen and made a great show, full on entertainment that puts comedy ahead of the rest. So what are you waiting for, go get the popcorn sit awhile, and relax put your feet up for a fabulous night of awesome unusual and different type of movie.  Enjoy!",1378080000,2,1003,4.11734693877551

602250,4,6303212387,"The Incredible Mr. Limpet(released Mar/64)stars Don Knotts(better known as Barney Fife on the Andy Griffith Show)as the star character,Lucille Ball proteg Carole Cook as Mrs. Limpet,Jack Weston as George Stickle,Elizabeth McCrae(better known as Lou Ann Pouvey on the Gomer Pyle Show)as the voice of lady fish,Oscar Bereji as the German Admiral and voice actor Paul Frees as Crusty the hermit crab. This was Warner Brothers foray into the animated market at the time which was,more or less,the sole domain of that big juggernaut Walt Disney. Warners,I think,pulled it off with this charmer. It wasn`t well received if I recall originally,but was re-released and subsequently went onto the small screen where it did very well.
The plot finds Don Knotts as a hen pecked husband,stuck in a mundane job that he doesn`t particularly like;all this during 1942/43. He absolutely loves fish and wishes he was one;in fact Don actually sings I wish I was a Fish,quite well I thought. The U.S.is getting hit by Nazi subs off the east coast and Knotts wishes there was something he could do.
A friend of Knotts,George Stickle who is a seaman in the Navy,visits Limpet and his wife one day and they decide to go to Coney Island. While there,Knotts is leaning under a rail staring intently into the water and falls in. During his descent he magically turns into a fish. His wife and friend consider him drowned,while in his new world he makes a couple of new friends relatively quickly;an old persnickety hermit crab called Crusty and another female fish called,simply,ladyfish. She immediately takes to him but because he is still ``married``,he has second thoughts. She swims off but much to his chagrin he cannot find her,as he has had a change of heart.
He tells Crusty to stay behind in the wrecked ship they first met in and keep an eye out for Ladyfish should she return. In the meantime Limpet has come to the idea he can be of great help to the US Navy,as he could spot and lead the American fleet directly to the Nazi subs prowling the waters. To aid in this,he has discovered a talent he originally did not know he had;a booming underwater `shout`.When a naval ship passes overhead he contacts them through their underwater listening device,then above water. They at first cannot wrap their heads around this body less voice in the water. He asks the Navy personnel to get his friend George Stickle,to be their liaison. They get George who rows out by himself and is stunned to see his old friend still alive,presumed drowned,but now in a fish body.
After this initial meeting the wheels of progress roll faster and faster. The Navy is able to take out sub after sub due to the help of Limpet and his underwater `boom`.However the German`s also become aware of the Navy`s secret weapon and they plan to stop him. They gather a large wolf pack of subs to take out an important US convoy and to surround and kill Limpet with homing torpedoes. Limpets booming voice fools the torpedoes and he leads the torpedoes back to the German subs,sinking them all.
In the end and after the war,Limpet becomes,of all things,a Commodore in the US Naval Reserves and he lives happily ever after with Ladyfish.
This film is a charming entry by Warners and Don Knotts voice was perfect in the lead role. He was well supported throughout and the animation is very well done.
Technically speaking this film is in either full screen or in its original a/r of 1:85:1 in this dreaded two sided disc. The film is quite clear and crisp. Extras include:An intro by Don Knotts himself,the press hullabaloo leading up to the films premier in 1964 in Florida,a look at the real sea creatures seen in the film,an interactive game and a trailer.
All in all this film is a charmer from start to finish. Knotts is top notch as Mr. Limpet and the animation is very good and still holds up quite well today. Recommended.",1340496000,,3881,4.734121122599705

Henry Limpet (Don Knotts) is a 4F bookkeeper in September of 1941. He has a huge fish tank and is really crazy about fish. In fact, he wishes so hard he could be one that he succeeds! Soon after he finds himself in the ocean, changed from a fall into the water off Coney Island, he hears that the Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbor. He also finds he has a huge thrum (a sound like a air horn) that frightens other fish away, even sharks. He decides to volunteer to work with the U.S. Navy to find U-Boats and direct the depth charges to blow them up.

602375,5,6303212387,"Growing up, I never missed a chance to catch this movie on TV. This early (1964) blend of live action & animation casts Knotts as the title character, a meek accountant with his head stuck firmly in the world of sea life during WW II. So much so that it creates strain with his loving but impatient wife (Carole Cook, terrific here) & annoyed Navy buddy (Jack Weston in a solid & funny supporting role). Naturally, on a trip to Coney Island, the song the picture chirps ""Be Careful What You Wish"" quite literally comes true when Limpet falls off the pier, and evolves (or is that DE-evolves?) into an actual fish, complete with Knotts' overbite & spectacles! Believed to be dead, his wife & friend move on with their lives. From here on, the movie is an undersea adventure as Limpet makes friends with a grumpy crab and begins an unusual relationship with Ladyfish. Along the way, Limpet discovers he has a powerful ""thrum"" weapon, and is soon enlisted by the military to use this weapon in locating Nazi subs. Inevitably, Limpet is reunited with his buddy under the craziest circumstances during his mission with the military. A rousing finale involving a blind Limpet (with Crusty the crab his ""eyes"") using the Nazis' own ""counter-weapon"" to sink their own subs makes Limpet the unlikeliest hero the military has ever seen.
While the animation is certainly not up to Disney standards, it's still extremely entertaining. And yes, while the script's notion of a fish aiding the military is utterly ridiculous, that's the film's endearing comic charm. You just want to see Limpet triumph!

602481,5,6303212387,"Don Knotts (1924-2006) had become a comic icon as Deputy Barney Fife on the Andy Griffith Show.  After winning five consecutive Emmys in the role, some may have questioned his decision to depart to pursue a movie career.  The success of his first feature film, The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964) proved that Knotts was not only a comic genius, but a genuine movie star with considerable box office juice.  Knotts would follow up with a string of hits for Universal Studios, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-and-Mr-Chicken/dp/B00009VU01/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost and Mr. Chicken</a>&nbsp;(1966), perhaps his funniest film.

The Incredible Mr. Limpet is notable, as it combines animation with real filmed footage, and features Knotts in a dual role as mild mannered accountant Henry Limpet, is transformed into a fish that then aids the US Navy in combating Nazi submarines, operating in the Atlantic during World War II.  Although a Warner Brothers production, the film is very reminiscent of a Disney movie, because of its high quality animation, goofy comic elements, and catchy musical numbers.

Henry Limpet is fond of fish, and has an aquarium in the New York City apartment that he shares with his wife Bessie (Carole Cook).  George Stickle (Jack Weston), a machinist mate in the navy arrives for a visit, and the three journey to Coney Island for a picnic.  When Henry falls into to ocean while on a pier, he is mysteriously transformed into a green bespectacled fish.

The transition from human to animated character is quite smooth, and the new aquatic version of Limpet quickly becomes adjusted to his new form.  He makes friends with Crusty (Paul Frees) the hermit crab, and discovers that he has the ability to produce a powerful sound, that can be used as a weapon or signal. He saves the life of the sexy `Ladyfish', voiced by the sultry southern drawl of Elizabeth MacRae, who is probably best known for playing Lou Ann, in Gomer Pyle USMC.  While Carole Cook's performance is fine, unlike MacRae she doesn't seem a very good pairing with Knotts.

The fusing of the live action and animated sequences is facilitated by an inspired idea, as Limpet patriotically decides that he wants to help in the war effort, when America enters World War II.  He communicates with a Navy destroyer and arranges a meeting with his old buddy George Stickle.  Jack Weston is predictably good in his role.  Working through the chain of command, Limpet and his `thrum', soon become the Navy's secret weapon against the Nazi U-boats, eventually becoming the instrument of defeat for the German wolf pack, in a major operation in the Atlantic.

The Incredible Mr. Limpet was great family entertainment when it was released, and even with the World War II theme and the slightly dated looking animation, it may still play pretty well with young ones today.  The animated segments are fun, and innovatively combined with real footage.  Knotts' comic persona remains intact, even as a fish.  The story is imaginative, captivating, and ridiculously funny, with the mood amplified by the various musical interludes.  Directed by Arthur Lubin (Mr. Ed), the cast is terrific, the acting wonderfully campy, and the voice work outstanding.

The image quality of the DVD is excellent, with ample sharpness, and vibrant colors.  The DVD also features a fun and informative vintage featurette about the film's unusual `underwater' premiere.  The Incredible Mr. Limpet, is undeniably one of the highlights in the career of the incredible Mr. Knotts.",1309564800,,3599,5.210069444444445

602483,4,6303212387,"Animation and live action combine in this family comedy, which stars the beloved Don Knotts as Henry Limpet, a meek and bespectacled but passioantely patriotic bookkeeper at a New York shipyard.  The Second World War is raging, Nazi submarine wolfpacks prowl the Atlantic, and poor Henry, who loves both his country and anything to do with the ocean, tries to volunteer for the Navy, only to be washed out for a regular laundry list of physical disqualifications.  That his wife Bessie's (Carole Cook) one-time suitor George Stickel (Jack Weston) has been accepted as a Machinist's Mate Second Class and is currently staying with the couple while on liberty doesn't make the situation any easier for him.  Henry begins to wish he could be a fish; fishes, at least, are never 4-F!  Then, on a day trip to Coney Island, he falls off a pier, and--whish!--he *is* a fish!  A talking, bespectacled fish with the ability to emit a literally stunning wave of sound he calls a ""thrum.""  When he observes an American ship trying to drop a depth-charge on a German sub, he makes contact with its captain (Andrew Duggan) and helps guide the charges accurately, then volunteers himself as a living Naval weapon.  It takes some doing, but with the help of Crusty (Paul Frees), a very well-named hermit crab, and the beautiful Ladyfish (Elizabeth MacRae), he succeeds in helping the US sweep the Atlantic.  But somebody's loose lips may yet sink Henry (if not his ship), for the Nazis have found out that he exists, if not exactly what or who he is.  This funny and charming little movie (a remake is supposedly on the drawing board) is suitable for all ages and has something to say about the importance of finding one's proper place in life.",1299801600,,1729,4.7558528428093645

Limpet is a kind of hero Walter Mitty, magically transformed into a fish and devoted to the US Navy in WWII.  The animation is strong, it is full of good characters who are funny in their awareness of the unbelievability of it all, and there are some surprisingly adult themes, like the fact that Limpet's wife may be having a love affair.

This time, I watched it with my son, who has a kind of indulgent tolerance of all the ""strange stuff"" I like to add to our DVD library.  Yes, he enjoyed it as much as I did, another thing to share across generations.  It is a wonderful film and Don Knotts adds his quirky talent to an original.

When The Incredible Mr. Limpet came on television some years ago, I do not recall what made me want to watch it, but I did, and enjoyed it very much. I could understand his obsession with his fish since I, too, had a tropical fish tank. I sympathized with his harried wife, played wonderfully by Carole Cook, who finally gave him the ultimatum to get rid of the fish or she would leave him. How appropriate then that he would solve the problem by wishing he were a fish, and having his wish come true. You have heard it said to be careful what you wish for, it may come true. Well, he was delighted that his wish came true. My favorite character was the hermit crab Henry named Crusty, but to see Andrew Duggan in this type of movie was really funny, and I recognized Larry Keating as Mr. Post's neighbor in Mr. Ed. A fanciful tale with the parting of Henry and his wife, the latter wondering if she was the widow of a man or the wife of a fish. At least Henry's dreams of serving in the Navy came true in a big way.

If you don't already know, Don Knotts' character turns into a fish after wishing he was one and then later on helps the US Navy find U boats.  The animation is pretty boring, but since it was made in the 60's, I should have expected it.  The acting seemed to be over done by everyone but Knotts.  Is the story line unbelievable?  Yes, but aren't all animated movies?  My husband and I had a few good laughs but the kids gave up on the movie long before it ended.

602932,5,6303212387,"THE INCREDIBLE MR. LIMPET (1964) is one of the most underrated films of all time. Coming in at approximately #64 on my own personal Top 100, MR. LIMPET is a blend of live action and colorful animation, an impossible fantasy film which somehow manages to entice even the most sourpussed of  viewers. Although it starts out a bit slowly, MR. LIMPET is irresistible, a pure entertainment experience.

The fishlike Don Knotts is perfectly cast as Henry Limpet, a nebbishy bookkeeper from Brooklyn, circa 1942. Walter Mitty-like, Henry dreams of being a war hero. His one other passion is his fish tank. When Henry is rejected from military service as a 4-F, he falls into a depression and escapes into unreality by wishing he was a fish.

Walking on the Coney Island pier one day with his wife, Bessie, Henry takes a misstep and falls into the briny Atlantic. Lo, and behold!---he is instantly transformed into a (cartoon) fish (complete with pince-nez glasses). Although Henry is initially lonely, he soon makes the acquaintance of Crusty the Crab and the seductive but loving Ladyfish, and sets off with them to explore his new, aquatic, world.

During one of his many misadventures, Henry discovers that he is the possessor of a powerful vocal ""thrum"" which can be used as an early warning system. Thinking quickly, he finds the ship his friend George Stickel is assigned to, and convinces Stickel (and the U.S. Navy) that he can act as a sort of secret escort for convoys and naval ships crossing the U-boat strewn Atlantic.

With Henry by their side, the Navy is able to turn the course of the Battle of the Atlantic, discovering and destroying enemy submarines and warships by the score. Although the Nazis try to stop Mr. Limpet, he is able to turn their weapons against them.

His wartime actions earn him high rank and many honors, and Henry Limpet, having become the fish he'd always dreamed of being becomes the hero he'd always dreamed of being, too.

A charming (and oddly gentle) war film, THE INCREDIBLE MR. LIMPET is a nearly forgotten gem, a true popcorn-and-soda family film classic that celebrates the hero in Everyman.",1168560000,47,2134,4.83013698630137

603041,5,6303212387,"After I watched this movie last night, I found out that Don Knotts had passed away.  Kind of a creepy feeling!  Anyway, Knotts who won five Emmys for his role as Barney Fife on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW was certainly one of our most endearing clowns.  With his trademark voice and bug-eyed delivery, Knotts is one of the true legends of our time, and in LIMPET, he shows us why.  Although he has more screen time as the voice of the fishy Limpet, Knotts manages to create a loveable character.  The plot's been rehashed in many other reviews, so I'll stick to what makes this animated/live action film such a pleasure.  With the cartoon stylings of the early sixties, the movie gives us a dreamy undersea world populated with such creatures as Crusty the Crab and the lovely Ladyfish.  On the human front, we're blessed with character actors Jack Weston, Larry Keating, and Andrew Duggan.  And the delightfully underrated Carole Cook, whose last scene with Henry the fish is unexpectedly poignant and touching.

A delightful film for the whole family to enjoy and to remember the delightful Don Knotts!",1140912000,51,1099,4.772486772486772

603045,4,6303212387,"""McHale's Navy"" meets ""SpongeBob"" with ""Action in the North Atlantic""? Well, that's one way to define ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"", one of the oddest family fantasy movies ever. An early attempt at a live-action/animation mix, it launched Don Knotts' post-""Andy Griffith"" career as the classic ""Don Knotts"" character: a geeky, milquetoast guy who stumbles into a heroic turn in spite of himself. Henry Limpet, of course, is two characters in one: a nerdy Brooklyn accountant who loves tropical fish, and- well- a nerdy, bespectacled cartoon fish!

With a WWII setting, he's an obvious 4-F as a human, but becomes an underwater guide for a Navy fleet as a fish. Oh, yeah- did I mention it's also (kinda sorta) a musical?

  Though released in 1964, ""Limpet"" sounds and feels like 1954- or is it 1944? It's as quaint as a movie can get: old New York costumes and settings, hokey humor, bumbling Navy brass and a super-patriotic musical choir. The animation, the late-model Warner Bros. kind, is a little bland by ""Looney Tunes"" standards, even with a few legendary artists (but no Jones or Friz) involved. And the non-Knotts cast is a little bit stiff on the whole, save old-timers Andrew Duggan and Larry Keating as the stuffy admirals.

  Yet, somehow, ""Limpet"" works better than described, especially if, like me, you're still fond of old-school family comedy Americana. The story's a cut above most period Disney fare, both animated and live. As a fish, Limpet's engaged in a kind of proto-""SpongeBob"" journey with his purple ""Lady Fish"" friend and a great little creation called- really!- ""Crusty Crab""! A kind of crustacean Yosemite Sam (voiced by great radio/

cartoon veteran Paul Frees), he actually looks and sounds a bit like Mr. Krabs- nearly 40 years before ""SpongeBob""!

  And how does our sea-creature hero, who still looks and sounds exactly like Knotts, interact with humans? Well, after his old Navy buddy George Stickel (the rotund veteran Jack Weston), who keeps getting called ""Pickel"" by the officers, almost drops dead after he discovers that his old friend Henry didn't drown at Coney Island after all, Henry-the-fish serves as an undersea swimming spy on German U-boats and, after a couple of underwater mishaps, helps the U.S. Navy invade Normandy, all to a booming, George M. Cohan-style patriotic chorus! Oh, yes- director Arthur Lubin was no stranger to talking creatures, since he helmed most of ""Mister Ed"" and ""Francis the Talking Mule"".

  They sure don't make 'em like this any more, and ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"", tacky and corny as it is, just might be a surreal comedy in disguise. Certainly it's one of the few pre-

""Roger Rabbit"" part-animated movies that works, awkward transitions and all (no computer tricks here, folks). It also started a new genre, the Don Knotts nerd-com, as perfected in deathless fare like ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" and ""The Reluctant Astronaut"". It's even a light-hearted salute to the kind of old-fashioned Hollywood patriotism that would get shot to Kingdom Come as the '60s moved on. Why, it probably stuck somewhere in Steve Hillenberg's mind when he grew up to draw the SpongeBob crew.

  The extras are modest (a ""fishtank"" game), but the little promo film, which shows the ""Limpet"" premiere at Weeki Wachee, an old-Florida tourist trap (it's near Clearwater) that involved mermaid shows and glass-bottom boats, is a priceless little slice of old-Hollywood ballyhoo, complete with a few words from Arthur Godfrey- who sincerely thought he'd have a hit with a rendition of ""I Wish I Were a Fish"", the ditty Knotts sings before he hits the drink. Beatlemania saved us from it.

  To enjoy ""Mr. Limpet"", it probably helps if you still love ""My Three Sons"", Lawrence Welk and other squeaky-clean '60s stuff. But when the Crusty Crab keeps calling Limpet ""Flatbush"" and the bumbling admirals give the fish an officers' commission, you're going to laugh. ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet""- it may be quaint, but it's really an ocean of fun!",1120003200,15,4001,5.004524886877828
603046,3,6303212387,"This is a very good movie. It's funny, and very original, a great take on wartime issues.

However, the only downside is that Don Knotts hardly appears in the film.  Of course we have him lending his voice to Mr. Limpet as the animated fish, but we hardly get to SEE him.

I think most people will agree with me that not actually SEEING Don Knotts really hurts this film.  Much like Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom, Don Knotts is an actor more known for his striking good looks than his actual acting ability.  I'll never forget his sensual performance in ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"", or his raw, animal magnatism in ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.""

So if you're a fan of Mr. Knotts' work, stick to films where you can see his best asset, his amazing body.",1100476800,7,746,4.369565217391305

Sure Don Knotts acting is fine but many of the other actresses are just too over the top.  The story line is terrible.  It's too serious to even just be able to laugh at it.

And I would not recommend it for kids either.  It is a PG movie.  Young children would not get it and be bored.  And older kids would pick up on the mixed marriage message.

Don Knotts plays a namby pamby, fish-loving, bookish bookkeeper in Brooklyn, married to a lively wife who doesn't relate to his habits. Unable to join the navy in anticipation of WWII, Knotts' character lands in the waters off Coney Island and turns into a fish, finally able to help the US war effort.
It's a cute blend of animation and film, carefully steered by a director who was involved in such efforts as ""Mr. Ed"" and the Francis (the mule!) movies. You'll recognize the blend of animation and film if you've been watching Disney movies with your kids (although this comes from the Warner Bros studios), and the media jump won't seem as silly as when Sponge Bob surfaces from Bikini Bottom.
The younger kids will like it, but it took a little cajoling to get some nine year olds to stick with it until the war scenes - - initially it was beneath them. But adventure developed, and the movie actually brings up themes regarding roles which they were familiar with from movies like The Little Mermaid (is Limpet a fish? a man? what's this mean for his old relationship with his wife, and new relationships with other sea creatures?) I hate to wax overly philosophical about this, but these are the parts which make it interesting for adults. As Limpet-the-fish says, ""There's nothing like realizing your importance to the world to make a man out of you. Even if that man is a fish.""
Yes, it has a bit of pathos, but it also has submarine battles, jokes, a crusty hermit crab, cute animation, and a great group of B-grade actors who are somehow able to keep a straight face through the whole exercise. (What may surprise you -- or disappoint you -- is that Knotts' character is never the frenetic, shrill Barney Fife. But he is very good nonetheless, and you shouldn't typecast him.)",1041379200,23,1789,4.628930817610063
603116,3,6303212387,"Although this film may be ""Stupid"" to today's teens - that it doesn't have the emotional resonance of 'Monsters, Inc' nor the Shakespearean scope of 'Lion King', it is still Don Knott's 'CITIZEN KANE'.
The '64 movie might seem a bit creaky by today's standards; so much celluloid has passed under the bridge since then, but there's still something downright charming about the milquetoast bookkeeper who turns into a fish after falling off a Coney Island pier, then winds up becoming the Navy's secret weapon in the fight against German U-boats (which, if the movie is to be believed, were cruising the waters just off Long Island in 1941).
It's all a matter of perspective to compare. The movie seems so dated, so carefully cute. Still, there is much to love (or at least fondly admire) in these brisk 102 minutes. On this DVD, the colors are as bright as a load of laundry just run through a cycle of All-Tempa-Cheer. Even the live-action sequences in Henry's apartment at the Coney Island wharf on board the Navy ships have the vibrancy of a well-inked cartoon. The Incredible Mr. Limpet at times resembles a tankful of exotic tropical fish. The seams between animation and live-action aren't always perfect; it's less clunky than the Gene Kelly/Jerry Mouse dance duet in 'Anchors Aweigh' nineteen years earlier, and a far cry from Roger Rabbit's mind-boggling effects twenty-four years later, but the combination is believable enough for any kid's imagination circa 1969.
If Limpet IS Knott's Kane, where does that leave films like The 'Apple Dumpling Gang' or 'The Shakiest Gun in the West'?
-Of course it's all a matter of taste and discretion, but I'd say those are his Magnificent Ambersons and Touch of Evil.",1035158400,11,1717,4.903780068728523
