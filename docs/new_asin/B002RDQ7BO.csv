8378671,5,B002RDQ7BO,"He has watched or listened to 4+ ""learn Spanish"" videos or CDs. This makes the most sense bc he heard the English 1st then it's spoken multiple times with the picture/action in Spanish.

He kind of likes the Language trees Spanish for Kids... But only because I already know Spanish and translate it for him (constantly).

Overall Learning with Paco & Frank is more enjoyable and engaging for a pre-K to K chil.

If he was already very exposed to hearing Spanish (maybe in a few months?) the Language Tree will be useful.

However, I give this a 5 stars bc my son likes the puppets, likes that it's in English 1st.

I like the topics and the large number of vocabulary words available. It'd be overwhelming for my son if he was ""studying"" for a test but since he watches if for fun he likes that it's kind of challenging.",1383782400,,821,4.410596026490066
