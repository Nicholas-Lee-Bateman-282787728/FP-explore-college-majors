8764797,5,B01H66WAUS,"THE STORY OF THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUMS (Zangiku Monogatari)
(1939, Japan, 137 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)
The first thing that needs to be emphasized about buying Mizoguchi Kenjis marvelous The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums is that this Artificial Eye version is not the one to get if you only want this film. Criterion released a new version earlier this year of a transfer taken from a beautiful print extracted from the Shochiku vault and that is now the best version on the market according to a number of people. You should only buy this inferior AE version if your DVD player cant play region 1 discs, or if you also want the other three films (saka Elegy, Sisters of the Gion [both 1936] and Utamaro and his Five Women [1946]) which make up their boxed Mizoguchi Collection. The AE prints are all dark, blurry and jittery, but they are at least watchable.

The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums is one of Mizoguchis most deeply revered films. Jonathan Rosenbaum calls it Mizoguchis greatest and Tony Rayns sees it as The peak of Mizoguchis art. The Life of Oharu (1952) and Sansh Day (1954) have very special places in my heart, but that is mere taste. Make no mistake, Chrysanthemums is as perfect as a film can be. As a melodrama its the daddy of them all (it makes the same years Gone With the Wind look like a storm in a teacup), as a film about the theater its unparalleled, as an analysis of patriarchal society its razor sharp, and as a subtle meditation on the human condition it is as deep as the ocean. What follows contains spoilers.

Key to the films success on all levels is the superbly balanced narrative structure in Yoda Yoshikata and Kawaguchi Matsutars adaptation of Muramatsu Shfs novel based on the real-life story of a Kabuki actor Onoue Kikunosuke (Hanayagi Shtar). Kiku starts the film the spoiled adopted son of a famous Kabuki star Onoue Kikugor the 5th (Kawarazaki Gonjur) who cant act and cant carry forward the reputation of the Onoue family Kabuki dynasty. He gradually learns his art due to the inspiring criticism of his brothers wet nurse Otoku (Mori Kakuko) who sacrifices herself so that he can achieve greatness. Across five acts set in three cities (Tky-saka-Nagoya-Tky-saka) Kiku embarks on a five-year odyssey both geographically and emotionally in which he grows up and realizes the true meaning of his lifes vocation, the effort it takes and the sacrifices that must be made. Cunningly structured for maximum effect, the narrative starts darkly with Kikus acting failure, lightens with the blossoming of forbidden love, darkens again to an almost complete standstill around the halfway mark before bursting into iridescent light only for Kikus crowning to be tinged with inevitable tragedy. In other words we have the natural ebb and flow of a lifetimes experience which feels entirely organic thanks to superb pacing achieved through Mizoguchis immaculate concern for detail and an obsession with mirroring key scenes, props, events and camera set-ups down to the tiniest item.

Although we cant be completely certain because so many of his films have perished, Chrysanthemums looks like a milestone in Mizoguchis career. At the time he was beset by a series of personal problems  his wife was sliding gradually into insanity (some say because of his constant tirades and marital infidelities), his political radical brother had been killed in mysterious circumstances and Japans military aggression in China was on the rise with the recent Marco-Polo Bridge Incident exciting much jingoism. According to Dudley Andrew all of this led to him dropping the propaganda work he was doing and retreating into a series of films set in the Meiji period about theater of which Chrysanthemums is the first and only surviving work. It is so successful that one wonders what the other three films (A Woman of saka [1940], The Life of an Actor [1941], Three Generations of Danjuro [1944]) must have been like, their loss surely constituting one of the great tragedies in cinema history. Chrysanthemums alone showcases the first flowering of his mature style which takes in a one scene, one shot technique in which long takes are the norm. Close-ups are completely eschewed and scenes are defined either by discreet camera movements in static interior sequences or by intricate (and hugely celebrated) outdoor tracking shots. In both cases the length of each shot is extremely long and actors are given all the time in the world to act with the barest minimum of artificial intrusion. This has been termed the monumental style by a number of critics and the balanced narrative structure of Chrysanthemums is achieved on the biggest scale by constructing giant scenes which relate to each other closely in two theatre styles  the style of Kabuki (there are three Kabuki sequences in the film coming at the beginning, on the 2/3 mark and near the end) and the style of shinpa theater for the main drama of the film. Significantly shinpa originated in Kabuki and is the bridge between that old art-form and the new gendaigeki of cinema. Mizoguchi had been making shinpa dramas since the 1920s and here he emphasizes it by casting two shinpa theatre actors (Hanayagi and his student Mori) who did very few films other than this and by keeping everything distant as it would be in a theater without recourse to fake (ie; non-theatrical) close-ups. Some people who have criticized the stilted wooden acting of this film have pretty much missed the point. The film is intensely theatrical from beginning to end and we can be sure that any stiffness reflects this shinpa tradition.

As noted the film is comprised of 5 acts, each one tied to one city except for Act 4 which is set in two. Within those 5 acts are three important Kabuki sequences with the long middle one forming the apex of the films Mt. Fuji-shaped narrative structure. The timings also say something so that the films structure looks like this:

Act 1: Tky (51 min.) - Opening Kabuki performance (Yotsuya Kaidan)
Act 2: saka (21 min.)
Act 3: Nagoya (38 min.) - Central Kabuki performance (Tsumori koi Yuki no Sekinoto)
Act 4: saka then Tky (9 min.)
Act 5: saka (18 min.) - Kabuki performance (a 'Lion Dance' celebrating the reunion of father and son) soon followed by closing Kabuki actor procession

Act 1 sets up the situation and gives equal weight to Kikus failing as a Kabuki actor and to the awakening love between him and Otoku, the only one who is honest to his face about his performances. The Onoue familys rejection of this love (a long scene where Kiku is confronted with his father, mother and brother and which ends in his expulsion from the family) underlines the duel meaning of the films Japanese title Zangiku Monogatari. Zangiku refers to the last blooming chrysanthemums. The name Kiku also means chrysanthemum. The four seasons of a year represent the cycle of life from birth (spring) to death (winter). Chrysanthemums bloom in autumn, but the last bloom as winter (death) is about to set in. The film is about Kiku, an actor who only blossoms late when he is in the face of death. The second meaning takes in what Kiku represents for his family, ie; the insurance that the Kabuki dynasty will not die out, that it will be continued after the death of his father. This means the film is on a second level a film about Kabuki, a theater form which thrives on family dynasties and feudal patriarchal social values. This broadens the tragedy that happens in the film from the personal to the universal. Otoku sacrifices herself for the man she loves, for the greatness of his acting, and for the survival of Kabuki itself as an art-form and the social values it represents.

A brief look at the films opening illustrates the above. Note the first two sequences of the film parallel the Kabuki stage with the Onoue family home. We start with a short shot looking up from outside the theater. We hear the Kabuki music and then are taken backstage as we hear a performance taking place. On stage we see a performance space split into two levels, the stage floor and an embankment which runs across the back. The audience (both in the theater and us) look up at the stage as we see Kiku acting. After backstage mutterings about his bad performance Mizoguchi takes us to a geisha house which we see at first shot again from below looking up through a latticed window. Kiku is not present, but the camera slides laterally left to reveal him standing outside and probably listening to the group inside bad-mouthing him behind his back. Disenchanted by the geisha thrust at him (who only want him for his family name and inherited money) Kiku returns home, Mizoguchi simply cutting to another shot looking up from below at the Onoue home and behind an embankment just like the embankment on the Kabuki stage. The feeling is that of a Kabuki play which is continuing on into the real life of shinpa drama. It is here that Kiku meets Otoku for the first time and in an exquisite long lateral track, the camera sliding to the right it seems forever (actually 5 minutes), we look up at these two people walking and talking innocently, but under the placid surface their feelings are swelling up for each other. It is 2 oclock in the morning (Otoku is outside minding Kikus brothers baby) and the night sounds combine with the feelings of these two as Kiku listens for the first time to someone who actually dares to tell him the truth about himself. We later see the exterior of the Onoue home from the same low camera angle two more times, after Otoku has been fired and then when the family rushes out after Kiku who has gone searching for her. Mizoguchis point is clearly to portray the beginning of a double tragedy here. First, the personal drama of the two lovers and second the drama of the threat to the Kabuki family. Mizoguchi at once personalizes and universalizes the significance of the events we see.

Act 2 moves to saka a year later and is split into two scenes, the first shows Kiku backstage still clumsy, tripping over things and acting badly in the employ of his aging consumptive uncle Tamiz (Onoue Tamitaro). The style is much the same as the beginning of Act 1, but then the second scene shows the mood lightening as Otoku is revealed in the shadows waiting for him outside the theatre. Her family had refused to let her go with Kiku a year before and after no doubt reading the papers about Kikus continuing acting problems she has decided to come and take care of him. In direct contrast with the tetchy backstage scenes, the tension evaporates completely as a second long and immensely sophisticated tracking shot follows the couple through the streets to Kikus poor lodgings. The highpoint comes when they turn a corner and walk directly toward the camera in a movement clearly meant by Mizoguchi to suggest the rapture of the two even if the conversation never rises above the mundane, the power palpably there in the restraint with which Mizoguchi observes his characters. The shot doesnt finish until they disappear into Kikus abode.

Apart from the extraordinary accomplishment of the tracking shot itself, there are important echoes here which resonate strongly both backwards and forwards in the film. First, the tracking shot obviously mirrors the earlier tracking shot described above which depicts the couples first meeting. As before, the burst of lyricism comes immediately after seeing Kiku humiliated at work and there is the repeated sense of Otoku appearing as his savior. Also as before, she walks with her hands to her chest this time holding a bag instead of a baby. Unlike the earlier track which was strictly lateral with the characters shown in profile from 90 degrees, here the track starts laterally but then backs away as the characters turn and walk directly towards the camera. This comes as a profound shock and announces very precisely the strong bond of love which exists between them. Clearly though Otoku will only stay with Kiku until his acting gets better, her heart will stay with him forever. Second, the tracking shot echoes forward to Act 4 when Otoku returns to saka after giving Kiku up. The camera position is the same as Otoku enters the house (a dark gloomy trudge which ironically comments on the ecstasy of the earlier walk) and in the scene in the house as she sits motionless for an eternity before lighting the stove and pouring herself tea, we notice it is a ritual which echoes (again ironically) exactly how Kiku does the same things for her earlier in Act 2. Act 4 is made up of two 5 minutes scenes which beautifully portray the reactions of both Otoku and Kiku to their separation. Kikus moments of melancholy are delicately achieved in a scene in his familys Tky home where he sees the same baby Otoku was caring for playing in the same place but having grown 5 years older and then in one of the most heart-rending scenes of all where he watches a man cut open a round loaf of bread. This echoes the scene in Act 1 when he cuts open a round water melon for Otoku. The camera is in exactly the same position for both shots, and Kikus melancholy is fully conveyed even though he is in the back of the shot and we can barely make out the expression on his face. It is Mizoguchis extraordinary control of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and formal structure which moves us throughout, not the acting performances per se, though of course there is nothing wrong in that department either!

The center of the films narrative is of course Act 3 which centers on two dialectically opposing situations. The first highlights Kiku and Otoku reaching rock bottom and near death while the second centers on Kikus triumphant Kabuki performance and his resurrection from virtual death back into the Onoue family fold. Act 2 finished with Tamiz dying and leaving Kiku with a travelling Kabuki troupe which takes him to Nagoya. An inter-title announces that 4 years have passed as we see Kiku and Otoku at the end of their tether, he beginning to give up on his Kabuki career and she vainly trying to inject life into him. They squabble and at one point he even hits her. Over a very long single take shot in the Nagoya theatre from a high camera angle we see Kiku rejecting the money Otaku eventually gives him and then observe the other company members fighting. Someone rushes in to announce the manager has done a runner and that the company has been kicked out by a group of women wrestlers who arrive just as the stage scenery comes crashing down. The camera gradually pans left to an open window through which we see the pouring rain. The whole scene is so simply done with great concern for ensemble acting with only the subtlest of camera movements as we see a whole world disintegrate. After a brief scene outside in the rain, Kiku and Otoku are forced into a doss house and seem doomed, a high camera angle again emphasizing their plight with other poor people who surround them. They have no privacy, no money, no prospects and above everything else Otokus cough announces the TB that will eventually kill her. The first half of the film has been structured to depict this gradual slide into destruction. It is interesting that when the characters have hope and a future, Mizoguchi chooses predominantly low camera angles looking up at them, isolating/elevating them out of the surrounding world. This emphasizes the connection with Kabuki that was made at the start of Act 1, the future of the art-form being constantly equated with the future of Kiku. When the characters (and the future of Kabuki they represent) are hopeless and facing wrack and ruin, the camera looks down mercilessly on them emphasizing the crowds that surround them and the quagmire of hopeless humanity into which they are disappearing.

Fortunately (and in the best tradition of shinpa theatre) a miracle is at hand. Kiku and Otoku notice a newspaper ad for an Onoue family Kabuki performance in Nagoya and unknown to Kiku, Otoku goes to see Kikus brother Fuku (Takada Kkichi) who offers to let Kiku play the main role in his place. If Kiku is successful he can come back to Tky, but under condition that Otoku must give him up. This 8-minute Kabuki performance sequence marks the epic epi-center of the film, coming as it does in the middle of Act 3 and acts as a pivot on which the whole narrative structure swings. The title of the Kabuki play we see is significant for the whole film. Tsumori koi yuki no sekinoto is very loosely translated as hidden love mounting like snow on the barrier. Tsumori koi yuki refers exactly to the stifled forbidden love mounting up like snow which Otoku harbors for Kiku, while the onnagata role of Sumizome which Kiku plays represents exactly Otoku herself. Mizoguchis treatment of this Kabuki scene where Sumizome fights a bad man out to ruin her secret lover (a metaphor for Otoku fighting off bad men from Kiku), and in which she eventually turns back into a tree (Sumizome is a tree spirit), is handled with extraordinary sensitivity. In contrast with the outer Kabuki extracts we see which are shorter and focus either backstage or on the actors performing, here Mizoguchi shows us the performers, but the focus is really on the reaction of the key observers which shows us that Kikus performance is highly successful. Several times Mizoguchi cuts away from the stage to show us Fuku, their uncle and most importantly of all Otoku who watches the stage hanging onto a wall barely able to stand up with the emotion. She is watching herself on stage and it finally gets too much for her as she climbs down under the proscenium where she prays in the dark to an Inari (a shrine present in every Kabuki theater for the welfare of the actors) that Kikus performance will return him (and Kabuki with it) to glory. This long prayer which Mizoguchi cuts away from and back to several times is the essence of what the film is all about - a woman sacrificing herself for her man. Just as Sumizome transforms back into a tree having given her all to save her love on stage so Otoku staggers out of the theater at the end and collapses beside (turning into?) a tree coughing from the sickness she has contracted through sacrificing herself to 5 long years of hardship on the road with a man with whom her love has always had to remain hidden and which like snow mounting up has become impossible to bear.

This idea of tsumori koi yuki is a hard one perhaps for Western audiences to grasp in the context of this film. We might think this is a simple love story where a couple run away from the mans family which forbids their love, that they have sex and live totally for each other in a romantic sense. This is not what happens in this film. It is clear that Otoku runs away to be with Kiku solely to inspire his acting. She is doing it for him and the Kabuki tradition he represents. At no point do the characters ever sleep together, they do not marry and there is no talk of children or of a shared future. As Kiku tells his disbelieving brother, Its not like that at all. She sees that Kikus greatest wish is to succeed in his craft and she sees that for Kabuki to survive the family he represents has to carry on through Kiku. As a poor daughter of a painter she cannot marry Kiku. If she did he and his family would be disgraced. This is where Mizoguchis analysis of class/patriarchy kicks in  as a woman of the wrong class her love for him can never be realized and any feelings they have (and of course they DO love each other romantically to be sure) must be hidden or suppressed in the face of patriarchal values enshrined in Kabuki, an art-form Mizoguchi clearly has immense sympathy for. Contrary to what Nol Burch has said, this is why I cant see this as a feminist film for Mizoguchi refrains from negative judgment of patriarchal values. If there is a villain in the film it is the Kabuki father patriarch but the director gives him a scene in Act 5 where he allows Kiku to visit Otokus bed with his blessing as she is dying. If anything Mizoguchi portrays the father here with a sympathy which flies in the face of any feminist attack. The director presents the relationship between Kiku and Otoku as a human tragedy of tsumori koi yuki (a love that through being repressed burns ever stronger and harder to take) to be sure, but it is also a fait accompli, as if to say that is how things have to be. At no point does he attack the way society is organized as he did in saka Elegy and Sisters of the Gion. Here he simply accepts the storys outcome as socially the right thing to happen. Kiku and the Kabuki family he represents are resurrected by the sacrifice of a woman whose greatest wish was that they both flourish. What happens is tremendously sad, tragic even, but ultimately is the right thing to have happened for great art to flourish. This idea receives even clearer expression in Mizoguchis 1946 Utamaro and his Five Women where the great ukiyo-e artist Utamaro (modeled on the director himself) achieves greatness through the sacrifice of all the women around him. For Mizoguchi, women suffering for men may not be right (and is often downright cruel), but that is how it has always been. Its less a social phenomenon than an eternal facet of the human condition which cannot be changed. This is borne out by the fact that whilst many of his films are jidaigeki set in the past, the picture he paints of society, of men and women is as relevant now as it was then.

The point that Otoku would be happier seeing Kiku and his family restored to greatness than to actually see Kiku suffering face-to-face next to her is made clearly in the encounter with his family on the train at the end of Act 3 as Kiku leaves Nagoya without her. Of course in human terms both Kiku and Otoku are unhappy at losing their love and the two scenes of Act 4 convey the melancholy suffered by both parties in no uncertain terms. These are two people suffering from tsumori koi yuki, but as Act 5 clearly states, what happens is for the good of all, including Otoku herself. The final Kabuki performance comments on a father who is proud to welcome his son back after a year of struggling wherein he has grown up. The sequence clearly stamps Kikus 5-year odyssey as a very necessary one for his artistic maturation. This is exactly what Otoku has provided and she dies because her lifes work is done and she has nothing left to live for. Her goal has been achieved and she dies happy. Kiku and the Kabuki he represents lives on better for the sacrifice she has made. This is the point of the final boat procession in which Kiku bows to his fans while Otoku listens and moves into the next world. In this final scene Mizoguchi captures a feeling of the deepest tragedy coupled with the deepest sense of life affirmation in a simple way which is as moving as anything I have ever encountered in the cinema. In fact the whole film deeply impresses by the way complex universal emotions and ideas are conveyed simply, elegantly, and with maximum poignant restraint. That is the genius of Mizoguchi.

This is a 5-star film which everyone needs to see. Alas, AEs bare-bones presentation is woeful. The print is dark, blurry, jittery and totally inadequate for such a wonderful film. As said if you want just this film then best go for Criterions 2016 new release which people say is much better. I have bought the AE box, but I will probably also buy the Criterion disc as well  The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums is unquestionably a masterpiece which deserves to be seen in the best possible condition regardless of the expense.",1480204800,19,23644,4.676838058625661

(Editorial Note:  Criterion folks, this exceptional film ""cries out"" for digital restoration.  Commercially releasing it [on HULU] in this condition is deplorable!)  Film = solid three (3);  cinematography = four (4) stars; interior set design = 4.5 stars; subtitles = three (3) stars; sound = 2.5 stars; restoration = zero (0).  Director  Kenji Mizoguchi has created a back-stage photo play about all-male Kabuki (dance combined with drama) troupes circa mid 1800s.  This is essentially a Kabuki-flavored  movie (see below) about performing Kabuki.  Popular Kabuki actors are depicted as the rock stars of their time complete with extravagant promotional parades, parasitic hanger-oners, and groupies. There are no surprises in the scenario.  All outcomes are telegraphed well in advance. You do not have to be a fan of Kabuki (an acquired taste?) to enjoy this film.  Kabuki performances are kept to a minimum except for the last third of the film which does suffer a bit from Kabuki overkill to underline a plot point (easy remedied  by the fast-forward button on your remote!).  Because of the absence of restoration, facial expressions of actresses and actors can not be determined (even in close-ups), hence depriving the viewer of seeing complete performances.  Actress Kakuko Mori plays a totally self-sacrificing character (from under-appreciated wet nurse to scapegoat actor's wife); she easily steals every scene she is in with understated bravado performances.  Not so much for leading actor Gonjur Kawarazaki who seems to have something other than acting on his mind (being called up for military service, perhaps?).  Mizoguchi uses open-wall interior sets which enable the camera to follow actresses and actors as they move from room to room and floor to floor in single long takes (no cuts).  (These are some of the best--if not the best--dolly [tracking] shots in Japanese sound films to date!)  (The Director's long takes foreshadow what Hitchcock used to prevent Selznick from re-editing his films.)  Perhaps most notable is Mizoguchi's remarkable death bed scene (at the film's end) which goes on for seven uninterrupted minutes or so.  This technique can be a double-edged sword, however.  The middle of the film sags precisely because of overly long takes of performers doing very little (or nothing).  Cinematography is also exceptionally creative for exterior scenes with long-tracking point-up shots predominating.  The score has a heavy flavor of Kabuki music; except for the opening credits, it consist of a solitary background singer, drums, shamisen, and other instruments commonly used in Kabuki performances.  Opening credits are accompanied by a small under-rehearsed orchestra with frequent audio distortions.  Microphone placement often picks up loud thumping of actors' feet on interior-set floors.  Subtitles are close enough, but none of the solitary background singer's lyrics are translated.  Highly recommended especially when digitally restored.
