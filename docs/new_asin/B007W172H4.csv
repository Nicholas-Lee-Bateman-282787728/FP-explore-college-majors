8522397,5,B007W172H4,"Though it is almost forgotten today, History is Made at Night is one of the most beautiful and romantic films ever to grace a movie screen. Released independently through United Artists in 1937, this gemstone has a fine screenplay from Gene Towne and Graham Baker, and some lovely words of dialog from Vincent Lawrence and David Hertz. A young and luminous Jean Arthur and the continental Charles Boyer utter those words in tremendously engaging fashion. Director Frank Borzage, perhaps the greatest romanticist the medium of film has ever produced, charts a lovely and charming course for the stars to navigate. It is essentially the story of two people trying to cram a lifetime of memories into one night, and then one moment, as tragedy looms directly ahead.

Irene (Arthur) is the wife of a cold and unhappy shipping magnate whose jealousy finally drives her to divorce him. Colin Clive portrays Irene's bitter and obsessed husband Bruce, hatching a plan in Paris to catch his estranged wife in a compromising position. But his plan goes tragically awry and their history will never be the same. Charles Boyer is Paul Dumond, headwaiter at Chateau Bleu, and Leo Carillo is his very funny chef pal, Cesare. Paul charades as a jewel thief to rescue Irene and whisks her away in the moonlight in one of the film's many romantic scenes. Unaware that he is only a waiter, Irene and Paul spend a charming and poignant night falling in love. Her husband's machinations have Paul sought in connection to a murder, however, and she sacrifices her new happiness to protect him.

Paul and Cesare charmingly scheme to open a restaurant in New York and hold a table for her, hoping fate will intervene on their behalf. Genuine love overcomes misunderstanding regarding his lowly position in life, but a dark cloud hangs over their happiness as an innocent man is set for a date with the gallows. Booking passage on her husband's newest ocean liner, the S.S. Irene, they sail towards France to make things right. As the two lovers head towards their destiny, the press on the lover's side, Bruce dangerously orders the captain to break the transatlantic record in a deep fog and a Titanic like disaster ensues. Borzage, always adept with material requiring a delicate touch and sensitivity, pulls off the varied elements of the romantic story as perhaps none of his peers could.

Jean Arthur is wonderful as a woman clinging to a happiness she has never known, and Boyer had one of his finest moments in American film portraying the affable and charming Paul. Borzage sets a very special mood for this touching story of a love that sails with no wind and a full moon. Not just a great romantic film, but one of the great films period, History is Made at Night is a forgotten film from a forgotten director, and both deserve to be remembered. This particular DVD offering is for region 2 and has Spanish subtitles. All those who love romance will certainly never forget this film once they see it for the first time.",1342915200,4,3006,4.788053949903661
