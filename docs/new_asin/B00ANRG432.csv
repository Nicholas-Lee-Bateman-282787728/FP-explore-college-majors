5460614,5,B00ANRG432,"I got this from the redbox today thinking this would help us passing some time at home on a Friday night. My kids are 9 and 11 and they can never stay still for a movie.  I am surprise by the movie that it actually pulls you in. It is a total sweet and warm movie.  My kids stayed in the living room to watch the movie with me and we all laughed and cried together.  I am not going to give away the movie. You should see it yourself and you will know what I am talking about.  The boy is so adorable and cute in the movie and I just can't help but rewinding the part that he sang in the car!  He is soooo lovely!
Go watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.",1366934400,34,663,3.81021897810219
5460615,5,B00ANRG432,"This wonderful movie should be in your family library next to Home Alone, Its a Wonderful Life, Touched by an Angel, Pocketful of Miracles, and The Christmas Box.
This is a touching movie with a great message that needs to be heard again and again:
1) The greatest love we can experience in the world is the love that a mother and father have for a child.
2) Each child should know of the deep love that their parents have for them.
3) We should look at everyone and realize that they are the beloved child of someone. With an accident, mishap or a bad break our children could be in their shoes and we should treat everyone with understanding and compassion.
4) Why some things happen in life is a mystery, but we can grow closer from our difficult experiences and learn to seek and spread the good ones.
5) There is a higher power that knows, cares about and watches over each of us - even in our deepest trials.
I found this movie quite by accident in a local RedBox after sorting through and avoiding hundreds of trashy movies with shoot-em-up, blood and gore, sex and nudity, bad language, and pathetic plots.  It is SOOOO refreshing to find this little gem with great acting, a beautiful story line, humor, and zero inappropriate material.  This quality movie has a timeless message that would land it among the classic family movies if more people knew about it.  We need more of these quality movies with good plots and family values.",1366588800,6,1442,4.517241379310345
5460616,5,B00ANRG432,"I [sort of] figured out what was going to happen toward the end, but was still left with the anticipation & excitement of how it would all pan out. It's a familiar scenario, but indeed original. I found myself wondering how would I be able to contain such joy had something like that happened to me, which I felt was the intention of the movie. And Eli (Morris Cole) was way too adorable.",1365897600,19,388,4.328767123287672
5460617,5,B00ANRG432,"Jonathan Newman's Angel in the House tells the story of Zooey and Alec, a couple who dreams of having a child, but is unable to conceive due to psychological trauma (rather than physiological issues). One day, after visiting a foster home, Eli appears at their front door and eventually changes their lives forever. The chemistry Newman created between Eli and his foster parents was wonderful, making their transition from a spiraling relationship to a loving family all the more special. This film had a feel-good magical vibe to it that is reminiscent of The Parent Trap and Elf (and more recently, The Odd Life of Timothy Green). Needless to say, Eli is one of the most adorable kid-characters of all time. With exceptional performances from Toni Collette, Ioan Gruffudd, Maurice Cole, and Richard E. Grant, Angel in the House is a must see for all ages.",1364342400,69,858,4.883561643835616
5460618,5,B00ANRG432,"Just looking at the poster for this film, and reading the synopsis, I expected it to be like another typically cheesy Hallmark style film.

Boy, was I wrong.

It was sweet, and honest. And I definitely fell in love with Maurice Cole, who plays the character of the little boy Eli. He's such an amazing actor for such a young child, so full of talent! He kept me watching the entire time. I am also very much a fan of Toni Collette and Ioan Gruffudd, and anything they are in I am more than willing to watch. I haven't really seen Toni in a soft mother role since About A Boy, but that is where she shines the most. And Ioan, he's just perfection.

Though I won't give then ending away, it definitely had me in tears. I would say that I'm a pretty tough person, and it takes a lot for me to cry. But this adorable film made a big baby out of me! I live for films that completely come out of left field and surprise me. It's a watch for the young and the old alike. Get ready for a warm fuzzy feeling.",1364342400,49,999,4.060913705583756

5460623,5,B00ANRG432,"I have just now viewed this movie for about the 4th time. I love it more now. This is a story of a husband and wife who have suffered a devastating loss who now seem unable to conceive. While waiting in a reproduction Physicians office the wife sees a pamphlet about an adoption home. They decide to go check it out and while there the mom sees an interesting child. They fill out forms, meet with the director then go home waiting to hear from them asap. Meanwhile the same child shoes up on the doorstep with paperwork from the home claiming he was sent by them after they were approved. He is dressed in a suit and is so grownup acting he totally charms the mom even as she is reluctant. She calls her husband home, shows him the child, who is asleep on the couch. They drive the child back to the adoption home only to see that the director has had a fall and is being loaded onto an ambulance. After speaking with a person not authorized to help them, but telling them she thinks all is well and she promises to call them back after speaking with the director when she gets back from the hospital, they take the child home and proceed to take care of the little man and all kinds of cuteness conspires in this home. Zany characters and challenges for the husband as his toy company gets hit by a recession continue to inspire as each very sweet scene progresses to reveal a secret as to the sadness that follows this family. A adorable segment where fun and love is reintroduced back into the hearts and minds of the husband and wife resulting in a future surprise that helps heal this family was one of my favorite parts of the movie. While one segment (as the issue is revealed) is sad, it is also very sweet and necessary as the viewer needs to understand why this family is the way they are. I loved both Toni and Ian in this movie. This is set in England and the home and nearby garden are so beautiful. So many scenes of just people being good to each other was so inspiring. For parents who have lost a child, this movie may be difficult but encouraging. There is one curse word but the Man quickly apologizes and really, how many of us have not done this? Also for the very religious, the fairy and (angels looking over us) aspect might turn them off. However I am a woman of faith who has strong beliefs but after I opened my mind and heart,(especially as my children and husband loved it) I loved it too. Just seeing this husband and wife begin to believe again that there can be happiness after loss and mourning and we do not have all of the answers, but we can maintain hope again and heal, and hold onto each other and let go of the past, really made this movie a winner for me. This is a family movie. The DVD, I think took out the curse words. I do not remember them or it from before. I viewed  this time through streaming. A very wise person once told me if children hear words we do not approve of, then we make a big deal out of it should they repeat it, most will keep saying those words. Mercy and moving on are better choices. Letting that keep one from a very sweet, loving and funny movie, to me , would be worse. Enjoy!!!!",1516579200,,3153,4.2288557213930345

5460633,4,B00ANRG432,"Originally released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foster-Region-4/dp/B008KCGHDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foster [Region 4</a>], the name of the movie was apparently changed and it became a Christmas movie.  It does end at Christmastime and it involves angels on Earth, so it can pass as a Christmas movie.  Maurice Cole is mostly a delight as a wise child who dresses like a businessman, and Toni Collette is an interesting, believable mother.  Richard E. Grant seems creepy at first as the homeless Mr. Potts, but he soon seems to project a prophet like quality.  And Hayley Mills is in the movie!  Unfortunately, not very much, but still it is swell to see her if you have fond memories of her as a child actress.  The storyline is actually serious, not comical or whimsical, so I'm not sure it should be considered a movie for children, but many viewers of all ages will like it.

P.S.  The sound quality was bad when I streamed it.  It went up and down, and I eventually had to turn on the closed-captions to catch everything being said.  (The captions are slower than the talk.) Toni Collette's accent at times was hard to understand, too.",1512950400,2,1194,5.171875

5460651,4,B00ANRG432,"Movie is a little slow by today's standards, but if you think of it as watching an old VHS tape or something, it seems just fine. This movie's main message is one of kindness in small actions.

You'll see throughout the film an attempt to communicate that sometimes life throws curve balls, but that those curve balls should not cause one to stop exploring. To remember the good in life. Ultimately the film is about being kind to yourself and others.

The Angel theme doesn't necessarily come through very strongly for most of the film, but is present at the right moments. I'd like to think that this is how things would really be done if you were being taught lessons by heavenly beings.

Best of all, this film is family friendly, with no cursing. The starring kid actually is somewhat Charming too. I did however feel the need to take off a star from my rating, because I felt the solution to the toy factory problem was not well ironed out.

In the solution, it seems like everyone just jumps on board for no apparent reason, all because they're not even sure what they're getting. In a real-world situation, board members would have found this gimmicky and would have wanted to vet the product first, especially as the real issue with the toys was never really addressed.

Presumably recapturing lost feelings allowed the father to move forward and make better products, but we don't actually ever see this. As such, I feel this was a weak bit of writing in an otherwise decent script.

It left me feeling unattached to some of the aspects of the show. But otherwise this movie left me with a good feeling, in a Touched by an Angel sort of way. I feel it is worth a watch.",1504396800,2,1679,4.506578947368421

5460827,4,B00ANRG432,"This movie (also known as Foster) was recommended to me on Netflix, and looked like another one of those adorable, yet cheesy Hallmark Holiday movies, which by the way is completely okay with me every now and then, but this one was an interesting deviation.

It's about a couple who dreams of having a child, but is unable to conceive due to psychological trauma (rather than physiological issues). As a result, they visit a foster home looking to adopt, and that is where they come across the adorable Eli. But no, they don't technically adopt him. He just lands up on their doorstep and kind of adopts them. You have to see this movie to know what I mean.

But I will say this - this film had a feel-good magical vibe to it that is perfect for the holiday season, and puts a whole new spin on the term Guardian Angels.

I would definitely recommend this one to everyone - young and old alike.",1484179200,,894,4.406060606060606

5461018,5,B00ANRG432,"SPOILER ALERT.....

If this child was an angel - - in other words, he didn't actually exist - - then how were Zooey and Alec able to register him in school?

If the homeless guy was also an angel, then why did he accept money from Zooey?
I would assume that he gave the money away to someone in need.

Are we supposed to believe that the Hayley Mills character was also an angel, or was she just ""in on it""?
If she was an angel, then how could she end up in a hospital?

The title gives away the ending - - but I didn't get it because I didn't take the word ""Angel"" literally - - I thought it just meant a sweet child - - so I was actually surprised at the end.

The ending shocked me and scared me - - when the phonecall came, saying basically that Eli never existed, I got a chill - - I expected that something evil was going to happen - - like the child was a demon and was about to become jealous and kill the new baby - - I have been watching a lot of horror movies, so my mind went in that direction.  When Eli was eavesdropping on the conversation where Zooey tells Alec that she is pregnant, Eli was expressionless - - if he was an angel, then he should have looked happy, even thrilled - - but Eli had no expression at all, which made me think that he was jealous or upset.  Also, Eli was a very strange child, which made me suspicious.  I thought  that it was strange that he didn't make friends at school or play with any children.  The movie does not say exactly how long Eli was living with the couple.

When Zooey read Eli's letter, I actually cried.  I rarely cry at movies.  But it touched me.

When the credits rolled, I wondered what they ever did with all of the Christmas presents that Eli never opened.
I wondered why Eli's last name was never mentioned - - he had to have a last name to be registered in school.
I wondered what they named the baby girl.
I wondered why Zooey told Eli everything about losing her son, but Zooey never asked Eli about his own parents - - he was living in a foster home, so it would be natural to ask him how long he was living there and what happened to his parents.
Zooey wanted a child so badly, but I found it strange that she didn't kiss Eli goodnight or hug him.

I enjoyed this movie, but I did not find it spiritual or uplifting - - I just didn't think in that direction while I was watching it.
I turned on this movie, having no idea what it was about, so I wasn't looking for something spiritual or uplifting.
While watching it, I just thought that it was a movie about a childless couple, later revealed as a mourning couple, with a need to love a child who needed love back.",1481068800,,2638,4.055876685934489

This is not sappy, or sentimental but it is sweet and it harkens back to to a time long gone in sentiment even though its set in contemporary times.

The acting by the actor playing the little boy is delightful and the three adult leads, Collette, Guettfrund and Grant, are spot on.

FYI: Whoever was responsible for locations and set design, did a great job. It didn't hurt to have some beautiful scenes with a to-die-for apartment and park (right outside!).

It's a light and upbeat movie. You, of course, have to suspend your logic because, after all, this is about ""angels.""

5461620,5,B00ANRG432,"I found Angel in the House (aka Foster aka Christmas Angel in the House) available to watch free with my Amazon Prime (I had NEVER heard of this movie before) but decided to watch it. This is such a sweet and uplifting movie! I wish there were more out there like this (instead of ones with graphic sex and violence). What a treat this movie is!
The movie stars Ioan Gruffudd (Forever), Toni Collette (Sixth Sense), and Maurice Cole who does such a fantastic job playing Eli (his first movie).  He is so sweet. Perfect casting. Hayley Mills also has a small part.
Amazon (Prime) Video did have Closed Captions.  I bought the DVD - it does NOT have any English subtitles or any other language, and no extras. The DVD case does say it has English captions but my newer TV doesn't receive closed captioned. I would highly recommend this movie.",1457222400,2,840,4.519736842105263
