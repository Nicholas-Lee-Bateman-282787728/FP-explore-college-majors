There were some stars like Wolfman Jack. Apollo's son was played by Kent McCord (One Adam 12 TV Show). and his partner was no Starbuck. Then again that would be cheezier and lame. They could have come out with just as cool character buy in different ways. Like no gambling, treating his body like a shrine and having quick catchy sayings. For example. Before they go into their Vipers and blow up Cylons, he could say"" Blow up the Cylons to Pylons"".
