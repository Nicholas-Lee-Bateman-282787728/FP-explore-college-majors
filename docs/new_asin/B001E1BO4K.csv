8295996,5,B001E1BO4K,I saw this on the TV at a spa & loved it.  A nice addition to the DVDs of logs burning in a fireplace.,1386633600,,102,3.25
8295997,1,B001E1BO4K,"This is just about the same as Christmas Traditions!!!  I mean the same pictures!  Between the two some pictures are used six times.  Also some of the items used are tacky as hell like the merry-go-round.  The faces on the children look like their lips were put on with a roller.  Although this mery-go-round was used on both, however the Traditions is better by far.",1318982400,4,367,4.584615384615384
8295998,1,B001E1BO4K,"Enjoy watching panning scenes of Wal-Mart decor?  If so, you'll love this Blu-Ray. Aside from the poor taste issue, there's also a good portion of overexposed footage and clipped colors. The only redeeming feature here is the soundtrack. It's actually pretty decent, and would suffice for a Christmas party if you turn the TV off so you don't have to see the tacky kitsch.",1228435200,3,372,4.8125
