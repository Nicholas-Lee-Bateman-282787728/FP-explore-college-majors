4903927,5,B005XQXFG2,"This magnificent video capturing the night of ""Sale El Sol "" tour in Paris, will definitely be the career savior for Shakira from the verge of falling down. From the album "" She Wolf "", shaki was going down in sales, even though the World Cup Theme song "" Waka Waka "" was huge sucess all over the world. But let's admit that "" Without USA, No Queen Of Pop "" just like Abba did almost 40 years ago. So gone are the days of Queen Shaki? Just in time, this super entertaining blu-ray released. Long Live The Queen Shaki.",1324944000,,517,4.18
4903928,5,B005XQXFG2,"The energy of the concert was amazing. Shakira seems to be really graceful and amazes me that she spoke French. I wonder how many languages she knows? Well she is amazing at her dancing and she is very sexy. I loved that the concert was very rock-theme plus you can hear some techno mix in it. I thought the BlueRay was very great at capturing the image and sound. A bit of odd slow motion editing but I got use to it since there isn't really that much. I only wish they showed more behind the scene in the Extra material but the main part. The concert, was beautiful and it looks and sounds great. Good performance.",1323993600,,616,4.273504273504273
4903929,5,B005XQXFG2,"Shakira continues to deliver excellent new performances of songs like ""She Wolf"", ""Loca"", and Gordita, in addition to earlier classics like ""Hips Don't Lie"", ""La Tortura"" and ""Osos Asi"".  Her enthusiasm, charisma, style and dance moves are her best work yet.  Caliente!

Shakira has a lot of danceable, high energy tracks here that are good to watch her perform live in person in front of a big audience.  Plus, the camera work and visuals are sharp and look great in blu-ray, and the audio comes through perfectly.  This one's a fun concert dvd, well worth getting.  Thanks Shakira for doing a great job on this concert for everyone; you're a talented, top performer.  A+

4903930,5,B005XQXFG2,"Absolutely tremendous to see her live, her show is much better than her music videos. I got to see her live on this 'Sale El Sol' tour, so I was happy to compare the experience of my live show to this Bluray. The setlist is largely the same, although Shakira sings a lovely French song near the end to the Paris audience.

The only complaint I have would be of the video editor: He cuts scenes every 2 seconds like an MTV video, it's very distracting. What is so hard with keeping the camera on Shakira? Yes, I do like to see the band and backup singers, but he repeatedly cuts every 2 seconds to multiple angles of her singing as well. Save it for rock videos. This becomes very irksome during ""Ojos Asi"". DO NOT interrupt Shakira's belly dancing! Keep the freakin' camera on her!

This is inexcusable when you consider that they recorded every show she did during this tour. Would it have been that hard to offer multiple angles, like other Blurays and DVD concerts do? I would have loved to have an option where the camera just stays on her the whole show.

Other than that clueless editor, a tremendous concert where Shakira dances for the entire show. Unbelievable energy. Probably the most beautiful thing she has ever done is her cover of Metallica's ""Nothing Else Matters"", with an acoustic accompaniment. There are also great performances of ""Why Wait"" (should have been a single), Las De La Intuicion, and the Gypsy flamenco dance.

Shakira's band is top notch, just as great as I remembered them. Multiple sets of musicians keep up with Shakira as she switches from rock goddess to Colombian small town girl to techno diva to harmonica player. She speaks French fluently throughout the show, surprising the audience. That makes at least four languages she speaks (Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French). She also plays acoustic guitar. And writhes like a snake. And a zillion other abilities that are better than Riverdance and Cirque Du Soleil put together.

Buy it!",1323302400,35,1981,4.730434782608696
4903931,5,B005XQXFG2,"Shakira proves once again why she has domintaed worldwide, She hold intellect, inspiration, she can sing, she writes her songs, and embodies what a real artist should like.

4903932,5,B005XQXFG2,I had the chance to see this concert live and this Blu-Ray definitely does it justice.  The DTS audio track is simply AMAZING and will really show of your home theater system.  You can hear every instrument perfectly separated and Shakira's voice just shines throughout the entire concert.  The video is crystal clear overall highly recommended for all the Shakira fans out there.  Awesome Concert!!!,1323129600,2,400,5.107692307692307

4903934,5,B005XQXFG2,"Once more I was fortunate to see this amazing concert live in San Diego, CA and Tijuana, Mexico. Shakira humbly reaches out to her fans throughout the entire night and is entirely devout to her audience. This performance shatters her stereotype as a ""hip shaker"". Although the stage set up was simple, Shakira was and continues to be the firework that makes the crowd roar. If you are a Shakira fan no need to convince you to buy because chances are you have 2 copies pre-ordered already, for everyone else this is a must have as a demonstration that true talent still exists. Not only did she deconstruct all her songs, she flawlessly re mastered them into a raw electric eargasm. Not to mention that she actually sings and dances from start to finish, there is no doubt that this petite woman packs the power of the sun not only in her voice but her soul as well. 5 stars does not do this justice!

I have purchased songs from both artist, and movies from Jennifer.

Shakrira is the best stage performer I have ever seen. She is loved by all the Latin countries, and has made a large dent in the USA. Her recording Empire is rated NBR 8 World wide. The Album  was only released on March 25th. Her husband, back in Barcelona is a professional Soccer player. Shakira has her son MILAN with him in Los Angeles.

4903982,4,B005XQXFG2,"Below I will first describe the aspects of this dvd/cd that are highly enjoyable and make it well worth purchasing.  Then I will move on to the reasons why it is not perfect and detail how I compensate for this to make my viewing experience more enjoyable.

The Good--

First, I have all of Shakira's dvd's and watch them quite frequently.  En Vivo Desde Paris lives up to the greatness that Shaki exhibited during the Fixation and Mongoose tours on the following tracks :

Pienso En Ti
Nothing Else Matters
Despedida
Gypsy
Underneath Your Clothes
Sale El Sol
Ojos Asi
Antes De Las Seis
Je L'Aime A Mourir
Waka Waka

On these tracks her vocals are powerful, emotional, moving, gripping, and in short everything a fan would expect to receive from a Shakira dvd.  Shakira is a full fledged theatrical performance; every note, facial expression, and movement are integral to the finished product.  This is clear on the above listed tracks, and, despite valient efforts made on other tracks by whoever filmed and edited this dvd, the above setlist simply could not be ruined.
If you are a long time Shakira fan, and thus familiar with the evolution of Ojos Asi, from MTV Unplugged, to Mongoose, to Fixation, then you will most likely delight in seeing Shaki continue to thrill her fans with the dance moves she brings to this rendition of a beloved track.  If you loved ""No"" in the red dress and wish it were in this setlist, Antes De Las Seis and Je L'Aime A Mourir are the ""No"" of this tour, only this time in blue.  If you loved MTV Unplugged, then the Nothing Else Matters, Despedida, and Gypsy segment will allow you to reminisce.  If you are looking for the new Hip's Don't Lie, it's Waka Waka.

The marvelous costumes and the exquisite lighting are nice touches in this performance/dvd.  The lighting is in my opinion the best of any of her tour dvd's, especially for Gypsy, Antes De Las Seis and Je L'Aime A Mourir, and Underneath Your Clothes.  In these tracks particularly, each type and color of lighting perfectly complements each song and constume.  As for the costumes, the rich pink and blue look stunning, and the way the costumes layer over one another is marvelous.  Per the usual, the costumes perfectly complement Shakira herself.

The Bad--

First, what I mainly do not like about this dvd has to do with the production aspects rather than with Shaki's performance.  There is slow motion editing which I really could have lived without.  A concert dvd, ideally, is a front row seat at the show, with a minimum of distractions.  Shakira's fans want to see shakira in the purest of forms, and by that I mean as she actually appeared in concert, not as she appears in slow motion.  Altering the reality of Shakira's movements distracts and detracts from the magic that is Shakira, and whoever made this dvd failed to realise that.

Second, the set list of old songs would have been better with some variety.  The Ladrones era songs that appear on this dvd are the same ones that Shaki always sings :  Si Te Vas, Inevitable, Ciega Sordomuda, and Ojos Asi.  Ojos Asi is to me Shakira's trademark song and MUST be included because it embodies the arabic sound that defines Shakira's music.  Furthermore, the Ojos Asi dance has been completely revamped and enhanced to become a new product for this dvd.  As for Si Te Vas, Inevitable, and Ciega Sordomuda, I would have prefered to have Shakira sing No Creo, Sombra de Ti, or Moscas en la Casa, which are only available on the MTV Unplugged dvd, or Tu, which hasn't been included in the concert tours since Mongoose.  The Laundry Service era songs suffered from the same lack of variety.  I love Te Dejo Madrid, but this tour dvd would have benefited from including the other spanish version only track, Que Me Quedes Tu, which isn't available on dvd rather than Te Dejo Madrid that is on the Fixation dvd.  Or if Shakira wanted a non-mellow song, then Te Aviso, Te Anuncio [spanish Objection] would have been much appreciated, and is also unavailable elsewhere.

Third, Gordita.  It is boring and wastes a slot that could have been given to either a better new song or a much more worthy old song.

How I self-edit to make the viewing experience enjoyable--

I start with Pienso en Ti, and then skip directly to Nothing Else Matters, thus bypassing the entire gold costume section of the tour.  This allows me to eliminate Te Dejo Madrid, Si Te Vas, Whenever Wherever, and Inevitable, all of which I prefer the versions avaible on the Fixation and/or Mongoose dvd's, and get straight to the good stuff which occurs throughout the later portions of the concert.  I also skip Gordita.  So overall my advice is include this dvd in your Shakira collection, and, if you have a dislike, decide for yourself which segments of the concert aren't your favorites and skip those.  Don't let the flaws in the set list or slow motion editing deprive you of the truly wonderful performances Shakira gave here in Paris.",1330041600,3,4964,4.668584579976985
4903983,2,B005XQXFG2,"Let me start off by saying that I really like Shakira, I have quite a few of her CDs and I have followed her since her major breakthrough album Piez Descalzos so if my review is not great it is not because I don't like her, but rather because I feel this concert does not showcase everything that she truly is.  It is evident that she has a lot of energy here and she gives it all for each song, but that exactly is my problem.  In almost every song she is jumping and running around, she literally does not stop moving the hips throughtout the concert.  This in itself is not a bad thing, except when it compromises the delivery of the songs.  Imagine running and jumping and trying to sing at the same time.  It is quite a feat, and my hat off to her for doing it, but in doing so, her vocals suffer quite bit.  My frustration with this concert is that she repeatedly does this for almost every song, she also does the freeze and unfreeze move way too much, till it becomes so repetitive that you just want to look away. I don't feel every song needs this much energy and effort, sometimes just her voice will do, sort of what like she did for the MTV Unplugged.  Yes, I know that was acustic, but the ideas remains the same, just her voice and the music. I would have liked to see more of blend of soft and hard, dancing and no dancing. This DVD is definetively not my favorite of her. Nevertheless, Shakira is a great artist and humanitarian.",1329782400,,1446,4.217391304347826
4903984,5,B005XQXFG2,This video is so much fun to watch.  I can't stop myself from getting up and dancing! Shakira is incredible!,1329523200,,108,4.4
4903985,2,B005XQXFG2,"I have always considerd Shakira one of the better bodies in the music world; however, she has lost some weight arround the hips.  This doesn't affect her singing voice; but, I had grown accustome to seeing those curves.  As for the conert she put on, it was nice.  The songs and back-up dancers where multi-curtural.  She started as an artist speaking Spanish and English; and she has gone back to her roots.  I'm not sure if a French word was given; but the music was good like always with Shakira.  She is a ture humanatorian and I like her.",1329177600,,543,4.434343434343434
4903986,5,B005XQXFG2,"We have a couple other Shakira's videos, one  of them is the Oral Fixation Tour Bluray. Just like the other bluray, this En Vivo Desde Paris presents a superb recording both video and audio, played very well in our Sharp 1080p 52 inch, as well as on our  Martin Logan Vantage (driven by Bryston amplifiers). I admire the director of photography or whatever the role is to present such good photography from all possile artistics and dynamic angles! The video captures the nuanse of the entire performance very well, the dynamic of the audience (huge stadium!) and definitely the dynamic of Shakira!

I and my wife are fans of Shakra ever since, love her songs and performances. We sit enjoying during this entire performance of some 90 minutes or more. With black pants, possiibly spandex, and golden top, Shakira looks still young, vigorous, slim and sexy.  Gypsy presents interesting dance drama presented by Shakira before the song was being sung, very intricate and passionate  dance. The dance gave a narrative to the song and made the song became more meaningful (at least to me). There was also a dancer before Nothing Else Matter was sung, very great performance. Nothing Else Matter is an unexpected interpretation by Shakira with the acoustics guitar team, a rock song by Metallica that I love  was sang so beautifully, very enjoyful along with Sahita passionate dance. La Tortura was sung without Alejandro, she seemed dancing similarly with the one in the other bluray. But I prefer the session in the other  bluray, in which she sang with Alejandro Sanz, with more complicated dances. They carefully selected the ending songs which are Hips don't lie and then waka waka. Waka waka was delivered with a very powerful message, effort for delivering Africa to a better future, I love the songs, full of high spirit and melodious. I also saw Waka Waka performance in the video of World Cup in South Africa. Confetti was speread at the end of the performance, a very artful  photography as the video ending.  The Extra part, just like other Shakra's videos give many glimpse of Shakira's live and performance behind the stage, nothing unusual, but still very good to see how Shakira looks in 2010 and 2011... btw the Paris show was in June 2011.",1328918400,2,2253,4.846354166666667
4903987,3,B005XQXFG2,"The blu-ray arrived this week.
The concert is spectacular! Shakira's performance is breathtaking!
There are some extras, nothing too long.
The audio sounds good! It comes with DTS-HD Master, LPCM Stereo and Dolby.
The only thing not that good was the video quality: not that realistic, the moving images have a kind of blur. The concert doesn't play on 24p playback, and that makes some difference.
The Oral Fixation Tour blu-ray seems to be superior when it comes to image.
But don't be discouraged to buy it, the show is great! It only didn't get a 5 stars rating because of the missing 24p playback and the not all that good image.",1328832000,,634,4.669642857142857
4903988,5,B005XQXFG2,"This is an outstanding concert! Shakira's performance is tantamount to greatness!! Her stage presence is magnetic and she is seemingly in perpetual motion. What a show!!!

4903990,4,B005XQXFG2,"I was so excited to be ordering this in the mail. It is an excellent and very exciting DVD for any Shakira fan.
It gets your heart beating faster, makes you want to dance, and for her slower songs it will even move you.
The sound quality is subperb. The picture is clear. The special effects add just the right spices to this musical DVD.
The Extra's are great and funny to watch, very interesting. However, I was hoping they would of added their bloopers in there,
which they didnt. But all together, this DVD is One Of A Kind!
Let the Shakira fiesta begin!",1327104000,,558,4.3238095238095235

4903992,5,B005XQXFG2,"We saw this concert (Live) in the Chicago area. It was fantastic and ordering the DVD allows me to watch it anytime. A number of the performances were far enough away not to see specific detail, but the DVD has allowed me to see what we have missed.",1325462400,,249,4.208333333333333
4903993,4,B005XQXFG2,"The picture and audio is great. Shakira's performance is great too. But the blu ray maker is foolish, they don't put subtitles when Shakira is singing. How can you expect me know English, France, Spanish? Even English I can't hear clearly when she is singing. This is happening on all living Blu ray/DVD.",1325289600,,304,4.754716981132075

4903995,5,B005XQXFG2,"I bought this because a)Shakira is hot and b) I like her music. I have her other two concert videos, and so far, this one is my favorite. Its more high energy and eclectic and showcases a lot of the variety of music she's capable of singing. Her concert videos are all elaborate and have lots of great sets and outfits and lighting and sound. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a Shakira concert on blu-ray over the other two concerts she has out. Especially the one concert video with ""Hips don't lie."" That one pretty much blows. The sound quality on it is not very good. This blu-ray has great sound, however.",1325030400,4,620,4.4
