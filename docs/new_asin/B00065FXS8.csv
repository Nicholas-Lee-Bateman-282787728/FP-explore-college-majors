2168956,5,B00065FXS8,this workout is great for beginners ..you'll actually break a sweat but your not killing yourself doing the routines..after a week or two i could actually feel and see that my legs were much more toned and i saw a difference in endurance aswell...,1228953600,,247,4.636363636363637
2168957,5,B00065FXS8,"I love the strip to fit dvd in this series. Its easy to follow, you might not feel like your doing to much while your working out but later that day you will be sore.  I loved not killing myself and still feeling results. Carmen is not overly perky or annoying and I liked the male instructor as well.  The chapters section of this dvd is great because you can just pick how long of a work out you want depending on how much time you have.",1218240000,,439,4.0344827586206895
2168958,5,B00065FXS8,"This is a short but great workout.  It's easy to follow and fun.  I recommend it to any woman wanting to lose some pounds and/or tone her body. I lost weight fast combining this workout and a healthy diet.
The DVD menu is varied. I love this aerobic DVD!",1208044800,,254,4.163265306122449
2168959,4,B00065FXS8,"It's a good short workout, and will bring you to a sweat.  They do more resistance and isolation than anything else.  You wont' use weights during this tape, but you HAVE to have a chair to do ALL of the workouts.  Not exactly a routine for a person living in a one bedroom apartment without a kitchen table (aka no chair).",1207699200,3,323,4.262295081967213
2168960,5,B00065FXS8,This was more of a workout than I expected.  It concentrates on many areas of the body and you feel a burn by the end of the video.  Carmen and her trainer are very entertaining and motivating.,1205280000,2,193,4.1891891891891895
2168961,5,B00065FXS8,"I loved the way they mixed exercise with striptease, she does a great job...",1107043200,2,76,4.5

8038918,5,B00065FXS8,The best workout I've had in a long time my thighs and butt is so sore and I love this whole video it is very motivational and you want to do it again and again you will be sweating your butt but you will be making your butt bigger I highly recommend this DVD I love it this is a wonderful workout Carmen Electra is a joy to watch and she is a great instructor very motivating,1475798400,,376,3.896103896103896
8038919,5,B00065FXS8,"Great workout. You can customize your workout with a separate Arm, ab, and leg section or you can do the 30 min warm-up/workout. The warm up is a great workout in itself. Made me sore and I am use to Tracy Anderson Dance workouts.",1467072000,,230,4.25
8038920,5,B00065FXS8,"Love this workout, better for semi begginers though.",1464998400,,52,5.625
8038921,5,B00065FXS8,"I love this dvd, it offers a complete variety of workouts all in one routine you can do in the mornings or when you prefer to workout. I have noticed results such as having more energy in just a few days, which is how it goes when you workout. This dvd only has the exercises not the dance routines so if you are looking for that as well I would suggest the complete set. This dvd however does have the tools you need to get your form and posture dance ready. My favorite is the ability workouts they are not harsh at all but you can feel that it tones as you do them. I also love that when you follow the workouts you can change the music to make it more enjoyable to yourself.",1464912000,3,678,4.029629629629629
8038922,5,B00065FXS8,This is one of my favorite workout DVDs that I have ever come across.  I had it before but it got scratched so I bought it again. It is enjoyable to do and it breaks the workout down into 5 sections so if you didn't have time to do them all you could do one or 2 parts at a time. It also showed that everyone isn't a pro at working out even someone with an amazing body like hers can goof up.,1356652800,2,392,3.7228915662650603
8038923,5,B00065FXS8,I bought this based on other reviewers and they were right.  Its a great workout and you definitely feel better and see results after just a few times doing this DVD.,1329177600,,166,4.354838709677419
8038924,4,B00065FXS8,"I have done the warm ups on this dvd a lot for a few reasons
1. focus is on not hurting yourself
2. Its strength building and light cardio
3. The work outs are fun
4. They keep it simple
 I really enjoyed doing the exercises and stretches on this dvd and my friends have too. After exercising at my house to this I had a friend that bought the dvd for home. I payed around $4 for this dvd previously owned and it is my most used work out!",1306972800,2,438,3.8666666666666667
8038925,5,B00065FXS8,"I love, Love, LOVE, this workout video. I've tried many and I usualy come back to this one. If you faithfully keep up with it, you will see results. I like Carmen, she's not too showy or anything. After a while of using it, I usually just mute the TV and put my own music on, because it starts to get repetitive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to start working out!",1282608000,5,388,4.1866666666666665
8038926,5,B00065FXS8,"This product is great. Really works! After two weeks i honestly felt a difference. Keep it up, be faithful and have a healthy diet and you'll see results in no time!",1269302400,,165,4.354838709677419
