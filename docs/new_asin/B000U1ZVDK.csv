8211817,3,B000U1ZVDK,"This is a campy sequel to a campy film. The opening recaps the first film. Good Vampire Sugar ( Jill Michelle) and her human boyfriend Dex (Daniel Lennox) wind up in Little Rock Arkansas. They have with them Marvin, the bloody ugly puppet from the first film and Marvin's now dead son Ivan (Ricardo Gil) a midget Van Helsing. The want to locate the new head of the vampire clan so they can use his blood to revive Ivan. The trail leads them to  Sweet Hearts, a strip joint.

The film was funny the first time. The second time through it loses its charm. Charles Band has done worse. Three stars for the nudity.

8211818,5,B000U1ZVDK,This movie was good very entertaining for a movie that wasn't that much to make. Jessica Morris is a great actress and Jill Michelle wished she made more movies as well. However I don't like the fact that amazon Only has Dacadent evil part 1 for rent only.,1439337600,,256,4.354166666666667
8211819,1,B000U1ZVDK,"Sugar and Dex have survived Morella's wrath, but now it is up to them to stop another foul vampire lord from collecting the last remaining souls he needs in order to grant himself immortality, using a sleazy strip club as his front for luring in new victims. Like the previous film, DECADENT EVIL 2 is utter garbage, and barely passable even as a cheesy B-movie. Some may say that the insufferable characters, unimaginative plot, and artless direction should all be expected from a Full Moon film of the time, but Charles Band generally brings some fun form of exploitation to even the worst of his features. The sex doesn't sell here, and neither does the horror.

8211820,4,B000U1ZVDK,"I watched this movie without having seen the first ""Decadent Evil"", and they show you a 2 or 3 minute recap at the beginning of the movie, and that was enough for me to understand the story leading up to that point. The Movie is about a sweet vampire named Candy and her boyfriend Dex, who are traveling with Marvin the Homoculus and Marvin's dead son(died in the first movie)to Arkansas, to track down the head vampire and to get his blood so they can revive Marvin's dead son. They end up tracking him to a small town's Strip Club, where they take jobs( Dex as a Janitor and Candy as a Dancer)to infiltrate the vampire clan to find out who's the head vampire. The movie is not bad, not much happens though. And it ends up turning into more of a Mystery movie than any Horror movie. But, none the less it still entertains. This movie is not for everyone. If you enjoy B movies or have seen other Full Moon movies you should enjoy this one. If you're seeing this only cause the plot is centered around a Strip club you shouldn't be too dissapointed in that aspect. But, if you like ""Horror"" in your Horror movies you should probably keep looking. The only real horror in the movie are the vampires.",1190160000,9,1198,4.352678571428571
