7974923,4,B00007AJDK,"This is a single sided DVD containing the following 3 movies: 1) 'Only With Married Men'; 70 minutes, color; Dom DeLuise, Michele Lee, Gavin MacLeod; A spirited young woman has a sure-fire plan to protect her heart and avoid commitment, she will only date married men. What happens, however, when she finds true love in a single man...with a big secret? 2) 'There Goes The Bride'; 91 minutes, color; Tom Smothers, Twiggy, Martin Balsam, Sylvia Syms; A bumbling ad executive is obsessed with a fantasy woman who is invisible to everyone but him. He sees her image everywhere, including at his daughter's wedding. Is he crazy or just in love? 3) 'The Girl Who Came Gift Wrapped'; 74 minutes, color; Karen Valentine, Richard Long, Tom Bosley, Farrah Fawcett; He's a swinging, Hefner-like magazine publisher. She's a small town beauty with big city dreams. When she shows up at his bachelor pad as a 'birthday present', it's meant to be a gag gift from his buddies. Some jokes, however, can have an interesting twist. I have taken the descriptions from the DVD case to post so there is a description available for your shopping. These are light and fluffy comedies from the not to distant past (well...at least from my perspective). These appear to be made for TV movies which featured several popular TV stars of the time. These should be particularly enjoyable for those of us who remember TV from the Seventies and can recognize several of the stars.--Bob",1102291200,44,1454,4.843373493975903
