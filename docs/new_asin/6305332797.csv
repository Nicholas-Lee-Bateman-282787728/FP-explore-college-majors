7887681,4,6305332797,Good sound quality and visuals. Unfortunately there are no subtitle in English. The ad never said there were subtitles. I just hoped there would be.,1404864000,,148,4.96
7887682,4,6305332797,"I have rarely been in a situation where I can confirm or deny what others may say of a performance because I was there. And this was a major revelation in my life. I had never been to a live opera performance other than university stuff, and the Teatro de la Zarzuela was the perfect, small-sized European style theater to be able to see and hear everything. Much better than the RTVE broadcast, which is what this video is from. The video itself is pretty bad, and the sound is not the greatest, by any means. That being said, Ms. Caball gives a lesson in how to carry an opera production on your own. Not that the rest of the cast is unsupportive or the conductor and orchestra are lousy, it is just that Caball's artistry is far above the other components of the production. Her Norma has always been my favorite interpretation, even above, dare I say it, Callas's several contributions. Callas plays Norma as an angry, vengeful woman, it seems to me. Caball introduces the needed ingredient of pathos to make Norma believable as a human. This was made clear to me in the second act of this production. And the finale of the third act injects the proper sense of surrender to fate and ultimate serenity that I crave. Pedro Lavirgen is not a name well known outside of Spain really, and while he was revered in Spain for both zarzuela and opera, the latter especially in Barcelona at the Liceu, the former at the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid. I have never been a real fan of Lavirgen's voice, sounding to me too much like a Franco Corelli wannabe. Given that, he plays the part of Pollione fairly well, and basically gets out of Caball's way. The same cannot be said for Ms. Cossotto, who whoops it up as if she were the prima donna; however, most of the time her upper register goes flat. The ""Mira, o Norma"" duet ends up being a bit of a screech fest as a result. Cossotto's husband, Ivo Vinco, grumbles through Oroveso as if he had received a bad check for the performance. Still, the reason for this tape existing is Caball. And she uses every vocal trick in her repertory to extract a truly memorable performance. A definite must have for Caball fans.",1400716800,,2161,4.459595959595959
7887683,3,6305332797,"Caballe sings a great Casta Diva here, but after that she has trouble with her highest notes.  Either they are harsh and shrill or she simply doesn't sing them at all and sings a lower note instead.  Except for her Casta Diva, she sings better in the 1974 video.  Another thing is that Josephine Veasey in the 1974 video is a far better Adalgisa than the constantly smiling, applause-milking, edgy-voiced Cossotto in the 1978 video.  Ivo Vinco has the bass voice of a God, but his part is too small to redeem his wife's constantly smiling (showing all her teeth, even while singing) Adalgisa.  The 1974 NORMA recording has it's problems too, mostly the wind, but it is definitely preferably to this 1978 recording.  And besides, the 1974 recording has subtitles, which the 1978 recording does not.",1213747200,2,797,4.781021897810219
7887684,5,6305332797,"The performance is legendary and widely hailed as one of Caballe's best ever.  However - rather than praise the tape I want to point potential buyers to the BelCanto Society website!  While supplies last, the tape sells there for $16.95 rather than the sky-high nonsense asked by Amazon sellers.  Happy viewing!",1166745600,,311,5.0588235294117645
7887685,5,6305332797,"When the video opened I was a little scared.  The stage seemed small, cramped, and the sets and costumes have a brown with toast accents theme (it's a performance from 1978, after all).  But then the singing starts.  The Orovoso has a deep, authoratative voice and a commanding presence.  The tenor basically yells all of his lines, but he yells them with conviction, and I'm convinced he's yelling because he was angry at the bad wig and mutton-chop sideburns he wears throughout.  Cossotto sings well as Adalgesia, but seems more interested in milking the audience for applause than in presenting a character.  Caballe was having a great night, singing a lovely ""Casta Diva"" although she barks out a few of her high notes in the first two acts.  Based on this video it's hard to understand why she earned criticism for not being a convincing actress, and as good as she was in the first two acts she is absolutely on fire in the third.  This is a great performance.",1045526400,8,967,4.647058823529412
7887686,5,6305332797,"Just incredible. Caball is the most amazing soprano since Callas sing Norma. She declaim peace in ""Casta Diva"" and declare war in ""Guerra Guerra!"" with the same capacity, beauty and power.
She is pure quality, a real actress and singer. If I have to choose between Joan Sutherland, Maria Callas or Montserrat Caball I'm prefer the magnificent Caball",1014681600,5,349,5.0344827586206895
