And when I finally find it, I discover it is a copy of a bad VHS version, with a picture and sound

quality that it's a shame to put on the market on a DVD.I allready have an VHS copy at home, that is fare

more better than this DVD.I can off course bear the loss of the money, but with the sincere hope, that this

movie some time in the future could be released in a propher quality version on DVD, and

this time for real! From a propher master and with subtitle.

This film is worth it!!!",1168646400,12,574,3.9051724137931036
455386,2,6302312418,"This so-called remastered DVD version of ""The Next Man"" is not a technical improvement on the original VHS version. In addition to highly distorted sound and fuzzy picture quality, the film was poorly edited. The tech info provided by Amazon is skimpy and misleading at best, and deceptive at worst. This a better-than-average movie warrants a higher quality transfer and Amazon customers deserve more reliable and detailed product information.

Shame on Amazon!",1168214400,21,462,5.416666666666667
455387,2,6302312418,"Since this is the only version of this rather fine movie available, it is a pity that the buyer and viewer have to sit through a version whose DVD video transfer is so poor it looks like a VHS dupe of a slow speed VHS dupe shot through somebody's screen door.  The audio quality, lo-fi for its day, would be acceptable if not for the incredible THD distortion especially noticeable on background music: even at low volume.

Furthermore, the 108 minutes running time claimed is not what you get:  you get 90 minutes, period.  Somebody decided to excise quite a lot of this movie.  This was probably taken from a VHS tape edited by a TV studio for  content and running time.  In short, this DVD never saw, got next to, in any way associated with, nor ever had the chance to contemplate what its filmic potential might have been with a decent transfer.  I could make a better slow speed VHS dupe from a VHS dupe than this piece of visual drek.  The image quality is so poor I had some difficulty reading the opening credits due not to small font size, but rather to fuzziness.

There is no mention of running time on the box, not surprising, and no inside the box literature.  Shame on Amazon for marketing this piece of cinematic disingenuousness and not giving more detials and accurate information.

You've got to watch what you are buying these days.

I like the movie, it is a very decent film and one not seen on the market for a long time.  Too bad this is what we have to settle for.  Someone should take the video distributor to task for their work.

455428,4,6302312418,"I saw part of this movie being filmed outside my office building in NYC and even got Sean Connery's autograph before they finished filming this.  The movie was not a big hit in the theaters but I loved it because of him and because of watching it being filmed.  Years later when I thought of the day he cocked his eyebrow up when I asked for his autograph, I got online and ordered the DVD.  I'm just so happy to have this DVD as part of my collection.",1363996800,,452,4.113636363636363

let me start by saying that i'm a big Sean Connery fan, and that is probably the main reason i went looking for a copy of this movie, and finally decided to buy this one.
the movie itself seemed interesting enough and had potential of being an enjoyable experience for me had it not been for the poor DVD quality. I mean the quality is very poor, its like a VHS copy and a poor one at that, i've had my shares of watching DVD copied from VHS and it still looked better than this drivel. picture quality was beyond bad, just awful and atrocious. i also had a big problem with the editing, and i was blaming the producers for it before i read some reviews that mention that the editing must have been made by the DVD copiers or the TV or VHS it was copied from. very terrible editing that distracts the viewer.
the running time was cut short to around 90 minutes, meaning a lot of scenes were cut, and probably the running time for this DVD was even shorter since some of the scenes were copied and pasted all over again, meaning they repeated certain scenes and attached it over other ones probably for censoring reasons while keeping the original audio.
the audio was slightly better than picture quality, but still very poor with today's standards.
now i really can't comment on the movie fairly given the heavy editing, censoring and poor quality, it did hold my interest to some extent, at times seemed dragging. acting by Connery was good as usual.
the soundtrack was also poor in my opinion, very basic and as if it were made by a kid, some lame Italian or Greek like romantic music which was quite distracting.
an insult to any DVD collector or movie fan. zero stars for the DVD, however, 2 stars added just to be fair to the movie.

in summary, a barely watchable copy of a long lost film, still very poor with today's standards and unforgivable transfer really, the movie does have potential and seems to have an entertaining quality to it hidden underneath an atrocious DVD quality transfer.
so $24.99 ? really ? this should be offered for free given the quality of the DVD. its 2013, this transfer is not acceptable at all.",1357257600,2,2193,4.441687344913151

The quality looked so bad I didn't have the patience to even view the video DVD. This in NO WAY represents the movie itself.

Recently I opened a Blockbuster and Netflix account just so that I could watch EVERY available movie that he made. I have NOT been disappointed. I enjoyed this movie, Sean was his usual charming self, his screen presence is so powerful. I would suggest this movie to any SC fan.

455435,2,6302312418,"One thing you must credit Sean Connery with for the years between superstardom and omnipotence was his willingness to undertake projects that were more interesting than infallible. This film earns its low rating on a realistic scale beacuse it does fail to live up to its potential. The drab edges of a small-scale production budget spent on a small-scale film from small-fry film-makers show in every frame. Yet the concept is one that better thriller-makers should have adopted, and at the centre of things is Connery, a Sheik for the second time is his film career, and obviously from the same family line as the Raisuli, for his sheikness here is also blessed with a Scottish accent. Connery has long-ago given his justification for the refusal to disguise the accent with a tirade on the universality of film, piqued towards the swamping of the world with characters of all makes and nations all delivered with an American voice. Yet here, the major speech the Sheik makes at an Arab summit in full Scottish roar demands your affection for the actor for credibility to remain. Beyond this, the film becomes a neat enough little thriller, admittedly of television dimensions, which remains tight till the twist at the very end. Connery is cool and commanding as he should be. Leading lady Cornelia Sharpe was well-known to be the leading lady of a studio executive, the only means she had of earning her few screen roles, but she is decorative enough, surely as competent as other models who believed looks can act. This isn't a great film, it's a fair enough diversion, but Connery completists, it is a must, and not entirely sn embarrassment.",1235433600,2,1648,4.868327402135232
455436,5,6302312418,"Don't be put off by the ideology-heads who label this movie propaganda and racist. Racist? Come on, people! Sean Connery as the hero plays an ARAB!! And, beside, labeling anti-Arab sentiment as ""racist"" is simply lame and brain-dead. Arabs are not a race.  Duh.

The movie has it's fair share of slow points, less-than-steller acting, and plot stumbles, but all in all is quite a good movie, and (if viewed with anything but an ideologically-shuttered mind) raises several thoughtful issues.

All in all, the movie deserves at least a 3/5, possibly a 4/5. I'm giving it a 5/5 to partially counter the obviously fanaticism-driven negatives that try to trash this more-than-adequate, thinking man's spy thriller.",1231027200,,710,5.156521739130435
