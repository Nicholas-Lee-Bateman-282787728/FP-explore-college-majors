7788845,4,0767819276,"A surprizing tale of a hero cop getting duped by a striking dame, and finding himself entangled way too deeply.  I want to play it again soon for the ending. Good acting and a complex, believable storyline.",1206576000,,206,4.5675675675675675
7788846,4,0767819276,"Perry delivers a good and solid performance as a PI who has bad luck and drinks hard. along the way he investigates for a divorce proceeding that leads to a dangerous affair with the wife of a rich client. powerful in the sense. the highlight is at the end where Perry comes to Adam Baldwin's house, with a stick and just rams it into his gut and starts whaling on him with it, it was awesome. Gloria Reuben of E.R. fame also stars. a great view",1067040000,,445,4.186046511627907
