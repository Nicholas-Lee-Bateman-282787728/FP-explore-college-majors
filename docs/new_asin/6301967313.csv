391309,4,6301967313,"My 5-year old grandson and I really enjoyed this movie. It is a 1960 fantasy that appeals to any adventure-seeking boy.  I would say it definitely is more suited to ages 5 and up. The story is about a young boy who finds a bottle with a genie in it on the beach, and the boy is granted his wish to be a pirate. But he discovers that the pirate life is not glamorous but dangerous and hard work, and he soon wishes to return to his home and family. A good lesson that the grass is not always greener on the other side. I did not watch the 1988 second feature, ""Crystalstone,"" since I bought the DVD just for the first movie. We had seen part of The Boy and the Pirates on TV but couldn't watch the end, so I promised my grandson I'd buy the DVD so we could see the whole movie. Overall, I would rate ""The Boy and the Pirates"" by what my grandson said... ""It was cool!""",1262822400,,867,4.011560693641618

SYNOPSIS:
12 year old Jimmy finds a bottled genie as he walks along the Massachusetts shore and is granted his fondest desire: to be a pirate! But the reality of buccaneer life is mostly drudgery and sweat and nothing like Jimmy's fantasies. All he wants now is to go back home to his parents.

7818410,5,6301967313,I saw The Boy and the Pirates in the theater when I was 12. I thought of it now and then over the years. It was nice to find it on DVD and fun to watch again. Crystalstone is a movie from Europe and a bit different in style. It seems a nice film for a family with young children. Both make a fine DVD set for family/child entertainment.,1484092800,,336,3.8840579710144927

7818416,5,6301967313,"These two movies have great adventure for both young and old.  They are wonderful family adventure stories to share together.  ""Crystalstone"" may be the best childrens' adventure movie of its kind. Your heart goes out to the orphaned brother and sister in their desperate but miraculously successful quest.  ""The Boy and the Pirates"" is delightful and well done magical tale.  Both movies share the theme of seeking treasure, but the real treasure lies in the heart, in finding home, family, and love.",1338595200,3,501,5.073170731707317

The girl, Katrina, who is played by Susan Gordon, has her own website...check it out.  As I purchased this item for ""The Boy and the Pirates"", the movie ""Crystalstone"" was an added ""pirate"" bonus.  If you or your kids like ""pirate"" movies, these are both good movies and easy on the pocketbook.
