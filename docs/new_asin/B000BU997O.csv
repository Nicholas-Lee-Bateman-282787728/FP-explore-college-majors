2442363,3,B000BU997O,"This is yet another production dragged down by a dubious staging.  Honeck conducts with consistent energy that is not too agressive, yet never sags into a fatal legato which would stall the foward motion of the music. His instrumental balances further the goal of keeping the music moving.  These are not easy balances to obtain and many famous conductors including Gardiner and Boehm fell into a boring legato conducting Cosi, in my opinion.

Martinez and Koch as Fiordiligi and Dorabella have the power to sustain, yet lack personality.  I don't feel that the men do any better in developing characters.  Helen Donath overdoes the part of Despina.

The ""no place in a no time"" staging may be to blame for this, but I get the sense that the singers are each doing their own thing.  There is no sense of ensemble, which may be the single biggest common problem with some M22 productions.

La Finta Semplice has great ensemble despite an empty stage and white featureless costumes.  I suspect that the very generous spirit that Malin Hartelius always brings to the stage was very contagious in that production.  She and Josef Wagner were allowed to invent their own sign language for instance.  Schloemer, the director, encouraged his singers to improvise on a stage that was devoid of any predetermined concept.  A very dangerous approach that worked.",1185235200,6,1351,4.929203539823009
2442364,2,B000BU997O,"I must admit that I'm mostly writing this review just to say:  why doesn't someone tell Sophie Koch that it's not necessary to open one's mouth past the point of dislocation to sing well?  It was all I could focus on when she sang.

Other than that, the singing on this DVD is actually quite fine.  The stage direction, costumes, and sets were, on the other hand, pretty horrible.  None of the costumes flattered the performers (who are all in good shape), some of the stage direction made them look ridiculous (and forced them to screw up all their courage to try to motivate some of the ridiculous actions they were called to execute), and the set was completely uninteresting and uninspired.

And I have NO IDEA why they would ask a 67 year-old Helen Dorath to sing Despina!  She was almost as laughable as the ancient Agnes Baltsa performing the same role...but she sang much better.  (Baltsa sounded alright in her upper range, but seemed to have to shout everything in her chest voice and passaggio.)

To sum up:  I would avoid this production, as there are MANY other versions available on DVD with both fine singing and great sets/costumes/staging.",1181433600,5,1156,4.706467661691542
2442365,2,B000BU997O,"This is one of several recently released DVD's from the 2006 Salzburg Festival at which all of Mozart's operas were performed. They've been dubbed the Salzburg M22's.

Unfortunately, this production is disappointing. I don't mind that the directors (Ursel and Karl-Ernst Hermann) set ""Cosi"" in the modern day. (When Guglielmo and Ferrando were disguised as hippies in the 2002 Berlin Opera production of ""Cosi,"" it worked just fine.) I don't mind the ambiguity of the locale (ranging from retro 1950's dresses to Japanese-style sets to even a game of badminton). But the production, with a few exceptions, is muddled and lifeless. The directors' intentions are confusing and, perhaps as a result, the production lacks depth and has little spark.

It may be that it takes both the comic and the emotional punch out of ""Cosi"" for the directors to play it as if the sisters know from the start that a trick is being played on them. Whatever the reason, the production feels superficial and often mechanical in execution. The singing is competent (indeed, it is excellent in places), but the performers don't create distinct characters. I know this opera very well, but unless they're identified by the piece they're singing, I have to struggle to tell which sister is Fiordiligi, which one Dorabella; which suitor is Guglielmo, which one Ferrando. It's as if these otherwise competent performers are confused about their characters' intentions and motivations.

Even the orchestra is lackluster. Never has the heavenly ""Soave sia il vento"" trio sounded so lethargic and, well, unheavenly. I think it's the first time I've ever heard that trio and not been moved by it.

There are a few highlights (Ana Maria Martinez does an admirable job negotiating Fiordiligi's difficult ""Come scoglio""), but on the whole, this is a muddled, uninspired effort. The production features the same Guglielmo and Ferrando (Stephane Degout and Shawn Mathey) as in the Aix-en-Province DVD from 2005. I highly recommend that production over this one.",1179619200,7,2025,5.164634146341464
2442366,4,B000BU997O,"This is not your usual opera buffa production of Cosi Fan Tutte. The director explains his vision of the production in the DVD notes: ""Why shouldn't Cosi be something other than bubbly and light-hearted? And why shouldn't one take seriously everything that Mozart and Da Ponte wrote? For Cosi deals with complex issues, speaking to us of the all-pervasiveness of desire, showing us that one can have love for more than one person at a time and that there is infinite sorrow in discovering this, and some little sweetness in accepting it, and furthermore that Alfonso knew all this, and that he had a natural vocation to torture those unhappy souls who did not know it..."" I've seen other productions that focus on the dark side of this opera (e.g. the Zurich Opera production from 2000 with Cecilia Bartoli), but this is the first one that works for me because, although the production is serious in tone, it's not cynical. The final scene will touch your heart, as the disillusioned and bewildered players wander aimlessly around the stage during the final chorus, only to take refuge in each others' arms.

The highlight of the production is Elina Garanca as Dorabella. She possesses a rich mezzo voice of great flexibility and deep beauty. In a word, it's luscious. Because Dorabella is a true mezzo here (so often not the case in casting Cosi), her duets with Fiordiligi make for the most sublime harmonies. Their mezzo and soprano voices contrast and blend beautifully. Even the recitative between them is more musical than ""dry."" As Fiordiligi, Erin Wall has a expressive and smooth soprano voice, but she suffers in comparison to Garanca both in singing and in acting. I found myself wishing that Mozart had composed two arias for Dorabella that were as challenging and stunning as those he gave to Fiordiligi (but such is still the reward in the opera world for being a soprano). Whether it was due to the strength of Elina Garanca's performance or whether it was part of the director's vision, this Dorabella is not Fiordiligi's usual silly sister. In this production, Dorabella is the more sophisticated and assured of the two sisters; she's just also more driven by desire, so she ""falls"" first. It's a different take on the sisters' relationship, but it works.

I greatly enjoyed Ruggero Raimondi as Don Alfonso. Like many who find themselves cast in this role, he's past his prime as a lead (he was once a fine Don Giovanni) but, unlike many others in this role, Raimondi's voice is still robust and expressive. The other performers are very good; they just can't compete with Garanca's Dorabella. (You can hear her voice above the others in the ensemble pieces, not because it's too loud, but because it's of such high quality.)

Unfortunately, there are times when the pace is off in the ensemble pieces. (Perhaps it's because the production takes place outdoors and the performers can't always hear the orchestra well enough.) The result is that some of the ensemble pieces (so vital to this opera) sound a bit ragged and don't build in intensity the way they should.

All in all, this DVD is definitely worth owning, although my favorite Cosi remains the 1992 Theatre du Chatelet production conducted by John Eliot Gardiner. That production succeeds in finding the right balance between the serious and the comic side of Cosi, while never forgetting that the focus should be on its heavenly music.",1174348800,25,3414,4.870912220309811
2442367,3,B000BU997O,"It's increasingly amusing to see various commentators at this site vying to identify the Mozart production from M22 at Salzburg which best deserves the title of the stupidest and ugliest. My nominee for the prize is Ursel Herrmann's and Karl-Ernst Herrmann's ""Cosi Fan Tutte."" (I don't say Mozart's and Da Ponte's, as the Herrmanns have in this instance made the work singularly their own, and should therefore receive full credit for what they have wrought.)
In an interview accompanying the performance, while Mr. Herrmann largely sits meekly by, Ms. Herrmann enlightens us as to the rationale behind this ill-conceived eyesore of a production. She is a wholehearted supporter of the conventional idea that classics are not of a time, but instead ""universal."" What this means to her, unfortunately however, is that as stage director she need not bother to set ""Cosi"" in any specific locale or period at all. She further acknowledges that she'd never before been especially drawn to this masterpiece because it has women too easily deceived. What this encourages her to do is seriously defy the libretto and have the aforesaid women aware of the men's wager which gets the action started. What an original, necessary insight for our time! Da Ponte and Mozart constructed things differently, but what did they know?
To sum up, because we have characters still singing in Italian and reflecting 18th century social class but dressed at the same time in much uglier, more modern costumes and treading around among the absurdly minimalist scenery that has become a Eurotrash cliche, this production, far from being universal, is simply and mindlessly not taking place anywhere. Its visually unbecoming oddness calls more attention to itself than any other feature.  Further, and equally far from ""universal,"" this production to the extent it approaches ideas, fosters Ms. Herrmann's bumper-sticker-deep, sadly  dated ""feminism"" along with her unearned cynicism about human ""feelings.""  The most suitable locale for such a procession of stale images and ideas that complacently thinks itself ""cutting edge"" would be, I submit, the wall of Plato's cave, with the audience the bound prisoners and the Herrmanns the manipulators of the pantomimes projected on it. ""Universal,"" in short, to the Herrmanns means apparently their directorial freedom to engage in the unwitting promotion of contemporary cliches in sets, costumes, and vision.

The Herrmanns agree further that fussy stage business is necessary at every moment. If clashing swords interfere with chords in the overture, for example, it makes no difference. Who after all still goes to the opera to hear the music?  The audience was probably assumed by the Herrmanns to be made up instead of hyperactive types or people forced in the workplace to ""multitask."" If its members had to hear only miraculous music, glorious singing, and satiric wit, they might get bored.
Not only must the audience be bombarded, then, with excessive stage ""business,"" but even some of the orchestra members have to be irrationally brought into the action, for fear that they too, by just playing their instruments, might begin to feel hopelessly non-interactive.

The saving graces of this production are in the areas where the Herrmanns would have had the most trouble interfering. The music is beautifully played and finely conducted. Despite the seeming effort to dress and make up the characters in as unattractive a manner as possible, everyone is in good to fine voice. These last features alone are what have garnered the stars in this review.",1171670400,23,3583,5.222608695652174
2442368,5,B000BU997O,"The most wonderous performace in all M22, 2006 Salzburg Festival Mozart Complete Operas. The singers are also amazing, especially Stephane Degout (Guglielmo) and Ana Maria Martinez (Fiordiligi). Mr. Degout is very handsome (probably the most beautiful face and physical appearance I have never seen before in Opera DVDs!) and his singing, acting skill are perfect. The staging is a little bit monotone and simple, but, you must forget this along enjoying the performance. The ensemble is marvelously beautiful and magnificently done by all singers. This is top notch performance. Wonderful !",1169856000,5,591,5.5054945054945055
2442369,5,B000BU997O,"The singers are all good, the orchestra light, lively and evocative.  But it is above all Patrice Chereau's direction that makes this production one of the best filmed opera experiences I have had.  This is a fairly long opera (about 3 hours), but it flies by in this version with rapid and telling movement on stage and in the pit, and with a constantly moving camera.  Chereau's is an expectedly dark interpretation, both modern and classical, that refuses to play up the buffo elements and achieves a remarkably heart-rending, bittersweet effect.  The singers are all well-coached actors; we are never allowed to forget that we are watching a performance (occasional views of the conductor in the pit) but that doesn't mar the emotional impact of one of Mozart's most touching scores.  Period costumes on what is made to seem to be a bare, ancient Italian stage.",1162166400,22,865,4.897260273972603
2442370,4,B000BU997O,"All of the participants in this endeavor are excellent on their own terms, but the total effect, while a treasure trove of parts, remains an indifferent whole.  The chief problem is the lack of balance between singer and orchestral volume.  Muti, despite his profound respect for this miraculous score, carries on as if he's the early James Levine conducting Wagner at the Met, seemingly intent on drowning out the singers whenever the opportunity presents itself, and thereby pushing the orchestra into excessively high relief.  Too many soft, reflective, and strikingly beautiful parts of the vocal line accordingly disappear from due prominence, and this despite presentation in a small theater ideal for Mozart. I am of course assuming the problems manifested themselves in performance and are not just a matter of engineering fault in the transfer to DVD. But in any event they do interfere with the excellence of the performance on disc.",1159920000,12,943,5.190789473684211
2442371,5,B000BU997O,"Not everything here deserves five stars (more on that later), but the amazing vocal offerings here keep me from rating it any lower. The best elements are Erin Wall and Elina Garanca who sound absolutely marvelous together; also, their respective arias are definite highlights. Erin Wall's soprano is silvery and shimmering--powerful at the top and surprisingly audible below the staff; the middle voice is smooth yet textured. Also, every syllable is colored with emotion. As did most of the cast, she got better dramatically and vocally as the night proceeded, but ""Come scoglio"" is by no means a disappointment, though her ""Per piet"" is better. I wish I could make it down to the Lyric Opera of Chicago this season to see her Fiordiligi there. Elina Garanca is never any less than fabulous as Dorabella. The voice is large and opulent but high-reaching and agile; she is dramatically captivating at every moment and never drains the tension. Barbara Bonney sounds kind of odd to me below her thrilling high register, but she continuously acts as saucy as Despina should, borrowing (never stealing) the show when necessary. Of all the cast, she ornamented the most, but Mozart is supposed to be ornamented. She made it work. Tenor Shawn Mathey wasn't intensely engaging as Ferrando, but he was no less enjoyable, making ""Un aura amorosa"" a high point. Stphane Degout inhabited Guglielmo and managed to make ""Donne mie, la fate a tanti"" more exciting than boring, though I suspect conductor Daniel Harding had a literal hand in this--he kept Mozart's score vibrant and dynamic as it should be (however, the cast occasionally fought him for tempi, though it can be tough to coordinate orchestra and singers in an outdoor theater; also, some delicious cadences are glossed over). Some people seemed to like him, but I couldn't stand Raimondi's Alfonso here. His physical mannerisms--hands flailing at the sides, wide eyes, spread mouth--grated and too much flatness pitchwise proved obnoxious, though, fortunately, he managed not to mar the transcendent ""Soave sia il vento."" Plus, most of his music isn't that beautifully written, so no huge loss if his voice isn't as fresh as it used to be--he plays an old character, after all. As for the direction, some of it really worked and allowed for opera to be sexy (and not crude, either), while some of it was hopelessly abstract and / or anachronistic if not saliently so. Also, I get the impression that not all his demands were not the most vocally compatible, yet the cast, as a whole, coped and sounded beautifully. The relatively young age of the four lovers probably helped in this department. One more item:  The recorded sound seems pretty true to the voices and orchestra, but the instruments are more closely miked (due to the theatre layout) and occasionally overwhelm the singers. All in all, I highly recommend this DVD for its musical and textual accomplishments.",1156464000,23,2925,4.993852459016393
2442372,5,B000BU997O,"I borrowed the heading from one of the movements of Bartk's Concerto for Orchestra; it translates roughly as 'The Play of Pairs.' And that certainly is the thrust of this wonderful production of 'Cos fan tutte' from the 1983 Salzburg Festival, directed by Michael Hampe with sets and costumes by Mauro Pagano. The mise en scne makes much subtle play of the mirroring of the various pairs in the opera -- Fiordiligi and Dorabella, Ferrando and Guglielmo, Despina and Don Alfonso. Costumes, settings, stage action all tend to come in pairs, with just enough differentiation to make it more subtle than blatant. It certainly adds to the delicious comedy of the opera.

Some months ago I raved about a La Scala DVD of 'Cos' conducted by Riccardo Muti but this one, also led by Muti, is even better, at least partly because the singers are better by a slight margin, the stage action is more delicately funny, and Muti is, if anything, more in tune with his cast and the musicians. I find little in this production to complain about. First, there is a simply marvelous cast. I occasionally found Margaret Marshall's tight Supervia-like vibrato a little bothersome, yet her big aria ('Come scoglio') is superb and she is likewise excellent in her Act II scena 'Per piet, ben mio, perdona' (and the horn player in that rondo also deserves a bouquet). Meanwhile, her blend with Ann Murray's Dorabella in their numerous duets is extraordinary. Murray's 'Smanie implacabili' is delicious. She plays Dorabella as more minxlike than some, adding to the comedy. The two men, Ferrando  (Francisco Araiza) and Guglielmo (the young James Morris) could hardly be bettered. They are good actors -- farcical, of course, but that's part of the fun -- and vocally in top estate. Morris's duet with Murray in Act II ('Il core di dono') is breathtaking and his aria 'Donne mie, la fate a tanti' is likewise. Araiza triumphs with a meltingly beautiful 'Un'aura amorosa'; he is in particularly fine voice and he's a better actor than I remembered. His voice also has enough metal for 'Tradito, schernito.'

Sesto Bruscantini was practically synonymous with buffo roles and he was born to sing Don Alfonso. Although this is toward the end of his career -- he was 63 at the time of this production -- and his voice is a little worn, he knows how to squeeze all the sly humor out of the role. (I loved it when he directed the young men to approach the other's inamorata when they return as the Albanian soldiers; I laughed along with the audience.)

The other principal character in this six-character opera is, of course, Despina, sung by Kathleen Battle. Her silvery voice, perfect trill, pert stage presence and expert comic timing make this a marvelous portrayal. Her appearance as 'il dottore' late in Act I is a comic turn by a master. (And that her costume echoes that of Don Alfonso is another of the little touches that points out the 'giuoco delle coppie' aspects of the opera.)  Her coaxing of the sisters in 'In uomine, in soldati' is done in fine style.

All in all, this is a delightful production. The sound is fine, although only available in LPCM stereo. Videography is clear and unobtrusive, with many close-ups that tend to flatter the singers rather than show us their tonsils. I loved this DVD.

2442373,5,B000BU997O,"At last! The directors of this production (the notorious Ursel and Karl-Ernst Herrmann of Idomeneo fame in this M22 collection) have decided to amend the proceedings of this unbelievably mysoginistic opera by having the two ladies HEARING the shameful plot of their boyfriends!

Just for this, the performance and this DVD would deserve five stars. Even if I reckon that some of Mozart's most beautiful music is played in Cosi, one must confess that the libretto is an embarrassment (my wife hates this opera with a vengeance). But with this simple spin of Fiordiligi and Dorabella knowing what goes on, the remaining 2h45 of the opera take a completely different take, and one can enjoy the plot - for the first time ever.

Not that the Hermanns' production should get away with it that easily: the huge grosses Festspielhaus is virtually empty for three hours, with just a dinosaur egg, a piano and some props. nothing more. As a result, one can imagine the talent that the six singers-actors have to display to keep the interest going...and here I must say that the work of every cast member is absolutely amazing and my ""5 stars"" is for them as well as for the ""plot trick"" already mentioned.
Let's start with the old guard: by now, Don Alfonso has become Thomas Allen's signature role and it is more and more difficult to imagine someone else in the part. This is fantastically sung and articulated all the way through: bravo. Casting Helen Donath as Despina implies that some day, some time, she and Alfonso may have been lovers (this is implied by Donath in the bonus interview). She brings all her experience in the role of Despina and depicts a frustrated, bitter old lady. The relationships with the two sisters and with Alfonso are extremely well-studied: fantastic.

The two men are simply great. Stphane Degout has a solid, burly barytone voice and Shawn Mathey is a delightful tenor: His ""un' aura amorosa"" is one of the most beautiful I have heard.

But frankly huge respect, bravi and admirations have to go to the two sisters: Ana-Maria Martinez and Sophie Koch act, dance, laugh, cry, play sports, and sing the bejesus out of this score with passion and lyricism. The ""come scoglio"" is legendary, the ""E amore un ladroncello"" phenomenal, and all the ensembles are simply magnificent.

There are a bit of annoyances here and there (the worst being the clash of swords at the beginning of the opera interfering with the overture) but for the rest it is a beautiful entry in the M22 collection. Too bad the ""Nozze"" wasn't quite up to the success of the other two Da Ponte operas.",1349481600,,2594,4.7555555555555555
2442374,4,B000BU997O,"Sometimes I think Ursel & Karl-Ernst Hermann are just full of crap. But in each of their productions I have seen so far, they do something makes me go ""Aha!"" So, I appreciate this production for the singing, the acting, the orchestral leadership, and the artifice that makes us think beyond the surface of the (pretty ridiculous) story.

Like many modern Cosis, there's a conscious directorial decision to create confusion. The four lovers like the idea of being with someone, but it's not clear if they are really meant to be with each other. Sometimes THEY can't even remember who is who. In ""Ah guarda, sorella,"" the sisters mix up their pictures and sing most of the duet to the ""wrong"" portrait. Later, in disguise, the men seem to forget which sister they are supposed to woo, and Alfonso has to remind them.

I like the twist that allows the sisters overhear their men making the bet with Alfonso and plotting to test them. Since there is nothing in the libretto to substantiate this, it puts the burden on the acting skills of the sisters. Their knowledge of Alfonso's plot is conveyed primarily by glances, smiles, and significant looks from behind their fans (which Sophie Koch and Ana Maria Martinez are very good at.) Stephane Degout and Shawn Mathey play the petulant lovers well.

This is a mature Despina. But she's the kind of woman (of a certain age) who would still call herself a girl, so I don't perceive a conflict with the text. (And Helen Donath still sounds pretty darned good in her 60s!)The continuo player is a 7th character, not only as an alter ego to each singer but as a presence right on stage with her fortepiano. I think this really works to reinforce the artifice of the production.

The finale of Cosi is ambiguous at best, and ripe for interpretation. Alfonso says the best revenge is to marry the sisters. But he never specifies who should marry whom. In the traditional interpretation, they should marry their original partners; but many have argued convincingly--based on both musical and dramatic analysis--that the new pairs are better matched; or they are better off not pairing up at all. This production definitely goes for ambiguity; as the lovers reconcile, we are not sure who is singing to whom.

Although sometimes it's a stretch to make the directors' alteration of the plot work, this Cosi Fan Tutte (one of the less weird M22 productions) is well sung and well acted.  The six singers shine in their arias, and do great ensemble work. I recommend it as an alternative to more ""traditional"" interpretations. It's a fresh look at an ambiguous and often troublesome plot that is paired with (and often contradicted by) sublime music.",1343865600,,2683,4.784017278617711
2442375,5,B000BU997O,"I was at this performance, so I'm severely prejudiced. I had not heard Marshall in person before and never Bruscantini in person, which was a great treat for me. Muti and Battle I  knew as fan who went backstage at their performances and talked to them, got their autographs, if that counts as 'knowing them'....Araiza and Morris I heard many times at the Met, especially Morris from the time he started at the Met...like 'homecoming' that night in Salzburg was. Wonderful memory that I can relive with this dvd. So, yes, my 5 stars are biased!",1329609600,2,544,4.666666666666667
2442376,4,B000BU997O,"This production is controversial visually, audibly great, and dramatically effective.
The visual controversy comes solely from the bare sets, and for me who neither reads nor write French, would bear it much better than the literate viewers, though the fire-extinguishers are a global device irrespective of the language.
That said, those relatively small problems would in no way hamper the real music lovers' enjoyment of this very good to wonderful performance.
The six leads are all good, with eminent and veteran ones in the persons of Raimondi and Bonney, and the highly popular and critically acclaimed Garanca in the role of Dorabella.
All the six characters not only sung well; they also acted well.  Probably the major drawback of this performance was not in its sets, but in its performance setting.
The actors/singers begin singing off the stage. Indeed, the characters stay off stage a good portion of the time during the performance, and it is easy to hear the imperfect accoustics and the impaired ensemble work resultant from this weird performance setting.
Apart from the 'bad parts', the goodies are still aplenty.
Barbara Bonney no longer in her prime, but she acted well and sung impeccably and convincingly as the sly Despina.  Erin Wall is young and elegant, and she sings with conviction.  Her role as Fiordiligi is by no means easy, as she has as a major vocal partner the star mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca, who not only has an exceptionally full voice, but also great musical and dramatic intelligence.  I totally agree with one reviewer here that owing to the 'true' mezzo timbre of Garanca, the ensemble works between Fiordiligi and Dorabella were being shown to greater musical advantage than other combinations.  And visually, too, both tall and elegant singers make a striking pair of sisters on stage.
The male duo is effective, if not outright brilliant.  Both are vocally sound and dramatically alert, but one misses the star pair of Ferrando/Gugliemo in the Vienna production 10 years before this, with Schade/Skovhus as the two fiance-soldiers.
Ruggero Raimondi still shines despite his age, and he is perhaps one of the most convincing 'grey-haired' Affonso whose wit and slyness played the pivotal part in the movement of the entire plot.
Daniel Harding was very young when he conducted this performance, but despite his youth, he displayed ample potential to rank among the best young conductors of the 21st century.

I'm European and I don't have any problem with a minimalistic approach, by some reviewers entitled as euro-trash. Provided, that is, that the music and singing are up to par. And to my taste, that is certainly the case in this production from the Salzburg festival.
I even think that this production deserves a compliment for having a very well-balanced cast of singers. All six of the main characters are in good voice, and what's more, they act properly. Opera, to me, is a sung play. What good is a stellar voice if it's paired with a wooden stage performance? One Joan Sutherland is more than enough...
In this production all the singers are acting all the time, with small gestures, looks, smiles and frowns. This brings me to an other strong point of this production: the direction/editing. Every one of these small gestures and looks is visible in close-up, even if that person is not the one singing at that particular moment.
And although I do agree with some (most) of the other reviewers that the idea of having the girls be aware of the masquerade does not go well together with the confusion that especially Fiordiligi experiences when she is being wooed, I still maintain this is a very enjoyable production of one of Mozart's most famous opera's.

Well that includes good singing, a good orchestra, and good stage visuals. I have a problems when the singers are barely dressed, and the stage consist of nothing but a giant egg. If the orchestra would have played and the singers would have come out well dressed and sang for the audience it would have been better. It is a shame since all singers were visually appealing and had great voices. I saw a Carmen at the Met with Ana Maria as Michaella. Franco Zeffirelli did the staging.

2442380,4,B000BU997O,"I can sign on to most of the criticisms made by reviewers with regard to the conception, production values, direction, scenic design and costuming of this Mozart 22 presentation. They create a considerable drag on the efforts of Mozart and DaPonte to give us a pleasurable evening of opera. However, I found the vocal component to be, on the whole , first rate and, almost against my will, ended up enjoying the event. However, if you are buying and not viewing on the cheap, you might be better advised to go with one or more of the many alternative versions available. Among them, the Muti La Scala version was quite a happy choice (heard it last week), mostly because it approached the opera with a desire to emphasize the joy of the original rather than the predilections of the current production staff.",1242432000,,808,4.697183098591549
2442381,4,B000BU997O,"Admittedly, the unconventional staging of this Cos performance leaves some loose ends, but I find the concept of including the women in the ""joke"" from the start has a certain appeal which is not completely outside the suggestions of the original libretto.  For instance, the very first recitative sung by the women begins with Fiordiligi stating that she has a notion that she'd like to play a joke on Guglielmo today (""Mi par, che stamattina rolontieri farei la pazzarella: ho un certo foco, un certo pizzi cor entro le vene quando Guglielmo viene se sapessi, che burla gli vo far."").

The disadvantage to the approach is that things do get a bit muddled in the second act, as Herrmann attempts to reconcile her view of the plot with Fiordiligi's angst-ridden attempt to disguise herself and leave town to join Guglielmo at the battlefront, and to clearly portray the double-revelation of the betrayal by both the male and female lovers after the ""wedding ceremony"" has taken place.  While to most modern viewers it should be quite obvious that both the men and the women fiances have betrayed one another's faith, simply by the fact that Guglielmo has successfully seduced Dorabella, while Ferrando has likewise seduced Fiordiligi (whether the consummation of that seduction is delicately implied, as in many productions, or stated more blatantly, as in this one), still, most productions of this work leave the women as the betrayers and the men as the betrayed.

Herrmann's attempt to rectify this injustice requires that many of the accusations made by the women against the men come by way of angry glances and physical rebuffs, rather than spoken words, although a careful viewing reveals that the message is successfully conveyed (if perhaps a little too subtly for some viewers' tastes).  The quartet, ""Idol mio se questo  vero,"" in the final scene allows for a fairly ample amount of contrition from the men as well as the women before the entire cast takes up the final theme, ""Fortunato l'uom, che prende ogni cosa pel buon verso,"" praising the happiness obtained from taking life as it comes with good cheer.

Da Ponte's story itself, though often treated as a buffoonish lark, displays a rather disturbingly dark view of human nature, fraught with emotional conflict, seduction, betrayal, love, hate, misogyny, and an almost sociopathic readiness to trifle with the emotions and happiness of others.  Herrmann does succeed in drawing forth a great deal of that confusion, darkness and incipient violence in this stunning retake, going well beyond the light frolic of many other performances and leaving the audience with a sense of unease and a thought-provoking aura of uncertainty.  There are no ""pat answers"" in this performance, but a good deal of entertainment, some lovely musical performances, and quite a brilliant shift in perspective.",1202256000,8,2859,5.0918803418803416
2442382,3,B000BU997O,"Vietato fumare!  That means, ""No smoking.""  What's that got to do with Cosi Fan Tutte? you ask.  It's featured in prominent letters on the back wall of the set.  Along with telephones and fire extinguishers that nobody bothered to cover in this period rendition of Cosi Fan Tutte.  We can thank Richard Peduzzi for the sets.  What sets???  Where is the scenery? Sheesh!!! I think this is an insult.  Along the lines of ""Too many notes...""  I wonder if the people in the audience got a discount on their tickets to compensate for the missing essential element.  A minimal set would have been okay.  This was no set at all!!!

I found this very distracting.  I've seen many Cosi's and so I knew there was a boat and a sea and a garden and rooms, etc., but what if you were seeing this for the first time?

Fortunately, Mozart's music is beautiful in any setting and the singers in this production were all good.  I particularly liked Erin Wall as Fiordiligi and Shawn Mathey as Ferrando.  Barbara Bonney as Despina seems an odd choice.  She sang it well enough but she didn't make me laugh.  Actually, nothing about this opera made me laugh, including the usually funny, slapstick poisoning scene.

This production is okay for the music and singing but I already have a good Cosi cd.  I will probably never watch it again, so I can't recommend it to anyone else.  There are two super Cosi's available if you need a suggestion:  The Gardiner Chatelet production with Amanda Roocroft and Rodney Gilfry and the Hytner Glyndebourne Cosi with Luca Pisaroni, Topi Lehtipuu, Miah Persson, etal.  They both offer the complete spectacle of opera:  music, singing, acting, scenery, direction.  And you can smoke if you like.",1189900800,21,1712,4.702702702702703

8092862,5,B000BU997O,"There are elements of Eurotrash in this outdoor Aix-en-Provence summer opera production. Nevertheless, the splendid singing and acting transform the story, normally treated as farce, into something considerably more serious. As many other critics have noted, the young lovers have not yet sorted everything out as this performance ends.  Act One begins with the principal characters running around in the outdoor theater -- while the audience takes it in as if they had been advised to sit back and enjoy the novelty.  Very likely they were also asked to refrain from applauding at the end of arias and ensemble pieces, in which the three-hour opera abounds.  This makes for the fastest and most satisfying Cosi I have ever seen or heard.  Mozart's musical magic is well served by soloists, chorus, orchestra, conductor, and stage director.",1470182400,,840,5.2

Cast your minds back to 1970  so long ago, the Garden. Helen Donath was lauded for her youthful voice in Karajans Meistersingers from Dresden. Here she is, some thirty six later, cast as Despina  not Marcellina  Despina. As Dennis Hopper would fume, Its just wrong man  plain, dumb wrong! How ordinary she is in Alla bella Despinetta.

Sophie Koch as Dorabella, for reasons best known to herself, imitates a whale-shark at feeding-time when she sings- God help any plankton and krill that come into range lest they be sucked into that enormous mouth! I have never seen anything like it. That being said, shes easy on the eye and Im glad she chose this career over alternatives.

Sir Thomas Allen has been a fine singer over time but here, caked under so many layers of ghastly make-up and sporting a fishbone mullet, he resembles the Toxic Avenger on a bad hair day. He sings well enough even if one cannot look at him for more than five seconds. While its nice to receive proof of life after death, one does not need it in this context.

The other singers are average at best. Theres no real sense of ensemble (Soave sia il vento is dead-on-arrival). The Vienna Philharmonic  and it might have been the B-team on the night  phones in its performance. The production itself is splatter-gun and slapdash. Needless to say, it eschews tradition to revel in dream-chaos.

There is another. Muti recorded K 588 in 1982 for EMI. It was studio-bound in every sense. A year later at the Salzburg Festival, with substantially the same cast, gestation is evident (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cosi-Fan-Tutte/dp/B004F29WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cosi Fan Tutte</a>).

8092869,5,B000BU997O,"So, there are three DVDs available of Mozart's Cosi fan tutte conducted by Muti: this 1983 Salzburg production is the first, then in 1989 the La Scala, and 1995 the Vienna.
I have seen the 1995 Vienna production, and must say that it is about the BEST DVD of Cosi fan tutte!
Here, we have Muti in probably his first 'outing' of this work, and in Salzburg.
He has a group of capable (if not better than the Vienna production of 1995) soloists.  The men side largely equalled the ladies' side: Araiza's Ferrando, Morris' Gugliemo, Bruscantini's Alfonso; Murray's Dorabella, Marshall's Fiordiligi and Battle's Despina.
If you compare this cast with Muti's 1995 Vienna cast (Schade's Ferrando, Skovhus' Gugliemo, Corbelli's Alfonso; Kirchschlager's Dorabella, Frittoli's Fiordiligi and Bacelli's Despina), I would say that the 1995 cast is a tad better than this 1983 cast, especially in the ladies' side.
Even so, we have some exceptionally good performances here, and it is principally in Anne Murray's Dorabella, and Francisco Araiza's Ferrando.
Murray edges out Kirchschlager in the Vienna production by a more expressive and colourful vocal performance. While Michael Schade actually is a terrific Ferrando, Araiza's singing is again a tad more refined, and his acting equally effective as Schade's.
Morris I find a bit wooden in his acting (as compared to Boje Skovhus), and Bruscantini less of a vocal actor than Corbelli.
Kathleen Battle, however, has a clear edge over Monica Bacelli as Despina.
Then we have Fiordiligi, one of the most difficult Mozartian soprano roles to pull off.  Frittoli definitely outshines Margaret Marshall, though the latter is by no means second-rate.
It is always a big shame that not all the solo numbers are being included on DVD like Muti's, especially when the singing casts are so exceptional.",1351555200,2,1832,5.164983164983165
