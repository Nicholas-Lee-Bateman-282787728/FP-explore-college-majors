8755147,5,B01D7A2KU2,"This film was enormously popular in France, so much so that a few movie houses played it simultaneously.  Just about everything in the film is fake and deliberately so.  The ""jungle"" was shot in an airplane hangar and the non-professional actors spoke in untitled Japanese.  The director, the great von Sternberg, explained the actions BEFORE they occured so that the audience could savor the fabulous visuals.  And it was shot in black and white. The plot is simple, the camera work has to be seen to be believed, and the music is missing.  This is definitely THE director's film throughout and well worth viewing.

8755148,5,B01D7A2KU2,"This had been a holy grail film for me for many years, mostly from reading ""Chicago Reader"" film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum's descriptions of it.... it sounded like a truly sui generis film:  Japanese soldiers stranded on desert island during World War II and reverting to barbarism, with one woman who slowly begins to wield a power over all of them, in a film told entirely with quite artificial-looking sets and unsubtitled dialogue, with the director narrating, made in Japan when Sternberg couldn't get it produced in Hollywood...a completely uncommercial film from a frustrated, bitter middle-aged director tired of fighting the studio bigwigs, determined to make a truly personal film whatever the cost.

I finally located a pretty decent copy several months ago - from the same print as near as I can tell as this unofficial release - and watched it last night, and I must say it equalled or even exceeded by expectations -- this really is a film experience like nothing else out there. The black and white photography and sound, even on a somewhat soft and slightly fuzzy transfer, are just stunning; the sound design in particular is worthy of David Lynch, and really the film as a whole is one of the weirdest American features to be released before ERASERHEAD.  Sternberg's Brooklyn-accented narration interacts in all kinds of ways with the action on screen, sometimes anticipating events, sometimes contradicting what we see, sometimes questioning, often ironic...the hermetic world created on the soundstage is obviously unreal, and yet the lush beauty of the photography and sets creates a unique otherworld as powerful as anything in the massive-budgeted 'scope spectacles that would be Hollywood's bread-and-butter for the next decade. It's as if Sternberg knew where American film was headed, and told us he could do something much more interesting at a fraction the price.

I'm not sure my comments are at all meaningful, this is a hard film to wrap my head around...suffice it to say I recommend it as strongly as possible to those that any kind of interest in the director, or the byways of American film.  One of the key films in the history of American independent films and probably my favorite film from this great director.  It desperately needs an official, quality release, preferably on Criterion or another major specialist label who will give it the attention it deserves.",1258243200,24,2403,5.0708860759493675
