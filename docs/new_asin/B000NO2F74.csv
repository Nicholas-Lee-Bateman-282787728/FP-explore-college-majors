8400380,5,B000NO2F74,"Great video, and shows a lot of the resort, though Hualalai is even more lovely in person than it is in this video.  Definetly worth checking out if you are considering Hualalai, you will be glad that you did or you may buy it just to relive your memory there.  While the video is a couple of years old, it is still largely accurate, with the exception of a few enhancements made at the resort spa, beach tree grill and suites.",1248307200,,427,4.2592592592592595
