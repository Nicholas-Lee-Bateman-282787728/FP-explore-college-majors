1432301,3,B00005JIKU,This video only plays on our Mac.  It will not play on our Blu-ray or other DVD player.  It is a European pressing and is not compatible with regular US devices. The production is fine but if you don't want to watch it on your computer be very careful about ordering this DVD.  I may have missed this qualification but I don't think it was mentioned on the product site.,1349049600,4,370,4.257142857142857
1432302,5,B00005JIKU,"Carmina Burana is one of the most popular pieces of classical music to emerge from the 20th century. The iconic opening and closing song ""O Fortuna"" is a staple of dramatic soundtracks; it has been used over and over in films, on TV, and elsewhere. It's a perennial favorite on symphony schedules.

And yet most people do not get to enjoy the full experience. It's often performed as a choral-orchestral work, but it was originally intended to be staged with sets, costumes, and action to complement the music. This DVD delivers all of that, coupled with an excellent vocal cast and orchestra. The quality of the soundtrack is outstanding; the transfer of the original production to digital format seems to have been done quite well; the colors are lush. (* One caveat - this DVD is in PAL format and will not play on most American DVD players. I can only play it through my computers.)

This version has features that enhance the performance. Subtitles in several language choices make it possible to understand what the singers are singing about without having to understand Latin. Considering the at times hallucinogenic imagery of the staging, that's not a bad thing! Orff's setting of medieval songs about love, lust, despair, drinking, vice and virtue, the vicissitudes of fate are coupled with costuming and characters in settings that Hieronymus Bosch would recognize.

A bonus is an interview in which an unseen Carl Orff talks about his life, growing up in Germany, his experiences in the theater and music. It's set to a slide show of photos. Unfortunately, it seems the subtitles stop running a few minutes into the talk. Unless you know German, you'll have to make do with looking at the pictures, some of which are quite striking.

I originally saw this production some time in the 1970s by intercepting a Canadian TV broadcast of the show Musicamera. Even in black and white I was blown away by the production. It was my first real introduction to Carmina Burana. I've spent the last few decades wondering if I would ever be able to see it again. I'm glad it's now available on DVD - I just hope a version compatible with American video formats will be made available soon - it deserves a wider audience in this country.",1339545600,7,2235,4.782383419689119
1432303,5,B00005JIKU,"This 1975 version of Carmina Burana, filmed under the watchful eye of the composer is a pure delight.  It is also a wonderful product of the time, that wears the era of the 70's well.  The incredible voices of the youthful Hermann Prey, and the purely beautiful Lucia Popp is an especial treasure.  The major players in the cast have now passed on, so to see them in this robust, lustful production is a treat.  The direction of the great Jean Pierre Ponnelle adds spice to this irreverent play of medieval morals and manners, with graphic humor and exquisite technicolor; the height of cinematic color at the time.  Carl Orff's use of profane texts demonstrate to us that our ancestors were full-blooded, truely human people, not just religious and filled with piety or mere drones of misery.  Relax, enjoy and rejoice in the bumbling finesse of this great work, that introduced many of us to the the vast world of early music through modern composition.",1328054400,4,955,4.757575757575758
1432304,5,B00005JIKU,"This is an older version of Carmina Burana performed by the Munich Rundfunks Orchestra and the Chorus of the Bavarian Rundfunks opera. As such, it is musically very sound, with good solid performances. In my version, there are a couple of small sound glitches, which are irritating, but only happened twice and only for under a second.

My version, although region 0, would not play on my BluRay DVD player, but played well through my computer. The aforementioned sound glitches might be attributable to using the computer rather than a DVD player.

In terms of video content, parental guidance might be in order here. The director decided to feature the lusty aspects of the music and lyrics, and since this was originally created for German television, it has a few scenes that some North Americans might find inappropriate, although mild compared to most modern movies.

Three of us, all very familiar with the music, watched the video and enjoyed it very much. A bonus on the disk is the picture documentation of the production, and an interview with Carl Orff available in English, German, French, and Italian.",1325203200,7,1115,4.951871657754011
1432305,4,B00005JIKU,"This is a 1995-ZDF Production of Carmina Burana by Carl Orff. It is both magnificent and beautiful. The music, the voices, and the scenaries are very good. The production is partly theatrical and partly operatic. I highly recomend it for any music and opera lover.",1308787200,7,264,4.888888888888889
1432306,1,B00005JIKU,"do not buy this dvd , unless you have a PAL (european) standard dvd player and a PAL tv.

This dvd does not play on US NTSC standard tvs.

The seller does not say that on the website. I got stuck with this dvd. The seller did not respond to my emails.

You may be able to get it to play on some computer dvd players (not all).",1303948800,21,326,3.764705882352941
1432307,3,B00005JIKU,The recording was good as were the images. The major problem was two regions on the disk where the audio and video both shut down for a few seconds. Probably an inferior pressing.,1300406400,,179,4.454545454545454
1432308,5,B00005JIKU,"I saw this when I was about ten (which is many decades ago) on TV and it made a huge impression. Recently caught up with it again on youtube, and found I had remembered it pretty well perfectly. Of course at that age, I had no idea what it was, and it wasn't until I saw Boorman's Excalibur some years later, that connections started to occur.

This is well worth a look, combining great medieval visuals with Orff's fantastic music. A lot of inspiration is clearly drawn from the works of Bosch and Breughel, giving it an art like quality to many of the scenes and tableaux. If you can afford it, get it, put on some incense, light some candles and grab some wine and your significant other and watch it!",1297987200,5,705,4.340909090909091
1432309,4,B00005JIKU,"Was there ever a more misunderstood piece of music in the modern era than Orff's magnificent orchestration?  When I cruise Youtube is seems as if every teenage boy or wannabe director has attached Carmina Burana to some large epic scale battle or huge scene dealing with epic violence and heroics.

Folks, this music, and specifically this film, was meant to celebrate the miracle of life and the fun we can have living by loving the one who's capture your heart (or invigorated your loins for the present time).

It's a play on the angsty uptight religious orders, and meant to explain why we live for one another.

This film specifically does that as well, and is aimed at showing us in almost an interpretive dance kind of way of what fun it is to embrace your object of affection.  The results of that, and why we should, for time is short and you only get so much of it.  Spend this commodity wisely for fate grabs us all in the end.  But spend and enjoy.

That's all the piece is about.  That's what this film is about.

There are no battles.  There is no bloodshed.  There're no heroics.  There's just life and love.

There's tons of sexual imagery, but then again that's sort of what the music and film are all about.  Just enjoy it for what it is, and understand the time and environment out of which it came.  By today's standards it's a little pase or prozaic, but back then this was leading edge avante-garde cinema, and done with some classical music.

Enjoy.",1283212800,18,1472,4.494339622641509
7938753,3,B00005JIKU,"To write this review I had to separate, in my mind, the audio from the visual.  The audio performance is great - five star.  Lucia Popp, Hermann Prey, John van Kesteren, the orchestra and chorus all gave great performances.  The visual imaging, in contrast, I found strange --- the lip synching was markedly off.  There was lots of gratuitous nudity.  And I found some of the tableaus (the only term I can think of to describe the succession of scenes) to be weird and not quite appropriate to the music.  The English subtitles were fine.  The image clarity was fine and the sound quality was very good.  As noted by others this DVD will not play on standard North American DVD players",1507334400,,685,4.557377049180328
