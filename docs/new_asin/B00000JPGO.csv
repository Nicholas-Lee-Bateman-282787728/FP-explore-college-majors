7913062,5,B00000JPGO,"I love this movie! I saw it when I was in Austria, learning German. It's a gem of a story and the cinematography is genius; you can't help but be drawn in. The quality is a little lacking, but considering that it's foreign and from the 60s AND subtitled, hey, it's superb. Being drawn into the story, you'll stop noticing the ""bad quality"" of the VHS or what have you. Oh, and the English title is not the best choice. The literal translation of the German title is ""Chess Novel"" and the man was never brainwashed--although he did lose sanity. Anywho, I don't want to give much more away. Watch and enjoy.",1329177600,3,605,4.410714285714286
7913063,5,B00000JPGO,"Although the film quality leaves something to be desired, this is a movie well worth owning. The black and white medium is perfect for both the plot and the suspense. Since this was a German/Austrian film it received very little exposure in the US. Both the acting, especially Curt Jurgens, and directing are fabulous.",1123545600,6,318,4.907407407407407
7913064,4,B00000JPGO,"The English title of this film is a poor choice. If anything, the hero of this video, through extraordinary effort resists ""brainwashing."" The story is based upon a novella by Stephan Zweig called ""The Royal Game."" For anyone who enjoys chess, the royal game, the Zweig work is simply fascinating. The movie captures much of Zweig's story and Jurgens' performance is rivoting. He plays an Austrian aristrocrat who is captured by the Nazis early in the 2nd world war. They seek to extract information from him by an exotic form of torture ... sensory deprivation. They reason that an intellectual will withstand physical torture better than mental torture and appear to succeed until Jurgens finds a treasure that helps him keep his sanity ... he finds a book of the 100 best games of Alexhine and studies them intensively. By playing them repeatedly he is able to excape into the world of chess and resist interrogation until the Nazis give up and release him. His story is interwoven with that of an idiot savant, the then world chess champion. If the viewer develops an affection for the story, as I did, she must read the Zweig novella where the champion's story is more completely developed. This is a fine adaptation of an intriguing work of fiction. Fortunately, Jurgens character escapes where Zweig did not.",975715200,13,1315,4.875
