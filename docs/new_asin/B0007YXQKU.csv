8054233,5,B0007YXQKU,"Family Under Siege is a film about a family being held hostage. This film reminded me of a Lifetime Channel version of the movie Firewall (w/ Harrison Ford). Aside from that, performances from Melinda Clarke (The O.C.) and Derek Hamilton (Ripper) shine over the performances of the rest of the cast. Some parts were predictable, due to watching hostage situation movies made after this one. :)",1342656000,,393,4.96969696969697
