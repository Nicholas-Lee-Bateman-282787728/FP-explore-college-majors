4641141,2,B005AMJ3EW,I agree with the previous rating. The quality is pretty terrible and there were times that the dialogue was too jumbled to understand. I can't actually find a movie of Humphrey Bogart's on here as it says on the box. I doubt I'll open the last two dvds that have 80s movies on them.,1385251200,21,282,4.2407407407407405
4641142,2,B005AMJ3EW,"As might be assumed from the price for the 60 movies included (actually 62 movies on ten discs in the product I received) they are from public domain sources of not very good quality.  By way of comparison, the older films are poorer quality than their Alpha Video counterparts, which are themselves only average.  The older ones are packed up to eight movies per side, shortened in length and apparently digitally compressed to fit, even using dual-layer recording.  Better viewing of these movies is available on any of the TV movie channels.  Even the newer ones from the 70's and 80's are not good quality.  I would only buy this pack to obtain the rarer titles included (few of them are critically rated better than two stars, however).  Particularly disappointing are the very old ones (Vanity Fair with Myrna Loy, etc.), which are barely watchable.",1327276800,62,855,4.862068965517241

8463415,3,B005AMJ3EW,"I have not finished the set yet, but so far it is well below expectations. The quality of the films is very poor. Had I known how bad I would not have purchased it.",1492819200,,164,3.8529411764705883
8463416,5,B005AMJ3EW,"some films are not focused well enough to enjoy them.. if only  you could see, it would
be a fantastic box.",1490572800,,107,4.095238095238095
8463417,3,B005AMJ3EW,"I must have miss read something. I thought they were all old Hollywood movies (50's/60s and earlier), but some are more recent. I only like old movies so I was a little disappointed, but that's just a personal preference. Still a good buy for the price.",1490400000,,253,4.521739130434782
8463418,2,B005AMJ3EW,The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is 3 of the films are duplicated on two of the dvds.,1490140800,2,93,3.4761904761904763

8463421,4,B005AMJ3EW,"Quite a few of these movies are obscure, but still a pretty good purchase for the price. I understand that it would take effort, but listings of Collector's Editions' contents would truly help when choosing the right collections to buy.",1468195200,5,236,4.925
