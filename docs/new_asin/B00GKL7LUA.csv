In the movie, Ann Miller plays Terry Baxter, a Kansas girl who wins a trip to Hollywood. She hopes to get a job as a tap dancer, but winds up working as a secretary for producer George Carter Haven (played by Jess Barker) instead. Eventually, she gets in trouble, loses her job, and is even arrested at one point, but all's well that ends well: she gets to perform a big production number called ""Victory Polka"" at the end of the film. The format is similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reveille-with-Beverly/dp/B005QQWH54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reveille with Beverly</a>. Six big bands appear in performance segments (some in ""soundies"" video segments, some live, others in recording-session sequences): Louis Armstrong (don't call him Louie!), Charlie Barnet (of ""Cherokee"" fame), Glen Gray, Jan Garber, Alvino Rey (of ""talking guitar"" fame; he was married to Louise King of The King Sisters: baby boomers remember their mid-'60s variety series, THE KING FAMILY, of which&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-Christmas-special/dp/B006OFDPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a Christmas special</a>&nbsp;and two other collections (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Television-Specials-Collection-Volume-One/dp/B00HNTOT4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Television Specials Collection Volume One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-Classic-Television-Specials-Volume-2/dp/B00MR9HO74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas: Classic Television Specials Volume 2</a>) are available on DVD), and Teddy Powell, along with vocalist Nan Wynn, and the vocal group The Pied Pipers (formerly with Tommy Dorsey's band). Annie Miller is brilliant, as always; while the plot is thin, the music is great. One of the scenes, where Terry Baxter, with help from a very talented makeup artist who lives in her apartment building, disguises herself as an old lady to audition for a film part (Baxter [Miller] does a brief, fast ""a cappella"" tap solo that blows the studio executives away), was edited into The Monkees' movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head/dp/6305038694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head</a>. That scene became a favorite of Monkees fans, as the reunited group (sadly, minus the late Davy Jones) used it as one of the film clips on their 2013 tour.

If Sony Pictures Entertainment can regain the copyright, JAM SESSION - like REVEILLE WITH BEVERLY - should be given a proper release on DVD, either through Sony's own made-to-order Choice Collection series, or Warner Archives' Columbia Classics series. Both movies are currently airing (April 2014) on the getTV digital channel, and the prints do come from Sony Pictures Television, which owns getTV, so official DVDs may be coming soon.

My overall rating is the same as for REVEILLE WITH BEVERLY: 4 stars for the movie itself, but only 2 stars for picture quality, which averages out to 3 stars.",1394928000,2,3746,6.548387096774194
