6136823,5,B00H7BJ1DW,Downloaded this for my 18 month old daughter for a long car ride. She LOVES Dora and Dora in Wonderland especially! Great songs with great guest stars :),1396828800,,153,4.5
6136824,5,B00H7BJ1DW,"I'm not a fan of Dora but my daughter loves ""Book Explorers"" and is constantly singing the song from that episode. So I just had to get this for her :)",1395705600,,151,3.903225806451613
6136825,5,B00H7BJ1DW,"With my daughter loving Dora the Explorer and me loving Alice in Wonderland, I'd say this DVD was a good compromise.  She wouldn't understand Alice in Wonderland yet, but this title she adored!  The hour-long movie isn't scary or confusing for kids, there is mischief but its all in good fun.  There are great lessons for kids as usual in Dora stories, such as behaving and asking politely to move aside.  There are songs in both English and Spanish as well.  My daughter loved this title though because of the new friends on the show and that it was longer than regular Dora episodes.  While this has been aired on television I love that we can watch it whenever we want, wherever we want.  It is a great addition to any child's DVD collection.",1394928000,4,745,4.514925373134329
