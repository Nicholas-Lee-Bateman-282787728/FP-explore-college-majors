7849405,5,6303522718,"There can be no doubt in my mind that this small independent thriller more than reached its potential. The two leads- Stacy dash and Dan Gauthier had an incredible chemistry together- a chemistry seldom seen in Hollywood.

SPOILER ALERT!!

Stacy Dash plays Kerry Truitt (Nee Lennox), a well-off lounge singer who has recently inherited 25 million from her murdured husband. But Kerry has a past. She is seeking the killer(s) of her kid sister and will stop at nothing until she is avenged.

Dan Gauthier plays Chris Morgan, a good cop (Rare These Days) who has found himself in the middle of a sesspool of departmental corruption. The DA and his lieutenant-even his own-lawyer seem to want to get him to say he didn't see what he saw (Cops Stealing Drug Money). Having taken personal leave, Morgan is driving a cab to supplement his income when he is flagged down by the beautiful Kerry Truitt. She stiffs him his fare, and runs off into the night, only to be coincidentally seen by Morgan a day or so later. Revealing himself as a cop, Morgan gets his money and then leaves, leaving Kerry puzzled and interested in the handsome cop.

The story gets more interesting as the plot continues. Suffice it to say that Stacey Dash shines in this role, perhaps her best ever. The love scenes she has with her co-star are incredible. Seldom has there been such intensity between two stars in a small, independent film. With the exception of In The Cold Of The Night (See My Amazon Review), none can compare.

""...I could get a man to do anything."" ""...I look so good when I wore blue that I was dangerous."" Those are just two partial quotes delivered by Stacey Dash in this suspensful thriller that I couldn't get enough of. This begs the question of why this movie was never released onto DVD? It is so frustrating not to be able to have such an entertaining picture available to me. It could be that the film was released by the now defunct Orion Pictures, but it was owned and controlled by Warner Brothers, so that excuse rings hollow. If anyone is reading this review from Warner Brothers or any rights holder from Hollywood, please release this onto DVD!

This weeks choice Illegal in Blue goes back as far as Death Ring in the Sid's vintage movie vault. We came across this one all the way back in 1995 late night on The Movie Channel. The only factor that led us to keep it on was the promise of a sexy time with Stacey Dash, which it did deliver. Folks what you are looking at here is the roots of what began Sid the Elf's journey into the world of b. We owe a lot to the awful cinema pumped out in the 90's and have to honor it with this classic Santa pick.

The film starts out with hot shot ex-cop Chris Morgan, whose biggest film outside this one was along side the weasel himself Pauly Shore in Son-In-Law. Chris has gotten himself booted off the force for investigating crooked cops and moonlights as a taxi driver where he meets Kari Truitt (Stacey Dash). She bails on paying him the cab fare which somehow leads to them getting together and having a sexy time, in true soft-core fashion. As his obsession begins he comes to find out her husband was murdered. On a daily basis Kari gives him obvious hints that she is the one who killed her husband but he won't act on it due to the fact he's into her. The film goes all over the place in a confusing yet hilarious fashion and we have a whole lot of love scenes between the two. Just another terrible soft-core 90's cop drama which would have been a complete zero without Stacey gracing the screen.

Despite how weak the movie was we still has a blast watching it. In typical fashion we found plenty of ways to crack up and reminisce about the days of discovering b. It was truly enjoyable to come across a film with the same value as Death Ring On Demand. Simply stunning! In no way can we recommend this one as a good film but can be enjoyed under the right context. Man did this one take it back, doo doo do do take it baaaaack.",1240444800,,1952,4.161375661375661
7849407,4,6303522718,"Stacey Dash is one of the most beautiful women in film - and she needs to be given better roles and more opportunities. She has it all - beauty, intelligence, and the acting chops to go along with them.  This is a fairly standard mystery drama, but it's elevated by its intense love scenes, which are quite realistic and erotic.  And Dash even sings in the film, to good effect. She is a true beauty and a good director and writer would give her the opportunity to show her skills. Think of how good she was in ""Clueless"" (and not used enough in that film either). She's just as good here.  Maybe she needs her own TV series for more people to see her talent. If you're a fan, you will enjoy this film.  It's fast-paced, well produced, with some of the best love scenes I've seen in a film in quite some time. There's real chemistry between the stars. Stacey, you're beautiful and you're sexy, and you rock!",1151539200,7,907,4.349112426035503
