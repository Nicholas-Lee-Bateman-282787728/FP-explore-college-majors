The content of this DVD was good.  It focused on how we are to get justice in our lives in the spiritual real.  It really opened my eyes to why I hadn't been getting justice because I wasn't asking good but assumed that I would get it just because.  John relayed it to our American justice system, which helped me to better understand.

I need to watch the DVD again and take good notes the next time.",1309996800,2,572,4.154545454545454
8373108,5,B002LHG8HE,"I found this set to be a very powerful and uplifting teaching that came into my life at the right time. JPJ teaches about Justice, GOD's Justice, what it is, how GOD Loves Justice and that Justice is one of the Pillars of GOD's Throne. JPJ boldly states if you do NOT get Justice then there is NO Throne in Heaven. One of GOD's names is the GOD of Justice, it is GOD's Character to render Justice to his children. Drawing of several scriptures, JPJ creates an enviornment where the listener now can Believe and Trust GOD NOW for justice against the wrongs in their lives and the lives of others and this point is important. This is the KINGDOM, to destroy the works of the Devil and bring SOZO,LIFE, to all.
  How many times have you had things happen to you or others and said ""This is just not RIGHT"" well get this set and being to see beyond this veil into the KINGDOM and how GOD desires to give us Justice. No longer the victim you can call on the Heavenly Father and according to HIS will and Desire demand Justice, it is our heritage and HIS Character to give it. There is so much more but my recommendation is get it, be blessed and start seeking GOD and Believing. GOD bless you JB",1293148800,11,1190,4.261061946902655
