7827513,3,6302563488,"I viewed this on a DVD from the Los Angeles Public Library.

Amazing historical piece of Hollywood science fiction history.

Hopefully, it will get re-issued on DVD and be available on AMAZON. You can certainly see how George Lucas ""borrowed"" may elements for STAR WARS. The themes and icons are similar!!!!

Love the hokey special effects like the limping fire cracker rockets. But this fascinated kids and even as an adult I got wrapped up in the adventure, including space rockets. Man, I would love a Director's Commentary on this story!!! Ancient Hollywood History here.",1093564800,,575,5.031578947368421
