6968323,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"From Warner Bros. and director Clint Eastwood is the story of Chris Kyle who started off as a cowboy and then enlists in the Navy after the September 11th attacks in New York City. While stationed in Fallujah he becomes one of the most deadliest snipers in U.S. history. We follow Chris as he feels the effects of war and the thought of losing those around him. And while raising a family at home it isn't so easy for his wife Debbie who worries she nor her kids will ever see their father again. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Kyle Gallner, Sienna Miller, and Ben Reed in a powerful look on the effects of war and the sacrifice to keep those you love safe.

Director Clint Eastwood has had hit or miss moments when it comes to film-making as was the case with Jersey Boys this past year. However, when it comes to American Sniper its safe to say he pulls off a winner with a strong actor in Bradley Cooper and a gripping journey to the very end. The life of Chris Kyle is that of a man who became one of the most lethal snipers who by the end of his fourth tour had taken 16o lives. But its not a record hes pleased about as the sole purpose of his duty is to protect his fellow comrades on the battlefield. And with the cost of war comes the physical and mental toll where one is to develop post traumatic stress. As the film depicts, we see Chris change every time he comes home from war and all he can think about are his brothers back in the Middle East.

To play the role of Chris Kyle couldn't have been better with Bradley Cooper who is amazing in this film. I bought his character and could subtlety notice the changes in his character every time he would return back home to his wife Debbie, played by Sienna Miller. And what I liked about the directors choice to use sound and visuals to expose the damage that war has taken on Coopers character pulls a reaction out of you. You could sympathize with him after even taking the life of a young child whos innocent and is only brainwashed by the extremists. There were some intense moments in the film that were disturbing in nature but is exactly whats going on in todays society. One scene in particular that made me sit silent was when a family was attacked by a man called The Butcher and the child is tortured right in front of the family. And it was the way he was tortured that was hard to fathom and cannot imagine the real horrors that go on in war.

I enjoyed Eastwoods structure of the film by starting with Coopers character already at war and then starting back to when he was brought up by his father. Then we see him eventually getting married and then entering the Navy Seals. And from then on the film shifts back to back from war to being home. We get to see the different mindsets of Chris that reveals the stresses and anxieties that follows him every day of his life. In the early onset his wife is having an ultrasound as Chris just came back from his first tour of duty. What looks like a calm Chris turns out his blood pressure is off the charts and is something you couldn't tell from the naked eye. Even his wife gets concerned and hasn't sunk in of what war has done to her husband.

The great thing about the movie is that it will attract audiences with different tastes as the movie has a little bit of drama, action, suspense, and a strong performance by Bradley Cooper. Theres an equal balance between the two that benefits the film and the audience because of how well-paced the film is. And a great performance by Sienna Miller as Debbie who really showed how much she loved her husband and stuck with him even when in doubt. Its difficult to discern the criticisms within the film because of it being real life accounts; however, I found it unusual to see Cooper play the sniper early on in the movie and then be taken to ground-level where hes fighting on foot. I get it that it helps to keep the audiences attention by creating action but we mostly see Chris sniping at people from the beginning rather then balanced throughout. In the end were told how many people hed killed but doesnt feel like so when your seeing him shoot from the ground rather then in the air. But other then that you get the gist of what he did and how he became the legend that everyone thought he was.

If your going into this with low expectations due to Clint Eastwoods off and on record I highly suggest checking out American Sniper because its one of his better films. Its gripping, suspenseful and will showcase Bradley Coopers amazing talents as an actor. A telling story of the cost of war and how many of our soldiers return from war having to reclaim the life they leave behind.",1421366400,3,4659,4.326086956521739
6968324,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I saw the preview on television and loved what I saw. I was really looking forward to the dvd release-until I read the IMDb parents guide. There are ""60 to 70"" ""F"" words in one form or another throughout the movie. I was SO disappointed because I wanted so much to see it. I cannot watch a movie with all that foul language. The fact that the ""F"" word is used is bad enough but it is WAY over-used. Just what is the point of that?  As for the violence, I expected that since it is a war movie about a sniper but even some of it is over done.  I entertained the thought of reading the book, but it probably has vulgar language as well.  It's really sad that so many movies are full of four letter words. Movies can be very well done without the swearing.  I know of some movies that are released in two versions-one with the four letter words and one without. How I wish this had two versions.

I know some of you will mock me for my views but that's okay. To each his/her own.",1421366400,8,976,4.0625
6968325,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"This movie is more Powerful then any film in decades, it is Oscar worthy and it is much better then Saving Private Ryan and equally as good as Lone Survivor. This movie is very emotional that I was crying because are Soldiers go through so much. Bradley Cooper is phenomenal that you think it's Chris Kyle the LEGEND.",1421280000,11,317,4.482758620689655
6968326,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Blown away - figuratively speaking, at least!  We just watched this, and it was excellent.  I saw Chris Kyle's wife cry on the news after watching the trailer, and I have to say, that was probably the most moving and emotional thing I have seen associated with the movie.  A few details:

As some have pointed out, it did not necessarily follow the book.  They had to make a story out of it that everyone would sit and watch, and chose a couple specific scenarios to highlight and romanticize a bit.  But this is great storytelling, make no mistake, and Clint Eastwood continues to show why he is one of the most respected directors in the world.

There is also more emotional struggle here than in the book, and in my opinion, that makes the main character more relatable.  If the performance was quite as cold and had come to terms with his role as the real Chris Kyle, I am not sure we as an audience would have been able to relate.  That would be tough to watch.  He still has very clear direction and sense of purpose, don't get me wrong.  But the reality is truly far beyond what you can display successfully on screen.

Bradley Cooper absolutely changes my opinion of him as a lead male actor.  I loved things like Hangover, Wedding Crashers, and more serious roles like Limitless and Silver Linings Playbook.  But this puts him on a totally different level as an actor.

This is grand-scale, emotional story telling, and you will talk about this movie after.  You may relate to it politically, you may hold Kyle up as a hero, or perhaps vilify him.  But when you look at it from a storytelling aspect, regardless, it is excellent.  Just don't expect it to be a documentary.

Hint: This film is worth watching in a theater.  Not just for the larger than life battle scenes, but for the experience of an entire theater, nearly silent, at the end.",1421280000,641,1852,4.4880239520958085
6968327,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Jason Hall, American Sniper is based on the true story of American sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) who had 160 confirmed kills during four tours in Iraq. Cooper packed on 40+ pounds for the role and was obviously committed to bringing Kyle's story to life. His southern drawl at times can be quite annoying, but more candid than his 'Hangover' persona he's most known for. Thankfully I'm able to separate the two, which shows that Cooper is expanding his technique. Though he does a commendable job, the film itself boils down to a chick flick. We've all seen it before, guy meets girl, they get married, he goes off to war, she's pregnant with child and wishing he was home.

Sure there is some gore, headshots, and deaths, but the grittiness of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/0394758234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Platoon/dp/B005FUTC1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Platoon</a>&nbsp;isn't present. Women will swoon over Cooper and sob uncontrollably at the conclusion, but I couldn't invest myself emotionally into the story. I found that Kyle's beliefs of ""protecting his country"" during  the Iraqi war cliche. It was/still is a war to parade America's authority. It's a farcical point-of-view. All that aside, I'm sure your wives will love it. As mine said, ""This is the the best movie I've seen all year"", the same wife who enjoys such shows  as 'Teen Wolf', 'Teen Mom', and 'True Blood'. Take from that what you will.",1421193600,7,1637,5.8125
6968328,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"First, it needs to be said that Bradley Cooper does fully inhabit this role written for screen and I stopped thinking of him as being Bradley Cooper, which is a feat unto itself considering the pretty distinct roles he's had previously. The principals' performances were naturalistic, relaxed & comfortable when necessary (at times bordering on Benicio Del Toro or Brando understated... or maybe that was just the chew or cotton balls?), with a surprising ever-present verisimilitude, in my opinion.  The chemistry between Cooper and Miller had me hook, line, and sinker.

Suspending over-examination of the incongruity and non sequitur transition from 9/11 footage to ending up in Fallujah, which was about as blind an editing choice as when a prior administration State of the Union speech recognizing the family of a U.S. serviceman included the mention he was killed after being sent from Afghanistan to Iraq (hello?!), the battle scenes were well done here, even if some of the scenarios, dilemmas, and enemy antagonists were fabricated for a more useful narrative.  Impressive portrayal of marine and special warfare tactics.  I particularly liked watching their muzzle angles' coverage & management during entries and room clearing when in a group.

I don't quite buy some of the almost PTSD stuff considering other aspects of his personality that became known, but I loved the part in the car when he's upset about being in the states, people on their cell phones, and going to the mall.  Classic.  I just take most of the other at-home depiction as being a generalization that's supposed to be relatable to all vets.  They do an adept-enough job showing the ""on"" state that being in combat zones develops and ingrains over time and the difficulty turning that off, without resorting to some more overt techniques like him dropping to the ground every time a muffler backfires.  That's not exactly PTSD, but a conditioning effect of the environment they've just left.  Other subtle habitual indicators like watching peoples' hands and an occasional, almost-autistic-like, lack of eye contact during the evaluation of new surroundings might have been good ideas they could have shown more of.  I didn't notice any, but may have missed it.  Cooper's eyes have an intensity and something else going on that tells a lot as-is during these scenes.  I think the film kind of attempts to skew his personality by saying he was extremely repressing stress and flashbacks, when probably he was more as he was appearing to a lot of people: just eager to get back and annoyed by American complacency & obliviousness while war raged on.

The film also appears to take an understandable bit of cinematic license as to how humble he was about this ""legend"" status.  He wrote a best-selling book on it, went on the talk show circuit, started making up booze-induced or post-hang-over-haze stories about getting into fights with celebrity navy special warfare people, and wasn't quite as depicted here in the shying-away-from-fame thing.  That doesn't work if you, as the filmmaker, are going for a specific ""interpretation"" or theme, though, and might also cast his wounded warrior volunteerism in an unfair light.  I guess the same could be said for Eastwood's otherwise respectable and interesting depiction of Hoover, who in spite of his achievements was far more bizarre and paranoid than even the film J. Edgar showed.  Hint: in the film JFK, there's a photo of the late founder of the hijacked fake church being used as a rogue ops front up on the wall in David Ferrie's apartment during the scene where they're trying to find out how Ferrie died.  Hoover sat on the ""board of directors"" for this front and they were WAY, WAY weirder than Eastwood or Stone ever got into, though at least Stone threw in that little Easter egg.  Eastwood doesn't seem to touch the most controversial, real aspects of the personalities he explores even with a ten foot pole.  I wish there was a little more ballsy honesty and against-the-Hollywood-grain Robert Altman-esque rebel quality to Eastwood's style, but it is what it is and we're lucky to have him still making good films, regardless.

I was impressed with it as a combat film.  As a sort of everyman vet home drama exploration it works well if you don't take the at-home parts as exact history, either.  And, as much a result perhaps of this second part, it's certainly a flattering, well-intentioned memorial to the guy, even if it doesn't completely tackle him as an actual, imperfect human being like we all are.  RIP Chris Kyle, real American hero, blemishes and all.",1421107200,19,4611,4.97265625
6968329,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"What a phenomenal movie this is!  I did not read the book, but after watching this I definitely will!  I'm sure the book is far more detailed (and probably more historically accurate), however, this movie did NOT disappoint!  I'm a huge Bradley Cooper fan.  I'm glad that he got out of the ""Hangover"" roles without being type cast as a goofy actor.  Luckily this movie shows just HOW good an actor he really is!  This film also shows what a great director Clint Eastwood is!

The movie follows the story of Chris Kyle, ""America's most lethal Sniper in History"", and his journey from (even before) enlisting til his final day.  From the very beginning this movie sucks you in and it NEVER lets go!  What I found the most interesting (and this might have been common knowledge?!) is the fact he didn't join the military until he was 30?!  I definitely would have thought he'd have been an 18 year old enlist.  Either way, the movie is fantastic and does a terrific job of actually making you feel as if you were there.  Some of the decisions he had to make (whether historically accurate or not) in the movie makes your stomach knot wondering what it would be like to actually have to make that decision.

Final Verdict:  WATCH IT!  WATCH IT!  WATCH IT!  I can not recommend this movie enough!",1421107200,45,1291,4.51948051948052
6968330,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"This film is based on the true-life story of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), America's deadliest sniper. The movie portrays Chris as a super patriot from Texas, smart in his own way, but not too verbal. He had four tours in Iraq becoming a legend while distancing himself from his family with each tour. The film showed him suffering emotionally from his actions while displaying a tough exterior.

This is not exactly a war action film, but more of a war drama. It is a character study of someone that is hard to know. We got to see his boot-camp, early life, and bits of each of his four tours to complete the 130 minute bio. His demise is not shown but is included as an end note.

Worth viewing as a history and bio, although many negative aspects of his life were scrubbed. The controversy involving some of his claims is not included. No Jesse Ventura, no shooting Katrina looters, no killing high jackers which is what we would call ""sea stories.""

6968331,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"I'll start this review out by saying that I know people have strong feelings about Chris Kyle - some think that he was an infallible hero who gave his life for this country, and others say that he was a liar, a racist, and a serial killer. I don't care, and have no judgment about Chris Kyle - I didn't know him personally, and can only judge what I saw on screen. This is, after all, a movie review.

American Sniper tells the story of Chris Kyle, the 'Devil of Ramadi'. He was a Navy S.E.A.L. who has 160 confirmed kills with a documented 255 probable kills. He's the most lethal sniper in United States history in his four tours overseas.

The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, who has made an amazing looking film. Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, and is the highlight of the film. His portrayal of a tortured man at work and home is captured perfectly. Cooper looks amazing in the movie - clearly he bulked up for the role. Sienna Miller plays his wife.

Aside from the piles of insurgents, the main villain in the flick is an opposing sniper named Mustafa. Their cat & mouse game brought memories of Enemy at the Gates, and was thrilling. The war scenes looked realistic and brutal, but the scenes of Kyle back at home left something to be desired - specifically one scene that I'll touch on in a moment. The ending is also very clunky.

The scene. The scene that I'll forever remember from this movie. It's not a scene where someone gets a limb blown off, or a soldier making a kill at ridiculous range...no...it's not a scene with great emotion or acting gravitas...no...it's a scene of Bradley Cooper holding a baby. Specifically, a baby that's faker than those plastic TV's that litter the inside of model homes, or a ring that you might get from a quarter machine. Could Clint Eastwood not get an actual baby? The baby he's holding is so ridiculously fake that it took my wife and I right out of the movie. Normally she doesn't notice things like props, but she picked this one right out of the lineup.

Aside from the prop baby, the movie was pretty good. It had some pacing issues, and like I said, the ending is a bit clumsy, but it's a good movie. A good movie I'll probably never want to see again.",1420848000,14,2211,4.409313725490196
6968332,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"This movie is about Chris Kyle, the most prolific sniper in American history.  Directed by Clint Eastwood, it portrays Kyle as a heroic warrior of the US who sometimes struggles to kill his enemy, which is quite apparent when he must kill a child.  The movie claims to be based on his autobiography, but that is definitely not the case.  That is why I give it three stars.

Kyle's autobiography is clearly superior to the movie.  The Kyle in the book is riveting, complex, and interesting.  The movie portrays him as perfect in every which way.  It reeks of propaganda and, quite frankly, phoniness.

For instance, the movie portrays him as someone who, sometimes, struggles to kill.  In his book, he is very much at peace with what he's done.  He states in his book that he loved killing people and thought it was fun.  I hate the damn savages, he wrote. I couldn't give a flying f--- about the Iraqis.  That sounds more like a guy who is a good at killing people.  Guess what?  That is realism.  Unfortunately, that is not Hollywood, so we can't portray him that way.  In the film, he is a perfect gentleman and family man who is a very touchy feely sniper.

I guess that appeals to some people, but I would have liked to see the book Kyle onscreen.  I think people would understand.  In war, you need people like Kyle.  Are they heroes?  Maybe.  Are people like him necessary to win a war?  Absolutely.  Instead, Eastwood chooses to take the safe way out.  It's  the same old clear cut good vs bad guys movie.

Maybe, some day, someone will make a movie about the real Chris Kyle.  Unfortunately, this is not the one.",1420675200,56,1620,4.455479452054795

I don't think I could write anything that would do his sacrifice and that of many others that this movie shows. No its not 100% historically correct but ya know what if his window and his family approve then so do I. What you should take away from this is a sense of patriotism and a love for ones fellow countrymen. If you got a problem or don't like the nation then be respectful anyway. He would have done the same for you. It's not about how many men he killed or how many deployments he went on. It's about how he came home and lived his family. It's about his struggle to become what his family needed him to be and that is something you can learn from this movie no matter where you are from what you beleave or even if you agree with war or not. Get over yourselves and watch this movie with respect for it is due. Otherwise don't. It was an expertly crafted movie and Bradly Cooper paied great respect to Kyle in his part. Well done.

6968367,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I'm not going to critique this film the way the libs do.  I was upset with the movie mainly for its false pretense.  It basically is total fiction.  If you read the book (or were familiar with Kyle as a public personality after his retirement from the TEAMS) you know this movie manages to goof up almost everything, from Kyles passion and enjoyment of serving to the areas he actually struggled.  Not to mention the liberties taken with timelines, evil snipers, vendettas, etc.  This movie was using Kyle's name to push its own agenda.  Bradley cooper is great casting, the actors in general are solid, the cinematography I thought was great when the CGI was working.  But goodness, the stinking script is offensive in its fictionalization of his story.

He had a story, he had character and it seems for mostly worse they lost all of it.

I get that this movie was a celebration of a veteran, but if Kyle was brave enough to author his own vulnerabilities and imperfections in a book the least we could do was honor that in the script.  I get that Kyle was involved with the movie very hands on at a point before his death, so its hard to know what was his input and what wasn't, but I really didn't care for the product we got.

6968423,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"On the plus side, this was a /lot/ better than the other films I have seen about the wars in Afghanistan and/or Iraq.
Not to mention other semi-documentary films. Unlike, say, /Sully/, I cannot complain that the dangerous bits were underplayed.
But it does have a few problems:
-- it is one of those films where, if you don't already know the story going into the theater, you will have only the vaguest idea of it coming out
-- none of the characters is particularly memorable or interesting and so we just don't care what happens to them
-- it treats as perfectly sensible a wife calling her husband /in the middle of combat/ and getting upset when his total attention is not on her
This is not only self-centered, but stupid: it greatly reduces the husband's chance of survival.
And the same would apply if the genders were reversed.",1523664000,,836,4.58
6968424,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Pretty overhyped film. The most intriguing aspect of the story - how a notorious shooter met his demise at a gun range - is nearly left completely unexplored.

6968468,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Great movie. Tragic story. I think Clint Eastwood did really well at portraying a realistic image of Chris Kyle, as opposed to strictly idealizing him and focusing on the 'most kills in American military history...'. As with most everybody, we possess the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I believe its well known that Kyle was no exception. Knowing that, throughout the movie there are several scenes specifically targeting those character forming events, showing the viewer who Chris Kyle was (or at least said to be). In my opinion, he was a honorable man who stepped up and defended us and our country when we were attacked. In 2001 nobody knew his name or the names of the countless American who dropped what they were doing and signed up to go to war.  I was in the 2nd grade on 9/11, so I will always see our ""Chris Kyle's"" as hero's and we owe all our veterans a severe debt of gratitude.",1518912000,,896,4.4969325153374236

With over 12,000 review's at the time of this writing, I doubt anybody will ever read this so I'm not making a real review.
I'm just ranting for a few minutes to make me feel better about wasting my time with this movie. It's not as if I haven't learned my lesson about Hollywood these days......""fool me twice (or a hundred times), shame on me""

What a disappointment! This why I only watch old movies and independent movies these days. I thought for once I would get a good war movie without all the politically correct nonsense.
What I got was a movie that if I tell it like it is, I'll be called a misogynist.

It started off well enough but then goes down hill from there. I got so sick of listening to the wife cry that I started fast forwarding though any scene which took place while Kyle was home. Really if you just edit out all the scenes from home and eliminate the phone calls to his wife which seem to take place only during battle scenes (it's a wonder he didn't get killed from stupidity on the battle field).

""WAAAHHH......you need to be home with your family....WAAAAAHHHH.....your son needs his father.....WAAAAHHHH....I thought you were dead.....WAAAAHHHH.....
No wonder he wanted to go back to war......I'll bet he couldn't wait to get back so he didn't have to listen to his wife's crying....

I mean really how annoying was his wife.....if there was an Academy Award for Most Annoying Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role....they would need only one nomination....unanimous vote for.......""American Sniper (No, I'm not even going to bother looking up her name)""......",1516924800,,1714,4.662251655629139

6968495,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Everything in the movie is top shelf. The writing, directing, acting, editing, photography, etc. The politics of the entire enterprise is something to which I won't even remotely consider giving a second thought, and as such, what I have to say is strictly in regard to the final on-screen product.

Bradley Cooper received a lot of positive press for his role, and I can sum up his performance in one word: astonishing. He becomes Chris Kyle. His movements, expressions, drawl, and sheer mass make it nearly impossible for the viewer to accept that this is the guy from the Hangover movies. I thought he was excellent in Silver Linings Playbook, but in American Sniper he took his acting to a whole new level. Even though he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor, his performance was one that should be long remembered. It was that good.

My wife and I caught American Sniper while it was in the theaters. Similar to what other reviewers have stated, the audience sat still, not uttering even a word as the final credits finished rolling during our showing. In addition, they filed out of the theater in complete silence. There was no conversation, even in the lobby. The effect was stunning. As an active moviegoer, it was a moment that Ill never forget.",1516752000,,1254,4.7214611872146115

6968523,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"At the ripe age of 84, director Clint Eastwood made one of the best films of all time. Following the trend that began with Zero Dark Thirty (2012) and continued with Lone Survivor (2013), the modern day breed of war movies that are biographies and depictions of the real events. The genre has maintained a presence since the late 2000s with fictional recreations and documentaries, which have helped stage the battle field or discussed politics, yet after the killing of Usama bin Laden  Hollywood began delivering the appalling true stories to popular reception and controversy. American Sniper repackages the war in Iraq from the standpoint of the United States solider, specifically the Navy Seal. A boys growth into manhood, who nurtures a relationship, ultimately into a family while agonizing with the shifting between a peaceful family life and horrific war. The screenplay abridges scenes from Chris Kyles book and (in 132 minutes) highlights the sadistic nature of war and being on the front lines in Iraq. Yet the movie goes beyond the source material to paint the entirety of the Kyles plight from mental destruction to reform. Eastwood had addressed this previously with World War II veterans in Flags of our Fathers (2006), depicting solemn heroes brutally scarred by battle. Kyles story however has gripped the country because of the blurriness between good and evil with which Americans view the Iraqi war with, an aspect emphasized in ""American Sniper"" along with many others. The extraordinary box office reception and critical acclaim has rightfully made Eastwood's masterpiece the cinematic corner stone recreation of the Iraqi war.",1514419200,,1651,5.230188679245283

6968553,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"The continuity for parts of this movie was confusing because it jumped around as if trying to squeeze everything into a shorter time frame.  I didn't like the beginning because it was out of sequence, but I understand that was to draw the audience in.  I almost fast forwarded through the hunting flashback and only didn't because I thought there might be a critical element that I would need to know later.  That entire hunting flashback scene at the beginning could have been shortened or eliminated because I didn't see that it added anything to the story that was necessary.

I've always liked Clint Eastwood's acting, directing and producing and he has put out a lot of great movies.  Not to say this one isn't great.  I think the problem is with the editing or some scenes might have been cut out.  Bradley Cooper and supporting cast were all great and the video quality was excellent.  I had hoped there would be more battle scenes because of the movie title, but the main plot seemed to be more on Chris Kyle's life more so than being a sniper.",1511827200,,1052,4.558510638297872

6968585,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"I suppose I should not be surprised here. The good folks on the Interwebs are pretty divided over Clint Eastwoods latest effort at war drama, American Sniper. This film offers the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, Americas most lethal crack shot, who saw several tours in the Middle East, and was killed stateside in 2013 by a disturbed Army veteran he was trying to help.

Discourse, if one can call it that, concerning this film has distilled to a troubling reflection of the political polarization in this country. Those who lean right claim that the film honors the greatest American hero since Audie Murphy  a true flag-raising inspiration. Those who lean left say the film celebrates a racist war-mongering sociopath.

Internet pundits have reduced American Sniper to a political football, and yet none have stopped to consider that this is kind of a crappy film  no matter what your political affiliations.

Kyle, as portrayed in American Sniper, is nearly emotionless and almost entirely one-dimensional. Eastwood misses a golden opportunity to unpack the psychological and emotional roller coaster that combat veterans surely experience, both in the field and back home. Eastwood attempts an artistic evaluation of the human experience in war and gives us a flat monotone. Based on the film alone  do we empathize with, reject, celebrate, or feel remorse for Kyle? Not really. All (or nearly all) of the emotion stirred by American Sniper is incidental to the films story itself, not to mention its main character  the hullabaloo is a post screening layer of punditry applied only because many feel the need to take sides on a divisive topic and a war fraught with controversy.

There are plenty of films that offer nuanced and beautifully staged depictions of humanity faced with the grim realities of combat: The Thin Red Line, Full Metal Jacket, and The Hurt Locker come immediately to mind  and there are many others. But American Sniper, politics aside, falls disappointingly short.",1507680000,,1993,5.0703363914373085

If you are considering which version to buy I would say if all you want is the movie that is the cheaper option, if you want to deep dive into the man and the Seal culture... this will be your ticket!!",1506124800,4,679,4.322834645669292

6968659,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"So, its best to look at this movie as historical fiction: the final battle sequence in Iraq never happened, and there's stuff that Kyle claimed that's kind of hard to believe: such as shooting looters in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, and killing assailants trying to car jack him, in the US... and then there's his claims against Jesse Ventura, in which the courts sided with Ventura... for a recent interview about this mess, check out  joe rogan experience #858.

Whatever the guy was, there's a lot of heroes in our military; and in particular, in the Special Forces and we -- as a country -- should pay them more than just lip service, we should allow them to qualify for FULL MILITARY HEALTH CARE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE AFTER 4 YEARS OF SERVICE, not the 20 that's the minimum.",1501977600,,791,4.563380281690141
6968660,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood's adaptation of sniper Chris Kyle's story is the type of movie you watch and wonder where the time had gone. At no point is there a wasted scene in this film, as each adds to the complexity of what it means to go through such horrible experiences that Kyle did. The positive reviews here are spot-on, so I won't add too much to what they said except for those who thought the ending was too abrupt, and this is where Eastwood's film making style jives with mine. He ended the film abruptly to mirror how Kyle's life ended: out of nowhere. It adds to the sense of tragedy. So know that this is a stylistic choice Eastwood made and not poor film making (quite the opposite, actually).

EDIT: I was going to buy this from Best Buy because their steelbook version has case artwork I like a lot more, and noticed that their case indicates there's a digital copy included (I like to have both disc and digital for backup purposes, and portability while I travel), but their price is significantly higher than Amazon's. The cover artwork sold here at Amazon does NOT indicate a digital copy, and I could NOT find indication of a digital copy within the product description (sometimes they're included even when the product description doesn't say anything about it), so I forestalled buying this for a while (almost a year, actually). Needless to say, Amazon's price dropped recently to a point that I felt compelled to buy the Blu-ray even if it didn't have a digital copy included, and to my surprise, when I opened the case, the slipcard for redeeming my digital copy was included. So keep that in mind if you like buying Blu-rays that contain digital copies - your results may vary, but surprisingly mine included one and I'm happy about that.",1501804800,,1755,4.625

6968690,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"It was a long time before I got around to watching this movie. Remember, the film kicked up a lot of controversy and was characterized by some as Islamophobic. I found it neither controversial, nor Islamophobic. I found it a slow and tedious movie about an ugly war in a part of the world where misery is the soup du jour and women, children and the aged die gruesome deaths for no reason at all. The single most memorable scene shows a child wearing a suicide vest and this child is shot dead by the Protagonist of the story. Yes, it's an awful thought and it does happen.

Unfortunately, the movie's plot really does not hang together well (my opinion) and the story is just plain thin. Sure, this is non-fiction that was fictionalized for the movie-going public, designed to present the story of a truly committed soldier doing an unpleasant task virtually none of us could do. It ends not with some logical conclusion; it just runs out of gas and grinds to a halt.

My opinion only--this movie is one you can miss without missing anything at all.",1499558400,,1050,4.521052631578947

6968732,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Strong performance from Bradley Cooper in the story of an American hero. Although I have never been in the armed services, movies like these really help to remind you how much the men and women who serve our country sacrifice to help keep us safe. The story of Chris Kyle is powerful in its depiction of a man who was responsible for saving the lives of countless soldiers in war, and for helping those same people once they returned home. This movie is a stark depiction of the toll that war can take on a person when they come home, and how difficult it can be to adjust to a ""normal"" life. I would recommend watching this movie not just for the exceptional film making, acting, dialog, and story, but also so that, in some small way, we can honor those about whom this film serves as a remembrance.",1495670400,7,801,4.382550335570469

6968744,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle grows up as the All-American Boy. Living in texas, growing up hunting, being a ranch hand and bronco riding. In 1999, Kyle enlists to the US Navy and goes through BUD\S training and joins the Navy SEALs. After completing training in 2001, and just after 9-11, Kyle is deployed to Iraq and starts work with army and marine units. Kyle serves from 1999 to 2009, receives 2 silver stars, five bronze stars with valor, two navy and marine corps achievement medals and two navy and marine corps commendations. During his 4 deployments, he lost his point man Marc Lee in 2006 and Ryan Job in 2009. After his service, he created his own company to train law enforcement and military operators to help them improve their skill. Kyle and his family moved to Texas in 2012 and he started doing charity work with wounded warriors. In 2013, Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield were killed, helping a veteran in the program. He is buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.  This is such a patriotic story. It is about love, service, dedication, and sacrifice, whether with time, thoughts or your life. Chris Kyle is the true definition of an American Soldier, and a Patriot. His dedication towards his craft just shows his efforts to help improve the world and our people. Chris Kyles biography is as amazing as it is shocking and thrilling. This book does include several violent scenes of death and destruction, as well as explicit cursing scenes and sexual scenes. Overall though, it is a great book with a great rating. Great stories about friendship, enduring the hard times, going along with the crazy times, and learning from all the mistakes and difficult times in life. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes autobiographies, biographies, military books, true stories or any good stories about heroism.",1494460800,,1823,4.824281150159744

I was not disappointed.  It was obviously ""Hollywood-ized"" for the movie audience, but I found much of it very believable.  It did a very good job of juxtaposing the Kyles' home life and the chaos on the battlefield Bradly Cooper did an amazing portrayal of Chris Kyle, as did Sienna miller as Taya Kyle. Having retired seal Kevin Lacz as a technical adviser certainly was a plus.  I down-rated it one star because of the aforementioned ""Hollwood-ization.""",1494028800,3,683,4.666666666666667

6968773,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"As portrayed, Chris Kyle is perfectly understandable as, I assume, the sniper with by far the greatest number of certified kills in the conflict.  His father fostered the notion that he had a role as a protector; and that armed conflict was the logical means.  Perhaps his brother struggled with being in the shadow of his alpha masculinity.  On the evidence of his rodeo work, he apparently exulted in his physicality. The Towers happened at the right moment for him to move to the reality of war.  The film makes clear how different his attitude to his situation was from some other soldiers.  They might be thought of as citizen soldiers who knew they were in hell to fulfill an obligation and hoped they would outlive it.  He ran it out to four tours. The fact that he was accused of never opening that Bible of his hints at the fact that he was comfortable accepting the validating premises of armed conflict.  Eastwood doesn't much go into what happened regarding his death by another vet.  The film makes clear that many who were lucky enough to come back from their tours were badly damaged in many ways.  I'm not sure their contrasts with The Legend were going to be therapeutic, sucking it up just can't be the answer for everybody. Like his subject here, on the evidence of his body of work, Eastwood is an action man.  Nuance apparently tries his patience.  And he is a big success.",1492473600,,1394,4.580645161290323

6968797,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"This is a tough movie, but worthy of viewing. The redemptive parts of the movie for me, aside from all the necessary sniping to protect the Marines in Iraq, are 1) how he began to come back emotionally to his wife and children after his years of 4 tours of duty, 2) his admission to the psychiatrist that his major emotional problem was grief over the Marines whose lives he could not save (for which he felt guilty, reminding us of Schindler's List), and 3) his devotion to wounded soldiers at his home area after active service.  It takes a dead person to not weep when the motorcade for his funeral on a rainy day wheels down the Interstate and into Texas Stadium, which Jerry Jones had made available to the thousands who attended his funeral. Texas withheld no honor from this exceptional Seal.

Such movies like that need to be made. To some such heroes seem simplistic and over glamorized by the movie, but the story is none the less valid and its messages none the less valid to many Americans.  I have had family die in the Marines service in both WW II and Viet Nam. I myself have never served in the military. I am retired clergy. However, my brother and my uncle gave everything up for service to this country. Maybe I have an inside track on appreciating sacrifice for this country..",1490572800,32,1296,4.483050847457627

Dialogue felt unrealistic,plastic and, well...melodramatic.  Good example, he calls her from a truck traveling through a war zone in Iraq. they come under fire. So we cut back and forth between the battle scene and her back home screaming into the phone, ""Chrissss!"" Oh, forgot to say, she had just told him their baby would be a boy. Bleck.

The battle scenes are the only worthwhile part and again, not in a league with the classics, B material at best. I didn't watch the last twenty minutes, just skimmed it. He goes back home, is emotionally scarred, blah blah blah. Very poor acting, predictable. I downloaded it for $6 and feel conned. This is a straight to DVD flick that should have been free on prime.

Cooper does a good job of slipping in to the PTSD zone. He worries about his wife and kids while shooting kids in Iraq.

6968969,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Hate to say so but this is a below average film.

I'm a fan of this type of film and CPO Kyle is an American hero but it is not captured in the film.

The family life scenes are too numerous and too slow. Seal training scenes seem over edited and don't give the impression of what it would be like.

It's the perfect movie if want half chick flick/half action.... but I'm not into chick flick.. so there....

I couldn't finish it....",1484352000,,433,4.180722891566265

6969156,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I never saw the movie and lost any desire to see it.

This is the story of a man whose job it was to expertly murder whomever the United States government declared to him to be ""the enemy."" Despite the fact that we all know that our government lies our way into war after war, we remain the narcotized citizenry that is expected to worship ""war heroes"" and fierce patriotism.

Perhaps to be a ""war hero"" requires less heroism than psychopathy - there, I said it - but most Americans have lost all ability to self-reflect that deeply.

Many of these ""war heroes"" come home to jobs as police officers. Huh. Expert killers roaming our streets as cops who see everyone, first, as an enemy combatant.

We're supposed to worship cops, too...

This is a sad story to be sure, but we have made for ourselves some very strange gods to worship. In this case, we are expected to bow with drunken patriotism at the feet of a...professional American sniper.

One of life's ""necessary evils"" perhaps, but hardly good and hardly god.

""I was just following orders"" is for robots, not heroes. And government - even American! -propaganda and indoctrination will never change that fact.

The ultimate cold-blooded murder of this man and his friend was hideous. But that does not erase the question about whether or not a professional U.S. government sniper is a man upon whose shoulders you want your kids one day to stand.",1479859200,,1405,4.659919028340081

Armored vehicles with soldiers move through a town. Doors are opened, soldiers enter. A sniper inspects people. There is a flashback to an earlier time when a young boy with a rifle drops his deer. Then he is in church for a sermon. His father tells him there are three types of people: sheep, wolves, and sheep dogs. There is a fight at school. [Where are the teachers?] A man rides a bucking horse until he is thrown off. Then he arrives home early and gets a surprise! The TV tells of a bombing attack at a US Embassy. He joins the Navy SEALs and undergoes rigorous training. [Is this a recruiting film?] A lone woman in a bar attracts men, they talk. Drinking shots to throw up? Soldiers practice with bolt-action rifles at a target range. The news on TV shows the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. Chris Kyle marries in an outdoor ceremony.

The job of a sniper is to protect the Marines as they go door to door. Any military age male civilian is a presumed enemy. They spot a woman with a young boy, she has a hidden object. Two shots do it. Later a car with a male driver speeds towards the Marines but he is stopped. There are other targets as well. The enemy leaders are identified, the highest priority to date. The Marines invade a home to find a man and a boy, they did not leave. They question him, he offers a deal. The Marines drive down a street, an enemy sniper fires at them. Chris wife hears the action on the cell phone! The operation is called off. Chris returns home on leave. Chris has high blood pressure, 170/110. Too much coffee. Back in Iraq he meets his brother. A direct action squad will hunt the Butcher. They occupy a house to watch a restaurant. Chris discovers a weapons cache! The ambush succeeds, a firefight results. [The dark scenes make it hard to see what happened.] A crowd of people gathers to protest.

Back home a man thanks Chris Kyle for saving his life (he lost a leg). Chris now has a daughter. Then he is back in Iraq. A civilian calls when the Marines drive by. There are shots. A sniper shoots a Marine, he is rushed to the hospital. They return to combat. They enter a house, there is an ambush. Back in the states there is a funeral. Chris blames it on a letter from home. Chris visits his wounded brother. His wife wants him to quit, she wants him human again. Then he is back in Iraq. He sees a man with an RPG and stops him. A young boy walks close.

They need to shut down an enemy sniper. The squad ascends to a roof top to search for the enemy sniper. They see someone a mile away, Chris gets him! Then the enemy attacks. They call for help. Chris calls his wife, hes ready to come home. A helicopter arrives to attack the enemy and rescue the Marines. Chris returns home, but he is restless. Chris visits veterans at a VA hospital. Then he returns to his home in Texas. Chris meets a man and they go for a drive. Chris was trying to help this veteran, but something went very wrong. They show a motorcade of cars and motorcycles. There is a Memorial Ceremony at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington Texas.

The second DVD has Special Features: The Journey of American Sniper and The Making of American Sniper. This film is based on actual historical events, the dialogue and some events and characters were created for dramatization. It was directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. It seems like a documentary at times, but ignores the political reasons for Operation Iraqi Liberation. Was it necessary? Did Chris make a fatal mistake in following the advice of a psychiatrist to work with other veterans? They used Rabat Morocco for the Iraqi city, as it has the same type of architecture. [It is not mentioned but Jesse Ventura won a civil law suit against Chris Kyle before the latters death. Was this significant?]",1477872000,,3825,4.412181303116148

6969213,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"I've expected more from this movie!!! When i read the biographg of Chris Kyle, i've started thinking: "" what a important piece of history is this man!""
Out of 300+ kills that this sniper performed, director of this movie could have chosen better combat scenes... in my personal opinion, it is not showing the war, as dramatic and scary as it is!!! Casting was on the high school acting level!!! They should of gone through more and more consulting!!!",1477872000,,450,4.708860759493671

One minute he was at home and the next instant he was elsewhere.  It was not clear exactly what time period the movie covered (a month, a year, several years, etc.).  Fortunately I knew something of the background or I would not have understood what was happening.  Granted when guns were being fired it was obvious there was a war going on.  When he was with his wife it was obvious he was at home.  All in all it was a difficult story line to follow.",1477612800,,592,4.185840707964601

Strange, but I like quality military sniper movies, e.g., ""Platoon"" ""Hurt Locker"" ~ this was best, imo.  When finally I got to the end of it, I noticed I was hyperventilating and had to walk around a bit, it is so real and second disc with explanations by Eastwood team and actors is very interesting.  Thought at first I would not be seeing this one a second time, too authentic for ""grandma"" but did watch it a second time after a few days.  And, I was prayerfully grateful my son was just at the wrong age for military between wars.  Any wonder so much post-traumatic syndrome.  Abundant gratitude to the military persons who are over there serving, fighting this horrific and heart breaking war which hero of this film justifies the why these people are willing.",1471737600,,868,4.633986928104576

6969454,2,B00SB9Y6KW,as a long time fan of Eastwood I expected more.  At best I would rate a 2.5 of 5. I felt the acting to be at best mediocre and the plot rather vague. Was it his service and skill or was it his PTSD. When a human kills another it does do things to the mind unless you are a sociopath.

Perhaps a bloody scene every 3 minutes would have been something I would have insisted on as a director, instead they decided to go with Bambi stuff...I got a headache and paused, watched the rest later.

Just bein' honest like most red blooded men, I like the guts and killings in movies especially when it's pretendbelieve like the movies are.

6969607,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Snipers are a necessary part of any fighting force, and this film clarifies their role more than any other example I can think of. We see the sniper's training, how he fits in to the overall combat unit, and get a feeling for the tense, split-second decisions that these soldiers live with. We also see some of the difficulty in re-integrating into society once the fighting is over, although Kyle's difficulties are more talked about than actually seen on screen. At one point, someone mentions Kyle's 160-plus confirmed kills as an American record, and I thought of the Finnish sniper Simo Hyh, who racked up over 700 kills in the 1939 Winter War with Russia. Hyh worked under far worse conditions, in sub-zero temperatures, holding snow in his mouth so his breath wouldn't give away his position, and using a rifle with iron sights to avoid reflections and allow him to keep his head lower and present less of a target. Maybe someone will make a film about him someday.

""American Sniper"" is well done, if somewhat choppy, as befits Eastwood at this stage of his career, where for a long time he has proved himself a master of the action story. What's missing is the moral ambiguity of his masterpiece Unforgiven, which essentially changed the Western from a good guys vs. bad guys genre to one that presented that period as populated with complex and nuanced characters. ""American Sniper"" as a war film doesn't go anywhere near that territory; the Americans are unequivocally the good guys, while the ""enemy"" are little more than distant and dangerous targets to be picked off one by one. This approach may have worked for any other war but the Iraq invasion, possibly the worst mistake the U.S. made in recent memory - a war with no justification whatsoever, a horrific fraud perpetrated on the American people, who showed their disapproval with the largest anti-war demonstrations in history that took place before a war actually started. Eastwood wholeheartedly perpetrates this fraud, by showing the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 as Kyle's motivation to join the military, then showing him in Iraq, as if the two events were connected. We see no politicians, no George W. Bush or Saddam Hussein (although Osama bin Laden is mentioned at one point) - the Towers falling is linked to Iraq as Pearl Harbor is to Japan.

If Eastwood believes this, he's bought into a lunatic fringe conspiracy theory, and if he doesn't believe it, then he's shamelessly pandering to this same conspiracy. If he'd chosen to show the moral vacuum of this war through the effect it had on its participants, ""American Sniper"" may have been among his finest films. Instead, Eastwood whitewashes this debacle by falsely portraying Kyle as if he were Simo Hyh defending his own homeland against the invaders. In his dotage, Eastwood has become little more than a shill for the neocon branch of the Republican Party. His next film, which will either be about Richard Jewell, the security guard who discovered a bomb at the 1996 Olympics, or airline pilot ""Sully"" Sullenberger and his saving of United Airlines flight 1549, might give Eastwood a chance to redeem himself with stories that won't require the same degree of maturity.",1469664000,2,3211,4.868372943327239

There is something about it that just draws me to it, despite some silly scenes such as Kyle calling his wife on his phone in the middle of a battle. Bradley Cooper is just so appealing in this film - much more manly than his usual pretty boy image. The wife is annoying though. She knew he was a seal before they married so I don't know why she keeps whining for him to quit all the time. She should have married a non-military person.",1465430400,,477,4.195652173913044

I bought this movie back in Oct. and have only now had the opportunity to watch it. How was the movie?

Beats me...the disc stopped playing at the 1:27:15 mark. Shoulda checked it sooner. Except I was in South America for four months.

That said, what I did see of the movie was pretty good. Well acted and shot cleanly (no shaky-cam, so the action was easy to follow) it has good production values. There is a lot to the story so likely only the highlights were dealt with, but it appears to have brought a solid story to the screen.

So...truth in advertising: the first part of the movie gets four stars. The DVD manufacturer gets no stars. Looks like I'l have to wait until it comes to the $3 bargain bin to find out how things turn out.",1464480000,,784,4.3493150684931505

6970175,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"This seems to be a very divisive movie -- you either love it or you hate it.  And neither side seems to be able to let the other side have their opinion and let it be.  If you like this movie, you'll be accused of glorifying a pointless war and/or being anti-Muslim.  If you don't like this movie, you'll be seen as unsupportive of our troops and unsympathetic toward those that come home physically or psychologically maimed.  There's little in-between.  I suppose that's not entirely a bad thing -- this movie raises issues that deserve discussion, and controversy and discussion also guarantee more publicity for the film in the end.

I must confess that I didn't enjoy ""American Sniper,"" and the fact that it deviates notably from the source material (the true story and the biography of the same name) bothers me.  But I can't condemn it either, as it invites discussion regarding the wars in the Middle East and our involvement in them, as well as the scourge of PTSD and how it affects our soldiers.

It's hard to fault the actors in this film, as by and large they do a fantastic job.  The only other film I've seen Bradley Cooper in is ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" and this film is radically different from that one.  But Cooper brings life and humanity to Chris Kyle, who from all accounts was something of a sociopath in real life.  He may not have played Chris Kyle true to life, but he DID play a soldier -- one who is willing to do his duty and fight for his country, but who also recognizes the toll it's taking on himself and his family, and who must struggle with the fact that some part of him will never truly come home from the front lines.

The film introduces quite a few elements that weren't present in the actual story, such as the rival sniper that Kyle tries desperately to hunt down during his tours of duty.  While I understand why the film added these elements (for one thing, the filmmakers probably felt that the audience wouldn't want to watch a film that didn't have a single obvious villain), I don't have to like it either.  A film trying to tell a true story has an obligation to tell the truth, and while I understand these films are only ""based on a true story,"" I feel they do the original story a disservice when they add elements simply to make a film more marketable.

By far, however, the film works best when it explores PTSD.  Kyle may have come home, but some part of his mind remains immersed in the fighting, and something as simple as a drill in an automotive shop or a dog knocking down a child at a neighborhood picnic bring back terrible memories... and fighting instincts.  And though Kyle's quest to aid others and himself with his demons ultimately ended up costing him his life (a fact the film thankfully doesn't show in graphic detail), I'm glad the film didn't gloss over this, as too often war movies tend to end when the soldier comes home, without showing the tragic effects.

This is one of those movies that, while powerful, bothered me enough while watching that I probably won't watch it again.  I wish they hadn't taken so many liberties with Kyle's story, and there are parts that are extremely unpleasant to watch.  Still, it definitely left an impression on me, and it's a film I won't forget anytime soon.",1462924800,,3275,4.509306260575296

6970195,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"This review is for American Sniper the chrirs kyle commemorative DVD edition. This is a two disc dvd with all the extras mentioned in the  above item editorial review with all the new extra bonus features mentioned on the item's bonus features. The dvd verion is a 2(blue+red)disc. The first disc which is blue (i think) contains the feature film and a new bonus on the commemorative documentary on chris kyle and the lives of his fellow frog-men/S.E.A.Ls and the toll the wars or duty tours takes on them. The second disc which is red (i think) has all the new bunch of extras listed on the amazon website for this product. The documentary part ""the making of american sniper""... opens with teaser trailer that debuted on youtube and t.v., the part where he is laying on a hidden balcony rooftop with a fellow soldier monitoring a woman and boy approaching their military convoy...from there on it merges into a full on descriptive documentary narrated by director clint eastwood and actor bradley cooper  about what they went through, into going about achieving the making of the movie. The theatical trailer is the more dramatic and action packed trailer which with him calling his wife and telling her he was ready to come home in the mist of the approaching sandstorm and apache helicopter shooting up a part of a bulding to provide the U.S. soldiers cover from their enemies. This is the trailer i liked the most because it was very emotive and intense, happy to finally have it on hard copy dvd. In all a complete and total movie collection package of THE AMERICAN SNIPER movie. I couldn't be happier with the purchase, this goes into my special collection of top notch realistic war movies. Hopefully amazon will have the dvd version of this  commemorative edition really soon. Note the front and back image on the blu ray commerotative edition is the same on the dvd version. Thus to conclude this is a must buy for all those who enjoyed the movie despite some accuracy and factual flaws. A good masterpiece collection.",1462752000,,2028,4.739376770538244

6970251,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Feel good movie. Though I enjoyed watching and felt admiration for the main character, the message of the film is full of contradictions, crazy-making.

Texas is notorious for it's macho culture and Clint Eastwood as director/producer would feel he had to uphold the American cowboy culture many of us were fed on growing up.  He does a pretty good job of doing that with the Chris Kyle character:  determined, self-sacrificing, focused, strong, resourceful and gregarious, even humble, and most of all committed to excellence at what he does -- kill.  In spite of his numerous successful kills, he remains carefully discerning of who he kills and the risks.

He is not crazy.  Unless he returns to ""normal"" life.  Then we are left on edge and wondering what he might do next. He also has problems understanding both how to relate to his wife and how to handle his celebrity as a killer.

Then he's introduced to the idea of helping other vets....to shoot!?  Eastwood doesn't seem to know what he wants to say about this.  Surely shooting isn't the only thing someone like Kyle is good at.  What he needs to do is to apply his inner character and numerous strengths to another chosen work or field of interest and help other vets to do the same thing.  Instead...shooting and more shooting.  Eastwood may be making a statement with this,-- or not.  This is why I can only give Clint Eastwood no more than 3 stars. What is he saying?  It is a cop-out to just try to please everyone, as in, you can see what you wanna see.

The final scenes even are forced -- forced to be ambiguous.  They include what appears to be real footage of fans. Reality speaks for itself: Kyle and a friend end up shot by another recovering vet out on the shooting range. Life cames full circle, however tragically: live by the gun, die by the gun.

Yet Eastwood creates confusion in this message.  He has Taya, Kyle's wife, delight in how normal, healthy, and fun Kyle is acting right before he's shot.  What is healthy and norma?: swinging a gun around recklessly in your own home. The strangest most absurd scene is not in Iraq, however fatalistic and bizarre normal life is there.  A love scene with drawn gun and sexual gun play around children, ending with the gun held lovingly against Taya's rear.

Now some will see this as a condemnation of macho gun culture, but others will see this as normal fun or even glorious.  So the movie does not take a stance and fails to be much more than patriotic entertainment and confirmation of one's own biases.  Mindless.",1462060800,,2542,4.610244988864142

6970283,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"I felt like it was a good movie overall, but it was missing something. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen, and it never did. I do however, think it accurately portrays what war does to those who actually fight in them. Killing is tough business... and it's either your guys or theirs. I pick theirs to die, not mine, and I think that's what most of these guys do too. Full Disclosure: I'm no soldier, I've known a few from my college days, but I wouldn't say that I can speak for them at all. They might have opinions very different from mine. I defer to their experience, but as a civilian I felt like I benefited as a human being as well as being entertained by this movie.

6970507,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood may be a polarizing figure in light of his politics, but he deftly handles this subject by letting the thoughts and philosophy of Chris Kyle take the reins (pun intended). What results is, much like the Hurt Locker and Lone Survivor, an apolitical film. A film that doesn't ""tell both sides of the story,"" but rather just tells the truth, as it is known by any given character at any point. Cooper is brilliant throughout, and the respect shown to the fallen Chris Kyle is fitting and just. Eastwood's calm steady hand as director makes this a deeply emotional cinematic experience, all politics aside.",1457740800,,617,4.830188679245283

I read the book before I watch the movie and there are core differences of course. I won't spoil the details but if you want a good movie with a good balance of action and personal struggle this one is for you. If you want the whole story, take the time to read the book as well.

The copy I purchased was the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD. I like doing this because I can add the movie to my amazon account and watch it that way as well without having to put a disc on the player or watch it when I'm away from home.",1457481600,,730,3.8926174496644297

6970577,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle's life and his career as a Navy SEAL make for great cinema. It's unfortunate that Eastwood and the writers didn't think so, and tried to ""improve"" on the reality. This film shows little regard for Kyle's personality and values, and some moments are downright corny.  ""American Sniper"" has little to do with Chris Kyle's written memoir OR his life. Eastwood does just about everything but put Bradley Cooper in red, white and blue makeup.

Kyle did his duty with a clear conscience. About the only time the movie depicts this accurately is when he tells the VA psychiatrist that he ""will stand before his creator and answer for every shot I took."" The rest of the movie shows him cringing at some of the kills he has to make and agonizing over whether he can continue combat duty. This is such an obvious surrender to Hollywood's ""guns are bad and OMG I had to shoot a woman (never mind that this is war and she's the enemy)"" mentality that I could hear the eyeballs rolling in the theater. Kyle was proud of doing his duty (and rightly so). This attempt to be PC disgusted me and did a great disservice to Kyle.

Kyle states that he had planned to enlist in the military when still a child. The filmmakers didn't find that a valid excuse, and wrote in a scene where he views a terror attack and decides he's needed to defend his country. Chris Kyle had more than enough nobility of character, and this attempt to ""improve on the original"" comes off as staged and corny as the hokey dialogue.  If that isn't enough, his record as a sniper is padded with a lame plot device about Chris Kyle, Navy SEAL vs Olympic Gold Medal Enemy Sniper Champion. Are America's fighting men and women really so boring that a pure and truthful script won't make a decent movie?

""American Sniper, the Movie"" could have been so much better than it is. It does an injustice to Chris Kyle's memory and I can't give it more than two stars.",1456790400,2,1926,4.475783475783476

6970583,3,B00SB9Y6KW,The reason for only 3 stars is that Bradley Cooper gained so much weight for the role that his face was so puffy to be almost unrecognizable. He worked very hard to get Kris Kyle's Texas accent which also helped wipe away the Bradley Cooper persona which was all probably intentional. To me it was too much at trying to look and sound like (mimic) the real life Kris Kyle. It was a depressing story shot in almost a documentary style with very little music scoring.

6970702,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Certainly a polarizing movie I believe Clint Eastwood masterfully brought the story of Kyle to the big screen.  For those who either think Eastwood colored the story too much or have pacifist leanings I imagine it best if you quite reading now.  If you feel within military objectives this man had the right stuff then, by all means you should see this film.

The business of defending a country is always going to invite differences of opinion.  For those who fully support the right to do so men such as Kyle are exactly the kind of person you want on your side.  This is the story of a person who took his mission to the limits and, unfortunately, it becomes an integral part of the man to which he finds it difficult to separate from his life outside the military.  No matter if it is colored it seems wholly possible as depicting a large truth in exceptional circumstances.  A man who seems built for the kill, if necessary, becomes a bit of a machine to which he loses a part of himself to ""the mission"".  Life outside the mission becomes a lot more difficult and in the transition back to a normal life some extraordinary circumstances come to pass.  It's a sobering look at just a slice of the PST life of an over-achiever with a natural talent for a narrow wheelhouse of service within the military.  It underscores how much being a rock-solid and totally rounded person someone thrust into this service must be.  It also shows that a life such as this can't live in a bubble and, sadly, may be adversely affected by others who see him as part of their problem.

Clint Eastwood is a highly capable film director who has really made an excellent movie here.  Just like the man the movie is about it will be brutally real to digest.  But, it doesn't shrink into any particular corner and it stands as a piece of art that truly depicts a life caught up in the myriad circumstances war creates.  I give it a high recommendation.",1455408000,7,1933,4.467236467236467

6970743,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I guess this was supposed to accompany the Super Bowl for some reason because it's been on HBO for the past couple of nights.  I remember the controversy about it and I'm not sure I understand why such a mediocre--even less than mediocre movie--could garner so much sensitivity.  Clint Eastwood degenerated pretty quickly from being a conservative filmmaker you could kinda, sorta sympathize with sometimes to just being a right wing nutcase.  His last movie about J. Edgar Hoover was sympathetic (I mean he sympathized with the actual guy.)  That should be all anyone needs to know.

This is worse than that movie.  Chris Kyle, a sniper who killed many a man woman and child in Iraq is portrayed as...Chris Kyle?  The kind of fellow you'd see in poverty eating fried chicken at a bowling hall on Fridays screaming about Mike Huckabee or Donald Trump are right about everything after a backbreaking week spent at a lower than minimum wage job; only Mr. Kyle was better than that.  He knew how to kill with an objectivity and impartiality that is rare even in seasoned combat veterans.  Bradley Cooper nailed this guy--I've met a lot of guys like him.

This is about as remarkable a movie, cinematically, as ""Broken Arrow"".  It's the portrayal of a vengeful, dangerous guy who participated in our unjust occupation of Iraq with a disturbing zeal.  In that, Eastwood portrays him very honestly.  What's Clint's next movie gonna be about?  The heroic parts of the Cambodian genocide?

I'd like to see a movie about Pat Tillman.",1454889600,,1524,4.8301158301158305

6970750,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"I thought the movie was okay.  I had issues with it already because I questioned the real story vs the Hollywood version.

I wanted to turn it off from the beginning after the extremely disturbing scene where a child was sent forth from its mother with a grenade.  I was stunned.  Of course, the child is not killed, but the implications were just unnerving.  I was already angry that mothers would sacrifice their children like this.  Yes, I'd read the news, heard of all the incidents involving children and I'm already sickened by it.  Why this needed to be embellished/changed in an already sick, sad story, I don't know.

The second time I wanted to turn it off was when a child was tortured with a drill to the leg and then killed (off-camera, thankfully) by a drill to the head.  I was disgusted and even more disgusted to find this never happened. I had to watch this awful scene only to find it wasn't real?  I was actually nauseous over this.  The movie attributed this to the wrong group and this scene never happened.  Holy propaganda.  Yes, this crap happened, but not to children (that I've found any information about).

I felt a bit manipulated.  Yeah, it's bad 'over there' and it's brutal.  But why things were changed to make it more dramatic than it already was, I don't know.  Did it make it more dramatic?  That wasn't necessary and I resented the liberties taken to make me more angry and upset than I already was.  I wanted the truth and I didn't quite get it.

With both situations, it reminds us of the ruthlessness and chaos going on 'over there'.  And these scenes in the movie made us more aware.  But they were false and unfair.",1454716800,,1658,4.493288590604027

6970775,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I finally watched American Sniper tonight, the film that has won countless awards and is recognized as a masterpiece by millions.  Does it live up to the hype?  For the most part, I'd say it does.  However...

Compared to most war films American Sniper probably isn't as good.  However the way it portrays the real life American sniper Chris Kyle, whether accurately or not (that's up to debate apparently, though don't ask me which events really happened and which ones are fabricated).  Bradley Cooper does a tremendous job portraying the many war tours Chris Kyle chose to persevere.  Talk about an *extremely* dangerous job.  Geez, this movie is proof I don't have what it takes to be a soldier in a million years.

Anyway there's several memorable scenes involving Chris' tour in Iraq.  The best scenes are the ones where Bradley and his troop are having dinner with an Iraqi family, and after the husband suspiciously drops his silverware on the floor Bradley senses something isn't right about the guy, so he explores his house and discovers bombs under the floorboards when bringing up the carpet.  Another memorable scene is the one that shows a little boy picking up a bazooka after Bradley snipes the Iraqi soldier preparing to use the gun, and Bradley's desperately hoping the boy doesn't fire the weapon so he doesn't have to wipe out a child.  Other memorable scenes involve Bradley's best friends getting shot and killed and how this messes with Bradley's mind.  A really dramatic ordeal Bradley had to go through.

The movie works like this- Bradley comes home after serving a tour, spends time with his wife (played by Sienna Miller) and children, goes back for another tour, and each time he returns the relationship with his family deteriorates as Bradley succumbs to post traumatic stress disorder.  This affects his marriage to the point Sienna threatens to leave him at one point, though perhaps she's understanding of the situation given the short phone calls the two have while Bradley's in the middle of a conflict and she's able to overhear the gunfire and explosions in the background.  This is why she was so adamant that Bradley stay home for good because let's be honest, a wife/mother can't handle that kind of stress for a long period of time.  I like how every time Bradley returns for another tour, his troop mates act strange.  They were obviously traumatized and never recovered from the things they noticed and had to do to protect themselves and their troop from the first tour.

The ending of the movie isn't very good.  SPOILERS!  It doesn't show how Chris Kyle dies.  Instead the final scene fades showing Sienna closing the front door of their house after getting a weird feeling watching Bradley jump in a car with another veteran.  She somehow knew this was going to be the final time she sees her husband alive.  Instead of showing how Bradley/Chris dies, a message appears on screen that says he died while trying to help a soldier.  Sort of disappointing, however the eerily quiet credits at the end is totally fitting and understandable given everything he went through.

The movie only occasionally touches on post traumatic stress disorder, and focuses more on the kind of man Chris Kyle was.  He was *very* patriotic according to this movie and would go to the ends of the earth to defend the country he loves.  Even Sienna didn't understand his devotion to our country.  In the beginning the way he was able to win over his wife even though she was skeptical of soldiers based on her experience with men serving their country is good writing.  Basically the movie focuses on Bradley positioned on rooftops sniping the bad Iraqis from a distance while the rest of the troop fight below by driving through dangerous territory, entering abandoned buildings and questioning anything suspicious.  Only occasionally does Bradley join them on the ground.  Lots of gunfire and explosions all over the place.  The movie does a good job (at least in my opinion, I could be wrong I admit) showing the war in Iraq and just how crazy and chaotic it is over there.

Really fantastic moving.  Best war movie ever?  Nah I wouldn't go that far, but it certainly is compelling enough to understand the hype surrounding it.  We just needed a better ending even though it would've been hard to watch.  Yes it stinks that someone who accomplished so much and helped so many had to die in such a crappy way, but I think it needed to be shown for closure.",1454630400,,4484,4.775324675324676

6970978,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Here we have the tale of an average American who answered the call...

Although the movie takes some liberties with the narrative that Kyle provided in his recent book, you still get the idea.

The ""controversy"" around this man is false, unfounded, and ridiculous. Chris Kyle, like everyone else, began his military career in the usual obscure manner, ...but quickly made his presence known in a venue that he excelled in. As a new recruit to the Navy, he chose to volunteer for the most challenging and hazardous duty as a Navy S.E.A.L.

He was a great American who willingly stood in harm's way for his fellow fighting-men. He was exceptional in his battle-skills, and he put forth maximum effort every time he picked up a weapon. He was one of the best friends the Marine Corps ever had. As a precision tactical marksmen he achieved a score that will be hard to surpass for quite some time.

Every one of his kills accounts for one less terrorist-animal. The world is a better place when natural hunters like Kyle put their skills to good use against the seemingly endless mob of criminal dregs that run rampant in certain places such as Iraq.

I arrived there in Mosul in April of 2006. In the first week, the enemy scum blew up an internet cafe in Tal Afar, just down the road. Several helicopters flew into F.O.B. Daimondback loaded with mangled children. I don't think any of the victims were older than 15 years of age.

Thats what kind of enemy America fought in Iraq: craven subhuman cowards that detonate bombs and run away to hide. Their targets were almost exclusively people who have no means to fight back.",1453161600,,1621,4.630662020905923

In my opinion, Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job representing Chris Kyle as the revered military hero he was.  Cooper does such a convincing job becoming Kyle that I forget I'm watching an actor portraying Chris Kyle.  This film realistically shows a bit of the way our military men's actions are being dangerously complicated by the current rules of engagement.  God bless Chris Kyle and his family and all the unheralded patriotic men and women who so unselfishly put themselves between us and the dangers they face to protect our freedoms.

6971066,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"This is a good movie which shows a proper warrior attitude in my opinion  The book shows the attitude better, but the movie is a smaller dose.  While Chris Kyle and Kaya's experience was different and in some ways more difficult and intense than my wife and I experienced during the Cold War and Viet Nam when I was a crew member on a B-52 bomber crew.  In many ways it is similar and the movie (and the book) makes those of us who gave some and the families of those who gave all remember and gives better perspective to those who were not required or perhaps were not able to walk the walk to understand what others did for them.  It points out effectively that everyone who served, whether voluntarily or drafted paid some price, but some paid more than others  It is not lost on me that those who were required to pull the trigger and witness the result had a more difficult lot than those of us who were never required to drop a nuclear weapon or see the carnage from the conventional weapons used to kill others.  Chris Kyle experienced more risk and saw more result than I, he was of a different generation, but showed an attitude similar to the one that I saw in myself and the warriors that I served with.  It is a great relief to know that the attitude lives on with later generations.",1452211200,,1295,4.304526748971194

6971120,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"American Sniper(released Nov/14)stars,among others,Bradley Cooper and  Sienna Miller. This story,based on true events of Navy Seal Chris Kyle,is a riveting one from beginning to end. Director Eastwood directs with a deft hand and gives us one of Cooper's best performances to date.
The story involves one Chris Kyle as we first see him in Iraq as a sniper about to fire his first in-combat shot,at a child given a grenade by his mother. The film then gives us the back story of his life and the events that led him to that place and time. Once we're back we see him shoot that child and then the mother who picks up the grenade and attempts to throw it at a group of Marines,until she too is felled by Kyle's second shot. His reaction to it all speaks volumes,as a testament to his job,others like him and to the man himself.
Kyle ends up doing four tours in Iraq and builds up quite the reputation. Many call him ""legend""(160+ kills,an all time high for a sniper),and many others still, admire his loyalty,tenacity,guts and patriotism. When he finally takes down a fellow enemy sniper who has claimed countless Marine lives,he heads back home for good. Stateside is an equally difficult time for Kyle,who has to regain who and what he was. As therapy he works with countless ex vets to ease their own transitions back to some kind of ""normalcy``.The film comes to an end as Kyle,after all he has been through,is killed by an ex vet he is trying to help at a rifle range. During the final credits we see actual film of his funeral and pictures of the real Kyle and his wife.
The picture over all is a moving testament to Kyle,the man, and all who serve,are still serving and those who have come back broken in limb and/or spirit.
Cooper is bang on with his portrayal of Kyle as are all his supporting actors. Miller`s angst in regards to Kyle`s service and attitude ring very true. All vets past and present can relate. It explains,in part, the divorce,suicide,drinking and abuse rates among vets.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are two discs here and the second one contains all the special features which include two features on the film.
All in all a touching portrayal of a real American hero and his journey to the front line and back home, to regain who he really is. Eastwood handles the film with a deft touch and captures the real life emotions of vets in general. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1451865600,2,2445,4.54421768707483

6971129,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"This is a ""fun"" jingoist film produced with the help of the military to make more tools of corporate military waste and fraud. Though it's fun in an 8th-grader shoot-em-up sort of way, it does a poor job of looking at the desperate lives of Iraqis who are cornered on all sides for destruction. The war was based on a lie by the great-grandson of a Hitler banker, Prescott Bush. The war did not defend America, but corporate interests such as profits for Halliburton, KBR, Blackwater and others. Bush's incompetent war left tons on depleted munitions which are causing horribly deformed babies, cancer and a host of other health-issues among the people we were supposedly liberating. Hussain was bad, but he was a CIA-trained agent. We left tons of military munitions and vehicles there that ISIS and others are now using.
Sniper isn't a hero, but a tool. He did his job well, but he was not fighting for freedom, but corporate America.
If we had rehired former Baathist party members, they would not have become unemployed. If you wanted to have a job, you had to be a Baath party member. They were the bureaucrats that made the country run. Instead instead of giving them freedom, we gave them chaos, and a grand opening for terrorists to gain a foothold.
Where's the story behind all those who become terrorists and insurgents because of the chaos we left behind? We keep dropping bombs that kill innocents. What do you think is going to happen? It Iraq was left in chaos to perpetuate an endless war to keep the Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex alive. For profit.",1451779200,,1576,4.7765567765567765

6971167,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I'm not one to watch rated R movies... so I knew that this one would be rough, both in language and in content.  With that being said, I think this is a VERY IMPORTANT movie to watch for a number of reasons.  American Sniper gives the viewer a small glimpse into what we are asking of our military in their service, something that we easily and frequently take for granted in our super comfortable lives over here.  Our active military and veterans deserve our respect, our best in services, and special accommodations and treatment when they return as they try to readjust to life over here.  There is a point in the movie when Chris Kyle returns and he is appalled to see that this war isn't even mentioned on TV and that most Americans aren't even aware of what our military is going through over there.  This movie opens that important discussion.  Furthermore, American Sniper compels the viewer to WANT to give back to our military.  This movie is also important because it pulls back the veil on the pure evil that our country is at war with.  The brutality, the heinous torture, the evil that is everywhere and carried out by a people who have worked to become desensitized to it and seem to enjoy it.  Men, women, and children, all picking up grenades in order to kill U.S. marines, it's so sad.  The main character feels the call of duty to eliminate the enemy over there before they come over here.  Americans would be wise to put down their  Candy Crush games and understand what this enemy is like because they ARE here and are committed to bringing more and more over here.
Lastly, this movie is a must see because it is the true story of a true American Hero, Chris Kyle.  His story is so genuine, that the viewer can relate to his journey and his struggles throughout the movie.  Chris Kyle's passion to protect both his fellow servicemen and ultimately, his fellow Americans, coupled with his amazing skill and accuracy will leave the viewer hauntingly speechless.  He embodies exactly what we want in a U.S. soldier.  He served 4 tours of duty because he recognized the reality of the enemy and wanted it to be HIM to serve instead of someone else that would go.  His sacrifice was simply amazing on so many counts.  This movie WILL CHANGE YOU, but I think we desperately need to heed it's wake up call.",1451260800,2,2321,4.525179856115108
6971168,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"This is a well written story with an excellent selection of actors and great directing, but the language at the beginning is over the top.

6971186,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"My first comment is about the DVD quality. The sound was terrible. We had to keep turning the volume way up to hear the dialogue, then when there were action sceens turn it down. I hate that. The movie itself was rather boring. I know Chris Kyle was a real person which is why it's even more disappointing. I didn't really care about any of the characters. I have no idea what his wife found appealing about him.  Some things were unrealistic.  Who calls home while perched on the roof looking for possible threats to their fellow soldiers? Apparently Chris Kyle! The other thing that really stuck out to me was in the final scene; Chris playfully points a gun at his wife and she smiles and plays along. I thought to myself ""it MUST be one of his childrens toy guns"" but as he turned to leave he put it on a high shelf with an audible ""thunk"" so I assume it was meant to show that it was real.  That made me mad. Guns should never be pointed at someone unless you are in a situation where you may actually need to shoot the person!  I won't say any more about the final scene other than I thought it was very flat and could have been handled better.",1451088000,,1150,4.213636363636364

I doubt that the real Kyle was as charismatic as Bradley Cooper is in this controversial take on U.S. involvement in the Middle East.

6971208,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood's well made but dangerous propaganda piece that most people will buy, hook, line and sinker. Even if you liked it, here's five reasons why Chris Kyle is no American hero and why you should reject the notion:

1. The Real Chris Kyle Made Up A Story About Killing Dozens of People In Post-Katrina New Orleans: Kyle claimed that he killed 30 people in the chaos of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, a story Louisiana writer Jarvis DeBerry calls preposterous.""  It shows the sort of mentality post-war Kyle had, but the claim doesn't appear in the film. If he lied about this, what else did he lie about? Even if it were true, when did looting become punishable by instant death? Think about it.

2. The Real Chris Kyle Fabricated A Story About Killing Two Men Who Tried To Carjack Him In Texas: Kyle told numerous people a story about killing two alleged carjackers in Texas. Reporters tried repeatedly to verify this claim, but no evidence of it exists.

3. The Real Chris Kyle Was Successfully Sued For Lying About the Former Governor of Minnesota: Kyle alleged that former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura defamed Navy SEALs and got into a fight with him at a local bar. Ventura proved he had never even met him and successfully sued Kyle for the passage in his book, and a jury awarded him $1.845 million.

4. It has been claimed by Chris Kyle, his family and estate, that all proceeds from his book have gone to charities to benefit veterans, but the National Review debunks the claim and reports that only around 2 percent  $52,000  went to the charities while the Kyles pocketed $3 million.

5. Chris Kyle's 'heroic' efforts are open to question. They could just as likely be war crimes. Do you really think if he killed 160 or 250 people they were all 'savages' like he labeled them? Over 200,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives in the war which accomplished nothing other than reaping billions in profits for companies like Dick Cheney's Halliburton. Wake up people!",1450742400,40,1999,4.724137931034483

6971281,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"Saudis perpetrated 9/11, but a person without much political wherewithal might be a useful idiot in a war against Iraqis which clearly did not avenge the deaths of 9/11 victims.

This idiot is Christ Kyle, a brave, heroic soldier exploited by cynical Jewish Neo-cons to fight a war for Israel against Iraq. The Iraq war was nothing but a carrying out of Israel's Clean Break Strategy, as crafty Jews manipulated white gentiles like Kyle to fight a war for them.

Similarly, King David sent Uriah the Hittite to die on the front lines so David could cover up impregnating Uriah's wife. In doing this the Semite David exploited the loyalty of Uriah, who spoke an Indo-European language (Hittite) much like Chris Kyle (English). Intelligence would have benefited Uriah more than loyalty, and the same holds true for Chris Kyle.

The head controls the body, and benevolent intellectuals need to guide warriors like Kyle so that they will not be made a Neo-con Jew's modern-day Uriah. Ultimately, the Iraq war was probably more of a failing of white gentile intellectuals for losing power and influence to Jews, and the result is that warriors like Chris Kyle ended up having to pay the price.

I would not recommend lionizing Mr. Kyle as a role model but only as a tragic figure.",1449964800,3,1275,4.808219178082192

Shows the mind trips he goes through along with his family life and how truly hard it is, to be a spouse of a SEAL.  This man, Chris Kyle who became a legend in his own right as a top sniper and the effects on his life at  home and abroad.  I would recommend this to any person who is a patriot and loves their country.  It shows what Chris gave up to give his all.  What a hell of a MAN.  Everyone should see this movie, it's so realistic and brings it right home.

6971556,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"Cliched, cornball, silly, and insulting to the audience. Absolutely ridiculous dialogue. We didn't care about anyone. A movie must make you care.

When he was on the phone (in Iraq) with his wife (presumably in Texas), holding the gun and looking through the sight, obviously on duty as she asks if he wants her to talk dirty to him, that was the last straw. It is the ultimate insult to an audience to show a character doing something that is not what a normal person would do in a situation. Corny corny corny. A soldier is allowed to take calls while working as a sniper? Oh, please.

This is an overblown, overhyped Dirty Harry with absolutely no character development that we could discern and wooden acting all around. The SEAL training mainly consisted of being sprayed by water. That's the best Clint could come up with? I will admit that my partner gave up after the dirty talk scene and I did soon afterward. There is no compelling story here and the film is poorly edited, jumping from scene to scene that not only fail to move the story forward but succeed at both boring and confusing the viewer.

I am no fan of Eastwood. His films are terribly overrated and I'm not afraid to say it. Never again.",1448064000,8,1211,4.52054794520548

The men and women who volunteer to serve in our military often put their lives on the line, this story tells the true story about how it affects not only the volunteer, but their spouses and children and when they are released from service, the mental anguish they endure. This story tells about how this man found peace by helping others coming home from the wars only to be killed by one of those persons he was trying to help.

If, perchance, you did not read the book, you will see a good portrayal of what it means to be an American fighting man in this day and age, and what it means to be a sniper.  If, however, you are not a rifle shooter, you will get some strong misconceptions.  It aint as simple as it's made to look.  On another level, you will see the trials of being an American fighting man when not deployed.  Remember when you meet one of those guys, they do it for us and for the country.  Eastwood is to be commended for putting together an honest, objective visualization of what modern was is about.  It is not pretty, but you should know what it is.

Even my husband gave it a thumbs down.,1445644800,,293,4.444444444444445
6971911,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"This movie has received much criticism for being either too much ""pro-American warmongering"" or too clearly ""a pacifist call for an end to all wars disguised as a love story.""

As usual, the critics are both right and wrong.  The movie itself has only limited value as a propaganda piece for either the pro-war or the anti-war camp.  It is a love story, but it is also several love stories and only one of them is romantic. The horrors of war are personified not by endless scenes of power-crazed white American soldiers mowing down row after row of ""faceless brown enemies"", but by the uncanny frequency of women and children who either attempt to fight alongside insurgents, or who playfully pick up weapons dropped by dead insurgents and point them at American soldiers. One of the things that makes this movie so morally ambiguous is how often Chis Kyle must choose whether or not to kill a woman or child who has wandered into the battlefield area and how each time he is faced with this decision he chooses differently.

To enhance dramatic impact and move his storyline along, the script writer took great liberty with the character of an Al Qaeda sniper named, ""Mustafa"".  We are told many things that are simply not true, such as Mustafa being a former Olympic shooter. I guess the writer could not imagine a non-American who could stalk and shoot as well as an American without some kind of non-military/non-police background to make the sniper appear as human as Chris Kyle's character.  This bit of exaggeration was quite disappointing for me as a viewer, especially since in Chris Kyle's book Mustafa never appears as a character and is only mentioned in passing in one or two minor references.

The movie is a well-told tale and great pains are taken to avoid being either extremely pro-war or extremely anti-war. However, the moral ambiguity does not have a strong impact on the story itself.  If you are the kind of person who demands absolute moral clarity in war movies (either for or against war), then this movie is going to disappoint you because the issue of war's necessity versus war's horror takes a backseat to the development of Chris Kyle's character from troubled young man to responsible father.",1445644800,,2225,4.7911227154047

Once i viewed the movie i realized everything he has/had verbalized to me was factual. Really hit close to home and literally brought a tear or two to my eyes. I can emphatize now what Chris Kyle's parents, wife and children not to mention all those he touched while on this earth went and must still be going through. I highly recommend anyone to purchase it and view it in its entirely its worth viewing. Your served your country exceptionally well and i salute you for your service to this great nation. You most definitely are in heaven enjoying the reaps of your great sacrifice to our great nation.

6971937,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Truly excellent movie.  Liberals hate it because the movie points out that these young men are human, not the cold-blooded killers that the politically correct try to portray them as.  Many sitting at home fail to appreciate the physical and emotional stress that our soldiers are subjected to in and after combat situations.  This movie does a pretty damn good job showing this. Remember this movie, and especially the stirring  tribute in Dallas at the end,  the next time you see a soldier outfitted in desert camo  in an airport terminal about to head off to the middle east or returning home.  It is okay to go up to the soldier and thank him or her for their sacrifice and service to our great country.",1445472000,,708,4.616

The real tragedy is that a nut case took his and his friend's life when he was earnestly trying to do good. If you want to see a gritty and realistic drama that will give you a look into war, see ""The Hurt Locker"". This portrays the true pain of a soldier who has extremely dangerous missions, and eventually his obsession and addiction to them, until it takes over his life.

6971973,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Way too long at 2 hours and 15 minutes and kind of boring.  It was just okay--and I am a Bradley Cooper fan-- and truthfully his cuteness was the only thing that kept me watching this.  The movie was boring in parts and was way too long.  Maybe I needed to see it in a theater instead of at home with maybe too many distractions.  But directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, I guess I expected more.  It was just short sentences by Cooper when they showed him stateside and lots of shooting, bombings and bloodshed when he was overseas.  Yes, we get it - war is hell.  It was interesting to see the changes in the main character--but maybe it took a bit too long to get to that part of the movie and too little was spent on this aspect of the movie.  Oh and Cooper holding the obviously fake baby in a poignant scene was ridiculous.  I feel like the movie would have been better if more time had been spent on the stateside adjustments and more scenes between Chris and his wife.",1444953600,2,995,4.25

6971999,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Saw it in theaters, for a movie this a three (out of five) star piece of work. As for it having reference to the American campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan it's completely unrepresentative (in my opinion (Ive read about a dozen books from sources of different leanings and with different credentials)) of what happened and based off of the words of a man who, again, from my understanding, was a pathological liar and most likely had a slew of congenital defects or deep seated psychological problems that were left untreated. Jesse Ventura sued Kyle in court and won over Kyle claiming that the two had been in a bar fight that never occurred, Kyle's life as he portrays it in his book is filled with fallacies and outright lies. That being said I'm very grateful for the work our troops have done.
But this is just a movie, not a docu, if you're looking for a factually accurate account of what occurred on the ground during the campaigns I suggest you look elsewhere, if you would like a good war movie this is decent and new(ish).",1444608000,,1034,4.564516129032258

6972013,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I took a look at some of the lesser reviews and mostly they seem to have issues with the movie not sticking to the book, or it telling a political tale.

I have not read the book so I don't know if it follows the book well, but the way movies have to be it is very hard to turn a book into a movie. A book can afford to take whatever time is necessary. A movie has to do that in 2 hours. And to be truthful, the movie audience is not the same as the people who like to read. Movies are about having entertainment served up to you in two hour chunks, and that two hours has to make the audience enjoy it or the movie has failed.

The movie tells the story of a US seal sniper in Iraq who spends his time there over three tours protecting US Marines from enemy snipers and enemy soldiers. He gets to be really good, even if a few times he has to take a few shots that he probably would have preferred not to have to take, but he had the moral courage to take them when needed.

His occupation interferes with his marriage and eventually he decides his family is more important and he leaves Iraq only to find out he can't just leave. The war comes back with him to some extent and he does not find any peace until he starts helping other vets who have come back but the war has not completely left them either.

The movie ends with pictures of his funeral at Cowboys Stadium after he is killed by a deranged vet he tried to help.",1444521600,,1427,3.9964912280701754

6972047,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Disappointing. It was hard to determine what the movie was about. A couple of minutes of him sniping at targets he couldn't identify. The rest of the time he's shooting at the bad guys with his battle rifle. The one long shot he made was totally unrealistic. There were Cobras, it would have been a lot more effective to just have them take care of the problem. Or call TacAir, A10s or F15Cs and let them handle it. Or just call in an artillery strike. He didn't seem particularly heroic, more egotistical and out of control. He was a sadist, calling his wife during the middle of a firefight; not to mention he was constructively abandoning his duties and his buddies when he did it. Actually, after the first tour, he pretty much treated his wife & kids like dirt.

The production values and continuity were a problem, too. He's on top of a building, shooting straight down at the enemy and there are no bullet strikes where the rounds missed and hit the dirt. Why they sent the whole platoon up there made no sense. They knew they were surrounded by insurgents, yet the isolated themselves on a nearly unescape proof roof. Maybe I didn't see it, but I am not really sure how they got out of a building surrounded by enemy when their close air support was so bad they entirely missed their target and shot the wrong building.  Then the cobras seemed to disappear, like they only brought one missile. None of the Cobras fired the 20mm cannon they brought to the party. There was  no tac air, there would have been fighters and ground attack aircraft (Apaches, A10s, F15Cs, a lot more Cobras) filling the sky. The only reason I figure there weren't was the brass really didn't like these guys.

It doesn't seem to make much sense to give emotionally unbalanced people suffering from PTSD-maybe TBIa rifle. I am glad he got over his PTSD and all that, but then he made some really dumb decisions after he left the service.

I was gobsmacked that Hurt Locker was even nominated for any academy award, it was a terrible movie. How this garnered 6 nominations amazes me. It was a terrible movie, with no continuity and no real story. At least the academy members had the sense not to give this Best Picture. (What is it with Iraq/Afghanistan, not matter what kind of trash you make, you automatically get nominated for best picture because your film is about the war?) If the movie version of Chris Kyle is as good as SEALs get, no wonder we lost Iraq and are on our way to losing Afghanistan. (To be fair, no rational person believed there would be any other way for the war to end. In the 55 years since we first put advisors on the ground in Vietnam, nobody seems to have learned you can't fight an asymmetrical war, symmetrically.)

Take a pass on this movie and Hurt Locker, you'll not regret it. Neither of them are anywhere as  good as they are hyped to be. If you want the authenticity, then watch Generation Kill.",1444176000,2,2918,4.494339622641509

Most of the movie is given over to roof-posted snipers blowing enemy soldiers' heads off, blood splattering against walls, and our own soldiers getting bloodied and killed by enemy arms fire.  Bradley Cooper portrays Kyle, but it's a one-note performance -- the script gives no depth whatsoever to the character, nor does he seem to connect emotionally with any of the other characters, including his long-suffering wife.  The fact that Kyle died in an inexplicably bizarre manner getting shot on a gun range is hardly justification for devoting a movie to him.  You don't get any true sense that Kyle's combat exploits are ""legendary"" based on what is presented in this film.",1443830400,,850,5.00709219858156

6972111,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper in an Academy-Award nominated performance) was a trained military sniper, maybe the best who ever pulled the trigger from among hidden locales, usually the rooftops of buildings. According to the film, during military tours in Iraq in the early 2000's, Kyle had 160 kills to his name, mostly males, but sometimes females and even children. Was Kyle engaging in right and moral behavior whose efforts should be applauded because he protected his fellow soldiers and helped wrest Iraq from Saddam Hussein? Or was he a brutal mass murderer, whose exploits should have brought him before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity? However, I think the point of this film is to answer neither of those questions. This is simply Kyle's story.

The film focuses on Chris Kyle, an outstanding Navy Seal sniper who began as a would-be rodeo star who had experience hunting and shooting when he was young. In an interesting flashback scene, his dad claims there are three kinds of people in the world: sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. The sheepdogs are the ones who protect the sheep from the wolves. The idea becomes a metaphor for who Kyle becomes and the role he will play in the US military. After having failed at being a rodeo star, Kyle signs up for military service in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. To the surprise of his superiors during basic training, he shows exceptional ability in shooting targets at long distance. He's the kind of material who could be a sniper for the Navy Seals.

The film chronicles four of Kyle's tours-of-duty in the Middle East. During each mission, his role as a sniper is primarily to assist his fellow ground soldiers, sometimes with them on the ground, while at other times in hidden places, usually atop small buildings. In one mission, they are assigned the impossible task of finding Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the primary heads of Al-Quaeda. In probably the most disturbing sequence, Kyle and his fellow soldiers sporting heavy-duty automatic firearms enter houses looking for Zarqawi. One older man with his family claims to have information, but for a price. Then a scene or two later, Al-Quaeda operatives, in particular one nicknamed ""the Butcher"", force the family to pay a deadly price for speaking with the enemy. Instead of receiving payment for their information, the family receives the ultimate punishment. And yet, the scenes play out such that they have no choice but to cooperate with the Americans and yet are pressuring Al-Quaeda to retaliate against them, at least from the terrorists' point of view.

Another fascinating element of the film is Kyle's ""mirror"", an individual on the other side who has a similar position and/or ability to Kyle. Kyle realizes a sniper is taking out American soldiers and other combatants at nearly the same success rate as himself. Essentially, Kyle has found his middle-eastern counterpart, a sniper with the same abilities as his own, except he speaks Arabic. Kyle and the American soldiers then realize they are engaged in a violent chess match in which Kyle and his counterpart-enemy are the most deadly pieces on the board.

One of the best and most poignant war films ever made, similar in style to ""The Hurt Locker"". The question which looms above the entire story is whether or not Kyle is doing the right thing. I think the film tries and succeeds to make the case that the issue is not whether Kyle was either moral or immoral. It's about the United States. Should the United States have engaged in an all-out assault on Iraq? In terms of military tactics, snipers are necessary to carry out missions. So the question is not whether or not Kyle should or should not have been sniping. The question is whether the ""powers-that-be"" in Washington D.C. should have deployed troops in the first place, which would necessitate the use of a cracker-jack sniper. It neither condemns nor applauds war. It simply shows what it's like from ground-zero.

As a footnote, the film ends with real footage from Kyle's funeral procession in which people waved American flags as they passed. (Kyle was killed by a fellow soldier suffering from PTSD after her retired from military service.) Does this mean the filmmakers viewed Kyle as a hero? Not necessarily. It simply showed Americans viewed him as a hero and he received accolades for his efforts. At the same time, Kyle did the duty he was trained for. We in America must debate and elect leaders who will make the right decisions in terms of military deployment. We must take responsibility for the fact that we need snipers when we put our soldiers into harm's way.",1443744000,,4649,4.887198986058301

6972177,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"After all the talk, I was disappointed. It bothers me when Hollywood distorts the real story into something that may work dramatically better. Lots of people will see this movie--or a fiction even more distorted, like Oliver Stone's JFK, and they'll take it as the truth. The hero of this movie was a psychopath, IMHO, torture never produced much good intelligence, and the USA was completely wrong to have abandoned its ideals by resorting to torture and barbarism. That aside, I wasn't swept away with the drama and emotion of the movie at all. I find Clint Eastwood to be a rather dry director who shows me a lot of things but doesn't reach my heart. Bradley Cooper, however, certainly disappeared into his role completely. Too bad it wasn't in a better movie.",1443139200,2,763,4.7443609022556394

6972315,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"For the most part I liked this movie. I admire Mr. Kyle's commitment to serve our country and certainly appreciate the sacrifices made by him and all our men and women who do the same. What I didn't care for was the over the top profanity. Yes, when I watch a war movie it is expected and I feel  it reflects reality. What I did not expect was that every person in this movie, male or female, couldn't seem to finish a sentence without dropping the f-bomb at least once, if not two or three times. Secondly, I was disappointed that whenever Chris and Taya Kyle's characters had a conversation they were either fighting or talking about sex. I understand the pressures they must have been facing as a military family and the problems that separation can cause, but, c'mon, marriages have to be based on something deeper. What they shared sexually is not information I needed. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, considering that Clint Eastwood produced and directed this film. He's the king of over-emphasis. He picks a profane word or a point he wants to make and he drives it into the ground. The war story in this movie was excellent. The love story, not so much.",1442361600,,1170,4.545023696682464

6972349,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"This is a great film not so much by the true story it tells as by the meaning Clint Eastwood tries to set on the table with force and poignancy.

In spite of all the heroism, the patriotism and the courage of these American men (note there are no women) sent to Iraq the war is lost and totally sinking in a quagmire of a cesspool because it is a useless and absurd war: there is no support for the Americans? There is no gratefulness from the Iraqis. The American troops only speak one language which is Arabic, and with interpreters in-between, which cuts them off from the vast majority of the population who speak Kurdish or Farsi, two Indo-European languages. Arabic is the language of the minority Sunni Iraqis, and whats more the language of the tyrant the Americans came to rid the country of.

The film shows in the worst possible horror the fact that this war has no future, had no future and it has led to an even far worse situation than before. And it was all based on a lie.

But the film can in no way be reduced to that.

The film is about the real damage done on these men (once again no women). They come back traumatized and blocked in their patriotism that becomes the cover-up of their trauma. They are going through a Post-Traumatic-Stress-Syndrome and no one can ever negate that. This sniper killed more than 160 people, most of them one by one in direct one-on-one fire since he was aiming his gun at them with the will to kill them and no others, and with only one bullet for each one, with the excuse that it was to protect his fellow soldiers. That goes against the very human instinct of survival which is that of the species and that should mean killing non-human dangers. That implies the enemies are not human. That implies the sniper is then completely deadlocked in his artificial though perfectly real mental coffin. He cannot speak. He cannot relate even to his children or to his partner.

That in itself is a crime against humanity. And yet Chris Kyle manages to get over it by dedicating his post-war life to helping the veterans who are suffering like him. By helping them he alleviates his own suffering. And thats when the film is a masterpiece for something like five or seven minutes. He is killed in the USA by one veteran that he takes one day to some kind of one-on-one session of physical exertion to help that veteran step over his PTSS. He is killed by one of his own side who cannot bear the consequences of his actions in Iraq, who has become insane with that Trauma. Clint Eastwood is of course extremely cautious not to imply, like a series is doing on TV, that this veteran was more or less manipulated by the insurgents in Iraq. This is here a pure act of insanity caused by the PTSS of one man.

This film is also very interesting because it shows with the periods between the four tours, with the birth of the children and their growing up, the passage of time, of years, and yet at the same time from one tour to another there is no change in Iraq itself the way the film describes the situation, we can even wonder if it is not getting worse. The final killing of the insurgent sniper by this American sniper will not change anything because one disappears and probably two or three can rise, or pop up where they are least expected.

Thats when we really understand that we made a mistake by going there in the very first place. The fall of a dictator has to come from the victims of this dictator and not from foreign troops. Saddam Hussein was not Hitler with his armed forces occupying about twelve countries if not more. We completely overlooked the linguistic and cultural situation, and we go on doing so. The Kurds are in the front row against Isis but some factions of these Kurds take advantage of the situation to restart the civil war against the Turks. And some in the West want to send troops on the ground? There is no folly that is unreachable to some politicians. They never learn.

And how many Islamist propagandists are among the refugees that are trying to flow into Europe right now? It is so easy to be a war refugee since by principle war refugees have lost everything and first of all their identity papers and birth certificates. We humanely must help these refugees but we have to know that they are not all refugees, which implies they go through sorting out camps where they will be humanely treated but also identified and cleared up on their motivations, and also that they are going to be the new slaves of the west because they will have to work sooner or later. They are not doctors and engineers most of them, probably even nearly all of them.

This film tries to make us feel that when one mistake is made there is no end to it and even stepping out of it is not an end because the problem comes back through the window when it has been swept out through the door, and if there is no window it will use the chimney. The war in Iraq was a typical 19th century colonial war and it led to the very same catastrophes. Will we ever learn the lessons of Vietnam and Algeria, to give two examples? I guess not.

AMERICAN SNIPER, presents a nonfictional account of a US Navy Seal Sniper named Chris Kyle. This movie is a biography, and a respectful portrayal of a US Navy Seal's life.

This review focuses on the action sequences, and story. A huge crash occurs on the battlefield in Iraq where the convoy is seeking revenge for one of their own. The collision is an attempt to block the path but the US Military appears to have an unstoppable amount of momentum. No injuries from the crash. This crash adds to the overall pace of action. It is showing the convoys maneuverability, and showing the military's ability to survive Iraq's obstacle course that caused the numerous US Military casualties, injuries and fatalities.

Sadly, the movie appears to have a sad for another young American serviceman, that became known to many as, ""The Legend"". He is recreated in the movie as an iconic Seal, with an extensive amount of experience as a Sniper and Seal. He also appears to be a  helpful trainer that leads by example to those surrounding him, showing his ability to build a team wherever in Iraq. His efforts were shown to build a team in a way to help save teammembers lives, while still completing the mission's objectives, defeating a counter insurgency across urban and rural Iraq.

This movie appears so realistic, the audience can expect to see some scenes like they were right there. One memorable scene is the ending shootout on his final deployment where a sand storm covers Kyle's unit and nearly causes him to be left behind while under attack. The sand storm appears to save him as a form of cover, which is an interesting description and point of view of the weather in Iraq. But, the storm also appears to have added additional unpredictability, and a near casualty.

The feelings of the, ""fog of war"" and the chaos special operators faced, and survived, are recreated in this movie.

Kyle moves back to Texas where he tragically becomes fallen, but only surviving the dangers of being deployed as a Navy Seal. He appears to have known so much about how to survive on the battlefield, building a strong reputation. His death is an unfortunate casualty.

It shocked the audience, and the US Military and US public, but he was memorialized with a respectful funeral at the end of the movie. Chris Kyle knew more than most deployed with the military since the 911 tragedy. But, was also appearing as a character that shared his experience, and provided a helping hand to those in need. A helpful Legend, the military will not forget.",1441843200,,2572,4.790067720090294

It was the biography of an american hero with single-minded determination to protect his country from terrorists post-911 by serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a sniper. It is a simple fact he saved hundreds, possibly thousands of american troop lives doing his job. This movie does not glorify war, it does show the sacrifice some are willing to endure to support our everyday way of life. This is not a movie for PC zombies.",1441584000,,657,4.6239316239316235

6972514,5,B00SB9Y6KW,The movie jumps through some parts and you need to fill in some timeline with your imagination.  It is understandable though.  It's probably a 3 hour movie if they tried to develop the story much more. I think most guys in the U.S. Had the same thoughts about trying to do something to help after 9/11.

6972522,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Very affecting.  Bradley Cooper does a fine job in the lead role, and the action sequences are tense and realistic.  The final, fraught rooftop battle was heart-stopping, which it needed to be since it was the turning point for Kyle, who now had had enough and wanted to get back to his family.  The only anomaly in this film were scenes in which, sometimes in the middle of an action, he whipped out his phone and called home.  That isn't how it works over there.  I thought Eastwood made the right choice not to show Kyle's death: one look at the haunted face of his soon-to-be-killer and you got it.  Whether or not one approves of idolizing someone who has killed over 100 people, and some do not, it is a movie worth seeing.",1441411200,,729,4.402985074626866

The acting in this movie was so good, I forgot I was watching actors, and felt like I was watching their real lives unfold.  Even though I had seen Bradley Cooper in other movies, in this movie I didn't see him as Bradley Cooper, he was Chris Kyle.  All of the actors were amazing.",1440892800,,560,4.196261682242991

6972680,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Thrilling, sad, heroic...Chris Kyle should never be forgotten and always be honored.  I am not going to post what the movie is about plenty of others have done that.  I will say, instead, after watching it changed my viewpoint about the War...inspired me to volunteer for the VFW...and be forever grateful to men like Chris and his wife, who's role was underplayed, I think, in their love story.  Members of my immediate family refuse to see this movie, as they disagree with the War, or think it is another, typical war movie; nothing could be farther from the truth.  I would say, don't be blind...open your eyes to the reality of what other country's are doing that is wrong; our part in it; what are we going to do to keep it from coming here, to our cities?  We can't live in a  shell and pretend it's not happening.  The movie is still a movie; I think it could have made it clearer how PTSD affects so many 1000's of our soldiers and how easy it is for us ""normal""  folk to look the other way and ignore it.  That point could have been played up a bit more.  Because i don't think the majority of people, having never experienced combat, will quite understand some of the things left unsaid.  The performances of all are powerful and believable, the final scenes of the funeral procession will be overwhelming with intensity and the sheer love our country felt for this man; I wish so much I could have been there. You will feel like you ARE there, having witnessed a life so special, so called to duty, you are speechless with awe.  I'm sure there are more men similar to Chris Kyle serving our country...I am deeply in gratitude and humbled to know you are out there.  As a P.S., I have watched this movie 3 times.... for you doubters, just watch it once.  It will at least provide much food for thought, no matter what your feelings are about the Mid-east War.  And as movies go, you won't see better acting anywhere.  The story is compelling, the side plots interesting...you won't fall asleep. :)",1440720000,,2008,4.475274725274725

It made we wonder why in the hell we're in Iraq when it demonstrated the majority of the Iraqi people didn't want us there. Vietnam all over again. We never seem to learn from history. Wars with ridiculous rules of engagement will never be won. Wars cannot be micromanaged from the White House.

As a war movie, this entertaining and compelling.  It tells the story of legend well, and is the best PTSD representation I have seen on film.
The reason I say I won't watch it again was a scene where a child is tortured to death in front of the parents.  I know this is an important part of telling the story, but that doesn't mean I want to see it again.  The rest of the movie was great.",1440547200,,523,3.9903846153846154

As a Catholic, Christian, and Combat Infantry Veteran, I avoided the VFW, The American Legion, etc.because I saw such activities as more of the same when I returned from war.  War is something to be hated, and avoided at all costs, never should anyone glofify it or those who involved in it.  George W. Bush Caused the United States to invade Iraq, and began that UnNecessary and Unjust war based entirely on LIES.  Bush should have been tried then, as a war criminal,  Satan is the Father of Lies, and we listened to those lies and brave men lost their lives, for nothing.  Iraq had No WMD, No Involvement in the Massacres on 9-11-2001, and posed No Credible Threat to the United States.  War must be opposed by everyone who prays for peace on earth.",1440460800,,809,4.5

it through his eyes and feeling it with him. The end is heartbreaking. This is a searing movie, beautifully crafted and it will stay with you for a long time. Kudos to Mr. Eastwood for his pitch perfect direction.",1440374400,,486,4.126315789473685

Not knowing anything about being in battle, is personal cell phone use allowed? It just seemed odd that he would be calling his wife during the heat of battle. Another detail I questioned...his obviously pregnant wife is outside the hospital taking one of his calls, surrounded by medical-type people. She is in distress and her legs sort of collapse under her, and no one even glances towards her. Nitpicking I know, but just a few little details like these that had me wondering if this was the best we could do for this hero.

6972823,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"First and foremost I am not a fan of war and/or war-related movies.  For example I have not seen ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now""...and have to plans to see them.  I watched this because a friend insisted I had to see Bradley Cooper's performance.  So let me start there.  Cooper gives a very strong, very understated nuanced performance.  It's very difficult to play someone who by nature is an introvert.  Two or three times maybe Cooper has one or two lines that give us an insight into the real-life man he's playing, but that's it.  His best work is done while his finger is on the trigger, trying to determine whether a mother or her child need to be taken out because they're carrying a concealed weapon.  In fact those are the best scenes in the movie.  Unfortunately Eastwood goes back to it a couple times too many.  After a while it seems like we've seen this scene already...is that all you've got?  Seriously by the time we got to the ""fourth tour"" ...was there anything left to say?  Sienna Miller was ...ok...but there wasn't much for her to do.  None if the myriad questions regarding our involvement in this war are even brought up.  The most interesting aspect of the movie to me, actually in the true life story as well...is why one veteran killed another, especially this one.  That might have made a better movie, but it seems like Eastwood, for whatever reason, didn't want to spend that much time on this.  This isn't a political review.  I am in no position to judge whether or not this man is a hero.  I just wish the movie about him had been better. Make me want to read the book maybe.  This one didn't do it.",1440201600,2,1633,4.456081081081081

Must be the times and the way media spreads like wildfire nowadays. I feel more for all the guys that died on the battlefields, not the ones that died here at home.  War is war, killing is killing, pansies are pansies and they always want to hate warriors, but they still send them over to fight, don't they?  Pretty simple to me.

6972874,4,B00SB9Y6KW,I expected to cry through the whole movie. There have a few Clint Eastwood movies that have really pulled at my emotions. This one did not. I think Easteood did a good job of telling the story as it was and there were no heros. My only complaints were the husky fake baby. I mean they didn't have enough money to get a real baby!!! It was like watching a soap opera. I also didn't like the Iraqi sniper. He seemed a bit too superhero like for me to think he was real!,1440028800,,467,4.032258064516129

I have seen Chris interviewed on television 3 or 4 times and was impressed with his candor, patriotism and love of his fellow soldiers.  It was like being gut punched when I learned he was killed by a disturbed vet he was trying to befriend and help.  May we have more young men like him.",1440028800,,403,4.47945205479452

6972889,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"Utter nonsense. ""Let's train them up."" Really? This film makes Marines look like a bunch of poorly trained wimps and Seals out to be gods of war. Seals die just as easily as Marines in combat, and as a former Marine who served two tours in Iraq when Mr. Kyle was there, I found this film insulting and borderline propaganda. Of course, it fits perfectly into Mr. Eastwood's oeuvre of films that always champion violent, psychopathic white men who are the only solution for a chaotic world under constant threat by people of color and mindless ""savages.""

Never a big fan of anything that's ""based on a true story"", because it's pretty much never the ""true story"" and that takes away from the film in my opinion.  If this were just promoted as a movie unrelated to an actual person, then I'd probably have enjoyed it more.  Overall though, worth watching.

6973034,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I'll be honest. I never served in the military so it isn't a world I can easily relate to. I have not read the book either so I really can't comment on the accuracy of the book to film translation.

 As a stand alone film this is one of the best modern war films I've ever seen. The performance from Cooper was beyond incredible. Pacing, action were all astounding.

But considering this was based, very loosely from what I've read, on real events the film will also make you ponder war and its far reaching effects on our troops.

I believe Chris was a man that fought and thought with his heart but not his mind. So many guys wanted to ""kill some terrorists"" after 9/11. Their hearts were in the right place and so many, sadly gave their lives to a lie. The real terrorists were right at home under our noses the whole time. Devotion to our country has been confused with blind devotion to our war pig, criminal politicians who have no problem starting wars for profit based on flat out lies.

I don't hate our troops. Just the opposite. I cherish their lives and hate to see the greedy and powerful use them as pawns. Their lives matter just as much as everyone else. The film also touches on the after care of our troops, or lack thereof when they return. If we can't afford to take care of our troops after the fact, then we have no business sending them to war in the first place.

If anything the film will make you think and you better have a box if tissue at the end. Kyle was a product of our military. A soldier, an American but sadly not a very deep thinker. Good movie.",1439596800,,1582,4.256666666666667

6973107,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"""Heroes survive wars regardless of the winner"" is a statement I once heard from a Lit. Professor, and I always liked it. I think because his larger inference was ""whether they're YOUR hero or not, special men and women tend to find their way across enemy lines and far into the history because the enemy remembers them too."" Chris Kyle is one such person, so was the Beast or whatever they called the other sniper. I am proud to be American (most of the time) and I will always support and respect our service men and women. The Psychologist in me feels compelled to point out that the real Kyle's compartmentalization of his emotions borders on the kind of emotional surgery you expect in ""secondary psychopathy"", but I don't think, regardless of that diagnosis being thrown at him in the media or through the hyperbole of idiots like Michael Moore he deserves it.

Kyle is (was, now, R.I.P.) a soldier, he trained to be one, he fought in a war as one, he lived to serve others with his experience outside of the battlefield, and he died doing such. The man epitomizes the definition the word ""soldier"" evokes in me to the letter. I only got about 2/3s through the book before the movie came out, and I couldn't help myself with all the buzz, I went and saw the movie the second week it was out before reading any further.

My impression from the book is that Kyle was far more ""matter of fact"" in his approach to the war than the movie paints him out to be. He simply saw ""enemies"" after so many trigger pulls, because that's what he had to do. He didn't see women, children, or fathers and brothers, mothers, etc. because he couldn't afford to. Every potential threat was one that could kill someone on his side, and while he was apparently very good at dehumanizing the opposition, he was equally good at humanizing his comrades. To him, the Jihadists were targets, and he was good at shooting them. Very good.

I don't want to drone on, so I will end this here, if you read the book, I think you will like the movie, though I didn't finish it I found the two to be acceptably in sync. Kyle is a bit romanticized, as are the situations covered, but that is just a byproduct of transforming the reality into something people will sit in a theater and watch. I have garnered a lot of respect for Mr. Eastwood as a director, and this movie only served to deepen that. I think it's a fantastic piece of cinema, and if you don't cry watching it you're not a man.",1439337600,2,2461,4.404395604395605

6973174,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwoods American Sniper (2015) is similar to 2014s Lone Survivor in that they're both straight war flicks based on true stories, the former taking place in Iraq and the latter in Afghanistan. While these movies are similar in theme, tone and quality, I give American Sniper the edge.

Most reading this realize that Kyle was murdered in 2013, along with Chad Littlefield, as they were helping some piece of sheet with his post-traumatic stress disorder. In February, 2015, the scumbag was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Since American Sniper is about a recent American hero with, by far, the most kills of any American sniper in history (on record, that is), its obviously pro-American and, consequently, indirectly ant-liberal. As such, the film gets raves from conservatives and utter loathing from far-left types. (Why a loony leftist would even want to see a movie like this is puzzling.

The story is well constructed with good direction and acting.  You feel for the loss as you go along, and have some empathy for what happens on screen.  My wife also liked this - and actually read the book before I did.  This is not one of the traditional war movies of the 1960's, but truly tries to depict what returning veterans face with their lives and families.

6973271,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I have not yet read his book, but I was intrigued by Chris Kyle, many times over, after I saw him interviewed on tv.  When the movie was released in theaters, it was a must see for me.  The room was packed and it was the first time I'd ever been in a theater when, at the end of the movie, and as everyone filed out, there was complete, utter silence.  It was a powerful movie, and an even more powerful story, brilliantly written, directed, and cast.  Bradley Cooper did an absolutely amazing job portraying Kyle and while I've never really followed his career, or his movies, I believe there is not one other actor who could have done Kyle the justice Cooper did.  If only the movie could have had a different ending...  The American Sniper was an amazing man, an amazing soldier, an amazing American and his critics should really be ashamed of themselves for the things they said about him.

It is another example of some other very good modern wartime movies being made over the last decade.  Showing some of the realities that even the very best of us struggle with and eventually can only take so much of.  The irony of the story is amazing and sad.

They don't realize  that a sniper job is to take out the enemy which hopefully take out the enemy and open the door for the safety troops.  It is a hard thing to do, be a sniper a takes type of person in all ways.  This is about  I can say for now.

6973326,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"This movie's director and producers went to great lengths to allow the (real life) character's of the movie to be shown in the most realistic fashion...This may be the best portrayal of the actual ""people"" and their deep spiritual desires...For example, the life of a sniper (and many other military professions) affects the lives of so many people with the trickle down affect, both while on active duty and later when attempting to reclaim their rightful place in their Spiritual walk, family and every situation the average citizen takes for granted in society..This portrayal was so very apropos to see how difficult to readjust, only to have ""society"" itself take his life...I'm certain Bradley Cooper would agree when I say that the circumstances around this one were probably very difficult for him. the actor to readjust to his regular routines after trying to remain ""in character"" while shooting this movie...THIS WAS AND IS VERY REALISTIC AND VERY WELL DONE.....",1438819200,,973,5.1257861635220126

6973350,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle, a 30-year-old Texas rancher, saw the T.V. news of the terrorists bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Sallaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya that killed eight Americans. A commendable patriotic fervor led him to enlist with the elite branch of the Navy SEALs (SEa, Air and Land). To further his resolve, while in sniper training school, he and his fiance, Taya, witnessed the news coverage of the 9/11 World Trade Center in lower Manhattan attacked by terrorist flying Boeing 767 planes into the Twin Towers. In Fallujah, Chief Chris Kyle and his team of sharp shooters provide over watch protection on rooftops of commercial buildings as the Marines on the ground advanced into the city. The snipers were on guard for Iraqi women and children that carried concealed RKG Russian grenades that are thrown at the Marine convoys. Snipers also watch for vehicles loaded with explosives speeding toward the convoys that would detonate upon impact. When these malevolent drivers were in the crosshairs, they could be incapacitated from carrying out their deleterious sneak attacks. The Marines went on a house-to-house search for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (1966-2006), crown prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. He was the highest priority target either dead or captured. Chris set a record of 160 confirmed fatal hits in his four tours of duty. He obviously saved many times that number of Marines' lives. Chris becomes the most wanted man by the Iraqis with 180,000 (currency denomination not specified) bounty placed on his head. A Syrian mercenary known as Mustafa who received an Olympic Gold Medal in competitive marksmanship sympathized with the Haji soldiers and militants funded by bin Laden. Mustafa fully intended to take out Chris and collect the reward on him. Fortunately, the couple of times Chris took a direct hit from Mustafa he was wearing a tactical Kevlar bullet proof suit; however, Biggles, best friend and fellow sniper to Chris, wasn't as lucky. It becomes a personal vendetta for Chris and the entire Team of SEALs to get Mustafa. This film, in my opinion, is a worthy tribute to an epic, legendary American hero!",1438819200,,2132,5.042492917847025
6973351,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"I returned this DVD because it was a bad copy. I also didn't like it because I couldn't respect a man who would leave his wife and kids to fend for  thensekves while he did 5 years of duty to kill people. One tour should have been enough.  I believe he actually enjoyed killing. I think he was touched in the head, not normal. IMHO he was no war hero, just a murderer. If you want to watch a war movie watch Lone Survivor instead..

6973394,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"This movie was well crafted and somewhat enjoyable to watch but way too fictionalized and schlocky in concept and storyline. It's a very ""hollywood"" movie. The crux of the action eventually evolves into the American Sniper vs. (spoiler alert) the Iraqi sniper and of course the American Sniper wins .. by making a completely improbable shot. Which of course didn't happen in real life. That part of the story, like almost all of the stories in the movie were totally made up to tugs at heartstrings. It feels like the kind of movie you'd watch in the 1940s that was practically U.S. feel good propaganda.

I enjoy these types of movies but this really disappointed.

At the theater I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see everyone in the theater stay seated and quiet during the credits rolling where they showed the real Chris Kyle's funeral. Everyone stayed through it and when it was done everyone stood up and walked out quietly like we really left a funeral. And I read that happened at every showing of the movie. It really blew me away.

I made sure to watch this again when it came on pay per view and now I bought the DVD because it is definitely one of my favorite movies every. I HIGHLY recommend it!",1438387200,,703,4.535433070866142

6973452,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"First off, I very much enjoyed the book.  The book follows Chris' life from his entry into the Navy until he finishes his career.  The book is written in parts or sections of his deployment and not one fluid storyline.  The movie attempts to follow the same layout but in a movie it appears broken and confusing.  Sections are added to the movie that were not in the book, likely to give a more storylike feeling.  I don't feel that this transfers well into a cohesive movie.  Bradley Cooper does a great job portraying Chris Kyle and all the acting in the movie is done well.  Overall if you wanted to learn the story I strongly recommend the book, but the movie is a pass",1438387200,,673,4.336

I would recommend it as an experience we should share in order to keep us from doing this again.  I wonder why Eastwood made the wife into a shrew.",1438387200,,397,3.817073170731707

His wife was strong, although I know it must have been hard for her; but her strength and love for this man are what helps her get through the tragedy.  Such a waste of a human life for this man to die at the hands of an unstable and sick individual. Seems like the best die young and the rest of us just keep hanging on.

6973697,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I love war flicks, however I believe this movie glorifies killing. I thing the director could have done more to try to make the viewer understand why the sniper was in Irak in the first place. Make the viewers ask themselves if that war was right or not based on the evidence.  I like the fact that it reflects a ""part"" of U.S culture were guns are everything. It is also interesting that it explores the area of veterans, that in a lot of cases are used and then forgotten.  The whole point of the movie was for me to try to understand if it was really necessary for a family man to abandon his family to go to fight an enemy on the other side of the world, an enemy that later was proven not to have WMDs.  However I believe that type of man would have found another risky activity because the way he was brought up.",1437696000,,818,4.132075471698113

6973721,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"After the first ten minutes of American Sniper I could think about nothing but Moby Dick, Melvilles great American novel about one mans consuming obsession that is at once an expression of American Puritanism and of the individualism and industry of those who exhibit a heroic nature that defies the confines of serving a landlocked, limiting community in favor of living the dream of the liberated, adventurous, new-world self.  At the beginning of Melville's epic, quintessentially American, novel, we hear a sermon that will frame the story and identify its central protagonist by seeming to condemn to everlasting damnation those who would follow such a course.

American Sniper offers in place of the stirring rhetoric and evangelical fervor of Melvilles fire-and-brimstone preacherwhose message shaming the rising tides of the Godless-flesh seems betrayed by the passion of its expressiona humble meditation delivered in a small country church by a pastor-shepherd who speaks conversationally and tentatively about the mystery of Gods infinite wisdom and the need for intellectual humility on the part of those who comprise His flock and wait upon His Grace. Though theres no comparison with the imaginative eloquence and resonating power of the Puritan preachers sermon that helps explain and shape Ahab's journey, the pastoral offering of the country preacher serves a similar function in helping us undrstand Chris Kyles singular and single-minded attraction to Iraq.

The message of the film's minister is lost on Mr. Kyle, Sr. and on his bored and noticeably restless son, Chris..  In its place, the head of the Kyle household drills into his two quaking sons a dogmatic, absolutist text of his own, based upon his reductive tripartite division of humanity into three types: sheep, wolves, and wolf-dogs.  It should be noted  that Kyle Sr. makes no mention of the Savior of humanity in Christian literature and theology, who is characterized in the New Testament not as a wolf dog but as the good Shepherd, and whose guidance becomes vital to the salvation of his flock, which consists of all human beings in creation, since all are equal in the eyes of God the Father. Such a mild message of peace is lost on Mr. Kyle, who stresses the importance of not merely righting every personal wrong but of finishing off the wolf who brought injury upon you, your family and friends.  Throughout ""American Sniper"" we will witness the indelible effect of the father's message upon the son, who imagines he will not be fully worthy of his father's blessings until he has ""finished off"" the last obstructive wolf dog.

By Chris 2nd and 3rd tours of Iraq, its clear that his wife, his own brother, and even some of his former comrades have become disillusioned by a heartless and pointless war.  Chris Kyles kill count and the recreation it affords his buddies, who at least can take pleasure in bragging about their companys sharpshooting celebrity, is what gives Kyles buddies some light moments in an otherwise hopeless, purposeless war.  And when Kyles best friend is shot, the assignation of America's best kill-shot to a rival sharpshooter with Olympian skills (and a suitably picturesque nick-name: The Butcher) sets up the final confrontation as certainly as Ahabs last run at the Great White. Kyles buddies have by now begun to make a game of who deserves the most credit as Chris' biggest PR agent in Iraq,  But it's never a game for Chris, who is now set up to finish off The Butcheror be finished off himself.  This personal vendetta consumes him at the expense of everything else.

When Kyle delivers the 2-mile kill shot (does any one check to verify that it hits its mark?), he gives away his regiments location, attracting much unfriendly fire.  But at this moment of personal validation, he's acts as though he's invulnerable to the exploding armaments all around him (reminding me of Robert Duvall's surfing American officer in Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"") and calls his wife, shouting that he's coming home. The quest had apparently become so personal that, by the time Chris ""finishes off"" the ""Butcher,"" the mission is complete without the dispatching of any more wolf dogs.

Throughout the film we see the indelible effect of the fathers message on the son, and the viewer is left to wonder if the end of the film is a conventional heros welcome or a problematic tribute admitting some criticism of a soldier who not only took his heroism too seriously but did so at the expense of the sheep whose internal injuries could represent no less a threat to him than the Iraqi opposition.  And how important is his showdown with The Butcher if it leads to prideful defiance of death and abandonment of the soldiers who still count on his protection?  (Ironically, in a conversation with the psychiatrist at the vets' hospital he insists that he suffers only from a regret that he didn't protect more of his men.)  At best, the hero's homecoming invites different interpretations, even apart from the death that awaits him on a shooting range.

The film may indeed be patriotic and sincere in its admiration of its protagonist, but its also more layered and complex than many viewers appear willing to allow.  A study of Eastwoods other films, which frequently deal with the search for an authentic male identity, would provide a clearer view.  But better yet, read Melville's ""Moby Dick.""",1437609600,,5402,4.986651835372636

We even enjoyed the Hurt Locker a lot more. Believe it or not, we felt the emotion was lacking in American Sniper. They don't even really address his death other than showing the actual funeral procession right before the credits.

6973818,5,B00SB9Y6KW,My wife and I had wanted to watch the movie since it came out. Finally we were able to watch it on Amazon Prime. I found it to be a great story line and Bradley Cooper did a great job portraying Chris Kyle. I appreciated what Chris went through during his 4 tours in the war zone killing the enemy. It was not really glorifying killing as much as it was about the personal trials of Chris and his family. I recommend it highly.,1437523200,,427,4.095238095238095

Overall, an entertaining movie to watch that gives those of us with a patriotic heart a graphic understanding of the tremendous sacrifice that so many are willing to give during their call to duty.  I would have given another star had some of the scenes not seemed so cheesy and ""Top-Gun""-ish.  Also, the movie kinda portrays where it seems like any poor schlub off the street can immediately go off and enlist and get selected into the Navy Seals...I don't think so.  There's a bit more to it than that...but probably works very well to get a lot of new Marines and Sailors in the door.",1437523200,,686,4.377952755905512

It gives you a better understanding of what American Soldiers go through when they serve.  Although I grew up with an immense respect for all military members, this movie heightened that respect.  I loved that this is not your typical war movie.  It follows one soldier's life, but gives you glimpses of other soldiers lives as well.  It goes back and forth between their home life and their life serving overseas and transitions beautifully.  A must watch.

I also have to say, yes, there is a fairly obvious fake baby in one scene, but if you're going to get caught up with the fact there's a fake baby, just go lock yourself in a closet and never come out.

6974019,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"What more can I say that hasn't already been said about this true American war hero. Countless lives he saved though he struggled with knowing that he could have saved even more. But there comes a time in his life when he had to get out of the fight and come home. That did not come easy for Chris and the movie showed how he struggled with knowing that he was still capable and certainly more than willing to help but he had done his part. There will never be a shortage of those who want to hurt us and people like Chris Kyle, who are genetically, emotionally and physical hard wired with a natural drive to want to protect people. It can take a lifetime and it would still not be enough. At some point, these war heroes need to stop and let some other ""sheep dog"" do their part.

He finally finds a way to continue to help and 'stay in the fight' with his work helping returning war heroes. This gives his life meaning here at state side. But we all know what happens to him as a senseless act of evil stands in the way, not only ending Chris's life, but forever scarring his family and once again, stopping him from further helping others. But even though his life has ended on this earth, he still finds a way to continue to help, being a 'sheep dog' even in his death.",1437436800,,1274,4.2

6974028,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood did an excellent job of throwing some light on an aspect of American culture that needs some reexamination.  Even though Chris Kyle was a professional in the service of the U.S. Navy, he should not have been allowed to have served four tours in combat.

Thats just too much, and its not a humane or respectful way to treat the members of our armed forces. That we, as a people continue to allow this to happen to not just Kyle, but many other service members, is almost unconscionable.

Eastwood shows that the ideals that Kyle lived for were extremely admirable, but the way he lived his life seemed to be almost self-destructive.  Eastwood shows (with some subtlety) that  Kyle didn't always consider the long term ramifications of his actions.  It didn't seem to be his style.

On one hand, Kyle used his God-given talents and skills to the best of his abilities in order to save lives from those who threatened them.  On the other hand, the family life that he seemed to want was sort of nonexistent.

American Sniper was very interesting, albeit thoroughly depressing.  Excellent film, but not entertaining.  In the end, Kyle lost everything.  He, and others like him, need to be remembered.",1437436800,,1211,4.769230769230769

6974033,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint bit off more than he could chew. There was just too much covered in the movie, and as a result it was too jumpy and not enough explanations or character development. The war scenes were phenomenal, but none of the at-home scenes were not any good--the dialogue was absurd and one-dimensional. The characters in the at-home scenes just weren't believable. And most of that just felt like it either needed to be developed more or removed. The ending credits were fantastic, but Clint didn't have much to do with producing that.",1437350400,,531,4.782608695652174

6974043,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle has been on my radar for years, and I am very appreciative of his sacrifices both overseas and helping soldiers with post-war problems.  I wish his family the best.  I generally like Clint Eastwood films.

However, this must be one of the most overrated movies.  It was incredibly slow (despite all the ""action"").  My girlfriend even fell asleep for part of it.  I'm glad I paid just $2 for it (it was on special).  As a native Texan, I can't relate to the characters.  It's overdone.  I have plenty of friends who do rodeo stuff and plenty of friends from Texas who served.  None of the characters in this film fit them.  It just seems too fake.  In reality, people don't really act like and say the things in this script.  Perhaps the casting of Cooper for Kyle was not a good choice.  Indeed, it is hard to take Cooper seriously after some of his goofy roles in other films.

It also feels like this was a 4 or 5 hour movie that was cut down to 2 hours in post production.  The scenes were short and choppy.  There wasn't enough time for any sort of character or story development.  I'm not really sure what the aim of this movie was.  The biggest theme I got out of it was ""war is bad for people.""  Yet I think they could have done a lot better if the goal was to highlight the sacrifices of our soldiers and their families.  The best parts of this film were the final pictures of his real memorial service;  it was worth sitting through two hours of bs.  I even shed a tear or two.

Overall, I was letdown.  We need war heroes, and Chris Kyle is a great war hero.  But it takes more than a patriotic theme and some guns to make a decent movie.  There are a lot better war movies out there.  I would have much rather spent my time watching a true documentary of Chris Kyle's life.

Unfortunately, I just don't think this film taught much.  Has the American public's perception and interaction with war victims changed appreciatively since this film was released?  Were we left inspired?  Did this film help expand our worldview or moral code?  Did it do anything to help correct our cultural decline?  If you ask me, it was just another mindless mix between comedy (Cooper's bulls***) and overdone Hollywood action (talking on the cell phone during firefights LOL).  This film could have and should have been so great.

It is my assumption that the American people are starving for films with good values, patriotism, pride, and meaning.  We need something that those outside of New York, LA, and San Fransisco can relate to.  From the marketing and director, this movie seems to fit the bill.  It just didn't live up to it.  I appreciate the attempt to provide a film for heartland America.  Give it another shot.",1437350400,2,2729,4.44331983805668

The juxtaposition between the life of a soldier in country, on duty, on gaurd 24/7 vs the life of a husband, father doing ordinary, gentle things was handled with a true grasp of the difficulty in making that transition. These men are expected to do incredibly difficult, dangerous work and do it with honor and courage and ferocity. Rotation home can be equally hard and fraught with invisible emotional barriers they aren't able to share. Clint Eastwood's direction here was impeccable and Bradley Cooper took my breath away.

 I commend Mrs. Kyle for letting her story be told as well here, her journey has been long and filled with love and pain, but her husband's honor is hers as well.

If you are a proud American and are interested in what some of our warriors do for their country and their fellow warriors you NEED to watch this movie. If you are not a proud American (or at least a non-American who loves and respects America) and/or have no respect for the sacrifices that our warriors make for their country and the civilized world MAYBE you will take some benefit from this movie.

6974281,5,B00SB9Y6KW,just a great read,1437004800,,17,3.5
6974282,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Before seeing the movie, I had not read the book or even heard of Chris Kyle.  I think to my own shame, like many others since 911, our lives have gone on with little thought of those serving overseas. If we have not been directly touched by family members in the armed forces who served in Iraq, we probably didn't think much about it. Sure, we watched the news, saw pictures of caskets with American flags draped over them, but didn't feel the terror these soldiers endured, the pain their families have suffered, or the sacrifices they made.

American Sniper will bring you face to face with the lives of young men who fought. The story of Chris Kyle is not just about is ability as a marksman and the kills that he made to save the lives of other soldiers. It's about the turmoil of serving, the danger, dealing with PTSD, and trying to make sense of the war when at times it made no sense at all.

Bradley Cooper's performance was phenomenal. The man really deserves an Oscar, whether he wins or not. I think that he portrayed Chris Kyle with deep respect and knew the responsibility he held to bring this man's story to the public. Great job Clint Eastwood, too, for the fine direction.

Though I have read some rather scathing reviews of Chris' book on Amazon that have painted him less than a saint in real life, I frankly have not let that taint my enjoyment of this movie. It's not just about this one Navy Seal. The movie is about the sacrifice young men make for our country, who have no qualms in joining one of the branches of the armed forces to serve. It reminds us what it means to protect the freedom we enjoy.

Great flick.",1437004800,,1642,4.3881578947368425

6974311,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I normally would not watch a movie this violent and on this subject, but it was only 99 cents today so I ignored my better instincts.  I'm sure it's an acting tour de force.  I saw numerous interviews with Bradley Cooper (why I took a risk watching it) and was intrigued by him and his experience of making the movie.  That said, I found the half I watched gruesome and boring.  I can't imagine the horror of being put into this or any battle arena and I know that soldiers sent there were doing their job.  It was't their fault that they had no business invading a country under false pretenses or that they had to defend themselves against being killed.

Maybe it was my bias against war, but I really hated everything about the half of this movie that I forced myself to endure.

That said, it troubles me that we revere someone as a hero for killing a record number of people - no matter what his motivation. I wish I hadn't wasted my 99 cents.",1436832000,,948,4.292134831460674

The controversies surrounding Chris Kyle were alluded to as they should have been and not ignored. He was not a perfect person. But his portrayal in the movie was very believable is worth five stars.

6974445,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"Kyle was an American hero.  The book told his story of how he fought against a backdrop of marital problems (no surprise,  SEALs have a 90% divorce rate).  I thought the movie would be better.  Unfortunately,  it was worse.  Oh Eastwood, technically is a great director. And it's an important story but Clint turns it into an obsession killing of  an Iraqi (actually Syrian) sniper by Kyle.  A story that isn't true according to the book and then Clint turns to Kyle's  regrets about killing again not from the book. It worked well in Unforgiven, less well in Grand Torino and doesn't work here.

Kyle killed over 300 men.  You don't need to play up shots (fictional or real) on boys.  He was doing  his job and he did it well.  Whether all were deserving of being shot under the rules of engagement, we'll never know but we know he risked his life and saved many US servicemen.  Eastwood didn't need to invent this but it's because Clint is comfortable  telling  the same story over and over.  Eastwood lacks range.

Cooper's acting is shockingly wooden.  Lots of yes ma'ams and yessirs. And fits of rage some of which were constructed for the movie to give Kyle more of emotional depth I supposed. The worst sin of all: The Chris Kyle in the movie is not the Chris Kyle in the book.",1436745600,7,1284,4.476190476190476

6974453,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I like the book better but that's normal response.  As far as the DVD goes, good quality.  There are extras about Chris Kyle, his wife, family and his background.  The storyline is based on true warrior, heroes him and all who fight for us, and it was well put together.  Kyle was murdered during the filming in real life, during the beach training scene in fact is when they got the call he was dead.  Clint Eastwood, the master at acting and directing, did well.  Bradley Cooper even did the part by adding 40 lbs of body mass to match that of Kyle.  It's worth the money to buy this and the book.  I compare what I went through in training (Army Special Forces) with his description of SEAL Training .. both were equally tough.  I hated the ending because it just leaves you hanging ... for those who see this in 5-10 years .. they may not understand the ending ..",1436659200,,867,4.302469135802469

I'm referring to the military actions and missions over the course of Chris Kyle's four tours over there.  But, from watching the Special Features interviews, I believe the movie line underwent significant alterations following Kyle's untimely death.  It's not a bad movie, but it's a movie about a marriage and the strains on a marriage that military life can impose.
And it's a love story.  And for that I believe couples will appreciate this movie a lot.",1436659200,,535,4.720430107526882

The combat and home scenes were hurried and at time confusing.  Both suffered from abrupt shifts which seemed disjointed.  Worst of all was the coverage of Kyle's death.  I never got to really understand Klye or able to empathize with him despite wanting to.  It is a strange movie.,1436572800,,553,4.29126213592233

For me the most surprising aspect was the last segment - masterfully handled.  And if you aren't overwhelmed by it, Pal, please turn in your membership in the human race  if  as soon as you can.  And your American citizenship badge, if that also applies.

6974545,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Many times, as we all know, the book is better than the movie. This situation is no different. The story of Chris Kyle and his family is one of the best tales of war that has ever been put to print, encapsulating all aspects from deployment to leave back in the states. American Sniper the book is one of my favorite literary pieces of all time. When it came to adapting that story to the big screen it was a tall task. I feel that the casting was top notch and the actors did a great job. I really like how Eastwood put his particular spin on it however for me it was missing something. The scenes in the book that were my favorites were all included in the movie (even if some of them were a bit co-mingled and rushed). Overall I do feel that the movie did its due justice to the Kyle family and the commitment that they had to the American war effort but for me, taking a little more time to craft out the details in the war scenes would have made this a 5 star review.",1436486400,,972,4.067708333333333

In one scene, a cheaply made doll is used in place of a real infant. That may seem trivial, but it ruined the entire scene. My husband and I looked at one another simultaneously as if to ask, ""Are you kidding me?"" Speaking of my husband, he was VERY excited to finally watch American Sniper and was equally disappointed.

To spotlight this man's courage and compassion and hesitancy to keep the defense as powerful and secure as possible is, perhaps a necessary evil. Evil in the sense that the Commandent ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" is as real as the day Moses brought the Tablets down from the mountain.
Oh, yes, all these pragmatic concerns, oh yes, all the people who were saved, but, when will the movie be made that shows the words of the great poet Wilford Owen: ""I am the enemy you killed, my friend,"" be released.
No matter how comfortable one can make oneself in a movie theater or car or living room and watch this drama it does nothing to but numb and dumb us down to the reality of the cessation of human life.
The sanctuaries of the womb and the church have now been blasted away and what has replaced them?

So I only got about 1/2 way through it. In any case, it is very predictable, very poor dialog and the uber-soldier portrayal is way over the top.

In that respect, this movie fired on all cylinders.  I liked the character development between the two leads, and I thought the SEAL training was accurately, if lightly, depicted.  The problem, I think, is that there was just too much story for the standard 2-hour format.  It was difficult to distinguish deployments, difficult to recognize the various characters by name or appearance and, most importantly, difficult to track the subplots when the snipers were on the ground blending in with the infantry.  However, if you own the DVD, watch it a second time, and then a third time, as this will give you a greater appreciation for Clint Eastwood's film.  Brad Cooper's work is outstanding.

Chris Kyle was a true Navy SEAL upholding all of the standards and commitment to the military and to our country.  The other side of Kyle showed a man that struggled with his kills, his family, and himself.  This movie shows the absolute horror of a useless war, waste of humanity, on both sides, as well as what Veterans go through when coming back home.  It is tragic that this man was gunned down in an attempt to help another individual with his own horrors and struggles.  For those that were never in the military, this is a must see movie that will enlighten the public to what we veterans go through to keep our country safe.",1436400000,,804,4.548611111111111

6974855,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"I was a soldier.  And a leader of soldiers.

Director Eastwood should have modeled after the  war films from 1942 to 1945, and made a classic for-all-times movie for the American people.  Instead, he sank down to the lowest possible common denominator of ""contemporary"" Hollywood standards in making this film.  The gratuitous, graphic, vulgar language is uncalled for, inappropriate, and usually adds nothing to the scene.  This film could have been (like in 1944) appropriate for all age groups, forever.  This vulgar language is used even in non-battlefield scenes, in romance scenes, in Texas scenes.  It is uncalled-for, and inappropriate.  This film degrades Chris' wife, even if it is true that they met in a bar environment.  That whole episode could have been presented with a great deal more dignity, which is what Chris' family deserves.

Even the battlefield scenes, in 1944 and 1945, did not include this kind of graphic profanity, though everybody knew that ""among the troops"" the language might have been quite different than on a movie screen or in the neighborhood bar or grocery.  With those real American community family-oriented standards, a film story like this about a true legend and hero could have been viewed by 9-year olds and 12-year olds and even 80-year old grandma in the same theater.  But not THIS film.  The graphic, sexual, vulgar language was just not necessary to the telling of this heroic story.

What a pity we don't have Jimmy Stewart around to direct a wholesome script and Henry Ford to produce and finance them.  Standards.  Public standards of decorum is what the real America had (past tense).  I honor Chris.  Eastwood is a shame.

This film is like sitting down at the dinner table to a perfect, delicious homemade organic lasagne, and someone comes up and throws sand in it and thinks you'll be okay with that.",1436140800,,1860,4.938709677419355

6974927,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"As a depiction of an actual person, I felt it was lacking. If you forget this was about someone who actually lived and experienced events similar to what was shown, and if coming from a mindset of it being nothing more than story-telling, then this was a great production.

But when I think of what it might have been like to actually have been that person, I didn't get enough of a sense of realism, rawness, pain, torment. Perhaps it's Eastwood's style, perhaps it's to cater to the American audience, perhaps I'm coming from the wrong place. I've seen enough European and Korean movies to see what it's like to see the ugliness and pain of humanity depicted, so perhaps that's it. I think I was hoping this movie focused more on his PTSD and/or what it is really like to be accountable for that many lives and to continue doing so over and over again - both sides of that idea, that is (accountable for those he murdered, accountable for those in his units murdered when he didn't ""do his job"" well enough or fast enough)... and of course all this when he knows his own life is at risk with every moment. I guess what I'm looking for is a movie that really does that.

6974964,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Very good movie but many differences from the book which was written by Chris Kyle himself.  Bradley Cooper was sensational in this role and he played the part of Chris Kyle magnificently, with the intensity and passionate you imagine Kyle to have, and his utter belief in what he was doing.  The directing and the cinematography are so well done you almost feel you are there.  I have to note, that I did read the book prior to ordering the movie and Clint Eastwood took some pretty big liberties with the story.  I love Clint Eastwood's movies and I realize that sometimes artistic license comes into play to try to make points in that narrow two hour window time for the movie which you have so much more time for explaining in detail in a book.  I get that.  And, Bradley Cooper played the part of Chris Kyle magnificently.  In fact, he seemed like exactly what I imagined Chris Kyle to be like as I read the book.  But the additions in the movie or Kyle's first kill being a child, is complete fiction.  His first kill that Kyle describes is the mother, who did have a child with her.  But clearly Clint Eastwood must have had his reasons for changing it.  The whole scene in the movie when Kyle takes his longest shot, which was a phenomenal shot, farther than his range finder could register, and so he had to use his own estimation to take it, was really portrayed well EXCEPT for the fact that he did not shoot that enemy sniper with that shot.  In the book Kyle describes the entire incident in detail and it was not the way portrayed in the movie.  Also, the scene in the movie where Kyle starts to fall apart during the firefight and he calls his wife during the gun battle, I have to say, was hard to take because Chris Kyle was so completely committed and focused on being a SEAL, being there for the men he served with, to me, that scene seemed out of character.

I really did like the movie immensely, but when a movie is portraying a real life story, not fiction, taking liberties with the story is hard to swallow.  I applaud Clint Eastwood for the movie, but I struggle with my feelings about it because of the changes from the book.",1435968000,5,2152,4.371859296482412

6974967,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood's direction is very well done. The cinematography is well executed and Bradley Cooper's performance is alright. The film had potential to be more than a by-the-numbers biopic but it never goes further. You are supposed to feel sympathy for Chris but the characterization is so poor that you never do. American Sniper is a film made for its target audience. And I imagine military aficionados will enjoy it very much. But unlike great war films like Full Metal Jacket and Apocolypse Now, it never goes deep into the psyche of the solider, and never challenges the audience to question war as a whole.

6975048,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"The Chris Kyle murder trial was a huge deal near me.  It took place roughly 40 minutes from my house, and so that is all I heard about for months.  The murder itself was a big deal, but after the movie it was like our whole area capitalized on the success of the film in order to make this trial is BIG DEAL.  Regardless of your thoughts on war itself, there is no denying that Chris Kyles story is not only a fascinating one, but a profoundly poignant one.  I will never hide my neutrality.  I hate warfare and find it to be an unnecessary means and I am NOT ok with the way that this particular war transpired and progressed, but that is no disrespect to the men and women who lay their lives on the line for something they believe in.  Granted, not all are there for the right reasons (I literally had to sit at dinner for a week on a cruise with strangers, one of which was a marine, and hear them talk about how the only reason they would want to go to war would be to kill people), but for those who are there for a just cause, I cant fault them their convictions.

Chris Kyle seems to have been there for the right reasons.

Still, American Sniper takes those best of intentions and helps us to see why war is such a disastrous means to an end.  I only wish that it had developed those themes a little tighter.

Chris Kyle was a legend.  He was known as Legend thanks to his kill count as a sniper for the US Army as a Navy SEAL.  The saying goes that there are some things you cant un-see.  My grandfather fought in World War II and spoke many times of the things he saw when he closed his eyes (one such story, of lampshades made with human skin, haunted my childhood), and so, as Kyles story is told, we can see in his eyes the things hes reliving, the things hes still seeing.  As Kyle spends his time on his tours we see his personality change, and this makes coming home all the more difficult, because these are all things he takes with him.  His reaction to his fellow soldiers after a kill says it all.  While at first hes filled with a hesitant pride (What did I just do?  I cant believe that was me.), his demeanor eventually portrays an inner self-loathing and almost guilt (What did I just do?  I cant believe that was me.).

For me, American Sniper is on the cuff of greatness, but loses sure-footing with a lack of focus.  By continually switching from Kyles time in the trenches so-to-speak to his time at home, the core of this story doesnt have time to fully develop.  That internal struggle that Kyle undergoes when hes home isn't given the due attention it deserves, and the finale loses almost all momentum as the ending gets a tacked on treatment that undercuts the impact it could have had.  Im not suggesting anything like showing the murder, because its too new, too fresh to be an appropriate thing to show, but Kyles own emotional turnaround isn't given the attention it deserved.  His shift from introverted and depressed to filled with purpose and happy was too swift.  It basically happened within the confines of a single scene, and so it felt underdeveloped.  I take that back; it didn't feel underdeveloped, it WAS underdeveloped.

This, for me, was a real shame.

While I understand the importance of the war scenes, and some of them were absolutely stellar in their technicality, they became redundant in many ways and could have been trimmed, some even excluded altogether, in order to focus more on what Kyle was going through at home.  The front end and back end of the film were in dire need of more development.  The relationship with his wife Taya was also painfully underdeveloped, and while Sienna Miller (what a comeback shes having) delivers some heartbreaking moments, she felt like a plot point to me, like a character that was exploited for her tears (notice how just about every scene shes in, save her introduction, shes crying) and dramatic effect.

The savior of this film, surprisingly, is Bradley Cooper, who delivers his most mature and defined work to date.  I am not his biggest fan, and Ive made that clear before, but here he completely derailed me.  He does so much with the underdeveloped lines in the screenplay, coloring in every single scene hes in (which is nearly every single scene) with this complete understanding of Kyles emotional development.  You feel his shifts, even when the script refuses to define them.  His eyes KILLED me.

And be forewarned: Eastwood GOES THERE with this, presenting some startling images and scenes that almost feel too far (the child killing is brutally extreme) but represent the realities of war with crushing detail.

So, in the end I admire what Eastwood was trying to do here.  He presented a story that underscores the atrocities of war without being a direct advocate against it.  Its a film that can appeal to both sides of the coin, giving those who are pro-war the stirring feeling of a united brotherhood and the passions of protecting the country we love and also giving the anti-war advocates the crushing realism that causes us to take the stance we have taken.  It isn't partial, bias or preachy (which is not what I was expecting, to be honest).  It just tells its story.

I just wish that it had told it a little deeper.",1435881600,2,5244,4.495248152059134

6975086,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"This GREAT FILM impressed me during the first 130 minutes and broke my heart in the last two... I count it as one of my most important viewings in the last years. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

As probably everybody already knows this film tells the true story of US Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, who fought with great distinction in Iraq. The film focuses on his military career, but shows also the heavy toll his extended absences from home took on his family and personal life. I will not say anything else about the story - it deserves to be discovered in its integrality, without any spoilers.

This film was of course directed by a great maestro, an impressively talented and uniquely experienced one with that, Clint Eastwood, who at 84 years of age (at the moment when ""American sniper"" was wrapped up) proved once more that he is a giant in both the literal (6'5''+) and spiritual meanings of the word. During all the 132 minutes THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE WEAK MOMENT! Every scene is exactly such as it needs to be, as long as it needs to be, when and where it needs to be, succeeds logically the previous one and leads smoothly to the next one - and that notwithstanding the fact, that the narration is NOT LINEAR! The story line is simply PERFECT in every detail, from the very first scene, which immediately nails you to your seat, according to Hitchcock's principle that you should begin a film with an earthquake and then regularly increase the tension

Following on the story, it is in the same time uplifting and realistic. When making a movie about recent American wars (Afghanistan, Iraq, Global War on Terror) it is easy to fall in one of two traps: cheering (which is rare) and moaning (sadly, the most frequent case). Clint Eastwood avoided them both. ""American Sniper"" is respectfully patriotic without giving into right-winged jingoism and brutally realistic without ever going into left-winged whining. That is really a great case of perfect navigation between Scylla and Charybdis

This film is mostly a one couple show. Bradley Cooper portrayed the main character SPLENDIDLY! Until ""American Sniper"" I managed somehow to completely miss almost all the films he played in, with the exception of this amazingly bad stinker ""Valentine's Day"", so seeing him here was for me a discovery  and it was a very, very pleasant one. I was only slightly more familiar with Sienna Miller, who plays Kyle's wife, as I saw her only in ""Layer Cake"" and ""Stardust"", in which she appeared in supporting roles  here, as the leading lady, she IMPRESSED me. This film being as much about the domestic front as about the war zone adventures, her role is a very important one  and she TOTALLY ACED IT!

There are many other actors appearing in smaller parts but I must admit that I never saw them in anything else (or if I saw them I didn't retain their names or looks). That being said, all supporting actors did very well, but their parts are much smaller than those of the two leads. This film, let's say it again, is mostly a one couple show  one man and one woman (and later also their children), standing shoulder to shoulder against anything the world can throw at them

As usual with Clint Eastwood films, this one was actually made on a budget  indeed, 58 million dollars is not so much for a Hollywood superproduction. On another hand, every single penny spend is well visible on the screen  there is NOTHING CHEAP in what we see.

You should not expect here huge battles as most of Iraq War was small engagements, but the fights were filmed VERY WELL, in the same style as in ""Blackhawk Down"" and ""Lone Survivor"". There is also a lot of fights and they are definitely not limited to sniper duels, as Chris Kyle also went sometimes up close and personal against enemy, holding a M4 carbine, rather than a long range precision rifle.

The film is very brutal and shows a lot of acts of most bestial cruelty committed by Islamic extremists, which are all inspired by true events. As unbelievable as it may seem, those atrocities are not even the worst of the things Zarqawi and his band of murderers from Al-Qaida did to Iraqi civilians (especially the Shias) as in fact Clint Eastwood decided, quite wisely, to NOT show the most extreme crimes of jihadists Still, this film is strictly for the adults  and not for the faint-hearted

The ending, always the most crucial moment in films, is absolutely heart-breaking  but in the same time surprisingly uplifting! Even if it is not used in this film, I could almost hear at that moment this quote from Bible: ""I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith"". This last page concludes the film perfectly, by saying loud and clear ""Thanks for your service"" to all the American soldiers of Wars of Civilization era and then the book closes  leaving us shocked and on the verge of tears, but also elated because we just watched something uniquely great.

I have no words strong enough to praise this film. I will keep my Blu-ray preciously and never part with it. SEE IT ABSOLUTELY!!",1435708800,,5092,4.650334075723831

6975096,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Being a female, I thought I would hate this film. Another war movie with a lot of violence. However, this movie had more depth in terms of the human toll it took on a soldier, his wife, his brother and his children. Bradley Cooper gave a great performance and was so credible in his role. His wife was equally as good. It wasn't pretty but it sure was compelling. It was ironic that he never considered himself a hero but was there to support and protect his fellow soldiers. Not a happy ending and ironic that he would be killed by someone he was trying to help.",1435622400,2,563,4.271028037383178

The audio sucked.  The story sucked.  Sure it was real and true to the fact of his feat as a sniper, but translated to a movie it sucked.  Bradley Cooper should learn what many of the great early actors who also acted on stage, they must communicate with the audience with a voice that is clear and precise.

The compassion to do his job, to protect his fellow soldiers leaves you with an emotional attachment and demand would held patriotism to in new level of commitment. A must see for anyone who believes that sacrifice is called because of love for his fellow person. Painful and heartwarming all at the same time. Total inspirational.

Few, will leave the comfort of the homeland to fight in far off places and assume the ultimate risk...their life and the love of others. American Sniper will re-awaken those of us who have been dormant too long and have failed to truly appreciate those who are willing to go into battle. Today, ISIS gets more attention than our own military. American Sniper creates an awareness of that which is required everyday from our military men and women.

6975195,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"One of the best movies - war or otherwise - I have ever seen.  Clint Eastwood as a director only keeps getting better with age.  The movie will bring the strongest person to tears, as you could see how a fellow Texan Chris Kyle had an incredible will and sense of duty which almost led him to lose his family.

The film portrays the inherent and often irreconcilable conflict between duty to one's country and the obligations to one's family.

Bradley Cooper's physical transformation from a skinny guy into a real deal Navy Seal was as good as Robert Di Nero's body changes in Raging Bull.

It should not matter what your politics are - this movie does not take sides.  Rather, it demonstrates the horrors of any war.

I have a relative who is a veteran of Iraq, and like most every other participant of this ongoing conflict, he told me how realistically and accurately the movie portrays this war.

If you didn't see it at the theater, then this is a must buy so you can watch it several times, much like Saving Private Ryan or the Band of Brothers.",1435449600,,1052,4.442708333333333

The way they don't make eye contact for long so you don't see they want to scream.  hands in the pockets so you don't see the clenched fists.  I cried a lot during ths movie.

I am somewhat familiar with the story from the book of Chris Kyle and his tragic death at the hands of a fellow vet.  Bradley Cooper played the role masterfully in probably his best performance of his career.  I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan as an actor but his movies as a director have given me even greater respect for his talent behind the camera.  This movie does an admirable job at showing the tough job that our military men go through day in and day out at protecting everything this country was founded on.  The story is well done; it is heartfelt, emotional and feels real with its action and scenery.  This is a movie that I will watch again and again.

Thanks for your service, Legend, and thanks to all your brothers in arms.

6975309,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"A very well-made movie, despite some ""I doubt it"" moments. Aptly demonstrates the stress of such a battlefield, similar to that faced in Vietnam - never knowing who was an enemy or not...  What I find doubtful: 1. My understanding of how snipers work is that since the field of view though a powerful sniper scope is so small, a sniper always has a spotter whose job it is to identify potential targets.  I may be wrong...but.  Also - I find it hard to believe that any professional or non-idiot trained with weapons would purposely point a pistol at their wife at any time, even just playing around - ESPECIALLY just playing around!  But aside from those ""I doubt it"" moments it was a powerful, moving, and well-made movie with good acting. Is Bradley Cooper from Texas? He did Texan pretty well.",1435363200,,797,4.591549295774648

As a non-militant person I had wondered how I would react to seeing this movie.  Mr. Kyle's faith, his love for his family and his total dedication to his country are/were remarkable. His skills were undeniable. I cringed a lot as I watched this movie, and, truth be told, I also cried more than I will admit to! I think that this movie was very well done. It does follow the book and it does not stint on showing the realities of war; the moral dilemmas that occur, the fear and the pain- all of it. It drives home the problems that the families of a military person have to cope it. This movie made war real, but it did it in a way that, rather than making you turn away from the screen, made you riveted to it.

I am filled with admiration for Mr. Kyle, for his military family and for his true family. This movie, and the book, were revelatory for me and made me reconsider my own beliefs and feelings about war...that's quite a lot to accomplish.",1435276800,,1054,4.265

This was due to the compression technique used which reduces the number of bits used to represent the shades for each color. Normally you don't notice this except in very light and flat scenes where a 1 or 2 bit error can really mess up the shading of the picture. I was aware of what was happening and have seen this many times in other movies, even on Blu-ray. So, if you are planning to stream this movie be aware that the sandstorm scene may not look optimal.

6975521,5,B00SB9Y6KW,Excellent movie. Bradley Cooper has proven himself as a very good actor in this movie. You become so engrossed that you forget it's Bradley Cooper and believe it's the real man. This man is more than the American Sniper he was A American Heroe. He sacrifices so much of himself for this country and for his fellow Brothers. It's  true Hearbreaker too. I feel so sad that his children are going to grow up without their father. He would have been a terrific father I bet. It's hard enough for children to grow up without a father but to know what man their father was and to have him taken from them at such a young age is so unfair.,1435104000,,632,4.266666666666667

As as an interpreted biography based on an autobiographical book, I felt that it allowed me a good atmospheric reprieve from the focus of words that is the natural strength of prose. Less precise but no less true. I also see a different side to Eastwood's craft with his use of staccato drums motif. Eastwood's interest is in characters' journeys, setting, action and transformation. His stamp is on this movie. I wonder what the public reaction would be if the character was rewritten for a Hellenic setting. How  would the story be received if written for a russian sniper in Stalingrad and carried out in this style rather than the Harris - Law duel that was ENEMY AT THE GATES?",1435017600,,756,4.5588235294117645

Bradley Cooper was great in this movie, but it's the story that is truly worth watching.  U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is a real American Hero, if you don't believe the movie just look up what medals he won during his numerous tours in Iraq.  He spent nearly a decade in war zone, protecting his fellow comrades.  I read all the negative comments about this movie and about Chris Kyle, but If you haven't been where he was then you're better off to keep your ignorant comments to yourself.",1435017600,,605,4.366071428571429

6975580,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I went into this movie already expecting it to be very good since Bradley Cooper played the leading role and the movie was directed by Clint Eastwood which in my opinion, has directed amazing movies so far. The movie follows an US Seal Sniper through his 4 Iraq tours and you see the impossible choices these men must make and how it possibly affects them and their families. Everything from having to shoot a kid with a grenade, to torture to hunting down an insurgent sniper is portrayed and it is very well done. I served 10 years in the Army and saw first hand how PTSD destroys a person and their family and this movie does a decent job of showing those effects and how everyone copes with it in their own way. This movie is one of the few that's worth rewatching over and over. It's very much worth an hour and a half of your life and at least a redbox rental.",1435017600,,866,4.254545454545455

Even then He will be so strongly opposed the Bible says He will have to kill many evil people who hate God, and don't want Jesus to rule over the world He Himself has created. I'm not sure if the war in Iraq was justified, but our servicemen have always sacrificed their lives bravely believing that our country and our government truly want other people to live in a free world. This movie reminded me that war is about killing. Being a soldier is about killing, so soldiers must always be ready to give their lives.

6975691,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"It wasn't a bad movie but as far as military movies go 'Saving Private Ryan' is the better movie.  With that being said there's a lot of back-and-forth scenes throughout the movie and it was difficult for me to see where the center of gravity held everything together until half way through.  They spent a lot of time highlighting Chris Kyle caring for other soldiers on and off the battlefield. And there wasn't much glorification in his killing streak than I would have expected, not that it was necessary.  Towards the end of the film where the 'climax' of the movie should have been was nearly non-existent and it ended sooner than I knew it did.

In the end I expected more out of it considering the hype surrounding the film since it's release.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie but It felt rushed and there never really was any depth that made me feel moved in anyway. Besides movies are never the best way to accurately depict someone's personal life or active duty in combat to begin with. As I mentioned earlier this movie leans more as a tribute than a movie. And quite frankly did a good job it! :)",1434758400,,1113,4.463054187192118

6975693,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"I read Chris Kyle's book and was dumbfounded as to how people could defend this crazy man. He clearly loved killing and had no desire to stay home and be a father and husband to his family. I had seen previews of the movie and could tell from what I seen that his character was changed. After talking to a couple of people that had watched the movie I decided to watch it in order to compare his movie character to who he potrays himself as in the book. 15 minutes in and I turn the movie off. If you like boring characters, bad acting, rednecks, pointless nudity, and cussing like a sailer then watch the movie. If you have standards don't even bother. It's junk. Hollywood is it impossible for you to make a movie without sluts?! If I want nudity or sex scences I'll go to my bedroom.",1434758400,13,786,4.246666666666667

Good movie, but not groundbreaking in plot, cinematography, etc. Bradley Cooper did well, though came across as a bit robotic, even prior to displaying symptoms of PTSD. Oh and the fake baby was a bit distracting for me. In either case - good, entertaining movie, and a small glimpse of the atrocities of war and the psychology of a sniper. As war movies/series go I enjoyed Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers much more. Better character development. As sniper movies go i think Enemy at the Gates did a better job of developing and dramatizing the long-distance stand-off between snipers and that unnerving feeling of feeling of having to constantly look over your shoulder.",1434758400,,737,4.951612903225806

Clint Eastwood did a great job as did the stars, just enough emotion and a good balance of action to keep you interested and in to it. For all of those very unpatriotic folks giving it low scores for the violence and talking about the American ""Killing Machine"" or the added drama, why did you go see it to begin with?

Chris Kyle was a man the American  people can be proud of and I have to include his wife in this because her life was not easy. Clint Eastwood did a great job as usual.

6975798,5,B00SB9Y6KW,I love the movie,1434672000,,16,3.25
6975799,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"The production and special affects of this film are first rate. I am also heartened by the fact that it was extremely popular and enjoyed enormous box office success. I think that speaks highly for Americans in support of our military.
I enjoy Bradley Cooper as a fine actor and I think he did a good job with the bland script. Although I have enjoyed Clint Eastwood as an actor for many years I do NOT think much of his directing. The combat action scenes of this movie where about as good as it gets in the movies but I could
not always understand what the characters were saying. Poor sound editing? What I did hear was flat and over simplified, especially, during the ""mission"" briefs. Except for Cooper, the other actors came off like actors reciting lines rather than believable characters that come to life (and death). The most gratifying part to me was the ending where actual footage of Americans lining the highway for Kyle's funeral procession is used. Again, this speaks highly for the American people.
I must also point out that I was offended by the near-end scene where Kyle jokingly holds a (presumed empty) pistol on his wife. It looked like a real gun, not a toy, and I can't believe Kyle, knowing so much about firearms and safety, would have actually done such a thing, especially in front of his kids.",1434672000,,1323,4.586497890295359

County, God, Family, that shocked me hearing this because that is the 3logy that, I remember my great grandparents to my grandparents,  told to me it's not by chance that those are the foundations that build a decent society with morality,  & respect.  His pain from what I understood from the movie was to protect the others through that scope. You know the Spartans lived by the code of the PATRIS- Meaning PATRIOT-FATERLAND.

6975911,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"American Sniper is an incredible movie. It's like a gut punch. The realism depicted here is so intense I got a taste of what our brave soldiers face every day in the field. War is obviously ugly and takes a huge mental and physical toll on our military men & women. Glad this movie reminds us of that. Chris Kyle is a true hero and this movie is fitting of his incredible contributions. You guys hating on this movie should understand that there is no glorification here. I get a sense of real loyality to these guys after seeing what this man's life and sacrifices was all about.. We need more support for our troops both abroad and at home. PTSD is real. Watch this movie, buy this movie. Truely an incredible and realistic effort from hollywood for once. At the end, the waterworks flowed for a great man.",1434585600,,808,4.429530201342282
6975912,5,B00SB9Y6KW,We ask our men to sacrifice everything while simultaneously treating them as criminals for prosecuting a war against brutal savages that the political class never intended to win.

6975926,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"The movie begins with the glorified and senseless killing of a wild deer and continues along and ends with senseless attempted and actual killing of human beings. Not to mention the fact that war itself was senseless. From the little we know about Clint Eastwood's politics and his 'performance' at a Republican National Convention (which can be seen on YouTube should anyone not be familiar with it) he himself has become senseless, so what little can be expected of this much glorified movie?",1434499200,5,494,4.963855421686747

S. service people riding around in these huge machines all wired up with  21st century technology and encumbered with fifty pounds of body armor fighting this barefoot Arab with an AK47 and little else.

I am also reading the book which has a lot of stuff that couldn't be put on the movie or it woulda been an XXX film. This movie does not glorify war, but rather shows the dedication of this Navy SEAL to country and family and the toll the war has taken on our armed forces and their families back home. Bradley Cooper should have received an Oscar for his performance, but the Hollywood liberal elite would not tolerate that kind of recognition. Of five nominations, American Sniper only got one Oscar....for sound editing. This package also includes a second DVD about the making of the film with great interviews with Cooper, director Clint Eastwood, and Chris Kyle's real world wife, Taya, among others.",1434499200,,822,4.523489932885906

6976010,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"People who watch this movie generally fall into 1 of 2 camps.  Fans of the movie like the fact that it extols one of the deadliest snipers in U.S. military history.  Meanwhile, critics of the movie accuse it of revising history and putting a positive spin on an ill conceived war which has gone disastrously wrong for the United States.  In this case, these views are not mutually exclusive and both camps have merits for their arguments.

That Chris Kyle is an American hero is without question.  His name is up there with Audie Murphy, Nathan Hale and George S. Patton.  Brad Cooper does a good job of capturing the mannerisms of a humble sailor who felt he was simply doing his job & nothing more.  Some will take cheap shots @ Kyle for having to shoot women & children.  I ask these Monday morning quarterbacks the following question:  what, EXACTLY did you expect him to do?  Allow the Marines he was assigned to protect get killed?  There is an old rule in military warfare (I can't remember what it's called) that goes something like this:  you can protect your men, OR you can protect civilians, but not both.

As for the Iraq war ending up as a goat-screw,  that point is beyond debate @ this juncture.  Even most Neocons have conceded as much.  It was based on faulty premises, the politicians made catastrophic mistakes (paging Dick Cheney, Dubya & Paul Wolfowitz) and there was a fundamental misunderstanding of the rift between the Sunni & Shia Muslims.  To be sure, none of this was Chris Kyle's fault, nor was it the fault of any soldier / sailor / airman or Marine.  At this point, it is what it is.

There is your backdrop.  On to the film.  It traces the life of Kyle (mostly via flashbacks) from his childhood to meeting the love of his life to his joining the Navy, becoming a SEAL and doing 4 tours in Iraq.  It is an introspective war movie that is more about Chris Kyle the man than it is about his considerable achievements.

In Greek mythology, Ajax was one of the mightiest Greek warriors who fought in the Trojan war ~ second only to Achilles.  After the war was over, he was cursed by Athena and suffered from some rather bizarre hallucinations.  Nowadays, we recognize Athena's curse as a metaphor for PTSD.  Chris Kyle is a real-life story of Ajax.  The take-away is clear:  if even a brave SEAL the caliber of Kyle can get PTSD, then it can happen to anyone.  In the 3,000+ yrs since the Trojan war, nothing has really changed.  Hopefully, this movie may compel people coming out of war zones to seek the help they need.

In the end, the most remarkable thing about Kyle is not the number of enemy kills he has (although that is mighy impressive).  Rather, it is just how HUMAN he is.  We tend to forget that ultra tough DELTA Force / Green Beret / SEAL / Marine Recon / Parajumper types enjoy spending time with their family and going to their kid's baseball games as much as the rest of us.  That, in short, is the heart of this story.  It is, in fact, why Kyle and so many others like him put everything on the line:  the compulsion to live a life of normalcy.",1434412800,,3094,4.423758865248227

6976047,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Watched America Sniper today on Amazon Prime. Not as good as I had hoped. Eastwood could't decide if he was making a movie or a 'docudrama'. A movie would have been better - Bradley was good in the role but the script was run-of-the-mill, and generic so there were few good lines or dialogue. The trips back to the states between tours of duty just drained out any sense of the real climactic event, which was the 'mile long shot' where he took out the legendary 'Mustafa' (that guy's character should have been exploited, the movie did not capture his fame/mystique almost at all). Some of the street fighting was pretty good but none of really got me on the edge of my seat. It cannot bear comparison with a movie like Black Hawk Down. Don't get me wrong - film should have been made, just better. Legendary funeral procession was touching - movie kept my attention but will not own it.",1434412800,,888,4.487654320987654

This is not a 'feel good' movie, as it depicts war as it exists today in a place I don't feel we should be involved.  However, I think it fairly accurately depicts what our military was experiencing, both while there and when they got home.

The movie is well done and tells a compelling story of one fine soldier's life and death, but I cannot give 5 stars that depicts so much death.

6976203,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle's account of his four deployments in Iraq, mostly as sniper, comes across of a man hugely enjoying his job. He says so himself, and in so doing presents the point of view of the fighter on the front contemptuous of the command above. Some of them, not all. In his opinion, too many battles were lost because of overcautiousness, while he would have pitched into them without qualms.

Kyle's marriage to Taya is always being put on the back burner, through one child, then another, while he is away on the front. She is understandably resentful of his absences, more so that he enjoys his deployments so much. His closeness to his buddies is what makes them a good fighting unit, but with that comes terrible grief at the deaths of some.

He mentions more acronyms than I can maneuver around, but one, the Polish GROM, earned high praise. The marines, too, come through for him. One point he makes applies even today, that the soldiers of Iraq feel loyalty only to their own tribes, not the country of Iraq, and their performance in battle all too often reflects this, shall we say, lack of commitment.

Taya makes her own entries in the book, and they are what every abandoned wife would say and feel. Resentment as he takes off each time and deathly fear of losing him. And each time he returns Kyle finds himself the outsider.

Kyle helped found FITCO, an organization providing at-home fitness equipment for emotionally and physically wounded vets. His murder at the age of 39 by another vet presents a terrible consequence of war.

The last, poignant pages written by Taya belong indelibly with Chris Kyle's story.",1434326400,,1629,4.701754385964913

6976243,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I enjoyed this book a lot.  Enjoy is a bad word to describe what he was expected to do and was exposed to.  To call him a hero is an understatement.  Four combat tours is clearly above and beyond the call of duty.  Add to that the close combat he was involved in and the nature of being a sniper, he is a better man than most of us.  He was gone for the early years of his children and marriage.  How much more can we ask of a man.  To come home at long last and become involved with the care of vets with PTSD Shows just what a remarkable person he was.  To die while helping an fellow soldier makes this story an American tragedy.  This is a book that should be read by all.",1434240000,,676,3.875912408759124

The dialog and even the way the story was told and filmed smacked of Hollywood overkill in an attempt to drive people to the box office.  For a true story being told (from a single individual's viewpoint) it didn't feel authentic... since I didn't read his book I can't tell if it was due to his story telling or that of Hollywood's strive for the blockbuster homerun hit.  Lots of heroes in that war and most of them died but few celebrated individuals lived to tell about it and for that this movie deserves its stars but for the execution of the merits of the movie storytelling... meh, I felt it was just so-so.",1434240000,,659,4.341463414634147

6976341,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"The film by Clint Eastwood is arguably better than the book for the simple reason that Eastwood has injected into the story a little humanity that seems to be disturbingly absent in the book. What makes this film valuable is the controversy it should inspire. Eastwood adds little touches that make us question the sanity of whats going on. Should Kyle have telephoned his wife in the middle of a firefight? Did he have any notion of how traumatizing that might have been for her? Did his training eliminate the option of simply wounding the little boy carrying the rocket instead of killing him? Should Kyle be regarded as an American hero? What does that say about us? In the book as well as the film, there's no doubt Kyle's motives for national defense are sincere. But how far can we go before we discover we're no different than those who would happily embrace our total destruction? Eastwood makes us confront these issues. I highly recommend this film.",1434153600,,960,4.720238095238095

It seems that the illness of schizophrenia is often connected to tragedies associated with people attempting to do good. Not all people with schizophrenia harm others in this way and I don't wish to believe there is a connection between wounded egos and mental illness but I do want to understand the why of such tragedies so we can prevent them from happening.",1434153600,,560,4.783505154639175

6976381,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Have many mixed feelings about this movie. Of course, anything Clint Eastwood does is always first rate, it's mostly in the telling of the story. He did a good job or relating the home life side and the warring side. I think this would have been best served as an HBO series of similar. Much more could have been explored in more detail and given a more accurate portrayal. The realism was certainly there but too little was given to the important characters, not only Cris Kyle. Then, as I understand it from doing some online research, the original ending was going to be what eventually happened at the gun range but was deleted for obvious reason. Once again being in favor of this kind of drama in a well done series. That said, I still give it five stars and recommend it to the unsquemish.",1434067200,,796,4.458904109589041

Why because the director Clint Eastwood dares to tell the Truth about ate government. Politics has no business in the academy...Shame on all of you, not to give serious credit for an excellent movie and a heart wrenching true story.and YOU know it. Look at the MILLONS of box office sales compared to any of the other movies! They did not even come close to American Sniper. And you gave it to Birdman.....pathetic.

I felt it was done with the utmost taste and the movie didn't blow things out of proportion. Maybe if they had, the awards would have gone differently. Thank you Clint Eastwood,  for enlightening us all to how a soldier must live his/her life, but when home,  always trying to live as a civilian with their family. As a Mother of a soldier with deployments under his belt, thank you. It isn't the career of an Officer's life that I would have chosen for my son, but he is proud to be an American Soldier, as I also, as his Mother. I hope the great actors/producers remain bringing real life careers to the screen for all to see how the other lives and survives.  Thank you.",1433894400,,771,4.303448275862069

6976507,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"While American Sniper is an entertaining movie, I don't think it's as thought-provoking as I'd like it to be.  This seems like a wasted opportunity to me.  Instead of an interesting character study, we instead get what is mostly an action movie, with some hammy drama thrown in.  Chris Kyle always felt in the right even when he was clearly wrong.  He seemed a nearly flawless man, when in actuality he was quite flawed.  He's a proven liar, and slanderer, yet the film portrays Kyle as some kind of flawless American Hero.  At no point in the story did I feel the tension Eastwood was trying to invoke.  The situation with his wife, and child, are clearly meant to be stressed, nigh on the breaking point, but it never felt like the weight was there to back up the performances.  Everything felt so safe, and not at all stressful.  It's shot beautifully, and there are some interesting visual choices.  One example: a sandstorm where we can see just as little as the soldiers can.  Little touches like this make American Sniper at least enjoyable for one watch, but repeat viewing is unnecessary.  If you can get past the glaring omission of some of Kyle's less-desirable character traits, you'll most likely enjoy the film.",1433894400,,1225,4.699530516431925

I think everyone who does not have any connection to a military person needs to see this movie to understand what our brave soldiers see and go through while protecting and serving our country.

It's too bad that Hollywood can't be true to books that are written on the subject. This story is too good to be ""interpreted"" by some Hollywood director. It isn't necessary for this story.

If I were to sum it up in a few sentences, I would say this movie is a midly dramatic tale of a veteran who tries to deal with his emotions while refusing to admit that he's even struggling, broken by sequences of war porn. Granted, I'm all about war porn, hence the five stars. I think a lot of people will struggle with this movie because there are two separate stories being told - Chris Kyle the sniper, warrior, ardent patriot fighting the good fight against terrorists who threatened our homeland on the one hand, and on the other hand, Chris Kyle the emotionally and spiritually wounded veteran struggling to come to terms with the horrors of war while being the man he believes he should be.

You could see Chris and how seriously he took his job and how he really felt in difficult situations when it came to hitting a target of women or a child. That must be very difficult for our troops. I had to admire his wife and her patience with Chis. It had to be hard on her & their marriage. We often times don't think about how the spouses or family members of our troops hold down the fort when their loved one goes on tour. We need to keep them in our thoughts and prayers too.

Chris Kyle clearly had a god complex, and even if he told himself he was just ""protecting Marines"", he clearly enjoyed what he was doing.  And it'd be one thing if we went to war with countries that pose a direct threat to us.  But that hasn't happened for a LONG time.  Like since WWII.  Now we go to war for political reasons, and disguise it as ""defending freedom"" when in reality we are the terrorists provoking other's.  Why don't we leave them alone, and when they come over on our soil and attack us then we hit them with everything we got?  And in the mean time, let's not praise those who love to kill because they're basically a redneck who needs a cheap thrill.",1433808000,4,981,4.316939890710382

6976758,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Ordered this while my teen aged nieces and nephews were visiting for a week.  They thought they wouldn't like it because it was just ""War stuff"".  Their interest was piqued when they discovered it was about RECENT events involving real people.  They were predictably a bit disturbed by the realistic depictions of the face of evil in the film, but they found themselves in TOTAL EMPATHY with the decisions that Chris Kyle had to make.  There were four young visitors watching along with me and they understood quickly what all the fuss was about.  I observed four sets of young eyes as they welled up with tears.  The language in the film is rough, but it is the honest language spoken by soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.  The film would have little credibility without it.  I explained to them that they were 'only words'...I called it, ""Military Language"" and they accepted that.",1433721600,,887,4.7894736842105265

6976781,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood cuts right to the heart of what makes people tick in this story. Much of the material has been covered before, but the acting, script, direction, photography and editing combine to create a taught story that cuts right to the truth of wars, the men who fight them, and the people they love and who love them. This is the story of a man with the perfect skillset and human character to perform heroically, both in the battle of war and the battle that vets face upon returning home and re-acclimation to civilian life, set against a backdrop of lesser men, and highlighting what it is that makes the difference. Regardless of your view of the Iraq war, and mine is extremely negative, this movie portrays a man to be admired for the purity of his convictions, driven by love for his country and compassion for his fellow man - never by hate or prejudice for his adversary. It's a rare film that can be both disturbing and uplifting - and this film delivers both.",1433721600,,976,4.519774011299435

I didn't find it glorified war at all, nor did I see what some of the criticisms were, either. Bradley Cooper did a great job portraying Chris Kyle. Having never met this American hero, I felt as though Cooper's work gave me a bit of insight into Mr. Kyle as a person and the struggles he faced, especially those trying to balance his obligations as a soldier and as a husband and father.

Depends who is on the wrong end of the rifle. I think the movie portrayal of Chris Kyle's multiple re-enlistments, and the toll it took on his family,  himself is reminiscent of Captain Ahab - he was determined to get the opposing sniper. This aspect of the story is largely fictional!!

The way they re-created the story could have been much more fleshed out with better set design and acting, but in this production the supporting cast added little if nothing to enhance this biography.  While this movie has seen ""rave"" reviews, it doesn't hold a candle to the production quality of titles such as Black Hawk Down or We Were Soldiers and I believe that Clint Eastwood is over hyped for most of his work other than a few gems like Flags of Our Fathers or Letters to Iwo Jima.

6977074,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I like Cooper as an actor, in general, but will admit I had reservations going into this, b/c I had a hard time just thinking of him playing the role of Soldier. However, I stand COMPLETELY CORRECTED,  b/c he ROCKED THE PART & WAS PHENOMENAL, STELLER, & PREEMINENT,  yet NOT over-the-top so that he overshadowed the supporting cast. This movie made me EVEN PROUDER to be an American, which only led me to become MORE DISGUSTED & PISSED-OFF @ our pussy-a@# President for, essentially, belittling ALL THAT OUR BRAVE MEN, WOMEN, & THEIR FAMILIES SACRIFICED FOR US,  HERE @ HOME. I'm thrilled & grateful that this movie was MADE, just as I am immensely grateful, honored, & respectful of each & every Soldier, & their families for their service. I PRAY we(Society as a whole) can get PAST Obama & his American hating DUMBA#@ES' THINKING & REMEMBER & RESPECT just HOW GREAT our Nation is, was, & WILL BE even moreso once these Communists are out of office. It's NOT a ""fluke"" that immigrants FLOCK to our borders, or kids(and adults alike) DREAM  of coming here. For those who DON'T LIKE IT HERE..I INVITE YOU ALL TO PLEASE MAKE USE OF OUR ""OPEN BORDERS"" & GET THE HELL OUT!

But:
Whether the war was right or not, the country/congress/people wanted it and to expect a good ole boy from Texas to know that we had been misinformed is naive and nuts. This man went through things that you can never understand and came out of it and wanted to help others.

The question should be how many lives did Chris Kyle save. No one will ever know. But surely hundreds if not thousands of lives were saved at his hand in the war.

So when I started watching the movie I was instantly disappointed. I don't understand why they killed the boy, the woman would have been dramatic enough. Then the acting? What happened? How did this acting get passed as ok? Bradley Cooper does a great job but almost every single other actor is just terrible. The Seal training? Disappointing. Maybe they thought it was unnecessary to spend more time on Seal training. I was hoping to see some clips of ""Hell week."" I guess I'll watch a documentary to get an idea.  I think that it wos have been an important addition for people who don't know or read the book. Plus I think it does the Seals an honor to show how hard they must work to become what they are.

Oh come on! The baby! The baby doll was awesome! I got to actually laugh in the movie! Then back to realities of wartime.",1433462400,4,1040,4.269035532994923

6977130,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwood changed from a very average actor (Dirty Harry, etc.) to one of the finest directors in the late 20th century into the 21st.  His choices of screenplays have been excellent, with Unforgiven, Grand Torino, and Million Dollar Baby as prime examples.  His excellent directorial skills have been demonstrated in these films and are largely unmatched in this particular era.  American Sniper is a movie about PTSD, and the screenplay seems to portray the central character, Kyle, in an almost one dimensional manner.  The movie is very predictable, and the character of Kyle never grows out of this stereotype Texas religious patriot.  He is the same at the start and at the end of the film.  Not too interesting, overall.  Very predictable war scenes, with some gratuitous violence, contrasted with his difficulties re-adjusting to peacetime life, which is something that all veterans who saw active duty have had to go through.  One needs to just walk through any VA hospital, and the stories you will hear from the men and women who served will be far more interesting than this film.",1433462400,5,1097,4.989010989010989

When anyone has a weapon in his position is a combatant that includes women and children.  I believe anyone carrying a weapon regardless of age or gender is any man's equal in killing.

6977183,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It's a great book and Chris's story should be told. I love military movies, and I love true stories. Please know I'm strictly rating it based on the quality of the movie itself, and not the story, which are two entirely different things. Movies are obviously a different medium than books, and translating a biography to the big screen can be difficult.

The reason I gave this two stars is it felt like I was watching a made for TV movie. Generally when you a movie comes from the big screen, you expect big screen quality. And that is what I was hoping for Chris's story to get. Unfortunately he didn't. The dialogue and interaction between the characters was so poor at times it distracted from the story itself. I know it's already been said, but using a blatantly obvious baby doll is not really setting the bar high or striving for excellence. Shouldn't excellence be the goal when trying to honor someone's story?

I know not every war movie can be a Saving Private Ryan, Patton, or what have you. But shouldn't that type of excellence be the goal when honoring our military personnel? Unfortunately it would appear that Clint Eastwood does not have such standards or care for detail.

Again, this is not a review on Chris Kyle's story. Just a critiquing wishing it had been developed better for the big screen to honor him more adequately.",1433376000,,1398,4.629032258064516

You see real men -- warts and all -- who bravely fight evil wherever it threatens to overpower good. Chris Kyle wasn't a vindictive or hateful man.

I salute all of our service men and women of our nation. Four consecutive tours is not any piece of cake. For those who complain most particularly universities and colleges my question to you is simple: who do you support? ISIS who are the worst criminals on earth beheading inocent human beings and committing the worse atrocities beyond imagination and using children for their barbaric ""holy war"" or should the universities and colleges be supporting our troops. Point one of their snipers who is a saint? With all due respect you have stomped on our 1st ammendment and should feel shame of each and everyone of you. When time comes you can be positively certain that I strongly will select the University and/or College where my children should attend.

6977349,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"A really good personal movie can make you feel like maybe you should not be viewing someone else's life so closely.  This is that kind of movie.  I was almost embarrassed to witness such personal moments.  This kind of movie-viewing experience is only possible when you have a performer who has crossed the line into being the sum total of the character and when that performance is made even more believable by supporting cast members who have bought into not so much their own character and acting but into the primary character.  This is the level of acting that was demonstrated in this movie that other movies hope to be.  Oh, and did I mention that it generates a discussion on war:  brutality of it, senselessness of it, necessity of it, etc.  without finger-wagging?  You know it's a great film not because it takes a side but because it shows you all sides.  It also doesn't hurt that the camera really likes Bradley Cooper.

Of course a sniper is going to kill people -- soldier do that.  But this was more about a person than a war movie.  It makes one understand the horror of having to chose killing a 10 year old child or a young woman ... with an RPG aimed at US Troops ... or letting the RPG go.  Yes it is horrible to kill a child.  And worse to let dozens of troops die.

It made Kyle look narcissistic and proud to be killing people rather than staying home with his kids. The scene where he met his wife was so so soo cheesy it made me uncomfortable.",1433203200,,517,4.630434782608695

6977509,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"No star. I am a conservative Christian and my wife and I have long wanted to see this movie and support his family and other like minded believers. I tire of the endless dribble of liberals. But, having rented this video, we found immediately we had to turn it off. The language is horrific. I think the f bomb was the fourth word used, and it just continued from there. What's worse, is the use of the G bomb and the J bomb. God says he will hold an account for those who take his name in vain, he will hold no one guiltless who does so. We are not some ultra Christian believers who can't be in the presence of cussing. But I will not invite someone to come into my home and curse my God. We knew it would be violent, and also have cussing. Maybe His name used. We should have followed our conscience. We turned it off about ten minutes into it. By then, I'm sure we had heard the f-bomb use probably twenty-five times or more.
  Movies today can still be made without the filth. Hollywood, unfortunately will not do so. And what's sad, is so many Christians buy the stuff and fill the theatres. As I said before, I am some anti-social person. I've worked in the construction trade for almost thirty years have and heard it all. I've mashed my fingers a few times and used a few words. I'm not per say shocked by poor langauge. But I am offended when God's name is derided.
  God is not shocked by filthy language. Nor is He shocked by the violence in the movies  I do know that it grieves Him and He says we are to not let any course language proceed from our mouths. But what does bring about His wrath is His name used as a cuss word. For all the family minded folk out there, I would say, do not buy this movie. I'll take a John Wayne (though he did use some language in his later movies) or a Gary Cooper film any day.",1433116800,2,1825,4.129577464788732
6977510,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"This was a disappointing film. It's full of the usual modern day ""Super Patriot"" cliches and stereotypes. Of course, every Muslim and/or Middle-Eastern subject in the film had some evil sinister trait, including the real bad boy named ""The Butcher"". All of this was so predictable including the phones going off at the wedding (just like the did in ""Navy Seals"" starring Charlie Sheen etc.). It was as though Clint took some key parts from Navy Seals, The Hurt Locker ( a far superior movie), and The Kingdom (probably the most balanced non-Fox news type movie regarding the subject), and pieced it together with Mr. Cooper.

Nobody in their right mind would doubt that the men and women of our armed forces have, and are, going through extreme sacrifice in the Middle-East. However, we do not need another arm chair warrior propaganda piece to stir up the masses with half-truths and supposed innocence.",1433116800,4,904,4.908496732026144

I found it hard to follow......one minute he's in a fire fight or doing his sniper thing and the next scene he's in his living room at home. I seemed very disjointed and confusing. Guess I was expecting a smooth plot line but instead it didn't play out that way. Nothing against Kyle but not one of Eastwood's greatest efforts....for sure. I'm glad I rented and didn't buy.

6977557,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"Insulting action scenes, insanely bad portrayal of American servicemen in action, flat characters, and enough cliche to last a lifetime. Clint Eastwood has always been a favorite of mine, but for this I say ""Shame on you Clint!""

I wanted to love this movie, I truly did! But It is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. SOOOO much is wrong with it: from the navy SEAL portion making it look like all you have to do to become a SEAL is scissor kicks while someone gently mists you with a hose, to the ridiculously inaccurate shooting scenes. I believe this movie only made money because of the subject matter and the simple fact that people were too scared to say anything bad about it.

Bradley Cooper does a very good job with this role and it is a bit different than what you'll normally see him in. I'm glad I watched it. I mistakenly though it may focus more on being a sniper or tactics and his experience in the field. I expected a bit more focus on the patriotism and Seal team aspect likely due to watching all of the documentaries on the general subject. Instead this film focuses, more than expected, on his personal story. In some ways this film could have been an hour longer and delved into some of the more team or tactical aspects a bit further and I think the audience interested in this subject would have appreciated it.

 It gives an abbreviated recount of Kyle's time serving our country, but a damn good one!

 If you want, and I suggest you should, get the full picture of his time ""In country"" and the struggles back at home, then I strongly suggest that you buy his book of the same name, ""American Sniper"".

 It goes farther than the motion picture could possibly have time to tell the entire story!  That being said, this film does a great job of capturing the emotion that you'd feel from the book and brings some of the recounts to life in a harrowing fashion!",1433030400,,821,4.3841059602649

The movie dropped the side of KYle skipping any education, or PTSD from the war.  His qualifications for ""helping"" wounded veterans by shooting guns - an obvious NRA plug.

6977767,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"What can I add that hasn't already been written about this movie?  Probably nothing.  So my comments are directed toward those who object to this movie being seen on college campuses or other such places.  I say, everyone needs to see this movie - to know how unpleasant war is and what confronts the men, women, and children who are in the path of destruction and what they are forced to do to survive.  Unpleasant to view, yes, but if we somehow get involved in war, everyone must know that it is going to be an insane situation.  This movie is just a reminder
of our situation in the world - like it or not.",1433030400,,610,4.269565217391304

6977786,4,B00SB9Y6KW,The story itself was very well put together but could of used more detail in certain areas. The end needed more elaboration.,1433030400,,124,4.681818181818182
6977787,5,B00SB9Y6KW,We saw a man struggle with his choice to sacrifice the American Dream. He ultimately became a product of his environment and had to cope with it in his natural free born life with his family. The truth that he was able to survive being targeted by his enemy in the midst of them only to be killed on his own peaceful land by the hand of someone he was actually trying to help is baffling! War is terrible.. It effects so many. The movie helps the viewer relate to the difficulty of the U.S. soldiers lives and what freedoms we have been given because of the sacrificial gifts these men and women have have given us.,1433030400,,615,4.264957264957265

6977790,5,B00SB9Y6KW,Enjoyed it,1433030400,,10,4.5
6977791,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Chris Kyle's story needed telling, but I was very disappointed in the way that it was told. I am surprised that a director like Clint Eastwood allowed such sloppy military authenticity (or lack of it) to permeate the film. It looked like Chris and his comrades were living in an athletic dorm rather than the austere primitive conditions that they certainly had to cope with. Soldiers bunched up in streets like penguins, with no tactical discipline, and most ridiculous of all, Kyle's frequent cell phone conversations with his wife during combat, sobbing to her that he wanted to come home. Such an absurdity ruined the story for me, and what will his son think one day when he sees his dad portrayed in such a manner.  Once again, a war movie that fails to capture the tone and taste of combat, doing an injustice to those who participate. A great story, but poorly told.",1433030400,10,874,4.675324675324675

6977796,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"Being ex-military and ex-military family I am a little bias.  I think the movie was well done, well written and well directed.  I also appreciated the fact not only did it bring out the mental stress on the combat veteran, it also showed what their family goes through also.  It was also to see a movie that focused on the story and not the blood and gore.  So many war movies focus bloody special effects to try and sell the movie.",1433030400,,432,4.296296296296297

I cannot imagine what horrific thoughts could have been going through the minds of either of these people, but the manner in which the real issues of returning home from battle, or returning to battle seemed very real to me.

6977807,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"I liked this movie but it wasn't as heart wrenching as I anticipated. It portrays Kyle and his wife as tough, committed individuals to military cause and marriage. It isn't a touchy-feely movie. It demonstrates the commitment and sacrifice of American soldiers and the complete disregard for life (their own or others) of Middle East Muslim radicals. We Americans have such a non-threatened lifestyle that many can't grasp the reality and harshness in non-christian countries in this world. To kill or torture you, me or one of their own....even their own children....brings no remorse...its a savagery that I can only compare to ancient times.",1433030400,,644,5.201923076923077

6977830,5,B00SB9Y6KW,The humor in the beginning keeps you enthusiastically watching even though you can sense the dramatic ending brewing.

6977831,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I am stunned, and yet not really surprised, that Hollywood chose to ignore this magnificent film.  It details what our brave military goes through from their training, to their personal lives, to their dedication to protecting our liberty, to their angst at having to shoot people, even a young person or a woman because they have a rocket propelled grenade and who are going to use it to kill our soldiers.  Bradley Cooper was outstanding in his portrayal of Chris Kyle, and his perplex life.  Kyle's dedication to be the ""sheepdog"" and not a ""wolf"" or ""sheep"" comes through loud and clear.  People that have no concept of what military life entails, and that have the stance that we should never go to war, for any reason, will probably have problems with the reality of this film.  The military is all that stands between us and those that mean to do us harm.  Thank you to all of our military that is willing to stand as the protectors for me and my family.",1433030400,,961,4.526011560693641

6977873,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"I read a book about another great, perhaps the truly greatest American war hero sniper ever and the book was amazing in its detail of a Mr. Hathcock I believe was his name and how he crawled along in the jungle in Vietnam and took out key enemy combatants.  So when I heard about this movie I was anxious to see it but due to my read of the aforementioned book this movie was not at all what I was expecting.  I would imagine there is enormous stress with any sniper actually getting into position without being seen and than lying in wait for his target.  I would think this is the key element of being a sniper.  This movie told a different story from a different perspective and please know my review takes nothing away from this latest true American hero - God bless his soul.  He signed up for how many additional tours of duty?  To protect his fellow American soldiers.  American involvement in war will not end until we reinstate the draft where everyone's son and daughter has to go then and only then will our politicians think twice before committing our boys and girls to overseas engagements where loss of American life is guaranteed as is a non-win scenario that breeds further hatred for America and Americans.

6977887,3,B00SB9Y6KW,Good movie and solid characters but wasn't that great.  It was one of the better movies that came out of the Iraqi war but Hollywood kind of ruined it.  The fake sniper story line was a little weak.  Also they kind of glossed over the the section of vets helping each other which in my mind was an important part of the aftermath.  Great movie to watch overall and makes you proud of the men and women who serve.,1432944000,,412,4.177215189873418

Some of the scenes were kind of over done (like wife on phone while he's under attack, not once but twice). Anyhow, it wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't anything special.

I think everyone that sits back and enjoys living in a country as great as our's, should see this film and realize, it didn't become ""great"" w/o the sacrifice of a lot of men such as, Chris Kyle!  My blessings and wishes for comfort go out to his family, especially his wife and children!  It's one of Bradley Cooper's finest pieces of work and I think definitely Oscar worthy!  Chris didn't seem to be a man that was all that comfortable w/praise, but, deserving of it, he truly was!  The tragic irony is that he left us at the hands of one of his own, one of the many, many, he fought so hard to protect!  Bless you, Chris Kyle, you are to be respected and honored!

The anguish that MR Kyle experience while over in Iraq. The scene when Taya was speaking to Chris  when all heck broke loose and the terror she experience not knowing if her husband was alive was one of the most powerful scenes in the movie made you feel for this brave lady. The tension displayed when he had a child in his sites that was holding an RP launcher and was thinking about firing it at a squad of soldiers. The adjustment to civilian life when he came home for good. He decision to help others cope with their nightmares and he sad demise. The heck with ""Rambo"" give me Chris Kyle any day.",1432944000,,738,4.271428571428571
6978188,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Good story about American war hero, Chris Kyle.  Chris fought the brave & honorable fight in Iraq on each of his four deployments, only to return home to battle a wife who threatens to leave him.  Five stars to Mr. Kyle- may he rest in peace.  Four stars to Clint Eastwood.  In my opinion, Clint Eastwood has redeemed himself just a little with this movie since irreverently revising Flags of our Fathers (a great book about those who fought on Iwo Jima) and reducing this great historical narrative to a CNN-like ""teachable moment."" Eastwood dishonorably morphed Flags of Our Fathers into his personal political project aimed against the post 9-11 Bush Administration. To Eastwood's credit in American Sniper, he attempts to humanize the opposing Iraqi sniper who dogs Kyle and his comrades throughout the movie.  Eastwood carefully drops hints that this faceless Iraqi assassin deserves sympathy because he is a family man too, and had a life before the war. Humanizing the enemy rounds out the character.  So think of the story now as the hunter being hunted.  Read the novel, Enemy at the Gates, or watch the movie and see what I mean.
Clint, keep making movies that are true to their story and leave your political statements at the door of the Democratic Convention. Other than that, how about bringing back Dirty Harry?",1432944000,,1326,4.866666666666666

It is, however, very well directed with wonderful performances coming from all the actors; but the action sequences, and there are many of them, left me numb. Chris Kyle has become an American hero -- and this is his sympathetically produced cinema tribute. The Middle East conflicts go on and on nonetheless, and many of our veteran heroes come home to poor or non-existent psychological and/or medical care. The subject, for me at least, is too depressing to contemplate. Kyle himself was murdered by a veteran with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",1432944000,,599,5.0

6978257,2,B00SB9Y6KW,"Icky, icky.  That's the feeling.  No, ""American Sniper"" is not an icky film, although how it was nominated for an Oscar is rather bewildering.  This is a should-watch movie, as opposed to a must-watch movie, if only to fulfill a periodic need of movie buffs to audit a class in cinematic missed opportunities, and the semi-Greek tragedy of a movie icon's obviously noble effort washing away in a tsunami of soggy cliches and equally soggy platitudes.  Ostensibly a portrait of the short but starkly eventful life of Chris Kyle, the title character given a virtuoso turn by Bradley Cooper and helmed by the ole' High Plains Drifter himself, this film brings a load of anticipation to the plate, only to ground out meekly to short.  The ickiness is not one of disappointment alone, but something a little deeper.
Clint Eastwood the director, as opposed to the laconic Mt. Rushmore-faced actor whose lore precedes him, has always been old style studio solid, if never spectacular.  He knows how to set up a scene, lock it down and let his actors flow.  His longtime production crew, including editor Joel Cox and now-cinematographer Tom Stern deliver the goods with (pardon the pun) military precision.  But as with so many Eastwood films that bark more than they bite, ""American Sniper"" falls with a thud into the coulda-been-a-contender status.  While his movies always smack of craftsmanship, they rarely deliver the combination of moxie, artistry and depth that delineate the good from the great.  He clings to his limited range, even though he has the wherewithal to extend beyond it, ala ""Gran Torino"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"".  This film is of course, not in their class, due primarily to Eastwood's other directorial shortcoming, a stunning inability to come up with a decent script on far too many occasions.  (""Mystic River"" being an exception to that, but flawed in other ways)  Jason Hall's script is predictable at best, laughable at worst.  Armed with a story that cries out for big screen explication, Hall instead delivers cliche after cliche, and drops unintended mirth bombs, like a boom mike showing up on camera.  The scene where Cooper is called into the living room by his saucy-turned-teary-military-wife-out of central casting (a solid high wire sans net performance by Sienna Miller) to gaze with steely eyed determination at the horrifically familiar televised site of the Twin Towers going down, is followed immediately (in a backwards homage to the scene in ""The Deer Hunter"" fading from the wedding to Vietnam) by Cooper deployed in the low plained desert of Iraq, is the worst, but not the only example.  Cooper's subtle and emotionally rangy performance is so undermined by this type of clunkiness that one can almost see him breaking the fourth wall and asking the viewers, ""Were those really the Republican Guards flying those airliners into the Towers???!!!""  The creation of the cartoonishly evil ""Butcher"" character is not only dumb, but borderline racist in its dumbness.  Search if you will oh patient viewer, but you are as likely to find a real flesh and blood Iraqi character in this film, as you are WMDs in the wasteland that is now Iraq.
Beyond that the film's larger problem lies not, as many progressive critics have stated, in being a homage to this most unnecessary war, because that is too shortsighted a view.  The larger problem is the missed opportunity to build on the quatro-deployed Cooper's symbolism as a flawed yet finely tuned soldier, whose focus is eroding with time.  Cooper's performance is central to the film and he carries the flag with aplomb.  His performance is larger than the small minded canvas Eastwood gives him to work with, and well worth watching.  Finally, the failure to deal with the beyond ironic and awful story of Kyle's death at the hands of a fellow PTSD soldier is glaring in its absence as well.
""American Sniper"" is not as bad as its most vociferous critics contend, but it is certainly not good.  But maybe, just maybe, the loner/iconoclast at the heart of Clint Eastwood is telling us something in a most backward, and truly icky manner.
One can only hope.",1432944000,2,4144,4.930935251798561

Considering that it was such a popular movie, I'm sure there were many young people that watched the movie and the language was totally inappropriate for them.",1432944000,,452,4.555555555555555

The DVD is a 2-disk set, one with the movie and the other with extra features such as interviews with the actors, director and Taya Kyle, the wife of Chris Kyle. I'm not usually into war movies, but this is a very good one that explores not only war but the effect it has on the soldiers and their families. Bradley Cooper was facing a tough field for best actor this time, but he definitely deserved to be nominated -- and might have won in a less competitive year. The battle scenes are convincing, with more human interaction than whiz-bang special effects. A thoughtful movie.",1432944000,,634,4.427350427350428

Nobody, including this character, validly or invalidly, portrayed can participate in war without some consequence. Side effects are more than hyper vigilance and as demonstrated here - he could not stay home and relate to his family.  It is also noteworthy as to how many people were questioning what the hell they were doing there in the first place - where once he responded to stop them from coming to the streets of my town.  The portrayal of the invasion into citizens homes whether opposition or not, and the terror in the faces of the families also gives pause as to who was being helped in the final analysis.  If this character was in WW II fighting Germans or Japanese, a known enemy quantity, the actions may have seemed more heroic.  In the confusing, obfuscated, melee of this action, the heroism may be surviving and coming home with sanity.",1432944000,,943,4.656626506024097

6978551,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I read the book first, Chris Kyle's autobiography.  It was odd, reading his first-person account, knowing that he was killed not long after the book was published, and how ironic that he survived the in-country combat, but the war followed him home and killed him here.  I was curious to see how the film would be: Hollywood blockbuster, full of sound and fury, or if there would be at least equal amounts of dialog and noise.  I should have just trusted Clint Eastwood.  The combat scenes are balanced by many back-home stories, some quiet, some rowdy, but every minute was spent telling Chris' story.  Everything rings true, the people and settings don't sound and look like a slick ""movie"".  The story just feels real.  And Bradley Cooper - I just forgot he was Bradley Cooper.  Chris Kyle's family and friends have commented in interviews how well he captured Chris' personality and mannerisms.  This is an excellent, strong film, highlighting an extraordinary man, Navy Seals, and not least, families of military who stay strong at home.",1432944000,,1042,4.908571428571428

This movie is more like a documentary: lots of bits of pieces strung together. I prefer movies that have a tighter story. I have seen Clint Eastwood movies that flow better (Million Dollar Baby), that are entertaining, have more obvious character development and are just as dark, or even darker. And has a music score that I like better.

Bradley Cooper was convincing as Chris Kyle. Maybe the real Chris Kyle was very opaque and did not express much emotions, so Cooper portrayed him accurately. The set and other characters are very convincing. For me, the primary purpose of commercial movies is to entertain, to touch the audience emotionally. This movie falls short of achieving this for me.",1432944000,,787,4.822222222222222

But this movie has to be one of most boring movies I've seen overall. There is no plot, no interesting characters, the war/combat scenes are mediocre at best and there is absolutely no entertainment value in it. I normally enjoy war movies, recently saw Fury and liked it, was a good entertaining movie; same goes for Hurt locker, which had good combat scenes albeit boring story/plot.

Overall I felt that I wasted 1hr + of my life watching an uninteresting auto-biography of your average redneck (you know...cowboy grows in ranch, drives trucks, has no education, rides patriotic train, gets young wife pregnant, joins the army, believes in god, yada yada yada) that's literally the life of millions of country boys in USA. So I don't get how making a movie about this was remotely considered as a good idea. They could've made it more entertaining with better combat scenes and what not to compensate the lack of plot and overall uninteresting topic, but they didn't even do that.",1432944000,13,1237,4.748837209302326

6978762,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"As a military family member I am very critical of most films and the way service members are depicted. Animalistic, careless killers. Some are of that nature, but not all. While I did further my research before seeing this film I really had a neutral opinion of Chris Kyle. Chris Kyle the patriot, savior sniper of our time. Chris Kyle the liar, the ""fluffer"" of the truth.. The ""one who let down his fellow comrades"" and ""owes millions"" the truth. Upon reading more and more about this man I became intrigued. What way would his story be told? In my opinion Cooper did an amazing job. He depicted him with a realism they don't capture in most films. I like that his PTSD showed, and made him strong yet vulnerable at times. I like that each kill he considered taking was with the utmost respect he could possibly give, only to protect his own. This is not a propaganda film, but a film that depicts one navy seals story and that of his spouse. What you see on the outside is not always the same perplexion on the inside of what every military individual deals with. This film showed the aspect that war is difficult and it does take a toll on each and every one involved. For that I give some kudos.",1432944000,,1200,4.385650224215246

6978904,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"If anything shows the necessary conflicts inherent in many of the extenuating circumstances of defending Freedom through War, ""American Sniper"" gets my vote. You'd like to hope through all of it that somehow it balances out in the end, but the fog of war obscures many insights and answers until sometime later. War is the only option and then as a chilling paradox, it's also the worst thing Humanity can use. While War can sometimes be the utter horror of sane people, its first victim is usually Morality. After that, try as we might, Geneva Conventions in mind, all bets are off; everything is a weapon and the mind can be the most deadly type of ammunition; the heart is wrenched from chests and used as a piece gauze or a bandaid. Days on the battlefield are just 5.56 mm rounds you load into clips as your humanity ends up leaving through the end of a barrel at the flick of a selector switch and the death-grip on the trigger. Mastering the rhythms of your breathing is less about edifices to Yoga and more about not ""canting"" your sniper rifle, or ""jerking"" the shot, so a 1/16 of an inch off at you hide, is not a foot off at 500, 600 yards downrange; what you miss today is likely to come back and kill someone else tomorrow--missing is not an option.. You are the Yin and Yang of Life and Loss; you are the CEO of Death and Duty; you are the sole, lifelong arbiter of your Fate; the independent mediator of an investigation that will follow you around for the rest of your life, with the findings in doubt; the last round is the one you can never use because it protects that last shred of Humanity. Did ""American Sniper"" depict a life used in the defense of Freedom? Yes. Did it also show the insanity of War? Yes. That person was a man before he was a sniper; after he was a sniper he was a good family man who was a veteran trying to help other veterans--until he was shot in the back by a veteran he was trying to help. Was ""American Sniper"" about the best and worst times of Humanity? Yes, sadly...",1432944000,,2015,4.333333333333333

If I rate the movie on how I liked it I give it a two star, if I rate it on accuracy I give it a 5 star knowing the story is real made it a very sad story.

Without spoiling anything, I really liked the story of Kyle and his motivations for joining the military but also his story of when he returned home to the states. I thought Bradley Cooper did an excellent job as Kyle.
Sounds odd, but I wished the movie was longer to tell more about certain characters and events. Guess I need to read the book.

I am not a vet, but my brother had previously served a few tours now. He had struggles when he returned and I am glad to see that element is a focus of the story.

Maybe my only knock on the movie is some of the Hollywood dramatization and some obvious props. But I would easily watch it again.",1432944000,,758,4.220689655172414

6978949,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"If this film is about how it is difficult to go to war, return home, go back, etc. - and deal with the loss of comrades, then it is well done.  If it is about sniper operations in Iraq, it is awful.

The story of soldiers at war - their struggles with family, the mental scars of battle, the modesty of valor, and the guilt of being a survivor are age-old themes that are, until we get killer robots, going to remain true and relevant.  American Sniper got this right.  But what did it get wrong?

The battle scenes / sniper actions were more than not simply inaccurate - they were unnecessarily so.

- the spotter doesn't spot, but sits against the wall chatting.  The job of a spotter is to look through a wide angle binocular or monocular and spot targets, as well as to provide general situational awareness.  A sniper scope is just too focused for this task.  The spotter and sniper switch off, to reduce eye and brain fatigue.

-a SEAL sniper would not decide he was bored and go down and join the grunts in door-to-door searches.  The Marines are relying on the sniper for overhead cover and surveillance.

-Telephone call during the battle?  Several times??  No real soldier, let alone a SEAL, would jeopardise the safety of his soldiers and comrades to have a chat with his wife.

Directors need to make artistic changes to the real story.  Add a climax where there might not be one.  Consolidate characters.  Create an enemy and nemesis.  They have to omit things, such as in this case most of the controversies about the Iraq War itself.  This is fine.  But the inaccuracies I mention above - and these are just some of them - add no value to the film and make Kyle seem to be a lot less professional than he probably was.",1432944000,16,1733,4.420886075949367

6979000,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"Bradley Cooper is excellent in this movie, but the movie itself needed to be tightened up quite a bit. In adapting the biography, the film should have left out Kyle's days as a bronco rider prior to joining the Navy, and cut down quite a bit on his time in SEAL training, and instead spent the time expanding on Kyle's relationship with his wife and his teammates in Iraq, as they all come across as a bit two dimensional in the film. It would have been a much better film if the focus had been squarely on Kyle's time in Iraq and his transition back to civilian life after leaving the service. While Kyle's early days might make the book more interesting, in the movie it eats up time that would have been better spent on developing the supporting characters, the conflict between Kyle and the opposing sniper, and the mental toll of repeated combat tours.",1432857600,,857,4.5

The movie is so well done, so well directed that it puts you there where ""The Legend"" Chris Kyle was. It allows you to see the war through his eyes and experience what he did. There is a bonus disc that includes a behind the scenes look during the making of the film. This is the kind of movie you cannot just watch once. Bradley Cooper nailed it as Chris Kyle. This man is a true American Hero, his service to our Country we should all be grateful for. This movie shows the dedication and sacrifice our servicemen/women and their families- make all the time. This is an unforgettable, gripping true story of a true American Legend, who was able to be the Hero that he was with the unshakable strength of his American Wife, Taya Kyle.

Unbelievable.  Our warriors do not have the weeks to decompress as they come back on ships.  They are in warfare one day and home the next.

It's heart breaking that Chris Kyle was trying to save the warriors at home--watching their backs as he did in war, and he was killed by someone he was trying to help.

Movie description from Google:
U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) takes his sole mission -- protect his comrades -- to heart and becomes one of the most lethal snipers in American history. His pinpoint accuracy not only saves countless lives but also makes him a prime target of insurgents. Despite grave danger and his struggle to be a good husband and father to his family back in the States, Kyle serves four tours of duty in Iraq. However, when he finally returns home, he finds that he cannot leave the war behind.",1432857600,,755,4.740458015267175

Ultimately, this is really a story about a warrior and the war itself is just a part (albeit a major part) of his story. Very well done.",1432857600,,499,4.555555555555555

This movie is about a Navy Seal sniper fighting in Iraq after  Sept. 2001 ""9/11"". This is a true story. The navy Seal is Chris Kyle. Which to this day has the most combatant kills of any U.S. sniper. The movie goes into a little  of boot camp and family life.

6979254,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I was prepared for a ""rah rah""  American military film, but found instead a profound indictment of the way in which Americans treat their military.  While there are hundreds of posts on Facebook ""honoring"" our troops, this film shows how enen, or perhaps, especially, those who join with high intentions are horribly damaged, at the very least emotionally.  The film shows the tremendous pressure on The Legend ( Bradley Cooper) and how unprepared his wife and family are when he comes home.  There is an unrealistic expectation on their part ( counseling for families clearly NOT a part of the program) that the returned family member will simply slip back into a former life style, take out the trash, play in the yard with the kids.  This film was so well done, so haunting in its brutality - to our troops - and on those we fight...but most of all a message to us all, to not look solely to the flag waving when we talk about putting boots on the ground.",1432857600,,958,4.546511627906977

What impressed me most was the mental aftermath of war and being a sniper at that. Very well acted, Cooper gave us the realistic account of a man who served his country in the way he was taught with dedication of the Navy elite. Cooper convinced me of the emotional trauma that comes with that occupation.
Only those who have served know how truly awful war is and the consequences of misjudgement or failure.

6979379,1,B00SB9Y6KW,"I knew nothing about Chris Kyle when starting this movie so I had absolutely no bias going into it and knew nothing about him being an alleged psychopathic serial killer. From an entertainment standpoint this movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, the action scenes were dull, the dialogue had no gravitas, I felt no emotion from the actors, it was completely stale and boring. Terrible film making aside, my biggest disappointment with this movie was that it entirely missed the mark, it took 2 hours of dull battle scenes to finally get to the part where I hoped we'd actually get to learn about how the war affected Chris Kyle, what we got instead was 20 minutes of glorifying a 1-dimensional character that never grew throughout the entire movie. The film completely failed to show how the horrors of war affected Chris and his family, along with the many service men and women like him. My best friend was a sniper who served two tours in Iraq, when he came home his second time around he wasn't the same person, there was no glory in how the war affected him, this film is an insult to anyone who served in the war and everyone involved in making this should be ashamed of themselves for capitalizing on the sympathies of an ignorant audience.

6979406,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I have not read the books, and im basing my opinion completely on entertainment/movie value.  This is not the best war movie ive ever seen,  there are some serious shocking images that are hard to fight back tears,  watching Bradley cooper play Mr kyle and struggle with PTSD was heartbreaking. knowing how the movie ends before you start watching it is troubling.  Watching this mans wife and children struggle with a absent father serving his country through 4 tours in hard to digest.  Knowing this is based off the real life of a American soldier and its not just Hollywood fiction makes you think on what your watching.  With those thoughts said and out of the way, I found Bradley coopers performance to be simply amazing, The emotions he conveyed were very real to the audience and helped me connect with what this actor was going through the entire time.  I wouldn't call this movie ""entertaining""  I would call it heartbreaking.  Knowing your watching someone's life on the big screen, knowing what they have done to protect others, knowing the sacrifices they have made, and knowing they were killed while trying to help others..  you make a connection.. and knowing how this story ends its just that much harder.. Its not like watching your favorite star in a fictional action movie die.  Its reality.  May God bless all our past and our present service members.

The star of the film lived a life of lies and serial killing, now the western governments are keeping his legacy alive by continuing to kill as many innocents as possible.

6979434,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"What a brilliantly put together movie! Clint Eastwood is such a gifted director. The emotions, this movie invoke, are many. It gives the viewer a look into Chris Kyle's life; his childhood and the strong ethics and values instilled by his parents; the, kind, young man he grew into; his deep love of country and commitment to serve; the new husband, then father. This man was onto something, in helping other soldiers with PTSD.  He had already given so much of himself.  But,he continued giving,making a positive difference in this world.  What a sad, horrible, way his life was cut short. By a man who was contributing nothing. But whom Chris Kyle thought he may be able to help.

6979442,3,B00SB9Y6KW,"The American public has developed a peculiar relationship with it's military over the last 70 years.  WW2 was the last ""popular"" war.  By ""popular"" I mean supported and understood as necessary by the vast majority of the American public.  Korea was really the 1st war to test the average American's willingness to support a morally dubious and probably unnecessary and even possibly harmful war.  It was America's 1st war where America could be seen as the aggressor.  All of the wars since WW2 have involved America being seen by many Americans as the aggressor.  Vietnam was, of course, hugely unpopular and controversial & is generally understood to have been morally wrong.  It continues to be an extremely divisive issue.  Unfortunately, many of the soldiers who served in Vietnam were mistreated and disrespected by civilians during and after the war.  This has, understandably, led to some contentiousness and hard feelings that linger to this day.

Many servicepeople feel they are disrespected, misunderstood and unappreciated by the American public.  Many servicepeople and their supporters are belligerent and hostile to the slightest bit of criticism. They frequently express the understanding that any criticism of the military is unpatriotic.  Many insist they don't care.  Many express frustration.  Many arrogantly demand gratitude.  Many civilians honor their service.  Some civilians treat servicepeople with an adulation akin to worship and vigorously defend them.  On the other hand, many civilians see servicepeople as dupes; unwitting pawns in games played by sophisticated politicians.  A few civilians even see servicepeople as crazed murderers.

The movie American Sniper is about a young man who is raised in a traditionally conservative (Christianity & patriotism), even simplistic manichean morality by a stern father.  We see that Chris has a temper and can be a bit crazed at times.  He joins the military and, eventually, serves as a sniper in Iraq and proves to be extremely effective.  He serves 4 tours and returns home in between tours and after his service damaged by PTSD.  We see how his experiences in war have traumatized him and how they alienate him from his wife and kids and normal life and how he attempts to recover and live a normal life.  That's pretty much the entire movie.

Clint Eastwood makes no secret of or apology for his conservative leanings.  In most of his movies, he leaves room for independent thought.  Here, he simple tells you what he thinks and what he thinks you should think.  Take it or leave it. There is, unfortunately, very little nuance here.  He portrays Chris Kyle as a basically decent and uncomplicated man in a terrible situation.  A man who sincerely believes he is protecting his country and his fellow servicepeople from ""savages"".

The movie is, of course, a commercial fictional production (loosely based on the real life of Chris Kyle).  It was made as a product designed to make money by appealing to the widest possible audience.  One might fairly argue Eastwood and the other makers of this movie are cynically cashing in on the casual patriotism of many Americans.  Consequently, the movie indulges in false drama, movie trope clichs, exciting action scenes, simple moralizing and jarring product placement.  The acting is merely servicable.  For a lead character, Kyle doesn't talk much.  Bradley Cooper has been roundly praised for, it would seem, mumbling cliches and looking troubled.  No real effort is made by the script to have Kyle explain what he thinks and how he feels beyond feelings of duty and brotherhood.  We are left to vaguely grasp at what he is about in a sort of take-it-or-leave-it way.  No effort is made to understand any of the other characters in their own context.  The movie feels, in general, like a collection of scenes in search of a narrative.  The ending is perfunctory, simplistic and unconvincing.  The final credits roll over real footage of Chris Kyle's funeral procession.  This exploiting what was a very emotional and profound moment for many Americans is extremely manipulative of the audience and I thought was rather gutless and insecure of Eastwood.  It's the movie equivalent of adding a bunch of exclamation points after a written opinion.  You may not like him but lots of people do, so there!!!!!!  Whatever, Clint.  Don't tell me, tell the chair.",1432684800,6,4383,5.09845288326301

Every time it's his ""call"" to determine who is a threat and deserves being killed.  No one is going to second guess the ""legend"" so he is judge, jury and executioner in a split second.  We invade their country based on lies and fear-mongering promoted by the Bush Administration and the movie glorifies the brutality of US forces.

6979457,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I liked the movie but it was quite different from the book so if you read the book first just be prepared.  There is very graphic violence, on both sides, just as there is in war.  Early on Kyle is faced with the decision as to whether to shoot a child that might be about to attack American forces with a grenade.  When I was in Vietnam I faced the same dilemma, fortunately I didn't have to shoot, because the bad guys would pull the pin on a hand grenade, hand it to a child, and tell them to hand it to the American.  I don't see how our service people operate today.  In the book Kyle explains how every situation he was in he had to justify his actions.  Sometimes women and children are enemy combatants and you have to do what needs to be done, just don't make a mistake or you're going to jail.",1432598400,,803,4.082802547770701

6979485,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"This was just released on Blu-Ray (what I was waiting for) and I viewed it the other day.
I had heard that the movie depicted rather well the strain on both soldiers and their families from extended or repeated deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the extreme difficulty of readjusting to civilian life if you had been through years of combat.

The movie does depict that rather well I thought (speaking as someone who didn't personally have to go through it).  In my fathers generation and grandfathers generation were men who survived World War II and World War I, respectively.  In my generation are men who survived the Vietnam War, and now in a younger generation we have hundreds of thousands of men and women who have been through tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Those Ive seen who seemed to adjust the best to a return to civilian life seem to do it by walling off their war experiences [at some point] and not wanting to think about them again.  Otherwise, its like they never really leave the war, and the civilian world around them all seems very unreal; they cannot relate to it.

Chris Kyle was a Texan and an athletic young man, the type who often makes a great soldier.  He was an excellent shot with hunting rifles before he joined the service after 9/11.  He also was a competitive wild horse rider in rodeos, a physically dangerous and demanding job requiring strength, balance, very rapid reflexes and coordination.  He ended up in the SEALS and specialized as a sniper, ending up with the highest number of officially recognized kills in military history.

The movie follows him from a brief glimpse of childhood with his father, to rodeo, to joining the service and meeting his wife at a barthen through the course of four deployments and brief intervals at home on leave in between.  About halfway through the movie, the focus really started to shift from the combat missions to his struggle to reintegrate with family and home.  This was on his leave home before his fourth, final tour of duty.  He then returns home having left the service, but its very much a struggle for him to really be present with his family.  The film depicts some symptoms of PTSD as well---not to say that Kyle had diagnosable PTSD, but some symptoms related to it.

Toward the end it shows Kyle working with disabled veterans and those just having mental trouble reintegrating into civilian life.  It closes with him meeting, and driving off with the troubled veteran who shot both him and his friend dead at a shooting range, and as closing credits roll we see images of his very well-attended funeral procession.  The film was directed bywouldnt you know itClint Eastwood, who has made films about physical conflict a hallmark of a very long career.

This film doesnt try to make any political statements about whether war in Iraq or in Afghanistan was a good thing or a bad thing.  It simply depicts the effects of going through it on one mana man who became an American hero for many veterans and their families.  It was well-done.  Though it was no comedy, it was also not unduly gory considering the subject matterits more in the nature of a character study.  I give it a B+, and Bradley Coopers acting was, as usual, excellent.",1432512000,,3247,4.669595782073814

6979497,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"As most of us have heard, War Is Hell, and this film brings that realization up to the fore. What we see are the blood and gore, and a little of the emotional damage done to our troops. Four tours, how in God's name does anyone think this makes any kind of sense. Killing day after day takes it's toll.

Chris Kyle is called a hero, but what are we glorifying, a man who has killed 160 people. How could one man accept this, how could he live with it. Well, he put it to one side, saying that he was saving others. I can't help but believe that Chris Kyle would have had difficulty his entire life, if his life hadn't been taken by another soldier, what irony. This is a sad story of what war has done to one man.

Bradley Cooper has done an amazing character reenactment. I don't think, however, enough time was spent on the emotional ravages of wars of four tours of duty. 1,000 days in the life of a man. I hope we never see another film like this. 22 veterans commit suicide every day. Let's help.

I'm not a big fan of war movies and there were scenes in this one that got long and intense, and I'll admit that the mute button helped me watch them.  But I was riveted to the screen from the start of this movie, and I loved it.  It was about war and a trained sniper shooting people and drama and all of that, but it was about so much more.  It was a very well-made movie about a man's life and his sense of purpose and his wife and his family and his incredibly strong sense of patriotism and duty and the conflicts that go with all of those things.

I think this movie shows the difficulty in adjusting to civilian life after being in the front lines.  It opens up our eyes as civilians as to how great the sacrifice of our soldiers really is.

I am a Veteran, and I've known plenty of guys who were exactly as gun ho and rabidly patriotic as Kyle so I can understand his devotion to duty and the  movie did a good job of showcasing that.

It was just too long, and in the end they glossed over him putting his entire team in danger in order to shoot the sniper.  I have no idea how true that part was, nor do I know what sort of aftermath came from a review of those actions.

I was the wife of a marine who went off to war, so I can relate...I had two small children as well.  He clearly wanted to be a career soldier.  But what he did is no more than what all the others who have served over there have done!  They should all have movies made about them!  It's hard to imagine after all he went through, that he had to come home to be killed.  I will also never understand why a seasoned veteran who should know better would take a man with PTSD to a rifle range!!  That doesn't make sense to me.

I have a Samsung 60-inch wide-screen HD television and Samsung Blu-ray player.  Previous purchases of movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Hornet's Nest always filled out the entire TV screen.

6979509,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"I wanted to see American Sniper for a while but my bad, never got around to catching it in the theater. Or maybe I just knew that it was the kind of film I didn't want to watch in public because certain stories are so gut wrenching.

I watched it last night and Im still affected by it. Which I suppose is the mark of a good film  that youd be thinking about it the next day.

Clint Eastwood approached the story in his usual understated style and treated it with respect and sensitivity. His depiction of war, military life on and off the battlefield, and our troops was real without the usual Hollywood romanticization or exploitation that so many of these types of films possess.

The film is the story of Chris Kyle, distinguished by having the highest number of recorded sniper shots of any soldier in American military history. His nickname was the Legend. But Kyle wasn't the kind of man who cared about fame or flattering nicknames, he cared about his fellow soldiers and keeping them out of harms way. He cared about keeping our guys alive. And its what drove him to do four tours in Iraq.

The film chronicles Chriss military life and family life in between his tours. And its hard to evaluate the story because its not a story, its what happened to one man. Its his story. The story of a man who wanted to make a difference and did. The story of a man who put others before himself. The story of a man who lived his beliefs and principles. A man that most of us wouldve liked and been happy to share a beer with or call a friend. Sadly, his devotion and desire to help, ultimately led to his death. Not on the battlefield but at home.

I highly recommend this film not because it glorifies war but because it celebrates the perserverance of the human spirit. It shows that one man can make a difference and did. And it honors those who stand the watch so that we can have the freedoms we enjoy and take for granted every day.

I thank Chris Kyle for his service. I thank his family for their sacrifice.",1432512000,,2013,4.337765957446808

America and Americans need to return to what we once were. Kyle is what Jesse Ventura wishes he could be.,1432512000,,378,4.573529411764706

6979516,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Clint Eastwoods latest war movie is American Sniper. A war drama bio of  U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle the most lethal sniper.  American Sniper delivers with several kill scenes that are competently done, but the film  misses the complexities of the topics it deals with in the book.
Bradley Cooper is simply perfect as Chris Kyle the most lethal sniper in the US military.  A four star cinema  action-filled war drama.
Clint Eastwoods confident touch as director, focusing on Chris Kyle in a simple approach to storytelling. I am also impressed with the intensity and vulnerability Bradley Cooper brought to the part.",1432512000,,614,4.980392156862745
6979517,1,B00SB9Y6KW,Terrible language. I found it to be very offensive. Too bad because the story is great. Definitely not for children.,1432512000,2,116,4.85
6979518,4,B00SB9Y6KW,"Pretty great film about an American hero.  The thing is, this super soldier is one among MANY who feel they need to FINISH things.  They need to protect us all.  They need to go back and save their fellow heroes.  A lot of us don't get it.  We are separated from the reality of the war going on in the sandy hell-holes of the Middle East.  Apathy sets in.  This movie helps you understand who these human beings are, and it makes you grateful that they are on OUR side.  It also shows you that they are just like you and me!  They've got a LOT to lose, yet they fight an insanity overseas to make sure it stays put.

This movie depicts those savages in the Islamic terrorist organizations very well.

American Sniper depicts the calm-before-storm in war, the frenetic surprise combat situations in war, and the simple humanity of our soldiers very well!  One second here, next second dead.

We also get to see that the Islamic maniacs have a few super-villains of their own, like the Syrian sniper Kyle has to deal with.

The movie bounces back and forth between leave time and tour time, a few flashbacks, and the sad realities of war.

War is sh%$, but when the animals in the Middle East bring it, only guys like Kyle can help us face their evil.  And make no mistake, you will see their evil in this film.  Do some reading afterward,  We truly are up against an almost-fantastical breed of evil human beings who control a brainwashed army of zombies.

The bad reviews are by people who do not understand war, do not WANT to understand Islam, and frankly would get us all killed if they ever gained political power.  Watch the movie before you call Kyle a psychopath or warmonger.  This movie is an Anti-War movie if there ever was one.  But it recognizes that, because of some evil humans, there is a peace we can only have THROUGH war.

This one man's story mirrors a LOT of other soldiers' lives.  Read his book.  My only complaint is that I wanted to see more about the war on the ground.  More combat situations.  More action.

Support the troops.  Pray for them and wish them well.

R.I.P Kyle and all we have lost.",1432512000,,2124,4.399484536082475
6979519,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"First read the book and then watch the movie.  The movie does follow the book well but with all movies based upon books, it has to select certain things from the book otherwise the movie would wind up being 4 hours long.  I can summarize this film as a patriotic man who joined the military after 9/11 and was doing what he felt needed to be done to protect his country.  But Chris Kyle was also a very troubled man and who wouldn't be given the hell he went through.  My personal favorite scene was when Chris killed the Fallujah sniper at over 1 mile out.  An incredible shot!

To those who believe that this movie is somehow degrading to Muslims, you're wrong on so many levels.  Those who choose to believe that either haven't seen the movie or didn't understand when Chris Kyle used the word ""savages"" he was speaking about those he was fighting against.  Watch the movie and see what these ""savages"" did to the locals in Fallujah with a cordless drill.  Those were the bastards Chris Kyle was referring to!",1432512000,,1012,4.456521739130435

#2: I read all the negative reviews for entertainment.

The movie is far better than those those entertaining reviews. It depicts what a significant portion of our citizenry directly or indirectly experienced expressed succinctly via one person's point of view. As the saying goes, ""Simplicity is the Sister of Genius.""

The movie was a little disappointing to me, it was not respectful of the US military. It was not emotionally charged, it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. The movie didn't show the humorous side and prideful side and the comradery in the military. It was a good movie overall.",1432425600,,429,4.375

6979547,5,B00SB9Y6KW,"First of all, i am a passifist. I don't like war but realize that sometimes it is a neccesary evil. I did not agree with the Iraq war however i fully supported our men and women in uniform. They had no choice but to go over there because when the United States Govt says go, you go.
With that being said, this movie was a powerful and moving movie that every American needs to watch. I never realized what the American soldier endured during war and when they came home until after i watched this movie.
Yes Chris Kyle killed a lot of people but then again he was a Navy Seal and Navy Seals are trained to kill. I look at it as him doing his job, not killing people for the fun of it.
This movie really brought to light PTSD and how it effects the brave men and women who go to war. Ironically Klye survives a war only to be killed back home by someone suffering from PTSD.
I watched this on opening weekend in a packed theater. I stayed on the edge of my seat and glued to my screen the entire movie. There was not one dry eye in that theater once the credits started rolling. People filed out of the theater in complete stunned silence. It felt like i was leaving a funeral. I had to sit in my car for ten minutes before i could leave because i needed to digest everything i had just watched. Even after i got home i just felt the need to be quiet. I bought the movie today and will be watching it tomorrow on Memorial Day as a tribute to the brave men and women wo have given their lives for our country.",1432425600,,1507,4.060402684563758
