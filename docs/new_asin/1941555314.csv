8129127,5,1941555314,Anyone with family members or church members with dementia needs to read this book.  It is easy reading and most helpful in giving ideas on how to best serve those with dementia.  I passed it on to church leaders to read and review.  We also watched the video at our monthly Caregivers class.,1498176000,,292,4.471698113207547
8129128,5,1941555314,"Now that When Words Fail has given me the tools for keeping the connection with my friends with dementia, I no longer hesitate to visit them.  Seeing Kathy Berry interact on the DVD and have deep connections with patients in all stages of dementia gives me confidence to do the same, for her book and DVD guide me to know what works and what doesnt.  Im buying the book and DVD for all my friends with loved ones with dementia, and those in ministry and health care, hoping the skills taught will soon have widespread use.",1485820800,2,522,4.427083333333333
