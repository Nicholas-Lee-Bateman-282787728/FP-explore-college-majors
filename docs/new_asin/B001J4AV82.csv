8311855,1,B001J4AV82,I bought this DVD since I thought it was gonna be one of those Rock N Roll metal movies boy I was wrong. This movie is so boring Not once did  I see Camille Solari wearing that outfit in the movie plus the music was so boring I watched maybe half of it and was very disappointed. I advise you if you want a good Rock N Roll Flick Buy Prey For Rock N Roll or School of Rock!,1250208000,,373,3.721518987341772
