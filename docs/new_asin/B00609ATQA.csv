8490199,5,B00609ATQA,"""Around the World With Fanny Hill"" is an R-rated film that runs just over an hour and a half, came out in 1974, directed by Mac Ahlberg, and stars Shirley Corrigan, Gaby Fuchs, Marie Ekorre, and many others.  A Swedish adult comedy produced by Tore Sjberg, the story starts in Stockholm, goes to Hollywood California USA, Hong Kong, Venice, Munich, and other legendary locations, and basically is a vehicle for lots of T & A, delivering more than this reviewer thought any movie did during that time period (the 1970's).  The volume, picture, and color are all very good on this DVD.  Definitely adult, not for underage audiences or for viewing with your parents either.  It is an English language jolly romp of erotica and nudity yet keeping a theme, albeit a hokey and shallow one (with an annoying soundtrack), still there is a story line and continuity, and great background architecture.  Most films like this all you get is one or two actresses going buff and only briefly at that.  This film goes ahead with a full orgy based party, and many other sexual situations with all the trimmings.  Surprisingly delightful, and entertaining more than most reviews let on.  This folks, is a 5 star flesh-fest.  Bon Apptit (or should I say, Smaklig mltid!), or if you prefer, En Guete! (A.K.A. ""Jorden runt med Fanny Hill"" on the IMDb.)",1333324800,16,1333,4.760869565217392
