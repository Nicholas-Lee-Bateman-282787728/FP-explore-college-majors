3789981,1,B001TH37NU,"Yet another repackaging of existing NASA documentaries. If you have any NASA history compilations already then chances are you already own most or all of the material on this new piece of work. Apparently the shuttle program can be summed up as follows; the first eight flights, Challenger disaster, Christa McAuliffe the only person on the Challenger who matters, Columbia disaster, the end. Hubble, flights to Mir, the ISS, scientific research? For get about it.

It is time for a comprehensive shuttle program documentary.

The packaging is nice.",1244332800,18,549,5.2272727272727275
8341346,5,B001TH37NU,This is a great history of the shuttle. You get to hear from the astronauts that flew it. Great history lesson.,1465948800,,111,4.333333333333333
8341347,2,B001TH37NU,"The packaging is the best part of this collection.
The video work has poor research and correlation between the video and the narrative. There were also numerous mistakes in so far as reporting of weights, speeds, etc.
The only other ""highlight,"" if it can be called that, is the video coverage of the Columbia STS-107 Memorial Service at JSC Houston, which I had not previously seen  on the public feed. The collection tended to spend a great deal of time on both the Challenger and Columbia accidents, without very much overall coverage of the Shuttle's successful flights.
Save you money and purchase real spaceflight history DVDs from Spacecraft Films.",1423872000,3,656,5.018348623853211

8341351,5,B001TH37NU,"Fantastic account of history of the Space Shuttle from the Enterprise down to the Endeavour- from the sad events of Columbia and the Challenger..  Launching of HUBBLE telescope, a long term boon for those who love the exploriation, wether telescopic or Space Travel  Love it  A Peter J  Barr",1390348800,4,291,4.877551020408164
8341352,1,B001TH37NU,"How to ruin the story of one of mans' most impressive achievements:

* Take thousands of public domain shots of the programme.
* Assemble them in an incoherent, jumbled order.
* Repeat - in many cases - footage over and over again.
* Devise a mind-numbing soundtrack that repeats continually.
* Make sure the sound level varies dramatically from scene to scene.
* Avoid ""losing"" shots that the viewer couldn't possibly identify.
* Don't do even a common sense, gross error check of the numbers that are given. (Example: the shuttle weighs in at 2,000 tons (tonnes?) at liftoff. A few seconds later the commentary states that at liftoff the thrust is 6m tons (tonnes?. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that this would accelerate the occupants out through their bottoms). Basic stuff, this.
* Did I mention repeat videos again and again?

The producers have managed this in spades.

I could go on - and on - but, suffice it to say this space junkie was completely disappointed by a dismal and apparently amateur attempt to document this incredibly impressive projects.",1362009600,,1083,4.811827956989247
8341353,3,B001TH37NU,"Very disappointed, some stuff was real good. Full video of memorial for both Shuttle crews and video inside Columbia right before break up. Lot's missing, in fact it jumps right from Challenger to Columbia with nothing on the mission in between. Zero on Hubble depolyment  or the reapair mission to save it. Can't real call it History of the Space Shuttle without those missions. Nothing on the mission that first tested the MMU, some stuff of Sally Ride and her mission as the first US woman in Space. Over all I rate the Box set History of the Space Shuttle as a C-. If you want it try to get used as cheap as possible.",1347667200,4,621,4.4
8341354,2,B001TH37NU,"This 5 disc set contains mostly recycled NASA footage many collectors will already have, and the footage is not even re-mastered but direct video transfer (which leads to poor quality in a lot of cases). Add to that a lot of inaccurate information or inappropriate footage (saying the X-24B was the first powered lifting body and showing the X-24A). Like a lot of cheap productions they rely on footage in the public domain, sparse (often inaccurate) facts and not much else. Not bad for kids but not recommended for any serious space enthusiast.",1333324800,3,546,4.881720430107527
8341355,5,B001TH37NU,"The DVDs on the Space Shuttle are true to what this vehicle did for 30 years and 135 space shuttle missions to help build the International Space Station and to make history that man could and still can go to the ""final frontier"" and beyond.

The description on the back of this container that holds the DVD discs has 2 flaws in it.  It talks about the Challenger making history and that it was 16 minutes away from its landing destination on Earth on February 1st 2003.  CORRECTION:  Both of those indications of the Challenger are false and not true -- they both are for Columbia, the first space shuttle that went up into orbit above the Earth and that it did break up over the state of Texas on February 1, 2003.

FYI:  Challenger blew up on January 28, 1986, NOT February 1, 2003 -- February 1, 2003:  this date was for Columbia blowing up.  Both incidents had 7 crew members each on it when they both blew up.

Whoever created the description on the back of the DVD container should check their facts and hopefully will make a correction on the labels.

For those of you who are Space Shuttle officianados (sp?), check the label and you will see the 2 mistakes on it that are referring to the Challenger, NOT to Columbia.

Other than that, since the Space Shuttle program has ended on July 22, 2011, it has not ended an era of space exploration -- for manned space missions will start in 2014-2015 with missions to Mars and beyond.  The Space Shuttle has paved the way for future explorations of the ""Final Frontier"" and beyond, and it has made those of us who have followed the Space Shuttle since April 12 1981 when it went up into space for the first time, to see that we ALL can dream big and to reach for the stars and beyond.",1311292800,4,1737,4.3602484472049685
