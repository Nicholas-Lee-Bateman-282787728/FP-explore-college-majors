8195980,5,B000EZ3F1W,"World War II was the greatest military confrontation the world has ever known. On land and sea and in the air, the scale of the conflict was unprecedented.

But amid the great campaigns were many smaller-scale operations which were vital to Allied success - occasions when small numbers of men could have an effect out of all proportion to their numbers; occasions when the course of the war hinged on their courage and daring.

This series looks at six such raids. With the use of veterans' accounts; carefully researched archive film; meticulous reconstructions and 3-D graphics the viewer is put right into the heart of the action. The recreated raids include the British and Norwegian mission to smash Hitler's nuclear programme; the canoe-borne commando assault on Bordeaux to disrupt supplies of raw materials essential for Hitler's war machine; and the paratroop capture of a key German radar installation at Bruneval, which brought back information vital to enable Britain's bombers to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.

All six episodes from the series are included on this DVD - Stopping Hitler's Bomb, Prison Busters, Radar Beam Raiders, Storm at St Nazaire, Cockleshell Raiders and Arctic Commando Assault.
