2254195,1,B0007Z9R5M,"My daughter, age 2 1/2, is really into the princesses. I bought the first DVD and she really enjoyed it, so we added Beauty shines from within, thinking that it would be a very empowering, positive message type of stories. Wow, Disney really missed a great opportunity. This DVD was just ridiculous and a little scary. I was pretty angry when we watched it. What a complete waste of $20. I definitely wouldn't recommend it. It has ""disappeared"" from my daughter's movie drawer into the trash, where it belongs.",1134259200,10,510,4.741573033707865
2254196,1,B0007Z9R5M,Volume 1 is the best of all of them.  Volumes 2 and 3 are terrible!!!  My 5 year old daughter loves the first one.,1132963200,5,114,3.7083333333333335
2254197,1,B0007Z9R5M,"I completely agree with the other reviewers. My daughters (5 & 2) received this as a gift and we were all completely shocked by the horrific storylines. They were so negative and disturbing that my husband and I decided they are not allowed to watch this DVD. The title ""Beauty Shines From Within"" is totally deceiving, as the stories are anything but beautiful. The only one that was even decent was the Cinderella one, which was of poor quality and ""pieced together."" I ended up giving my girls a very early Christmas present of the Cinderella DVD to replace this one, and it is so much better it's not even comparable. Our whole family enjoys the Cinderella one. It's just too bad Disney has put so much other garbage out there - it makes me really think twice before buying any more Princess DVDs.",1131580800,17,801,4.569444444444445
2254198,1,B0007Z9R5M,I agree with the other customers who rated this DVD very low.  This DVD is such a big dissapointment to me.  My daughter hated it and both my husband and I watched it with her the first time (and the last) and thought that it was completely inappropriate for this age group.  It had no educational value and was not fun to watch.  I wish I could return it and get my money back on this.  I expected more from a Disney product.,1128902400,13,426,4.0843373493975905
2254199,1,B0007Z9R5M,"Well, I thought this would be a good movie for my daughter. I didn't like it at all. My wife and I were very disappointed with this movie. After watching this dvd once we decided NOT to let our daughter watch it again. The cover, title and commercials made it look appealing and delightful. It was terrible! I would expect alot more from a Disney film, especially one made for young girls.

I think you should stay away from this one!!",1127865600,17,435,4.37037037037037
2254200,1,B0007Z9R5M,"What a waste of money!  Mind you, I buy almost anything that has a Disney Princess on it for my daughter, but this one tops everything!  My 5 year old refuses to watch it and doesn't like Ariel and Jasmine anymore!  The princess's introductions to their stories are very choppy and poorly edited.  The Cinderella story is fine but the Ariel and Jasmine ones are NOT!  Basically, if Ariel laughs, she destroys everything around her (her home, for one!) and Jasmine gradually turns into this really scary looking snake, like a cobra with a hood and tongue and all!  I don't know what possessed Disney to use THESE stories, but I know I will not buy anymore 'Princess Stories' DVDs. I still will buy all sorts of princess stuff in the future and spend enough money on Disney that I should own at least half of the company, but I think everyone should get a fair warning to stay away from this one!",1127088000,49,894,4.45398773006135
2254212,4,B0007Z9R5M,to the customer who wrote that the ariel and jasmine episodes look like they came from a saturday morning cartoon: they did! the ariel one is now on disney junior but the jasmine one is not and the only way to see the episodes (legally) is on videos like this or the vhs releases. I wish they would put both cartoon series out on dvd but for now I'll just have to buy the princess dvds.,1379808000,,386,4.092105263157895
2254213,5,B0007Z9R5M,"Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 3: Beauty Shines From Within is the final chapter of the series of Disney Princess adventures. This volume features Cinderella in an ""interactive"" storybook fantasy as well as two adventures with Ariel and Jasmine, each episode from the 1995 Little Mermaid and 1993 Aladdin TV animated series. The special features include sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like Disney Princess Christmas, Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie and Cinderella Special Edition. Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 3 is the perfect way to complete this DVD series and an excellent DVD for pre-schoolers. :)",1377043200,,614,5.473684210526316
2254214,5,B0007Z9R5M,I never seen vol 1 or 2 of this group but I was happy that one of my top 10 favorite episodes of Disney Aladdin and Little Mermaid TV series got put on DVD as well as a Little Mermaid TV series episode I really like since unlike Rescue Rangers or Talespin  neither Little Mermaid or Aladdin got box set releases.  Be nice if Little Mermaid episode Beach could be on one of these sets or Aladdin episode CHAOS.  I could never  tell from either Amazon or the back of the box description which episodes might be on first two volumes.  The TV series may not be the animation quality one see in the films or Princess Enchanted Tales special but if you like the TV series it nice to have a couple of episodes like we got with Tarzan and Jane DVD.,1371340800,,740,4.146853146853147
2254215,5,B0007Z9R5M,My daughter like this and that is who it is for so that's all that matters. If you don't want you child exposed to magic it's not for your child though.,1366156800,,152,3.935483870967742
2254216,5,B0007Z9R5M,This arrived in record time before Christmas. It was a gift for a little 2yr old girl. I'm sure she is enjoying the stories right now.,1356998400,,134,4.1923076923076925
2254217,1,B0007Z9R5M,"I couldn't have been more disappointed when the first story started. The DVD begins with a beautifully-animated sweep of a girl's bedroom (during which I got my hopes up!), but as soon as Ariel enters the story, the quality drops off significantly (and never recovers). The Ariel and Jasmine stories are poorly animated; looks more like cartoons when I was a kid (25 years ago!). The Cinderella story is just clips from the original movie, spliced together. Don't spend your money on this one - Disney certainly did all they could to avoid spending theirs.",1310428800,,556,4.863157894736842
2254218,1,B0007Z9R5M,"I'm usually pretty careful about what I let my 4 and 2 year old daughters watch. Beauty Shines From Within sounded harmless enough. The back of the box mentioned fun tales about Ariel, Cinderella and Jasmine. The description on the box failed to mention that Jasmine is turned into a red eyed, fanged, spike tailed giant hooded green snake by a shape shifting evil sorceress cat person. Thanks, Disney. That's what I get for not previewing the movie first. When my 28 month old came up to me in the kitchen and asked me why Jasmine had red eyes and told me she was scared, I went in to see what was going on. I got there as Aladdin decided that if his true love was going to live life as a snake, so was he, so he rubbed the magic lotion on himself and became a giant, pupil-less blue snake. I guess that's true love for ya. These images are going to stick around in my household for awhile (they tend to pop back up at bedtime, imagine that).",1308787200,2,943,4.2444444444444445
2254219,5,B0007Z9R5M,"First off, Ups and downs in this DVD:

UPS: Ariel, Jasmine, Cinderella themed stories (and I guess Mulan), Teaching your child the theme of ""Beauty comes from inside,"" Disney trailers, Storybuilder special feature, seeing Jasmine being turned to a snake and many highlights of that Aladdin episode, beautiful cover art and interactive CGi menus.

DOWNS: The princess stories are just episodes from ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" that appeared in the 90's and a visual novel recap of the movie: ""Cinderella (you should know this by now based on volumes 1 and 2)"", the story introductions are 9 or 10 frames of the princesses lip synching the audio over and over again (who cares, big deal, its better than having no intro or closing at all...), the Jasmine story is said to be ""scary"" and the Ariel story is said to be ""depressing,"" said by mostly all the parents' reviews here (well, they're NOT, and below are my reasons why), no DVD inserts (oh, boo-hoo).

I bought this product and volumes 1 and 2 specifically because I read all these bad reviews on amazon, so I wanted to see if it was as bad as people said they'd be. To be honest, these are actually alright. Sure there's cheap recycled material when the princesses introduce their stories and stuffed with 90's episodes stolen from their old cartoons, and throw in a few ""visual novels (which I actually enjoyed)"" but its actually alright. Kids won't be scared of Jasmine turning into a snake, a bandit pointing a knife at Aladdin and almost dying from poisnous barbs or Ariel feeling depressed and running away from home. If children can watch Ursala being impailed by a ship, epic war scenes from Mulan, Malificent shouting: ""And all the powers of hell!"" and turning into a dragon, or any other Disney adult situations, they won't be scared of anything in this video. I only wished they included a Sleeping Beauty visual novel or even a Mulan and Pocahontas one (they're princesses too!) just like Cinderella and Belle had in volume 1 (""The big surprise"" and ""the perfect gift""). Volume 2 had a Snow White story (""The dinner dance""), and volume 3 had a recap of the Cinderella movie (""Cinderella Story,"" though instead of using still visuals, they actually included animated footage unlike the three previous ones). I think the cinderella story recap was put in this video to promote the Special Edition that was released sometime that year.

Just for my opinion, I thought the Jasmine story was interesting in a way how there were many themes of ""the Tree of Life"" and the ""Garden of Eden"" like an anime plot sorta, including the villain: Mirage and her base, and especially the ending where it states that Fasir had some past with her that might have been good for a season finale, hinting reasons why they couldn't be together (oops, spoiler much?). AND...even for a kids show, I found it touching when Jasmine said: ""I'll never leave you Aladdin...ever..."" and then a passionate kiss. For an old show, that episode had good stuff...(the Genie can cut back on the comic relief a bit...and Iago is as arragant as ever :)

The Story Builder special feature was entertaining too because they allowed Mulan a visual novel route to play through. The Ariel route in this feature is also entertaining because you are given the choice to attack Ursala with Dinosaurs...lol. I only wished that the characters in this feature had a their voices, rather than some nursery woman playing all their voices...

Anyways, to conclude this review, this DVD (and the first two) should be given a chance for its use of nostalgic footage and teaching young girls the importance of ""beauty from within,"" which it does. These are meant for kids after all, so even if there's recycled footage on here, kids wouldn't care. They didn't care when DiC or 4Kids reedited hit animes like ""One Piece, Naruto, Yu-Gi-Oh and Sailor Moon"" so why should they care if Disney does this for the princesses? Parents should squash their negative views of these Princess Stories DVDs and give them a fresh, new look for what they really are.

I give this product 4 and a half stars, for showing me the opposite of what these Amazon reviews said.",1308614400,4,4166,4.769764216366158
2254220,4,B0007Z9R5M,"I don't understand the ""horrified"" and bad reviews for the Princess Stories: Volume 3 dvd.(???)  My 4 yr old wanted Vol. 3 after seeing it advertised all the time on Volumes 1 & 2.  However, I didn't want to pay $20 after reading such bad reviews, so as a compromise, we rented it from the library. I explained what I heard would happen in the Ariel and Jasmine stories, we watched the dvd and my daughter LOVED IT and burst out laughing when Jasmine turns into a cobra over time.  Go figure, my daughter doesn't like to watch ""The Little Mermaid"" b/c of Ursula or looks away when Morgana grabs Baby Melody in ""Ariel II"", yet my girl uses a stuffed octopus and/or another doll as Ursula and Morgana when playing.  My daughter loved the Jasmine story so much that when her older brother came home from school, my girl explained the snake part and we ALL watched the dvd.  All my 7 yr old, ""anti-anything-girlie"" son could say was why did it take Aladdin only a few seconds to change into a blue cobra but took Jasmine a day? (Oops, did I spoil anything?) I explained to my son that some kids and parents didn't like the dvd b/c of this story.  He said if Disney made Jasmine into a purple or pink snake, parents would not mind the story. (He may be onto something.) If you or your kids are scared of snakes, don't watch this dvd. If your kids like new, funny, exciting, or scary things, this dvd is fine.  Definitely, not one of Disney's best, but JUST AS CORNY AND BAD as the other Princess dvds. Just our humble opinion.  Will I buy the dvd now?  Probably, to keep the ""collection"" complete and my daughter loves it so much.",1267747200,,1625,4.336633663366337
2254221,5,B0007Z9R5M,"The dvd is worth buying just for the old tv show of Aladdin and the little mermaid. They use to be my favorite shows to watch. My favorite Aladdin episode when I was a kid just happened to be the one where Jasmin turned into the snake. I thought it was amazing and still do. I was never scared by it and was 4 when the tv show originally aired. Kids today just have no spine that why they get stuck with shows like the new adventures od winniw the pooh, the wiggles and fenis and ferb and whatever else they have. I miss Old winnie the pooh, scooby doo, the oiginal power rangers, Thundercats, the animated batman series,ahhh real monster, as told by ginger, so werid, are you afraid of the dark and so many other good shows from my childhood. Children and Disney movies have gone down so much in my opinion and most other people born in the 80's and 90's. so thanks for bring classic disney back! I really hope they realse the old Aladdin tv show on dvd!",1231977600,3,955,4.224043715846994
2254241,1,B0007Z9R5M,"There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this video. It's the worse kind of Disney bottom budget Cash-In. They simply repackaged a few awful made-for-TV episodes that are too scary for younger viewers and too boring for older kids.
This DVD contains a few Disney Princess stories that were obviously culled from the early 90's Disney Channel made-for-TV episodes. The animation is terrible - nothing like the movies, and even the colors of some of the characters are wrong. The quality of the artwork on the cover of the DVD is MUCH better than the animation on the DVD itself.
The stories themselves are horrific. One has Ariel unable to laugh while evil blowfish cast spells on her companions. Then, there's a completely abridged version of Cinderella - using the movie's footage, it tells the whole story in about 5 minutes. The Jasmine / Aladdin story is atrocious. Besides the usual Disney Channel made-for-TV slipshod animation, you have Jasmine being turned into a scary snake and a bunch of bandits robbing them at knife point while Aladdin is drowning (!!!).
The so-awful-it's-funny part of the DVD is the hacked together ""intros"" to each segment which are performed by Ariel, Cinderella, and Jasmine. The animators took what looks like 15 frames of the character's mouths moving (culled from some scene in the actual theatrical releases), and played them in a loop, and then just dubbed audio over it. No attempt is made to match their mouths to the audio that you hear. A real low rate hack job. I've seen better attempts on YouTube.",1231200000,,1550,4.897338403041825
2254242,2,B0007Z9R5M,"i'm sorry to say that this is not a good video. they rushed to make it and it did not entertain my daughter. she is 17 months. the other disney videos are better. this one only had shots of cinderella, not the actual cinderella character.",1197849600,,238,4.311111111111111
2254243,5,B0007Z9R5M,"I bought this as a 5th birthday present for my daughter, and she loves it!  She watches it quite often.",1178928000,2,103,4.15
2254244,4,B0007Z9R5M,"My three-year old is a devoted princess fan, and we got this for her so that she could watch a princess movie without spending an hour and a half in front of the TV.  Both the Ariel and Jasmine sections are from the Saturday morning TV shows, and Cinderella is a retelling of her own story.  Yes, *I* think it's boring and low-budget, but my daughter loves it and that's what matters.  Plus, since each section is only 20-minutes or so long, she doesn't spend as much time in front of the TV.

As for it being too scary, I don't think there's anything scarier in these stories than in the original disney movies.  Jafar turns into a snake, Maleficent turns into a seriously scary dragon (not to mention those goblins), Ursula grows to enourmous size then gets stabbed in the stomach....if your kid isn't scared by those things, I doubt they'll be scared by this.",1156896000,4,862,4.5
2254245,1,B0007Z9R5M,A relative let us borrow this DVD. My 5 and 3 year old daughters wanted to watch the Jasmin story first. This story is not appropriate for young children. Both my daughters started crying when Jasmin's eyes and tounge turn into a snake. The begged me to turn if off - which I did.  They were so upset they couldn't sleep. We spent an hour trying to console them. My oldest daughter kept asking why Disney would make something so horrible. Disney just lost a loyal customer!!!!,1156204800,,476,4.471264367816092
2254246,2,B0007Z9R5M,"My little girl loves anything with the Disney Princesses, so for Christmas we bought her a large set of the dvds.  Last night, we finally got around to opening this particular one and I could not believe how low quality it was.  I really wanted to like it  because I think Disney had a good opportunity with the ""beauty from within"" theme, but the Jasmine story was completely inappropriate.  They could have done this so many other ways.  But a snake?  It isn't even so much that Jasmine turns into a snake...it is the look on her face and the scary eyes and tongue.  The worst part of all of it is when she hisses at and turns on Aladdin.  Now every time our daughter sees Jasmine in anything, she says, ""Ew[...]""  Thanks a lot for ruining one of my little girl's favorite things for her!  They know these Princess movies are especially loved by the tiny princesses in their audience, so why scare away your target crowd???  Someone at Disney really dropped the ball on this one.  On a happier note, however...we all love the other princess dvds, especially the Enchanted Tea Party.  Don't be afraid to try the others.",1148688000,5,1120,4.512437810945274
2254247,1,B0007Z9R5M,"My daughter is now into the Disney princess thing, and we thought this video might be a nice expansion of the disney universe based on the three ""princesses"" mentioned on the cover: Ariel, Cinderella, and Jasmine. Turn out this is yet another rush job from disney to take people's money away.

Disney is a marketing juggernaut and they've figured out that their characters have such strong appeal that merchandising them in many ways is immensely profitable. And I don't blame them. However, this includes releasing countless numbers of DVDs aimed at the children that are really nothing more than mixing and splices of previous cartoons. In the disney princess series, it's basically a focus on the female characters from different movies.

This DVD is #3 in the series and is themed ""the inner beauty"", a positive message, but in reality very loosely tied to the stories on this DVD.

The first story is about Arial, the Little Mermaid. This is a ""new"" cartoon (not splices of the movie) and clearly low budget animation; about on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon. The story is ok, and is about what I'd expet for this product. Arial, Sebastin, and Flounder return in this story and have an encounter with a magical ""blow fish"" which casts an bad spell on her, making bad things happen whenever she laughs. Long story short, she helps turn around the bad fish to be positive and laughter is once again safe to partake in. The most positive note was an original score about laughing by Sebastin along the same lines as ""Under the Sea"" score from the original The Little Mermaid.

The second story is about Cinderella who recaps her own story... which turns out to literally be splices of the movie Cinderella turned into video clips and video stills bordered by a cheasy graphic border. Seriously, nothing new is added other than a womans voice that sounds like Cinderella summary narrating her own story. My 2.5 year old daughter, whose favorite movie happens to be Cinderella, actually got bored with this, as the original movie Cinderella is so much better. It seemed like even she was thinking, ""what's the point?""

The third story is about Jasmine. Essentially a further adventures cartoon, this one is poorer quality than the Arial one and REALLY reaks of a bad Saturday morning cartoon. This one is about Jasmine encountering an evil spirit who tricks her into taking a magic potion (salve) that takes away her outward beauty by turning her into a huge cobra snake, but of course Aladdin loves her anyways and true love prevails. This one is downright creepy and scary, especially for my 2.5 year old. Disney could have written a story accomplishing the same thing without the demons and freakishly scary cobra-Jasmine. At one point, snake-Jasmine actually poisons Aladdin accidentally with one of her many sharp spines and he almost dies. What were they thinking?!? This is a PRINCESS VIDEO yet this story is so dark and sinister, and left me with a really bad taste.

I'm extremely disappointed with this video. I had expected a more light hearted and dreamy and at least original story expansions about the three princesses, and instead they gave us Saturday morning cartoon about Arial (with a reasonable attempt at a new score), a ridiculous splice and dice of the original Cinderella movie (and if you already own Cinderella, this 2nd story is pointless), and a freakish dark story involving Jasmine and Aladdin.

We have other Disney videos besides the Classics including Disney Christmas specials, and even the ""education"" series (which was a splice and dice itself). But this Princess #3 stories was not only a splice and dice, the end result is horrible and doesn't even follow the Princess theme very well at all. Big thumbs down on this one and I hope no one else wastes their money on it.",1141084800,30,3816,4.834609494640122
2254248,4,B0007Z9R5M,Our 3 and 5 year old princess-obsessed girls love this volume-especially the one with Jasmine where she turns into a snake.  They are thrilled by the contrast and really get the message that beauty is within.  They enjoyed being fearful in the beginning and we put it away.  they asked for it and watch it repeatedly.,1139011200,2,317,4.625
2254249,1,B0007Z9R5M,"My mother purchased this for my four year old, princess-obsessed daughter. We had to stop watching during the third story, a bizarre and disturbing anime-type piece in which Jasmine turns into a snake, since my daugther was CRYING and TOO FRIGHTENED to continue watching. I comforted her and assured her that Jasmine was OK at the end. She asked me, ""Mommy, Why did they make this for children?"" I really have no answer for that. Disney seems to have grown so greedy for cash from Princess-related products that they are not doing ANY quality control. If I had the money, I would send a copy of this to each member of the Board of Directors of the company so that they can see what kind of garbage is being released in the Disney name. My daughter wants to send this DVD to Mickey and ask him why they would make such a terrible thing for children. I doubt we would get an answer, but at least this review (and the others) may keep other kids from being exposed to this awful film.",1136246400,14,981,4.395604395604396
