5907800,5,B00EE6C4CI,This was one of the funniest parody movies I have ever seen. Whomever made it really needs to  make a couple more.,1386892800,8,114,4.181818181818182
5907801,5,B00EE6C4CI,"I rate films on how well I enjoy them and not on their quality. There were scenes which admittedly had me ROFL. The film does not only satire ""The Hunger Games"" but also satires other films as well as modern society, an aspect which I liked. The humor was indeed stupid and even crude at times. One line from the film about a past game:

""No one could anticipate Oprah would eat all the other contestants.""

The speech given at the end by the Samuel L. Jackson character actor had me in tears. Maiara Walsh who played the star Kantmiss Evershot reminded me of Zooey Deschanel more than Jennifer Lawrence. The actual film is short as it has a sad 10 minute blooper reel at the end.

I enjoyed the film, it reminded me of ""Your Highness"" minus some of the crudeness. Other films spoofed include, Oz, Potter, LOTR, Avatar, Avengers, Expendables, plus more.

Parental Guide: No F-bombs, but does have a lot of adult language. Censored sex scene. Male streaker with rear nudity.",1386460800,43,973,4.574712643678161
5907802,4,B00EE6C4CI,Good take off on what I considered a great set of books. This not the kind of movie that I ever give a 5 star on general purposes as they are a make up of one liners,1386288000,5,165,3.4864864864864864
5907803,4,B00EE6C4CI,"As you can probably tell from the title, this is NOT the big-budget adaptation of the hit YA book starring Jennifer Lawrence.  This is actually a spoof of that series, and I have to admit that its a pretty good one.  From what Ive read and heard, most people either love or hate spoofs...theres not much gray area in between.  For me, I enjoy them for the most part and will continue to watch them as long as they're made.  Although not perfect, THE STARVING GAMES is a fun spoof, chocked full of quirky gags and raunchy humor.

I suppose I should preface this review by stating this:  if you don't like stupid humor, then don't watch this film.  You will hate it.  But if you like oddball comedy, like Monty Python or Benny Hill, then you should definitely give this one a look.

THE STARVING GAMES is not really low-budget (IMDB estimates the budget at $4.5 million), but it won't win any awards for elaborate special effects or set designs.  That is part of the films allure, though.  Many of the gags and jokes would simply fall flat if more realism had been put into the film.

But although I found this film entertaining, it does have a few flaws.  For example, some of the attempts at humor are simply not funny.  Toilet humor is way overdone in this day and age, and it surprises me that directors still resort to it.  It fails here.

Still, THE STARVING GAMES does not pretend to be anything other than a zany, homage-bending ode to many recent staples in cinematic pop culture.  Many movies are spoofed here, not just THE HUNGER GAMES.  I particularly enjoyed seeing THE EXPENDABLES show up, and the actor that did the Sylvester Stallone impersonation is amazing.

This film will not be for everyone, but if you enjoy the SCARY MOVIE franchise, then put this one on your list.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1386115200,20,1838,4.495468277945619

5907860,5,B00EE6C4CI,"From the folks who brought you Meet the Spartans, Vampires Suck, Epic Movie, etc., now comes The Starving Games - a deliciously humorous spoof of The Hunger Games (and a few other recent films) that can actually stand on its own merits.  The casting is impeccable and spot on. Indeed - the female lead claims to have actually gone to the tryouts for the original Hunger Games only to find out that the role had already gone to Jennifer Lawrence. In her own words, ""things had now come full circle since this is the part she played in The Starving Games"". From the casting to the costumes, names, makeup, and settings, one might think you were watching the real thing.  After watching The Hunger Games for the second time on TV only a few days earlier, I couldn't stop laughing.  The Starving Games may be a parody but it is also a positive nod to THG.

From the very beginning, when ""Kantmiss"" volunteers to take her sister's place in the games, to her arrival in the Capital, her way of hiding from or dispatching her opponents, her budding romance with Peter Marlarkey (how appropriate the name alteration) played by the adorable Cody Christian of Pretty Little Liars fame, the laughs and action proceed at a rapid pace. When the two take refuge in a cave, fall asleep side by side, only to wake up surrounded by a sexually letching Hobbit and his leader, is truly an hysterical moment. Or when ""Kantmiss"" is told to cut down a hive of bugs on top of her enemies sleeping soundly on the ground below and her aim is not quite accurate; or when the exotic design of the Games master's beard keeps changing and even incorporates a Starbucks logo; or when Kantmiss's home boyfriend (played by the quite handsome Brant Daughtery also from PLL) gets so jealous that he physically invades the soundstage where The Starving Games is being filmed; and on and on. Even The Avengers takes a hit. The ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson who (along with Liam Neeson) seems to appear in every other movie (and even alludes to that apparent observation) comes across as a cursing latrine sergeant especially when he turns his thunder on Hawkeye who resents the possibility that Kantmiss might replace him among the Avengers.  The Expendables (played by some of the best look-alikes Hollywood has to offer) doesn't escape either.

The joy and fun of The Starving Games is the fact that it can make you laugh without being disrespectul or nasty.  It does what many of us might think or like to say but can't - as in the fiery dress of Kantmiss that nearly burns her to a crisp but does nothing but wow the crowd in THG. I highly recommend this film to anyone who needs a good laugh and will get plenty without having to get a headache from a noisy action film soundtrack or trying to figure out the nonsense of the latest sci-fy movie. Enjoy it even more with your favorite beverage.  One caveat: It is rated as a PG-13 movie but is much closer to an R.",1427241600,5,2931,4.537878787878788

There are appearances by the Harry Potter kids, Avatar characters, and The Expendables in this movie all while poking fun at the Hunger Games.  The humor in this movie is definitely geared towards people who are fans of sports because we have the Capital's version of ESPN reporting on the games constantly.  The ending was awesome and I wish that Katniss did to Peta what Kantmiss did to Peter in this movie!  Plus, having a half-time in the Hunger Games?  Genius!

The CGI is a little goofy, but the story is so funny and the acting is great that you will absolutely love this movie!

The Wizard of Oz is the first reference gag they went with), Facebook (TWICE!), Honey Boo Boo, Mel Gibson, Lady Gaga, The Most Interesting Man in the World, Nicki Minaj, and 16 and Pregnant. The jokes are weak and predictable (example: everyone is always really hungry so there's an unimaginative food gag every couple of minutes) and the formulaic approach to spoofing is at it's most obvious. I don't expect Shakespeare when I watch things like this. I expect some campy, dumb jokes and mindless schtick. I KNOW that it's meant to be stupid. But the goal is to be stupid in a WITTY way and make people laugh, not ANGRY and the longer I watched, the angrier I got. Lazy, thrown-together garbage like this is overtly insulting.  It's as if the producers said ""screw it. People who watch this crap are so utterly STUPID, they'll laugh at ANYTHING."" The Starving Games is very nearly as bad as the Wayans' Meet the Spartans.

It's bizarre, lame, and funny at the same time.  I mean, any time a movie can go back-to-back-to-back with Fruit Ninja, Annoying Orange, and Words with Friends (then Siri), that's some creativity.  Spoofs are all over the map, from movies like Avatar and Sherlock Holmes, music like Gangnam Style and Taylor Swift, and throw in a Hardee's (Carl's Jr. for you west coast folks) commercial to boot.  The Hunger Games is just a reference point for this movie to meander from one thing to another, related or not.

As with Vampires Suck, they try to hard to follow the plot of the original, with a half-hearted attempt at comedy inserted in. The actors clearly needed the work, because they were phoning in their performances. Which ultimately defeated the whole purpose, because they completely failed to make a laugh-worthy parody of the Hunger Games.

Perhaps we were supposed to giggle whenever #^*+ was tossed out like a table scrap to a dog?

5908044,5,B00EE6C4CI,"One of the main criticisms (primarily by ""Hunger"" stalking fanatics) of this parody/spoof is that it is crude and of low quality, but to me I found it spot-on-appropriate given that it's source of inspiration is ""The Hunger Games"". Remember ""Hunger"" is produced to sell with it's eye-candy actors, simplistic plot & dialogue for the broadest marketable audience - those with a functioning 9-10th grade literacy level; unchanged even as they age.
""Starving"" exposed all the dialogue, acting, set and action sequences for what they really are - improbable dumbness scene after scene.
""Starving"" even tossed in a few gibes at similar audience favorites, e.g. those ""Expendables"" super badasses; those Marvel superheroes; Taylor Swift; Potter and a few other guest spoofs. All equal opportunity funning in a ""Monty Python"" sort of way.
Even the cross media ""Angry Birds"" and ""Fruit Attack"" apps turning into real bird/fruity attacks were a totally hilarious surprise.
Sure there were some basic slapstick improbabilities (breadstick arrow); some brief crudeness (a streaker) scene.
Most poignant, in a ""Daily Show"" way of exposure, is Starving's burlesques of the whole ""Hunger"" milieu - the hunt & kill sequences, the cameras, the basic scientifically impossible dome with it's computer controlled environment.

The pun work was spot-on or should I say ""Kant-miss"" on ""Every-shot"". So, ""Hunger"" fanatics,  watch this great parody to see ""Hunger"" for what it is.",1395360000,2,1458,5.390350877192983

5908065,1,B00EE6C4CI,"In the 1970's, Mel Brooks and Monty Python made spoof films a fixture in American movie theaters. In the years that have followed, we've even seen franchises like, Scary Movie, Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Superhero Movie, but when was the last time you saw a spoof that was actually any good? Because of my love of the Hunger Games, I actually gave it's spoof a chance and I'm sorry I did. There were a lot of things here that could have been made fun of, but they weren't. The film gets so desperate that they actually turn to Avatar, The Avengers, and the action star of the Expendables, to make the thing long enough to be a full length film. I understand that the purpose behind spoof films is to be so ridiculous, that people laugh at how stupid it is, but there is a point where it is so beyond stupid and childish, that no one finds it funny anymore. The Starving Games quickly crosses this line and doesn't go back. It's a comedy making fun of one of my favorite series of all-time, a series I know like the back of my hand, and I hardly laughed. The only thing this film does well is cast actors who closely resemble the cast of the Hunger Games franchise. Beyond that, the acting is terrible, the jokes wouldn't even make children laugh, and the story is so out there, that eventually you're not even sure what they are doing. While spoofing big movies has become big business, this one does nothing but annoy everyone who was dumb enough to watch it.",1394496000,2,1461,4.375
