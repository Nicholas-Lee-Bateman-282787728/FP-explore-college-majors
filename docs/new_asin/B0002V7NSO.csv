8032153,5,B0002V7NSO,"Of course ,everyone has heard of Napoleon Bonapart. He was one of the greatest leaders in the 19th Century;and was responsible for France's Glory days. They may also know that he was exiled;but from there on what else they know is pretty scant. The problem with most people understanding history is simply because there is so much of it,over such a long period of time;and to further complicate it;attempts to teach it in school;seldom lead to anything but complete boredom.
 I read a lot of history and historical novels;but I must admit it is still difficult to remember things and the connections and timing. Perspective is everything in history;but how many can put Napoleon's era of greatness as the same time as The War of 1812 in America?
 This Biography  was created by the A&E Television Network and in a short time period of only 50 minutes,tells the life of Napoleon from birth to his death. In that short time ,by watching it you will get a good idea of Napoleon ,how he came to be the most important leader at his time ,what he accomplished and what led to his downfall.
 If you want to read about the life and times of Napoleon;I suggest you get this Boigraphy;and you will get a good understanding of the history of Europe at that time and the impact that Napoleon had on it.
 This Biography is so well done;that one could spend many,many hours in a classroom or reading history text books;and not get anywhere as much understanding of Napoleon as one would get from this video. It would also make an excellent reference reminder.",1261008000,6,1545,4.644688644688645
8032154,5,B0002V7NSO,"The biography of Napoleon gives an account of the life and times of this remarkable man, from his early youth to his final days. This is a good representation of the highlights of his life. Although some important details are missing, this is a good explanation of his achievements and failures.

Napoleon rose very quickly in the army, his obvious brilliance having been noticed and having been critical for the success of the French armies against monarchist forces trying to destroy the French revolution and restore the monarchy. Napoleon was clearly a great military genius and a very dynamic personality. He had an incredible drive to succeed with a charismatic personality. His meteoric rise to the top is impressive.

I learnt of the incredible energy that the great emperor had. For example, he was directly involved in many details of government and at times dictating correspondence until his secretaries collapsed from exhaustion.

Napoleon had a deep and genuine affection for Josephine, often writing her detailed and interesting letters from the battle front. Since she could not bear him male heirs to the throne, Napoleon had to divorce her and married someone else.

The biography captures the grandeur of Napoleon, his zeal for war, his love for Josephine and his limitless energy that drove him beyond what even he could achieve.

One of Napoleon's greatest failures was the invasion of Russia with a huge army, which was consumed by the vast Russian landmass and atrocious weather.

A well produced account of this spectacular man that is well worth viewing by anyone with an interest in history or the Napoleonic wars.",1151193600,10,1640,5.078066914498141
8032155,1,B0002V7NSO,"See, I'm a history fan. I know everything French. I feel frustrated when I finished watching this video. It's not much more than some still pictures with no professional-level narration. It's a cheap show, not history. Can't believe it's from A&E. However, I understand. It could be an issue of money. Fund they have doesn't allow the makers of this movie to replay the history in a thorough and precise way. Sigh ... Who will pay for history study nowadays? None.",1056499200,4,464,4.7407407407407405
8032156,4,B0002V7NSO,"I hail Napoleon Bonaparte as having been a truly recgonized conqueror of modern times. A&E'e Biographly did help to clear- up some points, that I had failed to fully understand during my reading about him. I was hoping to learn more about his General's i.e was it true about their betrayal of him? All in all, I think it was a well produce portrait, of one of the three greatest men in all the history of this world.
