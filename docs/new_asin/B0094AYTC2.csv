8535780,5,B0094AYTC2,Better band than most of Joe Bonamassa's solo projects. Tight band interplaying like they have been playing together for years. Wondered where Joe came from before seeing him on PBS? This is it!!!,1442448000,,196,4.96969696969697
8535781,5,B0094AYTC2,Great stuff,1424044800,,11,5.0
8535782,5,B0094AYTC2,With Joe Bonamassa how can you go wrong. With Glenn Hughes pipes and Jason Bonhams stickwork you'll be off your seat the whole cd,1387843200,,129,4.416666666666667
8535783,5,B0094AYTC2,If you like Deep Purple or Zepplin you will love this.  I hear all the hype of this being the last one but They are to good nor to do more.  I heard this was a rushed project.  I look forward to what they can do when they have lots of time.,1357862400,,240,3.576923076923077
8535784,4,B0094AYTC2,"These guys know how it's done. This is the way bands should operate today. Like they did in the 70's. My only complaint is that Joe B sings on only one song and it's a duet. But it is an excellent song. I would have given it about 4.25 stars, but it doesn't allow for partial stars. I hope this band continues on. We need more of them like these guys.",1355443200,,351,3.9577464788732395
