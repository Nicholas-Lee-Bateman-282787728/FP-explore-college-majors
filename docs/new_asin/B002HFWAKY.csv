3928475,1,B002HFWAKY,"Despite a spy hopping orca on the cover, an orca on the bind, a photo of an orca in action on the back of the DVD case and an orca printed on the DVD itself, there is not one orca featured in this movie. Not even one.

I was expecting something different.",1282694400,2,255,3.9038461538461537
3928476,4,B002HFWAKY,"Good DVD with some good views on whales, and the human efforts around them (both good and bad).

Roger Payne is a good host, if a little idealistic.

Two issues though....

1) Patrick Stewart does not host this DVD, Roger Payne does, with narration by a woman who's name I can't recall right now.

2) Despite the images on the front and back of this box, there are NOT any Orcas (Killer Whales) in this DVD.

Though that this should be pointed out.",1262563200,26,448,4.349397590361446
3928477,3,B002HFWAKY,"I bought this DVD for my toddler since he loves whales. He loves Free Willy and Disney Nature Earth footage on humpback whales but he did not enjoy this dvd, I think because there were no killer whales in it. I assumed there would be since the front cover has one. Also not a lot of footage on dolphins. Just not what we expected but I guess it can be very educational.",1253664000,3,369,4.138888888888889

8370301,2,B002HFWAKY,Kind of disapoointed that I purchased this DVD since it had an Orca Whale on the cover. I was looking forward to watch the portion of the Orcas in the movie but unfortunatly I didn't see a single Orca throughout the whole movie. If your going to put an Orca on the cover at least have a portion of the movie dedicated to Orcas. Otherwise I thought the movie was very informative and well narrated :),1342396800,12,399,4.2631578947368425
8370302,5,B002HFWAKY,"My 5 year old grandson is studying whales in school, so I sent him this DVD.  He watched it with his dad and his dad was so impressed that his son was able to connect what he was learning at school with the DVD.  Little 3 year old brother loved the DVD too.
An extra bonus is that Amazon makes these DVDs affordable for everyone, including GRANDMAS!",1330473600,2,349,4.1940298507462686
