5731297,5,B00CNIDHM0,This movie is well worth the purchase for anyone who loves monkeys. It has a great moral that I will keep to myself and allow you to experience for yourself.,1377302400,2,157,4.266666666666667
5731298,4,B00CNIDHM0,This is a really good movie. It has all the elements that goes into a horror movie and all are executed well. Great movie to check out on a rainy night with your snacks and a good lounge chair or comfy bed.  Worth every minute,1375142400,2,226,4.022222222222222
5731299,2,B00CNIDHM0,"After a quick glimpse of our flying monkey, the film opens with graduation in Gale, Kansas. Dad (David Kranig) was once again late for his daughter Joan's (Maika Monroe) event. This time it was graduation. So being the loving dad that he is, he makes up for it by throwing money at the issue and buys her a monkey from the local pet store that deals in illegal animals.

From the subplot in China we discover this is not an ordinary monkey, but one that turns into a flying demon at night with special effects that made be think of the harpies from ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Now the kicker is that this F-ing monkey demon can not be killed with ordinary weapons, but only those blessed in China 1000's of years ago. (I love it when bad plots collide.) Now how many of those do you find in gun crazy Gale, Kansas? Oh BTW, the monkey has taken a shine to Joan.

I think you see where this is going.

Part of the film is shown through a monkey's eye view which used a special distorted lens and a blue filter, most likely because we have grown tired of red filters. The special effects weren't so special. It was apparent the actors didn't get serious about the script, suspecting Oscar nominations would be limited.

A border line rental.

5731301,3,B00CNIDHM0,"I'm almost embarrassed to say I like it.  It was a different and offbeat storyline and just a B flick, but I found it entertaining and actually enjoyed it.  A cute little monkey is bought and brought home.  Actually it is the last one left of a rare demon breed that at night turns into a blood thirsty flying killing machine.  It has to be done away with in a certain way or it comes back double and there are two.  Shoot the pair and there are four. Etc. etc.  Sort of ""don't get the Gremlin wet"".  I guess they hooked me with the monkey.",1401062400,,540,4.085714285714285
5731302,5,B00CNIDHM0,"Although the acting in the film is good, and the characters are mostly pretty likeable, the films premise is hilariously stupid.  But, if you enjoy laughing at a film, you will find plenty here to amuse you.  My husband and I really like this one.  And there's only one make-out scene (tv style) to fast forward through, and one scene with a lot of cleavage as the victim bounces around trying to run away.",1397347200,3,406,4.45945945945946
5731303,5,B00CNIDHM0,I enjoyed this movie because it was different.  Who would ever think of a flying monkey.  Again it was action throughout the movie and to me it was interesting to see where they would go with this movie.  The acting was good and everyone held their own.  I had seen a few of the actors in other movies and that is one of the reasons I chose this movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone into monkeys or any killer animals for that matter.  It's all in fun!,1397174400,4,462,4.134831460674158
5731304,1,B00CNIDHM0,"The Syfy channel  puts out some really stupid, cheezy, low-budget, poorly acted, idiotically stupid plotlined  movies among the occasional burst of entertaining lunacy like Sharknado.  This one is in the former category.  It's an hour and 24 minutes of my life I will never get back.  I can't even imagine what is motivating these (astoundingly) positive reviews.  You've been warned.",1395878400,,384,5.316666666666666
5731305,3,B00CNIDHM0,"FLYING MONKEYS

I absolutely love SyFy and their movies, there is nothing like a good rainy night at home watching these flicks. Now when I first had seen something about this movie I thought it had something to do with the Wizard of Oz. I know SyFy had made the very entertaining Tin Man and thought this was something like that. As it turns out it is very much not Oz related despite evil flying monkeys.

Kayley Dante has just graduated from high school and her dad did not make it on time to see it. While upset it is not a surprise to her as she has come to expect this from him. What she did not expect is how he would make it up to her. It turns out that he bought her a new pet, a monkey. What they both didn't know is that said monkey changes at night and grows into a killer with wings, a flying monkey.

This is your typical SyFy channel movie so don't expect a classic but it is a cool little flick. The acting is good and the story is fun, plus the cg isn't bad for a TV flick. Sure there is some outrageous stuff and the two hunters are laugh out loud funny but that is what makes it. First time director Robert Grasmere and first time writer Silero Gouris have created a cool little SyFy flick that you can tell could have been something more if not for budget.

Now I am not saying this is a great movie but it certainly is one of the more entertaining SyFy flicks I have seen recently. I still think this could have been a cool title for some horror Oz type film. Regardless this is good enough for a watch on a boring night. Like I said before them hunters are hilarious for all the wrong reasons [or maybe that was purposely] plus flying monkeys kill people, come on what is not to like about that.",1393891200,6,1717,4.101190476190476
5731306,5,B00CNIDHM0,"With so many bafta award winning films under his belt Robert Grasmere
has not disappointed with this incredible, spectacular, blockbuster
hit.

Flying monkeys is an instant classic taking inspiration from Alien and
the work of William Shakespeare.

The writing is exceptional including such memorable phrases as 'point
shoot' 'it's dying time' and 'get of my porch you stupid ass monkey'

Flying monkeys will be studied 60 000 years from now in film schools
across the galactic empire. Any film maker will look to the mother of
all monkey related films Robert Grasmere as their soul inspiration.

If you haven't watch this yet your soul will not move on after you pass
away. Watch this now or live in eternal fear of the endless darkness of
the abyss and your potential heart attack at ANY SECOND.

5731308,3,B00CNIDHM0,"This movie steals from The Wizard of Oz, Gremlins, and Jeepers Creepers. And to top it off it is a ""SyFy Channel Movie"". Normally that is the kiss of death. But this one is actually not that bad. The story is decent. The acting is decent. And the CGI monkeys are decent. But some how the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It just sort of works....against all odds!!! Bought the DVD for under $5 so I am keeping it and will watch it again some time.

This is a REALLY bloody movie.
It doesn't have the quality SFX/CGI
of a mega-bucks blockbuster, but---
by golly!---you GET the bang for your bucks!

I r-e-a-l-l-y L=O=V=E the schlocky movies
you see on The SyFy Channel. If you have
a bucket of microwave popcorn and a sugary
drink---with alcohol... or beer---you have a ""B""
movie just as good as KOMODO; NEVER CRY

LAND SHARK; RELIC; HYDRA, and dozens of
o-t-h-e-r discs in MY collection.

TRY it; you'll like it... if you're old enough to've
sat in the front row of triple features--- with four
cartoons/'Stooges' shorts in the 'fifties.

Great stuff; fair price.",1406764800,,664,5.073394495412844
8583808,4,B00CNIDHM0,"The plot is pretty rudimentary, a disengaged widower raising a daughter misses her high school graduation and feels that a pet monkey would make a terrific ""I'm sorry"" gift.  (I would rather have a car, but that's just me.)  The monkey, of course, isn't as cute and cuddly as expected.  When nighttime comes the itty bitty monkey morphs into a cartoonish killer winged terror with an appetite for meat.  The caveat that didn't come with this adorable pet was a manual on the care and feeding of said demon beastie and the small print that says if you kill one you end up with two (a bargain at any price).  Naturally, the local yokels are all trigger happy and armed to the teeth.  Soon killer monkeys are popping up all over the place.  To no one's surprise, there's also a team of demon hunters hot on the trail of this poor misunderstood simian.  And thank goodness, they have blessed weapons!

First of all, there wasn't much of a turnout for this graduation so I don't know why the daughter got peeved.  Second, she found the perfect means of dealing with a two-timing boyfriend.  Lastly, the demon monkey Skippy actually liked her and considering her lousy attitude, she could have used all the friends she could get her hands on (especially as she was losing the rest at an alarming rate).  I don't imagine they'll be much of a reunion for that class.

This is such a dopey movie I couldn't hate it if I tried (I tried).  Best scene: ""Scotty the pizza kid, they swarmed him, ate him.......the pizza's still warm!""  Yes, I know, this movie will give winged monkeys a bad name.  Sorry about that.  Shoddy FX and bargain basement acting aside, I thought it was a hoot.  But it's still crap.",1403740800,5,1694,4.534653465346534
