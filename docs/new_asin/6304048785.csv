765939,5,6304048785,"This collection contains seven of Ken Burns' shorter documentary works that range from his early days as a film maker to those that show him at the height of his craft.  While ""The Brooklyn Bridge"" is rather  weak, the other six films more than make up for it.  Truly an excellent  showcase for Burns.  See below for a review of each film in this  collection.
""The Brooklyn Bridge: Running Time:  60 minutes Narrated  by David McCullough
Although parts of ""The Brooklyn Bridge""  hint at the excellent work Ken Burns would produce in later films, this  particular documentary falters in its last 20 minutes.
The Brooklyn  Bridge is many stories, but it's mainly the tale of how perseverance can  make an almost impossible vision take form.  The Bridge took many years and  several million dollars to build.  It faced political and social  opposition.  It weathered scandals and corruption.  And when it was over,  it stood as a monument to mechanical brilliance and souful aspirations.  Burns only spends forty minutes on the story of the Bridge's construction.  He spends the last 20 minutes focusing on what the Bridge means to various  scholars, poets and New Yorkers; this is where the film lags. Admittedly,  the Bridge is important as a cultural icon, not just for New York, but for  America.  However, if Burns was going to devote this much time to  testimonials, then the film should have been at least 90 minutes or, better  yet, two hours.
When the film concentrates on the Bridge's construction,  it shines.  Burns has carefully selected photos, drawings, contemporary  newspaper accounts and personal journals of key participants in the  Bridge's inception to vibrantly tell this story.  He just should have spent  more time on his subject.  The pace of this documentary is so hurried and  awkward, you can tell where Burns is skipping key parts of the story in  order to get to the testimonials.  A good effort, but it pales before his  later output.
""The Statue of Liberty"" Running Time:  60 minutes  Narrated by David McCullough
""The Statue of Liberty"" by Ken  Burns is a moving testament to the spirit of the American ideal. Like  Burns' earlier ""Brooklyn Bridge,"" this film also chronicles the  construction of an American landmark as well as the reactions of various  people to what that landmark stands for. Unlike the ""Brooklyn  Bridge,"" however, this approach works in ""The Statue of  Liberty."" What the Statue means to one person or another is part of  its importance, and Burns has captured that beautifully.
Using wonderful  footage, sketches, photos and personal accounts of its construction, Burns  ably documents the struggle to make a vision a reality. Burns well captures  the engineering brilliance required to build the Statue. He also  illustrates how the Statue has become a representation of the best and  worst of our American ideals. The Statue is a symbol of new hope and second  chances, and this film illuminates the power of that symbol.
""The  Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God""  Running Time:  60 minutes  Narrated by David McCullough
In ""The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts  to God"" Ken Burns truly hit his stride as a documentarian. By  combining personal journals of early Shakers, historic and social  commentary of scholars and contemporaries, and wonderfully insightful  interviews with present day Shakers, Burns tells a simple story, but tells  it beautifully. By illustrating the Shaker life and ideology, Burns  presents a group of dedicated people who strove to put God into every  aspect of their lives.
If you know the Shakers for only their furniture  and ritual dancing, then this film will illuminate your understanding of  early America's most powerful Utopian movement.
""Thomas Hart  Benton"" Running Time:  60 minutes Narrated by Jason  Robards
""Thomas Hart Benton"" is a revealing and immensely  watchable biography of an artist who probably reached more Americans than  any other. As Ken Burns ably proves, Benton's work captured the spirit and  history of the average American man and woman.
Combining samples of  Benton's work, interviews with art critics, family, friends and enemies as  well as footage of Benton himself, Burns presents a perfectly balanced  approach to an artist's life and his statement of America as a struggling,  vibrant land.
You don't have to like Benton's art to like this film. In  fact, several of the critics Burns interviewed for this one-hour  documentary dismiss Benton as a serious artist. However, what they say  about Benton is as revealing as the praise of critics who revere him.  Perfectly balanced and entertaining.  ""Empire of the Air""  Running Time:  120 minutes Narrated by Jason Robards
 Although Marconi  may have invented the technology for radio, three men made it a force for  change. ""Empire of the Air"" examines the lives of those men, Lee  de Forest, Edwin Armstrong and David Sarnoff. All three would contribute  some necessary component to radio's development, but could never agree or  acknowledge the work of the other.
Today we take radio's constant  presence and role for granted, but this documentary proves what a struggle  it was to bring it into being. Burns uses personal interviews with the key  players in radio's development and their contemporaries, as well as  archival footage and historical commentary to illustrate how radio has  impacted us as a society. The story of radio's three primary  ""fathers"" plays like a radio drama full of struggle, triumph and  tragedy. This is an outstanding documentary.
""Huey Long""  Running Time:  90 minutes Narrated by David McCullough
Although forgotten  or largely discounted today, Huey Long came closer to becoming a total  dictator than any other American.  This film by Ken Burns brings the power  and presence of Long into its proper context of a poor and desperate state  in the throes of a crippling depression.  Burns illustrates this  documentary with excellent interviews with Long's contemporaries,  constituents, friends and opponents.  There is also revealing footage of  Long himself that reflects his intended image of a ""countrified  buffoon,"" which caused his enemies to underestimate him.  This  doucmentary brings Long back to life as a veritable dictator who might have  won the presidency if not for his assassination.
The film's main strength  lies in its balanced approach to this controversial figure.  Although Burns  interviewed many of Long's enemies, he also sought the opinion of the  average Louisiana citizen who benefited from Long's provision of free  school books and hospital care.  These people were Long's source of  strength of power who still regard him as a great man and never cared how  Long managed to give them these things.  Again, Burns balances the man who  provided relief to a struggling people, and the dictator who compromised  decomcracy in order to provide that relief.  This is an excellent  documentary.
""The Congress"" Running Time:  90 minutes Narrated  by David McCullough
Ken Burns' ""The Congress"" is a wonderful  history of an essential but underrated American institution. In only ninety  minutes, Burns captures the strengths and weaknesses of our legislative  branch like few documentarians could. Congress, often accused of gridlock  and pork barrelling, actually exemplifies the American ideal of self-rule.  This film touches on key successes and failures of this body throughout its  entire history. Burns examines the contributions of such pivotal  congressmen as Joe Cannon, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, George Norris and a  host of others. Burns alters our current perspective of Congress to show us  an organization of great power that has, at times, ruled the country in  counterbalance to weak presidents.
Burns uses contemporary newspaper  accounts, archival footage, personal interviews, and journals to transform  Congress's history in a fascinating parade of men and women who represented  the best and worst of America. A great film.",959126400,67,7980,5.178881008668243
