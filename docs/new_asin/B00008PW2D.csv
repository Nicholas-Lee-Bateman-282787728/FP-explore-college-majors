1858677,5,B00008PW2D,"This four girls are simply fantastic and I can't really understand how can this year they're going to film the last season. I heard the reason is because Sarah Jessica Parker wants to have another baby and she wants to spend more time with her children. I'm happy for her but she could do both things as other artists do. HBO should make at least a Sex and the city movie.
The fifth season has a different direction because the girls had grown and they live different experiences like Miranda that now  has a son, Charlotte is getting divorce from Tray, Samantha felt in love for the second time in the series and she forgives her parter after that she discovers that he had cheated on her and finnaly Carrie, Carrie now is alone and she gets the change to write a book about her column.
The fifth season has only 8 episodes but they're are fuuny and intresting as always.",1050192000,17,872,4.416149068322981

1858800,2,B00008PW2D,"I'm binge watching the entire series (only took a decade and a half to catch up with the rest of the world) and the 1st 4 seasons did not dissappoint; the writing and acting were sharp, witty, and simultaneously unique and universal.  This season however is a departure from those traits.  It  seems written to shock, and is studded with hi-jinx and and cheap laughs.  The characters seem out of character rather than evolving. Also,  Carrie's hair and styling this season has taken a turn for the matronly, which is such an abrupt shift from her boho/downtown + Manolos style of last season. 8 episodes is 7 too many.  Let's hope the final season returns to good writing and leaves the cheap thrills behind like last years low-rise jeans",1480550400,5,738,4.682170542635659

When will you stop watching this crappy old show? I have to review it once a week. We may need a divorce, I can't stand seeing you watch this terrible show in my periphery and even when I'm away at work, I constantly get reminders to review it.

1859623,5,B00008PW2D,"Now that SATC is streaming free on Prime, can we get rid of all the reviews focusing on the price of the short season box set!  :  )  But, I tell you what, binge watching SATC is killing me.  6 seasons!  I can't do it.  Had to pause here at Season 5.  This show can really fill a void in one's life, if one finds oneself without close friends due to a job relocation or other life changing event.  It's like being the 5th person at the table during one of their brunches.  And, just waiting to see what whacky hairstyle/outfit Carrie is going to try on next makes the time spent so worth it.  I would, however, like to point out as someone who was raised Catholic:  I think it is unlikely a priest would allow a lawyer to dictate the terms of a baptism.  That's dramatic license, I guess.

More wreired fact is the price of season6, which is the twice than the other seasons. Maybe it is becuase the next season has more episodes. The price regulation is too greedy.

Carrie wasn't pregnant but it was obvious that Sara Jessica Parker was especially with the baggy cloths and only breast and head shots. The other characters were also in some type of boring state of mind.. Even Samantha wasn't feeling so hot anymore.. But all can not be perfect and season 5 isn't but I'm moving on to both parts of season six and although season 5 failed for me, it's still part of my collection and I love these women!

1859723,4,B00008PW2D,"I love Sex and the City. This however, probably my least favorite season. I did like it though, because it showed new courses for the girls, and the new struggles they're going through. Miranda with her new baby. Charlotte with her divorce. Carrie with spiraling through this single status, she refused to get out of. And Samantha, doing a 180, and loving someone other than herself. :) However , her storyline, was my LEAST favorite. She completely lost herself with Richard, then she took him back? Completely different from her old self, but then again, we must all fall to understand some things.

Season 2 was my favorite!",1401148800,,627,4.805555555555555

1859742,2,B00008PW2D,I have some issues with skipping. It is weird because these disks/package doesnt look wrong or damaged but there is something really wrong with it. The views are all off like it's really magnified and stretched (funny though cause this makes everyone look fat lol) and it wouldn't play a few disks.

1859800,5,B00008PW2D,"Probably the most controversial year of ""Sex and the City"", not because of the series itself, but for the fact that Home Box Office, the owners of the show, priced this season set the same as other sets, but with fewer episodes. Other season box sets usually had 18 episodes, but due to Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthis Nixon's real-life pregnancies only eight shows were filmed this year. Many have felt that HBO was really ripping people off because of the high-price of this set, but in all reality we as consumers can't really do anything but either choose to not buy the set or purchase it in order to finish your collection. Or you could purschase the ""Sex and the City: Complete Series"" set that is available.
 Nevertheless, although this season is short many stories are in full swing and the writing is crisp and sharp. This is the year, 2002, that Charlotte starts dating her attorney Harry, and continues to butt heads with Bunny over Charlotte's financial situation after her divorce; Carrie gets an offer to make a book out of her column and goes to California for the publishing of it where she meets Big; Samantha's affair with Richard goes south as she realizes she cannot trust him as far as other women goes; and Miranda battles being a new single mom and makes Carrie the Godmother of Brady.

1859814,4,B00008PW2D,"The fifth season of the vastly entertaining ""Sex and the City"" features eight funny, sexy, and occasionally poignant episodes of New York chic-ness.  In other words, if you've seen the previous seasons, there's no reason not to keep plowing ahead to the series' big close in season six (well, the big close until the movie that eventually followed).  And contrary to some of the comments here on Amazon, season five is indeed priced lower than the other seasons due to its shorter length.  To be fair, maybe the price reduction is a recent development.  In any event, you can use the money you save to help spring for a good Chardonnay to sip while watching the girls confront dating troubles, baby issues (Miranda's little Brady sure is a cutie, endless crier or not), and engage in a memorable debate about whether Nathan Lane's lounge act piano player is gay or not.

1859817,5,B00008PW2D,"i completely 100% love the fifth season of sex and the city. true it is extremely short and overpriced but the 8 episodes are pure gold. A lot of the reviewers bemoaned the fact that this season suffers from a lack of laughs and is more serious and the characters feel unlike themselves. I tell those reviewers to take a closer look at the end of season 4, the journeys and behaviours of the four leads is completely truthful and relatably to real life after where we left them last. They are all burnt out, they have all had there hearts broken yet again and now they have realised that they are no longer as young as they once were and therefore feel terrified by the fact that they are still alone. I felt most for Carrie in this season, true she acts selfish towards some of friends at times in this season but she is so afraid of what will happen next after all that has happened - the breakup with Aiden and the departure of Big, that she reverts completely into herself and attempts to keep her friends static around her, as is witnessed in 'Luck be an old lady'. The other characters too experiences emotions that are unlike anything that has come before them. As Charlotte points out ot Miranda in the previous season just before Brady's birth that 'she needs to start letting people in' Miranda feels the full force of that this season when she attempts to balance both her social life with her family life and like Carrie fears what will come next. Charlotte is forced to confront the fact that her Mister Perfect fantasy of a husband was not a fantasy but turned into a nightmare, and that she must finally look elsewhere for the love and intimacy she desires so much. Samantha feels she loses a part of her identity upon opening herself to Richard and being burnt because of it, but it is only when we fall down do we stand up and learn how to be stronger as she learns in the final episode.
This season represent a bridge between the fun wild days of the first four season and the more adult and mature world of the sixth season and movie. It also shows that to move on we must standup by ourselves and move forward into whatever murky future lies ahead because only through that do we grow as human beings.",1228089600,5,2221,4.380145278450363

1859820,5,B00008PW2D,"A short, but sweet season, I love the fun of season 5.

Of all the heavy relationships, serious issues, and ""true life"" this show tends to embody, season 5 is nice for its frivolity.

True it is shorter than any other season, but a savvy shopper can find it for a smaller price (if Amazon ever fails, try a video rental sale when they sell their former rentals)

The episodes make you happy to be a girl! ""Anchors Away"" is great, soo many boobs, all of them seen by Carrie (And what a great song in the end!).  ""Unoriginal Sin"" allows us to see the truly lawyer-ific side of Miranda, and she goes up against the ""desperate"" Catholic church, while Carrie must change the name of her column due to lack of activity: --- & the City.  ""Luck Be an Old Lady"" is great if only for it being Charlotte's ""thirty-faux"" birthday!  ""Cover Girl""  Carrie's head on Madonna's body as a mock up for her book cover, in addition to the ""taste"" difference between Carrie and Samantha in their clash over what is sexy makes this episode hilarious and we get the Amy Sedaris and Molly Shannon cameos!  ""Plus One ..."" a fun episode complete with Miranda's Freudian moment and Carrie's ""skinned: date, Samantha.  ""Critical Condition"" is a throw away episode ... Samantha and Miranda come to an understanding, Carrie freaks out about what she might have done to Aidan, and Charlotte refuses to take Bunny's harsh treatment ""lying down."" ""The Big Journey"" is great, just the beginning alone can be re-watched over and over: ""I need a man on top of me"" and the ""very 'Some Like It Hot'"" reference is hilarious.  But this episode is all about Carrie, no doubt.  ""I Love A Charade"" is a snoozer, but Charlotte steals the show with her new playmate, Harry ... unlikely and very entertaining.

1859845,3,B00008PW2D,"I think we can all agree from the reviews here, that Season 5 is not  a crowd pleaser.  Shooting was done around Sarah and Cynthia's real life pregnancies and this kind of spoilt it ... because Carrie looks pregnant throughout this season, and we all know her character is opposed to having a child.  As a result, she wears the most ridiculous costumes in this Season to try to hide it, which does not match her usual fashionable style.  You have to wonder why filming wasn't just put on hold.
Despite this, the season has its rewarding episodes out of the eight on offer.  IN particular, when Charolotte meets Harry, and Sam's vibrator.

The biggest problem with this season is that it is quite depressing, and none of the characters seem to want to be there.  Fortunately, the fun atmosphere picks up again in time for Season 6.  AS another reviwer pointed out, you can almost skip Season 5 and go straight to Season 6.",1147219200,,921,4.539393939393939

However, the character development was fabulous, especially with Cynthia Nixon's portrayal of Miranda as a new mother. I laughed, I felt sympathy, my jaw dropped in shock and occasional horror, and I feel that despite its brevity, Season 5 is just as good as the rest of them.",1143417600,3,563,4.320754716981132
1859847,4,B00008PW2D,"Yes, I agree with everyone who is upset at HBO / AOL / Time Warner for charging so much for this season.  It's a rip-off...no question.  (Let's not even start on the dividing of Season 6 into 2 parts!)

But it's interesting to me to see how much anger about the price/value has spilled into vitriolic evaluations of this season.  To me, it was the first time in awhile that the characters moved in believable directions.  Samantha opened herself up to commitment and heartbreak...and in a way only Samantha could do!  Miranda dealt with motherhood and her VERY ambiguous feelings towards it.  I liked very much the way she went from barely paying attention to her baby to finding satisfaction in loving her child and caring for him (too bad she named him ""Brady"").  I also like the constant evolution of her feelings toward Steve.  Charlotte works on coming to terms with failure, not only of her marriage, but of her whole ""game plan"" for life...marrying a nice, well-off professional, have kids, etc.

Carrie is always the problematic character.  Her treatment of the important men in her life, particularly Aidan, has made her a tough person to care about.  She's witty...no doubt, and it's always fascinating to see what horrific or wonderful outfit she'll be wearing next.  I was relieved to see so little of Big in this season.  I guess I'm the only one who always found their relationship lacking...they brought out the worst in each other more than they brought out the best.

The season was made a little uncomfortable by Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy.  It forced her to wear some awful things, and the directors of the show still insisted on lots of full body shots of her.  I remember a shot in the season finale, during the wedding reception.  She's standing there, looking pensive, and for some reason, instead of a close up (or even medium close-up), we got a full shot, and the poor thing looked awful.  And she looks tired and overly made up throughout the season.  It's not her fault...I'm thrilled she had a baby...but the shows producers (which include Parker, ironically) didn't do Parker or Carrie any favors.

But the season is packed with highlights.  The vibrating chair stuff is very funny.  The trip to Atlantic City was fun.  The entire season finale was a treat, with everyone perplexed at Nathan Lane's character.

And the acting and writing was superb as always.  All four leads did very well, and excellent support was offered all around (although I was disappointed that Molly Shannon and Amy Sedaris weren't given more to do as Carrie's publishers).  Candice Bergen was amusing, and Frances Sternhagen makes a brief but memorable appearance as Bunny.  I was glad to see Office Space's Ron Livingston, and look forward to his character's arch in Season 6.

So, if you don't want to spend full price on this set (I don't blame you) spring for used copies on Amazon or at online auction sites.  It's essential SEX... viewing!!",1140566400,5,2959,4.790513833992095
1859848,3,B00008PW2D,"I am a huge fan of this show and I was excited to get season 5.  Only when I opened it and only found 2 dvds with only 8 shows I was quite disappointed!!  Especially since the season costs just as much as the other ""complete"" seasons.

Aside from being ripped off - it is still a pretty good season. Be warned though - It is very different from all the other seasons.  The girls change.  The focus is not on the girls and dating - but rather focusing on singlehood and the characters analzing themselves a bit more.  Its different.  Something happens to Carrie - She becomes very cynical after her breakup with Adian and Big leaving.  Things change - the focus is on Miranda's baby, Samantha getting over Richard, and Charotte finding love again after Trey.

Maybe we are missing Big and Adian - as well as the other half of the season.  I recommend getting the season if you are someone striving to own the complete series, as I am.  If not you would probably be better off renting this season.  With only 8 epidsodes it won't take you that long at all!",1140393600,,1054,4.321428571428571
1859849,4,B00008PW2D,"i love this series, especially the coffee shop scenes. they are hilarious everytime. the first time i watched season 5, i was very disappointed. i thought it was terrible. but then i watched it again and now i LOVE it! miranda's story with the baby offers HILARIOUS instances to be funny, like when her cat eats the baby's belly button and such. her and steve are so cute together. and i love kristin davis in the season as well. her character is so good even after going through a divorce and still hoping for true love. kim cattrall, as always, is excellent, and the samanatha/richard storyline gave her a chance to be a normal woman for once, not someone who has wild and crazy casual sex all the time without falling for the guy. because, believe me, NO WOMAN can do that for very long without feeling SOMETHING.

i do like carrie but this season she really pissed me off. it seems that the more i watch this show, the more her character bugs me. carrie is so self-involved, especially in this season, that i can't understand why any of the girls would want to be friends with her. i know the show is centered around carrie and her 3 friends, but for ONCE, couldn't they have NOT made it ""all about carrie?"" especially the episode where miranda has the baptism and asks carrie to be the godmother... where has carrie EVER shown that she would make a good guardian for a child? even she says it herself that she never thought she was very maternal. and i can't stand how, after everything miranda has going on in her life (her NEWBORN CHILD, her career, sleep deprivation), how she can still empathize and listen to carrie babble on about aidan and their mistakes, when she's already overplayed them so many times before? carrie, take a hint... @ least miranda's got real problems.

1859869,4,B00008PW2D,"This season is quite different from the others, in part because of its brevity, and also because of the tone of the season. As has been noted, the show had to work around Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy, but they managed to handle it O.K. I actually like Season 5 a lot more than Season 4 or 6. Miranda seems intelligent again, after being pathetic for so long, and her baby-raising lines are hilarious. Charlotte is at her best, alternating between her sweet, charming demeanor and her attempts to recover from her disastrous marriage and Bunny. Samantha seems too aged in this season, though, and Carrie annoys me, as always. In general, the season is more ""grown-up,"" but Carrie is still by and large self-absorbed.

My favorite secondary characters from the entire series were introduced in this season: Harry Goldenblatt (endearing in an awkward sort of way--he and Charlotte have great chemistry) and the cute, witty Jack Berger (who turns weird in Season 6). My favorite episodes are ""Critical Condition,"" which captures the atmosphere of New York in a way that, IMO, had been missing in most of Season 4. There is a scene at a market, with a cameo appearance by Heather Graham, that seems so light and airy.

Every season (and really, every television show) has some moments that challenge believablity. The episode ""The Big Journey"" is a little odd to me because Carrie and Samantha go to San Fransisco for a ""book tour"" without stopping anywhere between the coasts. I am no best-selling writer, but I have usually heard of book tours consisting of many stops, rather than a cross-country journey for a single location. Why does she not go down to L.A. or make appearances in the Midwest? It just seems like a moment when the writers were not being very realistic (there is a similar moment in Season 3 when Miranda gest braces for TMJ, which is supposedly related to a tongue-thrusting habit that is causing an imaginary open bite--ask an orthodontist about THAT one). There is also a strange bachelor party on the train, but honestly, most of the men seem more like people I have met than most of the ""New York men"" who are depicted throughout the series. Anyway, the one perk of this bizarre ""Journey"" episode is the appearance of Chris Noth as Mr. Big, who always exudes coolness.

The other really funny episode, along with ""Critical Condition,"" is ""I Love a Charade,"" which features the Hamptons wedding of Nathan Lane, who ironically is marrying a woman.

Overall, I think this season is entertaining, and the four main characters seem to develop a deeper bond throughout the season. I especially recommend this season to women who have recently given birth or to their friends. The baby situations are so funny. Also, there are plenty of great guests, most notably those listed above but also Amy Sedaris and Molly Shannon (both hilarious).

The price of this season has dropped substantially, and for those who took issue with the initial high price, as I did, it is now quite affordable and a worthwhile purchase. I do agree that the packaging could be better than the cheap plastic fold-over thing. The plus to it, though, is that the SATC seasons take up very little space on a media rack. One final note: I always get annoyed by TV show DVDs that do not have an option of playing all the episodes consecutively. There is no ""Play All"" option, so you must keep the remote control handy to select each episode individually. This is especially a pain with half-hour TV shows, which I tend to watch while I am cleaning or doing other work around the house.",1119830400,5,3575,4.750402576489533

Granted i would have liked to see alot more of SATC in this season, however, this is still an entertaining.  I also join the other reviewers with the disguist atthe price of this season, only about half the episodes of the other seasons, and it is still full price.  my advice is this, if you are a true SATC lover you need this season, i feel the characters gain more depth in this season, especially miranda with the birth of her child brady.  I don't have too many complaints becuase i bought this season for about $23 from an independent seller on amazon.com, i suggest you do the same!  it's definitely worth buying if you can find it for less!",1115769600,6,815,4.47972972972973
1859882,4,B00008PW2D,"Based on the bestselling novel by Candace Bushnell, the HBO original series Sex And The City took the television world by storm following its release in the summer of 1998. Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following...

Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as ""Mr. Big"". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...

The Sex And The City (Season 5) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Anchors Away"" in which a sailor invites Carrie to a 'Fleet Week' party (only to have her go home alone due to her inability to forget about her past relationships with Aidan and Mr. Big). Meanwhile, Charlotte has a less than pleasing experience with a naval officer, and Samantha goes to extremes to let the neighborhood know of Richard's infidelities... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""Unoriginal Sin"" in which Samantha gets back together with Richard and Miranda agrees to baptize Brady, and ""The Big Journey"" in which Carrie's book tour takes her out to San Francisco where she's reunited with Mr. Big...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Sex And The City (Season 5) DVD:

Episode 67 (Anchors Away)

Episode 68 (Unoriginal Sin)

Episode 69 (Luck Be an Old Lady)

Episode 70 (Cover Girl)

Episode 71 (Plus One is the Loneliest Number)

Episode 72 (Critical Condition)

1859883,1,B00008PW2D,"I got this as a package of all 5 seasons.  I was eagerly anticipating this one and WOW, what a disappointment.  First, it was so apparent that Sarah Jessica Parker was pregnant and it made all the sex-related scenes seem totally unbelievable.  Also unbelievable were the huge tent-like outfits she wore that were supposed to stylish.  This season made me feel sorry for the characters on the show because they are portrayed as dried out old scags.  It wasn't nearly as funny or entertaining as the other four seasons.  RENT this one instead if you want to be a completist.",1113350400,,572,4.67
1859884,1,B00008PW2D,"One word ""horrible"". This season took all the characters out of there element. They are not sassy and cute anymore but old, alone, frustrated and depressed. This season was a total waste, it contradicted the whole Sex and the City theme of women being able to be as free as picky and as carefree as men! If this season was about men being 36 going on 37 nothing would have changed men would be free as birds still young, still on the hunt and no need to settle hence, Mr. Big the guy is practically in his 40's in the series and still won't commit to Carrie, but that's ok he's a man and still needs to get some things straightened out. In season five there is that constant reminder that woman at 36 going on 37 should stop fooling around and start getting serious. It was a complete dissapointment and made the sex and the city gals look like desperate old maids. So they have slept with all of Manhattan if they were guys it would be excepted!

All those who think this season was GREAT get real, did you forget the name of it ""Sex and the City""!!! Hello these characters are meant to test the waters, no matter how many dirty fishes the hudson river has.",1111449600,3,1158,4.287671232876712

After season 4, the girls had been through so much that we hardly recognized them any more.  What season 5 does is bring them back to their season 1 and 2 comedy.  Season 5 is very funny and reflective.

Yeah it's only 8 shows, but let's get real, it's a nice break for true fans.  The show is so addicting that it's hard to just sit and watch one show.  Before you know it, it's 3 hours later and you have one more disc to watch.  Season 5 gives you that break before the emotionally packed season 6!

I bought this season used here on Amazon - it was worth it.  Rememeber to check and see if it's the original packaging.  SOme people make copies and sell them that way.

1859886,4,B00008PW2D,"I'm really behind the ball here only half way through the season before the last. The tone is different. One (Samantha) is easing out of the only monogamous relationship she ever had. One (Charlotte) is waiting for Mr. Right to knock on her door after marrying Mr. Wrong. One (Miranda) is a little chubby (oh my god) from having a baby & is just too tired & not in the mood. Carrie has decided she doesn""t need men. Either they are getting older, which they are or they've gone through the entire male population of Manhattan.

  This show may be one of the best things ever on cable (The Sopranos excepted) but their shtick is wearing thin & is less creditable. We have four still gorgeous women galloping towards middle age, still relationship-phobic. Six years is probably enough.",1110844800,,783,4.659420289855072

On quality, I probably enjoyed the 5th season the best, as I watch the show for its comedy not for its soap.  The other 4 seasons were all built around Carrie's self-absorbed (boring) love affairs.  This one dispensed with that format and so we were spared the only part of the show that I don't like.

It is vital to the completion of the series.  I have all seven dvds sets for the series, and I would pay for even a final episode (if it wasn't in the last half of the sixth), because it's that great.  You can't be a real fan without appreciation for this season, no matter how short it is or who is pregnant (and wearing funny clothes).

1859899,2,B00008PW2D,"The fifth season seems to have lost its way on the trip from the first to the sixth season. With a few exceptional moments, the rest of it was a sad let down.

1859900,2,B00008PW2D,"First of all, I don't have a problem with it being short-and it is, only being 8 episodes long. If Sarah Jessica Parker wants to have a baby, then she should have a baby. But if it's going to be short, couldn't the episodes have been better? Answer: Yes. Could've.

  When we left our four girls, Big had moved to Napa, leaving our beloved protagonist Carrie alone in the big city in my personal favorite episode, I HEART NY. Also, Charlotte decided to get over her divorce, Samantha discovered what it was like to get a broken heart, and Miranda met a new man of her life:her son Brady. These four lovely ladies start off this season freshly single, and knowing the show, it won't stay that way for too long.

  New changes are in the air. To begin with, Carrie is about to publish a book of her collumns. Charlotte celebrates her 36th birthday with the girls in Atlantic City while Samantha (briefly) gets back with her ex (vile Richard) and Miranda discovers the ups and downs to having a post-baby body-and life. Sounds great, right? That's just the first three episodes. Then on the (forgettable) fourth one, Carrie walks in on Samantha, uh...uhh...having an oral session with ""her"" World Wide Express guy. The way that Carrie judges Samantha was just totally unrealistic and out of character for both of them-they've been friends for way too long and should've known each other better. And in the delightful fifth episode, Carrie celebrates her launch party and meets the charming (but taken) Jack Berger (played to perfection by that guy from OFFICE SPACE) and all the girls wonder why plus one is the lonliest number. And the sixth episode is just too much like the fourth-they both have the same themes of judging and it's just too seen it all before stuff. And in the seventh episode, Carrie, desperate for a man, takes Samantha with her to San Fransisco to ""catch up"" with Big. It's just really bad-Carrie is just too desperate and it's soo out of character for her. And as the cherry topper of this poor episode, Charlotte gets hot and heavy with her divorce lawyer who, in short terms, isn't exactly a Calvin Klein model. I really don't have a problem with Charlotte, or any of the ladies, dating unattractive men, but the way the way that they have to magnify it and make it so obvious is just sappy and cliched. But luckily the show pulls itself together for a good last episode. It's stylish and made me wanting to see what happens in the sixth season...

  ...but that doesn't save it. Overall, the episodes were really dry and unoriginal. If it's only going to be eight episodes long, couldn't they be at least mediocre? Save yourself thirty dollars and four hours if you're smart",1103500800,10,2698,4.627615062761507
1859901,4,B00008PW2D,"Lots of people seem to have negative feelings about this season -- even ""Entertainment Weekly"" joined the chorus of boos in a recent issue, calling it the worst of the six seasons. But most complaints seem to focus on the season's brevity and the expense of the box set, which aren't faults of the show itself.

In fact, this is my favorite of the seasons. The show seemed to gain a new maturity, exploring the downside of singledom (namely, loneliness) in a way that previous seasons hadn't. The women were actually single for most of the season, forcing them to concentrate on their friendships and careers. It was also the first season taped after 9-11, and reflects the introspective turn New York City itself took in the months after the towers fell. Sure, some of the episodes were a bit depressing, but depressing in a good way -- i.e., they made you think. To name one example: ""Plus One is the Loneliest Number"" managed to blend humor and pathos in plot points such as Samantha's plastic surgery and the Candace Bergen character's split relationship, a situation that she loathed on the one hand and coolly justified on the other.

Miranda has her baby, Brody with Steve even though she chooses to raise him alone, and Carrie spends the season single, eventually meeting Berger, whom she develops a crush on. Samantha finally dumps Richard after she spies on him, proving that he'd been cheating on her. Her disguise, with the Raquel Welsh wig is priceless. Carrie still hasn't gotten over her love for shoes (that won't ever go away) and still seems to have trouble with them. In this case, Miranda's water breaks on them...

Season Five is one of the seasons that I have a complaint about, not to Sex and the City, but to HBO. I don't think its fair, just as many people don't, that HBO charge us full price for Season Five when it is only 8 episodes. If they would have put decent special features, then it would be worth the money.

I feel sad that no one has even TRIED to duplicate it--I know full duplication can't be done but since it's leaving I would even have settled for some decent knockoffs of the show (laughter). In no other show/film have sex and relationships from the point of view of women been explored this frankly--it will probably never happen again-at least not in my lifetime. I am in the middle of watching the fifth season. I'm enjoying it. We have all watched these four women for four years now. Are they supposed to remain unchanged in any way for that long? Shouldn't they have different changes and challenges in their lives? I will admit that the fifth season did not come as close to perfection as the others did. (Has your work been almost perfect consistently everyday in everyway 365 days a year for 4 straight years? Mine hasn't-it's called being human.) Season Four in my opinion is still an essential for anyone who really connects with this one-of-kind series. Being that I respect the brave work of this ground-breaking show and because this format is supposed to review the material and the work--(...) Also don't you find it amazing the things people put their passion and rage behind? Homeless mothers who need health care for their children express this level of passionate anger about overpriced prescription drugs-however a person ranting about the cost of a HBO sitcom on DVD-and going on and on like some of these people have here?? I tend to wave that off as ""You have some serious issues and buying SATC is probably the least of your problems"" Some reviews can be dismissed right away like the ones from misogynists who obviously just hate to see independent women having fun and enjoying sex/relationships/career in the free-wheeling way men always have. They secretly want all women to be like Afghan women were under the Taliban. (...). (...)

A lot of people will say that Season 5 is what's wrong with SATC, but I say that Season 5 is what's RIGHT about the show!  Season 5 is the most realistic of all six seasons.  Playfully dubbed ""the season without men"" by the show's writers, there are very few long-term (or short-term, for that matter) relationships for the women in this season.  Until Season 5, the women of SATC have gone through a seemingly endless string of semi-serious to serious relationships without any real examination of what and who the women are without men.  This season forces all of the women to show their true colors without men.  Even Samantha's antics are toned down and used more to expose who she is rather than what she does.
Many fans complained that Season 5 wasn't funny enough.  Not enough men, not enough sex.  Real single women know that Season 5 was the closest of all the seasons to what all of us experience in our daily lives - loneliness, good friends, occasional romantic connections, and a lot of ""in between"".  Season 5 isn't ""filler"" or a poor season - its real life.  Fans of the show who don't enjoy this season are, perhaps, happy to forget about their own lives while following those of Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha.

I ask you - why pay this? Two-three hour films with extensive bonus footage (see Gangs of New York, Moulin Rouge, Pirates of the Carribean) are less than half that cost, and while Amazon and stores such as Wal-Mart are nice enough to sell the disc for $30, we are STILL paying too much!!
I do own Season One of SATC and plan on compelting my collection as soon as possible, but this does not change the fact that I feel a unjustice was made in overpricing this disc and all of HBOs DVDs.

  I will not dispute that this season was too short however it was still full of the same smart witty oneliners and plots that I not only know but love. My favorite is I Love A Charade because I feel a part of someone's wedding charade. I take great pleasure in the fact that I am living this episode only it is not over in 24 minutes but ends in August when 'L' marries 'M'. We collectively know it will not last but something within us all wants it to last and want L to be happy.
  I cannot stand in the way of someone's happiness even if I do not agree with it. I think we would all play along with the sad and distrubing picture of L's wedding than tell her she is wrong. She is all about be in an and relationship and making we appointments. I am not one for this because this city girl values fashion, Newbury Street, walks in the Charles and lives in the Fens. I am independent and find great comfort in the comfort of my friends. So in the grand scheme of things I conclude with a toast.

1859957,3,B00008PW2D,"This set offers the best transfers so far with crystal clear resolution and strikingly vibrant colours. For the first time 5.1 surround sound has been applied to each episode. In fact, the show looks and sounds better then when it originally aired on HBO. Unfortunately, the amount of supplemental material is still on the skimpy side but the quality of the show is what counts.
""When you are single and live in New York, there is no end to the ways to fill your day. Museums, parks, theaters, concert halls, night clubs and countless restaurants."" This quote, spoken by Carrie at the beginning of the first episode perfectly encapsulates the central theme of the season: being single in the city. As the season begins Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha are all getting over men in their lives.
The best episodes of this season are the ones where our four leading ladies celebrate their individuality. From their trip to Atlantic City to celebrate Charlotte's birthday to Carrie and Samantha's cross-country train ride for Carrie's book reading and signing gig in San Francisco (with a classic appearance by Mr. Big), these characters revel in the bachelorettehood. They prove that older women do not have to conform to the traditional belief that by a certain age you must be married and have children.
Sex and the City's strengths are many, most notably its great writing, fantastic cast and the locations. The show is actually shot in New York City and this gives it a real sense of place, unlike Friends (also set in the Big Apple) which only offers a simulacrum of the city. Sex and the City really captures the high level of energy inherent with living in Manhattan. People are more aggressive, they don't hold back anything and aren't afraid to tell it like it is. For anyone who lives or has lived in the city, there are not only many landmarks on display that only they will recognize but also a few obvious ones that anyone who has a passing familiarity with the city will know.
As for the extras -- one of the show's producers and writers, Michael Patrick King contributes three audio commentaries for three of the episodes. On the season opener, ""Anchors Away,"" he talks about how they set the tone of that particular season and how the events of 9/11 affected how they depicted life in New York City. He has a very engaging voice and conveys a lot of good information and observations on this track. Fans of the show will definitely want to check out his commentaries.
""Interactive Trivia Game"" is a bland game where one has to answer questions that pertain to the fifth season. It's a shame the DVD producers didn't take pointers from the Legally Blonde 2 DVD which had the cast and crew actually ask the questions and offer funny answers to right and wrong answers specifically done for the disc. A missed opportunity to be sure.
""Behind the Scenes with Costume Designer Patricia Field"" is an interesting look at one of the most important aspects of the show: what the characters wear.
Comparing this set to the first season box set only reinforces the great leaps of quality and quantity that has gone into these DVDs.",1075161600,7,3139,4.740402193784278

I didn't buy it cause i knew it would only be 8 episodes. i just rented it out first and i don't plan to buy it. In all fairness though.... im sure it wouldnt hurt them much to just lower the price! You're buying less than half the material on other seasons. Plus the episodes where..... what happened to this show? It just seemed to repeat itself but in a more superficial way.

As with every episode of SITC, when one storyline fails another brilliant one rises up to take its place.

Here's a tip for those who haven't bought the Fifth Season yet: if you or a friend have an annual membership to one of those bulk-purchase warehouse stores (in the US--they're everywhere), you can buy one of the other SNTC season DVDs (if you're missing one) and get money off of this one in-store.  It's not the BEST deal, but it's better than how I made out.

I was troubled by a certain hardness to the characters in the fourth season, but thought their humanity was back in this season. I'm not too concerned about Carrie's wardrobe--even in her pre-pregnancy days it was outlandish (though entertaining) for those of us who live in the real world. I enjoyed every single episode, from Miranda's fling with Weight Watchers, Charlotte's dabbling in self-help books, Samantha's shopping expedition and babysitting turn (gotta see it), to the final, and best episode of all, the Hamptons wedding farce.

I write the review after having seen the season premier of the last season last night on HBO (another 8 episode DVD coming up) and because I've followed the show so closely from day one and seen each episode numerous times, I have to say the acting is going downhill as well, not just the stories.  I find myself now just watching it for the sake of seeing the episodes, not like before (especially season 4) where I was anticipating the upcoming episode to see what happened with the SATC girls.
But as every show, it must come to an end,  I think it was dragged on too much and hense the bad episodes which seem to be pointless at times, after all how many different types of men can they bag on?

Could it have been better...sure; but it could've been a lot worse.  So the girls weren't ""men-obsessed"" like the usual seasons.  This season allowed the girls to look deep into their ""single-selves.""  Being single and all alone sucks, and this season showed that.  Everyone gets lonely, so it was inevitable that our favorite and fabulous girls were bound to feel the brunt of our pain.  In this season we seem to get deeper into the character lives.  We find out what fuels their passion, love, and desire..it's just a matter of whether or not their tank is full!  The only problem I had with this season was Carrie's clothes.  I know she was prego and all, but come on!  Her fashion sense is what drives this show.  This season consisted of too many long and short tunic like frocks!

Worst:
1) There were only 8 episodes in this season - enough said.
2) Too much time was spent on dreary emotional issues and forced sentimentality.
3) There was no good nudity or hot sex scenes (and Samantha was just a big tease).
Recommendation:
The high retail price and low overall amount of humor or sex are big reasons to NOT recommend this season.

These scant 8 episodes are not engrossing and the writing is rather poor.  The full bodied wit and the quality of the first four seasons is conspicuously absent here.  I don't know if the writers are burned out or what, but each of these episodes is just, well, ""off"" for some reason.  Overall, this box set (if you can even call it that) is not a good value, even if you are a fan of the series (which I am).",1073001600,4,567,4.081081081081081

However, the fact that season 5 is only 8 episodes, still costs $32, and just didn't have the same freshness and unique feel as the first four seasons was a major disappointment.  Something is just missing all around here.  If you are worried about missing something, rent it, otherwise, wait for season 6.",1072915200,4,500,4.354838709677419

Even at this price it's so worth it to be able to pop in the DVD anytime you want and watch these hilarious girls take New York by storm. Just thinking of some of the highlights of the fifth season, I bust out laughing- from Miranda's belly button fiasco, to finally meeting Steve's ""mah"", having Molly Shannon and Amy Sedaris guest as Carrie's book publishers. This season also had great epsodes, like the introduction of Harry, Charlotte's divorce laywer and the best season finale ever, ""I Love a Charade."" Season five may have been short on episodes, but it was long on laughs, and really if Carrie can drop $400 on a pair of Manolo Blahniks, I think you can spend $40 on this....so stop complaining and just buy it already, you won't be dissapointed!! :)",1072742400,,826,4.513333333333334
1860023,3,B00008PW2D,"Okay. First let me first say that I am writing from the perspective of a 20 year-old male college student. Not that being a guy matters. Well. It does.
Let's be stereotypical for a moment. Guys are tight with their money. And in my case, poor college guys are really tight with their money and are really skeptical about buying things unless it's really worth it. I happened to come across the 5th season today and saw if for sale for $30. I am secretly in love with ""Sex and the City"" (so are my fellow college buddies) and own all the other seasons. I remembered that I bought the last season for the exact same price, but with much, much more episodes. I held it in my hands and thought to myself, ""is this worth it?"" Common sense told me no. But my obsessive compulsive alter-ego who was dying to have a complete set told me yes. So I bought it. The moment I got to my apartment, I popped it into the DVD player hoping to convince myself that this was more valuable than the groceries that could have lasted me for a week.
There were two disks.
The first contained:
~Four episodes (Anchors Away, Unoriginal Sin, Luck Be an Old Lady, Cover Girl)
~Audio Commentaries (which are always interesting to listen to)
~A Season Index
The second contained:
~Four episodes (Plus One is the Loneliest Number, Critical Condition, The Big Journey, I Love a Charade)
~Audio Commentaries
~A Trivia Game (Fun for only about 5 minutes)
~A Behind the Scenes feature with Costume Designer, Patricia Field (About 22 minutes long, only for those interested in women's fashion. It talked about all designs for all four girls)
So did I convince myself that it was worth it? Kinda. Truthfully, buy it if you're a die-hard fan. If you're even wondering about whether are not you should even pick it up, don't. I sucked it up like a man and watched a couple of episodes. And some of them are really great. Mr. Big sorry for everything that he did in ""The Big Journey""? Man that guy is cool.

The product description clearly tells you that you're getting eight episodes. If you don't want to spend the money for eight episodes, then don't. Nobody's holding a gun to your heads. A true fan will savor every moment of the show and wouldn't think of holding it against the Fab Four that the people who produce the DVD's of their show are overcharging us.

Whatever the reason, this show illustrates quite well precisely what is wrong with our culture.  Although it is dressed as a ""comedy,"" it's quite easy to see that they producers of this show are holding up these four women as ideals, as role models.  Yet, they live lives that are strikingly similar to the stereotypical, empty-headed, macho men we'd learned to avoid and decry.  And their hideous personas make them  ugly, even if on the outside some might find them attractive.  (Frankly, I think it's impossible to see them as physically attractive after they've opened their mouths to spout their gibberish lines.)

I did like Carrie having to do a book signing with that ""alien"" dog a highlight. I wished there was more of Amy Sedaris. She should have been a bigger character. Maybe if the season had been longer there would have been more time to flesh out the stories. Understandably, Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy had something to do with it.

The shorten season, due to Sarah's pregnancy, never really got going anywhere.  It is as if the writers did not want to start anything because they could not finish it in the eight epidsodes allowed.
Also, the girls were different in this season, as they had to be.  Each had life changing moments in season, that could not really be played out in season five.  Samatha, heartbroken from Richard, is more subdued than normal.  Miranda is adjusting to life as a mom.  Carrie is recovering from her second break up with Aiden.  Only Charolette seems to be moving forward in her life, thanks to her divorce attorney.  It would have been nice to have had a ""bonus"" season for season five, so that we could have a continuation of the story lines.
Also, the issue with the price tag on this set is a pressing one.  Only eight episodes is going to call for only two discs.  They should not be more than $30 bucks at the most.  We'll see how well sales do, with the price tag is does have.  I think it would have been better for HBO to have released this set with Season Six.

Sometimes you are alone for a while and are feeling older and out of it. I thought Anchors Away was one of the funniest episodes they ever did as well. The plot lines for Charlotte and Miranda were pretty strong. The only one who kind of went downhill in this season was Kim Catrell. Sometimes they write the silliest plot lines for her (dying her pubic hair, getting a chemical peel) and don't really show the fact that she can act.
I'm also surprised about all the pricing complaints here. Yes, it is not as good of a product as we've had before. But people also pay from 15 - 20 dollars for a cd on average. We're getting two dvd discs for 30 dollars. It's not that big of a deal! I watch my Sex and the City dvd's over and over again so it's worth the price. I'm kind of surprised that they just didn't tack on the six episodes from the other ""bonus"" season and have season four be only 12 episodes like the first one, so that way both bonus seasons would give us 14 episodes. But whatever. That's one way to do it. I plan on buying it all the same.

1860078,2,B00008PW2D,"I am an avid watcher of Sex and the City, I adore the show. However, I think other fans will agree with me when I say that Season 5 was pretty much the lowpoint of the series. I record all of the episodes of every season and watch them frequently . . . I haven't touched my Season 5 tapes since it aired.
Initially, it was supposed to be 13 episodes (instead of the normal 18) to accomodate Sarah's pregnancy. We were supposed to get 8 episodes in the summer and then she was to return to the show for 5 more episodes the following spring. As you can see, that never happened. We were left with 8, ""okay"" episodes.
My main complaint and its a big one, is the pricing of the DVD ""set"", if you can call it that. This is the shortest season of the series, 8 episodes, compared to the normal 18. Now why in hell would I pay just as much money for 8 episodes as I would for 18? I mean, maybe if they'd added some special features to this set to make up for a lack of episodes, I might consider buying this. However, knowing what I do about the Sex and the City DVDs I own, I highly doubt that anything has been added.
In short, I cannot recommend this purchase simply because HBO is asking the same from us (monetarily speaking) and only delivering about a quarter of what they have in the past (episodes and episode quality). Even though I love the series, I will not purchase this item.",1066348800,139,1383,4.144981412639405

1860085,5,B00008PW2D,"Okay, let's start off with just saying that I started watching Sex and the City during it's fourth season. After I saw a few episodes, I went to Best Buy and bought The Complete First & Second Seasons of Sex and the City.
My eyes were glued to the tv. Side-splitting humor combined with four sexy women and I say you have a winner. One episode after another after another. It never gets old. This show really explores sexuality and what women think about it. I find this show very informative yet funny. Sometimes, I even forget I'm watching a show. I feel like I'm in NYC, with the ladies, talking about sex.
When The Complete Third Season came out on DVD, I bought it the first day it was for sale. Still great sexual humor. I couldn't get enough of it. But in the third season, the show started showing a more dramatic side of the characters. Not that I'm saying its bad, I just like it when you can have humor with information, with drama. And not too much drama, just enough.
As I was watching The Complete Fourth Season, I began to realize, I'm starting to connect with these characters. Thats amazing!
I highly anticipate the fifth and sixth seasons on DVD. The fifth season was short but sassy and comedic. Although I have only seen the first 5 episodes of the sixth and final season, I'm sure it'll be just as good or even better then the last 5 seasons. Though it will be sad to see the ladies go, I'm hoping they'll make a Sex and the City movie, or something to keep us SATC fans going.
So if you're out there...contemplating whether or not you should buy any of the show's DVDs, don't think twice about it, order them NOW. I recommend you order all so you can get the full ""dose"" of the show. So please, order the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons of this wonderful and fabulous show.",1058832000,19,1818,4.3657817109144545
1860086,3,B00008PW2D,"Like most people here i have been a fan since they first began, but yes, the 5th season was not one of there best, but i can undertsand why, the writers on the show had most of the season writen out when both Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon annonced they were pregnent, so the cast had to take a 3 week break during filming so that the writers can re-write all the episodes, and because Sarah's belly was growing, the writers had to cut the season short. so they had to move through the story lines very fast and it was a mess.
Even though the 5th season was not all that great, it was a good chance to introduce new members to the cast.  The Sixth season has began, they are now on the forth episode and they are great, I do feel they are going to go out with a bang this final season.",1058054400,9,793,4.050955414012739
1860087,3,B00008PW2D,"When a show is as good as Sex And The City had been for four seasons, it's bound to take a fall. And when a show is as popular as Sex And The City is, everyone's bound to notice. That's what happened with Sex And The City's Fifth ""Bonus"" Season. The bonus word thrown around in an attempt to distract us from realizing that the whole season (only 8 episodes, but thank God cause who could have put up with more?) was spent reaching. The well had officially run dry. What's really a shame is that the whole season wasn't so terrible, but because SATC fans are so used to perfection, it seemed like a train wreck.
The most obvious problem was the stories. SATC, a TV show known for diving into the problems of four single 30 something New York ladies, quickly became a story about four bitter aging women who's fears had come true. Since the show's beginning they had feared becoming old, tired maids and that's exactly what happened.
On the season's premiere episode, Anchors Away, the ladies all but throw Miranda in a Taxicab so she and her baby can go home and they can go live it up at a party with the sailors. All of this would have been fine when the show first began, but later there's a shot of Carrie, Samantha and Charlotte walking to the party and instead of it being sexy, it was so sad. I actually felt embarrassed for them. The show has always been mostly true to life, but if three single worn out looking women pushing well into their 40s went to a party looking like they did with a bunch of 20 something guys, they'd get laughed at.
Miranda and Carrie's nostalgia quickly echoed ours as the viewer began to realize this was a preview of things to come. Out of all 8 episodes, I only enjoyed 2 of them and I was only really happy with 2 of the characters.
Carrie being sent to work for Vogue was a terrible idea. The fifth season saw her become more self centered than usual. I haven't always agreed with Carrie's choices, but I've respected them up until this season. Her selfishness pushed past its final limits and answered to pretty much everyone but her as to why she's still single. As for less important things, her hair looked God-awful. Her face was way too pale this season and the way they tried to hide Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy was just absurd. From everything to hideous dresses to giant magazines, it was quite noticeable and would have been more believable had she just ""gained weight"" from the stress of her book.
Samantha was a terrible disappointment this season. As someone who's deliciously decedent and so much fun to watch, I can see why the writers wanted to make her more human and see her fall in love, but what they did to Samantha's character was unforgivable. First she's in love, then she's afraid, then she's insecure, then she gets a broken heart, then she forgives Richard, then she's insecure again until finally she turns psycho and accuses Richard of cheating again when he wasn't. Later in the season she practically tries to kill two of Richard's houseguests when they won't leave because she's throwing a party in his house which she wasn't even given permission to do.
Charlotte stayed most true to herself than all of the other characters. She remained to be the ""eternal optimist"" and really kept the show alive for me. Watching Charlotte be herself amongst a group of people who weren't being themselves gave me a little sliver of hope. I enjoyed watching her fall in love with the hairy lawyer who's so not her type and I enjoyed watching her not give up on love. Kristen Davis was incredible this year and deserved a nomination, which she has yet to receive.
Miranda also made me proud acting like the only adult on the show. She had a baby, her and Steve tried their best to get their lives together and raise Brady as best as they could. Miranda often felt left out by her friends, she was. Miranda often had tough choices to make concerning her baby, moms always do. I liked watching Miranda struggle with this as it brought the only realism to the show.
As for the episodes, most of them were lacking. In one episode, Carrie freaks because she runs into Aiden's ex and she makes a face at her and Carrie realizes Aiden must have told her some horrible things about her. Oh no! Could she really have hurt him so bad, she later asks Steve, Aiden's best friend. Hello! She dumped him twice and cheated on him. How Carrie can be THIS selfish and THIS dumb is beyond me.
Also in that episode, Heather Graham shows up for no reason which becomes a theme in this season - things happening for no reason. Miranda asks Carrie to be her baby's Godmother instead of Charlotte. Carrie decides out of the blue in one episode, she needs to get laid. So she returns to Mr. Big. Why he sleeps with her after she made fun of him in her book makes no sense and gives guys like me a bad name.
This season was a big let down for me. Not only did it make no sense, but it was a slap in the face to those who adore the show. Uninteresting stories, new uninteresting characters (one who's name is Burger, don't ask) and favorite characters changing into paper thin shadows of their former selves made this a very forgettable season of Sex And The City.
The only enjoyable episodes were Unoriginal Sin, an episode where Miranda gets Brady christened and I Love A Charade, the season finale where Charlotte falls in love and a little Zsa Zsa Zsu is put back into the show.",1053907200,54,5420,4.448241206030151
1860088,2,B00008PW2D,"I absolutely love Sex and the City. I have been a fan from the very beginning and was really shocked and disappointed by the fifth season. We are talking about 8 episodes, all of which seem to be grasping at straws. An example? In one episode, Miranda has become so self conscitious about her baby weight that she joins weight watchers. While there she meets a man who himself is fighting the battle of the bulge. The do become romantically involved. During a particularly randy romp Miranda notices that the guy has gotten ""love juice"" all over his face. Miranda knew the guy was a sloppy eater but this was ridiculous. She basically found him repulsive. From my point of view, that whole episode was tasteless and crude. Im sorry Darren Starr hasn't been able to get the girls in better situations. I am looking forward to the show's end, its basically time for it. Nobody can live as wide open as these girls forever. I just hope they bring back Chris Noth.

7986424,5,B00008PW2D,"This was (is) one of my all time favorite shows! Someone mentioned that this show was dated but you have to remember, this first aired in the late 90s, so the first few seasons of it ARE dated! It took them a few years into the series for the women to settle in to what their image was going to be, and what would remain for the rest of the series until it ended. Another thing people commented on was they talked too much into the camera, which they did a lot in the beginning but that subsided as the seasons progressed. Although, Im not sure why people have such a problem with that.....Modern Family does it and they are quite successful. Its not for everyone I guess.

For the show itself, yes, they talked about sex, they mused about sex......they waxed poetically about sex. But if you watch the whole series, youd discover that it was just all surface talk/activity. The show was much more about their friendships with each other. A close knit group of women who were more like family, not just girlfriends. And just like every other show out there, there was a character for everyone to either love or hate. Someone you could identify with yourself, or someone who youd never understand.

I originally watched the show when it aired on HBO, but then later bought them on DVD so I could binge watch whenever I want. I think I mustve watched the entire series at least 30 times! I never bothered watching them on a syndicated channel because they cut out all the good stuff. As much as people complain at how crude it could be sometimes (and it could), you lose some of that context when its cut out. With that said though, Im guessing if you didn't want to watch a show that leaned heavily on the topic of sex, you wouldnt be watching a show called Sex and the City. Just a guess!
