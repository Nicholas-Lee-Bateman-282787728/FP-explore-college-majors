8452065,5,B0050Z3PTS,"I first saw this movie when I was 5 or 6 years old.  It was an enchanting movie filmed in the beautiful country of Southern Utah about a beautiful black stallion.  Beware, it will fuel a live long love affair with horses that is incurable.  Every horse lover should be able to see this movie as it is done wonderfully...and with humor with Fred MacMurray and others in the cast.  PLEASE BRING THIS BACK ON DVD.  I have been searching for this movie to purchase on VHS and now DVD a great part of my life...I am 74!  It is a wonderful moving showing the devotion and trust between humans and animals.",1386460800,7,599,4.303571428571429
8452066,5,B0050Z3PTS,This movie stuck with me since I was 12 yrs old. I remembered Fred MacMarray. As Clint. His performance stood out and it touched you. Maybe because it was in black and white.,1366588800,5,174,4.303030303030303
8452067,5,B0050Z3PTS,"I loved this film as it was the filmed version of a prize book, (Smokey, The Story Of A Horse), I received when I was at school in the 1940s. I always loved the book, but was never able to replace it after it was distroyed in the 1953 East Coast Floods. I was not aware that it had been made into a film, until I saw it on Sky Films recently.",1362960000,2,342,3.763888888888889
