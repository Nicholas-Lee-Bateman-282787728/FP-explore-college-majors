7669084,4,B01BTDORYQ,"The plot is pretty simple. A shark, out minding its own business, bites an alien ship and morphs into a shark/robot hybrid that then attempts to destroy Seattle.

  Roboshark is a family friendly version of the Scyfy ( however they're spelling it now) Monster movie. it has some blood and some people, obviously, are eaten alive by the Roboshark but it's pretty tame. And it's funny. There is plenty of quick, throw-away humor, some subtle and some not so subtle. There's a little eye candy and a touch of suspense. They poke a little fun at Bill Gates. If you are a film buff, you can try and catch the dozen or so movies that are referenced here. The script is peppered with light satire. Basically it has a little something for everyone.

  Produced by a Bulgarian film company ( BUFO) you can see some store signs sporting the Russian alphabet in some long shots.

  It's got a relaxed, fun vibe to it. I bet the cast and crew had a good time making it.  It's a nice choice for Movie Night for any family with kids maybe 5-ish or ove, although for a 5 year old it would skirt the edge of being fairly scary.",1460851200,,1111,4.349514563106796

7669086,4,B01BTDORYQ,"This movie is one of the SyFy's ""Monster of the Week"" movies.  But in case you miss this they pretty much tell you 3 or so times during the movie.  This movie does not seem to be a direct sequel to Robo Croc but it is similar.  It start out with a probe from an alien spacecraft that splashes down and promptly gets swallowed by a shark and then the shark becomes Roboshark and makes a beeline to Seattle.  The movie is humorous and doesn't take itself too seriously.  I enjoyed this movie.  It was fun to watch.",1459036800,,512,4.173469387755102
7669087,4,B01BTDORYQ,"An alien snitch is swallowed by a shark turning it into Roboshark, whose apparent goal is to attack the city of Seattle, ridding the globe of coffee snobs, making it safe for alien and human life. The film centers on a family, as usual.  Trish Landson (Alexis Peterman) is a channel 55 weather girl. She is married to Rick (Matt Rippy) who works for the city water and sewer and has an Internet savvy 15 year old daughter (Vanessa Grasse) with 11,000 Instagram followers. Trish is attempting to get the story before station rival Veronica (Laura Dale) as the shark drama almost becomes secondary.

The film takes an unusual plot killing twist at about 1 hour, but then who cares.

The film is a spoof of SyFy films, which are spoofs themselves.  There are numerous statements made within the film that are almost asides as when Rick asks if this is a comedy. The submarine technology is all wrong. The roboshark approaches the sub and the navigator is told, ""it is in our baffles"" which is weird because the baffles is a blind spot on a sub that sonar can't detect. The dialogue is cheesy and acting is bad by design. The Navy officer drinks TAFF with an FTA marking (F-the army). The film has worked in a number of these small details, but perhaps the best spoof is that of Bill Glates (Steve Sires) who is clearly the computer geek who uses a modified ""Close Encounters..."" riff to contact the alien shark. Guess how that works.

If you like SyFy silliness, this one has It is one to avoid for those who want to watch a serious well made film...but you should be able to tell that from the title. Killing, disaster, minor blood. No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1458864000,2,1659,4.516666666666667

8751395,5,B01BTDORYQ,"I enjoyed this movie, it was very entertaining and filmed in Washington! Can't ask for much more from a spoof on all the Shark movies. I also enjoy them.",1505865600,,153,4.310344827586207

8751401,4,B01BTDORYQ,"If you are into cheesy movies, Roboshark takes the crown.  Packed with unheard of scenarios, Bill Gates saving the world and the use of today's tech savvy social media, it's a movie unlike any other.  The movie tries to spoof other Syfy shows, and does a pretty decent job, if you are into the also cheesy syfy movies.  Watching it once was good enough for me but the kids have asked to watch it again and I don't know if I can subject myself to that much action. I gave it 4 stars because my kids are drawn to the shark aspect of it and I found it amusing how they referenced so many other movies.  Movie buffs will get a good belly laugh watching this and forget it's a movie about a Roboshark.",1463702400,,696,4.1716417910447765
8751402,3,B01BTDORYQ,I give it a 3 because the shark was low budget it would had looked more realistic if they used a real shark that moved like a robot.,1463356800,,132,3.75
