8123651,5,B000FJMZV8,"Maria Felix as Diana is the epitome of sultry glamour and beauty in this fabulous Mexican classic, which was directed and co-written by Fernando de Fuentes. She plays with fire and an old man's passion, and compromises his nephew, a doctor who falls in love with her at first sight (Luis Aldas as Miguel). Diana is a master of manipulation, gets her doting maid (Conchita Gentil Arcos) to lie for her, and the men in her life to do her will.  She plans to marry the older man (Julio Villarreal as Don Adolfo), while at the same time keep her young handsome lover (Felipe de Alba as Pablo) with tragic results, and the net she weaves keeps us riveted to the screen. This is a well written film, with tight pacing and lovely cinematography by Ignacio Torres, and the acting is excellent throughout. The film reminds me in many ways of the brilliant ""Double Indemnity"" with Barbara Stanwyck.

There is a 2 disc set available in some stores (for a nice price) that couples this film with ""Algo Flota en el Agua"" starring Arturo de Cordova, which is a much lesser film, but one of those steamy jungle love triangles set in Vera Cruz that makes for good entertainment (This set does not have subtitles, all the better if your Spanish is up to par). ""La Devoradora"" (""The Man Eater"") is a must for fans of the gorgeous Maria Felix, who was perhaps the most beautiful woman to ever grace the silver screen. The film is in excellent condition for its age, and music is by Rosalio Ramirez, with Salvador Garcia singing Agustin Lara's aptly titled ""La Aventurera.""",1174348800,,1553,4.58273381294964
