1386167,5,B000050NS4,I enjoyed the first American Ninja but this is even more fly high kicking than the original. It has more hand to hand combat fights rather than sword fights. Also in this film Michael Dudikoff dus a great flying kick. This is worth more than ($),993600000,7,245,4.3478260869565215
1386168,3,B000050NS4,"American Ninja 2 is a lower budgeted sequel, but it is better than the original. Dudikoff is back and so is his muscle bound partner Steve James. The story is entirely laughable, but Dudikoff kicks but in the action lead. Again I enjoyed American Ninja 2, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone except fans of B-Action movies or Golan-Globus fans. This was the last good American Ninja entry, 3-5 don't measure up.",989539200,7,414,4.684931506849315

7929135,3,B000050NS4,"Being a notorious non-fan of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja/dp/B00005N89J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja</a>, imagine my surprise when I finally got around to watching its sequel and found a relatively decent martial arts film. A good deal of problems still abound throughout this picture, whose new shooting location of South Africa is only a moderately more appropriate step above the Philippines, but whereas I had to urge myself to sit through the original, ""The Confrontation"" is a roundly entertaining romp that feels closer to director Sam Firsternberg's standard.

The story: returning soldiers Joe Armstrong (Michael Dudikoff) and Curtis Jackson (Steve James) are transferred to a remote Caribbean island to investigate the disappearance of several Marines - the work of an evil drug lord with an army of ninja at his command (Gary Conway,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burke-s-Law/dp/B0013PVGGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burke's Law</a>).

It needs to be pointed out that while this is a fairly good martial arts movie, this is a pretty sucky ninja movie. Once again, the ninjas behave as foot soldiers rather than shadow warriors - jogging onto a sunlit beach with a complete lack of surprise, clumsily handling swords and other kobudo weapons, and generally having their butts handed to them even by performers besides Dudikoff and James. This last part is particularly embarrassing when you later find out (SPOILER) that these guys have been genetically engineered to be the ultimate fighting machines with super strength, etc. However, while the ninjas may be slouches, it seems like at least Michael Dudikoff has been spending some time in the dojo: after his thoroughly embarrassing physical effort in the original film, he delivers significantly better fight scenes this time around, particularly one wherein he uses a series of judo throws to repel a gang of bikers. While several retain the first movie's low standard, I give the fights in general a passing grade, especially the bar brawl featuring some genuinely impressive stuntwork.

Speaking of the fights, I'm pleased that Steve James gets a lot more screentime and character moments than before: Dudikoff actually outdoes him where the choreography is concerned, but Steve's clearly the dramatic force of the film. This is good, but few other characters are particularly interesting: the lead villain and his main henchman (martial arts champ and choreographer Mike Stone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-The-Ninja/dp/B005OK0YJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter The Ninja</a>) are surprisingly bland with little character exposition, and eventual love interest Michelle Botes doesn't have a lot of fire. Though he shows a bit more personality this time around, ol' Michael Dudikoff is still about as expressive as a G.I. Joe doll. The story is refreshingly straight-forward with few surprise twists, but without much intrigue despite the superhuman ninja angle. There's some delicious absurdity in the scene wherein Steve James does battle in nothing but his swim trunks, but there's surprisingly little situational nonsense otherwise.

To date, this is the best Dudikoff vehicle I have ever seen, which isn't saying much but does make it worth checking the film out. If you like the series in general, be sure to pick this one up above others, and general B-movie aficionados can check it out without apprehension as well.",1361059200,,3577,5.886319845857418
7929136,3,B000050NS4,"On the plus side, the soundtrack is by George Clinton which gives the film that ""Miami Vice"" feel. On the remote island nation of Blackbeard Island U.S. Marines who guard the embassy are disappearing...being kidnapped by ninjas who dress all in black and never stand out. Two Rangers are called in to replace the marines and find out what is going on, Curtis Jackson (Steve James) and Joe Armstrong (Michael Dudikoff) who contrary to his anme fights with his feet.

The movie is 80's corny. The fight scenes are over choreographed and done to music that makes the fighting ""light"" in nature. No one owns a gun so they all fight ninja style. I enjoyed the film as a campy look at the 1980's. As a stand alone film, it is passe.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1337472000,,755,4.5036496350364965
7929137,4,B000050NS4,"Even better than the original. This one provides some true fun as Dudikoff and James go undercover to Probe the mystery why marines are being kidnapped turns out it involves ninjas. American Ninja II is a best bet for a late night action movie festival. Dudikoff and James last movie together (before Steve James sadly died in 1996). American Ninja II is a must see for fans of the genre thanks to some humor and excellent action scenes. Steve James really steals the show as the sidekick who can handle dialog as well as action scenes. The film feels low rent but you can do a lot worse when it comes to this genre. American Ninja II is a likable action romp that rises above it's low budget and entertains.

Steve James originally didn't want to appear in this first sequel, since it was to be shot in South Africa (which was still under apartheid). He later admitted that he had a lot of fun making the movie, which is evident onscreen. Like the first movie, James steals the show from Dudikoff, both in his martial arts skills and with a bouncy performance that makes him a treat to watch. The best that can be said about Dudikoff's performance is that he seems to be a lot more comfortable in front of the camera than he was the first time around. He's still very unemotional, has almost no dialogue, and it's still clear he knows little to nothing about martial arts, seeing how he does pretty simple moves (when not being doubled.)

Despite the movie being weighed down by Dudikoff's presence, it's still a fun movie, certainly better than the first movie. The locations are eye-catching, giving the movie a nice backdrop. The pace is quicker, giving us little chance to be bored between the action sequences. And there's certainly plenty of action, with dozens of ninjas popping up everywhere at any time. Yes, there is a cheesiness to the entire enterprise, from George Clinton's synthesizer score to the ludicrous scheme of the villain... but hey, it's a *fun* kind of cheese, one that makes you smile instead of grit your teeth. Sometimes a little silliness is what the doctor ordered, and it's also a nostalgic blast for those into '80s action flicks.",1223683200,14,2163,4.64490861618799
7929138,3,B000050NS4,"Steve James and Michael Dudikoff are sent to South Africa to investigate the evil shenanigans of a drug lord who's kidnapped a scientist in order to make an army of ""super ninjas"".

The fight scenes are good (my favorite was the beach scene), the story's entertaining, the locations are beautiful.  This movie could have easily have been as good as the first AMERICAN NINJA except for a few things that I found very distracting:

1) Steve and Michael are briefed towards the beginning by the commanding officer.  The behind the back shot features a stand in for Dudikoff.  How do I know?  Cause he turns around and looks directly at the camera!

2) At the beach fight scene Dudikoff throws a stick (!) at one of the ninjas, it bounces off the ninja's stomach and he falls over dead.

3) When the master ninja throws a knife during the final fight scene the knife does not leave his hand.  The camera just pans over to a screaming guy with a knife sticking out his throat.

4) The fight scene in the bar had way too much funny business going on.  This is suppose to be a serious movie, not NORTH TO ALASKA.

Then again compare the $350,000 budget on Part 2 to the $1,000,000 budget on Part 1 and this film is pretty impressive.  Check it out.",1110326400,2,1241,4.41409691629956
