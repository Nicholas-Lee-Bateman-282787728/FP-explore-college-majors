enjoy it, but now I watch it almost every day on my DVD player. I have season 1-4 and I wish I had the money to buy season 5. I
will buy it as soon as I can. There certainly is NOTHING on tv today that is decent to watch!",1322179200,,349,3.4871794871794872
7927124,5,B00004YA77,This is the first release from this particular set and as stated -from 1957- so it is of course going to be the earlier episodes. BONUS FEATURES: In addition to the regular episodes there is a very informative and entertaining one hour (46 minutes for those who are counting minutes) reunion show with the now deceased Richard Crenna and most of the other cast members. This reunion show is not to be found anywhere else. The price is a great value.,1214870400,2,449,4.555555555555555
7927125,1,B00004YA77,"All shows on this set are the edited versions. Each show is missing more than 3 minutes of footage. The other set from this company is the same. If you want the original un-cut versions then skip these. If you don't mind having missing footage, then go for it. Personally, I would rather

  "" NOT "" have something than have shows the way these are.",1176681600,18,348,4.323076923076923
7927126,5,B00004YA77,"I truly ""Want you to meet the family"". This was a great comedy. I would love to see more of the seasons copied. It wasn't on all that long, but, it was a great show. All the actors, and actresses did a fine job on this show. Walter Brennen at some of his best.",1168300800,2,260,3.8333333333333335
7927127,5,B00004YA77,This is a great way to watch tv as we did as kids. I really like the selection and speedy way it was handled. We have laughed a lot since getting this piece of the past..,1154563200,3,170,3.75
7927128,5,B00004YA77,Really enjoyed this simple and humorous series.  Walter Brenan is a classic.,1133568000,8,76,5.333333333333333
7927129,2,B00004YA77,This was one of my favorite shows of all time. But this DVD was a huge let down. First it is only four episodes. And it is the fist four that were not the best shows. The program got funnier and far better as time went along. Grandpa doesn't evan have his trade mark limp in these episodes.,1081382400,52,290,4.017241379310345
