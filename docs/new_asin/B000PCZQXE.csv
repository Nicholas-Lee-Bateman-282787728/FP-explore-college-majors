8190566,3,B000PCZQXE,"I have 2 dogs & they sort of like the dvd, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly & they become indifferent to the repetitiveness.  The audio is good but the video could be a lot better (basically a camcorder at some type of dog park)",1418601600,,236,4.130434782608695
8190567,5,B000PCZQXE,So fun for my dog :-)  He loves watching this.  Thank you!,1412553600,,58,3.75
8190568,5,B000PCZQXE,my dog loves it,1405209600,,15,3.0
8190569,4,B000PCZQXE,This is my third dog DVD and while they all keep my dog's attention this one seems to a little better although it has more barking. I do reduce the volume so as not to impose on the neighbors who might otherwise think my dog was barking.,1400803200,,237,4.0638297872340425
8190570,2,B000PCZQXE,My dog didn't seem to connect with scenes of dogs playing at a dog park. She immediately rushed to the window to see what was going on outside...Somewhat depressing. Going to donate it to Chimp Haven.,1373500800,,200,4.583333333333333
8190571,4,B000PCZQXE,"The producers of this video never left Monty at the Shelter.
I know for a fact he is happy and living with the producers
and their children. He is a HUGE part of their family. Has been
for a very long time. He was a rescue dog. They did foster a dog
for us at the Humane Society to help socialize him but he was a foster
and he has found his forever home and thanks to them is a very
sweet and social animal.

8190572,1,B000PCZQXE,Waste of money!! drove the dogs crazy the first minute- haven't put it on again.,1240012800,2,80,4.4
8190573,1,B000PCZQXE,"Dogs will like this for the first five minutes and never return...The worst part is knowing that they (the producers) scooted out of town after infuriating all dog boutique businesses and dropped Monty, their dog, off at the Nassau Humane Society... grifters!",1230940800,3,259,5.190476190476191
