8675259,3,B00MXE5ZII,"Assignment Terror is a so-bad-it's-terrible-but-good late 60's or early 70's Spanish-made, English-dubbed horror/sci-fi flick.  A trio of aliens reanimate the corpses of scientists and inhabit the bodies so they can take over the Earth.  They wake up poor quality versions of Universal movie monsters to use as their army.  At 71 minutes it is edited and the picture quality is poor.  I can't comment on Embryo because when I viewed it what did I get but Assignment Terror all over again.  Looks like someone at Cobb Films was asleep at the switch.  One can get Embryo elsewhere but I would love to see a re-mastered complete version of Assignment Terror released very soon.  Perhaps with the original Spanish film included.",1460160000,,724,4.983333333333333
