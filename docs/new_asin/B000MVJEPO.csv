I did not know that it was made in Greece;  I think the seller should have informed the buyer about this information!
Otherwise, the DVD worked as usual.
Thank You!

8173052,4,B000MVJEPO,"Bruce Lee The Legend(1984) is a solid documentary produced by Golden Harvest. It tells us about Lee's life. There's footage from his early Hong Kong movies such as My Son Ah Cheung and The Thunderstorm. There's rare interviews with Nora Miao and Raymond Chow. There's footage of people in 1970's Hong Kong watching a screening of The Big Boss(1971). Footage from Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors From the Magic Mountain(1982) is used to ""paint Chinese history"". There's a screen test of Lee auditioning for a 1960's TV show pilot. There's still photos of Lee planning movie characters that he might play in the future. There's behind the scenes footage of Game of Death(1978). There's footage of Bruce Lee's funeral. There's rare behind the scenes photos of the Italian locations on The Way of the Dragon(1972). There's clips from Enter the Dragon(1973). This documentary is pure fun.",1369353600,,875,5.041379310344827

8173054,4,B000MVJEPO,"Based on some comments in a book about Bruce Lee, I ordered this DVD, and am very glad that I did! ""Bruce Lee, The Legend"" is a comprehensive review of the life and career of Lee, both professional and personal.  What differentiates it from many such works on the market in this country is that it is not an American production.  As a result, the perspective of the DVD is significantly more Asian, with a heavier emphasis on the work that he did for the Asian markets.  Included is a lot of hard-to-find film footage from his childhood movie career, and some fascinating video interviews with folks such as Nora Miao and Betty Ting-Pei.  This DVD will help round out the collection of any Bruce Lee enthusiast, and I highly recommend it!",1283731200,,738,4.568181818181818
