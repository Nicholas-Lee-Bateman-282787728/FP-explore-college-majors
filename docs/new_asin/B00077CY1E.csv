Takes you thru the castle and views froM above, below, everything including statuary, decor, the lake and the river.  Still has the original artwork.",1291680000,,266,4.595744680851064
8045449,5,B00077CY1E,"While one reviewer was upset this DVD would not play on US players, viewers need to know that PAL DVDs will typically play on most computer DVD players, as this does on mine. This is a beautifully produced documentary featuring stunning photography and competent historical scholarship. Anyone who has actually seen Neuschwanstein and the neighboring castle Hohenschwangau in Bavaria in person as I have should love this DVD.  The setting is incredibly beautiful in its scenic qualities, and the castle itself might well be among the wonders of the world, drawing many thousands of tourists to visit it year round. It is one of the top tourist attractions of Germany. A certain sign of the excellent quality of this DVD is that one is left with a huge desire to see more after viewing it, and anyone like me will return to view it many times. I only wish I were lucky enough to live there year round!",1264809600,,900,4.69620253164557
8045450,1,B00077CY1E,"Looking forward to this DVD. Was I surprised when I put it in my DVD player, and it wouldn't play. Discovered it was PAL formatted for Europe, not NTSC formatted for USA. Called Amazon customer service and was told that the NTSC format was not available. So I am shipping the DVD back to Amazon for a refund.",1171065600,4,308,4.327586206896552
8045451,5,B00077CY1E,"A fitting tribute to a beautiful piece of architecture.  Since I have never been to Neuschwanstein, this was a great substitute.  I wish there were more still photos of all the FINISHED and UNFINISHED rooms... I am still waiting for the definitive edition of Neuschwanstein.  What is at the top of those turrets... what is in the basement... ?  Of course if they showed you everything you wouldn't want to go and visit the thing... however... if you are like me... it only sparks your curiousity more.  Nice DVD...",1128038400,4,514,4.730337078651686
