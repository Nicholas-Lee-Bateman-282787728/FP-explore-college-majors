TCM is always generous with the extra features.  Background information and extra short features make the films fun to watch.  The price is also very reasonable.  This is a good way to see 4 excellent films.",1484611200,,431,4.3924050632911396

5152996,5,B008D1R52E,I have been to plenty of DVD stores in my time to find good old classics and what they consider classics I do not. The actors from this generation out do the over paid actors of today. Jimmy Stewart in every movie I have watched him in acts with such passion and never seems to fail. You can`t find acting like that anymore without all the crudeness. The only actor today that would resemble any good acting would be Tom Hanks.,1470700800,5,427,4.283950617283951

5153004,5,B008D1R52E,"Whats not to like here? It's Jimmy Stuart and a couple of his good movies as well as the films being re-mastered to make them better than the originals I guess. They're NOT high-definition or blu-ray, but good enough you aren't distracted by poor quality so they're pretty darn good.
I love the old films and this has a couple of the best ones. ""Shop Around The Corner is out-standing.",1460937600,5,385,4.514285714285714

But, I couldn't find one and ended up buying this 4-pack of James Stewart classics.  I haven't watched all 4 DVDs yet.  I watched Little Shop Around The Corner for the umpteenth time - love that movie.  Watched the FBI Story which was long and pretty boring.  I started watching Spirit of St Louis which is good, but I didn't finish watching it yet and I haven't watched the 4 DVD yet.  Finding Little Shop Around the Corner (since it's not being reproduced anymore) was great.  I would have missed it a lot if I have not been able to replace it, and getting 3 more movies....that was a bonus.",1457395200,6,688,4.206106870229007

5153066,5,B008D1R52E,"I bought this to get ""The Spirit of St Louis"" having watched it and enjoyed it many times over the years. Like many of my favorite movies I read the story as a young man, his struggles to take off, stay awake, the icing problems, etc show the difficulties to achieve the first successful Atlantic crossing by airplane.  The rest of the movies were pure frosting on the cake, as Jimmy Stewart is always worth watching!",1411430400,7,417,4.4868421052631575
5153067,5,B008D1R52E,"I love Jimmy Stewart. So these movies are a nice collection. The Shop Around The Corner is a good movie and the original You've Got Mail. The Wizard of Oz fans may recognize Mr. Stewart's boss in this movie, who is played by the Wizard himself. The Stratton Story is a great film about a ball player who rises to the top, but then loses his leg through a traffic accident. He manages to go back to playing again in a marvelous story of triumph through the worst circumstances. The F.B.I. Story is an action packed thriller with just about all the 30s and 40s gangsters. And finally we come to The Spirit of St. Louis. This is a fantastic film by director Billy Wilder, it shows just exactly what Charles Lindbergh went through to become the first man to cross the Atlantic in a non stop solo flight.

Besides the films themselves, another selling point is the bonus features on these discs. Each film contains original trailers and some contain vintage premiere footage (on which many familiar faces are seen, especially for The Spirit of St. Louis). Another interesting bonus feature is an original Joe McDoakes comedy short. Starring George O' Hanlon (George Jetson on the Jetsons) and Phyllis Coates (Lois Lane on the first season of The Adventures of Superman) and is directed by Richard L. Bare (the director of Green Acres, who is still living by the way at the age of 102).",1410393600,25,1380,4.609756097560975

His voice is unique and recognizable no matter what he is doing.  Whether during his western period of Shenandoah or the war years with Strategic Air Command.

""The Spirit of St. Louis"" is likewise based on Charles Lindbergh's flight over the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. Lindbergh himself served as an advisor on the film. ""The FBI Story"" follows an agent (Jimmy Stewart) throughout his career beginning in the 1920's and references some actual cases and events from the actual FBI.
