Sometimes that is a joy and a treat and sometimes they're as terrible as the worst we have to offer in the states. For the most part they usually end up somewhere in the middle. The fact is that the difference in cultures becomes greatly apparent in the storytelling from one country to another. Still, it allows us the opportunity to open our eyes to new things, to experience films from a different perspective.

That being said there is DOBERMAN COP, a starring vehicle for Japanese actor Sonny Chiba whose claim to fame in the states comes from his starring roles in the Streetfighter movies. Based on the Manga of the same name he stars as a fish out of water, a police detective from the backwoods city of Okinawa. Backwoods at least to those who live in Tokyo where he is now, searching for a missing girl who was supposed to have traveled here. He has a personal motivation to find her as a psychic back home told him the two of them were to be married.

Of course the local police laugh him off and suggest he return home to let the real police solve this missing persons case. Instead he remains in town, makes friends with a few shady characters and searches for the girl on his own. It takes little time to realize that the girl has been taken under the wing of a local yakuza boss who has plans for her to be a new pop singing sensation that he will control and manage. Kept in line with a steady flow of drugs, she is a total addict and has no plans on leaving.

Chiba eventually finds her and tries to rescue her but is stopped by the boss and his gang. Deals and double crosses, never knowing who to trust, it seems that every side has someone working both sides of the street. Whether or not he succeeds in his task is eventually solved by the end of the film.

While watching this I couldn't help but think back to the movie COOGANS BLUFF starring Clint Eastwood in a similar vein as an AZ sheriff sent to New York to extradite a captured criminal and the TV series MCCLOUD which starred Dennis Weaver in a role based on that film. The fish out of water backwater lawman who teaches the city cops a thing or two ran through both of those items just as it does here. What makes it interesting to watch is Chiba in the role. For the most part his films had him as more urban and violent than this one where he has a somewhat country bumpkin persona he uses to help people underestimate his abilities.

The movie isn't quite Hollywood clean but the print is very good considering the source. Japan in the seventies in on display here and reminds one more of Times Square at the time than the serene images most garner from Tokyo. Its almost a modern day Tombstone with criminals having no problems carrying and using guns while the police seem unable to corral anyone that should be, focusing instead on suspects that are far easier to catch and deal with.

As with all releases from Arrow Video the contents make this one for movie lovers to enjoy and fans of Chiba to love. Included in the extras are Beyond the Film: Doberman Cop a new appreciation by director Kinji Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane, a new interview with Shinichi Sonny Chiba, a new interview with screenwriter Koji Takada, a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork by Chris Malbon and with the first pressing only an illustrated collectors book. All of this comes together to prove why Arrow Video is a name to be reckoned with when it comes to quality product.",1502323200,,3618,4.408682634730539
8697547,4,B00S8087FE,"Japanese culture is complicated enough on its own.  So when a movie starts lifting elements of Hollywood genres and pop culture iconography, it can be flat-out frustrating to try and make sense out of who's stealing what from whom!  Luckily, a film like Doberman Cop (1977) doesn't require a whole lot of critical analysis.  Sonny Chiba stars as Kano, a backwards island cop on loan to the Tokyo police force to help identify a dead body.  Initially dismissed as a country bumpkin, Kano soon steals the show in pursuit of a serial killer whose next target looks to be the rising star of a national singing competition.

While his Battles Without Honor and Humanity series was a huge hit, director Kinji Fukasaku was sweating out the demise of the yakuza genre along with several other studios whose endless series of sequels seemed to have finally played out.  Doberman Cop is an obvious franchise attempt - based on a popular manga - that never got off the ground.  But even as a one-off, Fukasaku takes a unique hard-boiled approach, mixed with some fish-out-of-water comedy, that makes it unusually appealing.

Opening with the gruesome discovery of a prostitute's burned body, Kano arrives on the scene traveling with a pet pig which he offers to the police captain in tribute.  It's a hokey gimmick that seems at odds with the plot that develops around Miki (Janet Hatta), an ex-junkie turned singer whose career is micromanaged by an ambitious yakuza.  But bouncing between comedy and pulp fiction cliches keeps the film oddly interesting.  After a neon soaked, bluesy beginning, Doberman Cop splits its time between on-the-money faux film noir plot twists and Dirty Harry style stunts and violence courtesy of a signature .44 magnum.

Sonny Chiba seems more engaged here than in some of his other '70s cop thrillers, including Arrow Video's recent Wolf Guy.  And his comfort level with the character of Kano rubs off, even when a street-tough sidekick is added to give the movie some more youth appeal.  The stunts themselves, including a dizzying sequence repelling down a highrise building, are only slightly above average.  But Fukasaku seems more patient here, letting the story play out to a satisfyingly nihilistic conclusion that could have been lifted right out of a post-WW2 detective story...and probably was.

Arrow Video does a great job bringing Doberman Cop onto hi-def, with a Blu-ray transfer that on par with any of their previous releases...and maybe a hair better.  Extras include a ""video appreciation"" by Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane (who does a great job setting up the state of Japanese cinema at the time), new interviews with Sonny Chiba and screenwriter Koji Takada along with newly commissioned artwork and a standard-DVD copy.",1500595200,,2765,5.041758241758242
8697548,4,B00S8087FE,"Let me be perfectly upfront, I wouldnt usually watch Doberman Cop, but Arrow Video shot it over my way for review, so alas here I am with this feeble excuse for a review. The reason I wouldnt watch it has nothing to do with it being a bad or good film, but only because it isn't something that jumps out at me as a must watch. I still feel the same way even after watching the film. Of course, I know my opinion doesnt mean squat, as others have expressed liking the movie (check out The Moon is a Dead Worlds review). As for me, I felt the film was a bit muddled when it comes to the story, resulting in wacky, confusing story and an ending that falls flat.

REVIEW

Doberman Cop is about a country bumpkin detective (Chiba), who has a pig for a friend and is amazing at his job, even though he looks homeless. He comes to Tokyo when the body of a missing friend/lover/wife(?) has turned up. He gets wrapped up in a potential serial killer case, strippers and lounge singers.

Doberman Cop is all over the place and has a hard time keeping its story straight. First, its murder with no connections, then it has connections to a serial killer, and then a banger gang shows up. Next, we have strippers and lounge singers working with an ex Yakuza. The flick tries very hard to tie all of this together, which does generate a few surprises, but I still ended up with a feeling of mehness (its a real word). Its sad that the Japanese film industry was starting to wane, but its clear Doberman Cop was not going to save it.

Arrow Video doesnt care whether I like the movie or not and provides a package for everyone else that loves it. The Blu-ray is a bit on the light side when it comes to special features, but does provide an interesting 8-minute interview with Sadao Yamane, who discusses the decline of Japanese cinema. We also have the continuing interview with Sonny Chiba (part one was featured on Wolf Guy). There are no commentaries, which is surprising, but at least the solid video and audio make up for the shortage of features.

VERDICT

Maybe I was in a bad mood when I watched Doberman Cop, and if I was to gave it another chance, heck, I may end up liking it better. As the saying goes, opinions are like appendixes. We all have them until they explode and kill you.

Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Chiba and Japanese crime films, Arrow Video has the Blu-ray for you.

Note: I cant be the only one that thought this movie was going to be a half man, half Doberman running around Tokyo solving crimes. I cant be, right? Right? Hello? Is this thing on?",1500508800,,2568,4.324324324324325
8697549,5,B00S8087FE,"Doberman Cop originally started out as a gekiga, a drama manga in Japan written by Buronson and known in its native language as Doberman deka. While Kinji Fukusakus 1977 crime/exploitation film shares the same name and inspiration as the manga, the actual elements differ quite vastly from the source material. Here, screenwriter Koji Takada turns Doberman dekas main character into an Okinawan countryman full of superstition and emotional turmoil rather than a hardboiled Tokyo cop, placing him in a populated city as he attempts to solve the murder (?) of a woman from his hometown. Doberman Cop is a strange film full of character and interesting plotting, and Fukusakus thriller finds a niche within the late 70s slowly-fading crime genre.

The film follows the titular Doberman cop (thus named confusingly because of his dog-like fighting skills, although he generally goes by the nickname Tarzan) Joji Kano (Sonny Chiba), an Okinawan investigating the murder of a woman named Yuna from his hometown. His detective work leads him to Tokyo, where he eventually uncovers a yakuza-esque ring run by a music producer attempting to shoot up-and-coming singer Miki Haruno (Janet Hatta) into the spotlight by paying everyone off so that she wins Japans A Star is Born game show. Motorcycle gangs, pigs in backpacks, and on-stage stripper sex abound in this films crazy plot as Joji Kano questions whether Miki is actually the murdered Yuna.

As I stated, Fukusakus Doberman Cop is an exploitation crime film, but it often sheds the normalcy of those kinds of plots for a very wacky ride. The films direction emphasizes a quick pacing, and Fukusaku spends little time on characterization and even the initial murder of an Okinawan girl before Chibas Joji Kano is on the case. But Doberman Cops appeal comes from Chibas character as he becomes more nuanced throughout the film; hes not a normal Tokyo cop  as the films theme often points out  and his supernatural beliefs stemming from a country area like Okinawa allow him to investigate and work outside of normal police procedures that halt their progress on the case.

With that said, viewers may find the film difficult to parse, at least in its opening half hour. The plot doesnt really kick into gear until Kano eventually comes into contact with Miki and a young motorcycle gangbanger named Hotshot (Kichi Iwaki), where Kanos motivations become a much more important part of the story. Kano, coming from a close-knit community, feels a connection to his neighbor Yuna and her death, and when he discovers that Miki is most likely the presumed-dead Yuna, he becomes obsessed with tracking down the serial murderer who seems to be killing off everyone who knows something about her.

Doberman Cop is quite complex, then, because its not just operating on a plot about a masked-and-gloved killer. The crux of the plot involves finding that man, but Doberman Cop continues on after that element has been solved  Fukusakus main focus is on Miki, who has shed her past identity because of an abusive agent who wields power over her due to her drug use. The films conclusion is quite sad, too, as Kano fails to save Miki from her life: drugged against her will, Miki ends up winning A Star is Born and becoming a celebrity even though the Yuna that she used to be is long gone. Theres pathos here as Chibas character uses his shell magic to figure out whether Yuna is dead or alive; before, she had always come up alive, but after Miki wins the competition, he realizes that shes no longer the same person.

One thing that does detract from the films focus on Miki/Yunas character is Janet Hattas acting, which doesnt always hit the mark in the film. Granted, Fukusaku spies on her in various states of weeping or drug withdrawals, but her presence feels weak considering the rest of the strong cast. Even her singing scenes clearly punctuate her lip-syncing, since shes giving little effort to the performance.

Doberman Cop isn't the usual yakuza gangster film. Its got a lot of odd craftiness to it including several music performances and weird character tics; and yet that helps Fukusakus film stand out from films of that ilk (even some that Fukusaku previously directed). Doberman Cop is truly an entertaining watch, and fans of hardboiled crime films in the vein of Dirty Harry will appreciate the infusion of Japanese culture in this style.

Arrow Video has released Doberman Cop in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack. The film gets two discs, with reversible cover artwork and a book of essays about the film and the Doberman Cop legacy as a whole (including a TV series and the subsequent sequel film).

The Blu-Ray features a new high-definition transfer that looks quite good - there's a lot of color presence within the film itself which shows in the image, as well as great blacks and night sequences. There are occasional burns and debris but it has been cleaned up nicely, and ultimately this film looks excellent on Blu-Ray especially for those who have never seen it before. One thing that does become enhanced on this transfer is the presence of blown-out lighting, although it seems like this is an intentional part of the film and almost acts as a metaphor for Miki's shot at ""star""dom.

Audio is presented with an LPCM 2.0 track and sounds good with no muffling, hissing, or other unwarranted sounds. It's not a very memorable track but certainly gets the job done for this disc.

Special features included on the Blu-Ray are two interviews and an introduction from biographer Sadao Yamane. The latter is a 9 minute conversation about Doberman Cop and Kinju Fukusaku's prior works; the former both run about 17 minutes, and include interviews with both Sonny Chiba and screenwriter Koji Takada. Chiba talks about his friendship with Fukusaku before really getting into some of the interesting aspects of Doberman Cop like its focus on Okinawan life, while Takada discusses the differences between his writing on the script and the manga as well as changes that Fukusaku requested. There's also a theatrical trailer included.

In terms of content and extras, Doberman Cop is a good release with a surprising amount of new features to check out despite the lack of audio commentaries. The transfer looks good and mimics many of the other Japanese feature films Arrow has previously released, and viewers can't go wrong picking up this extremely entertaining crime drama.",1500422400,,6429,4.935245143385754
8697550,3,B00S8087FE,"Doberman Cop,"" made in 1977, reunited director Kinji Fukasaku with star Shinichi Sonny Chiba in an American-style crime movie that mixes gunplay and pulp fiction with martial arts and broad comedy to create one of their most entertaining films.

Based on manga  the popular Japanese comic book and graphic novel style  Doberman Cop follows the fish-out-of-water adventures of Joji Kano (Chiba), a tough police officer from Okinawa who arrives in Tokyos Kabuki-cho nightlife district to investigate the brutal murder and mutilation of an island girl who had been working as a prostitute. Initially dismissed as a country bumpkin (complete with straw hat and live pig in tow), Kano soon proves himself a more savvy detective than the local cops, and a tougher customer than anyone expected.

As he probes deeper into the sleazy world of flesh peddling, talent agency corruption and mob influence, Kano uncovers the shocking truth about the girl, her connection to a yakuza-turned-music manager, and an elusive serial killer who is burning women alive.

The film has lots of fight scenes filmed with quick cutting to heighten excitement. Chibas Kano is as adept with a handgun as he is with his fists and feet, and this is shown in one of the movies more graphic and violent scenes. Though the film isn't up to Fukasakus other work, its fun to watch Chiba in a role that combines his athletic prowess with his ability to deliver a funny line.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD release include new video interviews with actor Shinichi Sonny Chiba and screenwriter Koji Takada; the making-of featurette Beyond the Film: Doberman Cop; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork. The film is in Japanese, with optional English subtitles.",1499299200,2,1770,5.107266435986159
