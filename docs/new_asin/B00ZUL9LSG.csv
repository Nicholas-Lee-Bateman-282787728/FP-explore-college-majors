8720937,5,B00ZUL9LSG,"This is a well made documentary about Dale Earnhardt and his career in NASCAR.  A must see for any fan of the Intimidator. It doesn't sugar coat his aggressive driving but gives insight as to why he was so driven on and off the track.  From his early days in Winston Cup and some pretty amazing antics on the track, all the way to his first and only Daytona 500 win, it tells his story.  It still brings tears to my eyes watching every member of every team rushing onto pit row to slap the hand of Dale as he celebrated his win after so many tries only to come up short on the last lap.  Sadly, he was taken on the last lap of the track that was so tough on him, but he died doing something we never saw him do before: blocking for his driver Mike and his son Dale Jr as they battled for the win.  Probably the only unselfish act on the track Dale ever did. Gone too soon.",1483056000,5,872,3.9885057471264367
