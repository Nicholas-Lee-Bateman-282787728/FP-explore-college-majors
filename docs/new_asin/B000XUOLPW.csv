8229920,2,B000XUOLPW,"Only buy this collection if you are a fan of 80's styled horror films regardless of quality. I purchased this collection due to the fact that I love 80's horror films and hadn't heard of any of the movies included in this collection. Unfortunately, I quickly found out why.",1443571200,,273,4.591836734693878
8229921,3,B000XUOLPW,"To my surprise, when I got the set I found the back cover says ""3 Disc Set - 6 Films!""  Luckily after opening the set and checking the FOUR discs included, I found that Amazon's listing above is correct. The set does include those 7 movies, along with an English version of ""Don't Panic"" as well as the Spanish version.  The back cover also only lists 6 movies, leaving off 'Demon Rat', but it is there on disc 3.  So, 8 movies on 4 discs, not 6 on 3.  Kind of sloppy on BCI's part but, it all works out.",1198022400,4,504,4.01
