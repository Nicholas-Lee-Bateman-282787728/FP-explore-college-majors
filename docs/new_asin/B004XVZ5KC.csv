8447472,5,B004XVZ5KC,"Superb value.  With some nice surprises.

I also still have my VHS copy of this movie.....There is no comparing the audio/video quality.  This dvd is excellent.

The additional footage and editing were acceptable..

You cant pass up the low price on this gem.....unless you really prefer watching a cloudy, poorly produced HVS tape...for the sake of historical accuracies.....but that's entirely up to you.",1406419200,2,406,5.380952380952381
8447473,3,B004XVZ5KC,"After seeing Flo & Eddie perform in Frank Zappa's ""200 Motels,"" you will never feel the same about The Turtles.",1373846400,,111,4.6
8447474,5,B004XVZ5KC,"The dvd was colorized. Not what I expected. I think I would have enjoyed the cd better.  It was like I was on a trip someplace else and the plays were kind of funny but strange.  Flickering colored lights everywhere. It's all up to the individual. All in all, I really enjoyed watching it and I could still remember all the songs from way back when.  Many years ago.  If you are into Zappa, then I would highly recommend this outrageous dvd.  Enjoy watching it.  It's a little off the wall, but quite funny in it's own way.  Zappa looks fantastic in this movie.",1373328000,,561,4.336538461538462
8447475,5,B004XVZ5KC,"Zappa silliness at it's best! When Groupies were famous! Larry the Dwarf- Keith Moon as an OD nun? How ironic- & weird! And I bet your Mom never thought of ""The Turtles"" were this Happy Together!!  (& Ansley Dunbar is SO BRITISH!) Mohahnis makes me want a Cheeseburger. If you love Frank -this is a must have- w/a vile, foaming liquid, of course... ""MUSIC IS THE BEST"" (FZ)",1372550400,,373,4.485294117647059
8447476,1,B004XVZ5KC,"bad aspect ratio conversion...bad edits that were NOT in the original production and a commentary track that is self absorbed and tedious.
save yer $$s and go find and old vid tape. do the conversion yourself.",1360627200,6,209,4.833333333333333
