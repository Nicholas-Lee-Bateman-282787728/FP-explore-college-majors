8428413,5,B004FZMDTC,"There are many Civil War dvds so decisions have to be made and as usual I sent for the right one. This arrived early and in no time I had commenced to watch each disc and not for the last time as worthy of repeat viewing. Have completed three discs ,but I am pacing myself with great constrained effort. It is the next best thing to actually re-enacting at the actual battle fields and the different
ways of presentation reveals more than the usual approach of making film of this kind. Makes it stand out from the others.
I have passed on the excitement of this to other buffs and they will add it to their collections. Untold Secrets of the Civil War cannot remain secret. I must share with other buffs so I can be rewarded further by their thank yous for making them aware of the above.
Keep up the good work----------------Thanks  Pete R.",1369872000,8,842,4.397435897435898
