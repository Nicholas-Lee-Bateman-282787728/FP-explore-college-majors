7900917,5,8190952609,"If you can't spare 24 minutes than your time management is not perfect, if you can't follow such simple technique to stay healthy and energetic, you need to spare time to visit your doctor more often. The RSM's Yoga DVD rescheduled my daily routine and rejuvenated the Body, Mind and Soul. The technique is very simple and effective, the instructions sounds live and Asanas and warm up stretch patterns automatically involve breathing exercises, oxygenating the entire cellular structure of our body. Thanks Yoga, Thanks RSM and Thanks Ujjain Yogalife Society.",1440892800,,560,5.233333333333333

7900919,5,8190952609,"I know the Yog teacher personally and learned this routine (and much more) from him. I know many many people who have been practicing it, are ardent followers and have benefited immensely from it in various ways.

This is a comprehensive and relatively easy set of exercises (especially for beginners) that includes Aasans, Pranayams and Dhyaan at the same time (if done right) and addressing all major parts of the body. Start doing it, do it for 7 days and I promise you wouldn't want to stop it.

I rarely write reviews (in fact this is probably my first one on Amazon), but I am doing so for this Yoga routine because I know this can be a start for many in positive direction that can impact almost every aspect of your life positively and create a solid foundation for generations to come. Trust me on this :)",1383177600,,814,4.493243243243243

This is the best yoga package for busy people and as it is written on the cover - 'Self Taught', you really can practice by yourself. Instructions are clear and can easily be followed. The Yoga postures can be practiced by any one, all simple postures. Breathing instruction are also very nicely included in the video. The free book, which comes with the DVD is very useful for the time when I don't have a DVD player, computer or laptop. This is overall a best yoga video product I have seen in the market.",1368662400,,552,4.368932038834951
7900923,5,8190952609,"I've been practicing yoga for few years before this. But there is something simple yet very powerful about this particular routine. Warm up exercises and postures on this DVD are carefully hand-picked, and seem to cater perfectly for those of us with sedentary lifestyle. Instructions are very clear and as if the teacher is watching you perform the Asanas. Its fast pacing somehow brings new energy instead of tiring you out!. Amazing stuff, thank you RSM :-)",1368662400,2,460,4.987012987012987
7900924,5,8190952609,"I am not big time in yoga. however, I do want to live a healthy life. I tried doing kickboxing and aerobics with my aim to maintain a fit body. However, due to time commitments and other reasons I slowly pulled myself out of it. I did try out Yoga in the past but found it to be very boring. And then I got this dvd. I tried it out and found it to be easy, yet very powerful. My whole body has transformed in a very positive way since I have made this dvd a part of my life. I pretty much remember all the postures after 1 month of practicing but still prefer to play the dvd anyways since it has a very nice music playing in the background and the instructor's voice keeps reminding me about the correct postures even when I am not looking at the screen.
24 min of yoga for 24 hours of energy is a perfect fit in my busy lifestyle and for me is 'God sent'. I highly recommend this DVD to all busy professional out there.",1368662400,,921,3.983783783783784
