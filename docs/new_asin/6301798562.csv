370783,5,6301798562,"10 HUGE STARS FOR THIS CLASSIC!  BETTE IS DYNAMIC, AS ALWAYS!  OLIVIA IS SWEETLY SINISTER! AGNES STEALS THE SHOW!  VICTOR IS OVERPOWERING, EVEN IN A SMALL ROLE! PLEASE, DON'T EVEN THINK ""REMAKE!"" WOULD ANYONE  ATTEMPT TO REPLICATE THE HOPE DIAMOND?  I DON'T THINK SO!",954633600,2,267,4.9772727272727275
370784,5,6301798562,"""Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" is one of THE finest examples of a psychological drama. In the tradition of Cukor's ""Gaslight"" and ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"" the sympathetic heroine is  nearly driven insane by a ""well-meaning"" relative dripping with  arsenic. Bette Davis is at her versatile and incredibly engrosssing best as  the vulnerable post-Southern belle Charlotte Hollis, who for over thirty  years has carried the memory of a dead flame who was married at the time of  his bizzare death. When Charlotte's late father's mansion is to be  destructed, Charlotte calls for help from sweet cousin Miriam. But Miriam  is not as sweet as she makes out to be... she is in fact manipulating and  evil, and played by (BIG SURPRISE, but darn well) Olivia deHavilland. Don't  expect sweet Cousin Melanie when there is a vulnerable cousin... and  millions of dollars at stake. As Charlotte is driven out of her fragile  mind, she begins to come to terms with the death of her lover...and begins  to see Miriam for what she is.  From its intriguing beginning shot on the  Southern gothic palace, to the  ending haunting tones of its title song,  ""Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" is a film you won't soon forget.",953164800,5,1214,4.906403940886699
370785,4,6301798562,"This is a good, creepy horror movie, although the plot is a big old mess.  Bette Davis is quite annoying-- she was so good in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" that she almost seems over-confident here.  She just  hams it up, and it gets annoying.  Olivia De Havilland, on the other hand,  is brilliant.  There's something incredibly engrossing-- almost amusing--  at how harsh and bitchy she is.  What adds to the amusing quality of her  character is the datedness of her hair and clothing (she's supposed to seem  very chic and fashionable, but by 1965 standards).  Anyway, I think Olivia  proves to be just as good a villain as any woman in any movie-- she's  convincingly vile.  And as much as I like Joan Crawford, I don't think she  would have done as good a job in the role.  I remember seeing the film as a  child and being freaked out when Miriam beats up Charlotte in the car.  This was a VERY violent and harsh scene back in those days-- especially for  a female role.",953078400,5,979,4.4602272727272725
370786,5,6301798562,"I love old movies, and this beats them all. Betty Davis puts on a stunning performance that lets you peek into a person's mind who has carried the guilt of being responsible for a would be husbands death. You don't know  until the end if she is really responsible or not, and always in your heart  hoping that it isn't true.",946684800,,324,4.295081967213115
370787,5,6301798562,"""HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE"" is my 3rd favorite movie ever. My 2 favorite are Joan Crawford films. I agree with the other reviewer. As great an actress as Joan Crawford was, she would not have been the BEST  Miriam. Olivia de Havilland's brilliance in the role of Miriam is the way  she  played with understatement. That's what makes the psychological abuse  inflicted on Charlotte so chilling...Miriam is unbelievably believable  right up to the very last. Had Joan Crawford gotten into a power struggle  via the camera, the whole film would have suffered. She would have had to  keep too much charisma, strength, and presence pumping to hold her own with  Bette Davis (which she was ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF DOING). Someday, if it still  exists, 20th Century-Fox Video would be able to make a mint by releasing  the unreleased film footage shot with Joan Crawford. Agnes Moorehead is  excellent as Velma Ca--rothers: ""Shooo-weeee! She ain't nothin' but a  chiiiiiild..."" This is my favorite Bette Davis performance (a close  tie with ""Deception"" from 1946). Joseph Cotton's and Mary Astor's  roles could have been walked through by just about anyone, so you can't  blame the actors. All in all, you just can't beat ""Hush...Hush, Sweet  Charlotte"" for putting the ""fun"" back into dysfunctional  family reunions. Show it at YOUR next one! Hopefully, 20th Century-Fox  Video or Key Video will get around to repackaging this title soon. The box  artwork has not changed since...well, since about 1964!",943833600,45,1496,5.107438016528926
370788,4,6301798562,"An ageing Southern Belle - who lives in broken-down gentility - is haunted by the unsolved murder of her lover which took place back in 1927...Joan Crawford was to play Miriam Deering but was replaced with Olivia when she feigned illness. (She was overwhelmed, they say, by the no nonsense Davis). In some respects, I like this movie better than Baby Jane, in others not as much. I think Agnes Moorehead delivered a great - if hammy - performance as Velma Cruther. It would have been good fun watching Crawford as Miriam, but Olivia does very well. When director Aldrich approached de Havilland, to take the role, she flat out said ""No"". What eventually persuaded her to take the part was the idea of playing Miriam charmingly and ladylike; this, de Havilland said, was an assignment no actress worth her salt could refuse. I wonder how Crawford would have played her? I thought it was obvious that it was really Davis playing Charlotte in some of the 1927 scenes and, of course, it wasn't convincing at all. I agree with Davis when she thought the scene with the head rolling down the stairs was a BIT much, but one of Bette's best hysterical scenes is when - on the staircase - looking like a crazed animal - she is told to ""hush...hush, sweet Charlotte"" while she's being petted by the conniving Miriam. Mary Astor actually gives one of the best performances in the whole film; in the key role of Jewel Mayhew; she is very real in her interpretation of faded southern finery who's ""stoney broke"". Like Baby Jane, the movie is too long. Patti Page had a surprise hit singing the title song as a love song.",943833600,3,1607,4.583333333333333

One small correction, however, Joan  Crawford was to play Miriam, however, she magically came down with the flu  and refused to leave her trailer for 6 weeks on location, after finding out  that she (Crawford) would not recieve top billing. Hence, Olivia Dehaviland  (aka Melanie Wilkes) got to break out of the mold of the""mealy-mouthed  ninny Melaine"" and sink her gifted teeth into the role of one of the  coldest bitches ever captured on celluloid.",929750400,3,783,4.58273381294964

370915,5,6301798562,"Having seen this film several, borderline numerous times, I snapped up this little number when I heard it was on Blu Ray.  Beyond the movie, there are several bonus featurettes, only two of which I've seen thus far, but those alone are an indication that this is a 5-star package.  The first is an interview with Bruce Dern who has some very entertaining stories and recollections about Bette Davis, Robert Aldrich and Victor Buono.  The second, which was a huge draw for me buying this disc, is a mini-documentary about the hassles of trying to work with Joan Crawford when she was set to play Cousin Miriam.  I mostly nodded and muttered ""uh-huh"" when the narrative broached point after point, having seen it brilliantly portrayed in Feud-Bette & Joan.  This featurette includes several stills of Joan acting with Agnes Moorehead, Joseph Cotten and MIZZ Davis herself.  I wish there were actual film clips of Joan's performance, but the stills are nice as well.  I also wish Joan had finished the film with everyone else, but she and MIZZ Davis made it impossible.  It's very entertaining, funny, etc., as a fan, to listen to stories about their rivalry and feud, but as a human being, I really wish they could have cut the crap.  Did Joan really need to scheme against MIZZ Davis throughout the Oscars?  While I don't blame MIZZ Davis for being angry about this, did she have to be so hell-bent on revenge?  After all, they were middle-aged women who could have benefited handsomely from a friendship, and from putting glamour and histrionics behind them.  These served them very well between Mildred Pierce, The Women, The Letter, Of Human Bondage, but they could have just cooled down and just be two women around each other who were both dealing with aging in the film industry and realizing it's not 1943 anymore.

Another reason I jumped on this was its limited release of only 3,000 copies, if I read correctly.  It's great for me because I already own a copy, but it's a shame for the other fans who might not know about this and could be missing out.  The 20th Century DVD is okay, but not as good as this.",1516665600,6,2117,4.653225806451613

Charlotte's cousin, Miriam Deering ( Olivia de Havilland) reappears at the mansion after years of being abroad and with the help of the local Doctor ( Joseph Cotten ) offers to help Charlotte relocate.

370947,4,6301798562,"Among the earlier installments of Bette Davis' ""Grand Dame Guignol"" period, this blu-ray offers a heartfelt and only mildly exploitative thriller.

Ms. Davis dances between sincere, sorrowful moments and reckless, shrieking outbursts more reminiscent of her wilder moments from Baby Jane.  And Olivia DeHavilland is a revelation.  No spoilers.  Just watch her.  And Agnes Moorehead is camp incarnate, delivering a highly theatrical performance that is always likeable and welcome.

The picture quality for the most part is stunningly silky and almost sexy in its appeal to the eye.  Beautiful use of shadows and light that at times rivals the most carefully shot black & white classic films.

Special features include a behind-the-scenes documentary (including some stunning photographs of the early shooting days of ""Hush..."" when Joan Crawford was still starring alongside Ms. Davis) that chronicles the film from inception to box office grosses, a short but fun ""look back"" interview with Bruce Dern, and a classic featurette narrated by Joseph Cotten.",1509321600,,1055,5.509316770186335

371025,4,6301798562,"This past year a limited series ran called FEUD, this time around focusing on the behind the scenes feud between actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, a long standing personal battle that resulted in flaring tempers as the two tried to resuscitate their careers with the film WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. In the case of Crawford the result found her in some terrible movies while Davis went on to star in roles on TV and films. At the end of the series it discussed their reteaming under the same director, Robert Aldrich, for the film HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE. Their battle of wills resulted in Crawford being dismissed from the film and replaced by Olivia de Havilland and the film being completed. Why mention this? Because it provides an interesting backdrop when looking at the film now on blu-ray from Twilight Time.

The movie opens in 1927 in the antebellum south with a party being held by Charlotte Hollis father (Victor Buono). Charlotte has made plans to elope with her lover John (Bruce Dern) but before this takes place her father confronts John with the fact that he knows he is already married. Realizing he cant leave with Charlotte he breaks off with her. That same night someone takes a meat cleaver to John and Charlotte is thought to be behind the killing.

The story moves forward to 1964. The grand old house is in ruins and Charlotte lives their almost alone, an aging spinster with only Velma (Agnes Moorehead) there to keep her company. Times are worse than Charlotte realizes with the house set for demolition since a new highway is to be built here. Charlotte confronts the construction crew armed and after the sheriff intervenes is given days to move out.

Seeking help Charlotte has convinced her cousin Miriam (de Havilland) to return and help her. Arriving from New York Miriam does her best, renewing her romance with local doctor Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotton) and trying to help. But as the days pass it seems that Charlotte may have gone mad over the ensuing years since Miriam left. She sees images of John at night and fears that her father, the man she thought murdered John all those years ago, is back as well.

Something isn't quite right here and we as viewers know it. Velma does her best to keep Charlotte calm and suspects that something is amiss. But just who is behind it were not sure. Was John really murdered all those years ago? Did Charlotte actually do it and now is racked with guilt over her actions? Or is there some other mystery long buried over the years that is only now playing out?

The film offers a solid gothic style mystery, one where a number of potential solutions are presented. Davis performance would seem a bit on the hammy side if it weren't for the fact that the method she employs here adds credulity to the character of Charlotte and her eccentric ways. Aldrich, who moved on to bigger and better films like THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DIRTY DOZEN and THE LONGEST YARD does a great job of bringing his cast together to offer performances that are among their best.

If you read my reviews you may tire of hearing me saying this but yes, Twilight Time has brought a great looking offering here with a fantastic looking print. Theyve done a great job with extras this time around as well which include an isolated score track, audio commentary track with film historians David Del Vale and Steven Peros, audio commentary track with film historian Glenn Erickson, HUSHHUSH, SWEET JOAN: THE MAKING OF CHARLOTTE, BRUCE DERN REMEMBERS, Wizard Work, TV spots and the original theatrical trailers. As always its limited to just 3,000 copies so if you want one order today.",1503878400,,3650,4.6953125

371139,4,6301798562,"I want to add this to my collection--it's a Camp-Meets-Grand-Guignol classic. Some reviewers compare it unfavorably to the Aldrich/Davis collaboration ""Baby Jane"", but it's a completely separate story. While the plot is admittedly a bit of a stretch, it's highly watchable and the cast is obviously having a whale of a time chewing the scenery. Davis' rattled Charlotte may be unhinged but--unlike Baby Jane Hudson--you can sympathize with her. De Havilland, adept at portraying genteel ladies, just oozes insincerity as the opportunistic Miriam, and Joseph Cotten---every bit as effective, as the lecherous bayou MD---drawls one of my favorite movie quotes; ""now, there's nothin' wrong with basket-weavin'.....'course, it never cured anybody, but it's most therapeutic.""  This doesn't show up on the Critics' top ten lists, but it did garner several award nominations after its release, including one for Agnes Moorehead's scene-stealing housekeeper.

Great cast.  Great performances.  I always found Joseph Cotton creepy and never trusted DeHavilland.  Completely forgot about Agnes Moorehead's (I think too many think of her only as Endora from Bewitched or from the Twilight Zone...please watch Agnes here and in Caged) role in HHSC so that was a treat.

371337,3,6301798562,"Caution spoiler.  Betty Davis is wonderful, of course.  All the players in this film are stellar.  The real weakness of this movie is a very implausible plot.  If an elaborate ruse is perpetrated on a victim, it can't depend on knowing exactly what the victim will always do. e.g. pick up a gun and start shooting. And then say ""don't call the cops, let's just get rid of the body"". And then stare at the submerged body for a time no longer than he can hold his breath. Real life is complex.  And movie plots shouldn't drift this far from reality.  If you haven't seen ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane"", by all means, see that instead. That's a great Betty Davis movie with similar dynamics.",1473811200,,690,4.48
371338,4,6301798562,"Nominated for several Academy awards for supporting actress and several,others.  Betty Davis said she would not hide out when she got older,as some of her era did..  ""Im an actor and I will act,it is what I do.  I never considered myself a beauty anyway""

Many did however.  And those eyes are center stage again,but in a different way this time.  During the 70's Davis did several really good suspense ""horror"" movies,that were very well accepted.  This was the first of those.  And it is very good,with suspense and some very frightening scenes for the time.  I don't think modern audiences  will find it to disturbing,as heads and hands go rolling from an axe murderer that remains a mystery until the very end.

The story and direction are very good and the direction has a style of its own.  Many shots from above are a staple of this director.  It takes place in the south,in a mansion that is to be torn down for a highway project.  The mansion is the scene of a grisly murder 40 years before.
 While most believe they are certain they know who is responsible and why,the real events of the evening are not known until the end.

371417,5,6301798562,"It was my mom who urged me to get a copy of this film because she remembers how memorably creepy it was when she saw the film with my dad many years ago. In fact, she says my dad let out a scream inside the theater during one hair-raising scene! Anyway, I really had apprehensions getting this DVD copy since my thrust is to get all films in Blu-ray format for the clarity and resolution. But upon viewing the film this past weekend in it's present DVD format (no Blu-ray version yet), I was pleasantly surprised how clear the whole movie was which fit our 50"" TV screen perfectly. All in all, this was such a good purchase for me. Excellent film! I must admit I became an instant fan of screen icon Bette Davis who I only knew as the inspiration for the hit song Bette Davis Eyes after seeing this film. I researched on Bette and found out that she is one of Hollywood's greatest actresses and this film is solid proof that she is indeed a great actress. Her expressions, delivery of lines, nuances and characterization were compelling. Olivia de Havilland (who I heard was really best pals with Bette in real life) also sizzles in this movie but it is Bette's movie all throughout. Interesting to know that Olivia's role was really intended for Joan Crawford who was replaced because she allegedly got ""sick."" Joan had shot many scenes already so it would be interesting to see these scenes which hopefully could be included in the Blu-ray version of this fantastic movie. We saw the Blu-ray version of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane after this and I was astounded once again to see Bette in another role, this time as the scheming one, which proves her utmost versality and incredible range as an actress wherein she even dared to uglify herself with that bizarre make-up. Bette reminds me of the marvelous Meryl Streep who acts and looks differently in all her films which is the mark of a great actress.",1460419200,3,1908,4.549418604651163

It's also a sister film to Baby Jane (sharing many elements - including director and actors.)

1927~ Wealthy Hollis (VICTOR BUENO) only cares for his wealth and his daughter Charlotte. Hollis stops Mayhew (BRUCE DERN) a married man from taking Charlotte away to live with him and a life of social ruin.  But the plans turn DEADLY when Mayhew who ""rejected"" Charlotte is found chopped up with an AXE in the garden gazebo. Charlotte is the 'obvious killer'. Hollis..... has friends in high places and NO charges against Charlotte~ were ever made due to ""lack of evidence""....now 1964~37 years later~~~ and wealthy, elderly CANTANKEROUS Charlotte lives alone in the mansion with her maid.....(AGNES MOREHEAD) for company. The locals believe Charlotte is both a KILLER and ""crazy"". With the plantation soon to be ""bulldozed"" under an imminent domain......lovely cousin Miriam shows up.....(OLIVIA DEHAVAILAND) to help pack up Charlotte. Local Doctor Bayliss (JOSEPH COTTON) one of the few people Charlotte trusts is soon welcoming Miriam with open arms. Charlotte (BETTE DAVIS) is both old and bedraggled in this one. Her only comfort is her music box that plays a tune HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE.  When the maid/Agnes Morehead..... discovers Charlotte is being drugged by Miriam she sees a plot emerging ~ As Charlottes confusion and apparent madness increases under the drugs....  Morehead dies in a 'tumble down the stairs' ~~this sends Charlotte over the edge. Between her own craziness and the drugs she ""kills the good doctor"".....and relies on ""sweet Miriam"" to help dispose of the body. Secrets slowly come pouring out....including 37 years of blackmail, and Charlotte keeping silent all these years to help ""cover up' the murder she 'believes' her father committed. The plot is slow to unfold. The CAST is 5 STARS~ all the lead actors have won at least one Academy Award. Davis is excellent as the woman who barely holds on to reality let alone sanity but the scene stealer here is Miriam.  Who brings ""blackmail"" and scheming to a whole new level. This is a mystery, horror and thriller rolled in one neatly done package.

YES, IT'S in black and white as well it should be, that helps to give it a scarier and more graphic feel.
Also it's from the early-mid 1960's when films of this genre were shot mainly in black and white.
 I'm not a critic I just know what I like. This film has a great story line, I'm not going to give anything away
No spoilers,  just want anyone reading my review who hasn't had the opportunity to view this to get this
either on dvd or Amazon instant video which is what I have. Well acted , great lines, just worth watching.
It's not shown that much or cable or just your generic channels nor on netflix  so you might as well check it out on Amazon.

As always, Bette Davis brought her character to life.  It was a nice change to see Olivia de Havilland play the cunning Miriam.  She too brings her characters to life - in this movie spine shivering so!",1408060800,2,410,4.44
371833,5,6301798562,There isn't any role that Bette Davis can't play! Joan Crawford was originally cast to portray Miriam. She was unable to do so and was replaced by Olivia de Havilland. She did very well! I highly recommend this classic!,1407801600,,219,4.641025641025641
371834,5,6301798562,"I remember when tis film first came out. In 1964, I was a little girl, & much too young to go see it.  But later I did see it on tv.  SCARY!  I remember that Betty Davis was roundly slammed for making a ""B"" horror movie.  As if her career was as dead as' John' (played by baby-faced Bruce Dern!) the lover in the story.
But seeing it now as an adult, I have to say it exceeded my memories!  Davis is incredible!  Oscar-worthy as a Southern Belle gone crazy & how refreshing to see Olivia de Haviland acting like anything but  her famous ""Melonie"" in Gone with the Wind.
The story is built around a fascinating/creep-out mystery of how a handsome married man ended up gruesomely murdered way back in 1927.  (lol shame on the costume dept.--they did not bother with little details like the fact that NO women in the Roaring '20's wore 1960's ratted hair & shift dresses!)
5 Stars for the talented all -star cast, wonderful interesting script, & high-creep factor!  Fun at the movies!  Get the popcorn and blankets & have a blast with this black & white classic.  Watch for buck-toothed ""Dill"" from' To Kill a Mockingbird'--love the tacky kids' song"": Chop, chop Sweet Charlotte...chop off his hand & head!...""",1407628800,23,1207,4.541666666666667

371943,4,6301798562,This Gothic mystery is even better and more suspensful than I remember.  The solution to the mystery was still surprising.  This is a must-see if you like Bette Davis or the genre.,1395792000,2,180,4.59375
371944,5,6301798562,"""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" is wonderful Gothic camp in the same delicious category as ""What ever happened to Baby Jane?"" Only black and white can create the perfect atmosphere, the marvelous shadows, the dim recesses, the anguish upon a human face. All of the actors in this film are having a rollicking good time with their individual roles.  Agnes Moorehead as Velma the maid slops around in great style, her unwashed hair like dirty paper. She almost steals the show. Nobody can make an entrance like Bette Davis, and at the end of the film when she steps into her new life,  somewhat hesitant at first, then summoning her courage she actually makes the film viewer proud of her. She is carrying the music box, her murdered lover's gift to her but she ceremoniously leaves it on the hall table as that part of her life is over forever. Davis can make you understand what she is thinking even when there is no dialog her face, her body language are so expressive.

Olivia de Havilland as the seemingly sweet Cousin Miriam is nurturing a viper in her bosom and when the viper takes over her snarling face, the grimacing of her beautiful features, the nastiness to Charlotte are shocking. Did you recognize Victor Buono* who plays Daddy? He was Edwin Flagg, the erstwhile accompanist  Jane hired to stage her comeback as Baby Jane. Daddy is an autocrat with steely eyes, a whale of a man who brooks no disobedience. Joseph Cotten  seems to relish his role as Miriam's doctor boyfriend, just as evil as she is but with a fine facade of pseudo-respectability.

I really love the intimacy of a great film on my computer. It's just the two of us. These 1-click movies are very insidious so I neglect my housekeeping chores and agonize with Charlotte. I did not elect the HD version, but the quality of the ""plain"" film is  excellent. The superb photography is about five inches away from my face. Each character in the film literally casts a huge shadow, it looms on the wall or flutters up and down the magnificent spiral staircase. Flashes of lightening eerily illumine the gravestones next to the house and somewhere a dog barks endlessly. In an office the shadow of an overhead fan annoyingly flickers and flickers as though agitated as Velma is, trying to get help for her mistress  Charlotte. Faces peering through gauze curtains, or Velma's eyes peering through the slats of a closet door add greatly to the atmosphere. In a Gothic film atmosphere is everything and ""Hush, Hush will not let you down.

What takes place is an interesting dance of madness. What I liked about this classic movie was that it hadn't lost any of it's psychological power and the theme music adds to the madness.

372363,4,6301798562,"Bette Davis did such a good job of playing madwomen, didn't she? But is Charlotte Hollis really mad, or just a murderer who got away with it?

In 1927, John Mayhew (Bruce Dern) planned to elope with Charlotte Hollis, but her father Sam Hollis (Victor Buono, who always makes me think of Sidney Greenstreet) found out about it and put a stop to it. Mayhew met Charlotte in the summer house to tell her their elopement was off. As she runs out, she shouts ""I could kill you!"" Sure enough, within the hour he is dead, his right hand and head cut off. A meat cleaver went missing from the kitchen. So when Charlotte shows up at the party her father was giving with blood all down her pretty white dress, naturally everyone assumes she killed him. But Sam Hollis took her to England to ""get away from the reporters,"" and the sheriff concludes he does not have sufficient evidence to charge anyone with the crime. A year later, Big Sam dies and Charlotte inherits his huge estate, complete with large mansion and priceless furniture and art work.

Fast forward to 1964. The county has requisitioned Miss Charlotte's home to build a bridge and approach road to it. She holds off the bulldozers with a shotgun, but cousin Doctor Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotton) and cousin Miriam Deering (Olivia DeHaviland) insist there's nothing to be done, and she must move out. Her long-time servant, Velma Cruthers (Agnes Moorehead), doesn't trust them and believes that it should be possible to save the wonderful old house.

Charlotte is convinced that all her troubles are due to Jewel Mayhew (Mary Astor), the widow of John Mayhew. She believes that Jewel considers her a murderer and is trying to harm her in any way she can. By this time Jewel is a sick old lady. In fact, Miriam runs into her coming out of the local hospital, and is taken aback by the venom Mrs. Mayhew expresses toward her. It may not be clear why until later.

In fact, many of the incidents in this story seem disconnected and strange, but I promise you, they all add up by the closing credits. Not, I'm willing to bet, the way you expected.",1336867200,,2096,4.566489361702128

Yup.  This is what we get.

It's a helluva show.  Not grand.  Not even Guignol.  Just Davis as a besotted, mistaken ree-ree as events suddenly happen to her beyond her control.  Her house is being torn down to make way for a highway (there are no other roads in sight, so this was a faux pas).  Her house is big, grand, spooky, and the neighborhood boys know that.  And start off the film taunting her.

Poor Bette.  After all these years, she's now in drek like this and still being teased.  Is there no justice?

She plays full throttle and to hell with the rest of you.  Just try and keep up with her.  Agnes Moorhead, as Velma, is stupendous.  She's great and as over-the-top as Davis.  You sit back and marvel.

Then there's the rest of the cast.  Olivia de Havilland is lousy.  She just doesn't have the fire that Crawford would have brought to the role.  Wonderfully manipulative and sneaky but....but....well, you miss Crawford.  Sorry, Olivia.

And this was Olivia's really last good flick in movie-land.  And she was never an ""A"" list player to begin with, all those Errol Flynn rumors notwithstanding.  I hate virgins.

Victor Buono is ""too gay"", in my opinion.  Yeah, he can yell and scream, but you can see his type at the squat-and-gobble in Atlantic City or Orlando, Florida.  You know what I mean.

Bruce Dern has a thankless, though pivotal, role.  It's his decapitated hand that sets the wheels in motion.  And Davis rides the wheels like nobody's business.  She's practically sailing.

If Davis is sailing, than Mary Astor, in another pivotal role, sinks the film.  This is Mary Astor?  MARY ASTOR?????  She not only plays an old and broke woman, but the very sight of her tires us and makes us all feel old and broke.  And she's not kidding.  By this time in the rags of her career she WAS old and broke and it is embarassing to see this.  She does wonders with a small role, but that doesn't mean I want to look at it.

Davis' hysterical moments are always talked about: the screaming on the stairs, in the car, the dazed and confused woman wandering around her house (she had done nothing wrong, so why is this????)  It seems as though Charlotte can't make herself a grilled cheese sandwich.

And the head falling down the stairs.  Meh.  Just boring.

Still, after ""Baby Jane"" it was 20th Century Fox that bank rolled this endeavor, not Warner Brothers.  They spent an awful lot of money, but like I've always said: you can put a diamond necklace on a pig, and it's still a pig.

Sadly, this is what 20th attempted to do.  Oink oink.",1336435200,2,2779,4.578732106339468
372405,5,6301798562,"This is probably my favorite Bette Davis movie, after Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. Probably. It's hard to choose. (But then, there are others as well!) I just replaced my copy of this movie recorded off the TV with this DVD, but it seems I have to keep my copy as well, because I also recorded a really nice feature about the making of the movie. The DVD, however, has its own selection of really nice special features that I have not seen before. I was, for example, surprised to learn that that was Bette Davis playing herself in the beginning of the movie when she was 40 years younger. That explains the lack of close-ups, and the surreal experience of the older Bette Davis voice emanating from the younger Bette Davis's mouth. It was my own recorded special feature where I learned that the hand they chopped off was real... taken from the morgue! No wonder it looked so real. They'd get sued for that today.

I loved Agnes Moorehead's role. She was especially amazing considering she hated looking so bedraggled. I guess it was OK since she was so OVER-glamorized on Bewitched at the same time. It was almost horrible seeing Joseph Cotten play someone so awful. My favorite movie of all time is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Portrait-of-Jennie/dp/B0002KPHYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Portrait of Jennie</a>&nbsp;and he is just the greatest guy ever in that movie. He was also amazing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Letters-VHS/dp/0783215118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Letters [VHS</a>], where he was again paired with Jennifer Jones. (Actually, I think I have seen him play bad guys more often though.)

One of my favorite scenes was in the car, after Miriam slaps Charlotte. Miriam (Olivia De Havilland) just looks at Bette Davis and says, ""Now will you shut your mouth!"" Such a simple line, and yet so effective. The expression on her face, the growl in her voice, even her posture... a person could totally be terrified of her! And Charlotte looks appropriately terrified. I can't help thinking that today, with the lack of creativity and the way that no one cares, and the way a good number of movies are clones, the line would simply be ""Shut the f*** up!"" The writer has a small vocabulary and the actor doesn't really have to act. All that's necessary is a loud voice. The word itself is angry. How I wish more movies today were as original and well-acted! (Not that they aren't out there. They just seem rare.)

Overall, besides this movie being campy and a psychological thriller, I actually found it very sad. Charlotte was actually a very tragic character, and the fact that her whole life was wasted was not ever addressed, much. I could really empathize with her and almost felt guilty for enjoying the movie so much at her expense! I am just glad it was fiction!",1335571200,2,2889,5.103594080338266
372406,5,6301798562,"I'd advise getting this version of the HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE DVD rather than the one that was released in 2005 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hush-Hush-Sweet-Charlotte/dp/B0009NZ2MO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</a>) if you don't already own the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bette-Davis-Centenary-Celebration-Collection-All-About-Eve-Hush-Hush-Sweet-Charlotte-The-Virgin-Queen-Phone-Call-from-a-Stranger-The-Nanny/dp/B0012KSUTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bette Davis Centenary Celebration Collection (All About Eve / Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte / The Virgin Queen / Phone Call from a Stranger / The Nanny)</a>, which includes this version of the DVD.

The previous release didn't include the ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Joan: The Making Of..."" featurette.

Anyway, HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE  was supposed to be a re-teaming of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (with director Robert Aldrich) after their surprise horror hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Ever-Happened-to-Baby-Jane-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000EU1Q4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. In the movie, Bette and Joan play cousins and Crawford was supposed to be the one getting revenge in this flick. Of course, problems on the set came up and Crawford was replaced with Olivia De Havilland.

Bette portrays ""Charlotte,"" a southern belle who becomes a recluse after her married lover is found hacked to death at her party. Everyone believes she committed this horrendous crime and she becomes a pariah, living in the large plantation-mansion alone, with her only company being the ghosts of the past, nasty children who play pranks on her, and a broken-down maid named ""Velma Cruther"" (played to the hilt by Agnes Moorehead). As if living all alone for decades wasn't punishment enough, the city now wants Charlotte to vacate the property so that they can build a bridge through it. But she doesn't want to leave the only home she's ever known and therefore brings her cousin ""Miriam Deering"" (De Havilland) back, hoping that she can help her. And that's when the fun really starts. Suddenly, the past comes ripping back and takes poor Charlotte to the brink of madness!

Like its predecessor ""... Baby Jane,"" HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE  is a psychological thriller with great lines, top notch acting, and enough camp to make it such an endearing cult classic.

Davis is fantastic as ""Charlotte,"" and just hearing her do that southern accent is worth the price of admission alone! Another funny part is when a younger actress is playing the youthful Charlotte, but they use Bette's voice (how can they not); it has me in stitches. Also, there's a short scene with Bette and her married lover ""John Mayhew"" (played by the dashing Bruce Dern), and it's supposed to be taking place when the Charlotte character is just a teenager, but Bette insisted that she be in the scene and not the double! But the one scene that always has me rolling on the floor howling with laughter is when Bette crawls down the stairs, backwards, alternating between a primal scream and a maniacal laugh! You really think she lost her mind! Although the scene isn't funny on first viewing, it tickles me each time I've seen it afterwards.

And although De Havilland is good in her role as ""Miriam,"" I still can't help but imagine what the picture would've been like had Crawford stayed on. But in any event, the real scene stealer in this movie is Agnes Moorehead. She should've won the Academy Award for this role! I've only known her for her work as ""Endora"" on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bewitched-Season-One/dp/B0009B16TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bewitched: Season One</a>, and also seeing her in one episode of ""The Twilight Zone,"" but this characterization is totally different. Moorehead plays white-trash maid ""Velma Cruther"" and she manages to steal every scene, which is no easy task considering Davis is not only a fierce actress with remarkable screen presence but her portrayal of ""Charlotte"" was also a train wreck character that you couldn't look away from. You'll find no trace of ""Endora"" in ""Velma"" and when I first saw the movie, I wasn't sure that it was Moorehead!

So if you haven't seen HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE, and you liked ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"" and other horror/psychological thrillers, I would definitely recommend it.

Anyway, I highly recommend the HUSH...HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE DVD! If you're unsure which DVD is which, and the price drops to about the same, the one with the yellow cover with a closeup of Davis and De Havilland looking away from each other -- not the one where De Havilland is standing behind Davis -- is the most current release and has the above special features.",1325116800,16,6023,5.63646408839779
372407,5,6301798562,"What a movie! Talk about a movie that had the perfect storyline, plot build up, and climatic ending.  If you haven't seen it you are missing out on true storytelling and acting at it's finest.

Though I'm a Joan Crawford-head and would had loved to see her in this movie, Olivia de Havilland did a great job as Miriam Deering. She played her role to a T!  And who can forget Ms. Davis, never short of brilliant.  The only thing I didn't care for was Bette's attempt pulling off the southern accent, Agnes Moorehead won that prize(she also received a supporting Oscar nom too).

Hush...Hush was surely a picture ahead of it's time and great fun to watch.  I also would recommend if you happen to like this check out Strait-Jacket.  Now is Strait-Jacket anything close to this, no.  However if you like ax murder-mysteries and want to do a compare-contrast of these 1964 classics please do so!",1319414400,2,891,4.594936708860759

372413,5,6301798562,"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte is a classic and a very good one as well. The movie tells the story of Charlotte Hollis who's has been the talk of the town (and not in a good way) for decades due to the murder of her lover being hack to death with an axe. The murder happen in 1927( fast forward to 1964) where poor Charlotte is an isolated person and very protective of her estate which her father gave her. This film is great in all ways so I will leave it at that, you will love the performances Bette never disappoints as well as the supporting cast. The film has many genres like thriller, jealousy, love, and drama, its a who done it film, but fill with great detail. I have watch it twice to truly understand this film and the whole story (for me anyway) is a long enjoyable one. After seeing Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte I realize Hollywood lost its magic years ago with great movies like these are very hard to find nowadays.

372455,2,6301798562,"I laugh when I think of what I thought I might get out of `Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte'.  It looked so `dangerous' and so `chilling' and so; entertaining.  Sadly, the film falters on so many levels that it can't really be taken seriously despite the fact that it tries so hard to be taken seriously.

I think that is my biggest complaint when it comes to this film.  It should have embraced its flaws and fully embellished its own `silliness'.  Instead, `Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte' doesn't seem to get the fact that it is campy.  It tries so hard to be serious that it winds up becoming laughable, especially when you consider the fact that nearly everyone involved is so intent of `acting their parts' that they bring a new meaning to the word `theatrical'.  Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland are all over the place (they truly compliment one another, if you get my drift), but neither are as slapstick crazy as Agnes Moorehead, who gives one of the worst supporting performances I've ever seen!

Am I crazy for thinking that Joseph Cotten was really good here?

So, the film has this layer of darkness that overwhelms it from the very beginning, when young Charlotte's lover is hacked up with an ax.  I only wish that the film had known which way to go with itself.  I mean, that opening scene is just delicious and could have led way to some horrific and truly chilling sequences, but instead the film feels cheap in its delivery and thus never once musters enough fear in us to care `one way or another' what happens in the end.

And the villains are so plainly obvious that one really only has to be introduced to them to know that they are no good, which kills any and all suspense that this half-baked thriller is trying to cook up.

When this film tries to be scary it's almost comical.

And yet, I really, really liked Joseph Cotten in this!

Some really love this film, but I for one can't really say much good for it, aside from Cotten.  I found it to be sloppy and completely overly acted.  The director didn't understand how to extract true suspense here, and with the ridiculous Moorehead stinking up nearly every other scene, this film is truly a disaster.  What they should have done was embraced Moorehead's camp and turned this film into a spoof, intentionally serving us up laughter in place of terror.  This could have at least become another `What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?', a film that established a clear cult following because it seemed to understand and toy with its own camp value.

But alas; this is a film that honestly thinks it's better than it is.",1262649600,2,2585,4.566160520607375

Just the dialogue and snappy lines alone is worth watching this movie and having Bette, Olivia & Agnes deliver those lines is pure fun! Some of the lines that Bette says in the film: ""Where you are I could spit in your eye...with no strain at all"", ""What do you think I asked you here for...company?!"", and the best line of all (directed at Olivia deHavilland)- ""You're a vile, sorry little [...]!"" Wonderfully witty and campy dialogue that is a joy to watch and see. Agnes Moorehead has some great lines with her drawn out southern accent: ""You know she broke that dadburn teapot up there...tea running all down the walls! Shooooweeee! ""She nottin but a chil'"" and my favorite (also directed at Olivia deHavilland) ""Oh so your finally showin' the right side of you'face ain't ya...well I seen it all the time"".

372460,5,6301798562,"It was announced in December, 1963 that the two stars of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, would be reunited for ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte"". After the huge financial and critical success of ""Baby Jane"", studios were fawning all over themselves for a vehicle the would bring these two movie goddesses back together. Before ""Baby Jane"" no one wanted Davis and Crawford in their movies, as the film studios felt they did not appeal to the box office. Once Joan and Bette's careers were reignited again, Hollywood was knocking down their doors. ""Hush, Hush..."" was suppose to star the two, but because of ill health and Davis' harsh treatment of her on the set, Joan fell ill and was hospitalized. What a terrible loss the studio had, as well as us fans, as we never saw Joan as Miriam in the final film. It would have been so neat to see Joan, as Miriam, beating the crap out of Bette as Charlotte, as the complete opposite happened in ""Baby Jane"", where Bette's character was the antagonist and abuser.
 Olivia DeHavilland does, however, give a remarkable performance in this film as Miriam. Olivia detetested doing bitch roles, but both Bette and director Robert Aldrich persuaded her to do the film. What makes her character so evil is the subtext in which she uses in her portrayal: we, as the audience, at the beginning of the picture, believe that Miriam is such a kind-hearted, soft spoken woman who's best interest is her cousin Charlotte's welfare: we soon discover none of this is true as Olivia portrays one of the most evil, psychotic women ever on film.
 The rest of the cast is first rate, from Agnes Moorehead, who plays Charlotte's maid Velma, to Joseph Cotten, who plays an unscrupulous doctor, out to destroy Charlotte.
 ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte"" is the best film in the ""Baby Jane"" genre. There were many 1960's films that tried to duplicate the success of ""Baby Jane"", like ""Lady in a Cage"", Straight-Jacket"", and ""Dead Ringer"", but ""Hush, Hush"" comes a close second to being the sequel that it was suppose to be to the mother film.
 According to Bette Davis, she wasn't overly fond of the film, but fans of these hag-films, like me, love these vehicles: nothing like watching former movie queens, looking like hell, and tearing up the scenery!
 This film also received a whopping 7 Academy Award nominations, but winning none: at the time the film set a record for a horror film receiving the most Oscar nods. This record would be broken in 1991 by ""The Silence of the Lambs"".
 There is also another DVD release of ""Hush, Hush"" that is available, but if you already have the 2005 DVD release of the film I would suggest in passing on it. There is a neat documentary on the film, but it doesn't really offer anything that we ardent Bette and Joan fans don't already know. Contrary to public belief there are no Joan Crawford deleted scenes on the 2008 DVD release. Rumor has it 20th Century Fox destroyed the scenes that Joan did prior to leaving the film. In the second DVD there are still pictures of Joan in character as Miriam, but that is about it.",1239321600,7,3111,4.688644688644689

She stars as Charlotte Hollis,a woman who you ultimately end up feeling very sorry for even after you see how isolated and weird she is. In keeping with her nack with melodrama this story is complex and intricate. Charlotte,accused of the murder of her already married beau while she was a young woman had withdrawn into her own twisted world of broken memories until in 1964 when her coniving cousin (Olivia DeHaviland) shows up to take Charlotte to the looney bin so the city can bulldoze her old family house down. The twisted story that developed after that is just something you have to see to believe;the errie coolness of DeHaviland as she conspires to drive her cousin into pure delerium with...pretty much whatever it took up against the complete unhinged moodiness and harshness of the broken Charlotte. Of course in the end Charllote desintigrates into complete Blanche DeBouis style madness,even resulting in a very linear hallucination illustrating her own take on the old crime before,in the end......well your not certain whether to be relieved or not. At a time where movies generally had a distinctly sad or happy ending,usually the latter being preffered this one has that awkward,uncertain conclusion that is often used in more modern era when films seem to come to a conclusion rather then have a distinct emotional quality to the ending. This movie from beginning to end will tend to make the mind wonder rather then have...well more then a split second emotional reaction. And in many ways it's very much a harbinger of what was to come in cinema during the 60's and after;that genre of horror/mystery that is still the name of the game even to present day. The era of old ""talkie"" Hollywood was officially coming to an end and even at a more advanced age Bette Davis was as on the cutting edge of this new emmerging style of film making as she had in the one that it had replaced. Now THAT is true longjevity.",1236816000,,2818,5.909313725490196
372463,5,6301798562,"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte is a powerful film that proves Bette Davis was still at the peak of her form even in the mid 1960s. The acting is very convincing and the story line moves along very well. The cinematography and choreography shine in particular and I really like that the film was shot in black and white--it adds to the horror effects in this film. Yes, it is campy at times but overall it's not a picture that you'll forget anytime soon and it left me quite impressed with the cast and crew.

We first meet Charlotte Hollis, an aging spinster living alone in a deteriorating Southern mansion with her only real friend, her servant Velma Cruther (Agnes Moorehead). Hollis's father loathed the one man Charlotte ever really loved; it seems that this young man John Mayhew (Bruce Dern) was married at the time he wanted to elope with Charlotte! Charlotte has never forgotten John who gets killed by an unknown ax murderer the night she was to run away from him; and although people think Charlotte may have killed John herself there's no evidence so Charlotte never did any time in prison. Instead, Charlotte is essentially condemned to living her life alone in her home; and she also manages to delude herself into thinking that she may well have killed John herself.

Things change pretty fast when Charlotte is about to be evicted from her Southern home because the county needs to build a bridge. Her cousin (and only next of kin) Miriam Deering (Olivia de Havilland) shows up with a mutual acquaintance Dr. Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotten). Charlotte and her servant Velma don't quite see eye to eye with Drew and Miriam--they want Charlotte to peacefully leave the mansion while Charlotte and Velma want Charlotte to stay.

There's also a tug of war over money--it seems Velma wants some if Charlotte dies or becomes incapacitated while we slowly begin to suspect that others may want the same money. Could the others be Miriam and Drew? Could it be Jewel Mayhew, who could be seeking revenge against Charlotte if she thought that Charlotte did in fact kill her late husband John? Watch the movie and find out! The suspense at some moments is very high and even though the movie gets somewhat creepy at times the performances are remarkably strong and memorable.

The DVD comes with a good number of extras. We get a retrospective look back at director Robert Aldrich and the general production of the film; and we learn that this was supposed to be a type of ""sequel"" that re-paired Bette Davis with Joan Crawford after they co-starred in Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? There is an extra with Bruce Dern who remembers working with Bette; and there is another short film narrated by Joseph Cotten himself.

So imagine my surprise when, just a few minutes into the film, someone's hand gets rather graphically cut off! Not something I would've expected for 1965.

The movie centers around Charlotte Hollis (Bette Davis), who lives in an old mansion. It was the scene of a crime in 1927, the previously mentioned hand-chop, which ended up being a murder, and she was blamed for it. She was never charged but everyone ""knows"" she's guilty (especially since she was having an affair with the murder victim). She's spent her entire adult life living in the house with her servant (Agnes Morehead, and I gotta say, I had no idea it was her), and not really doing anything else, going very slightly crazy (though she's far more sane than she pretends to be, at least at the start).

Sadly her house is about to be knocked down to make room for an expressway. I guess that's better than having your planet demolished to make room for a hyperspace bypass, but still harsh. She's not too pleased about this and so enlists the aid of her cousin (Olivia de Havilland), and her doctor (Joseph Cotten) to save her house.

Not surprisingly, things don't go entirely as planned, and Charlotte starts to halucinate, thinking she's seeing or hearing her dead beau. Even more ominous things start to happen, like a butcher knife (the murder weapon), being found stuck into the floor next to a severed hand. Is Charlotte actualy going round the bend now, or is someone just trying to make her thnk she is?

This is certainly one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a while. The story is gripping, the direction is excellent and Bette Davis really kicks ass as Charlotte. She really keeps the audience wondering what's going on in her head. Olivia de Havilland and Joseph Cotten are also excellent.

372544,4,6301798562,"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (Robert Aldrich, 1964)

It's taken me almost a month to get around to writing a review of Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. It's certainly not that I didn't like the film, which is wonderful in so many respects. Maybe there's just nothing more to be said about it; so many critics have held it up as one of the premier examples of American filmmaking that who am I to add anything? So I'll probably just end up typing something generic and saying ""see this"".

The plot: long long ago in a galaxy far far away, a young woman was involved with a married man. Said married man was killed at a party; everyone assumed that said young woman had done it in a fit of jealous rage. Fast-forward some, and said young woman is now old, bitter, and friendless. (Married man is still dead.) Her name is Charlotte Hollis (Bette Davis). Her lover's widow, Jewel Mayhew (Mary Astor), is also still alive, and the bitterness between the two is still very much alive with them. The two have lived in the same town all their lives, hating one another, with the townsfolk sympatheitc towards Mayhew and Hollis left with only one friend, her housekeeper Velma (Agnes Moorehead, in what may have been her finest screen performance). Things might well have gone on the same way until the two bitter old hags died, but the government has stepped in-- they want to tear down the Hollis mansion to put in a highway. Charlotte is, for obvious reasons, adamantly opposed to this plan. When she runs a construction crew off by taking potshots at them, her doctor, Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotten), sends for Charlotte's long-estranged sister Miriam Deering (Olivia de Havilland), hoping that maybe the two of them together can get Charlotte to see reason. The house, however, may have its own say in things-- with Miriam's arrival, the rumors of the house's being haunted rev up into full gear again, with Miriam, Charlotte, and Bayliss all seeing and hearing weird things, and Velma all but set to flee screaming in terror. Or is some combination of these players trying to drive Charlotte insane, since the whole ""making her see reason"" thing just ain't workin'?

Charlotte was nominated for seven Oscars, though it won none, getting double-teamed by Mary Poppins and Zorba the Greek. All the nominations were well-deserved however; the movie's outstanding aspects are many and varied. It brought in nominations for editing, best original song, set decoration, cinematography, all the things that casual filmgoers casually notice and critics fall all over themselves praising; all the little details that can turn a mediocre movie into a brilliant one. Moorehead was the only person in front of the camera to get a nod, however, and that strikes me as odd; a very high-powered cast put together a fantastic bunch of performances here. Davis and de Havilland's exploration of the sisters' relationship is remarkable (and familiar territory for Aldrich, who'd taken Bette Davis down this same path two years earlier in the brilliant Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?), and Cotten's role in the relationship is fantastically played out. Astor's role is small, as are a number of others played by big-league actors in the movie (Victor Buono, Bruce Dern, George Kennedy, and a number of other folks you'll recognize all have small parts), but even in 1964, in her final film, already suffering from the heart condition that would ultimately kill her, she's still mesmerizing.

A fantastic movie, as good today as it was almost fifty years ago. Highly recommended. ****",1207008000,3,3604,4.9032786885245905

372546,4,6301798562,"This new DVD edition of HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE is being released to help celebrate the 100th birthday of Bette Davis.

Following the enormous success of ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"", producer-director Robert Aldrich quickly set about finding another lurid thriller for Bette Davis and Joan Crawford to do battle in. He found the ideal follow-up in HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE. But his grand reunion was not to be, as Joan Crawford cited illness and dropped out, and Olivia de Havilland replaced her.

Based on a story by Henry Farrell, CHARLOTTE centers around a reclusive Southern spinster called Charlotte Hollis (Bette Davis), who lives in a rambling old mansion in Hollisport with prickly maid Velma Crother (Agnes Moorehead). Still tortured over the mysterious slaying of her married lover, Charlotte has lived in seclusion for over 40 years when the mansion is to be torn down to make way for a road development. Charlotte arranges for her erstwhile cousin Miriam (Olivia de Havilland) to visit and help in stopping the impending demolition. But Miriam has other things in mind. Obviously having watched ""Gaslight"" far too many times, Miriam and family doctor Drew (Joseph Cotten) decide to exploit Charlotte's fragile grip on reality and scare her into a complete nervous breakdown, the goal being that Miriam will inherit the large family fortune.

Wildly-campy with some fabulous dialogue, HUSH...HUSH. SWEET CHARLOTTE is a more than worthy successor to ""Baby Jane"", but the film also has some genuine moments of pathos, characters that the audience truly take to heart and some inspired art direction and photography.

In a rare role reversal (normally she played the scare-monger rather than the victim) Bette Davis is amazing as Charlotte, heartbreaking, vulnerable and yet with a strength of mind and character.

In another rare departure, Olivia de Havilland plays the villainess with relish, enjoying the juicy dialogue and generally having a ball. Her glacial reserve and crisp beauty adds an interesting angle to her character's sinister motives.

His appalling Southern accent aside (although I've heard worse), Joseph Cotten's Drew was another memorable addition to his impressive gallery of baddies. Oscar-nominee Agnes Moorehead, as the acid-tongued Velma, is probably the greatest performance in the entire film. Mary Astor came out of retirement to play Jewel Mayhew, the widowed wife of Charlotte's murdered lover (film fans will remember that Davis and Astor also played duelling dames in the classic ""Great Lie""). A young Bruce Dern is impressive as the ill-fated sweetheart John Mayhew; as is Victor Buono (also from ""Baby Jane"") in his flashback role as Charlotte's imposing Daddy.

Frank DeVol's Oscar-nominated score perfectly sets the scene, with the eerie lullabye-like Title Song becoming an integral part of the plot. A true masterpiece of the genre, HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE is a must for every self-respecting film fanatic.",1203552000,5,2976,5.373390557939914

372583,4,6301798562,"I first saw HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE on television years ago when the local television stations still played a weekday afternoon movie interrupted by many commercials and ""dialing for dollars.""  I was probably in my early teens then and remember being fascinated by the morbid drama and the haunting theme song has always been stored somewhere in my memory.  I recently enjoyed re-watching the film and was happy to see it has held up as a gothic suspense film with some horror elements.

In a prelude we see handsome young Bruce Dern playing a married Lothario being told to break off his relationship with Charlotte by her father, played by Victor Bueno, who was actually still in his twenties when he filmed this role.  Bruce Dern's character is murdered in a gruesome manner by an unseen attacker and we see Charlotte emerge in the midst of a party her father is giving looking bewildered and covered in blood.

Flash forward thirty-seven years and Charlotte, now played by Bette Davis, is an eccentric older woman living in her decaying Louisiana mansion, left to her by her now deceased father, that is about the be destroyed for highway construction.  We learn Charlotte was the chief suspect in the long ago murder but her father was able to shield her from prosecution with his money and a hasty trip to Europe.  Charlotte is looked after by Velma, a loyal servant and quite a character played by an excellent Agnes Moorehead (Endora of Bewitched fame). An old friend and the family doctor, Drew (played by Joseph Cotton) also takes a protective interest in Charlotte and her money.  Charlotte's sweet voiced cousin Miriam (played perfectly by Olivia de Havilland) arrives to help the  increasingly deranged woman make the transition out of her lifelong home which is about to be destroyed.  Strange, spooky happenings begin to escalate and the viewer is left unsure of whether the supernatural, Charlotte's delusions or something more concrete are the cause. Meanwhile an insurance investigator from England who has always been fascinated by the case arrives while another major player in the mystery nears death and may be ready to reveal what she knows.  All is satisfactorily explained by the end but not after several twists and some deaths occur.

Bette Davis is fine as the tortured Charlotte since the role calls for her brand of unsubtle performance.  Olivia de Havilland (one of the four leads in GONE WITH THE WIND) is even better as the calm and competent Miriam who may have a secret or two of her own.  And Agnes Moorehead does perhaps the best acting in her role of Velma the servant who knows and sees all.

372587,4,6301798562,"The story behind the conception of ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" is well documented, so the question is: without being another Bette Davis/Joan Crawford battlefest, does it match up to the runaway success of ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane""? My opinion is that it ranks as a good movie, but falls into the shadow of it's predecessor.

The plot follows Davis as Charlotte, an eccentric recluse who has been shunned by the townsfolk ever since her married lover was found brutally murdered at a party when she was a young girl. Branded as the killer, Charlotte has grown into a bitter and lonely old woman, who is finally forced to come out of her isolation when the county wants to knock down her house to build a new road. The main part of the film begins as Charlotte's cousin Miriam arrives in an attempt to talk some sense into her, and all the skeletons of the past come to light again.

The film is built around it's two central stars, Bette Davis and Olivia de Haviland (who plays Miriam). The two could scarcely be more different. Davis plays Charlotte as wide-eyed, shrill and in a constant state of nervous terror, while de Havilland delivers a performance of sleek velvety calm. The film hinges on the relationship between these two women, and out of the two of them, it is Miriam rather then Charlotte who suggests a character with much more going on beneath the surface, thanks to de Havilland's glacial cool. Davis is brittle and exhausting nearly all the time, and although she was one of the greatest Hollywood stars of her time, some more subtelty would have greatly enhanced the character of Charlotte in places. However, for the most part she is terrific, in fact her performance gets better and better as the film progresses, culminating in a very moving conclusion. De Havilland also does a great job, speaking in silky soft tones for the most part, but capable of erupting into surprisingly venomous anger as more of her true character comes to light. As is usual with a well known film like this, the twists and surprise revelations are already well known, but what impressed me was the the way the various strands were worked into the film, and how effectively some of the twists were then later built up into new twists! It must have been very effective for first time audiences in 1964, and for anyone who has not seen it even today.

The film looks great. Beautifully shot in black and white, it makes great use of selective lighting and deep shadows, more often than not inside the grand but rotting mansion that Charlotte lives in. There are also some great lines in the script, most often spoken by Davis, which make the proceedings border on high camp some of the time, but for the most part it is a quality product. What detracts from the enjoyment are some very lazy post dubbing in several places (where you can see that the actors are either mouthing something different or not speaking at all!), and the opening prologue set at a party supposedly in 1927, which has no attempt at period detail at all as most of the party goers are dressed in contemporary 1960's oufits (one girl even has a beehive hairdo!). This lack of care by director Robert Aldrich is more in line with one of William Castle's schlocky (but enthusiastic) efforts, rather than a major studio production like ""Charlotte"" was supposed to be.

I haven't really got that many bones to pick though, as the film delivers solid entertainment for most of it's 2hour running time. It IS a little long, but the constantly unravelling plot together with the performances from it's stars (not forgetting to mention the hilarious turn by Agnes Moorhead as the tousled maid) keep you hooked all the way through. Although some of the early parts are a bit of a screech-fest, it definitely improves as reaches the end, in fact Davis' performance in the last half hour becomes quite touching (barring her cross-eyed freak out on the stairs), and the ending scene especially shows that the film has a real heart.",1171238400,3,3998,4.6908831908831905

Otherwise, this film is a wonderful, nostalgic presentation
of the B-movie style, black and white thrillers of the
late 50's/early 60's.  Bette Davis, fresh off her success
of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" returns in a film
adaption of another Henry Farrell story.  She reprises the role
of a mentally disturbed dame (in this case, done Southern style)
and she takes it way over the top, but still within the threshold
of high cinema.  Fellow Academy Award winner, Olivia de Havilland
(replacing Joan Crawford, who was originally slated for ""Miriam"")
gives a good performance as the goodhearted relative with dark
ulterior motives.

This is a great movie. The theatrical trailers are laughable at how they present this film as the most suspenseful, horrifying film ever.
Well,given the time period, who knows? In any case, this is an enjoyable
exercise in suspense with Bette Davis at the helm, which always
translates into worthwhile cinema.  Along with Davis and De Haviland, Agnes Moorhead
gives a remarkably delightful
performance as the feisty housekeeper,
receiving a well-deserved Academy Award nomination.

372644,5,6301798562,"While this movie works well as a murder mystery, it is much more than that.  It deals quite masterfully with the notions of what madness is and how tenuous the notions of reality actually are.  There is also that whole Peyton Place sense of the steamy hidden reality behind the surface faade of propriety.

Charlotte Hollis (one of Bette Davis' great mature performances) is a mad woman who is trapped in the past.  She is the prisoner of a murder she is accused of committing but is unable to prove herself innocent.  She lives in her late father's fading plantation estate and does nothing with the fortune left her.  The hatred of those who believe her guilty has kept her in the house, alone, and delusional.  Her one companion has been her housekeeper, Velma Cruther (played to award winning perfection by Agnes Moorehead).  The question is whether Velma is Charlotte's friend, warden, or worse.

Her cousin, Miriam Deering (finely played by Olivia de Havilland) comes to care for her and deal with her delusions.  Soon, distrust and suspicion arise between Miriam and Velma.  Enter Dr. Drew Bayliss (superbly played by Joseph Cotten), whom Miriam brings in the help treat Charlotte.  He seems a bit, well, you will see.

The movie is full of wonderful characters, especially Mary Astor as the widow of the womanizer Charlotte is supposed to have murdered.  John Mayhew is played by a young Bruce Dern and Mary Astor plays the older and dying Jewel Mayhew.  We also enjoy Harry Willis (played by the unique Cecil Kellaway) as the man captivated by Charlotte's story and helps bring certain parts of the story together through his investigation.  There is much more to enjoy in this film.  The black and white photography is perfect for the light and shadow required by this film.  I will leave you to enjoy the way the movie shifts the focus on madness and unreality.

This movie was a sensation and received many nominations for Academy Awards (and received the most Oscar(tm) nominations for a horror film until ""The Exorcist"" came along).  The original cast included Joan Crawford as well as Betty Davis, but Davis had a grudge against Crawford and harassed her until she became ill.  Olivia de Havilland replaced Crawford, but it is said that the opening shot of the back of Miriam's head looking at the estate is Crawford rather than de Havilland.

While not particularly horrifying by today's standards, it is still a very good film and is very much worth seeing for the performances as well as the story.",1157068800,2,2516,4.8023255813953485

The plot is completely original, and the acting is some of the best I have ever seen. I have never seen Joseph Cotten act so evil! I really wish Bette Davis would have done more movies like this. If you've already seen this movie, i recommend ""The Nanny"" (I think that's what it's called) and ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane."" In my opinion, neither of these surpasses this.

Sure, it's way over the top but actresses such as Bette Davis, Olivia DeHavilland and Agnes Moorehead have the talent and panache to pull it off.  With wonderful support from Joseph Cotten, Mary Astor, Victor Buono and Cecil Kellaway, the story unfolds nicely with Davis simply superb in her role as the demented Charlotte, a Southern Belle accused of murdering her married lover in 1927, but who feels she's protecting someone else.  Olivia is smooth in a role she usually doesn't play and Moorehead richly deserved her Supporting Actress nomination as the dowdy housekeeper.  The plot's pretty predictable but it's so lovingly crafted, it works.  Actresses like these don't come along every day but be glad we were blessed with this trio!",1151884800,2,922,5.079470198675497

372648,5,6301798562,"Surprisingly this film is over 40 years old, and still captures one's imagination and attention. As a child, i was too young to see the film in the theaters, tho i do remember the film making it's TV debut, as it was a big deal for some reason back then.

Seeing it on a black and white tv set dampered things a bit, as i thought that because of the grand scale the production seemed to possess that it was filmed in color. I was taken aback when i found out it was filmed in black and white. I only remembered at the time the dark scenes around the house, Bette Davis slowly deteriorating, and the 'mirror' scene near the end of the film  with Davis confronting her dead 'ex lover'. Well, kinda. Won't give the ending away. Otherwise, it was scary all in all to me.

It took years of waiting and seeing the film on different TV stations to finally get a video version of the film, which was uncut. TV at the time had a strange practice of editing down films to conform to their airtime, and also the violence to not offend the easily offended, tho sometimes makes a film incomprehensible.

The violence in the film is minimal, tho the first murder is and was a shocking set-piece that sets the whole tone of the film. Unlike Joan Crawford's 'Straight-Jacket', a film that Crawford opted for after leaving Charlotte and replaced quickly by DeHavilland where ax murders continue, the initial horror is not repeated in Charlotte, but you never know, right? That's how a good horror film is made. It's not exactly what you see, it's what you think you may see.

For it's time, the film boasted a boatfull of seasoned actors, and did a very good job with the material. The cinematography isn't as smooth as one would like, but given the time-span between murders and eerie moments a viewer needs to be on one's toes.

It's a shame that the film wasn't photographed in color, but, according to Davis herself, the film would have looked like 'Gone With The Wind' if it was. DeHavilland was a superb replacement for Crawford, as her rather laid-back approach to acting played against type. She's no Melanie here, and gave another powerful performance. As for Joseph Cotten, for some reason i never did like his style of acting. Aside from his classic performance in Citizen Kane, Cotten seemed rather bored in his acting chores, and never grabbed my attention in anything else he did, including this film.

Agnes Moorehead's performance was again, against type, as she by then was famous for her portrait of the over-bearing mother-in-law in 'Bewitched'. Here, she plays a dedicated servant, who is both outspoken, and knows from the early frames that something shady is going on.

It took quite a few viewings to figure out who the actual killer was. Either i was stupid child, or because it was not actually 'said' who the killer was in a way where it seemed important at the time when Davis's character is being transported away from her home is lost.  After a few viewings it did sink in that it was Cecil Kellaway's character who did fill in the empty blanks and let us realize what was going on.

Most claim that the film's running time is rather long. One must think of the scope of the material involved, and you'll understand why it took some time to not only get to know each character, but slowly know thier intent, and importance in Charlotte's life.

The expanded DVD version persented here is a curiousity. It has a few TV and film trailers, which are superb to look at.  The quality of the film is again, superb.

I was just wondering if there was any footage of Crawford on the set, or any footage shot of her in character. Would have been nice to see what she would have looked like if she actually did the film, but, much too late now.

So, Charlotte is a classic melodrama with some horror thrown in for good measure. It's still not a film for the little kiddies, as some images may be a little disturbing, and in some areas they may become bored and fall asleep. For us adults, it's an example of good filmmaking, utilizing some of our most beloved actors.",1147305600,6,4069,4.518367346938776

Cotten's accent does come and go, Davis' accent is consistent and perfect as is Agnes Moorhead's (and the movie is worth the price just to see her performance!), the gory part (and yes there is one, about 10 minutes into the movie) is not bloody, is (thank god) patently fake and except for what it represents (a man getting his hand and head cut off) is not disturbing, although I was surprised to see it in a movie with all these familiar faces and big names.  (And just about every speaking part in it was a face I recognized, though I couldn't name any.)  I avoid horror and was dreading but not really expecting it.  And the film was predictable.  I guessed every secret and surprise in it.  It was nevertheless beautifully and perfectly written and directed, it all just kind of unraveled with exposition given in left-handed and subtle ways as the film went along.  The only shock to me was the final death in the movie.  Perfect.  I liked it (the movie, not the final death, well, I liked that too considering...).",1137974400,2,1321,4.512605042016807

Is it the voice of her dearly departed lover, John Mayhew? (played nicely by Bruce Dern). Returned from the other world softly calling for his dear Charlotte.  The harpsichord playing the soft and gentle song that he wrote for her, as he sings ...hush,...hush sweet Charlotte.  Was it Charlotte's father that murdered her beloved with an axe as he sat waiting for Charlotte in the summerhouse?  Or was it John's jealous wife, Jewel Mayhew (Mary Astor's final role, brilliantly done) that wielded the fatal blows?  Or perhaps it was Charlotte's own dear cousin Miriam (memorable performance by Olivia deHavilland) that hacked poor John to pieces?  Or could Dr. Drew (Joseph Cotton, seething with southern charm) have done such a terrible thing?  A southern gothic tale filled with chills and haunting atmosphere sweeps the viewer into a cobweb of mystery and suspense.  This is a classic cast of stellar performers who knew how to bring their audience into a story and keep them entertained until the very end.  ""Hush....Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" is filled with haunting atmosphere, suspense, and in one memorable scene, pure terror. Bette Davis gives her all, and then some, as the forever grieving Charlotte Hollis.  A southern heiress wrongfully accused of her lover's murder.  Agnes Moorehead goes over the top as kooky and eccentric housekeeper, Velma Crothers- her performance alone is worth the price of admission.  This film is among my personal favorite gothic ghost story movies.  I highly recommend this movie for fans of, ""The Haunting"" (1963), ""The Innocents"" (1961) and ""Paranoiac"" (1963).

She has to fight to keep her beautiful louisiana mansion as well as her sanity when her cousin played by Olivia de Havilland comes to visit her.

The movie is famous for the histrionics of the main characters, especially Davis who is wild-eyed and screaming through most of the picture (using a totally fake Southern accent to boot). De Havilland is at the opposite end of the spectrum: smooth-talking and quiet-toned. Sometimes both actresses come across as mere types rather than real people. Agnes Moorhead plays the maid who crows the right conclusions first, and is the best of the lot here - she's very convincing.

372684,4,6301798562,"""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" is the perfect companion to the movie ""Whatever happened to baby Jane"" - both were directed by Robert Aldrich and have a gothic type, eery atmosphere to them.  Both films star Bette Davis. Aldrich wanted Joan Crawford to team up again with Davis for ""Hush, Hush"" after their huge success together in ""Baby Jane"".  Crawford agreed, but after 3 weeks into production, she walked off the set of ""Hush Hush"" claiming she could not work with Davis again.  Their long lasting fued had been in place in Hollywood for many years. Davis was thrilled with Crawford's exit, as it meant that her great friend Olivia De Havilland could take over the role.  Just some interesting trivia there for those who may not have known.

""Hush, Hush"" is about a spinster, Charlotte (Bette Davis), who lives in huge mansion in the South with her loyal housekeeper (Agnes Moorehead). The Council are planning to bull-doze down the house to make way for a new highway, but Davis will not budge from the home.  Charlotte's cousin, Miriam (Olivia De Havilland), is invited up by Charlotte to help resolve the matter.  However Miriam has other ideas. She plans to send Charlotte to a looney asylum so she can get all of her inheritance.  Charlotte has her own games in mind.

I didn't expect to find this title on DVD in Australia, but it was released last month (Nov 2005).  While generally I prefer ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane"", you cannot go passed adding this to your collection. Also, Davis' role is similar to that of ""baby Jane"" (eg, crazy old lady), so that is reason enough to see it - she plays it so well!  De Havilland is great as the cousin, and credit also goes to Agnes Moorehead who has some shining moments in this film.

The Australian DVD is in its original B&W, with widescreen anamorphic. The print has been beautifully restored.  The only special feature is the theatrical trailer.

372689,4,6301798562,"""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" explores many of the same themes as its better-known predecessor ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? "", in that it's a tale of isolation, dementia and familial manipulation. Also, it shares a lot of the same creative team behind that monumentally good thriller - Bette Davis and Victor Buono as Charlotte and her Daddy, and Robert Aldrich takes the directorial helm once more. I was therefore expecting it to be good, maybe not as tight or together as Baby Jane, but decent nonetheless. I wasn't prepared at all for how good it actually is.

Charlotte Hollis (Davis) has been shut away in her crumbling old mansion for the last 20 years, the victim of society rumours and the unproven murder of her married lover. She's been harassed by both children and adults alike, and hasn't but two friends in the world - her Doctor Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotten) and her crotchety maid Velma Cruther (Agnes Moorehead). When she refuses point blank to acknowledge that her home must be torn down by the state of Louisiana to make way for roads and bridges, she writes to her career-girl cousin Miriam (Oilvia DeHavilland), asking for help in saving the home where they both grew up. Miriam arrives and suddenly, the body count starts to rise as Charlotte starts to get a whole lot crazier.

The first and most startling aspect of this movie is just how unlike Baby Jane it is. So forget Baby Jane as a template - sure, Davis may wander about in white lace party dresses far too young for her character, but that's really about it. It's much, much slower to start, too, but all the more rewarding for it. Aldrich's direction is masterful, his claustrophobic and languid camerawork provides the perfect backdrop for the gothic tone and story, and his script is far more well-rounded and fleshed-out than that of Baby Jane.

Performances average out as excellent, and the standout players come in the shape of DeHavilland as cousin Miriam, and Moorehead as the drudge Velma. DeHavilland's perfect for the role, being utterly ladylike and charming, but possessed of a calm restraint that make her more pivotal scenes literally jump from the screen. Moorehead is possibly one of the most 'real' performances I've seen in a black and white movie from any age. She's believable and unglamorous and completely enthralling to watch. Davis breathes a pitiable and magnetic sort of life into the character of Charlotte, she's excellent as usual, but one can't help but feel that in the mire of excellent performances given by her supporting cast, that she does not stand out too much as simply Bette Davis in a Bette Davis picture.

The one element missing from the cast is the Human character, the one we can truly relate to. Joan Crawford's Blanche Hudson was the perfect counterpoint to Davis' screechy Baby Jane, and here, although DeHavilland's cousin Miriam is the 'normal' one, she still lacks the vulnerability and frailty we need to truly feel an attachment. Mary Astor as wronged wife Jewel Mayhew is, perhaps, the closest comparison, but her part is not big enough. Still, this is a small quibble that doesn't detract from the movie's effectiveness in the least.

Special effects, it also must be said, are really very good for a movie of this period!

The twists and turns in the plot are truly surprising, and the climactic scenes are absolutely spectacular, thanks to DeHavilland's consummate skill in her role and Aldrich's superlative direction. This is a slower, heavier, far more atmospheric ride than the excellent Baby Jane, and well-worth your cash.

372739,5,6301798562,"""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" was, as most people know, intended as a follow up (not a sequel) to the first and most influential ""horror hag"" film of them all, ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"". Producer/director Robert Aldrich who had helmed ""Jane"" wanted to repeat that film's box office success. He re-teamed Bette Davis (as Charlotte) and Joan Crawford (as her cousin Miriam) but, in events that have become the stuff of Hollywood Legend, Crawford dropped out, and was replaced by Bette's long-standing friend, Olivia de Havilland, fresh from ""Lady in a Cage"" (1964).

Although many find the plot somewhat convoluted, it is basically rather simple. Aging southern belle Charlotte Hollis lives in decayed splendor in the Louisiana mansion where, thirty seven years earlier, a horrible murder took place. The victim was none other than her married lover John Mayhew(Bruce Dern, in an early screen appearance) whom Charlotte fears was killed by her overbearing father (Victor Buono) who was against their affair. Over the years, however, the local townspeople have concluded that Charlotte herself was responsible, but escaped punishment due to her father's political connections. As it happens, the highway commission is planning on building a bridge where Charlotte's house stands, and are tirelessly trying to remove her from the property. She is just as doggedly determined to remain, because she fears demolition of the house will reveal proof of her father's guilt. Charlotte's only companions are her old, white trash housekeeper, Velma Crother (Agnes Moorehead) and the family doctor, Drew Bayliss (Joseph Cotten). Charlotte's attempts to hold off the sheriff are finally beginning to weaken, so, in a last attempt to hold onto the old plantation, she sends for her Cousin Miriam Deering, hoping she can help. Miriam does, eventually arrive, but it's soon obvious that she is there for reasons other than to comfort and aid her cousin.

The film is well photographed in eminently suitable black and white, and the haunting musical score by an Oscar-nominated Frank DeVol (as well as the beautiful nominated title song) aid it immeasurably. The performances are what makes the movie so much fun. Bette Davis, as usual, goes all out as the tormented cousin, moaning, whining simpering and,especially shrieking her way through her part. In contrast, the still very attractive de Havilland is, at first, a model of restraint. Matching Davis in the histrionics department is Moorehead (who was also Oscar-nominated for her performance) as she carries on, sometimes so hilariously, it's difficult to understand what she is saying. (Oh well, that's what DVD subtitles are for!) At the same time, she can be moving as well. Cotten gets to do his own (relatively restrained) scenery-chewing , but the scenes in which Davis, de Havilland and Moorehead scream at each other in very thick southern accents could be right out of the old ""Mama's Family"" TV series. As Jewel Mayhew, widow of Bette's lover, Mary Astor gives her usual excellent performance, so subdued and realistic, that she seems to be in a different film. Ditto Cecil Kellaway as a curious insurance investigator. In the end, though, it's all the overplaying and gaudy scene stealing which makes ""Charlotte"" so much fun. A remake would be not only redundant, but a mistake. ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" is truly one of a kind.

Her Velma Crother is fantastic, loyal, unflinching and hysterically funny!  The scenes between her Joseph Cotten and deHavilland are a riot!!  Davis is hammy and performs over-the-top but she said that is what the audience expected of her.  If she had toned it down a little, perhaps she would have gotten another Oscar nomination.  Still, Charlotte. with its dark, gothic mood and that beautiful unforgettable theme song still packs a great wallop today.  As other reviewers have mentioned there is a commentary along in the DVD and two theatrical trailers, plus three television ad spots.  The audio and video are beautifully remastered.  There are subtitles as well.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable Bette Davis film and the ending shots are as memorable as the beginning shots.  A fine follow-up to ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"".

Most memorable lines:

Charlotte:  What...do you think...I asked you..her for...COMPANY????

Charlotte:  (To Miriam)  You're a vile sorry little @#!*&!!!

Velma:  (To Miriam)  What's goin' on up there that you don't want me to know 'bout?

Velma:  (To Drew (Joseph Cotten)  I reckon you'll be sniffin' around here more than usual now that Miss Miriam's back!

Charlotte:  Damn you!  Damn You!  Get off my property or I'll shoot!!!!

Miriam:  (To Charlotte)  It's a cheap and disgusting magazine and only cheap and disgusting people will read it!

Miriam:  (To Charlotte)  Now will you shut your mouth!!!!

Miriam:  (To CHarlotte)  ....only because you were having a tawdry little affair with a married man!!!!

Charlotte:  I must be a terrible person....to ...have killed Drew!!!",1123977600,8,2510,5.15211970074813

It was a delight to finally have this movie on DVD--nice job but low on special features (if that is important to you).  The commentary, though interesting, was more focused on trivia and actor bios while I would have prefered some technical talk (making of) and actor commentary from the surviving cast and crew of this 41 year old movie.  Beautifully photographed in gorgeous black & white, this is a truly gothic movie.  It is wonderful to watch these shadowy yet carefully lit dark scenes--and still be able to see everything that we are supposed to see.  It's a long movie, but very involving and satisfying.  I already knew that Davis would be great, but what really wowwed me was DeHavaland's performance.  Moorehead is a hoot.  The costumes and hair styles were not accurate in the 1927 prologue but this is a trivial point. The wider screen is an improvement on the full screen VHS versions, allowing us to see the true composition of the shots.

372746,4,6301798562,"The classically gothic atmosphere emerges in the opening of Robert Aldrich's film Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) through a number of shots of a plantation mansion in a desolate and mysterious location somewhere in the South.  Clever editing of several angles of the old mansion accentuates the grandeur of the place while also bringing forth an ominous tone.  Simultaneous to the imagery the audience can hear an angry voice that at first is hard to distinguish, but as the camera moves closer to the manor it becomes easier to understand.  It is a simple, yet ingenious approach to set up the suspenseful elements of the story, which does not waste anytime in this fifteen minute long prologue.

Two years prior Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte Aldrich directed What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?  A dark claustrophobic tale of family dysfunction where Aldrich paired up Bette Davis with Joan Crawford, which gave him a second chance to reunite the brilliant actors in another creepy film.  However, it was a short-lived delight for Aldrich who stood without Crawford at the beginning of the production, as she had to withdraw from her part due to medical reasons.  Consequently, Aldrich substituted Crawford with Olivia de Havilland, whose talent emerges in the role as Charlotte's cousin Miriam Deering.

The previously mentioned gothic atmosphere rests heavily on the lengthy prologue where the audience is introduced to a love triangle that has been uncovered by Big Sam (Victor Buono).  Big Sam is the father of Charlotte who has fallen in love with the married man, John Mayhew (Bruce Dern), who has the intentions of eloping with Charlotte.  Unfortunately Big Sam has found out about John's affair with his daughter, and he intends to stop John at any costs.  Big Sam demands that John break up the affair, as he does not want John to get his hands on his fortune through his daughter.  Eventually, when John breaks off the relationship he seriously upsets the woman who in jealous rage slashes him up with a cleaver.  John's body is later found decapitated and without a right hand, as his head and hand are nowhere to be found in this macabre opening.

Several decades after the murder of John, more precisely 1964, Charlotte (Bette Davis) still lives in the old mansion.  Years of mismanagement of the old mansion have left the manor in a shabby condition, which augments the gothic atmosphere.  To further develop the mystifying tone in the film kids have created nursery rhymes similar to one for the legendary murderer Lizzie Borden, which goes:

""Lizzie Borden took an axe

And gave her mother forty whacks.

And when she saw what she had done

She gave her father forty-one.""

The reason why kids, on occasion, wander close to the worn-down mansion is to test their courage, as it is believed that the crazy woman Charlotte still haunts the house.  It is publicly known that she also murdered her lover John.  Also, to increase the fear of those who dare to enter the mansion the children chant:

""Chop, chop, sweet Charlotte,

Chop, chop till he's dead.

Chop, chop, sweet Charlotte,

Chop off his hand and head.""

The first 30 minutes sets up a rather intriguing and complex story, as the audience also learns that Charlotte was never brought to trial due to lack of evidence.  The acquittal is something many suggest has to do with Big Sam's influential friends in New Orleans.  This notion also brings out the thought of vengeful ghosts, as strange occurrences happen in the old manor.  Further complexity surfaces in the story when it is revealed that the state of Louisiana has decided to build a highway and a bridge where the mansion is located.  Through this effort by the state the audience gets an opportunity to study Charlotte's eccentric and mad behavior.  The plot around Charlotte thickens when her cousin Miriam Deering arrives, as she also bear witness to the strange occurrences on the manor.

Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte presents an intriguing story with depth in the plot and a frightful atmosphere.  However, there are scenes that seem to intentionally use cinematic elements from other films from the preceding decade.  It is evident that there is a strong presence of Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho (1960) in the beginning of the film in both the detailed mise-en-scene and the murder.  Henri-Georges Clouzot's brilliant Les Diabolique (1955) also makes an obvious appearance through one of the many twists.  The cinematic application of other films hurts the film's uniqueness and integrity.  Nonetheless, the film succeeds through the terrific performance of both Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland to portraying a Southern gothic horror film, which leaves the audience wondering despite the anticlimactic ending.",1123459200,,4759,5.021683673469388
372747,4,6301798562,"""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" is as much a gothic horror story as any told by any true Southerner. While not a direct ""sequel"" to ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?,"" HHSC is a true follow-up to the former film. HHSC is absolutely dripping with mood and intensity. You can almost feel the oppressive heat and humidity and smell the crisp night air and the mildewed scent of decaying Spanish moss and rot.

Robert Aldrich should have continued creating films such as these for as long as he could, because he definitely had two hits with WEHBJ and HHSC. He wisely used very tight and unique scripts for both projects, but I have to be honest, I quite prefer ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" to Baby Jane. Part of that is the pervasive mood of Charlotte and part of it is the cast, and the characters that exist in HHSC. Maybe Aldrich managed such a stellar cast for his second outing with Davis because of the sleeper hit status Baby Jane achieved (in fact, it drew Oscar nods for both Davis and Crawford and reinvigorated the careers of both). Regardless, when you have: Bette Davis, Olivia de Haviland (who Davis insisted replace Joan Crawford), Agnes Moorehead, Joseph Cotten, Victor Buono, Mary Astor, and Bruce Dern it is impossible to not have the cast light up the screen.

While a cast such as this was sure to create a box office, ""...Charlotte"" wouldn't have had the legs it's had all these years if there weren't a good story to go with them - and it certainly has that.

Charlotte Hollis (Davis) is an old spinster who's never been the same since her beau John Mayhew (Dern), who Daddy (Buono) despised was murdered. The townspeople have always believed Charlotte murdered ol' John and though she was never charged with the crime, public opinion long ago convicted her. Living in seclusion in her now decrepit and hauntingly eerie plantation home, Charlotte is desperate for assistance - the once grand southern mansion is scheduled for demolition in order to put in a new highway. Charlotte calls Cousin Miriam (de Havilland) to come down and fix it so that nothing happens to the house. Miriam comes....but she has other plans on her mind - she is going to help Charlotte pack up and get out of the house. She wants to get Charlotte's money...and there's lots of it. Along with her boyfriend, Dr. Bayliss (Cotten), they lay out a plan to have Charlotte committed, as once done, Miriam will be the only Hollis heir left to receive the family fortune.

Weak and fraile, Charlotte would be an easy mark if it were not for her maid Velma (outrageously and stellarly played by Moorehead) and a reporter by the name of Harry Willis (Cecil Kellaway), who seems to have sympathy for the old girl. Regardless, Miriam and Dr. Bayliss are quite determined. How it plays out is what makes this film a tour de force and a nail biting thriller.

As I said, the performances in this film are some of the finest you will ever encounter and it may be because these venerable actors were enjoying the freedom of an independent filmmaker AND because they were all potentially creating a ""comeback"". However, I don't believe these actors were that selfish in their craft - no, their performances are the creation of a love of their work and the joy they had working with others who were all tops in their field.

With more quotable lines than I can begin to enumerate, HHSC is a film that you must become immersed in. Let the wave of stagnant air and rotting timbers overtake you and you will become a captive of this fine, fine film.",1121644800,14,3518,4.6208
372788,5,6301798562,"Whew!!!  Here's a great film that took ages to finaly make it to the DVD format.  Hey Fox, what took you guys so long?!  Oh well, it doesn't matter.  At least it's finally here.

This is the film that single-handedly transformed my perception of what an ""old"" film could be.  I remember when I was thirteen years old (1996) and I caught this one on AMC on a stormy evening.  By the fantastic staircase confrontation scene between Velma (Agnes Moorehead) and the sinister Cousin Miriam (Olivia DeHavilland, the movie had absolutely grabbed me by the eyeballs and wouldn't let go.  I was captivated.  I've had a lifelong love affair with older suspense films such as this one ever since, and this particular masterpiece is still my all-time favorite film.

372791,5,6301798562,"Ever since I was a kid I identified this as ""the scariest movie I've ever seen"". And even today, despite the fact that as an adult one no longer possesses the same ability to be frightened by a film, ""Charlotte"" still emerges as one of the of the purest of terror-films in that it hits so many of the back-of-the-dark-closet horror cliches dead-center (in a good way) as few ever quite have.

Oh, sure, it won't compare to later slasher pics for blood (only one person gets sliced & diced, in fact) but the term ""southern gothic"", to my mind, simply held no real meaning until THIS came out...

Many people don't realize that ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" received more Oscar nominations [7] than any other horror film up to that time, a record tied only by ""Silence of the Lambs"" (in 1991) and surpassed by ""The Exorcist""s 10 nominations (in 1973)... ""Charlotte"" won none, but the fact it lost the Best B&W Cinematography Oscar (for Joseph Biroc's drippingly dark work) is akin to grave-robbery!

Grander and more haunting than ""Baby Jane"" (though from the same production team), ""Charlotte"" is the more seductively macabre movie.

Borne of an era when ""real"" thrillers were coming to a close, when ""Psycho""-period shockers felt so supernatural and creepy (even when they may not have been, technically, supernatural in plot) at the Cold War peak of the early-'60s...

Somehow, it all just feels more forlorn and sacred and sad than sadistic.

It's also one of the most quotable of films --- the dinner scene is a classic in itself. And, if you watch closely, it's chock full of smatterings of various scenes from Bette Davis pictures re-executed.

2005 DVD: the extras aren't great, folks. The commentary is by rote, and they didn't include the 'AMC Backstory' episode so many of us were hoping for. Also, THIS IS NOT total wide-screen, as the film was originally shot in 1:1.85, and the DVD is 1:1.66, so we're still missing some of the sides of the movie!

2008 DVD Update: the new DVD release at least has a HUSH...HUSH, SWEET JOAN mini-doc about Crawford's original participation in the film before ducking out--- regrettably, none of her scenes are apparently available; also, the copy is full and proper 1x1.85 dimensions, unlike the 2005 DVD.",1116115200,28,2252,4.8311688311688314

In Baby Jane she is deliciously evil. If you like this you must see the other. This movie is psychologically scary and not bad in the physical scary department either.

Olivia de Havilland does a wonderful job of playing a manipulative and overbearing cousin. A far cry from her role in ""Gone with the Wind"". Agnes Moorehead as a poor self-sacrificing servant is amazing. I always liked her work, but she should have got an academy award for her portrayal here. For that matter all three actresses should have gotten awards. Ask fans of classic movies and they will tell you this is up there near the top. Fans of Bette Davis or Olivia de Havilland should definitely snap this up when it comes out on DVD. I refuse to pay this price for a VHS.

372844,4,6301798562,"""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" is one of the scariest murder mystery movies ever filmed, as well as one of the classiest. Bette Davis pulls out all the stops as Charlotte Hollis, a recluse in her decaying Louisiana mansion since being accused of the gruesome 1927 murder of John Mayhew, her married lover. When her house is threatened with demolition to make way for a highway thirty-seven years later, she enlists the help of her cousin Miriam Deering (superbly played by Olivia DeHavilland). Upon Miriam's arrival, strange and eerie things start happening. It soon becomes apparent that the Mayhew murder has not been completely forgotten.

 A final suggestion: Watch for the scene over dinner where Charlotte and Miriam verbally spar back and forth, dredging out the family skeletons and dirty laundry while a third guest, Dr. Drew (Jospeh Cotten), looks like a spectator at a tennis match.

372845,4,6301798562,"By 1960 both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were finding screen roles hard to come by--and they jumped at the chance to co-star in Robert Aldrich's shocker WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE.  When the film proved a huge critical and box office success the Aldrich-Davis-Crawford team wasted little time in rushing into HUSH... HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE.  But the Davis-Crawford feud wasn't a myth: the two loathed each other, and this time Crawford felt she was getting the short end of the script; after a few days of shooting Crawford left the set, and Olivia de Havilland was coaxed out of semi-retirement to replace her.
The story is actually fairly predictable, borrowing a great deal from every thing from Hitchcock's SPELLBOUND to the French DIABOLIQUE and quite a bit from BABY JANE as well.  In the 1920s, Southern belle Charlotte Hollis has a torrid affair with a married man--an affair that ends when her lover is hacked to bits with a meat cleaver.  Every one assumes that Charlotte did it, but did she?  And some four decades later the question is still unanswered and Charlotte has become a recluse.  When her decaying mansion is threatened by highway construction, she turns to cousin Miriam for help... and with Miriam's arrival the mystery begins to unravel at last.
The great thing here is the cast.  Davis plays wildly, wildly over the top and gets away with it as only Davis can.  But the real acting interest here comes courtesy of Mary Astor, Agnes Moorehead, and Olivia de Havilland.  Star of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON, Astor makes her final screen appearance here in the small but pivitol role of Jewel Mayhew; Agnes Moorehead, one of Hollywood's most memorable character actresses, almost steals the show from Davis as the ... housekeeper Velma.  And de Havilland is quite remarkable.  Although she had a broad range, de Havilland had never played such a role as the perfidious cousin Miriam--but she brings it off with all the authority of a coiled rattler.
Given the broadness of the project, SWEET CHARLOTTE inevitably emerges as more ""camp"" than ""classic""--but whether you watch it as a thriller or as a cult comedy, the film is just flat-out fun.  Unfortunately, this particularly video tape is not: you'll actually find that the occasional television broadcast of the film offer better picture quality, and you may want to wait for a restored release.

As southern belle Charlotte Hollis, she spends the years between 1927 and 1964 self-exiled in her decaying mansion convinced she axed her married lover (Bruce Dern) to death. When the county seeks to demolish her home to put in a freeway, Charlotte looks to cousin Miriam (Olivia deHavilland) for help. Back in town where she was raised by Charlotte's powerful and rich father, Miriam connects again with Dr. Drew (Joseph Cotton), and only then do Charlotte's ghosts return to haunt her. Agnes Moorehead, as Charlotte's longtime maid, stumbles onto the reason the ghosts of long-lost love have returned, and she pays with her life. Gradually sinking into insanity, we feel a true sympathy for Charlotte. And it's absolutely fulfilling watching her give it to Miriam and Drew. The closing scene, with Charlotte being driven away by a sheriff's deputy but finding out, only then, that she didn't kill her lover 37 years earlier is a satisfying end. Davis is a joy here, and we can't help but give her the thumbs-up when her character fights her way from the edge of madness.",1040256000,6,1232,4.899521531100478
372847,5,6301798562,"Charlotte Hollis, a seemingly demented woman who lives in isolation in her dilapidated Southern Plantation-like home, is visited by her syrupy sweet, innocent cousin, Miriam. Because Miriam is into public relations (""sounds pretty dirty to me""! says Charlotte, in a tone of disgust) Miss Charlotte thinks her lovin' cousin will be able to legally prevent the awful people from tearing down her beloved home in order to build a new highway. Charlotte is adamant, and later furious when Miriam is completely inept concerning her predicament (""What do YOU think I asked you here for? COMP'NY?) Charlotte shows darlin' Miriam all the ""hate mail"" she's received from her nemesis, one Jewel Mayhew....Think you have it all figured out? Forget it, Charlie, you haven't even scratched the surface. When this movie was originally released theatrically back in 1964, a lot of people seemed to enjoy watching Bette Davis being tortured and acting like a crazed animal as Miriam Deering's darlin' cousin Charlotte. Largely due to the two lead performances of Davis and DeHavilland, it still has the ability to give viewers the stuff they crave. As Jewel Mayhew, Mary Astor is brilliant. Agnes Moorehead is a hoot as Velma Cruther, the po' white trash harridan of a housekeeper: during this time, she was also playing Endora on BEWITCHED! Played to the hilt, this movie is still great campy fun. Enjoy!",1038614400,4,1389,5.0964912280701755

Davis plays a faded southern belle whose married lover was murdered with an ax decades ago.  She is the primary suspect and has been ostracized by the community since then.  In the great tradition of southern gothic, she is truly haunted by the past, and spends most of her time there.

372896,3,6301798562,"Lawdy, every which way I look, there some belle that got bats in her belfry, and this time is Miss Bette Davis. Now of course, Bette did play an ""in touch with reality"" southern belle in ""Jezebel"", here she's the horror version of Blanche DuBois. The last time I saw this I was quite surprised, because it had turned up on NYC's Channel 13/PBS. I thought PBS was created so that the young'uns didn't HAVE to watch no-account slasher movies like ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte""! I mean, this was one of the staples of ""The 4:30 Movie"", that thankfully was over before Mom got home from work.
Well, notwithstanding all that, ""H...H,SC"" is one campy laugh from start to finish. It's one of those ""Now, the old actors and actresses who didn't make wise investments will do anything for a buck"" horror flicks of the 1960s that repeatedly featured former Warner Bros. contract players more than anyone else--goodness knows what might have happened to Humphrey Bogart if he had lived into the 1960s. Bette is rolling her big old eyes this way and that as she believes that she's being haunted by her shot-dead lover, while Olivia de Havilland is playing the saccharine villainess like an evil Mary Kay lady. When she finally turns on Bette in the infamous front seat of the car scene, boy, is she scary!
When I was a kid, all the decapitation stuff was as frightening as the dead rat/dead canary stuff in Baby Jane, but now while I would still find that gross, this here movie is up there with cult classics.

When her cousin Miriam comes a-calling Charlotte thinks Miriam's there to help her hang on to her decaying gothic mansion. Charlotte soon begins hearing and seeing ominous things, which doesn't improve her fragile state of mind. The cinematography, score, and performances give this unsettling thriller a real jolt.

372898,4,6301798562,"From the moment Olivia de Havilland sends the severed head rolling down the staircase at Bette Davis, you know it will be impossible to take Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte seriously.  Just sit back, relax, and let director Robert Aldrich and his great cast go right over the top in this story of a Southern woman played by Davis being driven insane by her vicious cousin de Havilland.  Davis is probably the only actress who could have gotten away with playing this character with any credibility.  She dives full force into the roll of the aging Charlotte who has never gotten over the brutal murder of her teenage love, a murder everyone thinks she committed.  She's joined by Joseph Cotten in a weak performance as her doctor, Agnes Moorehead at her hammiest and most entertaining as Charlotte's protective slob of a housekeeper, the great Mary Astor as the bitter wife of Charlotte's dead love, and numerous other top character actors.  But it's de Havilland as the evil cousin Miriam who really steals the show.  Audiences accustomed to seeing de Havilland in sweet, gentle ladylike rolls will be surprised by how convincingly she could play a villainess.  There is an unusually long prologue to the story that drags a little, but the rest of the film moves along from one bizarre moment to the next at a good pace, and as over the top as the film is, it's fun and entertaining to watch such a great cast clearly having a good time with such outlandish material.

This film is a truly great suspense thriller, and Davis and de Havilland are perfectly cast.  The film is full of unexpected twists and turns and is very atmospheric.

372900,4,6301798562,"Following the enormous success of ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"", producer-director Robert Aldrich quickly set about finding another lurid thriller for Bette Davis and Joan Crawford to do battle in.  He found the ideal follow-up in HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE.  But his grand reunion was not to be, as Joan Crawford cited illness and dropped out, and Olivia de Havilland replaced her.

Based on a story by Henry Farrell, CHARLOTTE centers around a reclusive Southern spinster called Charlotte Hollis (Bette Davis), who lives in a rambling old mansion in Hollisport with prickly maid Velma Crother (Agnes Moorehead).  Still tortured over the mysterious slaying of her married lover, Charlotte has lived in seclusion for over 40 years when the mansion is to be torn down to make way for a road development.  Charlotte arranges for her erstwhile cousin Miriam (Olivia de Havilland) to visit and help in stopping the impending demolition.  But Miriam has other things in mind.  Obviously having watched ""Gaslight"" far too many times, Miriam and family doctor Drew (Joseph Cotten) decide to exploit Charlotte's fragile grip on reality and scare her into a complete nervous breakdown, the goal being that Miriam will inherit the large family fortune.

Wildly-campy with some fabulous dialogue, HUSH...HUSH. SWEET CHARLOTTE is a more than worthy successor to ""Baby Jane"", but the film also has some genuine moments of pathos, characters that the audience truly take to heart and some inspired art direction and photography.

In a rare role reversal (normally she played the scare-monger rather than the victim) Bette Davis is amazing as Charlotte, heartbreaking, vulnerable and yet with a strength of mind and character.

In another rare departure, Olivia de Havilland plays the villainess with relish, enjoying the juicy dialogue and generally having a ball.  Her glacial reserve and crisp beauty adds an interesting angle to her character's sinister motives.

His appalling Southern accent aside, Joseph Cotten's Drew was another memorable addition to his impressive gallery of baddies.  Oscar-nominee Agnes Moorehead, as the acid-tongued Velma, is probably the greatest performance in the entire film.  Mary Astor came out of retirement to play Jewel Mayhew, the widowed wife of Charlotte's murdered lover (film fans will remember that Davis and Astor also played duelling dames in the classic ""Great Lie"").  A young Bruce Dern is impressive as the ill-fated sweetheart John Mayhew; as is Victor Buono (also from ""Baby Jane"") in his flashback role as Charlotte's imposing Daddy.

Frank DeVol's Oscar-nominated score perfectly sets the scene, with the eerie lullabye-like Title Song becoming an integral part of the plot.  A true masterpiece of the genre, HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE is a must for every self-respecting film fanatic.",978912000,,2834,5.375565610859729
372901,5,6301798562,"My initiation into the wonderful world of Bette Davis was at the age of eight, when I begged my father to take me to see ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" at the Center Theater in Sunnyside. I just figured it was a ""horror"" movie. Well, seeing Bette Davis and company, it was love at first sight! ""Charlotte"" boasts a cast of ""old vets"" chewing up the scenery as if their lives depended on it. Miss Davis storms and rages and descends into near-madness as only she could, Olivia DeHavilland, who is a very fine and diversified actress, portrays Bette's sugar-coated rattlesnake of a cousin in a most convincing manner, and Agnes Moorehead-well, what can I say? Her slovenly, white-trash Velma Crother is a sight to behold-the woman was a scene-stealer. Add to this witch's brew an oily Joseph Cotten, the grand Mary Astor, Victor Buono, George Kennedy, and Ellen Corby in a small part, and you're in for a hoot of an evening! The films is a little too long, but with such company, who cares? Nowadays, where ""horror"" films are populated by 24-years-old and younger performers, I can only think about the ""good old days"" when the genre boasted seasoned performers whose life experiences didn't take place in shopping malls. ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" is an old-fashioned blood-and-thunder melodrama enacted by performers who had years of theater and screen experience under their belts. There are also nods to ""Diabolique"",""Gaslight"", and ""Eyes Without a Face"" in this deep-fried fag-hag extravaganza.
