4581559,5,B0055V6EX6,"The Last Mountain is a documentary about mountain top coal mining in the Appalachian mountains and the effects it has not only on the environment, but on the small communities that call those mountains home. Boosted by the support of environmental lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr., the people affected share their stories and their anger toward the mining companies that are destroying their homes and livelihood.

Though the movie is very anti-coal in general, I found it to be very eye opening to large cooperation greed. Massey Energy is the guilty one here, led by a money hungry CEO who fed the wallets of local and White House politicians to overlook all of the policy and codes they were breaking. Unfortunately, there is an inner battle within these mountain valley towns because they are extremely poor and most of the jobs are in coal mining.  But Massey banned unions so they could pay lower wages and have slowly been eliminating massive numbers of jobs and replacing those workers with ""more efficient"" machinery. Not to mention the horribly low amount of taxes they pay to these communities.

But the townsfolk have worked the mines for generations; they think it is their honor and they do not see the true disservice their own employer is doing to them and their families. While they battle each other, their neighbors are dying (6 deaths from brain tumors in one town caused by polluted well water), their air is not clean to breathe, their communities are disappearing (the piece about one ghost town with just two people left living in it was heart wrenching), and their mountains are disappearing too.

Kennedy says it best in the film, ""My kids wake up and have to breathe bad air today because some company paid a politician a whole bunch of money.""  There's hope in the end as one community member is pushing for wind turbine energy which is cleaner and will sustain more jobs and save the mountains. But overall the outcry and support this story has received is truly amazing.  It definitely touched me and made me want to get involved as soon as the movie was over.

We truly are raping the world, and it all comes down to politics and money.  Don't believe me?  Watch this film and decide for yourself!",1333324800,5,2221,4.733160621761658
4581560,4,B0055V6EX6,"The 1970s disaster film era gave us the likes of EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, where the unthinkable was no more than the escape of the movies.  But especially since the 1980s, the moneyed interests have caused such destruction to the world that today recent documentaries about the damage - GASLAND; TAPPED; COUNTDOWN TO ZERO; THE END OF POVERTY?; HOT COFFEE; VANISHING OF THE BEES - are the disaster films, leaving us to wish we were viewing fiction.

The 2011 feature THE LAST MOUNTAIN, worthy of inclusion in a True Disaster Film Festival with the above named works, presents coal mining firm Massey Energy's devastation of a West Virginia valley, where the company blows tops off mountains and spills 300 million gallons of sludge into rivers.  Steve McQueen does not come to the rescue, but activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., arrives to work with Mountain State families to fight back.  With no less than the governor of West Virginia in  Massey's pocket, the people have their work cut out.

A key scene in THE LAST MOUNTAIN shows Kennedy and a mining industry lackey swapping notes.  The lackey dodges questions and denies reality, and for a moment instead of a disaster film it may as well be the comedy YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and  hunchback Marty Feldman asking, ""What hump?""

4581561,5,B0055V6EX6,"I live in East Tennessee, not far from the site of the coal ash spill of recent. I had heard of what goes on up in the mountains, but I hadn't seen much of it (thankfully we have the National Park). This is a beautifully executed documentary that shines light on the evils of what is going on. It could have been a political bashing, but it wasn't. It was a story about people who are often cast out of society because of lack of education and a pervading social stigma that they aren't as good as the rest; however, one of the most powerful men in America practically lived with these people. Robert Kennedy Jr. shed light on an inconvenient truth: the coal companies aren't bringing wealth to Appalachian, they are draining it. The turning point for me is when Mr. Kennedy says to a top coal man that if they are bringing so much prosperity to West Virginia, why is it one of the poorest states in the country?
Overall, this is a wonderful, shining documentary. Thank you Mr. Kennedy.",1325721600,9,986,4.423076923076923

4581563,5,B0055V6EX6,"Very informative and moving film from one of the dark chapters of cooporation behaviour in the USA. It covers land destruction, water and air pollution as well as climate change very well. We are from switzerland and far away in our mountains, but through this film we could connect and because of climate change this fight is important for us, too. I hope that many people watch this movie.",1323820800,2,391,4.681159420289855
4581564,3,B0055V6EX6,"I watched this documentary on Australian Broadcast Company and therefore didn't squander any money on a DVD, which would have been a waste.  When I saw that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr had  an involvement in it I assumed that it would turn into a far left subjective attempt to indict the coal companies for what ever he feels is wrong with the environment and I was not mistaken.  This opinion was first formulated when I use to listen to him on Air America and that was difficult to do  because he has a radio voice as pleasing as some one running a finger nail across a black board.  That aside, his unsubstantiated stance on anthropogenic global warming caused me to realize that this was not a person given to logically analyzing probably any problem let alone the one regarding coal extraction from West VA.  That there are health problems that evolve from this type of mining for those living in the direct area is probably true but Kennedy tries to carry it over to his being afraid to eat fish from the Atlantic  because of coal being used to generate electricity and that is not being objective because mercury is not just coming from coal but from  burning of mercury-containing products at municipal waste combustion and medical waste incinerators, burning of sewage sludge that contains mercury from dental uses, some of Kennedy's mercury might be coming from his own amalgam fillings, and releases attributable to broken mercury-containing products.

I heard Kennedy bring up mercury in fish that he might eat and this shows how little he has educated himself about that issue  as well as the positive impact that coal fired generating plants have on the welfare of the United States.

""EPA also confessed that U.S. power plants actually contribute a mere 3 percent of the total mercury deposited in computer-modeled American watersheds and subsequently, in fish tissue. Citizens will justifiably wonder where the other 97 percent comes from, and why we should spend so much money for so little benefit.

Third, the agency's estimates for mercury exposure risks are solely for ""hypothetical female subsistence consumers"" who daily eat almost a pound of fish that they catch in U.S. streams, rivers, and lakes over a 70-year lifetime (less than 1 percent of U.S. women). For the rest of American women, who eat mostly ocean fish purchased at a grocery on a far less frequent basis EPA's rules are irrelevant.""

I have not been to West Virginia and therefore can not assess the problem in a logical, first hand manner.  I do not think that this practice of mountain top removal mining needs to be done when the west has so much good low sulfur coal on relatively flat ground that has no population centers near by .  This is where the coal that is necessary for the production of  electricity in the United States should come from.  To attempt to use the harm done by mountain top mining as a way to sway public opinion against using coal for energy production is ludicrous and this is what Kennedy is attempting to do. Abundant, reliable, affordable energy is America's lifeblood. Everything we make, ship, eat, drive, enjoy and do requires energy, 85% of which is still hydrocarbon-based. Nearly half of all our electricity is generated with coal; for 26 states, 48-98% of their electricity comes from coal.
""Figure 2: Net Generation Shares by Energy Source: Total (All Sectors),
Year-to-Date through March, 2011""
(The pie chart shows this): ""Coal, 44.7%; Natural Gas, 20.6%; Nuclear,20.5%; Hydroelectric Conventional, 8.4%; Other Energy Sources, 5.2% and Petroleum .8%""

It seems that Kennedy's interest in green energy is being funded by the tax payer and I'm sure that he profits from this in the same manner that perpetrators of  the  Solyndra scam did.

""President John F. Kennedy's nephew, Robert Kennedy, Jr., netted a $1.4 billion bailout for his company, BrightSource, through a loan guarantee issued by a former employee-turned Department of Energy official.
It's just one more in a string of eye-opening revelations by investigative journalist and Breitbart editor Peter Schweizer in his explosive new book, Throw Them All Out.""

""I wrote this about a year and a half ago, another interesting little fact.
Many people do not know that Robert Kennedy Jr. and Bright Source have the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in Mission, SD leased up for wind energy development. That should be no big deal, at face value, right?
Wrong.
Their Joint-Venture Partner is Hugo Chavez and Venezuela.
It is done through a series of Front, and Dummy Companies.""

The producers of this documentary attempted to convince the viewer that wind is the energy source of the future and that is just not true.  Wind is first off not reliable as was witness in Texas during their hot summer when demand was high for air-conditioners and when it is hot the wind doesn't blow and the same is generally true when it is very cold and demand is high  and therefore not easily managed on the grid, it is not cheap either and not efficient.

An Ill Wind Off Cape Cod
By ROBERT F. KENNEDY Jr.
Is this a sign of hypocrisy and ""not in my back"" yard at its most extreme?  It is just typical green nonsense at its worst.

""Cape Wind's proposal involves construction of 130 giant turbines whose windmill arms will reach 417 feet above the water and be visible for up to 26 miles. These turbines are less than six miles from shore and would be seen from Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Hundreds of flashing lights to warn airplanes away from the turbines will steal the stars and nighttime views. The noise of the turbines will be audible onshore. A transformer substation rising 100 feet above the sound would house giant helicopter pads and 40,000 gallons of potentially hazardous oil.
According to the Massachusetts Historical Commission, the project will damage the views from 16 historic sites and lighthouses on the cape and nearby islands. The Humane Society estimates the whirling turbines could every year kill thousands of migrating songbirds and sea ducks.""

""As of June 2009, Denmark has the most expensive electricity tariff in Europe with tax included, followed by Italy. Ireland has the highest pre-tax tariff. France has the lowest pre-tax price for electricity in Europe, at 4.75 Eurocents/kWh, and second-lowest price with tax of European countries. A comparative list of June 2009 prices for Europe may be found in the European Household Electricity Price Index.""

This is the truth about the cost of wind power:

With the United States economy seeming to be in a perpetual decline and having a nation debt of $15 trillion, there is no reason to not use clean burning coal from the west that the nation has a 300 year supply of to satisfy those that push an unproven theory about a trace gas that is essential for life on earth as we know it,CO2,that makes up .036% of the atmosphere and is one and one half times heavier that air being the driver of something as complex as the earth's climate.",1322179200,,7374,4.903536977491961
4581565,5,B0055V6EX6,"This documentary almost lost me mid-flight, given its initial relentless compounding of the horrific fate of those trapped inside a mountain-top removal vise in Appalachia. It's only redemption came from intermittant flashes of precocious Robert Kennedy, Jr. engaging in civil disobediance at age 8 on behalf of Mother Nature and visiting his uncle, President Kennedy, in Oval office bearing an animal gift, thus opening door to deliver his pro-environmental message to JFK's astonished Cabinet~
So Bobby's son returns to West Virginia coal mines, as successful enviro-protection attorney, to introduce us to local activists there, fighting both Massey Coal and state EPA -- and the plot thickens. Outsiders enter later -- as monkey-wrenchers and tree-sitters -- in an attempt to shut down the plant.
Quite an educational tour here: from inside the corrupt coal-mining industry, through its collusion with both state and federal politicians to side-track the renewables (and con the public), into the dire health consequences left in its wake -- including brain tumors.
The good news, however, is worth the wait. I highly recommend this for family viewing; it's about our future~",1322092800,,1179,5.448087431693989

Knowing little about the subject before seeing the film I watched with great fascination this moving true story about a communities struggle to save a mountain in Appalachia.

In the end I found I had been been given an introduction to the consequences of this nations consistently destructive environmental policies that allow corporate polluters to get away with destroying entire communities and wreaking havoc with natural resources that belong to the public.

This film deserves to be seen and by a much wider audience!  People should see what these Coal polluting companies are doing to our environment and once they do I 'm sure they'll understand why they should all be just shut down and advocate this nation moving toward a more efficient energy policy, and one that does not destroy entire landscapes.",1320105600,13,938,5.032258064516129

I would definitely put this documentary up there for all time rankings.  Cinematography was on the high end and the jaw-dropping facts and moments were ample.

I didn't give it a 5 because I felt that it needed just a little more facts, and it also seemed to be going along well following local residents until a Kennedy got involved and then he somehow became the superhero of the story.  Now I don't mind politicians helping out, but it seemed like maybe they edited this to show more of him than they needed to.  Perhaps more of a marketing thing than anything.

4581573,1,B0055V6EX6,"Massey Energy's CEO story and every statistic presented in this DVD was about few decades of mining history.  Twenty five miners who lost their lives in Upper Big Branch Mine was in 2009 with that greedy Massey's Corporation with 500 violations and although this movie was produced in 2011, it seemed to blame everything on Republicans. Democrats have been in charge as well and does not appear that they have done anything either since not only no one is in jail those corporations are still doing what they used to do. DVD was claiming that Kennedy was on miners' side but yet while Kennedy was talking in the rally, miners where against him and shouting ""Get Out"" as well as arguing with him...

Majority of governments are incompetent and dishonest, nothing new there, it has been like that and possibly stay that way regardless whoever is in charge unless people demand a change. Energy is the same issue as immigration, social security, health care, etc. No politician has/will jeopardize his/her future regardless what side they are on and they are not going to give up their benefits for anyone either.

4581574,5,B0055V6EX6,"One of the most informative, accurate and timely documentaries I have ever seen. It gives a ""first-hand"" look at what 99% of Americans never see --- the raping of the beautiful mountains of West Virginia and the devastating health problems being caused by one corporation, seeking the almighty dollar regardless of the human tragedy it causes. It further portrays how politicians are in the pockets of this company by allowing them to flaunt EPA regulations and then pay a paltry amount in fines, only to immediately resume the illegal activities they conduct. Furthermore, it clearly states how the Obama administration ""legalized"" much of what they are doing by changing a single word in the Clean Water Act of 1978.

Everyone in the United States needs to see this documentary and what happens when politicians value campaign contributions more than human life.

The people that put these commercials on tv should be put in jail for lieing to all Americans. Along wih the criminals in the coal buisness. Including the senetors that endorse this. This movie is harsh and needs to be to bring this issue to the public. this is a prime example of the Govt. turning its back on the people of this country.
