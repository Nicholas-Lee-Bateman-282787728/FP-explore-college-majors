4490036,5,B004X181VM,"As a huge fan of MI-5, I cannot complain about the fabulous content of the episodes - except that its over. I love the suspense, the characters that grow over time, the stories that seem plausible at every turn and the incredible creativity which leads me to not predicting the outcome within the first 15 minutes.  I'm always looking for shows that don't so obviously have the same ""types"" of people who are predictable and easily tell me who did what, who is a good guy or bad guy. Not to mention, a series that although it doesn't ignore the mistakes made by the US and Britain, we are not the endless purposeful bad guys that most tv shows make us out to be. There are bad guys and sometimes they may be American or British but they are not bad guys BECAUSE they are American or British.  But I digress, it is not just a good series because of the wide variety of bad guys and good guys - it was always in-depth, considering the complicated nuances of allies and enemies and how the lines blur and how politics can interfere with protecting your country, how good guys go bad and the thankless but necessary jobs that none of us ever see being done.

What an incredible series, it will be sorely missed as it is one of the few current series that I always pre-ordered. On a different note - I also want to give a kudos for what was reported as ""never seen on tv"". Since I have no way of verifying it, but to trust TVSHOWSONDVD.com when they report it, I will assume it is true.

THANK YOU MI-5!  FINALLY! Someone has stepped out of the concrete jail of tv rules and produced a show for direct to dvd. Typically,the PTB have no ability ""at the top"" to see any other way except for the way it has always been, no matter how technology changes, no matter how advertising has changed (consumers will do ANYTHING to avoid commercials-the PTB can't stop it but have no ideas except to keep going the same way as always, trying to find ways to force us to watch them instead if finding new ways to fund tv production), no matter how ancient and worthless nielsen ratings are, no matter how impossible it is to produce high quality shows on a shoestring,they are glued to the past-so we end up with cheap faked reality trash, lots of shows telling us how to live, dress, eat, etc. and a few decent shows that are slated for cancellation before airing the 3rd episode, mostly because they actually cost money to produce them, pay wages GASP!, and actually shoot and edit and re-write and develop characters and have sets to work at instead of a home with a bunch of cameras and staged fights etc...

I always thought there would be a market for direct-to-dvd, whether a continuing series or a new series with alot of good marketing, I thought someone just needed to do it and sell it well, and forget the tv executives who can't see out of the box to produce a decent tv show, or a new season of a tv show.  Perhaps this is the beginning of a real, highly acclaimed show taking a risk and producing a season direct-to-dvd, for a reasonable price, successfully.  OR...it's a fluke, a brief moment of genius, ignored by everyone except the fans. Or worse yet, maybe it aired on tv and the website was wrong and the whole kudos is pointless.

But I for one would be thrilled to have good solid dramas and suspense and mystery with character development and multiple seasons in the works with great stories and plots and acting and know it is worth watching because I am getting a whole season or more, up-front rather than committing myself to a show on tv that may or may not continue - leaving me annoyed and frustrated that I wasted my time on 2 or 3 great episodes of a show that disappeared without a chance. I usually record them and save them and if it gets a whole season, I watch them, if it disappears, I didn't waste time getting excited about a great show and waiting for the next episode or season and it never comes because you must have a solid, huge audience of a certain age, who has nielsen boxes, committed to the show, watching within 48 hours of the airing, for the first and second episode or you are history.  No building characters, no building a fanbase - it must be there from the start with specific demographics. Meanwhile, other shows get renewed before the 2nd episode airs because ? I don't know why but it makes no sense.

Congratulations to MI5 for an incredible 10 season run, and the willingness, creativity, and ability to produce a final season for the fans regardless of whether or not it will air on tv...and MAYBE for opening the door to a new way to produce decent tv shows.",1331078400,7,4607,4.395539906103286
4490037,5,B004X181VM,"It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since MI-5 first began in 2002, and what a ten-year run it has been. MI-5 has over this decade consistently shown itself to be one of the most intelligent, exciting, and thought-provoking shows ever put on television, and I can say without hesitation that Season Ten continues squarely in that tradition. And without giving any spoilers and without trying to reminisce too much here in this, I can say that I, like millions of people around the world, will now sorely miss being able to watch the latest MI-5 productions as they came out each year.

MI-5 is the government agency in the UK that is designed to deal with domestic security, perhaps roughly analogous to the FBI in the US. ""5"" is made up of normal people who join the agency ""in defense of the realm,"" and deals with the threats and personal sacrifice each person makes while fulfilling their role in the organization.

Season Ten is the shortest season made during the series entire run (a total of only six episodes), but, in a way, that makes sense because the show is wrapping up the last of the major, unresolved issues from the show's final story arc. But the season still maintains everything that makes MI-5 great: dramatic contradictions, complicated and suspenseful situations, thought-provoking writing, and characters that we come to admire and ""root"" for as we watch. This is a show that unquestionably is choosing to end production while still at the top of its form, rather than withering away as we have seen in so many television shows over the years.

I always recommend to anyone wishing to watch MI-5 that they start at Season One, and watch the shows in order. The first pilot episode (Season One) is not all that strong, and most every MI-5 watcher largely agrees with that assessment of the opening episode. (It's not difficult, however, to see the immense talent that is being assembled to develop the show; but, like many shows, it took a couple of initial episodes to get the show figured out from the production end.) But just grit your teeth and get through that first episode or two, and use it to acclimate yourself to the characters, approach, and way of thinking needed to engage in the series. And then watch the show take off as the season progresses. By the end of that first season, if you're not hooked and already purchasing the next set of season two DVD's, I'd be very surprised. The show is extremely well written, and makes use of a slew of talented actors from the first season all the way to the last. Directing and production values are so good that each episode is more like a 60-minute movie than a television show. It will entertain you, but it will also make you think about the difficult decisions, dangers, and contradictions the security services face all the time as they follow their mission.

And it just gets better and better, season after season. MI-5 defies every standard rule of television by consistently producing seasons and shows that get better with each successive year. You can't believe that it is possible to maintain the dramatic levels it does once you get through Season Two, but to our surprise, it does, and then, does it again in Season Three. And Four. And Five. And on and on. The show maintains the most amazing level of drama and suspense throughout its entire run, all the time making you think about the issues surrounding the subject of national security and the security services.

MI-5. I'm afraid it will be a long time before we ever see another show like it.",1331078400,11,3556,4.6832

4490039,5,B004X181VM,"Harry Pearce, played by Peter Firth, may go down as the most universally liked/disliked secret agent man in the UK. We have seen him through ten years of espionage and secrets, and we have just begun to really know him. When MI-5 started in 2002, or Spooks as the UK knows this series, Harry Pearce was the head of Section D, a counter-terrorism division of the British Security Service. As the series ended, Harry was the head of Section D. We have been through a great deal, Dear Harry, and this does feel like a death in the family.

The tenth season starts with a planning of a strategic partnership between Russia and the UK. An old friend Ilya Gavrik played by Jonathan Hyde returns secretly to the UK, along with his wife, Elena, played by Alice Krige. Elena is one of the most beautiful of women, so fragile at times she looks like she could break. They come to the UK along with their son, Sasha, to form this new partnership. But, as always there are so many twists and turns within the Mi-5, we barely get the characters straight when they become unsettled. Harry, who has so many secrets inside of him, has many more to tell. Ruth Evershed, played so brilliantly and understated by Nicola Walker. Let me break here to mention that someone at some time must have said, why is Ruth's hair such a mess. She is mousy, but has such a pretty face and a good haircut would have done wonders. So, we know this is deliberate. All the other beautiful spies don't have to play off Ruth. Ruth keeps Harry honest, well, she tries. The Harry/Ruth relationship is the one true thing about this series. This series of six episodes are jam packed, and the episodes all deal with the Russian pact, but interspersed with other secret agents goings-ons. Each episode leads up to the big bang, so to speak, but along the way, little bits and drabs of information are shared. Oh, you are going to like this series.

There are other characters in this tenth series, but they are really just backdrop to Harry and Ruth. We do, however, remember all of the agents we loved and we reminisce, but none of these spooks do. This was a fitting farewell, I think. No, I will not give away anything. Suffice it to say, this is what had to occur. The writing is superb, the acting superb, the photography superb. One of my favorite series, really. Even though many spy thriller writers thought this series too far fetched, I bought into it. I knew Harry was there to make everything OK for us all, to fight evil and to show us a little bit of good in the world. However, Harry, we hardly knew ye.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-03-12

4490040,5,B004X181VM,"This was a gripping conclusion to an absolutely wonderful series.  American TV doesn't come close to this caliber of writing and acting.  The series had it's up and downs throughout the years, but overall it was outstanding in every aspect.  These final episodes were without a doubt some of the best, and I will miss this show.  If you're looking at this as your first purchase in the series, then make sure you get some of the first years, too.",1330646400,7,446,4.5375
4490041,5,B004X181VM,"Like other reviewers have said, this season is quite intense.  What I have always loved about Spooks is that they really keep you in suspense for quite a long time.  And no one is safe in the cast from being cut.  When you think about it, it's better than typical American shows, because in the end, you know the cast will stay together.  Not so with Spooks, which made it refreshing.

Part of me was hoping Harry and Ruth would end up together, but in the frame of things and in the vein in which this show was made, the ending did make sense.  I just can't believe it's over.  I really can't.

The BBC is amazing, and constantly does things of real substance.  I rarely watch television in America; can't stand all the reality crap that TV has become, but every once in a while, a series like Spooks comes along and shows you not all TV is bad.",1330473600,49,846,4.2375
4490042,5,B004X181VM,"I might even reconsider my stance on government support for the ""Arts"" if top quality TV like Spooks (AKA MI-5) were subsidized in the USA and given a decade on the air.  I watched all 10-seasons over the course of the last 3-years (generally watching a season in 2-3 sittings).  One not so subtle difference which makes Spooks (and many long running UK series) difference from most US shows is the propensity to turn over staff (AKA kill off and/or fade away).  It is a testament to the writing that despite such frequent turnovers that the show has remained relevant.

There was a time when there was 3-top notch shows in the genre on TV (24-USA, The Border - CAN & Spooks) and then there were none!

I would start looking for offers where all 10-seasons (series in the UK) can be purchased as part of a promotion.  A very relevant show that isn't afraid to take on controversy, including showing the USA in a less than favorable light.

As another reviewer referenced, a very emotional conclusion.  My highest rating.",1330300800,16,1020,4.627777777777778

4490063,5,B004X181VM,"I've rarely followed ten seasons of any television series. The few exceptions started with Hart to Hart and Moonlighting in the 1980's, and these series never survived a full ten seasons. After renting the first nine seasons of the British spy thriller MI-5 which series title is called Spooks in the United Kingdom, and watching with full attention, I was apprehensive the producers could hit a home run.

To my astonishment, the did.

This season is the grand finale of a magnificently executed drama that sets the platinum standard for spy thrillers. It's what James Bond and every other spy drama wants to grow up to become!

MI-5 ended like a Greek tragedy, for sure, but then again, as anyone knows who has seen the first nine series, it *is* a modern-day Greek tragedy of the highest moral object-lesson order.

MI-5 is superb in all aspects.  Storyline, narrative, casting, acting is so much better than American TV the match-up is not even close.

After such an explosive and addictive 9 seasons, I guess I can understand - where do you go from there?  How do you top that?  I think they tried, but failed.  SPOILER:  I could care less about any of the new cast and was particularly mad that they killed off Tarik.  The scene with him in the cab coming to the realization that he was going to die was so sad!  But besides that, I found myself nodding off thru a lot of it - it just wasn't very engaging.  I almost wish they did a 2 hour movie, consolidated the Russian/Harry plot, and just ended it.  The last episode was a great payoff though, and I love how they ended it - especially with a certain former Spook popping back in to take care of business.  That was the most epic 10 seconds!  And a great way to bring everything full circle.",1374451200,,913,4.090395480225989

It is a sad commentary that the BBC can put out such excellent programs and the U.S. market produces such junk! I have quit a few BBC products and look forward to any thing they produce.

4490146,5,B004X181VM,"After watching 9 seasons of MI-5, I knew there were a few things to expect. Through the years, one main story follows through the entire season while other adventures take an episode or two. Also, it is a given that at least one of the MI-5 spies will die in the season while another trusted spy will be a double agent. Someone on the inside is always passing information to the other side and finally, the CIA are always the bad guys loathed by MI-5 chief Harry Peace. Another constant is the person or radical group is always bent up on blowing up London or another part of the UK. Finally and often sadly, a spy or more often a reliable insider, is sacrificed for the good of the agency. That is MI-5 in a nutshell yet despite its predictablility, it kept many of us enthralled through the years.

I watched each season as soon as it was available on DVD. I hesitated to watch the final season since I accidentally read a spoiler and knew one story line would not end the way I hoped. I finally had to see the end of this remarkable series. MI-5 has grown and evolved through the years but there has been one constant - Harry Pearce ran the show all 10 season. No other character was seen in all 10 seasons. Lovely Nicola Walker (my series favorite) as Ruth Evershed was gone a couple of seasons but was the next long-lived character.

Another consistent feature of MI-5 is the remarkable stylized visuals. It feels like you are watching an expensive Hollywood Thriller full of special effects and explosions yet this is a BBC TV series. How did they afford such a lavish production? The Brits do it right when it comes to TV.

Season 10 starts with the thawing of relations between Great Britain and Russia but the Cold War is not dead and the espionage continues bringing in Ilya and Elena, a Russian politician and his wife, into the scene. As luck would have it Harry and Elena have a much more intimate history. Britain and Russia hope to strengthen political and economic ties and here is where the CIA comes in to thwart the plans. Or is everything as it seems? It does get confusing as you throw in the non-related story of various terrorists planning to destroy London. There is never a minute of rest for the MI-5 team.

Watch MI-5 for the sheer beauty of the scenery and the photography and not so much for the storyline which gets repetitious and confusing at times. By the end of the series, it becomes clear that ONLY exceptionally attractive men and women can be spies for the MI-5. What about Joe average? It becomes a beauty contest as the spies sometimes use their sexiness to investigate a potential threat. Watch the show. You'll see what I mean.

Sadly, all good things must end and maybe MI-5 has lived a longer life than it should. The series ending is a pure disappointment to fans and unsatisyfing on all levels. We deserve more but it sure was a good fun. There is a also a brief cameo of a MI-5 spy from the beginning. We are left hanging wondering if he is back on the job with the MI-5 or has he been working for the other side?

There is only one extra feature and it is the top 10 MI-5 moments and it is well worth watching if you have been a fan all along. Most of the top 10 moments are the ingenious ways characters have died or left the MI-5 alive (there are only a couple who made it out in one piece).

I'll always wonder who the next cast of sexy spies would have been had there been a season 11. As it is, we'll always have Harry Peace and a remarkable 10 seasons of MI-5.",1361318400,,3514,4.331306990881459

They were also a great deal of things that just kind of slipped away.  All in all I think they should have either stopped it after they killed off Adam or just not killed him off.

4490192,5,B004X181VM,"I've rarely followed ten seasons of any television series. The few exceptions started with Hart to Hart and Moonlighting in the 1980's, and these series never survived a full ten seasons. After renting the first nine seasons of the British spy thriller MI-5 which series title is called Spooks in the United Kingdom, and watching with full attention, I was apprehensive the producers could hit a home run.

To my astonishment, the did.

This season is the grand finale of a magnificently executed drama that sets the platinum standard for spy thrillers. It's what James Bond and every other spy drama wants to grow up to become!

MI-5 ended like a Greek tragedy, for sure, but then again, as anyone knows who has seen the first nine series, it *is* a modern-day Greek tragedy of the highest moral object-lesson order. It demonstrates the complete folly of this ancient world we live in, replete with all its ""modern"" glory and high-tech, illustriously played out like a modern-day drama that future generations may view like we view Casblanca and Biblical historical epoch thrillers, with the ancient Roman poet Ovid's Metamorphoses (from the Greek word ""Transformations"") coming to mind.

You want your son or daughter to understand why we must tow the line on terrorism and some Middle Eastern ideologies for our very survival and that of future generations on Earth? This could be required viewing in schools in that regard, because it reveals a terrible truth about our times. You can wish it were any other way, but things are as they are. We can try to change the world, but we must live in it, in all its midieval horror, if we are to approximate peaceful, ""normal"" lives with the little time we have in the grand scheme. The fact is we must get along on the limited planetary surface of this sphere we call Earth, and since most of us have lifespans less than a century, we must act pragmatically and for the mutual benefit of us all. That is the mission of Britains intelligent services (depicted by the fictional representation of MI-5).

This series, with is synergistic connections of epic acting talent, production, screenplay and scrip writing, should be considered a national treasure on the British Isles, and a lesson to the world that diplomacy only works in conjunction with skillfully and masterfully executed dtente.

I feel so strongly about what I just said, that I not only purchased MI-5 Season 10 on Amazon, but I purchased the first nine seasons in a box set edition on DVDSea.com's website for just $58. I want to secure these videos before they skyrocket, as popular series often tend to do. It's difficult to convince anyone that it's worth investing 72 hours in watching at least that many episodes of a series, especially when in the first few seasons the show is so violent that many people I've spoken to couldn't continue the ""dark journey"" through the valley of British intelligence.

However, for what it's worth, it gets easier thereafter. Someone suggested that maybe it got ""easier"" because I became callous to violence, but I'm a very sensitive person, and believe it's rather because the best values cause you to rise above fear. Even the Bible comments that fear exercises a restraint, and the path to the greatest good often leads you through valleys of fear.",1338163200,6,3303,4.845744680851064

4490194,2,B004X181VM,"I was very much looking forward to season 10, and finished watching it last night.  What a disappointment.  Firstly, there were only six episodes, not the usual ten.  This made it very difficult to connect with new members of the team.

In addition, the new members were bland.  And, the section chief in particular, wasn't a good actor.  She seemed to be reading her lines, rather than 'living' them.  It just wasn't credible that someone like this would be a leader of anything, let alone a section of MI-5.

The series has always been known for its ruthless disposal of characters, but given the shortened number of episodes, and number of new cast members, it seemed unnecessary to remove an established member of the team early on.

The story was fast paced, and complex, but unfortunately, even less credible that usual! I just can't see MI-5 kidnapping a high ranking US diplomat/CIA operative.

The two stalwart characters, Harry and Ruth labored to keep the story going, but without much success. And, the trio of actors potraying russians fell well short of their task. Their fake accents, and the fake 'russian' music accompanying their scenes, made them almost comedic.

I don't understand why the producers decided this season was necessary.  Season 9 was one of the best, in my opinion, Harry and Ruth's relationship was dealt with early on, and the final scene with Lucas North 'doing the right thing', would have been a fitting end to an excellent series.",1335398400,7,1471,4.863453815261044

4490208,3,B004X181VM,"First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 29 March 2012

As most (or all?) other reviewers, I have seen all of the series and all of the episodes within the series and have all of the series' DVDs which I hugely enjoyed and still enjoy, again, and again. So, I am certainly a big fan of the series, among many, many others. All of them have been hugely entertaining and exciting, however unrealistic the various episodes are. Another reviewer saw the series as a cross between James Bond/Jason Bourne and John Le Carr's The Man Who Came In From the Cold (I would have rather picked Tinker, Soldier, Soldier, Spy, but nevermind). There is something to that, but it's not quite it.

The last set of episodes has some - but only some - of the ingredients that have made all of the series so successful. However, it also has flaws which have developed and increased over the years and have become increasingly obvious.

The first one is about what ""Johnsie"" terms the tiny team (Section D) ""saving the world"" every ten minutes and episode after episode. This is, of course, one of these melodramatic effects that has kept us following the series over the years with bated breath. It has been mostly hugely effective as far as I am concerned: I have lapped it all up and loved every minute of it, like all good little fan, while knowing that this bears as much resemblance to reality as James Bond does. Over time, however, I felt that the series was increasingly relying on this sort of ploy to compensate other growing problems and that even these ploys were getting a bit worn and overused.

This was particularly obvious in Series 10, with a number of scenarios showing marked similarities in scenarios with previous episodes, as if someone had run out of any original ideas and was busy recycling ols recipes in the hope that they would be just as successful as the first time. There were also some almost desperate attempts to come up with something original by multiplying twists and counter-twists up to the point where it becomes rather implausible (and not only unrealistic, which, of course, is something that lay people like us are perhaps not the best placed to appreciate).

The second flaw that grows through the years relates to the Series tendency to get rid off its characters, preferably by killing them off one by one so that by the end of the Series, Harry is the only character surviving and still in place from Series 1. The death rate is so high as to make serving in the trenches during World War I or on the Russian Front during World War II seem like a picnic. I understand that this might largely have to do with actors, which after having shot a couple of series, may want or have to move on to something else and that bumping them off offers a more dramatic effect than having them ""decommissioned"". Series 10 carries this to new highs with the Team's last casualty being killed almost by accident, a bit like an afterthough, by being (improbably?) stabbed with a piece of glass that was conveniently laying around.

The third flaw is that this impressive death rate, which is much more dramatic but much less likely that having people drop out because of burnout, leads to numerous characters walsing in and out of the series. The problem with this particular series, as other reviewers have noted, is that the ""new"" (""newish"") ones this time round (Erin,Dimitri and Callum) do not live up to the standards set by Quinn, Adam or Ross, for instance. I have no inttention to come up with disparaging comments regarding certain actors' performances. However, I am also among those who felt that this lot was not as ""good"" as the previous ones - ""wooden"" as another reviewer said. Another very improbable turn was the fate of Beth. Regardless of the quality of the actor's performance, can anyone believe that Harry, once he had become the boss again, would not have even tried to get back on a grid a proved and competent member of his team?

Another consequence of systematically privileging dramatic effects over plausibility is that the series appear increasingly implausible over time as each set has to ""up the ante"" when compared to the previous one. So this one reaches new highs with the burglary of the US embassy and the kidnapping of one of the CIA's senior men. Another piece which seems rather exagerated is the impression that each and every other service seems determined to do something nasty to poor UK, starting by its bullying US allies (and including, in previous series, of course, the nasty and somewhat back-stabbing French or the brutal Isralis). Of, and of course, ex-special forces from one country or another seem to creep out from under each stone to do some kind of horrible deed and intelligence officers seem to be capable to turn rogue just like that. In this series alone, we have ex-uk, ex-israeli, ex-Balkans (two or three of them, I can't remember). Here again, something that appeared in the first series has become a trend that has been so over-exploited that, to paraphrase ""Johnsie"", it can become ""bloody hilarious"" at times.

So, despite loving each episode and each series, including this one, I am afraid that it is better to put an end to it, regardless of who is to blame for the slippage in standards. Besides, the repeated use of the same tired tricks with just a few extra twists to make them ever more implausible was reaching a point where, even for a convicted fan like myself, it was getting a pit painfull to watch.

So, I hugely enjoyed this one, even if a bit less than the others and my only wish and my real regret is that the series is going out with a whimper, rather than with a bang...",1333411200,6,5660,4.646353646353647

4490211,5,B004X181VM,"Wow, what a finale to my favorite spy series of all time. MI-5/Spooks gave us 10 great years, 10 great seasons of edge of your seat drama/action with complex characters, and questionable ethics & behavior by the Agents all in the name of protecting the UK from its enemies. Season 10 focuses almost exclusively on Harry & Ruth the surviving members of MI-5 and together with a great background story of good & bad Russians, they bring the series to a climax rich and satisfying to those who have been hooked on MI-5 since the beginning like myself. Another viewer accurately warned, don't watch the special features 'Harry's Game' before watching the whole season or you will know the entire plot line--or do it like I did and watch the story with tremendous satisfaction anyway!

One thing about MI-5 that runs thru all 10 seasons and either turns you off--or makes you a die hard fan like I am; characters get killed off on a regular basis. You get so attached to the Agents, they're flawed, idealistic, naieve, heroic, and...they get killed! That's what makes the show SO great and compelling. The Agents aren't 'bulletproof' like in every other American cop/spy show. That simple fact makes you either love or hate the show and I loved it and will miss 'spooks'. Bravo to all the writers, actors and producers for giving us 86 episodes of rich television.",1332115200,,1359,4.734177215189874
4490212,5,B004X181VM,"I always considered MI-5 as one of the best. Season 10 brought this to near perfection. They managed to keep developing global plot across almost all episodes, nicely combining that with ""current emergencies"". The plot itself brings UK, US, Russia and that ""hint"" of another party into the mix, adds ""family issues"" and events of distant past to create excellent twists and surprises.

The only thing I did not like is that even this show bends the rules of what is currently technically possible (especially last episode) but I can forgive this for all the fun it brings.

Sad that it was the last season. In ""spy tv"" - I'm not aware of anything near that good...",1331856000,,664,4.666666666666667
4490213,5,B004X181VM,"In my opinion, this is the best of the last three seasons. Following the natural progression of MI-5/Spooks as a series constantly raising the bar, this last season has ascended to the heights and has appropriately been described by it's lead actor as a Greek tragedy in 6 acts.

Making lemonade out of budgetary lemons, it is a structurally complicated season. The over-all plot-arc evokes Cold War espionage tales; less action espionage and more psychological espionage. The threats-of-the-week, while reminiscent of series past, inform the plot on an allegorical level, to my mind much like a Greek chorus. In addition, references to art and literature add a symbolic level to the action if one is so inclined but is not essential to following the plot.

The combination of directors for this last season could not have been better chosen. Episodes 1 and 2 are directed by the expressionistic Alrick Riley. Episodes 3 and 4 by a more realistic Julian Holmes. Episodes 5 and 6 are left in the hands of the director responsible for establishing the over-all cinematographic tone of MI-5/Spooks, it's very first director, Bharat Nalurri, Mr. Nalurri's tone appropriately hits somewhere in the middle of the other two directors thus allowing the season as a whole to ""hang together"" so well.

As befits the last series, it revolves around the now iconic Sir Harry Pearce, magnificently portrayed by Peter Firth, and the personal cost to himself in the name of professional duty. Harking back to the days when Spooks was an ensemble piece there are many stellar performances in this series, beginning with the emotionally nuanced Nicola Walker, as the brilliant Ruth Evershed, in a career defining character and performance. Equally as brilliant, orbiting around them are Simon Russell Beale (politic William Towers), Alice Krige (elegant Elena Gavrik), Jonathan Hyde (ominous Ilya Gavrik), William Hope (enigmatic Jim Coaver) and Tom Weston Jones (troubled Sasha Gavrik.) Of the newer cast members, only Geoffrey Streatfield (audacious Calum Reid) and Shazad Latif (dedicated Tariq Masood) hold my attention.

This season is an appropriate end to the series as a whole. The only criticism I could give is that the last 10 minutes could have been handled with a bit more subtly, extended devolopment and care but once the symbolic bomb goes off and the hat is tipped to the history of MI-5/Spooks, it will not fail to affect viewers viscerally. Love or hate the choice the writers and producers have made regarding the end, I think that they have stayed true to the crux of what makes this show what it is - to it's heroically bitter conclusion.",1331683200,,2643,5.0411899313501145

I finally got the last 3 seasons. I like the series, the drama, the real characters.

I don't like the bang for the buck outcome. Season 8 and 9 have only 8 episodes each and season 10 has only 6. Yet they cost as much as other TV series that have 13 to 20 plus episodes. Even the last season of the series 24 (a half season) has more episodes.

I don't like the packaging for season 10. I could not slip the 2 dvd set inside the plastic slipcase out from the slip case. The slip case does not slip! Instead, I took a serrated blade knife and had to cut away the plastic ""slip case"" to get at the underlying dvd jacket.

I don't like the audio soundtrack NO options option. Season 10 only comes with Dolby Digital 2.0 - no Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 So, they charged me full throttle for only a 3rd of a season in episodes, 2 DVD package and season 10 only has 2.0 stereo. This 2 dvd set is at a premium price and only has a basic 2.0 Dolby soundtrack.

I don't like the fact that by now BBC should have released this older series (DVD only so far! No BluRay) as a 10 season box set and it is only available by buying individual seasons at a premium price. 10 seasons and there are not even 90 episodes overall.
