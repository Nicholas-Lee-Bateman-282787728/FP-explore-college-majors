8374514,4,B002N1AEXM,"This volume of Naruto features 4 episodes of Shippuden on 1 disc.  As detailed below are the episode titles and their associated chapters in the Naruto Manga.  Before we begin the disc features BOTH English subtitles BOTH English Audio and Japanese Audio.

Episode 14:  Naruto's Growth  (Scenes from Vol 29 Chapter 257,258,259)
Episode 15:  The Secret Weapon is Called... (Scenes from Vol 29 Chapter 258, 259, 260)
Episode 16:  The Secret of the Jinchuriki  (Scenes from Vol 29 Chapter 260, 261)
Episode 17:  The Death of Gaara  (Scenes from Vol 29 Chapter 261, 262)

Bonus features include trailers for Naruto Shippuden (once again, a trailer for Shippuden on the Shippuden disc?, oh well its nice to see a textless 'Heroes Comeback' Opening for it), Naruto Shippuden the Movie Trailer, Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Council 4(DS) Trailer, Bleach Movie 2: DiamondDust Rebellion trailer.  There is also the New from Viz Media area with an ad for Shonen Jump, Naruto manga, other Shonen Jump Manga, Shonen Jump Advanced Manga, information on the numerous places to download VIZ Media anime and to stream it. Yep thats it.

This is a great entry that concludes the fighting that was cut short in the last volume and brings us closer to the major fighting scenes in this arc of the manga (for those who read it) and plotline for those who just follow the anime.  I found that it was a really emotional episode and we continue to follow along with Naruto and experience his emotions in his quest to save Gaara. We also get to see Sakura finally get to understand why Naruto is so passionate and she begins to care more for him.

The ending theme is still Shooting Star by HomeMade Kokuzu and the opening is still Hero's Come Back by Nobodyknows+

Definitely a must buy for Naruto fans.",1262649600,2,1775,4.751633986928105
