2968457,5,B000WGVEAC,"I really enjoyed Kit Kittredge.  I thought the film was an important and interesting portrait of life in Cincinnati during the Great Depression.  As a Cincinnatian, I enjoyed seeing our city portrayed on the big screen and could relate to a lot of the local references.

The film was not the most fast-paced film I've ever seen, but it more than made up for it with its storyline.  This movie is at once a drama, mystery and historical fiction.  I walked away from the film still thinking about it, which is the sign of a good film to me.

The acting is terrific and includes acting giants and others I believe will be the acting giants of tomorrow.  This is not one to be missed.",1215648000,12,680,4.392
2968458,5,B000WGVEAC,"Compared to all of these crude 3-D animated movies,the repeated Super hero flicks, and the Rated R movies that have gone too far, there is finally a movie that is good without without the phony glitz and glamor! In fact, this movie teaches kids to be thankful for what they have and forget all of that nonsense. It is educational without being boring. It is interesting and has something for everybody in this movie. I recommend it for the whole family. You MUST go see this.",1215475200,17,475,4.534883720930233
2968459,4,B000WGVEAC,"""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" is certainly heartwarming and innocent, but that doesn't mean it's shallow and cloying. I admit that I thought it would be, mostly because I was expecting a virtual clone of last year's awful ""Nancy Drew."" There are certain similarities: both feature plucky young girls who do a lot of investigating; both have an assortment of colorful side characters; both are based on a series of stories, both feature Max Theroit. Unlike ""Nancy Drew,"" however, ""Kit Kittredge"" aims to tell a good story with real subtexts; taking place at the height of the Great Depression, we meet characters that are downtrodden and desperate, not only because their financial situations are bleak, but also because they face the scorn and rejection of ignorant people. This adaptation of stories drawn from the ""American Girl"" doll line mixes childish zeal with some very mature themes, and that alone made it worth seeing.

Abigail Breslin brings enthusiasm, charm, and heart to the title character, a ten-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio who runs a tree house club and dreams of becoming a newspaper reporter. She wants to write stories with fresh angles so that she can finally get into print. A pair of hobos--a helpful teenager named Will (Max Theroit) and his young friend, Countee (Willow Smith)--inspire Kit to write an article on hobo life. The fresh angle is that it will be told entirely from a kid's perspective, which may be needed in this case since many adults feel hobos are good-for-nothing leeches that suck the government dry. Kit has heard this rhetoric from her neighbors and classmates--one especially snotty young boy says that selling eggs and wearing dresses made of chicken feed bags bring you one step closer to the poorhouse.

But Kit is beginning to understand the hobos' plight, not only because many of her neighbors have lost their homes to foreclosures, but also because her unemployed father (Chris O'Donnell) is forced to find work all the way in Chicago. Hoping to make ends meet, Kit's mother (Julia Ormond) turns their home into a boarding house. This is how we meet: Ms. Dooley (Jane Krakowski), a husband-seeking dance instructor; the disapproving Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) and her young son, Sterling (Zach Mills); Ms. Bond (Joan Cusack), a slightly goofball mobile librarian; and Jefferson Burke (Stanley Tucci), a magician. When the subject of hobo robberies comes up, Mrs. Kittredge has everyone put their valuables in her lockbox. When it's stolen, everyone suspects Will as the culprit, including the police. Kit takes it upon herself to investigate. Despite what the evidence suggests, she believes her hobo friend is innocent.

It fairly obvious that ""Kit Kittredge"" is a commentary on prejudice; at one point in the film, Kit tells a cantankerous newspaper editor (Wallace Shawn) that there are good hobos and there are bad hobos, much like good apples and bad apples. She then gets a hard lesson in office politics when it's revealed that newspapers print only what the public wants to read, and the unfortunate truth is that the public is intolerant of hobos. Naturally, those who say this haven't met the people living in a hobo jungle, as Kit has; they're some of the nicest people around, and they willingly let Kit photograph them and write about them for her article. Messages of acceptance and understanding are not new, certainly not for a family film. But unlike a lot of other such stories, ""Kit Kittredge"" doesn't condescend, and when we leave, we feel both entertained and emotionally rejuvenated.

Aside from Kit, one of the film's best characters is Sterling, who at such a young age has already been beaten down by life. Sterling's father, much like Kit's, also left Cincinnati to find work, and communication with his family has steadily decreased. You see nothing but hurt and sadness in this boy's eyes. He and Kit are practically in the same boat, which is why they form a special bond. Kit is now worried that her father will forget her and her mother completely, even after promising to write them every single week. I remember a scene when Kit types a letter to her father; the frustration and fear she pours into the first draft makes for a heartbreaking moment.

I can't guarantee that adults will be as receptive to ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" as kids will, but I definitely recommend they give it a chance. The doll may be a hollow piece of plastic, but the character is something else entirely--she's kind, spirited, intelligent, and just plain wonderful. Some may criticize the film for being too sentimental, and indeed, it's light-hearted and optimistic, more than would be expected from a story set during the Depression. But it's more mature than it lets on. Even with a childish sense of humor, hopelessness and grief are not spared on the audience. It's always a pleasure to see a family film that was made with all audiences in mind, not just kids. ""Kit Kittredge"" is such a film, one of the most enjoyable I've seen all summer.",1215043200,77,5033,4.9374262101534825
2968460,5,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kitteridge: An American Girl is based on the best selling American Girl Kit Books authored by Valerie Tripp.
Kit's story begins in the 1930's during the Great Depression. Kit's father, Mr. Kitteridge, owns a car dealership. Her mother, Margaret is the director of the Ladies Garden Club. Kit's brother Charlie, is serving in the CCC, created by President Roosevelt. Kit aspires to become a newspaper reporter and to one day see herself in print with the Cinncinati Register. However due to the events of the Great Depression, Kit and her family's world is turned upside down. Mr. Kitteridge becomes unemployed after the bank forecloses on his car dealership. Due to the umployment situation in Cinncinati he travels to Chicago looking for work. Margaret Kitteridge along with Kit take on the responsibility of turning their large home into a boarding house. The boarders are an eclectic mix of individuals from different backgrounds. Stirling Howard, a classmate of Kit's and his mother Mrs. Howard, Miss Dooley, a dance instructor, Miss Bond, the local mobile librarian who can only stop the mobile library if she runs into something, Jefferson Berk, a magician who has a mystery of his own, and Fredrich, the boarder whose pet monkey is always keeping everyone on their toes. Kit and her mother also befriend Will and County, two young hobos who come to the Kitteridge home looking for work and a sense of family. Of course an American Girl story would not be complete without some excitement which comes in the form of a mystery for Kit and her friends to solve. This movie features a wonderful cast of character actors: Abigal Breslin as Kit, Chris O'Donnell as Mr. Kittredge, Julia Ormond as Margaret Kittredge, Jane Krakowski as Miss Dooley, Max Thieriot as Will Shepherd, Glenne Headley as Mrs. Howard, Joan Cusack as Miss Bond and Stanely Tucci as Jefferson Berk.",1215043200,25,1875,4.974522292993631

2968533,4,B000WGVEAC,"This film follows the formula that a lot American marketed at kids films do where the set, clothes and everything of characters including homeless and those working in gardens, kitchens and stuff is always very clean.  So it doesn't really show kids watching what hardship is like when poor if used as an educational historic tool in teaching about The Great Depression or anything like that.  Also like other American kids films it's pretty predictable and at no time do you feel Kit or any of the other kids are in danger, even though the storyline goes there.  But if you know all that going in and don't mind that, Kit Kitteredge: An American Girl is a pretty fun movie to watch.

The basic plot revolves around a young girl named Kit (played very well by a young Abigail Breslin), life is good as far as she knows for her family, her dad works as a car salesman, her mother hosts tea parties with the other wives in the backyard and she dreams of becoming a published journalist.  She's even written an article or two for the local paper, (only the editor won't publish them yet).  But we slowly start to see poverty start to raise its head at school, which is of course used as something to make fun of by certain kids at school.  One by one, a kid's parents' house is repossessed by the bank, some just disappear from school.  Upon a trip organised by a teacher to help out at the local soup kitchen Kit is embarrassed to find her dad NCIS LA's Chris O'Donnell) with a bowl of soup.  He'd lost his job and hadn't told her yet.  Soon ashamed he leaves for Chicago supposedly to find work.  As have a lot of other fathers, with their remaining families becoming borders at Kit's house so her mum  can continue with mortgage repayments, along with strangers such as mobile librarian and a magician.

Bates Motel's Max Thieriot plays a hobo kid who does odd jobs for Kit's mother in exchange for food.  Colin Mochrie (Who's Line is it Anyway) plays a hobo camp alpha male in this too.  In fact there's quite a few recognisable faces in this one.",1464912000,,2048,4.453083109919571

Family movie night has gotten hard lately because it is winter so we have it more often and I feel like we have run out of movies. When this came up as available I had remembered watching it but my daughter hadn't. She is 10 and said she liked it but I could tell that she didn't love it.

There is an air of a who done it in the story and it is cute while touching on how hard it was for people during the depression. This is the story of a confident little girl who will let nothing and no one keep her from becoming a journalist especially while she breaks a big story and manages to catch a criminal and clear the name of an innocent person at the same time. It is a great family movie especially if you have kids between 6-10, my 4 year old son wasn't interested in watching it all.

There is a lot a little girl can learn from Kit Kittredge and a lot adults can learn too and it spills into life today. It teaches you about not listening to stereotypes, standing up for what you believe in, not letting people get you down and learning who your true friends are.",1454457600,,1181,4.038461538461538

2968795,5,B000WGVEAC,"Engaging movie great for both children and adults!  Watched this with my almost- 4 yr. old daughter.  She had quite a few questions, and was very interested in the story.  It led to an age-appropriate discussion about saving money for necessities and not squandering it on too many unimportant ""wants"".  When it was over she wanted to watch it again!  Makes me want to read the book.",1434412800,,383,4.656716417910448
2968796,5,B000WGVEAC,"We've enjoyed watching this movie several times. It's one of the movies we watch pretty much each year.  It shows the financial struggles that a family goes through during the Great Depression, but the determination of each one of them helps them endure this difficult time in their lives.  Good story.",1434240000,,302,4.901960784313726
2968797,5,B000WGVEAC,"I really loved this movie! It is so difficult to find something decent without all the kid katiness /discouragement etc out there. My Husband and I preview shows/movies beforehand. The GOTY films fail so much, why are the historical films always better? I do hope they portray 9 year olds in a better light for future GOTY films. I want my 3 girls to have positive role models in film, encouraging charity, grace, confidence and humility when times get tough. It's not a lot to ask AG, make your girls and their friends soar with positive attitudes, not the frail wallflower that's depicted everywhere.",1434153600,,602,4.798076923076923

My daughter was interested in it because Kit is one of the American Girl dolls and it caught her attention.

2969005,5,B000WGVEAC,"I thought it was a very good movie of showing of how the times use to be in the recession era. Very interesting plot as the older movies used to play. Kids all played out good characters. Good family show,",1419379200,,205,4.15
2969006,5,B000WGVEAC,"My nine-year-old daughter loves reading historical fiction and some of the stories she has read featured the American Girls in various time periods in US history. She was predictably excited when she saw that there were several films based on some of these stories. Kit Kittredge An American Girl, much to my surprise, proved to be a well-scripted and well-cast film, and both my daughter and I found the film an engaging watch.
Abigail Breslin (who is maturing into a wonderfully talented young actress) plays the lead role as Kit Kittredge, an aspiring ten-year-old newspaper reporter. She lives in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is vivacious and intelligent. Life is rather hard in the Kittredge household as the time frame is that of the Great Depression. Many families have fallen on hard times, and Kits dad has left the family to seek a living elsewhere, hoping to make enough to provide for his family. In the meantime, Kits mom (played by Julia Ormond) takes in boarding guests into her home including a magician (played by Stanley Tucci). There are also a couple of young hobos who make Kits acquaintance.
When a series of burglaries occur, suspicion falls on the hobos, including Kits friend, and it is up to Kit and some of her other friends to prove their friends innocence. The story is set at a quick pace but not at the expense of the storyline. The film is also satisfactorily rich in period details including clothing and mannerisms particular to that time frame. This is wholesome family entertainment and my daughter and I found ourselves entertained. It also proved to be an educational experience for my daughter as we were able to discuss the Great Depression and its impact on the United States. Highly recommended.",1419379200,,1730,4.887755102040816

2969051,4,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kittredge-An American Girl, means that it is suitable fare for a viewer of any age.  There is nothing icky in this movie, there are no bad words, sexual situations or violence.  This often means that  a movie so designated has nothing interesting to say to those over the age of ten, see any Hanna Montana movie for conformation.
 Kit Kittredge however, is a very nice movie.  Kit is a ten year old girl caught up in the historic economic drama of the depression, circa 1934.  Her world is stretched to the very limit without coming completely apart.  The worlds of several of her classmates do come apart.  The real possibility of ultimate disaster provides the dramatic tension for the film.
 Abigail Breslin, the Sunshine in the wildly praised Little Miss Sunshine is back as Kit, the plucky heroine.  Her daddy advises her to not let it beat you, the it being whatever curve balls that life might throw at you.  Kit takes this advice to heart and is resolutely up beat, despite temptations to despair, through out the movie.  She also, like a young Nancy Drew, solves a crime and saves the family fortune.  Breslin is just wonderful as the brave little trooper.  I thought of Shirley Temple, who played plucky, optimistic little girls back in the real depression.
 There are a few quibbles with the script.  I doubt that race relations or class antagonisms were as gracefully managed in real life as the movie makes on.  But all in all, it is a enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy.  The acting is really first rate, with a great bunch of professional grownups backing up the kids.  Breslin is a real find.
  Julia Roberts is one of the producers.  Three enthusiastic saw blades for this one

2969213,5,B000WGVEAC,"I watched this movie with two little girls ages 7 and 9. They enjoyed it tremendously although some of the issues in the movie are better for children a little older. Basically, the movie covers issues around the Great Depression and people suddenly falling into poverty and the prejudice that they encounter. It is a great film to teach ethics around empathy, open-mindedness and compassion for your fellow human beings. There's a mystery in the film which involves a robbery and it's great fun. The heroine of the film has aspirations to be a journalist and her self-confidence was inspiring to my 9-year-old who is a bit shy.

My suggestion is that before the kids watch this film, you talk about the events surrounding the Great Depression and the effect it had on all kinds of people, rich and poor. Since the film talks about the hobos, it's a good idea to talk about the migrants of the Depression, why they had become homeless, the desperate straits they fell into, and the prejudice they faced.

Although some of the subject matter may seem heavy and depressing, the film is not at all depressing. It's actually quite uplifting and even funny at times. There was plenty to talk about after the film and the kids want to watch it again.

Mature elementary school students, both boys and girls, would enjoy this movie. It's both entertaining and educational, plus it includes lessons on honesty, compassion, patience and loyalty. Wish there were more films for kids like this.",1410307200,3,1483,4.807843137254902

2969427,4,B000WGVEAC,"This movie definitely surprised me. Looking at the cover, I figured it was like one of those ""Babysitters Club"" movies/books, but it was much more than that. Set in the depression, it follows Kit's family and their struggle with the economy. After her father loses his job when the local car deal shuts down, he heads off to Chicago, leaving Kit and her mom to open the family home as an Inn. An aspiring reporter, pre-teen Kit investigates a series of hobo crimes happening around the area that seem to lead to her new-found ""hobo"" friend. Eager to clear his name, Kit and her friends work together to solve the mystery.

Always eager to find movies that will appeal to both my wife and I and our three boys (age 9, 7,  and 3) - this movie fit the bill nicely. It had enough crime and intrigue to make it quasi-dangerous, yet was sweet enough and devoid of serious violence to be suitable for the youngsters. I definitely recommend this movie to families.",1404172800,,956,4.520231213872832

2969569,3,B000WGVEAC,"""Kit Kittredge"" began well, and I was impressed by the nice sense of period that the film invoked. Then, after about a half-hour or so, everything went awry, and I got too large a dosage of heavy-handed screenplay and direction. Let me hasten to say, however, that any shortcomings are not the fault of little Abigail Breslin, who is wonderful in the title role. Chris O'Donnell, who plays her father, is quite believable too, as is a nicely understated Max Thieriot in the role of young hobo Will Shepherd. On the debit side, Joan Cusack overacts by a wide margin as mobile librarian Miss Bond, and so does Wallace Shawn as newspaper editor Mr. Gibson. I suppose the main weakness, as so often happens in the motion picture industry, is the shallow script. It is way too manipulative and predictable. I could guess most all that might happen, with everything being tied up in a nice, comfy package by the final iris. Nope, that is not life, and it is also not effective storytelling. The ""bad guys"" are portrayed as buffoons, simply comic relief (complete with cartoonish music), and of course the downtrodden folks in the hobo community come little short of sainthood, one and all. If you want a truly great American Girl movie, go instead for ""Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front,"" which is outstanding in every respect.",1380844800,,1329,4.732758620689655

2969612,5,B000WGVEAC,This film is fantastic. It give a child's perspective to the Great Depression in the United States. The film is highly accurate depiction of the struggles of that time.

2969627,5,B000WGVEAC,"When my daughter came home from school saying ""You NEED to watch this movie - it's AWESOME!!!"" I was a little surprised.  She is not a really huge American Girl fan, and frankly I thought the whole suite of movies & shows surrounding the doll collection was a tad on the cheesy side.

Although I still think my overall view is probably accurate for the majority of the American Girl movies, I was REALLY impressed with this movie.  The story was well done, the budget fairly hefty, and the acting was actually quite good.  I was VERY surprised with how much I enjoyed the story, and this is a must see for ANY family consisting of at least 1 girl :-)",1371081600,,650,4.347107438016529

2969646,4,B000WGVEAC,"Saw this this week; decided to try it, not even sure I'd watch it.  I was very impressed.  You know that an American Girl movie is going to be as clean as a whistle (perhaps too much), but what surprised me was how good it was.  The supporting cast is first class.  Joan Cusack, the lending mobile librarian, is superb.  If you know her work, she uses every muscle in her face to milk every drop of humor from a scene.  I think she's as good as any of the classic film comedians both male and female.

The story was surprisingly good.  I even learned a little ""hobo"" sign language!  It kept reminding me of the Great Depression stories that my Dad told us when he was a kid living through it.  The hobos (really just wandering out of work men) marked the houses where they could get a meal; my grandmother's was one of them.  She also had boarders from that time until her death in the large beautiful home that her father built.  As small children, we were introduced to them, but they kept their distance from us (she was very much a Victorian lady.).  They were provided a room, linen service, and a bathroom, but not meals.  Even during her final illness, she insisted on keeping this up without help.

The last thing I remember is that (not in the film; just reverie)is that the speakeasies were also marked; a man and his son (my Dad) had to know where to get a drink!

Supposedly, the other films in this series are rated higher.  I will make a point of watching them.  The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I think this is very good but not one of the really great movies.  American Girl, you've done yourself proud.",1358467200,,1643,4.293159609120521

2969649,2,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kitterage was whiny and seeming a bit snotty. She overacted and just the way she looked at people in the movie was like ""I'm better than you."" She basically told the kid Sterling you have big ears which no one wants to hear. She just seemed like a brat and annoying how she was yelling at the guy at the news place. Abigall Breslin overacted and it wasn't a very good movie or a ""classic"" people make it out to be. Overall the movie was a flop.",1357516800,,448,4.1022727272727275

It takes place during the Great Depression, which was a great conversation opener (especially in our current economy) to discuss how people can lose jobs, therefore, lose their homes, etc.  Once the movie was over my daughter asked if WE could volunteer at a soup kitchen like Kit did.  The movie was sweet & engaging, but took place during a very serious time and dealt with a very serious topic that is very pertinent in our world.

2969708,5,B000WGVEAC,"Kitt Kitteredge (Abigale Breslin) plays Kit Kittridge, a girl about eight years old, growing up during the Great Depression.  Kit  is a upbeat and resourceful child with dreams of being a roving reporter.  She is constantly typing up stories and taking to the local newspaper in hopes of getting her stories printed.  It is 1934 and her parents are struggling to make ends meet.  Her father  loses his business overnight and it comes to a point that to save the family home, her mother takes in boarders and her father has to leave their home in Cincinnati to find work in Chicago.  Kit pitches in with the daily chores and continues writing articles as her escape.  She also writes her father and keeps a positive attitude.

As Kit helps with the daily chores, writes her articles and letters to dad, her mother's money for the mortgage is stolen along a few of the boarder's valuables.  A good mystery transpires that Kit and her friends help solve.

""Kit Kittridge: An American Girl"" was released in 2008 and gives a interesting look at a time most often have long forgotten.  The story keeps moving and held my interest while being told from Kit's perspective.  The cinematography along with the 1930's cars, homes, clothes were unusually good.

The movie is refreshingly sweet, appealing and sincere.  In my opinion, it should please all audiences, though geared to the young teen girl.",1284249600,,1391,4.810126582278481

We were greatly disappointed - all people from my family including my 9 years old daughter. We were hoping that the movie would tell more or less a real story of the big depression - so similar to the great recession which we have now (2010). The beginning was good. It showed Kit's family and her friends experiencing the signs of depression and dealing with it. It showed the school and kids trying to aprehend what it is about.

The plot of stealing the money and jewelry, the magician, monkey man and the librarian become such a farce that all the other aspects of movie are completely lost. This gives a very bad impression on the rest of the film. The bad comedy at the end spoils it all!",1265241600,2,802,4.382550335570469

While taking in borders to pay their mortgage she befriends and helps some homeless boys who need work.  Kit gets to use her reporting skills as a mystery unfolds.  Someone stole their mortgage money and now they are facing forclosure.  All the evidence points to her homeless friend, but Kit is determined to find the truth.

Great for the whole family.  My boys enjoy the story as well. Great acting by Breslin. The guest stars Joan Cusack,Stanley Tucci,Chris O'Donnell, Wallace Shawn, and Max Thierot definitely bring this to life.",1265155200,2,814,4.683098591549296

This is a great movie that includes things like ""hoboes"" and foreclosures.  Ironically, this is a GREAT movie about some of the things that kids are dealing with in 2009/2010.

It talks about soup kitchens, jumping trains, and even saving left-overs.  Kit is a real trouper and deals with the depression era really well considering all that she goes through.  It talks about important things like the CCC which was an important part of history.

Her father eventually loses his job and moves to try to find work. Her and her mother take in borders, sell eggs and do everything they can do to make it through the difficult times.

Kit deals with each difficulty with grace and strength and honesty. She works on writing newsletter articles during this time and eventually gets one published. She also befriends some hobos and learns about their life as well.

This movie is fascinating, interesting and heart warming. It is also heart breaking to watch this young girl learning to deal with such difficult circumstances.

Well worth the money.

The boys groaned when I told them it was an ""American Girl"" movie, but when the movie was over Kit Kittredge had won the attention and emotions of the 13 boys and 5 girls in the classroom.

The movie, although set in Depression times in Cincinnatti,Ohio, is overall very positive and encouraging.  Kit and her mother get creative in order to make ends meet and prevent foreclosure on their home.  A emotionally-wrenching situation with Kit's father losing his job and having to move to Chicago resolves in the end.  The neatest thing, in my opinion, is Kit (although young) is a writer and aspired to one day ""see her name in print.""  The quick-witted Kit quickly learns that persistence, practice, patience and a creative ""angle"" were necessary for her ""reporting"" to get from her typewriter to newspaper print!",1238803200,,917,4.883870967741935

It also has a great cast of actors so I sat down to enjoy it with them.  The main plot itself was nice; basically a lesson of not judging a book by its cover.
However, riddled throughout the movie is this message that's drilled at you over and over again that: rich people are selfish; rich people are evil; rich people are mean and nasty.  Adding weight to the ""rich people are evil"" motif, is another display, in a long line of twisted takes on the story of Robin Hood, simplifying the character of Robin Hood to that of someone that steals from the rich and gives to the poor.  When actually, the important detail of the story of Robin Hood is his motive: he steals the people's taxes back from a tyrannical government that is overtaxing the people.  But anyway, it's just unfortunate that the creators of this movie (ironically enough, rich people) saw fit to ruin what might have been a good family movie by peppering it with their ridiculous propaganda.",1232496000,13,1121,4.613065326633166

I initially saw it in the theater with my two daughters not expecting much.  I was wrong!  It's a Nancy Drew-style mystery movie, with a first rate all-star cast.

2969934,2,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kittredge American girl is about a young girl who aspires to be a reporter while growing up during the depression. The American Girl series is a wholesome series, featuring girls from different walks of life and backgrounds who face challenges and overcome them using ther brains, their friendships and common sense.

I felt Kit Kittredge wasn't my favorite story and was actually a bit boring. Kit and her friends were nice, but lacked that spark that made them loveable (Like Samantha) and were a bit wooden. This was the Depression, and yet, Kit and her mother were fairly well off. They could've done a bit more to illustrate how hard times were for this family specifically. True, they took in boarders, but overall they were better off and better groomed than most.

The subplot involving the robbery was a bit silly and the hobos.. Eh. Took up most of the story. Children might enjoy Kit Kittredge, but I found the acting a bit wooden, and the hobo's and their story overwhelmed Kit's a bit, there just wasn't spark in this story to capture my interest.",1230508800,6,1064,4.71505376344086
2969935,3,B000WGVEAC,"This is a good movie for families, and if you have a young girl in your family that likes the American Girl series, she will enjoy it especially. Abigail Breslin nails a performance that carries the movie, and the look and feel of the movie evokes the time period well. As such, this will most likely get multiple viewings in your house and it's just marginally worth purchasing.

The theatrical aspect ratio of this movie was 1.85:1 and this release has the picture cropped down to a widescreen-TV-matching aspect ratio of 1.78:1. While that only represents less than a 4% loss of picture composition (unless it was open-matted to gain extra height from the original negative), I'd prefer it if movie studios didn't modify the composition of their movies on Blu-ray or DVD.

Even though there are trailers for other American Girl movies, there is no trailer for the movie on the disc. I wish that more studios would do this, as it provides a way to see how the movie was marketed at the time and it's something that should be easy to include.

Normally, I'd like to see more extras on a disc to make it worth purchasing. Such extras reward those who choose to purchase instead of rent and it allows them to get more enjoyment from the title that goes past just watching the movie.

If you can get it at a good price, this DVD is worth purchasing if you have an American Girl fan in your house.",1230508800,3,1394,4.4980237154150196

Unfortunately, my ""antique"" computer doesn't have a DVD drive. I do expect I'll thoroughly enjoy the movie when I finally see it.

2969972,5,B000WGVEAC,"I missed the ""Kit Kittredge - An American Girl"" film when it was shown in movie theaters a few months ago, but I snapped up the DVD at first sight. Movie critics and reviewers had said it was excellent. It was! It was a wonderful period movie that will bear watching again and again. My wife said it was a story for children, and I suppose that's true, but it's much, much more. The movie is set in 1934, the heart of the Great Depression. Well, I was born about that time and I don't remember much before 1940, but the folks and our relatives always had a lot of tales of those days and, for us, much of the 40s were not all that different .

The movie is just wonderfully done. All the 30s and earlier cars on the streets were just amazing. The wonderful neighborhood scenes seemed so authentic. The people and their acting and appearance all appeared completely authentic. The 30s music was completely appropriate. Everything seemed so authentic and believable that you might simply relax and be transported back to relive that era. The period depiction, in itself, should bring an Oscar nomination.

The acting was excellent. All of the characters seemed believable and fit the 30s scene ideally. The kids, in particular, were outstanding for depicting kids of that era. Surely, the director will receive an Oscar nomination. A little story of Kit Kitterage serving as a writer and amateur detective kept the interest and might be the highlight of the movie for children. For me, the whole movie was achingly sad and painful. I felt so sorry for the people caught up in the ever increasing economic blight and I wondered if we might not be sliding into another such situation.

Abigail Breslin was particularly outstanding. I fell in love with her in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and her role in this movie was just as good, if not better. This young lady is a rising star, without question. She should get an Oscar nomination for this performance. But, of course, she had such an excellent supporting cast and that really made her stand out.

This is an outstanding movie from a variety of viewpoints. First rate!

As the movie opens, we see unfortunate neighbors with foreclosure signs in their yards, belongings being seized, and soup kitchens. Kit's situation goes from comfortable to pinched overnight; the bank seizes the dealership, her father moves to Chicago to look for work, and her mother must take in boarders to make ends meet.  From there, it's only a short step to selling eggs, and then the poorhouse.

Kit's generally optimistic outlook is nearly crushed under this avalanche of adult responsibilities, but her father gently tells her not to let it beat her before he leaves to look for work. Kit throws herself into her writing, penning a kid's eye view of the Depression as she volunteers at soup kitchens and befriends two young hobos, Will and Countee (Max Thieriot, who played Nancy Drew's boyfriend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew/dp/B00005JPO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew</a>, and Willow Smith).

The new boarders are the subject of many of her articles. There's magician Mr. Berk (Stanley Tucci), mobile librarian Ms. Bond (Joan Cusack), Mrs. Howard and her son Stirling, and the exotic dance instructor Miss Dooley.

But danger strikes  as a series of robberies perpetrated by hobos sweeps the nation, and Will and Countee find themselves unwelcome, especially after Will is implicated in two robberies that hit close to home. Kit and her friends Ruthie and Stirling set out to solve the mystery of who would frame Will.

The film does a wonderful job at capturing 1930s atmosphere, particularly in the soundtrack department.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kit-Kittredge-An-American-Girl-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0017V7HB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kit Kittredge: An American Girl - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;contains two fabulous tracks by the Puppini Sisters (retro 1940s-style vocal harmonies), Ain't We Got Fun by retro songbird Renee Olstead, and vintage tracks by Spike Jones, Billie Holiday, Cliff Edwards, and Xavier Cugat.

Kit Kittredge is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.  The story (and I haven't read the book series that it's based on) is a gently old-fashioned tale of respect, altruism, and optimism in the face of difficulty that will resonate with parents, and kids will enjoy the blend of magic shows, funny characters, and mystery.  The solid acting from the big-name cast, headlined by Abigail, offers up a sanitized but effective overview of the atmosphere of the Great Depression, particularly salient as our nation once again finds itself in a sea of foreclosures, high unemployment, and the threat of recession if not depression.",1226361600,2,3813,6.551587301587301

2970005,4,B000WGVEAC,"What a refreshing change!  In a world of increasingly violent, filthy, and vulgar movies, Kitt Kittredge stands tall and proud.  In essence, this is a solid story with a splendid cast.
The story revolves around its title character, Kitt (Abigail Breslin), a plucky eleven-year-old who deals with peer pressure, drastic changes in her life-style, rejection, etc., etc.
The movie flows well and has a relatively plausible story-line, which at times prompts audible laughter from the audience.  There is a serious side,too, including threats (laughable though they may be) against the children and a visit to a hobo ""jungle,"" or camp.  I appreciated how they portrayed the hoboes as honest people who were down on their luck.  Kitt puts it quite well.
The movie is full of talented young actors and actresses - Max Thieriot, from Nancy Drew and Zach Mills, from Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium; as well as pleasantly familiar faces such as Julia Ormond and Chris O'Donnell.  And that's just dropping a few names; you'll recognize at least three other faces.",1224806400,4,1053,5.093023255813954

To my sheer astonishment, KIT KITTREDGE: AN AMERICAN GIRL is a throwback to those great films, entertaining, absorbing, and for adults as well as children. Abigail Breslin doesn't play Kit, she IS Kit, from her bobbed hair to her scuffed Mary Janes: resourceful, clever, imaginative. Even if the final chase of the movie does get a little slapstick, everything else clicks in this grand film. Zach Mills is stunning as Stirling, one of the boarders taken in at the Kittredge home after Kit's dad loses his job, a boy who has had to face the hard facts of life earlier than expected, and there are two marvelous supporting character performances from Colin Mochrie as one of the denizens of the hobo jungle and Wallace Shawn as the newspaper editor Kit tries to win over.

3202956,4,B000WGVEAC,"""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" is certainly heartwarming and innocent, but that doesn't mean it's shallow and cloying. I admit that I thought it would be, mostly because I was expecting a virtual clone of last year's awful ""Nancy Drew."" There are certain similarities: both feature plucky young girls who do a lot of investigating; both have an assortment of colorful side characters; both are based on a series of stories, both feature Max Theroit. Unlike ""Nancy Drew,"" however, ""Kit Kittredge"" aims to tell a good story with real subtexts; taking place at the height of the Great Depression, we meet characters that are downtrodden and desperate, not only because their financial situations are bleak, but also because they face the scorn and rejection of ignorant people. This adaptation of stories drawn from the ""American Girl"" doll line mixes childish zeal with some very mature themes, and that alone made it worth seeing.

Abigail Breslin brings enthusiasm, charm, and heart to the title character, a ten-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio who runs a tree house club and dreams of becoming a newspaper reporter. She wants to write stories with fresh angles so that she can finally get into print. A pair of hobos--a helpful teenager named Will (Max Theroit) and his young friend, Countee (Willow Smith)--inspire Kit to write an article on hobo life. The fresh angle is that it will be told entirely from a kid's perspective, which may be needed in this case since many adults feel hobos are good-for-nothing leeches that suck the government dry. Kit has heard this rhetoric from her neighbors and classmates--one especially snotty young boy says that selling eggs and wearing dresses made of chicken feed bags bring you one step closer to the poorhouse.

But Kit is beginning to understand the hobos' plight, not only because many of her neighbors have lost their homes to foreclosures, but also because her unemployed father (Chris O'Donnell) is forced to find work all the way in Chicago. Hoping to make ends meet, Kit's mother (Julia Ormond) turns their home into a boarding house. This is how we meet: Ms. Dooley (Jane Krakowski), a husband-seeking dance instructor; the disapproving Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) and her young son, Sterling (Zach Mills); Ms. Bond (Joan Cusack), a slightly goofball mobile librarian; and Jefferson Burke (Stanley Tucci), a magician. When the subject of hobo robberies comes up, Mrs. Kittredge has everyone put their valuables in her lockbox. When it's stolen, everyone suspects Will as the culprit, including the police. Kit takes it upon herself to investigate. Despite what the evidence suggests, she believes her hobo friend is innocent.

It fairly obvious that ""Kit Kittredge"" is a commentary on prejudice; at one point in the film, Kit tells a cantankerous newspaper editor (Wallace Shawn) that there are good hobos and there are bad hobos, much like good apples and bad apples. She then gets a hard lesson in office politics when it's revealed that newspapers print only what the public wants to read, and the unfortunate truth is that the public is intolerant of hobos. Naturally, those who say this haven't met the people living in a hobo jungle, as Kit has; they're some of the nicest people around, and they willingly let Kit photograph them and write about them for her article. Messages of acceptance and understanding are not new, certainly not for a family film. But unlike a lot of other such stories, ""Kit Kittredge"" doesn't condescend, and when we leave, we feel both entertained and emotionally rejuvenated.

Aside from Kit, one of the film's best characters is Sterling, who at such a young age has already been beaten down by life. Sterling's father, much like Kit's, also left Cincinnati to find work, and communication with his family has steadily decreased. You see nothing but hurt and sadness in this boy's eyes. He and Kit are practically in the same boat, which is why they form a special bond. Kit is now worried that her father will forget her and her mother completely, even after promising to write them every single week. I remember a scene when Kit types a letter to her father; the frustration and fear she pours into the first draft makes for a heartbreaking moment.

I can't guarantee that adults will be as receptive to ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" as kids will, but I definitely recommend they give it a chance. The doll may be a hollow piece of plastic, but the character is something else entirely--she's kind, spirited, intelligent, and just plain wonderful. Some may criticize the film for being too sentimental, and indeed, it's light-hearted and optimistic, more than would be expected from a story set during the Depression. But it's more mature than it lets on. Even with a childish sense of humor, hopelessness and grief are not spared on the audience. It's always a pleasure to see a family film that was made with all audiences in mind, not just kids. ""Kit Kittredge"" is such a film, one of the most enjoyable I've seen all summer.",1215043200,77,5033,4.9374262101534825
3202957,5,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kitteridge: An American Girl is based on the best selling American Girl Kit Books authored by Valerie Tripp.
Kit's story begins in the 1930's during the Great Depression. Kit's father, Mr. Kitteridge, owns a car dealership. Her mother, Margaret is the director of the Ladies Garden Club. Kit's brother Charlie, is serving in the CCC, created by President Roosevelt. Kit aspires to become a newspaper reporter and to one day see herself in print with the Cinncinati Register. However due to the events of the Great Depression, Kit and her family's world is turned upside down. Mr. Kitteridge becomes unemployed after the bank forecloses on his car dealership. Due to the umployment situation in Cinncinati he travels to Chicago looking for work. Margaret Kitteridge along with Kit take on the responsibility of turning their large home into a boarding house. The boarders are an eclectic mix of individuals from different backgrounds. Stirling Howard, a classmate of Kit's and his mother Mrs. Howard, Miss Dooley, a dance instructor, Miss Bond, the local mobile librarian who can only stop the mobile library if she runs into something, Jefferson Berk, a magician who has a mystery of his own, and Fredrich, the boarder whose pet monkey is always keeping everyone on their toes. Kit and her mother also befriend Will and County, two young hobos who come to the Kitteridge home looking for work and a sense of family. Of course an American Girl story would not be complete without some excitement which comes in the form of a mystery for Kit and her friends to solve. This movie features a wonderful cast of character actors: Abigal Breslin as Kit, Chris O'Donnell as Mr. Kittredge, Julia Ormond as Margaret Kittredge, Jane Krakowski as Miss Dooley, Max Thieriot as Will Shepherd, Glenne Headley as Mrs. Howard, Joan Cusack as Miss Bond and Stanely Tucci as Jefferson Berk.",1215043200,25,1875,4.974522292993631

3203030,4,B000WGVEAC,"This film follows the formula that a lot American marketed at kids films do where the set, clothes and everything of characters including homeless and those working in gardens, kitchens and stuff is always very clean.  So it doesn't really show kids watching what hardship is like when poor if used as an educational historic tool in teaching about The Great Depression or anything like that.  Also like other American kids films it's pretty predictable and at no time do you feel Kit or any of the other kids are in danger, even though the storyline goes there.  But if you know all that going in and don't mind that, Kit Kitteredge: An American Girl is a pretty fun movie to watch.

The basic plot revolves around a young girl named Kit (played very well by a young Abigail Breslin), life is good as far as she knows for her family, her dad works as a car salesman, her mother hosts tea parties with the other wives in the backyard and she dreams of becoming a published journalist.  She's even written an article or two for the local paper, (only the editor won't publish them yet).  But we slowly start to see poverty start to raise its head at school, which is of course used as something to make fun of by certain kids at school.  One by one, a kid's parents' house is repossessed by the bank, some just disappear from school.  Upon a trip organised by a teacher to help out at the local soup kitchen Kit is embarrassed to find her dad NCIS LA's Chris O'Donnell) with a bowl of soup.  He'd lost his job and hadn't told her yet.  Soon ashamed he leaves for Chicago supposedly to find work.  As have a lot of other fathers, with their remaining families becoming borders at Kit's house so her mum  can continue with mortgage repayments, along with strangers such as mobile librarian and a magician.

Bates Motel's Max Thieriot plays a hobo kid who does odd jobs for Kit's mother in exchange for food.  Colin Mochrie (Who's Line is it Anyway) plays a hobo camp alpha male in this too.  In fact there's quite a few recognisable faces in this one.",1464912000,,2048,4.453083109919571

Wonderful to use in U.S. history class for 4-8 grades.  I used in a High School Life Skills class after we studied the Great Depression in U.S. History class.

3203056,4,B000WGVEAC,"I personally have liked this movie for a long time but it could be that mainly I like the history of the story.

Family movie night has gotten hard lately because it is winter so we have it more often and I feel like we have run out of movies. When this came up as available I had remembered watching it but my daughter hadn't. She is 10 and said she liked it but I could tell that she didn't love it.

There is an air of a who done it in the story and it is cute while touching on how hard it was for people during the depression. This is the story of a confident little girl who will let nothing and no one keep her from becoming a journalist especially while she breaks a big story and manages to catch a criminal and clear the name of an innocent person at the same time. It is a great family movie especially if you have kids between 6-10, my 4 year old son wasn't interested in watching it all.

There is a lot a little girl can learn from Kit Kittredge and a lot adults can learn too and it spills into life today. It teaches you about not listening to stereotypes, standing up for what you believe in, not letting people get you down and learning who your true friends are.",1454457600,,1181,4.038461538461538

Our children can relate to the children in this movie and have feelings about what they went through instead of just head knowledge.  I am a teacher, mother of four, and grandmother of 10, and would recommend this for all ages.

3203502,5,B000WGVEAC,"I thought it was a very good movie of showing of how the times use to be in the recession era. Very interesting plot as the older movies used to play. Kids all played out good characters. Good family show,",1419379200,,205,4.15
3203503,5,B000WGVEAC,"My nine-year-old daughter loves reading historical fiction and some of the stories she has read featured the American Girls in various time periods in US history. She was predictably excited when she saw that there were several films based on some of these stories. Kit Kittredge An American Girl, much to my surprise, proved to be a well-scripted and well-cast film, and both my daughter and I found the film an engaging watch.
Abigail Breslin (who is maturing into a wonderfully talented young actress) plays the lead role as Kit Kittredge, an aspiring ten-year-old newspaper reporter. She lives in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is vivacious and intelligent. Life is rather hard in the Kittredge household as the time frame is that of the Great Depression. Many families have fallen on hard times, and Kits dad has left the family to seek a living elsewhere, hoping to make enough to provide for his family. In the meantime, Kits mom (played by Julia Ormond) takes in boarding guests into her home including a magician (played by Stanley Tucci). There are also a couple of young hobos who make Kits acquaintance.
When a series of burglaries occur, suspicion falls on the hobos, including Kits friend, and it is up to Kit and some of her other friends to prove their friends innocence. The story is set at a quick pace but not at the expense of the storyline. The film is also satisfactorily rich in period details including clothing and mannerisms particular to that time frame. This is wholesome family entertainment and my daughter and I found ourselves entertained. It also proved to be an educational experience for my daughter as we were able to discuss the Great Depression and its impact on the United States. Highly recommended.",1419379200,,1730,4.887755102040816

3203548,4,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kittredge-An American Girl, means that it is suitable fare for a viewer of any age.  There is nothing icky in this movie, there are no bad words, sexual situations or violence.  This often means that  a movie so designated has nothing interesting to say to those over the age of ten, see any Hanna Montana movie for conformation.
 Kit Kittredge however, is a very nice movie.  Kit is a ten year old girl caught up in the historic economic drama of the depression, circa 1934.  Her world is stretched to the very limit without coming completely apart.  The worlds of several of her classmates do come apart.  The real possibility of ultimate disaster provides the dramatic tension for the film.
 Abigail Breslin, the Sunshine in the wildly praised Little Miss Sunshine is back as Kit, the plucky heroine.  Her daddy advises her to not let it beat you, the it being whatever curve balls that life might throw at you.  Kit takes this advice to heart and is resolutely up beat, despite temptations to despair, through out the movie.  She also, like a young Nancy Drew, solves a crime and saves the family fortune.  Breslin is just wonderful as the brave little trooper.  I thought of Shirley Temple, who played plucky, optimistic little girls back in the real depression.
 There are a few quibbles with the script.  I doubt that race relations or class antagonisms were as gracefully managed in real life as the movie makes on.  But all in all, it is a enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy.  The acting is really first rate, with a great bunch of professional grownups backing up the kids.  Breslin is a real find.
  Julia Roberts is one of the producers.  Three enthusiastic saw blades for this one

3203710,5,B000WGVEAC,"I watched this movie with two little girls ages 7 and 9. They enjoyed it tremendously although some of the issues in the movie are better for children a little older. Basically, the movie covers issues around the Great Depression and people suddenly falling into poverty and the prejudice that they encounter. It is a great film to teach ethics around empathy, open-mindedness and compassion for your fellow human beings. There's a mystery in the film which involves a robbery and it's great fun. The heroine of the film has aspirations to be a journalist and her self-confidence was inspiring to my 9-year-old who is a bit shy.

My suggestion is that before the kids watch this film, you talk about the events surrounding the Great Depression and the effect it had on all kinds of people, rich and poor. Since the film talks about the hobos, it's a good idea to talk about the migrants of the Depression, why they had become homeless, the desperate straits they fell into, and the prejudice they faced.

Although some of the subject matter may seem heavy and depressing, the film is not at all depressing. It's actually quite uplifting and even funny at times. There was plenty to talk about after the film and the kids want to watch it again.

Mature elementary school students, both boys and girls, would enjoy this movie. It's both entertaining and educational, plus it includes lessons on honesty, compassion, patience and loyalty. Wish there were more films for kids like this.",1410307200,3,1483,4.807843137254902

3203844,5,B000WGVEAC,"Both the poster and the title made me really hesitate to watch the movie. It promised a too sweet, too simple and too predictable movie for my taste buds. But I took the risk and I'm so happy: a great story, memorable characters, some fantastic acting and true freshness. That last thing stunned me, I have to admit. It's the last thing I'd expect in a kid movie from 1998. It's not just another product for kids and families. Oh no, there is the style, the heart and feelings of joy and sadness that really grip you.

It's one of those few movies that you can't neither be too young or too old to watch.

It is an interesting look into a very difficult time in this country and seems like a fairly accurate portrayal of what it may have been like for some upper middle class families struggling to stay afloat well into the depression.  There were many well know names in this movie and the acting was very good.  I found Abigail Breslin, Chris O'Donnell and Julia Ormond particularly endearing.

3203924,4,B000WGVEAC,"This movie definitely surprised me. Looking at the cover, I figured it was like one of those ""Babysitters Club"" movies/books, but it was much more than that. Set in the depression, it follows Kit's family and their struggle with the economy. After her father loses his job when the local car deal shuts down, he heads off to Chicago, leaving Kit and her mom to open the family home as an Inn. An aspiring reporter, pre-teen Kit investigates a series of hobo crimes happening around the area that seem to lead to her new-found ""hobo"" friend. Eager to clear his name, Kit and her friends work together to solve the mystery.

Always eager to find movies that will appeal to both my wife and I and our three boys (age 9, 7,  and 3) - this movie fit the bill nicely. It had enough crime and intrigue to make it quasi-dangerous, yet was sweet enough and devoid of serious violence to be suitable for the youngsters.

3204066,3,B000WGVEAC,"""Kit Kittredge"" began well, and I was impressed by the nice sense of period that the film invoked. Then, after about a half-hour or so, everything went awry, and I got too large a dosage of heavy-handed screenplay and direction. Let me hasten to say, however, that any shortcomings are not the fault of little Abigail Breslin, who is wonderful in the title role. Chris O'Donnell, who plays her father, is quite believable too, as is a nicely understated Max Thieriot in the role of young hobo Will Shepherd. On the debit side, Joan Cusack overacts by a wide margin as mobile librarian Miss Bond, and so does Wallace Shawn as newspaper editor Mr. Gibson. I suppose the main weakness, as so often happens in the motion picture industry, is the shallow script. It is way too manipulative and predictable. I could guess most all that might happen, with everything being tied up in a nice, comfy package by the final iris. Nope, that is not life, and it is also not effective storytelling. The ""bad guys"" are portrayed as buffoons, simply comic relief (complete with cartoonish music), and of course the downtrodden folks in the hobo community come little short of sainthood, one and all. If you want a truly great American Girl movie, go instead for ""Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front,"" which is outstanding in every respect.",1380844800,,1329,4.732758620689655

She is not a really huge American Girl fan, and frankly I thought the whole suite of movies & shows surrounding the doll collection was a tad on the cheesy side.

Although I still think my overall view is probably accurate for the majority of the American Girl movies, I was REALLY impressed with this movie.  The story was well done, the budget fairly hefty, and the acting was actually quite good.

3204143,4,B000WGVEAC,"Saw this this week; decided to try it, not even sure I'd watch it.  I was very impressed.  You know that an American Girl movie is going to be as clean as a whistle (perhaps too much), but what surprised me was how good it was.  The supporting cast is first class.  Joan Cusack, the lending mobile librarian, is superb.  If you know her work, she uses every muscle in her face to milk every drop of humor from a scene.  I think she's as good as any of the classic film comedians both male and female.

The story was surprisingly good.  I even learned a little ""hobo"" sign language!  It kept reminding me of the Great Depression stories that my Dad told us when he was a kid living through it.  The hobos (really just wandering out of work men) marked the houses where they could get a meal; my grandmother's was one of them.  She also had boarders from that time until her death in the large beautiful home that her father built.  As small children, we were introduced to them, but they kept their distance from us (she was very much a Victorian lady.).  They were provided a room, linen service, and a bathroom, but not meals.  Even during her final illness, she insisted on keeping this up without help.

The last thing I remember is that (not in the film; just reverie)is that the speakeasies were also marked; a man and his son (my Dad) had to know where to get a drink!

Supposedly, the other films in this series are rated higher.  I will make a point of watching them.  The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I think this is very good but not one of the really great movies.  American Girl, you've done yourself proud.",1358467200,,1643,4.293159609120521

3204146,2,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kitterage was whiny and seeming a bit snotty. She overacted and just the way she looked at people in the movie was like ""I'm better than you."" She basically told the kid Sterling you have big ears which no one wants to hear. She just seemed like a brat and annoying how she was yelling at the guy at the news place. Abigall Breslin overacted and it wasn't a very good movie or a ""classic"" people make it out to be. Overall the movie was a flop.",1357516800,,448,4.1022727272727275

She received Kit & the movie for Christmas.  We just watched the movie. It takes place during the Great Depression, which was a great conversation opener (especially in our current economy) to discuss how people can lose jobs, therefore, lose their homes, etc.  Once the movie was over my daughter asked if WE could volunteer at a soup kitchen like Kit did.  The movie was sweet & engaging, but took place during a very serious time and dealt with a very serious topic that is very pertinent in our world.

3204205,5,B000WGVEAC,"Kitt Kitteredge (Abigale Breslin) plays Kit Kittridge, a girl about eight years old, growing up during the Great Depression.  Kit  is a upbeat and resourceful child with dreams of being a roving reporter.  She is constantly typing up stories and taking to the local newspaper in hopes of getting her stories printed.  It is 1934 and her parents are struggling to make ends meet.  Her father  loses his business overnight and it comes to a point that to save the family home, her mother takes in boarders and her father has to leave their home in Cincinnati to find work in Chicago.  Kit pitches in with the daily chores and continues writing articles as her escape.  She also writes her father and keeps a positive attitude.

As Kit helps with the daily chores, writes her articles and letters to dad, her mother's money for the mortgage is stolen along a few of the boarder's valuables.  A good mystery transpires that Kit and her friends help solve.

""Kit Kittridge: An American Girl"" was released in 2008 and gives a interesting look at a time most often have long forgotten.  The story keeps moving and held my interest while being told from Kit's perspective.  The cinematography along with the 1930's cars, homes, clothes were unusually good.

The movie is refreshingly sweet, appealing and sincere.  In my opinion, it should please all audiences, though geared to the young teen girl.",1284249600,,1391,4.810126582278481

We were greatly disappointed - all people from my family including my 9 years old daughter. We were hoping that the movie would tell more or less a real story of the big depression - so similar to the great recession which we have now (2010). The beginning was good. It showed Kit's family and her friends experiencing the signs of depression and dealing with it. It showed the school and kids trying to aprehend what it is about.

The plot of stealing the money and jewelry, the magician, monkey man and the librarian become such a farce that all the other aspects of movie are completely lost. This gives a very bad impression on the rest of the film. The bad comedy at the end spoils it all!",1265241600,2,802,4.382550335570469

While taking in borders to pay their mortgage she befriends and helps some homeless boys who need work.  Kit gets to use her reporting skills as a mystery unfolds.  Someone stole their mortgage money and now they are facing forclosure.  All the evidence points to her homeless friend, but Kit is determined to find the truth.

Great for the whole family.  My boys enjoy the story as well. Great acting by Breslin. The guest stars Joan Cusack,Stanley Tucci,Chris O'Donnell, Wallace Shawn, and Max Thierot definitely bring this to life.",1265155200,2,814,4.683098591549296

This is a great movie that includes things like ""hoboes"" and foreclosures.  Ironically, this is a GREAT movie about some of the things that kids are dealing with in 2009/2010.

It talks about soup kitchens, jumping trains, and even saving left-overs.  Kit is a real trouper and deals with the depression era really well considering all that she goes through.  It talks about important things like the CCC which was an important part of history.

The boys groaned when I told them it was an ""American Girl"" movie, but when the movie was over Kit Kittredge had won the attention and emotions of the 13 boys and 5 girls in the classroom.

The movie, although set in Depression times in Cincinnatti,Ohio, is overall very positive and encouraging.  Kit and her mother get creative in order to make ends meet and prevent foreclosure on their home.  A emotionally-wrenching situation with Kit's father losing his job and having to move to Chicago resolves in the end.  The neatest thing, in my opinion, is Kit (although young) is a writer and aspired to one day ""see her name in print.""  The quick-witted Kit quickly learns that persistence, practice, patience and a creative ""angle"" were necessary for her ""reporting"" to get from her typewriter to newspaper print!",1238803200,,917,4.883870967741935

It also has a great cast of actors so I sat down to enjoy it with them.  The main plot itself was nice; basically a lesson of not judging a book by its cover.
However, riddled throughout the movie is this message that's drilled at you over and over again that: rich people are selfish; rich people are evil; rich people are mean and nasty.  Adding weight to the ""rich people are evil"" motif, is another display, in a long line of twisted takes on the story of Robin Hood, simplifying the character of Robin Hood to that of someone that steals from the rich and gives to the poor.  When actually, the important detail of the story of Robin Hood is his motive: he steals the people's taxes back from a tyrannical government that is overtaxing the people.  But anyway, it's just unfortunate that the creators of this movie (ironically enough, rich people) saw fit to ruin what might have been a good family movie by peppering it with their ridiculous propaganda.",1232496000,13,1121,4.613065326633166

3204431,2,B000WGVEAC,"Kit Kittredge American girl is about a young girl who aspires to be a reporter while growing up during the depression. The American Girl series is a wholesome series, featuring girls from different walks of life and backgrounds who face challenges and overcome them using ther brains, their friendships and common sense.

I felt Kit Kittredge wasn't my favorite story and was actually a bit boring. Kit and her friends were nice, but lacked that spark that made them loveable (Like Samantha) and were a bit wooden. This was the Depression, and yet, Kit and her mother were fairly well off. They could've done a bit more to illustrate how hard times were for this family specifically. True, they took in boarders, but overall they were better off and better groomed than most.

The subplot involving the robbery was a bit silly and the hobos.. Eh. Took up most of the story. Children might enjoy Kit Kittredge, but I found the acting a bit wooden, and the hobo's and their story overwhelmed Kit's a bit, there just wasn't spark in this story to capture my interest.",1230508800,6,1064,4.71505376344086
3204432,3,B000WGVEAC,"This is a good movie for families, and if you have a young girl in your family that likes the American Girl series, she will enjoy it especially. Abigail Breslin nails a performance that carries the movie, and the look and feel of the movie evokes the time period well. As such, this will most likely get multiple viewings in your house and it's just marginally worth purchasing.

The theatrical aspect ratio of this movie was 1.85:1 and this release has the picture cropped down to a widescreen-TV-matching aspect ratio of 1.78:1. While that only represents less than a 4% loss of picture composition (unless it was open-matted to gain extra height from the original negative), I'd prefer it if movie studios didn't modify the composition of their movies on Blu-ray or DVD.

Even though there are trailers for other American Girl movies, there is no trailer for the movie on the disc. I wish that more studios would do this, as it provides a way to see how the movie was marketed at the time and it's something that should be easy to include.

Normally, I'd like to see more extras on a disc to make it worth purchasing. Such extras reward those who choose to purchase instead of rent and it allows them to get more enjoyment from the title that goes past just watching the movie.

If you can get it at a good price, this DVD is worth purchasing if you have an American Girl fan in your house.",1230508800,3,1394,4.4980237154150196

I haven't seen the Kit Kittredge movie yet because I received a blank DVD to download from the Warner Brothers website. The information on the case said NOTHING about that. Nor did the amazon website. Even when I called amazon to find out why I got a blank DVD, the person I spoke to insisted a movie is indeed on the DVD shown on the amazon website because the description on the website referred to a language and a movie length.
Unfortunately, my ""antique"" computer doesn't have a DVD drive. I do expect I'll thoroughly enjoy the movie when I finally see it.
It was a gift so I've been told that I won't be charged a re-stocking fee when I return the blank DVD.

3204469,5,B000WGVEAC,"I missed the ""Kit Kittredge - An American Girl"" film when it was shown in movie theaters a few months ago, but I snapped up the DVD at first sight. Movie critics and reviewers had said it was excellent. It was! It was a wonderful period movie that will bear watching again and again. My wife said it was a story for children, and I suppose that's true, but it's much, much more. The movie is set in 1934, the heart of the Great Depression. Well, I was born about that time and I don't remember much before 1940, but the folks and our relatives always had a lot of tales of those days and, for us, much of the 40s were not all that different .

The movie is just wonderfully done. All the 30s and earlier cars on the streets were just amazing. The wonderful neighborhood scenes seemed so authentic. The people and their acting and appearance all appeared completely authentic. The 30s music was completely appropriate. Everything seemed so authentic and believable that you might simply relax and be transported back to relive that era. The period depiction, in itself, should bring an Oscar nomination.

The acting was excellent. All of the characters seemed believable and fit the 30s scene ideally. The kids, in particular, were outstanding for depicting kids of that era. Surely, the director will receive an Oscar nomination. A little story of Kit Kitterage serving as a writer and amateur detective kept the interest and might be the highlight of the movie for children. For me, the whole movie was achingly sad and painful. I felt so sorry for the people caught up in the ever increasing economic blight and I wondered if we might not be sliding into another such situation.

Abigail Breslin was particularly outstanding. I fell in love with her in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and her role in this movie was just as good, if not better. This young lady is a rising star, without question. She should get an Oscar nomination for this performance. But, of course, she had such an excellent supporting cast and that really made her stand out.

This is an outstanding movie from a variety of viewpoints. First rate!

As the movie opens, we see unfortunate neighbors with foreclosure signs in their yards, belongings being seized, and soup kitchens. Kit's situation goes from comfortable to pinched overnight; the bank seizes the dealership, her father moves to Chicago to look for work, and her mother must take in boarders to make ends meet.  From there, it's only a short step to selling eggs, and then the poorhouse.

Kit's generally optimistic outlook is nearly crushed under this avalanche of adult responsibilities, but her father gently tells her not to let it beat her before he leaves to look for work. Kit throws herself into her writing, penning a kid's eye view of the Depression as she volunteers at soup kitchens and befriends two young hobos, Will and Countee (Max Thieriot, who played Nancy Drew's boyfriend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew/dp/B00005JPO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew</a>, and Willow Smith).

The new boarders are the subject of many of her articles. There's magician Mr. Berk (Stanley Tucci), mobile librarian Ms. Bond (Joan Cusack), Mrs. Howard and her son Stirling, and the exotic dance instructor Miss Dooley.

But danger strikes  as a series of robberies perpetrated by hobos sweeps the nation, and Will and Countee find themselves unwelcome, especially after Will is implicated in two robberies that hit close to home. Kit and her friends Ruthie and Stirling set out to solve the mystery of who would frame Will.

The film does a wonderful job at capturing 1930s atmosphere, particularly in the soundtrack department.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kit-Kittredge-An-American-Girl-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0017V7HB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kit Kittredge: An American Girl - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;contains two fabulous tracks by the Puppini Sisters (retro 1940s-style vocal harmonies), Ain't We Got Fun by retro songbird Renee Olstead, and vintage tracks by Spike Jones, Billie Holiday, Cliff Edwards, and Xavier Cugat.

Kit Kittredge is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.  The story (and I haven't read the book series that it's based on) is a gently old-fashioned tale of respect, altruism, and optimism in the face of difficulty that will resonate with parents, and kids will enjoy the blend of magic shows, funny characters, and mystery.  The solid acting from the big-name cast, headlined by Abigail, offers up a sanitized but effective overview of the atmosphere of the Great Depression, particularly salient as our nation once again finds itself in a sea of foreclosures, high unemployment, and the threat of recession if not depression.",1226361600,2,3813,6.551587301587301

3204502,4,B000WGVEAC,"What a refreshing change!  In a world of increasingly violent, filthy, and vulgar movies, Kitt Kittredge stands tall and proud.  In essence, this is a solid story with a splendid cast.
The story revolves around its title character, Kitt (Abigail Breslin), a plucky eleven-year-old who deals with peer pressure, drastic changes in her life-style, rejection, etc., etc.
The movie flows well and has a relatively plausible story-line, which at times prompts audible laughter from the audience.  There is a serious side,too, including threats (laughable though they may be) against the children and a visit to a hobo ""jungle,"" or camp.  I appreciated how they portrayed the hoboes as honest people who were down on their luck.  Kitt puts it quite well.
The movie is full of talented young actors and actresses - Max Thieriot, from Nancy Drew and Zach Mills, from Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium; as well as pleasantly familiar faces such as Julia Ormond and Chris O'Donnell.  And that's just dropping a few names; you'll recognize at least three other faces.",1224806400,4,1053,5.093023255813954

To my sheer astonishment, KIT KITTREDGE: AN AMERICAN GIRL is a throwback to those great films, entertaining, absorbing, and for adults as well as children. Abigail Breslin doesn't play Kit, she IS Kit, from her bobbed hair to her scuffed Mary Janes: resourceful, clever, imaginative. Even if the final chase of the movie does get a little slapstick, everything else clicks in this grand film. Zach Mills is stunning as Stirling, one of the boarders taken in at the Kittredge home after Kit's dad loses his job, a boy who has had to face the hard facts of life earlier than expected, and there are two marvelous supporting character performances from Colin Mochrie as one of the denizens of the hobo jungle and Wallace Shawn as the newspaper editor Kit tries to win over.
