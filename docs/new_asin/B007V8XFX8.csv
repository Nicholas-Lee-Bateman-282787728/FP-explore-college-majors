It is amazing that they have worked as long as they have and not fallen by the way side due to drugs and the other excesses you read about concerning those in the music business.  This is the story of 3 very dedicated men who in my opinion have truly made it.  You don't need a Grammy to make it in my opinion.  I think of those who received Grammies and died needlessly or those who are long forgotten.  Ernie, Cory and Brian Orosco are award winners in my book any day.  Their story is inspiring and as Cory puts it, ""we're still here"".  God bless them!",1418515200,,698,4.149253731343284
