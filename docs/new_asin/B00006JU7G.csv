The problem though, is this DVD is sorely lacking something important: the original Japanese version of the show! Yes, this is ~dub only~, unlike most anime DVDs which give you the option to see the show in it's original format with english subtitles.
If it weren't for that, this would be a DVD worth buying, but unfortunately it isn't. =(",1062720000,6,565,4.594059405940594
1782437,5,B00006JU7G,"If your kids are anything like mine, they will love it.
An untalkative hero Kirby is, but what he lacks in word power he makes up for in suction power!!
If you've played the game then you'll expect more of the same simple but fun entertainment that the games have given kids in the past. From fresh animation to a catchy theme song, your kids should want to watch this over and over again. (I know I've seen it several times and still enjoy it!)
Hopefully the 2nd DVD will be out soon (Dark and Stormy Knight-?-), but there are some unexpected production delays or something. Kirbykirbykirby.com says it will be soon, but it's been ""soon"" for several months now and no release date in sight yet....",1055808000,4,698,4.503937007874016
1782438,5,B00006JU7G,"The Kirby game series on Nintendo has always been one of my favorites and so when I heard that they were planning on making a Kirby anime I was very much looking forward to it.
Of course my biggest fear for was much like all games that they make into animes, was that they would not do the source material justice.
Fortunately the anime does a great job of capturing the feel of the Kirby games.  Just like in the games Kirby has the ability to suck up his enemies and absorb their powers.  For example the first major enemies Kirby fights is a giant fire breathing Octopus. Kirby beats it by sucking up it's fire and beating it with it's own ability.
And in each episode Kirby will fight a different enemy, some of which will be familiar from the games.
All of the characters in this show you can't help but like even the bad guys. Escargoon, King DeDeDe's minion is one of my favorites because he's such a funny character.  Speaking of which, the anime also has a great sense of humor.  I found myself laughing quite a bit.
But the best thing of all, is that this show has got was has to be one of the catchiest opening themes I've ever heard.  Every time I think of it I want to sing it aloud.
So if you are into the Kirby series like I am or your just looking for a good funny series then you will probably enjoy it.  Just a word of warning to all those anime Otaku's out there:  You can only watch this anime in English not in Japanese. But the voice acting is fairly decent so it's not much of a problem.",1043193600,10,1510,4.1506849315068495

1782446,2,B00006JU7G,"Vol. one suggests that that this is season one. This is not the case, this is only three episodes. Upon further inspection I realize that it clearly states this fact in the description so I don't claim false advertising at all. My bone of contention is that there are over 100 episodes of this cartoon title and they chosen to vend them three at a time. Too little for the price.",1366243200,2,379,4.352112676056338
