8269069,1,B0018BDDHM,"I considered buying this film but then decided to rent it instead.  I am so thankful I did that.  My partner and I endured this film to the end.  She got up about a 1/4 of the way through and I made her sit back down.  It really took all my strenghth to actually watch it to the end.  This film is about two high school friends,who we are told shared a kiss at some graduation function.  10 yrs pass and they meet up again on the premise of a reunion.  Their lives took extremely different routes but neither ever got past the moment they shared. Blah Blah Blah.  They fight almost continuously from the moment they reconnect.  Then after all is said and done they part ways again mysteriously healed. Absolutely lame, should not be listed under gay and lesbian catagory.  Its really about to friends who really don't know one another.",1311120000,2,835,4.398692810457517
8269070,3,B0018BDDHM,"I can honestly relate to this movie.  I always wonder what happened to my childhood sweetheart and how I would feel/react seeing them again.  This story is above two woman who take different paths in lives, but through a 10 year school reunion get to see each other again.  It's a hart warming movie, of two people coming to terms with their current lives and each other.  This is rather a low cost production, an old house forms the back drop of 99% of the scenes. The acresses deliver an outstanding performs and capture past hidden feelings.  If you are looking for a fast or raunchy movie, then this film is not for you.",1294876800,,624,4.43859649122807
8269071,3,B0018BDDHM,"I was looking forward to this one, especially since I'm an aussie, I was expecting a little more, but ended up somewhat disappointed.  Everything about it was ..... bland, but then again I suppose that's life for most, it's quite ordinary. It was good to see two lead actresses who weren't godesses and a storyline which was believable, even if painful at times.",1287705600,,362,4.746031746031746
8269072,1,B0018BDDHM,"Ordered this movie and thought it was supposed to be a decent film.  Wrong.  The seller was great but this is one i should have watched because someone else rented it. I should have saved my money. Watching it is like watching  a home video that uses three different scenes, the kitchen, the living room and the front yard.  Acting was very poor and ""where is all the lesbian action""? more about a lonely woman that gained a lot of weight and was miserable so she ate more.  She happened to know a girl from school ten yrs prior that happened to be gay.  Very boring. I don't expect porn or even  make out scenes but the story was SLOW, boring and not a gay enough story line.  I mean i'd like movies like Kissing Jessica Stein, Chutney Popcorn, The incredible true adventures of two girls in love, The Journey, Treading Water, DEBS, Claires Moon, Aimee and Jaguar!!! The Gymnast, Gray matters.  All these were worth spending my gay dollars on!!!!",1236470400,10,947,4.491228070175438
8269073,4,B0018BDDHM,"This Kiss  - Directed by Kylie Eddy
A very low budget picture, shot over a few days with a very small cast, made by women for men and women.  It started with a `Innocent Kiss' between two students at the end of high school.  They both went their separate ways after graduation. Lucy the fatty one, married had children and became a wreck.  Juliette a skinny and a lesbian went up the corporate ladder and also became a wreck.
In the 67 minutes, the director described how Juliette returned to her school friend  with the intention of attending the forthcoming reunion and although in the beginning none wanted to admit to the reality of life they were living, both ended realizing the wrecks they had became.  The original `THIS KISS' had always lingered in their lives, Juliette from the lesbian feelings and Lucy was destructed with it as she never had lesbian tendencies although admits that females can become easily intimate rather than males.
A very good film indeed; very moving from one scene to another with a great dialogue.  Settings and photography really good.  Only one thing had really distracted me.

 During the first thirty minutes or so, when  the setting was outdoors,  a horrific sound like `wind howling around'  erupts immediately as any one of the two actresses stopped talking.  With a surround system is much worst.  At first I thought it was my sound system.  But it wasn't.  I couldn't believe that this was put in intentionally",1223942400,,1456,4.76
8269074,5,B0018BDDHM,"I first saw this film at the gay and lesbian film festival in Austin, Texas last year.  I immediately emailed the director to tell her how much I had enjoyed it and emailed gay and lesbian television stations and dvd companies to recommend it.  ""This Kiss"" and ""Nina's Heavenly Delights"" were by far my two favorite films of the festival.

""This Kiss"" is about a woman who comes back to her hometown in Australia for a school reunion.  She stops by an estranged friend's house before the festivities.  It is about the two friends getting reaquainted and dealing with issues from their past.  The issues are realistic and the interaction between the two actresses is genuine.

SPOILER---------------This film is not about two lesbians who meet after years of separation and ride off into the sunset together.  It is about two friends who meet, deal with issues from their past and are able to move on and remain good friends.  If you want a happily ever after, feel good, lesbian romance, I recommend ""Nina's Heavenly Delights.""",1215043200,26,1027,4.822857142857143
