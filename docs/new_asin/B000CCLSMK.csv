8097560,2,B000CCLSMK,"I'll get straight to the point... no ""Bad Boys"", no ""Young Guns (Go For It)"", no ""Careless Whisper"", no ""A Different Corner"". I am quite cheesed off. I realise that ""Careless Whisper"" and ""A Different Corner"" are technically solo hits for George but they ARE on Wham! albums. As a matter of fact, ""Careless Whisper"" was released as Wham! (featuring George Michael). Please don't get me wrong; I love George Michael and I love Wham! but I just wish that there was more substance to this DVD compilation. I would love to have a commentary by George AND Andrew (they still talk, you know) and a making of some of the videos, maybe ""Blue - Live In China"" or ANYTHING live. Yes, I realise that the ""Everything She Wants"" video is ""live"" but it is just the studio version dubbed over a live video segment. Unfortunately, this is what happens when Columbia/Sony Records releases a Wham! DVD without George Michael's input. Well, that's all for now.
