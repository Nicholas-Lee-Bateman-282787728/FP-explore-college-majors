2216177,2,B0007KZQAC,"Where in the world is the ORIGINAL Astro Boy series on DVD?  By far, it is the best Astro Boy series ever made.  Maybe its release is being held up to coincide with the film that has been in the works for eons.  No matter: it's a crime that fans all over the country who remember and love the 1960's version have to continue to be denied.

This release is the most recent version...it ran on the WB and Cartoon Network; both pulled the plug quickly.  And the late, great Billie Lou Watt is not the voice here, either...she can be heard on the original English versions---IF SOMEONE SOMEWHERE WOULD HAVE THE GOOD SENSE TO RELEASE THEM!  I'm holding out for those original cartoons.  They're the real, genuine Astro Boy.",1110585600,21,718,4.476923076923077
2216178,5,B0007KZQAC,"many other reviews here complain this isn't the 1960's anime, and while i see where they're coming from...duh. nor the 1979-80 series that many people saw growing up. this 2003 series takes the best elements of the previous two shows, as well as the original manga, and creates a veritable masterpiece of what is already considered THE essential anime. incredibly produced and with one of the best english dubs of the last decade, this show should be a part of every anime collection, and should go on the shelf where it belongs, right next to the other two shows and the graphic novels. PICK THIS ONE UP!!",1109808000,10,606,4.672897196261682
2216179,5,B0007KZQAC,"This is the 2004 dub of the series that release in japan in 2003
It aired  on Kids WB and Cartoon Network in The USA
 Well is it a remake of the 1980 color version?

  Maybe If you look into it the 1963 version of the series you
will see remakes from there  in both the 1980's and 2003/04
versions! Even if only  104 of the 193 made it to the us in the 1963 b&w series

the 2003/04 versions are pretty close

Now the 1980's ver you should have both  because the story lines go off in differtent direction right away

the orig 63 show is available in 6 boxset from japan is about 1,500 bucks and is only in japanese
and ep 125 is the only one that is kinda missing ( done with stills )
here is the real review for the set for sale here.

The first Japanese manga to be adapted into an animated series, ASTRO BOY was directed by the legendary Osamu Tezuka, and is representative of a nostalgic golden age of comics. Astro is a robot who lives in the ""retro-futuristic"" Metro City. Originally created by research scientist Dr. Tenma in the image of his deceased son, he was discarded with the scientist's realization that his son could never be replaced. Later discovered by the kindly Dr. O'Shay, Astro was revived and given a robot family, while O'Shay served as his mentor, in the belief that humans and robots can and should get along with each other. Astro, however, is not like other robots; in addition to his superior strength and jet-rocket arms and legs, his brain is the most advanced in the world, and it is capable of feeling all human emotions. Astro is a reluctant superhero, fighting to keep the peace between robots and humans, and always coming to the city's rescue against all manner of nefarious evildoers. Episodes include ""Rocket Ball,"" ""Franken,"" ""Deep City,"" and ""The Blue Knight.""",1109462400,15,1802,4.460365853658536
2216180,5,B0007KZQAC,"oh boy i grew up watching this series and had dreams about  astro boy more than any other cartoon characters.

i ordered one but confused from reading other revews.

are we getting the 2003 version with english dubbing?

is the 2003 version that was on tv in japan remake of the 1980's version with same episodes and story line plus extra episodes? or is it pretty much a whole new story?",1108857600,,388,4.422535211267606
2216181,2,B0007KZQAC,Sony has ruined Astro boy. I really wanted to buy this series (which is the 2003 version and not the 1960's version) but I figured out that there is no japanese audio track and I have to listen to horrible dubs. Sony needs to stop distributing anime because they just ruin it. Why can't they just follow everyone else and include a japanese track and english subtitles?That's why their anime doesn't sell as much as others.,1108684800,4,423,4.578947368421052
2216182,5,B0007KZQAC,"Unlike what the others have said, this is in fact the new series.  It originly aired in Japan, but came to Cartoon Network last year.  This series is special though because it has 50 episodes, but 29 of those we have never seen!  I give this 5 stars because it is not only for kids but also for adults.  The series has barley been changed and has almost all the same characters.  I for one can not wait for this 5 disk set and you should too.  Can't wait until March 29, which is when it is comming out.  Pre-order now!",1108512000,3,519,4.079207920792079

2216205,4,B0007KZQAC,"This comes in a standard multidisk DVD case, containing 4 disks with all 50 episodes of Astro Boy's 2003 reboot on them. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1 full frame. This seems to be the same image quality/sound quality as the Sony release. On the main menu, you have recycled art from the cover with a nice colorful galaxy behind Astro Boy. There are two options on this menu, play all or episode select. Upon entering an episode, there was no way to activate subtitles on my Xbox One. But there are no language options or anything like that, so you're stuck with the English dub. The episodes are listed on the discs themselves and there is nothing included on the manual holder side of the case. Just a barebones budget release.

If you want Japanese audio and English subs, you are going to have to import the DVD collections. If you are looking for the English Dub that is much more lavish for the same price (on amazon as of 7/9), I recommend the original release:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astro-Boy-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0007KZQAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astro Boy - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;as this set has an outer sleeve with 5 discs each with their own unique artwork for each case.

2216219,5,B0007KZQAC,"The Astro Boy 2003 series presents itself on three levels. On the surface, kids' stuff, and on the second, something for the cult following that every major form of entertainment seems to gather. Underneath all that lies something no less than a work of literature. One may find it strange to call a Saturday morning kiddy cartoon 'literature', but it is. It speaks to much in us that is human. The characters are more than simply robots and humans. Each one moves across the stage as the series progresses; one finds different characters with different agendas, conflicts, misunderstandings, reconciliations and resolutions. That is the stuff of drama.
  It was the genius of Osamu Tezuka to make the hero of his manga a robot. Little Astro has to grow, not only learning how to deal with villains many times his size, but also how to diplomatic. As the series goes on, his goal in life becomes clear: to have humans and robots dwell together in harmony. But others grow, as well. Astro is not without his faults; twice he doesn't listen to his little sister Zoran and gets into trouble for it. And in the end, he has to reconcile with his creator, the evil Dr. Tinma, who himself finally comes to his senses. For all his powers, though, he is quite modest, shunning a well-deserved limelight when equal rights for robots is finally declared.
  To be true, the English dub of Astro Boy (Tetsuwan Atom in Japanese) is not flawless. It would have been better to retain the Japanese opening and closing music, and much of the background music, though at times the English dub background music is apropos to the story line. Its main failing, however, is in mixing up the order of episodes as compared with the Japanese. To get the maximum benefit out of the Astro Boy 2003 series, it should be viewed in the same order as was shown in Japan (charts available online). And one should look behind the kids' stuff to find a story that provokes deep thought at times.
  As to the dub, in places the English dialog departs from the Japanese; sometimes it's actually better. (However, allowances must be made for cultural differences, so, what is better for me may not be so for someone from elsewhere.} All in all, the series calls for a sequel, perhaps (taking a cue from the 2009 movie) an adolescent Astro in middle school with all the adventures, both serious and humorous that happen there. But that is up to the producers.
  This series of Astro Boy may well end up like many works of literature: not intended to be any more than light entertainment, but winding up being a classic. What Osamu Tezuka started was followed up on very well after his passing. I enjoyed it very much, and consider it a worthy addition to my library.",1372636800,3,2727,4.643153526970955

The only negative in this set is that some of the episodes are out of order, so it may spoil a few plot points if you watch them straight through the order on the disks.

2216225,1,B0007KZQAC,"Im a lucky owner of the Korean DVD Boxes but until today i haven't seen the complete Show (they only released the Discs 1-6). So just lately i watched again all the Discs i have and it was again so wonderful to enjoy this great Show. So the more i finally wanted to see the End of the whole Story so i did buy this Box... !!!
But what did they do to this Masterpiece!!!!! It truly brakes my heart and i regret so much i did support such a Version!!!
How could they (Sony!!!) cripple this cult-serie like this:
From 5.1 Surround Sound to Stereo, cut out some ""darker"" Scenes, release it without japanese Language-/Sound Track and then cut it down from 16:9 to 4:3?!? It really makes my heart bleed.

It is a shame what they did do to Mr. Tezukas Legacy and it makes me sick. Today they should have known that true Anime Fans want see the movies in its original Language. And believe me, the english track is a catastrophe, it sounds like they just picked up some people from the Street and let them speak the Dialogues :-( It makes your ears bleed and the new Music they gave the Show is just as awful too. And because i know the Original Orchestral Track it  hurts my ears even more.
And what me also makes angry, is that they already had it perfectly from the Japanese Version, they just had to put the english subtitles in it and let the rest as it was!!!!!!!! Then the Fans over the whole World would have buyed it!!!!!!! But No, they did invest Money to make it a useless Product,... what where they thinking?????!!!!!!?????

So im seriously thinking of buying the japanese DVDs (my DVD player runs it natively) and watch it without understanding the Dialogues... it would be still much better then to torture myself with the US Version again but costs me a lot of Money...

So all Astro Boy Fans should write Sony some serious Feedback Mails so they hopefully release it better on Blu-ray!!!",1330732800,6,1896,4.3931623931623935
2216226,4,B0007KZQAC,"I didn't realize till after I'd bought this set that it wasn't the original Astro I remember from TV, but on the whole it's equally as good as that version, and in some ways perhaps better.  Unlike the original, when you look back over it you can see a coherence to the way everything hangs together and builds toward a climactic confrontation.  In the late 22nd Century, the greatest community on earth is the city-state of Metro City, a place of massively beautiful buildings and a population of 10,000,000 persons.  Here stands the Ministry of Science, where the eminent cyberscientist Dr. O'Shay brings to life a robot boy he names Astro, one of a new generation of robots who have ""kokoro""--heart, emotion, soul, and AI, the ability to think independently and learn from their experiences.  Almost from the beginning we begin to see that there's more to Astro than meets the eye, for he seems to have *two* creators: O'Shay and the mysterious and sinister genius Dr. Tenma, who continues to pop up regularly throughout the 50 episodes in the set.  Meanwhile Astro is learning to use his powers--flight (his boots turn into jets at a thought), laser beams in his forefinger and arm, scanning and computing capabilities, and fantastic strength (he can slow down a falling satellite or catch a skybus about to crash and gently bring it to the tarmac)--and confronting criminals, fanatics, and the merely misguided, some of them human, some robotic.  Yet for all his wonderful powers, he's still in some ways the child he appears: idealistic, eager to be friends with everyone, liking to hang out with his school friends, sometimes loving and sometimes being annoyed by Zoron, the little sister Dr. O'Shay creates for him, and enthusiastic about new tasks and partnerships.  The final half-dozen episodes form an arc in which Astro is told he must choose between robots and humans, while trying to prevent a war between them and confronting the mystery of his own origins.

Like all anime, the series has a distinctive look--and a distracting tendency to bestow Japanese names on characters who are clearly Caucasian, like Dr. O'Shay's executive assistant, the redheaded Yuko, and the trench-coated Detective Tawashi, the highest-ranking plainclothesman in the Metro City Police Force.  The voice talents are quite good--although it's been many years since I saw the original, they somehow ring familiarly in my ear--and the animation, while hardly Disney, is still impressive for its type: in some scenes there's a CGI look about it, and the special effects occasionally put on a light show not equaled since the Jefferson Starship played the Fillmore.  The robots range from the titanic to the amusing (like Momo, the pink ostrich who serves as Yuko's mobile computer, and one that resembles a Koala bear); some are so humanoid that they can literally ""pass,"" while others, like Dr. O'Shay's barrel-like housekeeper Nora, are more of the classic type.  You can also find the original series on DVD in (so far) two sets:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astro-Boy-Ultra-Collector-s-Edition-DVD-Set-1/dp/B000E3LGDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astro Boy - Ultra Collector's Edition DVD Set 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astro-Boy-Set-2-Ultra-Collector-s-Edition-Original-TV-Series/dp/B000G73UOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astro Boy, Set 2: Ultra Collector's Edition ( Original TV Series )</a>.",1286236800,2,3494,5.611005692599621
2216227,5,B0007KZQAC,"There are a number of people who wrote reviews for this collection who have rated it unfairly due to a couple of misunderstandings. These people have said that the DVD collection plays the episodes out of order. This is only true to a point. This set does play the episodes out of chronological order but it plays them in the order of air date for the U.S. market. When originally aired in the U.S. it was sometimes played on the W.B. and sometimes on Cartoon Network, this caused some confusion as to which episodes were played and when so it caused them to be played out of order. Not to mention all of the episodes which never even aired in the U.S.

Also this is the 2003-2004 series collection, not the eighties or the sixties collections. It is absolutely ridiculous to give this collection a bad rating simply because this isn't either of those two versions. If you bought this expecting it to be either one of the others it's your fault for not reading the product description. Don't blame the collection or Amazon for your mistake!

Additionally some people are complaining about name changes in this version! Really? What's wrong with the name Dr. O'Shay? Do you really want the eighties name of Dr. ELEPHANT, because I surely don't. Used to really bother me when I was a kid watching the eighties version, Dr. Elephant, please.

Now, besides that this is a wonderful program that ALL lovers of anime should get as quickly as possible! Does it veer away from some of the campy light-heartedness of the 60's show? Yes. Is it faithful to the original manga? Mostly, minus some camp. Does this version still have the meritorious social commentary of the original?? Definitely! Does it have an awesome updated techno soundtrack? Absolutely! Here is the listing of episodes as they appear in the box set and I have put the proper chronological episodes in parentheses for you.

In the case of this series from 2003, it is a wonderful experience. I will agree, the Japanese version of the series was more insightful within the dialogue and the episodes were...in order *cough*, but this series was still great in English. I really enjoyed the animation (which is quite lively for anime, practically movie quality at most times) and the stories were wonderful. I definitely enjoyed the ending story arc and even cried when I watched the final episode! It was very emotional.

Some people do not like the fact that some characters were renamed in the dub, but I personally prefer the name 'Dr. O'Shay' over 'Dr. Elefun'. :3 Personal preference.

Now, it is saddening that one episode was replaced with a clip show (basically Tenma going over stuff that you saw two discs ago...feel free to skip this episode, lawls), and I wish it included the Japanese language tracks, but this series is still up there with its predecessors.

Don't knock it because it's new. View it before you review it!

2216231,4,B0007KZQAC,"I saw the theatrical movie the day it came out and loved it, so went and bought the 1980s color remake version DVD set and this 2003 version DVD set. I gave this product 4 stars because the series itself is great and I would highly recommend purchasing it, but there are a few flaws with this DVD set that made it so I could not give it 5 stars.

1. My primary problem with this set is it does not have the option of Japanese with English translation subtitles that I prefer having while watching anime (the 1980s set did though).

2. My next concern is there are several scenes missing throughout the episodes. Also most of the episodes are out of order, but that didn't bother me as much as the lack of Japanese language option and the missing scenes.
--Many of the missing scenes I don't understand why they cut, like the scene in the second episode that explains why Astro sleeps even though he's a robot.
--A couple more examples are: 1)the missing scenes of how Tobio died, Dr. Tenma finding Tobio after the car accident, and crying over his dead son (there's no blood/gore) in a couple episodes; 2)in the first episode when Astro is flying for the first time they cut some cute parts of his interactions with robots and humans (including a man and his daughter who you see later in the episode and other episodes).
--In this DVD set Atlas is said to have always been a robot and is just remade, but in the uncut he was actually the man's son who died in an accident and Dr. Tenma agrees to make the robot with the boy's memories (like he did with Tobio).
--Also, the episodes are originally in widescreen.
--Even though I bought an import uncut copy (Japanese with English/Chinese subtitles) of the series I would still buy a domestic uncut release, partly because the translation subtitles on the import are not great quality and are a little hard to understand at times.

3. This I thought was funny more than a problem. When watching the episode ""Dawn of the Techno-Revolution"", which is completely made up of scenes from other episodes in the series, I saw a scene of Astro in front of a fountain with a boy that appeared to be in a wheel chair that does not fit with any of the other episodes. This scene is actually from an episode that was completely cut out and ""Dawn of the Techno-Revolution"" replaced. Why cut an episode and include a scene from it in the episode that they replaced it with? LOL
--The cut episode has to do with Astro and his school friends watch a robot play of Peter Pan in a park and bring up the fact that Astro will never grow up. A man nearby has the robot fairy sprinkle dust on the kids watching, which allows him to hypnotize the kids that night. The hypnotized kids end up on a flying space craft that looks like a pirate ship. The man plans to use a device he built that will make it so the kids will never grow up and take the kids to a place in space he made to look like Neverland. Astro is trying to find his missing friends and meets a boy in a floating (wheel) chair in front of a fountain in the park who is also looking for missing friends. The two boys find the ship and rescue the kids who when no longer hypnotized tell what they want to be when they grow up and also tell Astro they will always be his friend even though he will never grow up.

Thank you for reading my review, again I highly recommend this series and please support the release of an uncut DVD and/or Blu-ray set for this series in the U.S.!  =)",1259193600,36,4574,4.3689776733254995
2216232,4,B0007KZQAC,"to reduce confusion of Astro Boy DVD series, please note that there have been 3 series so far:  the Black and White 1963 series, the 1980 First Color version, and the 2003 Color version with different stories.

The black and white 1963 version has 193 episodes.

The 1980 version has 52 episodes for the Japanese version, with the first and second episodes merged and cut into 1 episode as the US version.  The birth of the character Atlas is removed in the US version.  As a result, the US version only has 51 episodes.

The 2003 version has 50 episodes.  This version once again has one more episode in the Japanese version.  The US version has 1 episode less, which is replaced by a ""clip show episode"". (probably meaning frame by frame).  Personally, I think the 1980 version is slightly cuter than the 2003 version.  The 2003 version is more lavish.

More information can be found on Wikipedia:  use the keyword Astro Boy, and then try Astro Boy 1980 and Astro Boy 2003",1240704000,10,974,4.566473988439307

However, I found out that this series isn't actually complete. It's missing one episode that I know of that was called Atom boy the eternal boy this would've been given a different name in english. I found it on youtube what tipped me off was the opening on the series I brought showing a kid on a flying wheel chair but there was no story in the disc set that covered it. I grew up with Astro boy and I'm glad that they're trying to bring it back. They stayed true to the original drawing design and yet gave it a fresh modern look and a good story line as far as I'm concerned. Seeing it in color for the first time was great.

2216236,5,B0007KZQAC,"""Astro Boy - The Complete Series"" is the best Japanese color anime treatment of Astro Boy, based on the work of the legendary manga and anime artist, Osamu Tezuka. Tezuka's work in manga and anime is unparalleld and stands alone in style and substance in this graphic Japanese genre. He is without peer in the entire ouvre of his work, especially with ""Astro Boy - The Complete Series.""  He is in a class of his own. This is why he richly deserves the subriquette ""The Walt Disney of Japan."" I would heartily recommend ""Astro Boy - The Complete Series"" and all other works of Tezuka's which he produced over his illustrious lifetime.",1209600000,3,633,4.651785714285714

2216241,1,B0007KZQAC,"The remade English version of Astro boy 2003 has proven itself to be the worst disatrous version of all time.

This is my protest against the company that remade Astro boy. Congratulations, you have secussfully turned a piece of juwel into a piece of junk. Whoever incharge for the ""remaking"" 2003 version of astro, evidently has no respect towards Osamu Tezuka.

Before getting this edition, I had seen some orginal episodes from this seiers of which were dubbed in Japanese. I was highly impressed for its charming stories and lively charecters. Delightful as I could be when I found out this show will be relesed on Dcemeber in full boxset collective edition, I did not hesitate to pre-order this item. I waited and waited till the disaster began.

The theme song was gone, the background melody used to be so touching and heartstrings, changed into something metallic and cold-hearted with no emotion at all. Is this kind of music the American kids enjoy nowdays? What make them think that this kind of music is better than its orginal? The background music of this show used to be the key to bring the audience to follow the thempo of the story, now thanks to the changes, I could hardly moved by the story with this metallic din.

The remaking of the dialogues is another reason to fail to bring the audiences along with the stories. What a fantastic job the have done! Not only did they change the dialogues, but somehow they have managed to change the whole stories. What it used to stimulate deep thoughts, now has become totally rubbish and rediculous. The English dubbing has also failed to bring this version into a higher level. In the specail features, this so-called director Michael Hack questioned the Japanese production crew of ""why would make a children's programe look so sad""? Therefore it turns out to be a perfect edition better than its predessor. Thanks to this director, it proves that kids nowday are mindless glasses afterwards.

I will not recomend anyone to buy this edition, especially for those who are fans of Astro boy, I strongly suggest you to skip it for the sake of your memory.

Due to my experience with this set, I have very little hope and expection for the upcoming relese boxset of astro boy 1980 the Amercian version.",1130889600,32,2263,4.745547073791348

2216245,5,B0007KZQAC,"Astro, the beginning of all the world's anime. This young robot boy with the ability to think and feel like a human is truly a joy to have in anyone's anime collection. When the series aired on KTLA and later on Cartoon Network, I was impressed and astonished. Superb, top quality anime in all its glory, that is Astro Boy! Too bad both networks cut the series out of their line-ups shortly after it started. Their loss.

The DVD collection comes in a 5-CD set, with 10 episodes each. According to the box, 29 of these 50 episodes were not aired in the U.S. and I would have to agree. Some of these I have never seen before and I know Cartoon Network aired more episodes than KTLA, so if I didn't seen them on T.V., they must not have been planned on being released here. As for the anime itself, all I can say is ""Wow."" They did a superb job revamping the first anime in history into this masterpiece.

The visual quality is incredible. Everything from electricity to circuit boards to explosions to Astro's arm cannon attack, they all please the eyes. Voice acting is also very well-done, each character sounds exactly as they look. There are Spanish and Portuguese versions of the episodes, but no Japanese sadly and neither have subtitles. That's okay though, it doesn't make the anime less enjoyable. Plus, these two languages sound pretty good on the anime, especially if you're a pro in understanding either.

The only thing I can say that is off about this great collection is that the episode order is a bit misplaced. They first show you Astro's sister Zoran on Disc 2, but she actually is officially introduced on Disc 3. Also, flashbacks are shown in one episode, but they are of scenes that happen in future episodes. A slight mistake they have made, but I won't hold it against them. After all, there are so many pros that this small con is easily forgotten.

Extra side note: in historical context of thinking, feeling robot boys, Astro Boy came first and it seems like Megaman was based off of him in practically every way, so remember who the blue bomber should give credit to next time you see him.

Final conclusion: This anime belongs in every anime lover's collection! I haven't even finished watching the whole thing, but it doesn't matter. I know I'm going to love the rest of it. Do yourself a favor and get this. You won't be disappointed, especially if you watched the Metropolis anime. That anime and Astro have the same visual intensity and character design (same staff worked on both), so you're getting more out of buying this DVD set.",1120003200,13,2565,4.591703056768559
