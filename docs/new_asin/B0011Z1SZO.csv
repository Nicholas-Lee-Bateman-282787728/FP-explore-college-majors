3070467,4,B0011Z1SZO,"this is a great video to understand the projection of the ukulele in the years preceding the explosion that the instrument has had since 2008. The path of the underground facility, as well as artists, are presented in a very honest, giving space for artists to comment on what they feel playing ukulele.
 For lovers of old ukuleles will be interesting to watch this video to see what was and what was invented before the growth of factorys of the instrument.",1306022400,6,458,4.654320987654321

3070469,5,B0011Z1SZO,"This documentary is both entertaining and informative.  Having had the typical view of ukulele players as musicians in grass skirts, this viewer was amazed to find the widely varying ukulele playing styles that exist and the fascinating subculture that surrounds the instrument. The music was incredible to put it mildly.  This dvd is totally enjoyable.",1219017600,9,353,5.4
3070470,5,B0011Z1SZO,"Pro:  This movie is great fun. Not sure why another reviewer was so  upset, but maybe the movie hit a nerve? I have been playing the Ukulele, recording Uke CD's and performing worldwide for years as Tornadic Ukulele - and I found this movie to be hilarious, albeit in a slightly dark way. In the same vain as shows documenting UFO conventions in the 1950's , where people talk about spending time on Venus with their alien friends. The difference here is this movie PROVES Ukulele's are real, and they are out there!

3070472,5,B0011Z1SZO,"I thought this doc was a lot of fun.  I agree with all the positive reviews on here.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  This is what a good documentary on a quirky subject was like back before HD filmmaking took over, so it's like a time capsule for indie documentary filmmaking from the early-2000's, as well as a time capsule of what was going on in the world of ukulele fanaticism before the big revival kicked in.  I strongly disagree with the reviews that say the subjects are talentless.  Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's bad or worthless.  The subjects are not only talented, but they do a good job of sending the message that playing the ukulele should be about fun, and not about the stress of being a top-notch virtuoso.  This is quite a collection of colorful characters, in a doc called ROCK THAT UKE, so don't expect to see them fronting symphonies.  The title and subject should be a clear give-away that you're not going to see some slick production aimed at the suburban multiplex crowd.  This is aimed more towards open minded oddball types, of which I am proud to be one, and if you're not in our camp, you might want to look elsewhere for your entertainment.",1383609600,2,1208,4.555555555555555
3070473,5,B0011Z1SZO,"Saying this film is ""about"" ukes and uke music is like saying ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is about mockingbirds or ""Dr. Strangelove"" is about bodily fluids or ""The Bicycle Thief"" is about bicycles and thievery or ""Chinatown"" is about water rights or ""Citizen Kane"" is about a rich dude forcing his tone-deaf mistress upon the opera world. Artists of the human spirit need vehicles in which to ferry their insights about life and death to audiences; these directors chose the ukulele and a certain subset of its players, and their ferry piloting is masterful.

Rock That Uke features people who are serious about the uke, but who don't take themselves too seriously. This documentary inspired me to have more fun making music (and noise) and not worry so much about trying to become a ukulele virtuoso.

So we spent the rest of the day playing ukuleles, strolling around the yard. My wrist hurt the next day. But he taught me how to play it, and a lot of the chord formations. When he was going I walked out to the car and he said, 'Well, wait... I want to leave some ukuleles here.' He'd already given me one, so I said, 'Well, I've got this.' 'No, we may need more!' He opened his trunk and he had a lot of ukulele in there, and I think he left four at my house. He said, 'Well, you never know when we might need them, because not everybody carries one around.'"" -Tom Petty, talking about George Harrison introducing him to the Uke.
This film should be a cult classic. It conjured images of that end of family dinner time, when my great aunt would break out her Uke (the only time we weren't afraid of her- hahaha!) , my grandmother would sit at the piano and we'd all gather around and sing. Great film . Wonderful peek into the lives of Ukelele players. Loved, loved, loved it. -Marianne Hoynes",1383696000,,1170,4.18141592920354

8242970,5,B0011Z1SZO,"Now you tell me, is this a story or is this a story? I'll say! Robertson's handling of this most heavy of topics is both engaging and endearing. Here's this miniature toy guitar of an instrument that has been overlooked. Neglected. Only four strings; how can a miniature guitar expect to be taken seriously with only four strings? And yet for centuries stringed instruments all over the world have had as few as one string. More than this, the profundity of this limitation is relevant in our modern zeitgeist. Consider it the twitter of stringed instruments. Limitations after all force genius to manifest intentionally rather than just existing in an existential primordial soup. And Rock that Uke gives a voice to this song, literally televising the Uke revolution for a generation of westerners not already swept away by four stringed apotheosis; and for those that are already immersed in Uke culture, this will be an affirmation.",1383609600,,935,5.0
8242971,5,B0011Z1SZO,"As someone who didn't know much about the ukelele, Rock That Uke opened a whole world to me, sparked my curiosity and inspired me to pick up the instrument and start making some noise!

This incredible little film is a celebration and full throttle embrace of sound-making and a group of musicians whose passion defies genre and transcends the main stream. The film is a champion of the off beat ukelele universe---Informative, heart felt, human and joyful. Totally worth every moment of the trip!",1383609600,,497,4.916666666666667

Narrated by none other than the charming voice of Holly Hunter, this  film explores the hipper side of the little instrument, whose popularity grows every day. It also reaches the apex of ukulele fabulosity with a delightful chat with elegant strummer and vintage chanteuse, Janet Klein.
This little documentary is an inspiring must -see for all ukulele players and fans . It's also an excellent bit of ukulele propaganda to show to skeptics who may not yet be enlightened to the joy and relevance that the ukulele world delivers .",1383609600,,616,4.923076923076923
8242973,5,B0011Z1SZO,"I don't pretend to be objective about this quirky little film, as I am acquainted with several of the people profiled here. I was on the outskirts of their tiny subset of the Ukulele Universe (and yes, there is one) in the early 2000s, just as filmmaker Bill Robertson was editing ""Rock That Uke"". It is a time capsule, capturing a handful of unusual, entertaining, occasionally brilliant musicians and performers who had chosen the ukulele as their ""axe"". Jake Shimabukuro was a few years from his first mention in ""Rolling Stone""; James Hill was just about to break out; but neither of them appears in ""RTU"". And none of the people interviewed here have achieved their level of notoriety. Not that they were without talent. But Travis Harrelson (since deceased) was pushing 70, Casey Korder of the Rumblepups was wearing a cow suit, Ian Whitcomb's real fame was 60 years ago, and many of the other performers are just plain too weird for prime time. So, no - ""Rock That Uke"" isn't the ""Star Wars"" of the uke world. It's more like the ""Eraserhead"". Comparing it to ""Mighty Uke"" isn't fair to either film. If you love the ukulele, there's room for both.",1383609600,3,1153,4.684729064039409
8242974,5,B0011Z1SZO,"This is a rare look at the bleeding edge of the current ukulele revival. Produced before Jake Shimabukuro's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" took YouTube by storm, Rock that Uke profiles the players who were exploring the uke's past and pushing the envelope into an entirely new vision for what four strings and 12 frets can do--at a time when strumming the uke placed you solidly outside mainstream pop culture.",1383609600,2,410,4.871428571428571
8242975,5,B0011Z1SZO,"Back before the current wave of popularity, one ukulele nut took it upon himself to document the growing ukulele sub-culture. At a time when the ukulele was still derided as a toy by many, and looked upon with disdain by mainstream music, Craig Robertson noticed that there was another ukulele scene quietly growing. Serious musicians, punk rockers, crooners, neo flappers and pop bands were all finding that the diminutive instrument was a force to be reckoned with. ""Rock That Uke"" shows an often overlooked side of the ukulele, documenting the early rise of the current craze. Some will love it, some will hate it, some won't care, but nevertheless, ""Rock that Uke"" remains to be a fabulous glimpse into the beginning of our latest love for the little instrument.",1383609600,,766,4.945736434108527
