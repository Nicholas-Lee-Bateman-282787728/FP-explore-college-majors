8221620,4,B000W8OM8Q,"I know this movie was supposedly campy, etc. but we were actually scared throughout. The soundtrack was unusually effective for a creature movie like this. Moths can be scary enough,and I give these producers credit for not taking the facile path of making them big. Maybe we just like this kind of movie. We were drawn to this movie by the presence throughout of a certain Jamie Luner. She always plays the same character in everything she is in, which is great. I don't want to give it all away, and yes, some of the dialogue is lame, but most of it isn't. The acting we thought was very good. As a B movie, this is among the best. Can there be an A+ B movie? I guess so. This is worth a look. Really. If you are the type of movie watcher who hides in their cocoon, afraid to see anything but the globalist-agenda corporate ""who is the enemy of America this week"" type of movie, stay away. It's your loss. But if you prefer to let your imagination soar (with the alien moths) check it out. Play it through Amazon Instant video. I wouldn't actually buy it. Jamie Luner (as in Luna Moth, har har)fans will not be disappointed. So gather 'round some night, swarm to your computer or DVD player, and see it. Don't turn the screen up too bright, though. You might find yourself orbiting your TV.",1361750400,,1292,4.365145228215767
8221621,2,B000W8OM8Q,"""Threshold"" is a low-budget made for television film about carnivorous moths from outer space. Everything about the production is cheesy from the concept to the script and especially the special effects (the meteorite to the spacesuit is especially lame.) For those of you who have seen ""Alien"" I don't need to recap the plot (""Alien"" is even mentioned in the dialogue at one point...), but for those of you who have not, a space shuttle accidentally brings a new and deadly life form to earth. This time it's a killer moth. Seriously.

The moths swarm, look menacing, and colonize people with B negative blood in a coagulated plot which involves the hunky divorced NASA manager named Geronimo and a single, cute, and very available female ichthyologist, Savannah. The moths infect some already unlikable cast members who grow additional arms with pinchers on the ends and long CGI proboscis tongues that qualify as one of the hokiest special effects I have ever seen. The central theme of earth versus the moths is intertwined with a predictable romance subplot, and a subplot featuring a marital dispute at the home of the awfullest family in Texas. If you guessed this would all end with a shootout and explosion on a decrepit boat, you win the prize. How the plot gets there doesn't matter (and doesn't make sense anyway), but the important thing to know is that the movie is over. Or is it? The utterly predictable ending is supremely annoying and really earns this film in the TV movie hall of shame.

The DVD has no special features, but at least it's cheap. I gave it two stars for unintentional camp value. If you enjoy silly, predictable, and utterly ludicrous horror films, you will enjoy ""Threshold."" Everyone else can move along.",1230422400,13,1742,4.842281879194631
8221622,2,B000W8OM8Q,I expected a light entertainment with minimal intelligence....and Yep you guessed it....I wasn't disappointed. A Sunday afternoon flick of some interest ....for the price even shipped to N.Z it was value....better than a lot of the `B' through `Z' grades I have brought. Good image and sound,1225152000,2,291,5.212765957446808
