1067094,4,6305742413,"This was an okay biopic of Alan Freed, some excellent presentations of early rhythm and blues / rock and roll music and a lovely nostalgic trip down memory lane.  Those Fifties American cars were rather fine too!

The story told us a fair bit about Freed's personal life too, including his apparent inability to save part of his evidently vast fortune for a rainy day and his naiivity regarding his choice of banker.

As enjoyable as it was, the latter part of the film maybe became a bit too much of a hard luck story in Freed's favour and rather glossed over his extra-marital meandering.

On balance, it was still worth a 4 star rating, but on that basis would make the superior ""American Hot Wax"" (which still hasn't appeared as a genuine non rip-off from VHS tape DVD) worthy of five stars.",1249430400,11,795,4.538461538461538
1067095,3,6305742413,"Great music... great sound.. but too much fiction.

The first thing you need to know before watching this 1999 made-for-TV film which was broadcast on NBC (you can actually see where the story pauses for commercials) is that at the END of the credits which follow the film is the following phrase : ""Certain characters and events are fictionalized"". Know that going in and you'll still have a good time, if you know the real facts. I'm guessing this film was made to attract the younger audience that made ""Grease"" a mega-hit, and not those who lived during Freed's all too brief life (which I was lucky to personally  experience). (He died in his mid 40s).

Not only are neither of the radio stations he worked for in both Cleveland and New York given fictitious names. (Couldn't they get the rights?), but many of the records played on the soundtrack - and there are way more than 50 (though all only excerpts) show up in the timeline -2-3 years before their actual chart date. The film uses original recordings and has the actors (all basically unknowns - with the exception of Leon - he has no last name - who plays Jackie Wilson)  lip synching the lyrics. The actor (whose name I forget) channeling Jerry Lee Lewis is by far the best.

Seeing that they needed more name recognition than star Judd Nelson (who plays Freed but neither looks like him nor uses Freed's phrasing) the Director brings in Paula Abdul to play a songwriter who has a sleep-in with Freed late in the film. During the opening credits you will see - IN BIG LETTERS - ""Special appearances by Bobby Rydell and Fabian"" (neither of who, during their careers, was part of Freed's big stars, since they were Philly-based and loyal to Dick Clark). Well, don't blink or you will miss them. They each have one line at the beginning as conservative White parents who are made at the ""race music"" Free began playing.

So, if you are looking for facts, PLEASE look elsewhere. Its almost impossible - unless you know Freed's real story - to know what events ARE true.

But as a fluff music that will bring back memories, this is a fun film to watch. I was really impressed by the sound quality, which was sharp and clear.

If you want to see the real Freed's in action, but know that you are seeing fiction (though no less than this film's details), check out the similarly titled ""Mister Rock and Roll"" (note the spekking differences in the first and third words) from 1957, that stars the real Freed and the REAL artists whose careers he helped launch. (Funny, didn't Nelson get to see this before making this film? He would have known how Freed sounded.)

By the way, there are no special features included and, since it was a TV film, not even a trailer.

1067096,2,6305742413,"All the people here are portrayed like characters. Jackie Wilson makes me think of Little Richard (Leon also played LR in an earlier movie), Little Richard is too gay while singing about girls (he was bi) and they just messed up some facts. The crowd is wilder than at a Metallica concert or so are the acts.

Nelson tries but can't him down correctly, the actor in American Hot Wax did a better job. Still a + for the effort.

1067295,3,6305742413,"This is about the life of Alan Freed. He was a radio announcer in Cleveland, Ohio.  He gave a lot of singers their start in the business. He pulled the crows in. Its to bad that he spent all his money.  As fast as he made the money, he spent it just as fast. He worked all the time and it was hard on his marriage. I got this story, because I knew that Alan Freed was from Cleveland, which I live in a town fifteen minutes from Cleveland, I love any movie that has to do with my city. Alan Freed, he did alot of things wrong and yet he did alot of things for rock n roll,  He stated that rock n roll was here to stay and he was right, and it did. He knew just my listening to songs if it was going to be a hit. He did wonders for rock n roll. He even helped Elvis with his first real concert. It really is to bad that he did do better with his life.",1393372800,,849,3.7055555555555557

1067297,1,6305742413,"This movie is a total farce.  Alan Freed was a phony, from the word, ""go.""  Having known him during his heyday, he was an absolute ""taskmaster,"" always received ""kickbacks"" from the artists that he used to book for his stage shows.  The ""artists"" utilized for the roles of entertainers, don't even come close to the original ones.  Example; Jackie Wilson (pathetic).  In addition, he was broadcasting from WINS radio, from 1955 until his downfall.  He ripped off more radio stations, record companies and individual artists than one can ""shake a stick"" on.  Freed treated his performers horribly.  His movies reflected him as a benevolent, kind and warmhearted person.  The contrary was true.  The entire production leaves much to be desired: cinematography, sound and the quality of performances by the various groups portrayed.  Buy ""Hot American Wax, instead.  Much better.  In addition, the casting is way off base.  Judd Hirsh as Alan Freed?  Give me a break.  DON'T PURCHASE....you'd be wasting your money!!!!!",1377561600,,1016,5.179012345679013
1067298,2,6305742413,"Knowing a lot of the facts concerning Alan Freed, I expected to see an accurate portrayal of events that happened in his life and career.  Instead, I got a chick-flick, highly fictionalized version complete with hackneyed, requisite  stereotypes.  There are countless historical inaccuracies.  If that's OK with you -- and especially if you are someone who needs a lot of romance in you movies -- you might like it.  I was disappointed.",1372896000,,436,5.0
1067623,2,6305742413,The movie is not as good as I expected it to be.

I really enjoyed this movie unfortunately the actor playing the part of Alan Freed looked nothing remotely like him.
Apart from that it was worth watching not only for the music but to find out what really went on in Freeds world.
Very interesting to watch and worth having in your Rock history collection.",1345075200,,475,4.288888888888889

Most of the facts are wrong and the music bits played during the film are sometimes years ahead of when the story is taking place. Being a record collector of the early R & B and doo-wop records, I also noticed that the records that they show playing all have the wrong labels for the song represented. They did not care about getting the facts right. If you just want to see a made up story about a man and the music of the times, this is pretty good. But if you want to see a film closer to the truth about Alan Freed, search out a copy of ""American Hot Wax"".

From the earliest of movie bios, the producers and directors have always made an effort to pad their subjects stories instead of giving the movie goers the absolute true picture.
Alan Freed was more than the man that coined the phrase rock n roll. He was a pioneer of race relations in this country. The exact thing that made him a target of the old guard, the same people that wanted to keep the status quo among the races.
The film was historicly correct to a point. But the music and the the place that it was inserted in the film was not. The element that was missing most in this film was the true character of Alan Freed. He was the most accessibile of dee jays, he had a rapport with teenagers that in the two films done about him was never truly explored.
In true Hollywood fasion, his marriage to Jackie was embellished while his second wife Inga was never mentioned, though they briefly made reference to a possible affair played by Paula Abdul.
The film was a trip back down memory lane, but did not score as it could have. The performers that played the legends of rock n roll were for the most part bland and uninspired.
If you were to edit both this movie and American Hot Wax together you might have made a quality motion picture.
All in all it was enjoyable, but unfulfilling when trying to capture the true essence of a young jewish man, whose parents had disowned him due to his career choice and the troubled soul, that had an aim in life and carried it through only to be thrown to the wolves by cowards who had agendas that were in keeping with the times.
I enjoyed the trip down memory lane and the movie is well worth a look, but not one that I could watch over and over. To hear true stories about Alan Freed and the music he played go to [...]",1265414400,8,1913,4.258241758241758
