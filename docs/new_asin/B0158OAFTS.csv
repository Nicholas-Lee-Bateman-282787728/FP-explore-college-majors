7430369,5,B0158OAFTS,"I will be buying this one on its release day. I enjoy watching my kids watching these great old cartoons. I don't recommend this unless you have small kids but if yo do then buy it, your children will be entertained for hours on end.",1148688000,4,233,4.2
7430370,5,B0158OAFTS,"I normally wouldn't review a DVD that won't be released for three months, but this is one I've been looking forward to since Hanna Barbera began issuing its classic cartoons on DVD. When I was a kid, I enjoyed seeing how much trouble Magilla could get into each Saturday morning. During the past few years I've seen a few episodes on Boomerang and the Cartoon Channel. I was glad to see that the humor and heart-warming plots still come across as charming rather than boring.

An earlier review states what is on this set, so there is no need for me to repeat that information. If you enjoyed Magilla when you were young, these shows will bring wonderfully silly memories. If you missed these the first go round or were born too late, you are in for a treat. The animation is simple, but effective, and the music outstanding. The theme song is a classic, right up there with the Flinstones. Take my advice, at any price, a gorilla like Magilla is mighty nice, Magilla Gorilla for sale on DVD.",1147996800,6,992,4.511111111111111
7430371,5,B0158OAFTS,"Kids' show hosts in the early '60s had a problem. They could only show so many cartoon shorts in what was, essentially, a kids' variety program, and Hanna-Barbera, which made the best TV cartoons, only offered their shows to networks in half-hour formats. That was until 1962, when H-B syndicated ""Wally Gator"", ""Touche Turtle"", and ""Lippy the Lion"" shorts, enabling local networks to run individual cartoons. In 1964, The Magilla Gorilla Show was also locally syndicated first, although it later relaunched on ABC. Later the ""Richochet Rabbit"" segment moved over to the new Peter Potamus Show, ""Breezly and Sneezly"" from that series sliding into the vacated spot.

Both series were developed for and sponsored by Ideal Toys (and have the word and logo of ""Ideal"" in the theme song), and in 1966, both joined ABC's Saturday morning line-up. This DVD set captures all 23 episodes of the first Magilla Show on four one-sided discs, with the supporting ""Richochet Rabbit"" and ""Mushmouse and Punkinpuss"" segments. It's been pointed out that the catchy opening theme is missing, although it plays behind the onscreen menu, as are the closing credits. This is ironic, as one of the special features on disc three shows Hoyt Curtin and Bill Hanna playing and singing the memorable song.

Also on disc three are seven extra Magilla 'toons, probably from the later batch, which were aired until 1967, and an odd bit called ""Peebles Petshop"". This opens onto a picture of Magilla's well-known home with arrows here and there. Clicking on an arrow launches a mini video, usually with animation historian Jerry Beck, and some with Magilla voice actor Allan Melvin. There's even one on Chugga-Chugga, the pet shop dachsund and a recurring character. On disc four there's another extra Magilla cartoon, and a 1964 black and white TV special, ""Here Comes a Star"" made for local stations to run prior to the show's debut. Everyone seems very stiff, as if they have stage fright, but they air an entire Magilla Gorilla cartoon. Here you do see the opening song segment, but it's in black and white.

The theme song cavil aside, this is a pretty good set, and a great chance for H-B fans and animation buffs to see lots of classic cartoons for not much coin. The Boomerang channel and the show of the same name on Cartoon Network showed some of these shows, along with lots of other classic retro H-B 'toons. Hopefully more Boomerang favorites are ahead, like Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy, Squiddly Diddly, and Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space. When Scooby Do made DVD, kids took to it like a new show, and made the DVDs best sellers. Look how many ""new"" shows in the Hanna-Barbera roster yet remain to debut on DVD.",1146787200,9,2705,4.838012958963283
7430372,5,B0158OAFTS,"This was an Hanna-Barbera cartoon collection that started in 1964. The title cartoon is about a Gorilla that nobody wants to buy and the nearly broke pet store owner, Mr. Peebles.

So here's the weird piece of trivia - Magilla Gorilla's voice is Allan Melvin, the guy who played Sam the Butcher on ""The Brady Bunch."" Mr. Peebles was voiced by Howard Morris who played Ernest T Bass on the ""Andy Griffith Show."" Howard also directed some of my favorite ""Hogan's Heroes"" episodes.

The other two cartoons are Ricochet Rabbit (a rabbit version of Quickdraw McGraw) and the hillbilly cat and mouse toon Punkin' Pus.

There should be plenty of odd extras with the show's opening and endings.  Earl Kress is reporting these among the bonus features:
Here Comes A Star - A 1963 Half-Hour Special that was used to introduce the show to the world. It is hosted by George Fenniman (Groucho Marx's announcer from You Bet Your Life), who talks to Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera. It's in B&W and is particularly interesting because it shows the then newly constructed H-B studio at 3400 Cahuenga Blvd. in Hollywood.

Ogee and Magilla win the big prize while Hector and his crazy dog wind up in second with the trophy getting placed on his dog's head. I always enjoyed Magilla Gorilla and he is one of the funniest characters that William Hanna and Joseph Barbera created.

7430416,3,B0158OAFTS,"I don't feel too bad since I bought it for $5.99 at Newbury Comics. I also read some of the reviews and agree w/ the missing theme songs on the opening & closing credits. Some of the episodes looked very poor quality and no attempt to clean them up. Were they in a rush when creating this package. Ok so I got the bad review out of the way. On w/ the rest of review. Magilla Gorilla episodes I haven't seen in years even Boomerang! seem to be playing more 90's cartoons so this was a good opportunity to purchase this DVD for $6. Plus Ricochet Rabbit was cool episodes I didn't know they were part of Magilla Gorilla series. As a kid I remember tv showing Ricochet Rabbit, Wally Gator and Touche Turtle in a half hour episodes.
So the missing theme songs and poor quality of some episodes made this a lower rating.

Have a question I purchased a few new Hanna-Barbera DVDs such as Huckleberry Hound, Top Cat, Scooby Doo and each DVD package came w/ an animated cell. Wondering did Magilla Gorilla come w/ a cell?",1401148800,,1012,4.326315789473684

One of the highlights of the set is ""Makin' with the Magilla"", a nod to the surfing crowd with a catchy little tune by Little Eva of ""The Loco-Motion"" fame.
It doesn't bother me that the theme song is missing from the individual shows. It doesn't bother me that some of the images are not perfect.

one of the better upbeat openings which also introduced Ricochet Rabbit and

It's too bad that this DVD release didn't receive the amount of restoration it truly deserved. The opening Magilla Gorilla theme song and closing segments are missing and that's a major disappointment.

The video transfer of the various cartoons varies in quality from good to poor. It's obvious from the video quality that this was a rush job by Warner Studios in an effort to quickly release this show on DVD. The quality of this release is well below the standard of the other Hanna Barbera release's currently being sold, but I'm still glad I can add it to my collection.

Despite the issues I have raised regarding the level of quality, I'm sure fans will still want to own this set. Magilla Gorilla the Complete Series 4 disc set contains all 23 episodes from the show plus another 8 bonus shorts. The four single sided discs are well done and come with great artwork and packaging. Come on and join Mr Peebles and Magilla Gorilla today!

DVD Features:
- Magilla Gorilla theme song, live and unplugged: rare footage of Hoyt Curtin and Bill Hanna at the piano, introduced by series animator Jerry Eisenberg
- Mr. Peebles pet shop: interactive interview gallery with Magilla Gorilla voice Allan Melvin, series animator Jerry Eisenberg and animation historian Jerry Beck
- Here comes a star: archival TV special goes inside Hanna-Barbera studios to introduce this new simian character",1156118400,9,1565,4.853932584269663
7430469,3,B0158OAFTS,"First of all, let me say that I am thankful to WB video for these box sets of cartoons. Many of them, particularly the early sets, have been done top notch. That, however, is not the case with this recent release. As usual, it does not take long for WB to start cutting back on the products after the initial blush is gone. The early Flintstones, Jetsons and Top Cat offerings featured startlingly beautiful prints and somewhat interesting extras, but this poor Magilla set is clearly a real cut-rate job. The set does have all the cartoons made for the series, grouped as shows, (curiously with a few cartoons added as special features with no explanation as to why they were not included grouped as part of the shows). There are no opening or closing title sequences or original credits provided either. And a number of the cartoons in the set are sub-standard, grainy, dirty, scratched, high contrast prints, which in this day and age, is inexcusable particularly for WB. The extra materials are bare bones on this set and, though I don't blame the dedicated people who work very hard to put these sets together or who appear in interviews, (layout artist and show designer Jerry Eisenberg, Animation historian Jerry Beck and Magilla voice Allan Melvin provide short but insightful comments). I still would have hoped for more information on the show's conception and production or at the very least complete, accurate credits. The show was very cute and well executed for television during the heyday of Hanna Barbera cartoon production in the mid 1960s. But, with the exception of the earlier produced Ricochet Rabbit and Pumpkin Puss & Mush Mouse cartoons (which are funny and hold up surprisingly well with good writing and great performances particularly by Mel Blanc and Howard Morris), lacks the sophistication and luster of the shows that preceded it such as the prime time shows and Huckleberry Hound. This show was not nearly as entertaining as Quick Draw McGraw, (to me one of the studios best efforts) and it is a mystery as to why the powers that be at Warners Video would opt to offer Magilla over Quickdraw to begin with. But that is taste and the distributor's prerogative. In the end, this set is not terrible, just disappointing and would still be great for the kiddies. But, as a serious presentation of the series for collection or study, I am sorry to say this falls below the standards set by earlier H & B sets.",1156118400,20,2437,4.763593380614657
7430470,1,B0158OAFTS,"Yes, Warner Home Video has admitted that they goofed, they forgot the opening & closing titles that has the famous theme song!  They also forgot the in-between bridging material that introduced the next cartoon.  Then there is the fair quality film transfer of the cartoons.  No restoration here!

Warner Home Video MAY re-master the discs IF there is a demand for it.  I say demand it!

Besides this fact the image is awful, this set looks more like to was produced by a budget company that usually sells discs for 1 dollar.

8733004,3,B0158OAFTS,"MAGILLA GORILLA:  Hanna-Barbera's first ""funny animal"" series to exclude the voice talents of Daws Butler, pet store dweller Magilla was portrayed with goofy glee by TV character actor Allan Melvin (a Sgt. Bilko, Gomer Pyle, Brady Bunch regular). The ""bored captive critter longing for excitement in the outside world"" was a standard HB theme also used in Yogi Bear, Wally Gator and Squiddley Diddley, while Richochet Rabbit's spoof of the wild west was a lot funnier when Quick Draw McGraw did it. Even Punkin Puss & Mush Mouse was merely a hick variation on Tom & Jerry/Pixie & Dixie. The voice cast included veterans Don Messick and Mel Blanc, plus Howard Morris, who played Magilla's long suffering owner Mr. Peebles and gave Mush Mouse his patented ""Ernest T. Bass"" delivery. Perhaps the single best component of The Magilla Gorilla Show was its jaunty singalong theme, which originally incorporated the show's sponsor Ideal into the lyrics. While not on the same league as classics like Huckleberry Hound, Yogi, and Quick Draw, Magilla Gorilla is nonetheless a fondly remembered part of the Hanna-Barbera empire.
