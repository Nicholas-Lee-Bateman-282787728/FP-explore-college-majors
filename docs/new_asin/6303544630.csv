674809,3,6303544630,"This movie was not meant to be ""scary.""  It is more of a suspense movie with a plot that causes many sex scenes to take place.  That is the type of movie it is.  If you like that type of movie, go for it.  You will get your fill.  If you want a suspenseful horror flick (with less  sex), try one of my personal favorites,""the Unholy.""  It is a  lesser known movie that will definitely be worth a look.",954374400,6,401,3.9873417721518987

7849635,4,6303544630,"This movie is much better than I thought it would be.  It doesn't have a great deal of depth but it's a better than average study of human relations at a base level.  Many ""B"" movies have awkward endings but this film ties up all the ""wonder what happened?"" sensations .I think it's worth your time to take a look.",1516838400,,314,4.216666666666667

7849637,2,6303544630,"This one is a little difficult to figure out if I liked it or not. One the one hand, there was a lot of sex and plenty of Ts as well as A, and none of them were half bad. However, on the other hand, I thought I was sitting down to a nice afternoon horror show. It was kind of like going out and stopping for lunch at the beach and ordering a chili dog, medium rare cheeseburger, hot french fries and a fountain coke, and then waiter brings you filet mignon, lobster tails, creamed spinach and chardonnay. I like the surf 'n turf a lot but, I am at the beach and my belly was all set for a chili dog, and that's what I would have preferred in that situation.

Sometimes surprises are not good. So keep in mind, this is not a horror film, nor is it scary. It is the closets thing to soft-core porn that I have ever seen on Amazon. The acting is not great, but that is of little relevance in these genres. I even think it had a plot, but I couldn't tell you anything about that. The girls are cute and well-proportioned and the guys are ok. the stories they tell are provocative and stimulating, but not in the early afternoon. So use appropriately",1514419200,7,1145,4.111607142857143

7849641,1,6303544630,"To find this slow-paced film ""erotic"", you'd have to have been recently released from some Middle East sexually-repressed regime.  It seems aimed towards over-40 Bible Belt types. (...)",1005868800,3,185,5.607142857142857
7849642,1,6303544630,"Scenario: Friend wanted a movie with sex and I wanted a horror movie. Compromise: Stormswept...supposed to be erotic horror
Result: We were both disappointed...very disappointed.
The basic premise of the movie is that a group of people end up in a creepy old mansion which is haunted by a ghost that periodically takes over members of the group and thereby causes them to get extremely horny. Sounds intriguing but it is absolutely awful!!! This is as scary as a Disney movie...aside from the creepy house, nothing is remotely frightening. The erotic/sex part of the movie is anything but erotic or even arousing. The picture quality is bad, the acting is worse, and the plot is the worst. Stay away from this wretched flick!!!",999129600,5,727,4.91869918699187
7849643,4,6303544630,"This movie is interesting in the moods that it sets for the viewer.  Several people end up staying in a mansion to ride out a storm.  Meanwhile, they are sequentially possessed by a spirit that makes them horny.  Best looking collection of babes I've seen in a long time.  Acting not as bad as expected, actually it's pretty good.  My wife loved this movie.  The horror elements are barely noticable, but I didn't mind because it more than makes up for what it lacks.  After seeing mine a girlfriend of ours had me order her a copy. The only thing bringing this down from 5 stars is the video and audio are both a little below average but the movie is great erotic mindless entertainment.  Highly recommended to the right audience.",993427200,12,731,4.526717557251908
