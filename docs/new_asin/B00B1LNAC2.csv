They come home not believing because of a Prof. with a PHD. who teaches the big bang and evolution as a fact - claiming all the REAL scientists believe in evolution and the big bang. Not True. I always think of Richard Feynman PHD, at Cal Tech. He is considered to be the foremost Prof. of Physics in the world. ( He said REAL science is believing in the ignorance of the experts,) Jay Seegert has shown the other side of the discussion, Using solid science he shows that much of todays science points to a young earth - a creator - and a flood  that was the cause of a large part of what we see in the world today. Science is proving God! This is in plain English. I am sure you will watch this more then once and then loan it to friends. Jake",1441152000,,805,4.062893081761007
