Does anyone know how to contact the people that edit the pages to see if it's just a goof having two seperate pages or however many there are, or if they are selling them seperately? I really want to make sure I'm getting the right thing. I couldn't have only one thing, that would suck!",1139961600,,349,4.147058823529412
