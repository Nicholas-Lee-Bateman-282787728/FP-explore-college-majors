This movie contains the actor Jonathen Winters.  The movie with those actor's is actually named ""Gone Fishin'"" and not ""Gone fishing"".",1082332800,10,265,4.717391304347826

7910280,1,B00000IC52,"First, let me say that I am an avid movie goer, and my list of favorite films is a mixture of high quality and not-so-high quality flicks.
However,  sitting through this movie was a struggle.  The first  barrage of unfunny jokes and 'amusing incidents' were ample portent of what  was to come.  The fact that the entire theater around my wife and I sat  through this in stunned silence says it all.
Joe Pesci and Danny Glover  are talented people. Why they decided to set sail in this cinematic Bermuda  Triangle is anybody's guess.
