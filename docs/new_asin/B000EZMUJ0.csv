I use these to show to my students in class. Good work. I was looking one on Jainism, a religion from India. But could not find one. They don't have it or I did not find it? I guess they did not produce one.
I think they must produce one. Does any one have any contacts with them?? Are they active now, producing more such stuff?? Any thing new coming up for my student?",1322611200,,374,4.0

Amazon, please carry the DVD version of this.",1290124800,,160,4.3
8115960,5,B000EZMUJ0,"I am a retired professor who taught World Religion courses for 38 years.  During that time I reviewed and sometimes utilized most of the English language series on this subject. Ronald Eyre's ""The Long Search"" was far and away the best of them all. I totally agree with Pat about the empathetic manner in which Ron Eyre treated each religion.  The hundreds of students who watched the series over the years(I could only use nine of the thirteen episodes due to time constraints) were captivated by his authenticity and respect for each religion. Most other world religion videos are primarily of the ""talking heads"" format and don't give the viewer the insight that comes from Mr. Eyre's intimate conversations with devotees of the religion being presented.

I agree that in the increasingly interconnected 21st century a study of the major religions of the world is essential for every high school and college student.  Prejudice because of ignorance, and the demonizing of other cultures because of their religious beliefs has led our nation into unfortunate wars and political upheavals.

Perhaps A & E, the History Channel, or PBS will once again make this series widely available outside the classroom.  We can only hope that Ronald Eyre's ""The Long Search"" will attain the legacy it richly deserves in our century.",1231459200,4,1320,5.032110091743119

I teach Religious Studies at college and have used several of these episodes to bring religion to life for my students. They work so well because the host, Ronald Eyre, doesn't know much about religion but he keeps his eyes open and his attitude positive through all he sees. So we like him and we really learn as he asks just the sort of questions we would. Though the series is old (1977), it's now on DVD and might look much better than the VHS version (which is not bad). I hope it appears on Amazon soon (note that it *is* available elsewhere online).

In the meantime, at a time when understanding religions is more vital than it ever has been, I urge everyone to look for this series at your public libraries.",1178668800,4,891,4.426829268292683
8115962,5,B000EZMUJ0,"It was many years ago now - probably back in the late 1970's or early 1980's - that I watched this excellent 13 part series from the BBC, on our Australian equivalent - the ABC TV- for the first time. I remember being profoundly impressed by the manner in which the subject of our worldwide religions was approached by the ever likeable series presenter, the affable, intelligent, respectful, considerate and humurous Ronald Eyre. Sadly, I learned earlier this year from the BBC, when enquiring into Ronald Eyre's latest works, that he had passed away in 1992, some 15 years after the series was completed. This review therefore is as much a tribute to Ronald Eyre for his successful undertaking of ""The Long Search"", as it is of the series itself. Ronald Eyre, very much the quintessential English gentleman, replete in his tailored suits in the tropics of Sri Lanka, India, Taiwan and Sulawesi, Indonesia, took us all on a journey of a lifetime in television documentary making - never by the way to be repeated or equalled again - where he asked those very same questions about life, death, the religious experience, and the meaning of life that we all ask ourselves during our lives. His respect for all those he spoke to, whether they were Fundamentalist Christians in the U.S.A. or Buddhists from Sri Lanka, meant the atmosphere of mutual tolerance was all pervasive. The deliberate 'blurring' of religious imagery, experience, theology and belief, with secular interests in Science and pursuits that give people meaning in their lives, gave the series the balanced, open ended question and answer format intended it from the outset, rather than the usual more instructional and definite process. Ronald Eyre gave us no concrete answers but he never intended to. However, the questions he asked, and the people he asked those questions of made the series truly fascinating.  All episodes in the series are of a superb standard but for me ""The Way Of The Ancestors"", a study of animist beliefs in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ""East Meets West"", alternative lifestyles in California, and the concluding episode of ""Loose Ends: Reflections On The Long Search"" are the standout episodes.  I know this review will most likely not be read by too many people but I truly can't speak highly enough of the value this series has given to me personally,  and I believe to the realms of TV religious documentary making. Unfortunately, the films are now rather dated and the colour grainy but let that not put you off. I hope sometime in the future the series will be shown on TV again and give another generation of viewers the value and delight it gave me.  Thankyou Ronald Eyre and the BBC.

Vale Ronald Eyre.

P.S. Carl Davis' theme music from the series is melancholy and moving and well suited to the series.",1177459200,19,2799,4.8574423480083855
