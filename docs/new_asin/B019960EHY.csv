7565630,5,B019960EHY,"I had seen this movie advertised and assumed it was a kids movie because of its name. I have to say I was wrong. This is a bloody adult action movie straight out of the 1980's. I heard a lot of people mention that its low budget. Yes it is low budget but it is done with class. This director did what he could with the limited resources he had and made a brilliant movie. If you love those action movies from the 80's, then I am sure you will love this as well. The acting was good, and the lead characters were likable. Hollywood should give this guy some money to make a more budget worthy movie, because he definitely deserves it. If he can make a magic film such as this on a shoe string budget, I can only imagine what he can do with more money. Overall, this is not a kids movie, but a movie for adults who grew up during the 80's, or just love the decade.",1461024000,,862,4.017441860465116

It made me feel the same as the first time I saw MadMax 30 years ago......, instantly back to the 80's, many memories of that time.

A film with original argument, that pays homage to genre films  liked and inspired over the years.

Thank you very much to the producers and actors of this movie, to me is wonderful and rewarding.",1472256000,2,358,4.298507462686567
