8427256,3,B004EO4HKM,"This is a home-video of a workshop conducted in a small office with folks sitting on folding chairs around a table.  Audio and video are marginal.  Videographer attempt to pan the room about drove me nuts! OK, deal with it.  Content concepts are useful, transferable.  And, actually, this is where the value should be, not in fancy production or in entertaining stories told (there are none).  The specific book and website he mentioned are not useful, but better grantor material can be gotten from the on-line database from The Foundation Center - they have a presence in libraries in every state.  For the price, it is a good value IF you listen carefully and do what he says.  He is with a household name organization, and so has a less difficult job than what you or I might have, but claims to be productive for his effort.",1364774400,,829,4.598639455782313
