1726655,5,B000068QJY,"This is a very funny movie, especially if you like twisted comedies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison.  Also if you like Kids in the Hall and the Simpsons because two of the writers are guys from those shows.  In some ways, this movie is a bizarro retelling of the Fugitive movie and TV series with lots of clever jokes.  My favorite part is when Foley's character gets caught in a feud between the local banker and a small town farmer--but with a very unexpected twist.  This movie will make you laugh.",1032912000,,506,4.467391304347826
1726656,5,B000068QJY,"What I love about the ""Wrong Guy"" is its twisted sense of humor--which you expect from Dave Foley who was in Kids in the Hall.  It is also written by David Higgins (from the ELLEN show and Higgins Boys & Gruber) and Jay Kogen (who wrote a lot of the best Simpsons episodes from the early seasons).  The premise is essentially ""What if you thought you were wanted for murder but nobody was chasing you?""  What starts as a broad farce evolves into a clever satire of The Fugitive movie and TV series.  There is one hilarious joke that creeps up on you when Foley finds himself caught in a classic feud between a farmer and the local bank while hiding out in a small town.  Buy it now and laugh.",1032825600,,692,4.251908396946565
1726657,5,B000068QJY,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen, and has made me a big Dave Foley fan.  You have to watch this movie carefully since the jokes are everywhere.",1029369600,,154,4.133333333333334
1726718,5,B000068QJY,"I don't know how I missed this film when it first came out.  I just saw it recently on DVD and it is hilarious.  If you are a fan of ""Kids in the Hall"" it is a great send up of the classic Hitchcock/noir ""wrong man"" story but with the inept David Foley in the lead role.  This film has a lot of humor in it and there are several great roles including the police detective that are just hilarious.",1376870400,,396,3.925
1726719,5,B000068QJY,I don't know what it is about this actor but I just adore him.  This movie is a silly comedy that I saw on television on a few years ago.  One day not long ago I remembered it and ordered that afternoon after researching to find out the title.  It is one of those movies you have to suspend belief to enjoy but it has lots of little goody scenes that just make me laugh.  It has a 79% approval rate on the net's most popular movie review site which is pretty telling I think.,1364083200,,475,3.968421052631579
1726720,4,B000068QJY,"In 2013 the premise sounds a lot more enjoyable than the film is to watch. If I had seen this in 1997, maybe it would have come across more strongly than it does now (I'd never watched it before). The tone seems strangely uneven; the actual murder story line is laid out in the straight forward way it would have been in a mid-budget 90s thriller, and Colm Feore's killer basically stays in that movie while the comic characters take off into more zany films. Those zanier elements have some ideas that are still hilarious, but there aren't as many of these as I'd hoped for. It's great that this movie recklessly subverts conventions, but those subversions don't always payoff into sustained laughs. For example, the disengaged cop who follows his hunches to shows and restaurants gets a big laugh when his plan becomes clear, but after that point, there are rapidly diminishing returns on the joke.",1363305600,,900,4.738853503184713
1726721,5,B000068QJY,"THIS MOVIE IS LIKE FINDING A MOVIE CALLED ""BLAZING SADDLES"" NO ONE EVER HEARD OF BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER RELEASED.

This is a very funny film. I heard Dave Foley on some Podcast (Joe Rogan?) say he felt it was his best work. What happened is the studio which stood behind it either was bought out or went bankrupt,then was purchased by Disney who forgot they owned it. That is why it took years for it too even be released on DVD!

 You may notice that this film is not low budget. It also has a big time director  David Steinberg and a solid cast of Jennifer Tilly,David Anthony Higgins, Joe Flaherty and Colm Feore SIC (The really bad guy from Stephen Kings TV movie ""Storm of the Century""). They all do a great job, especially David Anthony Higgins.

This is very well written film which was supposed to launch David Foley into the movie business. Dave Foley pulled off his end,and so did everybody else involved. The studio just screwed them completely.

If you like anything Dave Foley has done as a comic actor, well this is better and funnier.",1357776000,,1047,4.455497382198953
1726722,5,B000068QJY,"If you like kinda stupid, yet very clever, clean humor then this movie is a must see. I caught it on TV one day and laughed so hard I had to buy it. I've seen it about 10 times and still makes me laugh, and I catch something new every time I watch it.",1356739200,,251,3.6666666666666665

1726724,5,B000068QJY,"Heard about this movie when Dave Foley guested on Joe Rogan's podcast, and decided to give it a shot. It's hilarious. I can't remember the last time I almost cried laughing during a movie. I can see myself re-watching this one many times. So many brilliant lines and sight gags. A perfect feel-good movie.",1300579200,2,305,4.666666666666667
1726725,4,B000068QJY,"I really like this movie, it is often very funny, a really wacky film. Too bad Dave Foley didn't get the chance to keep making films, he shows great potential here and I wish he could have built up some momentum with it.

But about the DVD: There is a Lion's Gate Home Entertainment edition that includes a very good commentary by Dave Foley with the directory and producer. This edition is in full frame though. The colours are dull and washed out too. You can identify it by the cover picture of Foley in a police lineup with four other guys. I believe that this is the Canadian edition.

The other edition, which I understand is the American one and is put out by Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment looks great. It's sharp, bright and in widescreen (1.85:1), which seems to be the intended aspect ratio. There's no commentary though which is a shame. This one has a picture of Foley alone on the cover.

Which one should you choose? If you really like Dave Foley, Kids in the Hall or any Canadian comedy shows for that matter, like Four on the Floor (Dan Redican appears) or SCTV (Joe Flaherty appears) get both copies and make your own complete two-disc set. That's what I did.",1288656000,10,1184,4.497674418604651
1726726,2,B000068QJY,"I bought this because I'm a huge Kids in the Hall fan and I read all the good reviews. But, I just didn't find it to be very funny. Put it this way, I was content to watch it, but I didn't laugh once. Who am I though? You might find it to be the funniest movie ever. I just recommend that you rent it before you decide to purchase.",1288310400,,331,3.742857142857143
1726727,5,B000068QJY,Such a hilarious movie!  Dave Foley is a brilliant actor and makes almost anything funny.  Could watch this movie over and over again.  Received movie in great condition and time. ^_^,1280448000,,183,4.838709677419355
1726781,5,B000068QJY,"I bought this movie on video more than 10 years ago, and it remains one of my favorite silly comedies.  It is absurd and ridiculous, and absolutely hilarious.  I'm finally making the move from VHS to DVD, because I can't stand not being able to watch this on my updated, VHS-less entertainment system.

First off, nobody I know has even heard of this movie.  I'm not sure how *I* even heard of it, but I'm glad I did.  The movie, written by Dave Foley, David Anthony Higgins and Jay Kogen, joins Foley's character, Nelson Hibbert, on his run from the law after his boss and future father-in-law is found dead. Nelson, who is innocent, but threatened to kill his boss in front of a dozen witnesses, flees from the cops and begins a journey of epic failure.  Little does he know, the cops have no idea who is he, and are on to the real killer.  Without giving too much away, Nelson and the real killer follow a startlingly similar path, followed by a lazy cop, finding love, intrigue and malicious farmers along the way.

The movie is just plain funny.  The cop is more concerned with finding a hooker and a good steak than finding the killer.  Nelson continually gets himself into awkward situations. His love interest continually falls asleep.  The writing is sharp, the sight-gags are funny.  Do yourself a favor and check this movie out, it's really terrific.

I've been quoting various things from this movie since I saw it, in the late '90s.  Too bad nobody else ever gets the references. :\",1258070400,,1495,4.571428571428571
1726782,5,B000068QJY,"This was the funniest movie I've ever seen.  It is good for almost any age.  It makes a great gift because many people have not seen it, I don't know why that is because it is an excellent flick.",1227484800,,195,3.9743589743589745
1726783,4,B000068QJY,"This movie is terrible- I love it!!!!!!!!!  My husband and I are rather movie cynical and embarked upon this adventure with a lot of hesitance.  We found ourselves laughing- this is worth a one time viewing by anyone who liked The Kids in the Hall, and I intend to own it.  It's a great Saturday afternoon movie, dumb and clever all at once.  Dave Foley rocks...",1214006400,2,362,4.4393939393939394
1726784,5,B000068QJY,"If you liked ""Dumb and Dumber,"" this movie may be just the ticket.",1181692800,,66,4.153846153846154
1726785,5,B000068QJY,"Dave has a good, paranoid time where ever he goes while running from the law in a case of mistaken (?) identity.  The memories that flood back from the sombrerro picture...ahhh.  If you like Dave (even a little bit) you will love this movie.",1179705600,,241,4.454545454545454
1726786,5,B000068QJY,"I gave this movie top rating for two reasons: Colm Feore and David Anthony Higgins.

 Foley is cute though not consistently funny (some of his material felt a bit forced to me, ) however, there were many laugh-out-loud scenes that nearly had me strangled ( feeding on forest food, jumping the train, getting water at the filling station, ALL interactions with the Killer, and many more..)  His fugitive flight puts him into contact with several off-key characters, and the poor guy keeps running into one piece of bad luck or bad timing again and again. For the life of me I kept thinking, "" That's exactly MY luck.."" ( mine and all the OTHER ""ordinary guys"" out there...) Joe Flaherty's character of the bank owner shares the same fate as George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life (with slight comic variations,) and Jennifer Tilley is adorable and alluring as ever as Foley's narcoleptic girlfriend.

 Higgins' romp through the states using the FBI's ""unlimited resources"" is hilarious. ( If the name does not ring a bell, you may remember him from the old ""Ellen"" show - he worked at the book store's coffee shop, Cup-a-Joe's, and served more comic relief than lattes.) He tracks his fugitive through some of the country's best restaurants, strip clubs and Musical revues, ( ! )  while maintaining the integrity of his investigation.

The real scene stealer though is Colm. His Killer is brilliant. I loved the constant wardrobe changes( best scene? the surgeon ) and the magical coincidences that kept bringing him into contact with Foley. His Killer is single-minded, militant in his mission, and seemingly superhuman, ( some of the Killer's escapes are very John Woo, but...soooo funny ) It is hard to explain but there is a humor about this character that is hard to ignore and impossible not to love.. The best moments in the movie belong to Colm and his straight-faced delivery of some of its funniest lines...( after all the Killer puts himself through it is wonderfully ironic to hear him whine at the end "" I fell on my keys!) There are dozens of scenes that I would love to talk about but I don't want to ruin the laughs for those who have not seen the flick.

I can't guarantee that everyone will find this movie as entertaining as some, but I CAN bet that if you buy it you will not feel badly that you did.

Best regards...",1176940800,3,2336,4.664233576642336
1726787,5,B000068QJY,This movie is possibly Dave Foley at his finest. It's comedy that can be appreciated by anyone,1174694400,2,94,4.588235294117647
1726788,1,B000068QJY,"Watch out - make sure you are buying the widescreen version and not the so-called ""fullscreen"" version - I have submitted a product update and hopefully Amazon will fix this so nobody else gets stuck with a lousy ""fullscreen"" DVD unless they are stupid enough to prefer that.",1165017600,,275,4.75
1726789,5,B000068QJY,"This movie has been out for about 10 years, but is now recently more available on DVD.  Dave Foley plays Niel, a banking executive that thinks he is going to be the next company president at his firm, but suddenly has his life turned upside down when his boss chooses someone else...and then ends up dead. Now what's funny about this plot so far, nothing, but as with many of the gang from the kids in the hall, it just happens.  Niel discovers the body of his boss, and in shock, he ends up contaminating the whole crime scene with evidence that he did the murder, so he takes off and runs away as a fugitive, heading for mexico.  As you've may figure out, he plays a very simple guy, not the brightest star in the sky. What he never realized is that the bosses office was videotaped, and they have the real killer on film and police are after him, and have no interest in Niel.  But, fate has him crossing paths with the real killer throughout the movie, and not once does the simple niel ever read the paper or actually watch tv to find out he's not really wanted.  You just have to watch it. If you like brain candy and the kids in the hall, then this movie should be right up your alley. At least rent it if you can, but I suggest buying it, its hilarious.",1162512000,,1261,4.194214876033058
1726790,4,B000068QJY,"This movie is quite entertaining, containing several former kids in the hall cast members in Cameo appearences, and of course, Dave Foley in the lead role.  As Nelson Hibbert, a man who thinks he has been accused of his bosses murder, Foley takes on a cross country fleeing spree that leads him from Ohio to Texas heading for Mexico to live there awaiting for a way to clear his name...even though there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Of course, they parallel him with the real killer which further makes Nelson Hibbert think he is more guilty when the cops keep showing up where he is.  Take the time, rent this, buy it for cheap (5.99 at a local retailer for me, well worth it).  If you liked braincandy, similar humor.  Try it, you'll like it for it's cornyness.",1152748800,2,772,4.525179856115108
1726821,5,B000068QJY,"I've seen it 3 times already, and found it just as funny the 3rd time as I did the 1st.",1140048000,2,87,3.4
1726822,4,B000068QJY,"This movie is inspired and funny, chock full of great gags, one right after another.  The premise, about an idiot who thinks he's being chased by the law when the police already know who the real killer is, is pure genius.  But like any movie the real fun comes in the execution.

Dave Foley is perfect as the clueless Nelson, on the run for a crime he didn't commit from the law that doesn't care about him.  There's tons of terrific jokes and nearly every one is dead on.  The supporting cast is full of great actors who deliver their absurd lines with deadpan accuracy.

It's a shame the movie didn't recieve a wide release in the theaters because it certainly deserved it.  Well worth renting or, even better, buying.

Watch the credits to listen for two great songs:  one from the fictional musical ""Moby!"", and a pitch perfect sendup of 50s doowop by none other than the Bare-Naked Ladies.",1129507200,2,895,4.54375
1726823,4,B000068QJY,"I remember seeing this movie years ago, and it always stuck in my head to find it on DVD someday.  So logically, my brain must've thought it was funny.

1726824,3,B000068QJY,"Dave Foley (Kids In The Hall, Sky High) stars in this comedy about a man who doesnt get a promotion and winds up thinking he killed his boss and that everyone is after him in which case they are not. The real killer, played by Colm Feore (Storm Of The Century, Highwaymen) was payed by the new guy who just stepped into the deceased boss' chair to kill him. Foley goes on a frantic run around getting into awkward situations, like eatting 10 tin cans of tainted meat, meeting a narcaleptic woman played by Jennifer Tilly (Seed Of Chucky, The Cat's Meow) and so on and so forth. the movie is really funny in a lot of parts. Foley's friend from Kids In The Hall Kevin McDonald (Senior Trip, Sky High) is in a funny cameo as a hotel clerk.

1726825,5,B000068QJY,"This movie is pretty mediocre with a generous peppering of moderately funny scenes.  It'll never be a cult classic or anything.  But there's one reason to own this movie:  Jennifer Tilly in a sheer nightgown.  Yowza.  It's in a dark room, but that doesn't matter.

1726827,4,B000068QJY,"When I sit through first 10 minutes, I rolled my eyes. All that affected screaming and ""funny"" faces the main character was making that were like bad parody of a french comedies from 70ties. Then I thought that maybe it is a low budget independednt film. In any case the movie got rolling after like 20 minutes and I laughed quite a lot. Yes the jokes are all predictable and cheasy, you wish the main character acts better, but all together it quite works. The movie doesn't try to be too serious about itself which is a bonus, but I think the main drawback is a dynamics. Sometimes the jokes play too long. It is like the main character needes to look surprised for 10 seconds while you need to have like 1 sec to get the joke.

Although, short on production value, and in some places acting ability (Jennifer Tilly) this movie is just another proof of Dave's subtle comic genius.
This movie is about a mild mannered, somewhat simple white-collar executive, trying to marry the boss's daughter to get a head in the company. Then upon finding his boss dead, just after vowing vengeance in front of the entire board room, Our hero (and I use that term lightly) freaks and runs, in the funniest most gruesome, and cowardly piece of comedy I've seen.

1726893,4,B000068QJY,"This is a movie that takes a comedy in a different direction where the funny parts are plain to see and David Foley outlines them with such a witless sense of serious drama that makes the film somewhat pointless in a very hillarious sort of way. Running into his dead boss, to tampering with the crime evidence, and trying to run from the cops, thinking there after him. From meeting the Narcoleptic girl, and the poor innocent banker who is getting ruined by a evil, rich, devilishly cunning farmer guy. This was a bit overdone perhaps. Everything about this movie is goofy, and brings out the best in David Foley and for all the fans that enjoy his dry sense of comedy and black comedy if you will. If you like David Foley.

In my opinion, this movie is less like a Hitchcock film and more like the great Buster Keaton chase comedies. The timing is perfect, Dave Foley's facial expressions are priceless and the dialogue is hilarious. There are a lot of repeated permutations on the ""wrongly accused"" storyline, and this movie takes probably the only one that hasn't been used yet (to my knowledge) and does a great job playing on the audience's expectations. On my first viewing I noticed that a lot of the great gags were ""reveal gags"", like the car alarms and the ham, which reminded me of the type of reveal gags used on The Simpsons (the three vase/closet gag in the Hugo episode is still one of my favorites). I was pleased to read that one of the writers was Jay Kogen. Jay, if you're not writing on The Simpsons any more, they need you badly. If you are, show some of those new guys how things are done.

The establishment of the main character's life and his initial dilemma actually require some patience.  Once his road trip begins, the most unpredictable absurd and screwball stuff begins.  The lead performance resembles a 30 year old Jim Carey or Chevy Chase.  Pay very close attention to the side characters.  Years before the Family Guy tv show, this script had some obscure references, inside jokes, and misunderstandings you could miss if you blink.  If this turns out to be your brand of comedy, also check out the little known Flirting With Disaster.",1488758400,,658,4.9363636363636365

7964690,2,B000068QJY,"In the long tradition of making fun of stupidity (Dumb & Dumber, The Jerk, ad nauseam) we have The Wrong Guy.  But there are a few things that make those films work which are absent here.  First, those protagonists are basically good, while this dweeb is only selfish.  Second, in those movies the idiot operates in a world that is otherwise filled with regular people so you can identify with them and appreciate their problems.  Here, many of the other characters are just as stupid as our hero.  Finally, good comedies have enough material that they don't have to milk the same tired joke over and over.  Such as the one about the wealthy farmers putting the bank out of business so they can tear it down and put up a cornfield.  Get it?  Yuck, yuck (for five minutes).  But, it could have been worse.  Jennifer Tilly's nightgown might have been opaque...",1477180800,,858,4.5855263157894735

7964693,5,B000068QJY,"THE WRONG GUY (Canada/UK-1997) is a favorite comedy that spoofs Hitchcock chase thrillers. Directed by David Steinberg, it stars scripter Dave Foley as a man who mistakenly believes he's being pursued for an in-office murder he didn't commit. Jennifer Tilly co-stars in hilarious fashion as a girl who suddenly falls asleep at the most inoportune moments, like when she's driving!

Also with Foley's co-writer David Anthony Higgins as a boob of a detective, plus Joe Flaherty, Alan Scarfe and Colm Feore as the real killer. BTW, Feore is actually hunting down Foley but his target doesn't know it. Colm feels this is necessary as he's convinced that Dave is following HIM and bringing along the cops. A real comedy of errors.

This is a genuinely funny movie and I most highly recommend it.

The ending of the film kind of drags. But up to that, this is genius comedy, a Canadian take on the Fugitive. Features a cameo by Kevin McDonald too.",1397865600,2,318,3.984375
