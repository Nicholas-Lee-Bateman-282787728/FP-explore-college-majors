8388869,3,B0035D2H82,"My son received this and several other DVD's in this series as a gift.  Based on the covers, I thought this was an animated series, but when I played the DVD for my son I was disappointed to find it is only a slideshow with narration.  My son liked the songs on the DVD, but was bored with the stories after a few minutes.",1278460800,,322,4.015625
