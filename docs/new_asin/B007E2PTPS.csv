5079329,4,B007E2PTPS,"I have Level 1 which got to be very routine for me,  I needed something more.  This is a very good workout but she goes a little too fast at some points to be able to follow the routine.  I am a fit 68 yr. old woman and would recommend this to those who have done some initial cardio exercises.  Mirabai is an excellent resource for staying in shape.",1356825600,10,350,4.028985507246377
8515066,4,B007E2PTPS,"This is a workout to get your heart pumping. However, I found it very hard to learn the routine, as i usually rotate my exercise videos, so haven't done this one with any consistency. If you don't mind messing up your steps and want to move, this is good. Easy on the knees.",1527206400,,274,4.188679245283019
8515067,4,B007E2PTPS,Its perfect for me being over 60 and not doing aerobics for awhile.  The dance makes it fun!  I'll be interested in the next level!,1518480000,,131,4.2
8515068,1,B007E2PTPS,"Great routine that combines cardio, dance and exercise moves.  Easy to follow and learn.  Good motivation and encouragement from Mirabai.",1463011200,,137,5.8
8515069,4,B007E2PTPS,"I can't follow the steps but at least I'm working out. And it should be at least a half an hour for cardio. All of it adds up to I think 23 minutes? oh well,",1457740800,,157,3.5142857142857142
8515070,3,B007E2PTPS,"This is basically a good workout video.  Caveats:  price is too high.  Only one workout that lasts 20 minutes (including the warm-up) and a 4-minute cool down.  No extras.  Also, Mirabai assumes viewers are familiar with the steps, so there is no instruction:  she calls out a step and immediately jumps into it, then rapidly on to the next step, giving the viewer no time to prepare for the next new step.  Also, as it states, this is definitely not for beginners because she moves too quickly from step to step.",1449878400,2,513,4.571428571428571
8515071,5,B007E2PTPS,"I like the way Holland paces her lessons. It's challenging for me, as I don't have a dance background and I'm an older woman who loves to move to music. The music is soothing, unobtrusive. The setting is on a beach somewhere. It almost feels like a meditation to move to this DVD. I use it to break up my sessions at my computer--it gets me moving and it's fun!",1417132800,,361,4.171428571428572
8515072,2,B007E2PTPS,"I'm 64 and it is too slow for me! Also, I really don't consider this a dance video.",1404691200,,83,3.6666666666666665
8515073,5,B007E2PTPS,This is a great workout for people over 55. The workout only takes 25 minutes to complete. The instructor makes it fun and easy.,1391385600,3,128,4.375
8515074,5,B007E2PTPS,"I like this exercise DVD because it is doable but still a challenge.
I like it because it is safe AND effective.
I like level 2 because it has some of the same moves as level 1 which gives me confindence but also has some fun new moves to make it interesting.
I like it because  - compared to level 1 - the intensity has increased but not the time.
I like the back ground music.
I like Mirabai.  The way she cues, her presentation, her knowledge, her motivation.
I like the way I feel after exercising using this DVD.
I would recommend it for any senior who wants to enjoy the health benefits consistant, safe, effective exercise can bring.
Thank you Mirabai.",1360627200,9,659,4.349593495934959
8515075,5,B007E2PTPS,"Because of some health problems I had been having some difficulty with walking and breathing.
I was hoping the dance exercise would help.  At first I had to stop between segments but now I can
Finnish the whole tape.  It has certainly helped me, so of course I like it very much.  The only fault I
Found is that Marabai's voice is a little soft in some places",1358812800,6,359,4.25
