7989649,1,B000095J5P,"I was trying to give it a zero stars.
Movie is in b&w.
There are vampire women but none are sexy. One scene a sexy woman walks around in her lingerie and that's it.
Santo's wrestling match is the only good thing in the movie.
Dracula actor is lame and looks like George Lazenby in a cape & tux.
No fight scene at all between Santo and Dracula.",1425945600,,343,4.0588235294117645
7989650,1,B000095J5P,"This movie seems great, except that I can't understand anything anyone's saying. That's because there's no subtitles. Luckily, I was able to download a subtitles file for it online, and even though the sync is off, they work more or less. So, after working on subtitling it with software for nearly 3 hours, it's done, and I can watch it (as a file on a USB stick) off my Bluray player. I could have torrented this and saved myself hours of effort. Buying a DVD generally means getting a film you can actually watch without utter confusion. Given the weird plot of this film, that would've been nice.",1415491200,,600,4.564814814814815
7989651,3,B000095J5P,"OK late 60's Mexican-made Spanish-language (English sub-titles available) Santo horror/action adventure.  Santo invents a time machine and sends his girlfriend back to the past to find out about some treasure and to be menaced by Dracula.  When she returns she brings the menace with her.  A bad guy in a black hood with a bunch of henchmen lurks in the background so he can get the inside scoop on the treasure.  Santo's sidekick is so nerdy, geeky and goofy one would think he alone would louse up Santo.  Not the best Santo movie, but then none of them is Academy Award material.  This film was originally in color, but apparently the only prints available are in black-and-white.  I have seen a color version on an Hispanic movie cable channel under the title El Vampiro y el Sexo, with some gratuitous female nudity available, but I don't think it's available on DVD.  Hopefully a good quality color version will be released soon.",1391817600,3,935,4.763975155279503

7989653,4,B000095J5P,"I really enjoyed this Santo flick.  There's just something about it that makes it one of the most fun Santo films I've seen to date.  I remember seeing a couple of the old dubbed ""Samson"" cheesefests on TV back in the 60's, but other than those, I'm relatively new to the genre.

First off, according to all sources, this film was shot in color.  This copy from Rise Above is in B&W, but it doesn't seem to detract from the enjoyment.  In fact, most of my favorite Santo films are the older B&W ones, so in a way, I feel the non-color aspect serves to enhance SANTO AND THE TREASURE OF DRACULA.  Also, the ""sleaze"" factor of a reported adult version of the film (with naked vampire babes!) is indeed missing from this edition.  I for one am glad.  I certainly have no objection to sleaze, but there's something about the steadfast Good vs. Evil innocence of a Santo film that should not be tainted by such things.

In this one, we learn that in addition to all his other accomplishments (pro wrestler extraordinaire, amateur crime fighter and sleuth, the idol of millions), Santo is also a scientist and inventor (The guy is like the South of the Border equivalent of Buckaroo Banzai).  He's invented a time machine, of all things, and of course this invention is the catalyst for the entire adventure that follows.  Santo also has several non-wrestling friends assisting him this time around, including a likeable buffoon who serves as comic relief, and a foil for Santo's one-liners(!)and physical abuse.  At times, this played almost like a toned down 3 Stooges film!

The lone wrestling match included about midway through is actually worked into the plot of the movie (in a very contrived way).  Usually the matches seen in a Santo flick, while entertaining, seem almost out of place and simply serve as filler.

The story is ridiculous, the acting is laughable, and the action is sparse.  But it all somehow comes together in a gloriously goofy package that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone who enjoys these wonderfully campy movies from years past.

This black and white Rise Above full frame print is passable, with a fair bit of hiss and background noise.  But if you're like me, and need to have the subtitles on to follow the plot (such as it is), then you can leave the sound turned down low.  One thing I've found about these Rise Above DVD's, and that is that the subtitles are VERY easy to read.  And this comes from someone whose eyesight is not the best, and sometimes has trouble with subtitled films.

In all, I highly recommend this fun, FUN movie.  Buy it, if you at all like these old masked Mexican wrestler movies.  You won't be sorry!",1270166400,7,2669,4.619957537154989

7989655,2,B000095J5P,"I've heard a lot about these films - about how they're so bad that they're good. Well, the truth is that this one isn't that bad, which unfortunately means it's not that good either. Santo invents a time travel machine and sends his girfriend back to what passes as a fairly flat adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. She discovers the whereabouts of Dracula's treasure, comes back to the present and takes Santo and his sidekicks to the cave where said treasure is buried. Little do they know that a mysterious hooded figure and his handfull of bad guys are also after the treasure - a couple of lame fights ensue (including a wrestling match with the hooded figure's son), and then Santo finally comes up against the Count himself for one of the great anti-climaxes of horror/camp cinema. Apparently two versions of these Mexican wrestling horror films were made - a tame version for the Mexican kiddie market and a sleazier one (ie contains violence and nudity) for the foreign market. This is the tame version, which may explain why it's so bland. I hate to say this, but it needed the sleaze to liven things up. The print is only average (but at least the bad sound and grainy footage reminds you of watching those B-Grade horror flicks on late night TV in your youth). The montage of Santo movies looks like fun, and could even convince you to rush out and by the boxed set - fortunately the main event would dissuade you from wasting your money. Disappointing - I was looking forward to some ""loopy but fun"" cinema.",1062892800,5,1521,4.6162361623616235
