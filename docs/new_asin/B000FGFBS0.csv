2564434,2,B000FGFBS0,"My young children love a video called Jingle Bell Baby so much, and I thought this one would be similar.  Although this definitely had cute Christmas music.  All it showed, and I mean ALL, was baby's faces.  There wasn't even anything Christmasy in the background.  Pretty much just babies watching bubbles float down.  My 24 month old got bored right away.  Disappointing.",1284508800,,373,4.935483870967742

2564444,5,B000FGFBS0,"I only wanted to order a ""Bride for Christmas"" but had to purchase the duo. I don't care about the other movie.  I love this movie and have seen it many times.  Andrew Walker & Arielle Kebbel have great screen charisma.  It's a cute love story about a couple who have fear and trouble with commitment to a long term relationship: marriage.  This is a light-hearted romance that is moral and fun.",1455926400,,395,4.444444444444445

2564451,3,B000FGFBS0,"Babys First Christmas is another of those highly manufactured scenarios where a shrill liberal lawyer (Rachel Wilson as Jenna) is depicted as the good guy while her conservative lawyer enemy (Casper Van Dien as Kyle) is depicted as the devil incarnate because he doesnt agree with her view point on just about everything.  Naturally, the story supports her views, not his.  Its a tired plot device promoted by liberals and supported by filmmakers willing to march in lockstep with their point of view.  I didn't think Hallmark would trod that well-worn path but apparently, they do.  As for the romance aspect of this story, were expected to believe that after a decade of taking potshots at each other that they abruptly fall in love............when hes willing to tow the line her way!  At times this heavy handed approach gets a little weary.  But it was nice seeing Art Hindle in the small role of a dastardly dad who changes his ways.

A Bride for Christmas features another tired plot that has been used to death.  During poker night a challenge is put forth, find a random woman and entice her into marriage before Christmas.  The target is picked by the jerk who offered the challenge.  The victim of this cruel joke is Jessie (Arielle Kebbel) who has previously dumped three men at the altar.  With the gauntlet thrown down, Aiden (Andrew W. Walker) sets about trapping the wedding-shy patsy.  He oozes as much charm as he can muster, relying heavily on his good looks, winning smile, and the ability to be phony and sincere at the same time.  Naturally, she cant resist his animal magnetism as he stalks her into submission.  Will she find out shes being made a fool of before Christmas?

Both movies count on the willingness of viewers to overlook blatant reprehensible behavior that eventually leads to a romance (thats based entirely on subterfuge and coercion).  Its an odd definition for love.  Guys can treat you like crap but if they almost say they're sorry, that absolves them of any wrongdoing.

Happy holidays!",1450742400,2,2031,4.820809248554913

2564462,4,B000FGFBS0,"I would rather have had ""A Bride for Christmas"" as a single movie as I liked it very much.

2564465,5,B000FGFBS0,"Bought this 2pk for A Bride For Christmas because I'm a Kimberley Sustad fan. Loved her straight-forward character (""Assertive!"" and ""Switch it up"" for her sister to ask the guy to marry her). Very cute movie and I really like Krebbel and Walker together (they're adorable together in Bridal Wave too). Hallmark needs to use Sustad in more movies...and as lead! She's super likeable and so unique!! Give the girl a movie series please! I'd like to see her in something with Warren Christie.
The dvd plays ok in the bluray player.  I've noticed though that the Hallmark multi movie packs play a little less clear than the single movie releases, which leads me to say I wish these movies were also released separately.
I'm a sap for Christmas movies so I watched the Baby's First Christmas for the first time (just didn't interest me to watch this one when televised)....and got to say...I liked it. Not loved it, but liked it.",1430006400,6,925,4.709876543209877

8122047,5,B000FGFBS0,"This story was the first one I had seen with Arielle Kebbel and Andrew W. Walker.  They have really great loving chemistry.  I believe there is another movie with the two of them in it but I prefer this particular story.  I have seen Andrew Walker in several other Hallmark productions.  He is handsome in the ""boy next door"" type and I always find him appealing in each of his other leading man roles.  Working with his other leading actresses is fine but he charms the best by far in this particular Hallmark production.

The pretense of this story is rather ridiculous even for Hallmark.  Arielle's character has been engaged several times and even goes as far as the wedding itself but chickens out at the very last minute.  Andrew's character makes a bet with his buddies that he can marry a girl before or on Christmas.  And so it goes off into the Hallmark formula. . . .

Highly recommend.",1501632000,,897,4.515527950310559
