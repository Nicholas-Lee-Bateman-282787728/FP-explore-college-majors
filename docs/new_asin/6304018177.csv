7859720,5,6304018177,"I found this Biography of Nixon well balanced and accurate. It covers his early years in Whittier, Ca and leads up to his Naval Service in WWII. Then the biography goes into detail to his rise in political power and, unfortunately, his eventual political demise. However, the redeeming factor discusses Nixon's ""return as elder Statesman"" from 1974's resignation to his death. It is truly worth while to view -and I admit, Nixon was the first President I voted for at age 21. He and I wrote letters to each other and he knew me not. Yet his courteous nature provided me with personal letters from this man I admired. His opening of China to the West was a week that ""Changed the World"" I was a college sophomore and his every day in China thrilled me. Nixon was a man of both brilliance and pettiness. His human weaknesses are weaknesses we all share in common. Yet his brilliance was his own. I read many of his books, and found them to be well written and authentic. He did not have a ""ghost"" writer for his many volumes. He alone was the author, insightful and best sellers.",1388361600,5,1077,4.5

7859722,4,6304018177,"I disagree with the last reviewer.  I thought this documentary went way too easy on Nixon.  They seemed to downplay the scandal and, in the end, call him ""beloved"".  I don't think so.",1228780800,,183,4.484848484848484
7859723,5,6304018177,"But if it's got Tricky Dick Nixon in it, you KNOW it has to be good...",1205280000,,70,3.4375
7859724,3,6304018177,Great biography but if studying the life of Nixon one will need more research material. The video is not really fairly balanced and is a bit more negative then it has to be. Too much is placed on Watergate and not enough on the positives of his work.,973036800,16,250,4.229166666666667
