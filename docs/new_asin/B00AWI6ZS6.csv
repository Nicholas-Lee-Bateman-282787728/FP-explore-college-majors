5523333,4,B00AWI6ZS6,"... and a whole face lift for Mills Creek Entertainment, whom, before this, was doing sub par (read poor VHS quality) blurays! These two movies look both decent and they are both enjoyable. I actually liked Lilith more, i thought that it was a stronger film.
The most important part, though, is the fact that now i would reconsider my attitude towards Mills Creek products - it is possible that i might try their products again. What i had before (the 2 spaghetti western for instance) was, at best, dollar-store quality.",1369180800,,521,4.736263736263736
5523334,5,B00AWI6ZS6,"This is a great two-fer blu-ray of two obscure 60's classics, courtesy of Mill Creek.

""Ship of Fools"" stars Vivien Leigh, Lee Marvin, Jose Ferrer, Simone Signoret, George Segal, Elizabeth Asley, Charles Korvin, Michael Dunn and Heinz Ruehmann, and was directed by the great Stanley Kramer.

""Lilith"" stars Warren Beatty, Jean Seberg, Peter Fonda, Kim Hunter, Anne Meacham, James Patterson, Robert Reilly and Gene Hackman in one of his first roles.

The PQ and AQ on these are excellent.
Recommended for fans of classic cinema!",1368403200,4,527,5.176470588235294

I was first skeptical about Mill Creek due to some DVDs they released which weren't good, but this Blu-ray double feature changed my mind. The video and audio quality of the movies are excellent with some special features. Both of these movies are great and presented in Widescreen and B&W.

5523337,4,B00AWI6ZS6,"This is a terrific movie with an old-fashioned, European cinema flare. The acting is superb. The situations . . .  uncomfortable, to say the least. Lots of moral and ethical issues are creating the tension here. You'll want to reach through the set and smack a few people, including two little monster kids running rampant on deck.

The reason I say it's not for everyone is that: (1) There is no plot. (2) There are no real heroes, only observers. (3) It's sad and pathetic at times. (4) Characters don't arc. (5) No one gets what they deserve. And (6) There's virtually no action. In fact, the movie doesn't really build to a climax. There's a seminal moment, but it's not like we're speeding down a hill on a runaway train to get there.

Lastly, regarding the portrayals of the film's fascists (the setting is the rise of Naziism), the venom spewed by Jose Ferrer's character, and the closet racism displayed by other characters in the movie, never gets directed at the gypsy dance troupe on the ship, which seems, historically, out of context. I'm not sure whether this was deliberate or not, but it seems the film actually goes out of its way to stereotype the gypsies. Maybe we're suppose to be revolted by the actions of the soon to be Nazis, and at the same time, we're suppose to be looking inwards at the way we feel about the film's portrayal of gypsies, because nothing they're shown doing in the movie warrants anybody's admiration. I don't know. It's strange. A movie that makes a point about racism goes out of its way stereotype a particular group, portraying them all as hooligans, whores, thieves and scoundrels.",1367539200,2,1630,4.672473867595818
5523338,5,B00AWI6ZS6,"Ship Of Fools is one of the hallmarks of motion picture making as any cinephile will tell you.  The cast is absolutely incredible and it features the swan song of Vivian Leigh who will make you believe she knew it at the time of her performance.  Some find Stanley Kramer's style of film making a bit heavy handed but in the case of this adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's hugely successful novel his style served him well in every regard.  From the black and white play of light and shadow of the cinematography (the best since Casablanca) to the exquisitely nuanced and finely tuned performances of the actors brought together in 'Grand Hotel' Hollywood tradition you get a slice of time offering a prelude of horrors to come with the rise of Nazism and its effect on social stratum encompassed within the confines of this ship of fools.  Shakespearian scale human folly acted out by a dream cast that surpassed the novel in laying bare their foibles before an audience that ate it up in 1965...as well they should have with the likes of Oskar Werner and the great french superstar Simone Signoret in the movies most telling love story lifting the art of acting to new heights (especially Werner)...Jose Ferrer's high handed and often superbly masked gleeful urgency as an anti-semitic ghoul...the wonderful German actor Heinz Ruehmann as the perpetually upbeat Jew effectively providing the thistle beneath Ferrer's facade...a totally surprising turn by Flamenco Dancing great Jose Greco...not to mention Lee Marvin as a has been baseball player delivering a dramatic performance to equal his peers (who would have believed?)...and to me the cleverest turn of all by George Segal and Elizabeth Ashely as cardboard cutout innocents expected in every production of the period and social level the movie is set in and they had the wherewithall to play it straight making them seem out of place and in another movie altogether as they would have seemed at the time... and last but certainly not least in my mentionings...the astonishing Michael Dunn in his Oscar winning turn as the greek chorus to all that happens onboard.  The movie is a master acting class on all levels...including the steward level passengers who endure as do the masses through it all (with an incredible bit of acting by Oskar Werner as he witnesses their washing down by the crew) that speaks the message of the movie in bold strokes.  But above and beyond it all Vivian Leigh commands your attention in a performance that is a culmination of all the triumphs and tribulations her career had provided her along with all the grief and humiliation with which her private life had lashed her...funneled into a performance for the ages...the grandest diva of them all dissimulating before your eyes even as her deterioration becomes self evident...and her resolve teetering on the brink of madness.  Let's just say that Scarlett wars with Blanche and the explosive battlefield can be seen from shore.  In the case of this movie Miss Leigh EARNED top billing...and how many actors can truly say that in a cast as talented as this?  In case you haven't guessed by now I highly recommend this movie.

On to Lilith (it's as if whoever chose to pair these two features selected as his theme 'Actresses who's private lives were as tragic as their careers were successful).  An early Warren Beatty drama with Peter Fonda (showing his acting chops early on) and Jean Seberg who is the poster child for tragic actresses...dying of an overdose at age Forty after 37 movies.  Hounded by the FBI into a premature delivery (the FBI spreading unfounded rumors that the father was black in retaliation for her financial support of certain civil rights groups) and death of the child two days later.  This moment seemed to have unhinged a part of her and despite her immense talent and beauty she descended into a kind of living hell toward the end of her life being institutionalized several times and marrying men in rapid tandem until she was found lifeless in the backseat of her car clutching pills and a suicide note written in French and in her own handwriting outside her Paris apartment in 1979.  Why you ask did I let you in on all that?  Because this movie is about a young girl who is a fragile beauty institutionalized and befriended by Beatty who falls in love with his patient and is engaged in a tug-of-war with another patient for her hand (Peter Fonda).  It is a love story played out on many levels in an outstanding script.  The centerpiece here being the performance by Seberg in a role that she knew far too intimately in what turned out to be a case of art imitating life.  The film is hauntingly effective and the leads will turn your head and your heart.  Not near the level of Ship Of Fools...but still...in its own right...a classic...and certainly a tragedy for the ages.",1366934400,16,4857,4.795209580838323

5523340,5,B00AWI6ZS6,"Mill Creek Entertainment offers two wonderful films in lovely sharp finely grained transfers that both look fantastic in the blu ray format.  What a great deal, too!  I just hope that they continue to produce twofers of this caliber.  They have a deal with Sony, whose classic film library is sorely under-represented in the BD form.  I'd sure love some widescreen technicolor doubles like TARAS BULBA and KINGS OF THE SUN, SOLOMON AND SHEBA and ALEXANDER THE GREAT, or maybe for Easter, BARABBAS and SALOME.  But, beyond wishful thinking, whatever they do in the future will undoubtedly be superior in quality if this is any indication.

Lilith was OK, an early performance from a young Warren Beatty and Jean Seberg. Not very interesting or exciting; Robert Rossen directed, but missed something essential to make it as riveting as it might be. Beatty tries, but is miscast. Seberg is an intriguing actress, but her career didn't flourish to her satisfaction and she eventually committed suicide. Pity.

5523353,3,B00AWI6ZS6,An interesting b&w double feature. Both are situational character studies. One is set aboard a German cruise ship before WWII. The other is in a New England mental institution in the mid 20th century. Both are thought provoking.,1389225600,,228,5.026315789473684
5523354,4,B00AWI6ZS6,"I would give both of these films 3 1/2 stars for content but push up the overall rating of the package to 4 stars.  Both films have a 1080p transfer with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and come with a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track.  While neither transfer can be considered pristine, they are certainly better than the DVD and caused me no irritation.  The audio was excellent.  There are no extras.  The packaged films are quite a bargain and worthy of purchase.

LILITH:
Lilith Arthur (Jean Seberg) is a mental patient at a New England mental institution - called an asylum in this 1964 film - along with numerous other schizophrenics. Vincent Bruce (Warren Beatty), a recently discharged soldier returns to his home town in search for employment. He applies at the hospital, interviewing with Dr. Brice (Kim Hunter), and although he has no training, she decides to hire him as an aide. We learn later that Vincent's mother spent time there as a patient.

Vincent begins to take more than casual interest in Lilith as does another patient, Stephen played by Peter Fonda. Lilith is aloof, especially with Stephen, but begins to soften with Vincent. While Vincent keeps things on the up-and-up he eventually takes things too far and falls hard. There isn't a lot going on with this film under Robert Rossen's direction. He plays very slow and focuses on the relationships within the hospital.

There is a secondary plot featuring Vincent and the girl he left behind, Laura (Jessica Walter). Unsure of Vincent's pre-war romantic aspirations, she has married a local misogynistic meathead played by Gene Hackman. The film is full of mysterious pasts of all the key players. It all leads to an eye-opening if logical conclusion.

SHIP OF FOOLS:
This black and white beauty earned 8 Oscar nominations including best picture. It justifiably won for art direction and cinematography which shows up well in the Blu ray transfer.

A German cruise ship is sailing from Mexico to Germany with a pit stop in Spain to offload a contingent of poor workers being deported. Evidently their cheap labor working in the sugar cane fields is keeping the natives from work. Also returning is a Spanish political dissident, La Condesa (Simone Signoret). Those familiar with ""Grand Hotel"" and other ensemble films will recognize the style.

Numerous couplings interact on the ship which creates big melodrama and interesting subplots and subtext. For example the poor Spanish are essentially relegated to the lower deck where they sleep and eat for the 26 day journey. The setting is 1933 and the swell of Nazism is on the rise. This is depicted with particular vitriol by a character known as Rieber (Jose Ferrer). An unmarried playboy, his bunkmate turns out to be a proud Jew (Heinz Ruhmann).

La Condesa, it turns out is also a bit of a junky. She uses her charms on the ship's Dr. Schumann (excellent Oskar Werner) to get a bit of Morphine, to help her sleep. This relationship between the two evolves in to something more, in spite of the fact they are married to others. It would seem they just haven't gotten around to divorce. George Segal and Elizabeth Ashley (currently seen in HBO's ""Treme"") portray young lovers on the precipice of marriage, but have significant disagreement as to each other's roles. Lee Marvin plays a has-been baseball player and Vivien Leigh makes her final film appearance as a divorced, aging blue-blood.

Finally, Michael Dunn is the dwarf Glocken, who kind of narrates the film especially at the beginning and end. Director Stanley Kramer stirs the pot of politics and class warfare in this adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's novel. Screenwriter Abby Mann received an Oscar nomination along with actors Dunn, Signoret and Werner. The film's downfall would seem to be its length (149 minutes). I think the story could have been told equally well shaving about 30 minutes off. Still if you like good dialog delivered by skilled actors, take a look.",1387324800,6,3956,4.904191616766467
5523355,5,B00AWI6ZS6,The price for this double-bill of Columbia films from the mid-1960's is very low. No extras but very nice prints that look great. I recall seeing LILITH in a theatre when it was first released and remembered liking it. Seeing it again I can say that I like it very much. The directing and cinematography are very fine as is the acting of all with especially strong performances from Jean Seberg. Stanley Kramer's SHIP OF FOOLS is very well acted and has a fine script by Abby Mann.

5523362,5,B00AWI6ZS6,"Received this film along with 'Cleopatra' (at a much higher price).  With Cleopatra, it was hard to stay awake while Ship of Fools was absolutely riveting. It's like a book you can't put down. Not a lot of plot but that's the point - a lot of people with their own special problems heading toward the new Nazi Germany with anti-semitism already clouding the horizon.  The cast is high powered and excellent - Vivien Leigh, Lee Marvin, Michael Dunn (nominated), Oskar Werner (nominated), Simone Signoret (nominated), George Segal, Elizabeth Ashley, Jose Ferrer, Jose Greco, and Barbara Luna were all excellent.  Have always loved this film and was happy to get it in a good quality blu-ray.  Rank it among my ten best.  Another film along similar lines with an equally high powered ensemble is 'Voyage of the Damned' which I also highly recommend.

This 1965 film was nominated for best picture.  At this late date, it's hard to imagine that a film like ""The Sound of Music"" won over such masterpieces as this and ""Doctor Zhivago"" but those awards were never a big indicator of real quality anyway.

From Wiki:

Ship of Fools is a 1962 novel by Katherine Anne Porter which tells the tale of a group of disparate characters sailing from Mexico to Europe aboard a German freighter and passenger ship. It is an allegory that traces the rise of Nazism and looks metaphorically at the progress of the world on its ""voyage to eternity"".

The theme of the novel is the passengers' unavailing withdrawal from a life of disappointment, seeking a kind of utopia, and, ""without knowing what to do next"", setting out for a long voyage to pre-World-War-II Europe, a world of prejudice, racism and evil. Mrs. Treadwell, a nostalgic American divorcee, hopes to find happiness in Paris, where she once spent her youth. Elsa Lutz, the plain daughter of a Swiss hotelkeeper, thinks heaven might be in the Isle of Wight. Jenny, an artist, says the most dangerous and happiest moment in her life was when she was swimming alone in the Gulf of Mexico, confronted with a school of dolphins. And at the end of the novel, one of the ship's musicians, a gangly starving boy, feels overjoyed to finally be off the ship and back in his home country, as if Germany were a ""human being, a good and dear trusted friend who had come a long way to welcome him"". Thus Porter manages to convey that salvation is an illusion, and evil is inevitable.",1370736000,,2413,4.696682464454977
