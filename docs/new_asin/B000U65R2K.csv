8342273,1,B000U65R2K,"This dvd lasted only 25 minutes, horrible. There are many dvds which have many many minutes of run time costing the same 24 dollars. I consider it to be the worst dvd I have ever purchased. It does have valuable information but it lacks safety measures, putting together a spearline etc.... Very empty dvd. Definitely not worth the 24 dollars. Period.",1300147200,2,351,4.770491803278689
8342274,5,B000U65R2K,"An extremely informative video, do not let the front cover fool you.  It might look like a video from the 60's looking at the cover but the content and filming is very well made.  The clarity of the water is awesome all filmed in south Florida.  You will not regret this purchase if you like the water and specialy for beginners. Just wish it would have been a longer video and that they also added the dangers of the sport such as Shallow water black out and Samba (LMC).  Enjoy",1282435200,4,479,4.288888888888889
