In the subtitles this comes out as RICHEL, a minor glitch but one that continiuosly threw us off as we tried to figure out who this was. My husband speak some French and he felt that many of the translations were done by someone not really a fluent English speaker; they were of  stilted usage. Visually the film is excellent.",1418342400,,485,4.388888888888889
7877248,5,6304744242,"While less famous than his collaborations with Harold Pinter, ""Mr. Klein"" may well be director Joseph Losey's best work. A chilling parable that tends to leave viewers speechless, it offers a brilliantly sustained vision of life in a decadent, futureless society. Perhaps most importantly, this is a film about the Holocaust that does *not* focus on its horrors. Instead, these are taken as a given that surround the central story, smothering all concerned in a blanket of complicity.
The most remarkably insidious aspect of ""Mr. Klein"" is the clever way we are put in a position of sympathy with a basically unlikeable, corrupt character, as he struggles to prove he is not Jewish. Because we know what the consequences of failure in the effort will be, viewers too are implicated in the situation, forced to confront how *we* would behave in similar circumstances. Instead of the easy moralizing encouraged in most treatments of this subject, the film presents a thoroughly political, unblinkered examination of guilt and denial.
Like most of Losey's work, the film is slow-moving, distinctively designed and more than a tad opaque. In his less ambitious efforts, that opacity can often irritate. Here, with a real subject worthy of his talents, the director's famously menacing atmosphere seems absolutely right, the only way to tell this story. Losey's penchant for implying something nasty under the surface makes sense when we know that at any moment a jack-booted member of the SS may appear from off-camera. It is this threat, this constantly over-hanging possibility, that generates the fear which is the real subject of the film.
All concerned are working in top form. Delon manages the awkward task of making us care what happens to Klein, even as we are repulsed by his actions and attitudes. Gerry Fisher's cinematography is the opposite of beautiful: cold, clammy, it superbly conveys a sense of dank decay. And special mention should be made of Egisto Macchi's spare, dissonant music. If only Hollywood understood such understatement!
The transfer for this tape is adequate, but I profoundly wish this superb film were available on DVD.",1052611200,21,2151,5.148571428571429
