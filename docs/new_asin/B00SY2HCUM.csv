I did not buy this movie from an Amazon seller but regardless this film is worthy of love and affection.

Let's face it. When people think about having to read through a subtitled movie, it ruins it for so many. For me, I don't have an issue. I find that I don't have to turn up the volume, try to anticipate scenes, or be wrapped in the music. I can just read. I have so many subtitled movies it is also second nature to me to shift my eyes downward.

0.5mm is a 2014 Japanese film written and directed by Momoko Ando and also starring her sister Sakura Ando. The title reference comes toward the end of the movie. Sawa (Ando) appears to be a devoted and dedicated in-house caregiver for the geriatric elderly bedridden at home. The dutiful caregiver tirelessly and unobtrusively attends to family members that the spouse can't, won't, or, are emotionally detached from. This not so subtle burden requires Sawa to take on more and more responsibilities. It may seem that Sawa is getting shafted by this humiliation, but, she is sly. She doesn't have responsibilities like a typical person would nor the trepidation that a typical person would in insinuating herself so that she may find room and board for a very long time. She targets elderly men doing compromising things as leverage to resolve the immediate problem of finding a place to stay. She's evil, right? I mean who in their right mind would put up with such a con? But she redeems herself, begrudgingly in the opinions of the hapless men, by cooking great meals, cleaning up after them, and most of all, making the men feel appreciated, useful, and not a burden on society. As she learns to become selfless and thoughtful, she learns inner truths about herself and becomes a caring and responsible human being.

The vast majority of films which ever get released, viewed, or are profitable are filled with hip, young, beautiful, or filled with older, beautiful actors, or, young and buff, or grizzled and salt/peppered bravado, but very few films will have older, mature, gray-haired elderly being showcased. Honestly, these don't make as much money as the Diane Keatons, Diane Lanes, Tom Cruises, Denzel Washingtons, and Bradley Coopers films. This is a shame because this film is so engaging and topical today as any of the action flicks, weepy dramas that may garner most of the attention. How many of us shut out what grandparents go through every day, how many of us don't want to deal with the rising cost of healthcare, how many of us don't want to think about the fact that elderly people have libidos (okay you got me there). But this largely forgotten and shuttered segment of the population can create truly engrossing and meaningful message oriented films which pale in comparison to the groin-centric flicks that sits at the top of the heap.

Don't let the fact that a three hour film seems daunting. Schindler's List is a three hour long film and that was so honest a movie that no one minded the length. Magnolia is a three hour movie and I didn't mind the duration. It's all about timing and story. Lastly, if you look at Sakura Ando everyone can see that she isn't beautiful, she  is an ordinary woman looking for the next mark - the next hustle. She is tired, smelly, and she does a thankless job . At no time in the movie does she ever look radiant or refreshed; wearing the same coat, the same tennis shoes, the same dress. But she radiates inside and her small kindnesses don't go unnoticed - much like in life.

Give this movie, and movies like it a chance. You won't regret it.",1519948800,,3634,4.626356589147287
