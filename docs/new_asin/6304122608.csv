7861992,5,6304122608,"In preparation for my 4 year old daughters presence at my labor and delivery and her new role as a big sister I got this video. VERY WISE CHOICE I have to say. Not only did she love this video, it helped her to understand more than I could explain and it got her excited! I am a parent who does not hide the graphic nature of life to my daughter, but this video was not very graphic. It shows the uterus and vagina with diagrams and cartoons and it shouldnt be offensive or innappropriate to parents with a more sheltering approach. This is an A+ video if you are trying to explain birth and becoming a sibling to your younger child. I also purchased a book for her ""Being Born"" -very graphic, VERY educational, also worth every penny.",1300838400,,735,4.294964028776978
