7932283,2,B000056NNS,"I just finished watching this film, and I really should take a deep breath and wait a while before I submit a review, so as to be more objective - but I can't. So here goes:

In the Zorro cinematic canon, The Three Swords of Zorro ranks at the very bottom. And ""bottom"" may be too lofty a position for this stinker. If one were to come up with a place or ranking lower than ""bottom,"" that would still be too high an elevation for this utter dung. A film offering from Spain, it had the original working title of  Las Tres Espadas del Zorro. In this dvd reincarnation, the frames are terribly  spliced; in the opening credits alone, the actors' surnames aren't fully on screen (Martin Scorcese would have had a conniption!). The transfer is ridiculously bad - it looks as if someone had copied it directly from a crumbling VHS tape that's been ravaged by a murderous raccoon. The tinned sound is awful; I had to turn the volume way up just to achieve some sense of vocal clarity. The musical score is about as rousing as Nyquil. It is also dubbed, which wouldn't be so bad, but combined with the other transgressions, it borders on insufferability. If this were a TV movie, I'd be less harsh, but I say that theatrical releases need to be better.

The plot goes like this:  It is 1830, the year of Mexico's independence. But several local governors disregard the governing central authority and strike out on their own, causing a reign of havoc and misery for the besieged people of Baja California. One man who calls himself Zorro stands up and draws the enmity of Governor Manuel de Paredes, who decides to hunt down the rebellious upstart. The movie opens with the pillaging and burning of a poor village. A dying mother gives up her baby boy to the safekeeping of one of the fleeing peasants, who promptly abandons the child in a church. But the baby is adopted by a woman named Clara, who names the baby Diego. A decade passes and Zorro is at last captured by the law and is incarcerated. Jump to some years later: young Diego is now a meek chap in public, but secretly is imbued with honor, a good heart, a flair for justice, and all that good stuff. The oppressors are still oppressing the oppressed, and something must be done. So, of course, Diego - sans mustache - dons the mask of Zorro and wields his sword and whip. Somewhere along the way, he liberates his people from tyranny, frees his languishing father (the original Zorro - trust me, you see it coming) from prison, and ends up with la bonita mujer.

The worst sin this movie commits is in the execution of its storyline - it just plain sucks! The premise sounds good; the end result is frustratingly abysmal. The actors are uniformly not good. I understand that the lead Guy Stockwell (new Zorro) is Dean's brother. Dean should've disowned him after this lousy performance. Or, at least, slapped him around some. Oh, Stockwell does try and is partially successful. But his Zorro just doesn't have enough flair and zest. He wilts in comparison to Tyrone Power, Antonio Banderas, and even Douglas Fairbanks. Even George Hamilton's gay Zorro has more panache. Mikaela Wood as Diego's sister Maria and Gloria Milland as love interest Virginia are ravishing, but their looks aren't enough to salvage the film. But Mikaela, at least, has a sexy, playful personality.

The special features contain a trivia quiz, a voice-over critic's review (the critic gives it 3 stars - I'm assuming, out of 30 stars); and a few actor biographies.

The Three Swords of Zorro is not diverting, is not interesting and should not be purchased. This horrendous movie, combined with its poor technical aspects (sound quality, dubbing, horrible transfer...), wasted an hour and a half of my life, which I could've better spent either forcibly slamming Q-tips into my ears or listening to the Best of Right Said Fred. I'm pretty sure this rotter of a flick set swashbuckling back for years and made the term ""derring-do"" a reprehensible word to folks who've seen this film.

Instead, for the definitive Zorro film, check out the marvelous The Mark of Zorro (1940). The Mask of Zorro (1998) is almost as good. Even a movie titled The Buttcrack of Zorro probably would've been an improvement. I give it two stars. One star for the film's few redeeming qualities: Zorro's first appearance (wherein, Stockwell does show signs of life) and the culminating sequence with the 3 Zorros. The other star is because Guy Stockwell is in my house with a gun to my head. But I'm sure he just wants spare change.",1153008000,3,4538,4.655430711610487
