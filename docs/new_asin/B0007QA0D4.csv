2230947,3,B0007QA0D4,"The one thing I liked about this dvd is that it provides a really good total body workout using some basic stripper moves with a hip hop flare.  What I didn't like is that it doesn't really distinguish itself from other basic aerobic dvds.  After 15 minutes of hip rolling and pelvic bumping, things can get a little boring.  Where's the sexy floorwork?  Lapwork? Polework?

Also, I found it boring that all of the ladies in the dvd are about the same age, race and body shape.  More diversity with body size would have made this tape more interesting!  Also, this tape does not use any props.  The only thing that links it to striptease are the bumps and grinds!

For people who want to learn striptease or erotic dance, there's going to be some disappointment with this one.  Of course, you can always take the moves presented here and come up with your own choreography.

Overall, I liked this dvd for its workout capacity, but I wish the producers had put more thought into how to make striptease aerobics more sexy and interesting!",1111190400,48,1036,4.576086956521739
2230948,5,B0007QA0D4,"I found out about this new workout under the recommendation section and ordered it...  All I can say is WOW!  This is absolutely amazing workout!  Quick paced for the cardio, muscle toning with the isolations and uses moves you could put to use on the dance floor as well!  Too bad there are no classes around here like this!  I would be there in a heart beat!",1110758400,18,360,4.313432835820896
2230949,5,B0007QA0D4,"I'm the type of person who is easily bored with the daily exercise routine, especially workouts on DVD.  When my best friend let me borrow her copy of Urban Striptease, I was hooked! This DVD provides a great workout, but more importantly to me, it's a ton of fun.",1110240000,15,264,4.387755102040816
2230950,5,B0007QA0D4,"I've taken Tricia's class and she teaches a mix of moves that are sexy, but not overtly racy or shocking. It's a fun routine and from my experience, I've witnessed women of all ages feel empowered by her class. It's also a really great workout that incorporates moves, much like an aerobics or dance class. You will work muscles you never knew existed!",1110153600,15,352,4.603174603174603
2230951,5,B0007QA0D4,"it's awesome.  Took 6 weeks of her classes in Seattle, and she kicked my butt.  AND it was FUN!  Sure to be a smash with you too!",1109721600,12,129,3.7037037037037037
2230952,5,B0007QA0D4,"I tried this DVD after taking a few Urban Striptease classes at my gym and its awesome!  Its just as good as taking a real class, only I can do it at home whenever I have time.  Tricia is a really great instructor, very motivating and not annoying like a lot of the celebs & other DVD ""fitnes gurus"".  I HIGHLY recommend!",1107820800,15,321,4.145161290322581
2230953,3,B0007QA0D4,"The menu options give you either a full workout, a mini tease of only 18 min or any chapter. The background beat is definitely cheap & almost nails on the chalkboard with no temptation to dance. The stage is a nice simple brick wall with vinyl black floor. There are 6 backup girls with Tricia all in pick sports bras & black pants, 2 of them in their 40s or more, all in great shape.
Tricia herself is upbeat, sweet & means well, I love her honest personality & friendliness, but she's not the best person to learn to be more graceful, fluid or be in touch with your body. Her backup dancers are mostly worse. It seems they are more focused on doing the moves to burn calories then to be sexy.
Tricia also is always counting loudly with too much enthusiasm, like counting is more important then dancing, as if she needs it in order to move. She breaks down the routine to each step, going in 1/2 speed or slower which is great, but sometimes goes over the simple moves several times too many. There is a separate part for the harder moves like undulations, but that was taught faster then other moves & she doesn't give enough analogies or body placement. I'm glad I already own belly dance dvds.
After every time you do more then 2-3 moves at once, she always lets you stop & ""shake it off"" for 15 seconds, even if the moves are very simple like walking in a circle. This doesn't help keep you going & reminds you you're working out & bored waiting.  Her teaching slowly should be the ""rest"" time like other DVDs, not more standing around, that's what a pause button is for. Since the music sucks, that's all you have in your head, her counting. Every time after the rest, she always has to count to 5 before starting again which is very annoying, a simple ""ready"" would suffice.
For extra strength training, there are about two moves in the middle of the routine, one a upward dog/downward dog cool move for the arms & the other being squats that she has you practice over & over a %&(#load of times that would kill anyone, that is presented like a regular aerobics class.
There are about 4 moves done on the floor & no pole work, but how many people have poles in their homes? I'm sure if you have one you can find other dvds for that specifically, this is for exercise & learning to dance, not become a professional.
There is a Mini Teaser which is 20 min which has a 10 min warm up & then you do the routine straight through normal speed 6x. That idea is great, just ruined by the bad dancing by the dancers.

The moves are the most stripper/sexy like of the ones I have which is what I was looking for, Carmen Electra's being too cute & MTV dance like & Jeff's Costa's being half hip-hop, half stripper style. Carmen's dance  instruction flowed better & no stopping, she counts a lot too, but not nearly as bad & she's more fluid in her movements & not afraid of her body & more in tune with it. I like Jeff's best, he's the most fluid, knows how to let go, least afraid of his body, he's also a lot of fun, his had best flow & was like a workout with teaching moves slowly & then speeding up with no rests.

I had a VERY hard time finishing this, not because it was hard to do, but because I was so uninspired by the bad music & self-conscious dancing & slow pace. Too bad since the moves were the most stripper style & sexy & Tricia was very patient about teaching moves slowly so people can follow. Dancing is about letting go & feeling your body, being aware & stripping most of all, but this dvd lets you down most in that area.
There still is almost no body awareness, they go through the motions, but seems like the moves could be more sexy with the right attitude that the women don't convey as much either due to production or shyness or no body awareness of their own. It's kinda done with little enthusiasm for dancing, more like ""eh, if this is what turns on my man, uugghhh, fine, I'll do it, but I won't like it, I don't feel attractive/sexy...."" This is what turned me off the most. Real dancers aren't afraid of their own body or enjoying how it moves, even martial artists are aware in an enthusiastic way, though different.

I found this one annoying, the counting gets on your nerves. I would not recommend this video.",1128038400,24,258,4.51063829787234
2230955,5,B0007QA0D4,"I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO ANYONE HOW GOOD THIS DVD MAKES ME FEEL EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY. EVERY TIME I FLIP IT IN I KNOW THAT I AM IN FOR A WORK OUT, ALONG WITH GRATITUDE THAT I CAN DANCE SEXY YET KEEP IT TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DECENCY. THE STEPS THAT TRICIA TAKES YOU THROUGH ARE CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW, IF YOU PUT YOUR FULL POTENTIAL OUT, YOU WILL GET A FANTASTIC WORK OUT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE, EVEN MEN I MEAN MY BOYFRIEND HAS EVEN DONE IT WITH ME ONCE OR TWICE, SO TAKE A CHANCE AND TRY SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING, AND GET A WELL ROUNDED FULL-BODY WORKOUT WHILE YOUR DOING SO.

THANKS FOR MAKING SUCH A UNIQUE WORK OUT VIDEO, I'VE GOT ANTS IN MY PANTS WAITING FOR DISC TWO!!!!

2230957,3,B0007QA0D4,"This DVD was not great.  Tricia has a great upbeat attitude, but moves fast through the routine, and you cannot hear the music well enough to keep a beat.  The background beat is awful to be more specific.  It sounds like low-budget keyboards. I have yet to try Carmen's, or Jeff's, but I would be suprised if they are not better than this.  Not a real cardio workout, but fun to try, just plan on reselling it!",1118880000,10,411,4.298701298701299

2230960,3,B0007QA0D4,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good strip aerobic DVD.  I like the fact that it is exercise, not a ""how to strip"" DVD and I love the interval training - that is a great idea.  BUT, there is one major fault with the program - it is structured too much like a dance routine and too little like a workout.  For me this means there were too many times during which my body cooled off before the DVD got back to working out my muscles.  I found myself just waiting around until the DVD got back to movement.  In fact, I had to invent my own moves to keep my heart rate up and my muscles working, which was frustrating.  I would love it if they corrected this one problem, because otherwise the moves are good and do work your muscles out.",1113868800,45,732,4.048611111111111

2230962,5,B0007QA0D4,"To put it bluntly, I think the lady from gainsville has it all wrong. If you want silly gimmicks like poles and boas and lap dancing, go buy a video on lap or pole-dancing or some other dvd on stripping. There are plenty of them on Amazon. I bought this video for a workout, and it was, especially in my legs and tush.

If you want to be a stripper, go to a strip club. If you want to get a workout and feel good then you should try this dvd out. I liked it. And if you think it gets boring after 15 minutes I don't know what to say except you must be a young stripper or have stopped watching. I thought the floorwork started in the 3rd part of the DVD, and if that part wasn't sexy enough, then there is no hope for me at all!! :)

Good Luck ladies...",1111190400,43,753,3.883116883116883

Certain workouts do hurt my knees and this one was really bad.. there are plenty i can do that don't add so much strain on my knees. if knees are not an issue for you, go for it, but be careful with certain moves where u have your knees going past your toes - its not healthy on your knees and there is a move in this video where you drop down low and open your knees while they are wayyyyy past your toes....",1291593600,,577,3.816666666666667

I really liked the instructor, though I do think that the DVD is a bit advanced for beginners. It can be hard to keep up with her until you learn the routine. Even if you can't do all of the exercises yet, though, it's a great DVD for working up to the instructor's level. It definitely get the heart pumping. I think it's a much better value than some of the other striptease workouts available on Amazon and through other sources. Of course, it is important to remember that this is a WORKOUT video, not a lesson on stripping.",1272931200,,627,4.190082644628099

8050409,5,B0007QA0D4,"I had the pleasure of taking a class from Tricia once, and this disc is almost as fun as being in the actual class.  As with any other at-home workout, you have to motivate yourself.  I definitely broke a sweat during this disc. It is very upbeat and kept me moving the whole time.  Of course, there are slower parts where the instructor goes over the chereography, just like in any dance class. If you don't like the slower parts, then just fast-forward.  Also, it is not intended to be a how-to for belly dancing or stripping - it's an AEROBIC workout with some striptease moves thrown in for fun.",1157500800,5,599,4.418181818181818
8050410,1,B0007QA0D4,"Except for two moves done in a pushup position, I don't think I learned anything new - I am not an exotic dancer, but I do it for fun for my boyfriend.  If you have any sensuality and creativity at all, you've already done these moves and don't need a dvd to tell you how.  If you can get to ""full routine 6 times"" by searching forward (it's not under ""tease segments"" for some reason), start there and you can pick up the moves while skipping the long, boring instruction.  The ""isolations"" section is a joke - bellydance moves are much sexier, more beautiful, and never cheesy.  Besides the awful music, it is distracting to have SEVEN dancers to watch, especially when only the front 3 really know what they are doing anyway; it would be an improvement to have fewer.  I would not recommend this dvd.  Any bellydance dvd (Neon is a great instructor) would be far more valuable and useful.",1157155200,6,891,4.469135802469136
8050411,3,B0007QA0D4,"Wow, this could have been so good.  I was thoroughly disappointed by Carmen Electras tape and thought this might be better.  It was in some ways.  No hokie pinup girls in really cheasy outfits, and it was actually a little challenging and got my heart rate up.  But it is probably going to be shelfware or given away soon.

I'll give them credit, this is much more down to earth and realistic, and the moves are not difficult.  And you can learn some very sexy moves from it, it just had a few major flaws in my view:

1) she makes numerous references to listening to the beat but does not follow it AT ALL.  I was so distracted by trying to go against my nature of actually dancing TO the beat and following her off-tempo moves, that I kept screwing up.

2) she stops too much.  I cahe whole n actually handle more than 4 seconds of moves, really, it's not that hard.  Everytime we had to stop for the next 4 seconds, I get bored waiting and my heartrate dropped.  I barely broke a sweat until we finally got to the end of the segment and did the whole thing from start to finish.  The intervals between segments were the most useful in terms of getting a workout.

3) OK, this is maybe me being old (I am 31 and not in terrible shape) but this is so hard on my knees.  I tried on and off carpet, with and without shoes, and midway I had to stop because my knees kept crunching and started to get sore.  It can be a workout, and be sexy and NOT be hazardous to my health, try belly dancing.  Way harder, way sexier, way better workout, similar moves.

4) Except for the one older woman and the punk-ish looking girl, it was a bunch of trixies dressed up in matching pink and black outfits.  Not as hokie, but almost, LOL.

In the end I came up with this:

I took a belly dancing class this summer.  It never hurt any body part, it made me sweat my rear end off, was made up of SUPER sexy moves (many of which were seen in this video) and made me feel great.  I think I'll stick with that.

And to the person complaining that there was no pole dancing, what???  Do you HAVE a pole in your house?  I don't, and most people learning to strip off an aerobics DVD don't either.",1154995200,10,2173,4.126491646778043
