1879539,2,B000094FG6,"I want to know where it states only western coasters, mainly Californian ones at that? why not call this DVD coasters of the US west?

What I really wanted to see was a proper state with coasters, and that's Ohio!!!! with Cedar Point with the best ones going, nothing comes close in California to that park.

My best DVD is ""America's Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills: The Ultimate Scream Machines"" has Flordia ones included too, beter by far view of them.",1112313600,4,455,4.675
1879540,5,B000094FG6,"This is the best rollercoaster DVD I've seen. Two hours of riding, history and technical details. The background material was very interesting. I enjoyed the commentary and riding along with regular folks who love coasters.

I just got back from my riding my favorite coasters at Islands of Adventure dozens of times each. Now I've got to get up the guts to try X. I've never been to Magic Mountain, but it's aboout time. Turns out they've got some cook coasters in Vegas too. Gotta go there. Too bad they only covered California and Vegas. There are some great rides East of the Rockies too. Here's hoping they do them too.",1111622400,3,624,4.621621621621622
1879541,4,B000094FG6,"The Extreme Rollercoasters DVD was great fun to watch.  What I enjoyed about it, above other movies of this sort, was that it got more in-depth about how they work, how they are created, and what average people as well as ""experts"" think about the various rollercoasters shown.  The visuals were great, and often times I almost felt the excitement instead of just watching it!  They focused on quite a few California rollercoasters, so I guess I've got to plan a trip out there soon because I'm missing all of the MOST extreme!  I would have liked to have seen more from MY part of the country, though.  :-)
I didn't care for the occasional summary of what you'd just viewed, almost like watching it on television and coming back from a commercial break -- it seemed to just take up time.  I assume they do that because on the DVD you can either watch the whole thing, or just pick which coasters you'd like to view one by one.
Overall, an excellent choice if you're a fan of rollercoasters!",1060732800,14,991,4.477777777777778

7989577,4,B000094FG6,"Acting as a grab bag of sorts, ""Extreme Rollercoasters"" highlights a multitude of different coaster types found in California as well as Las Vegas. Including interviews with designers, members of ACE (American Coaster Enthusiasts), fans and the like, the DVD is a great look at not only the amount of fun that can be had in west coast parks, but some technical and introspective information concerning how the coasters themselves function.

The amount of physical support that the ride ""X"" needs is unbelievable!

While I'm a midwesterner with a fondness for Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, I am still a coaster fan at heart. It's very fun to see rides from across the country and watch them be treated with the respect they deserve. The DVD does a good job of hyping rides and parks, but doesn't swoon so much that it becomes ""kiss a$$.""

I would have prefered the title to reflect the regional feel of the content, considering Cedar Point has been the ""rollercoaster capital"" for quite some time (and wasn't included in the video), but nevertheless, if you'd like to see some of the most innovative rides the country has to offer, pick up this DVD.",1201219200,,1149,4.763819095477387
7989578,5,B000094FG6,"This is a great DVD. It shows some of the best coasters around. You are able to see what it is like to ride these rides.  You also get to see the faces of the riders,(Who doesn't like the faces of terrified riders?) This DVD has a lot of info in it. So if you don't want a DVD like that don't get it.",1174608000,,300,3.6875
7989579,4,B000094FG6,This was a very good dvd but the narration was distracting at times. Still a good one to watch on a rainy day,1154044800,,109,3.782608695652174
7989580,1,B000094FG6,You will love these DVDs if you like to see the rider's mouth open and having a great time. Very little eyeing the experience of the actual ride looking foward. The film camera is always recording backwards at the riders with their months open.  I could see the same thing on the Discovery Channel or any promotional film.  This one really sucks.  A thrills ride dvd is having the camera recording forward as the coaster runs a full lap.  It doesn't happen on this promotion film dvd.,1152662400,15,484,4.528735632183908
7989581,1,B000094FG6,"this is a poorly made video. It's a poorly researced supposedly 'independent' guide to the best rollar coasters. However, strangely, only coasters on the west coast are highlighted and even more strange Magic mountain seems to be the center of attention.

Some of these coasters look good, but a roller coaster guide that doesn't include Ohio or Florida is at best incomplete.",1140566400,6,376,5.064516129032258
7989582,2,B000094FG6,"This is hardly a survey of ""Extreme"" coasters, but actually a boring overview of California and Nevada roller coasters. In fact, I'd call this DVD the ""Six Flags Magic Mountain"" show. At least half of the coasters profiled here would NOT be considered ""extreme"" by most seasoned coaster buffs. Thus, the title is really misleading and that's just BAD marketing and design. There is a lot of repetitious footage, particularly where it appears there would be commercial interruptions. There's way too much of Mr. Ruben's standard, pedantic, rehearsed commentary which seems to show up in so many DVD's and documentaries of recent years. It's time for other authorities. For two hours this DVD goes on way too long. I only (and reluctantly) finished watching it to make sure my copy was not defective, though I'll probably not watch it again, except for possibly the shots of ""X"". I have seen (and own) a lot of roller coaster/amusement park video material and this is one of the worst. Avoid this one, unless you have got to have footage of  coasters from this part of the U.S.",1130716800,9,1075,4.8108108108108105
7989583,4,B000094FG6,"When it comes to roller coaster dvd's, there are unfortunately only two choices: you het either an exciting dvd that shows roller coaster rides from your (among others) point of view but gives no information about the coaster whatsoever, or the dvd gives a lot of interesting information but hardly shows any rides.

This is the latter type of dvd. It is very educational and believe me, very interesting. It shows old footage, interviews and a lot of coasters, and does so with a very fast pace. It will keep you interested throughout the movie, but this is not more than a movie. You won't see much of the rides, and it is not a thrill to experience. If that is what you're looking for, I'd recommend buying ""America's greatest roller coaster thrills"". Buy this one as a bonus if you have any extra money, you won't regret it.",1118361600,14,828,4.557046979865772
