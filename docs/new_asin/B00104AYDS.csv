Walter, in all his brilliance, takes you through the decades with exquisite humanity and entertainment.  In perfect Cronkite style, he tells you the history in story form, in the courtesy of his own home, and you FEEL at home watching him.  This environment makes the learning experience more memorable and personal, and he helps you understand some of the most significant events in our history.

I think every classroom should have this, I think every parent should watch this with their children.  This is one of those DVDs that if I were wealthy, I would buy thousands of copies and hand them out on the street.  Absolutely worth while!",1518220800,,790,4.688405797101449
8236767,5,B00104AYDS,"As always, Walter Cronkite's commentary is excellent and to the point.  The videos were fun because they brought back memories of news events that were covered with a view to the facts and history in mind rather than individual newscaster opinions.",1448150400,2,248,5.048780487804878
8236768,4,B00104AYDS,"I agree that this is a great set. Walter Cronkite, the man who introduced the outside world to many young baby boomers and gen-x'ers who watched him along with our parents in the 60s and 70s, lived through much of the 20th century and tells us about it along with the news films. The film excells when our man stops the action with some well told anecdotes. Among the most interesting are the ones involving a horrific encounter that he ahd his father had with a racist doctor who cruelly assaulted a black delivery boy in Texas as a child, the lady who makes a crank call shortly after JFK's assassination, and his daugther's attempt at hippie rebellion. As a child, I was attracted to Cronkite's storytelling abilities and this is put to VERY good use here. His tales about John F. Kennedy (along with some previously unseen footage of an interview with Kennedy on Vietnam) show a side to Kennedy that is not often seen or discussed these days.

However, I am a history teacher and if you want you use this for your classroom, be warned that Mr. Cronkite covers most of the issues involved rather hastily for students who are not familiar with the depths of the importance of these events. I understand that some other Cronkite videos do a  better job with background material. But for Cronkite and history fans, this is very good.",1311811200,,1333,4.5966386554621845

8236770,5,B00104AYDS,"This is wonderful nostalgia folks.  Walter is a great story teller and you get a history lesson to boot.  This man had a front seat on what was happening during our lifetime and it's fun to relive with him, like being behind the lines.  Great footage mixed in too.  Enjoy.",1255737600,5,272,4.38
