996244,2,6305248869,The performances were fine but the script was weak as the plot. The good things are the funny scenes that you watch in the trailers and no more the rest is a superficial and stupid story. But the funny are very great I  really laugh.,925344000,,233,4.177777777777778

996380,3,6305248869,"Cameron Diaz plays kind of a girl next door type full of bouncy sunshine that makes every guy she meets fall in love with her.  The good the bad and the everything else.  She has kind of slow dim witted brother who beats up everybody that likes her.  You have to see this movie to understand the bean and franks scene, the hair gel scene and things like that.  A dog get's electrocuted and other fun stuff.  But this is a funny movie.",1521849600,,434,4.180722891566265

996607,5,6305248869,"Naturally the first of its kind it is very funny. Ted Stroehmann had a slight accident requiring Magda (Lin Shay) to do a little triage. This messes up his prom night with Mary Jensen. Mary moves to is last scene moving to Florida. Later in years he decides to rectify this. Ted heirs a detective, Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), to find Mary. The report is disappointing however he still peruses her and in the process has some interesting experiences. Some will make your hair stand on end. Soon he finds that there is not a clear track as he is one of many admirers.

Will Ted and Marry get together?
Will they want to?
And what about Pat who fell in love also?

Cameron, blue eyed natural blond from California, had already been in ten movies so she was well known at the time of this movie. The script and part fit her well. Off screen she has a sense of humor that could appreciate the sight gags.

Ben Stiller has been in several films before and since he always plays the same character. He has been pigeonholed a sort of modern day bathroom humor slapstick.",1504828800,,1059,4.392857142857143

I watched this years ago when it came out and thought it was funny, but those were clearly different times for me, and possibly different times for people in society. Now, to see it, and to see how autism was made a joke out of, is truly disturbing and shameful. Not to mention blatant sexism and homophobia. I'm happy, that we've evolved and movies like this would never see the screen today.

There so much going on it was a pleasure to get it on DVD. I find myself rewinding the movie to hear what was said. I tend to laugh very loudly when watching this film.

The basic plot of boy falls for a beautiful girl in high school, only to loose her to a very uncomfortable zipper issue. Hires a scumbag PI who, like many other men, turn into stalkers. The jokes are many, the acting is great, as is the movie.

From the zipper to Brett Fav re, to fake pizza delivery man, this movie delivered ! There is something about Mary !",1469404800,3,651,4.118110236220472

998097,5,6305248869,"There's Something About Mary is a comedic film that features Cameron Diaz in a star-making title role together. It is a film by the Farrelly brothers that combines romantic comedy and gross humor.

The film starts when an awkward and shy 16-year-old high-school student named Ted Stroehmann lands a prom date with his dream girl Mary Jensen. Unfortunately,it was cut short by a painful and embarrassing zipper accident. After he suffers from the ordeal of pain and embarrassment, Ted end up in the hospital after the incident and loses touch with Mary. Thirteen years later, Ted is still in love. He hires a private investigator to find her and tries to win her once more now that it would be more challenging considering that he finds her a successful orthopedic surgeon residing in Miami.

This was definitely an unforgettable film. One main reason is the fact that we here see a great looking,sexy and charming Cameron Diaz who is on her way to stardom before she changed into becoming the premiere actresses for bitches in movies such as The Counselor,Vanilla Sky and Charlie's Angels. Probably,it was also a time wherein she still signs autographs from fans. Anyway,she definitely portrayed the charm and appeal of Mary extremely well.

As for the story,it was also able to handle romantic comedy and gross out humor together magnificently. While it maybe offensive and raunchy in many scenes,it also was able to become insightful when it comes to romance. Viewers will definitely feel the love that a romantic comedy rarely provides. Ben Stiller was definitely in top form during the production of the film.

And most of all,give credit to the Farrelly brothers for arguably making their best film ever. In it,the movie makes fun of manners,political correctness,moral values and being polite but nevertheless they only made the viewer aware that we are capable of great sense of humor only known to us - human beings.

The three reasons stated above makes it deserving of all the accolades and commercial success that it received during it theatrical release.",1418515200,,2066,5.011661807580175

There's Something About Mary is a movie that you should definitely own for yourself or give to someone you care about for a fun holiday gift.  There's Something About Mary was a hit from 1998.  Below I have included a brief description.

There's Something About Mary features Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller. The movie is directed by Farrelly brothers (Bobby and Peter). The movie is funny and has some iconic scenes in it that will have you laughing after the movie is over. Readers of Total Film magazine voted There's Something About Mary the 4th greatest comedy film of all time.

I feel this movie would make a great gift for yourself or a holiday gift, and I would definitely recommend it.

HILARIOUS!! wtf - seriously. Like the famous hair scene - could have been funny. I like a little crude humor - I'm no Einstein. But after I laughed it just went on and on. Do people really need this much prompting to get the joke? People kept telling me that this was my kind of movie - it was SO FUNNY - the most hilarious movie EVER.

Just like The Hangover and American Pie, etc - geared toward audiences who require simplicity and repeition in order to ""get it."" I get it. Enough already.",1385337600,3,892,4.47239263803681

 This funny, little film involves two men fighting over the same woman when one of the men tries to track down his teenage sweetheart. What follows are gags of plenty, an extremely well-written script, and more laughs than an audience can handle.

 ""There's Something About Mary"" made over $300,000,000 at theatres, way above expectations for a comedy film and as of 2011 it still ranks as one of the funniest films ever made.

 The DVD comes with informative audio commentaries, deleted scenes, and much more.

999451,4,6305248869,"Ah, the Farrelly brothers.  This is what, their masterpiece?  Who am I to deny them that?  This is most likely their finest film, although I am not the biggest fan of their work so that isn't saying a whole lot.  But, maybe it is.  The fact remains that, while I am not a gigantic fan of their work in general, I am a pretty big fan of this film.  It's fun, funny and entertaining.

And believe me, there IS something about Cameron Diaz.

The film follows lovesick Ted as he attempts to track down Mary, the girl of his dreams.  He knew her in high school and actually had a shot with her until a horrible accident caused a riff of embarrassment that followed Ted into his adult life.  Ted hires a loser named Healy to track her down.  Healy, a complete jerk, becomes smitten with Mary (because she's hot) and so he feeds Ted a slew of lies to get him off her trail and then goes in for the kill himself.  Mary is successful and wealthy and looking for the right guy.  Ted decides to pursue her regardless of the fact that, according to Healy, she is a wheelchair bound fatty with a slew of children and no money.

Ah, love is in the air.

`There's Something About Mary' doesn't nail every gag.  The Farrelly brothers have their own style and it doesn't always work to their advantage.  That said, when they do nail it, they nail it hard.  In fact, every scene with that hilarious mutt named Puffy is just brilliant, and far funnier than the obsessed about hair-gel scene.  The fight scene with Puffy had me in tears it was so funny, and the resuscitation scene still gets me in full barrel laughs.

The vulgarity here can be harsh, but it's also used in such a breezy nature that it becomes a part of the film, something light and airy and fun.

Ben Stiller is really good at what he does (far better than Adam Sandler) and he always nails these types of roles.  Matt Dillon is hilarious here, hilariously EVIL!  Lin Shaye is ridiculous.  I mean, she's funny to look at really.  Her leathery skin and disturbing love of her dog is just one of the many reasons to point and laugh when she is on the screen.  But, as the title of the film suggests, this is all about Mary, and as Mary, Cameron Diaz is marvelous.  She is certainly the funniest thing about the film, and her natural, carefree, ditzy-yet-SMARTER-THAN-YOU take on the character is classic!  She nails every scene with a needed conviction, and her dramatic scenes are all tainted with enough humor to make her character completely believable and wholly adorable.

The New York Film Critics Circle was right that year!

It's not perfect, but it's a laugh riot and one that I can truly recommend.  There is a lot of hype surrounding this one for those who have never seen it.  It isn't the godsend of all comedies, but it is definitely noteworthy and worth taking the time to see.",1269820800,2,2840,4.401923076923077
999452,4,6305248869,"This was the most unfunny alleged ""comedy"" I have ever seen. I can't say I laughed once, or even smiled, although I did wince at the famous zipper scene. I think my most common emotion was puzzlement that anyone would think any of this movie was funny. And it's not because I don't like offensive, tasteless humor. I laughed throughout ""South Park,"" which had something to offend everyone, but still managed to be uproarious in its gross-out humor.  Cameron Diaz was unbelievably cute, so it's no wonder all the guys were hot for her. But Ben Stiller has been playing nerdy, neurotic guys for too long. With Stiller and Meara for parents, what happened to his comedy genes? Matt Dillon was terrific; I didn't even recognize him. I have no idea what the critics who liked this movie were thinking of. Or even not thinking of. Don't bother.",1253059200,2,838,4.662162162162162
999453,4,6305248869,"This is my favourite Farrelly Brothers film as it still manages to entertain without dumbing down too much to the audience unlike ""Dumb and Dumber"" which I hate with a passion.  This comedy also has a nice moral in it about the difference between love and obsession/lust and the merits of perseverence in relationships; the outrageousness of the antics of Mary's suitors is what makes the film work as well as the daringness at the time to use so many taboo topics just slays me everytime I watch this.  I also liked the tribute to Nat King Cole in that other criminally underrated comedy spoof of the Western genre ""Cat Ballou"" although Nat's counterpart does a whole lot more singing than Richman's who just plays the drum here.  Needless to say, Richman isn't worthy to carry Nat King Cole's sandals when it comes to vocal and star quality.

This dvd is strangely bare special features-wise for a Special Edition although the picture quality is very good and so is the sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound mode. Certainly controversial and not everyone's cup of tea but for those who are able to not take this film too seriously as it is a comedy after all may find that this film falls under that rare quality of a comedy that ages pretty well.",1250121600,,1268,4.622222222222222

It's great. Not only are the jokes as funny as hell, but at the same time there's a very interesting story to watch. This is a cult classic comedy.

999534,2,6305248869,"Well, Ben Still is a zero. I knew that. I have never been other than annoyed by him, which, fortunately has not been often. But this one came so highly recommended that I finally plunged in. Oh, is this a dumb film. Oh my. It is stupid and ugly and insulting and creepy and sad. How many laughs can we get from a guy getting his privates stuck in a zipper? 15 minutes worth? Yow--that's more than milking a joke, that's making hard cheddar from a joke that wasn't that funny (and is ridiculously implausible to begin with in every way.) There were rare moments of humor, but few and vary, very far between. This is not a zero film, or even a one, but two is certainly stretching it.

No need to write more on this. This was a film that left me ice cold, not the slack jawed dumbfoundment that anyone anywhere under any circumstances could like it, as I have felt on occasion, but a sad lonely feeling that these jokes could be found amusing by anyone over the age of about twelve.

I bought the Collector's Edition (fortunately, very cheaply) and I cannot imagine circumstances under which I will want to devote any more of my life to this limp, saggy, and stupid movie. Disc 2 will remain unused for as long as I own it.",1206576000,5,1221,4.304347826086956

""There's Something About Mary"" is the story of Ted (Ben Stiller), a lonely guy who has been in love with his high school prom date, Mary (Cameron Diaz), ever since they shared the most horrifying pre-date experience possible. Thirteen years later, Ted still can't get Mary out of his mind. He hires Patrick (Matt Dillon), a sleazy private investigator, to track Mary down. Unfortunately, when Patrick gets a good look at Mary, he decides that he wants her all to himself. Patrick concocts a wild scheme to keep Ted and Mary apart, but Ted eventually figures out what's going on and embarks on a hellish journey down to Florida to set things straight. It turns out that many more men have become smitten with Mary, and it's anyone's guess what will happen in the end.

This movie is incredibly funny. There is definitely some humor in it that I would usually consider uncouth (bathroom scenes, anyone?), but even I couldn't keep myself from laughing.

999584,3,6305248869,"I love comedies and wasn't quite sure about this one.  Ben Stiller plays this kind of dorky guy who wants Mary (Cameron Diaz).  She ends up asking him to the prom and then everything gones wrong.  The best parts of the movie for me, is when he gets his male organ stuck in his prom tux zipper and had to go to the hospital, they actually showed it!  Soon after that Mary moved to Miami and the rest of the movie centers on how Ben Stiller finds her.  He paid Matt Dillon (a kind of self-centered investigator) to track her, but he too falls in love as does a pizzaboy/architect and Ben's best married friend with some sort of dermatitis.  The problem getting to Mary's heart was her retarded brother, who beats everyone up. He is good for a few laughs, though.  Another highlight was the characterization of Mary's next door neighbor, Magda, that comes for a visit, but never leaves Mary's apartment.  Magda is your typical Miami old ""too-much-sun"" lady.  Her skin is between orange and brown and we get very scary shot (FOR YOU HORROR/PORROR BUFFS)of her sagging boobs.  Of course, in the end, Ben Stiller gets Mary.  I'd rent this, not buy it, save your money.  Though it was good for a few laughs.  The collector's edition has a few extras for a couple of additional laughs.",1185840000,2,1277,4.5

Ted hears she is living in Miami and hires a scumbag detective (Matt Dillion) to track her down. From there all sorts of wacky hijinks ensue- involving Puffy the dog on speed, a psychopathic murderer and Mary trying on Ted's organic ""hair gel"".

Slapstick comedy has long been a part of Hollywood cinema. But this film takes it to a new level with its hilariously disgusting gags and over the top silliness. It's a sort of ""stupid"" movie for smart people. The plot is outrageous and all the characters, besides Ted and Mary, are idiots. This is, of course, very much intentional on the part of the Farrelly brothers. I suppose the point might be that these two good hearted souls still manage to find each other despite all the liars, phonies and bad fortune. But the social satire still takes a back seat to the comedy as this movie ranks very high on the ""laughs per minute"" meter.

This is a funny movie with excellent characters. I have watched it several times now and I think it is funnier with each viewing.

There are long, dull stretches here between the gross out jokes, and the drama (for lack of a better word) is really tedious.  Of course, the attitude towards sex is extraordinarily childish (which is the point), and the film is extremely stupid.  In many ways, this film exemplifies what kind of films were popular in the 1990's; gross out films with idiotic characters and really stupid behaviour and situations.  I never found this film to be actually funny.  The Naked Gun type films can be quite dumb at times, yet they're funny.  This film has a few mild laughs, but mostly it's painfully unfunny.  On a plus, this film doesn't have the smugness a lot of 90's films had, but that doesn't make it much better.  So, if you're in the mood for stupid, stupid, and stupid, this film will do it for ya.

999686,3,6305248869,"""There's Something About Mary"" is like many cheesey romantic comedies, except that is has more heart and more big laughs.  One of the best aspects about Mary is that she is attracted to the integrity of men and not just their appearance. Ted (Ben Stiller) is an awkward teenager with braces who wins the heart of Mary (Carmen Diaz) when he shows the character and courage to defend her handicapped brother.  He then garners a chance to take her to the prom, but a terrible accident cuts off their relationship, and leaves Ted yearning for her even after she moves to Miami.  Through a friend, he hires a private investigator, Pat, (Matt Dillon) to find her.  A slimeball from the start, he chases Mary himself and attempts to leave Ted in the dust.

""There's Something About Mary"" is meant to be in bad taste, but for humor, sometimes it hits and sometimes it misses.  Fortunately, it bats at about .750 and manages some grand slams.  Mary is truly captivating enough to enable decency, but the treatment of the handicapped is a mixed bag.  Special people are a touchtone to the characters, but there are a few cheap jokes involving the handicapped as well.  Ben Stiller manages again to play Mr. Ordinary who is thrown into the worst of circumances, like in ""Meet the Parents,"" and remain a nimble and nuerotic presence.  It is a fun movie for all its hijinx and even (sometimes especially) the cheese...(including, notably a guest appearance by Chief Cheese, Brett Farve...)",1148947200,,1476,4.752941176470588
999687,3,6305248869,"The Farelly brothers who have in the past delivered such cinematic masterpieces as KINGPIN and DUMB AND DUMBER, are back at what they do best, and they are bigger, (maybe) better and (definitely) more gross than ever. Boldly throwing caution and any semblance of good taste to the wind, they deliver a chuckle-fest that might shock, disgust, and repel, but will without fail leave the viewer in splits.

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is in fact a sublime lesson on how to twist the simplest of storylines into a signature style of story-telling that is bound to leave an impact in the minds of viewers even weeks after they have seen it. ""Politically incorrect"" is an understatement when it comes to TSAB. The Farrellys don't spare anyone in their effort to attain new levels of snot-inducing toilet humour. Helpless animals, obese folks, handicapped guys, senior citizens are all targets of gags. Maybe the next edition of Oxford's will have a picture of Peter and Bobby Farrelly next to Gross and Tasteless. There is liberal usage of various bodily parts and function which make for most of the visual gags, right from a close up shot of what Ted has gotten stuck in his zipper, to a disgusting shot of fake sagging boobs in all their glory, and the infamous masturbation, or as it is more popularly know, the ""hair-gel"" episode.

The storyline is no great burden on the brain. Rhode Island loserboy Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) has a major crush on Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz), just like every other guy on campus. However, him being the proverbial dorky-geek-with-braces-but-with-heart-of-gold, she asks him to the prom anyway. However, on the big day, thing go horribly wrong with Ted (guys would understandably sympathize more), and he has to be whisked away to the hospital. Mary's family moves to Miami, and since then, he has had no contact with her. Now, thirteen years after graduation, he finds out he still longs for her. So he hires a sleazeball investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down. Time to introduce the love triangle. Pat falls for her hook, line, and sinker. Getting back, he paints a real bleak picture of Mary, with her being overweight, unwed with children, and now working as a mail order bride. However Ted being who he is, not-so-dorky-anymore-but-still-a-loserboy-with-a-heart-of-gold, decides to meet her anyway. The rest of the movie is as predictable as the state of our roads during monsoon, but the potholes on the way are custom-made to hit you when least expected.

While not needing any great displays of acting prowess, everyone in the movie is just fine in their roles. Cameron Diaz is totally believable as the beautiful and cheery-as-sunshine sweet little small-town girl, who has everyone falling for her. Ben Stiller comic timing is unquestionable, with an equally good ability to get a fair amount of ""awwws"" when he does his droopy sad looks. Sleaze has never been defined better than with Matt Dillon's character, and he runs away with some of the best lines in the movie.

The supporting cast is as good as headliners. Lee Evans as Tucker, Mary's friend, shines in a role as a physically handicapped architect. W. Earl Brown, as Mary's retarded brother is fine in a role that doesn't require much of him except to be the scapegoat for a number of offensive gags. Chris Elliott as Dom, Ted's best friend passes muster.

However, the show-stealer would have to be the little dog belonging to Magda (Lin Shaye), Mary's raunchy old-as-the-hills neighbour. Involved in a vicious man-animal wrestling match with Ted, and the centre of an extended sight gag where Pat has to revive it from its unconsciousness, the dig gives a voracious display of canine capers.

I also loved the use of Jonathan Richman as the guitar-toting guy, with his bongo-busting sidekick, who keeps popping up with songs meant to let us in on the state on Ted's progress.

So what would be the downer? Well, for one, the sight gags sometimes fail to deliver, or get to be a bit too disgusting to be palatable. Plus at times, the movie is dry without any comic parts. The most obvious flaw in the movie would be that it has a hard time deciding what exactly it wants to convey. Well scripted, emotional parts are rudely interrupted with toilet humour, and conversely, at times, the toilet gags are used to convey a deeper message.

This movie has an appeal that is hard to ignore. Even the strictly serious art-films-only type of killjoys will be hard pressed to stiffle their laughter. Oscar material this is not, but recommended to anyone looking for a good time.",1146787200,5,4591,4.854406130268199

Mary is a story about a Rhode Island loser named Ted, played by Stiller, who can't keep his high school dreamgirl Mary, played by the charming Diaz, out of his mind 13 years after their prom date went terribly wrong way before it happened. He hires an obnoxious guy named Patrick, played by Dillon, to spy on her and tell him what she's been up to. Well, Patrick falls for Mary, and decides to move out to Florida where she resides to get to know her, and he does. Ted discovers that Patrick isn't giving him the truth about Mary and goes out to find her himself. It turns out that Mary has many admirers who try to win her heart (or shoes!) besides the lonely Ted. So the movie becomes a race on who can get her first and forever.

It's a silly tale but under the Farrellys direction, it's a surefire laugh-fest all the way through. Expect to see lots of sick humor like a guy giving a dog CPR, or bodily fluids used as toiletries. Also, the characters in Mary are funny by nature. The funniest character of them all is Warren, Mary's handicapped and heavy set brother, who punches people who touch his ears and loves to give piggy back rides.

As you've no doubt know, this is a love story brought to you by the folks who did 'Dumb & Dumber' and 'Kingpin', neither of which I have any interest in watching. Any SNL fans will recognize some of the scene styles. Still, there's something about this movie that makes it worth watching.

I mean I know that tastes differ, but I think people may have been expected something this one couldn't possibly deliver. As a comedy, it is absolutely phenomenal. I really have to say that it's the only movie of the nineties that can match up with Stripes or Animal House. It's utterly amazing.

There's Something about Mary is a mlange of every kind of comedy. There's slapstick, physical situation, and intellectual social satire. This movie made Ben Stiller and rightly so. I recall seeing it in the theatre and not being able to breathe at times due to the convulsions erupting from my abdomen. No time was this more true than when Stiller walks into the gay rest stop and gets busted, but there are a million scenarios that could be cited. All the actors were sensational. Matt Dillon's character is exquisite in his cheesiness and he really excels in his role especially when he's playing football with the ""retards"" and showing off his sensitive side by pummeling them on the gridiron. Chris Elliot is exceptional in his role and any film that features Jonathan Richman that much is special and rare. I could not recommend this one any more.",1129248000,59,1230,4.747663551401869

999729,5,6305248869,"This movie was my first real experience of Ben Stiller and in the numerous times I have seen it, I have yet to tire of it. It endures as one of my favourite movies, and I hate romantic comedies as a rule! However, this is not your usual romantic comedy by any stretch of the imagination.

The story basically carries you along the life of angst ridden, therapy dependent and introverted Ted, (Stiller), as he tries to track down the one high school love he had. That would be Mary, (Diaz). In the process, he sends out a private detective with a host of his own problems, (Dillon), who also falls for this Mary. That is also in addition to the host of others who have fallen for this girl. Throw in a serial killer, a gay bust at a roadside rest stop, Puffy the dog and some healthy doses of speed, and great comedy is what you have.

Stiller is great as the pathetic and somewhat anal-retentive Ted. The role seems excellently suited to Stiller's style of acting and character. He really shines in this movie, and it is largely his work here that has got me to be a large fan of his. Diaz comes across well as the sports loving, butch, but-so-sexy-at-the-same-time perfect woman, Mary. Both of them lack some of the chemistry of other on-screen love interests, but that lack is hardly noticeable in the chaos of the comedy.

Be warned that there is a lot of sexuality used in the jokes, and that some of it is pretty sick. However, overall, the comedy is truly great, even if it has a sick moment or two.

I laughed myself almost to oxygen starved loss of consciousness. I have seen the movie perhaps more than 10 times, and I am not yet bored of it. If comedy of a high standard and only many levels, (some crude levels, too), is your thing, I would recommend you get this movie. It is great!",1119830400,21,1794,4.3462686567164175

In this movie you a young boys infatuation with the one who got away in high school-- the new girl Mary(Diaz) who is the girl in high school that just has it all sensitivity, looks, and charisma. She actually goes to prom with Ted(Stiller) who has the geeky hair and braces. Only problem is prom never happens after Stiller has a problem in the bathroom when he accidently hits the ""frank"" when zipping up his fly. Many years later still consumed with Mary-- Ted decides to her down hiring a dective who also falls for Mary. The dective makes up a story about Mary to Ted about her being 200 pounds and in a wheel-chair to turn Ted off while he moves to go be close to Mary. Mary hasn't changed at all and when Ted learns about where Mary is he decides to see her. Things haven't changed and their still is a connection with her. Then, the world comes crashing in when Ted learns that is not the only one who sees there is something about Mary-- her admirers include someone obssesed with shoes, a pro-football player, a class a- jerk, a pizza guy, and Ted who never got over Mary. All in all this a hilliarou comedy! One to have in your collection!

All admit the storyline is a little too dim-witted at times jumping around from a axe-murderer hitchhiker, to a trip to the emergancy room on prom night, to a dog set on fire-- to the guy that loves Mary's shoes. I've watched  this movie over a 100 times and I still laugh everytime I see it-- I guess there is Something About Mary you just can't describe.

999802,5,6305248869,"I was about 13 or 14 when my family and I checked this flick out at the theater (I have hip folks, what can I say!). Zippers, hair-gel, Ben Stiller, and that crazy bro. Mary had - it's the late '90s, so put on your zoot suit, and pull a comb through your coal-black hair!

Much of ""Something About Mary's"" humor is about ""sticky"" situations, and I mean this literally and figuratively. . . It's crude (what other movie ends with the dialogue, ""I was only bonin' you to get to Mary?""), you bet - but it also has a charming good-naturedness about it that later, more cynical exercises in gross-out comedy (i.e. the ""American Pie"" trilogy) would lack. In fact, remember that guy from high school who was always trying way too hard to be the class clown? ""American Pie,"" and especially its sequels, are like that guy. His freshness wore out quickly, and he eventually became a self-conscious parody of himself.

The plot of ""Mary"" essentially revolves around a group of love-hungry boobs who desperately want to hook up with Mary. Stiller was her high-school prom-date; Chris Elliot was her college boyfriend, etc. Each guy tries to sabotage the other guys, and Mary is stuck in the middle of their kooky antics. Simple? Yes - but ""Mary's"" not supposed to be a weighty Oscar juggernaut steeped in critic-baiting societal metaphors - it's supposed to be fun. And trust me, it totally succeeds, here.

So, why should you check out ""There's Something About Mary"" now, instead of the more recent ""Pie"" movies, and such? ""Mary"" goes down like a bubbly can of sparkling Cherry Coke (or Surge, if you remember that! Damn, that was good stuff!), complete with a nostalgic buzz. Think blue skies, and an optimistic, pre-Bush America. ""Pie,"" and recent movies like it, go down like hard swallows from a plastic bottle of some over-syruppy, hyper-commericalized energy drink. Think smart-allecky smirks, and greasy foreheads. Which would you prefer?

The Farrellys navigate successfully the fine line between being laugh-out-loud funny and just plain gross superbly.  They are abetted by a superb cast.  Ben Stiller's nebbishy character get's tiresome in alot of his films but he is somewhat endearing here.  Cameron Diaz is effervescent here as the object of everybody's affection.  Matt Dillon has never been better as the sleazy private detective(where's he been lately?).  This film may have been a case of the Farrellys being too successful because their subsequent efforts have fallen short of the mark(though I'm one of the few champions of ""Me, Myself, and Irene"".  It's not as bad as some would say).  On a final note if anybody's interested in who the minstrel is who provides running commentary throughout the film his name is Jonathan Richman.  Richman and his band the Modern Lovers made a classic self-titled rock album in 1972.  Richman was something of an eccentric.  After the cult success of their initial album, Richman eschewed rock music and went on to make children's records.

Very entertaining for those who still give off childish giggles at silly bathroom and pecker jokes passed around their 6th grade class.

The main critic praises this film for having 'some genuine emotional content' but I found little in it that could appeal to anyone above the maturity level of a twelve-year old.  The defects in this film are much greater than just the 'simplistic camera work' claimed by the main reviewer.  Along with the camera work, the entire premise of this film is simplistic in terms of its immaturity (e.g. the idea that lust=love, silly dating games, masturbation scenes, semen used as hair gel, human fesces littering an apartment, etc., etc.)

I also though they should have kept the alternate beginning, which is in clay, but its really cool. They give you 2 options to watch the movie, the theatrical version and the extended version with 15 minutes of never before seen scenes. There are interactive menus, which are in clay that are cool. It also shows 43 minutes of behind the scene footage. This is a must get if you really love the movie.",1078790400,4,1747,4.313069908814589
999874,5,6305248869,"I must've seen this movie a hundred times, and it's still on my top 10 list.  It truly is laugh-a-minute stuff for anyone with even a vague sense of humor, while the gags run the gamut from ridiculous to sublime, the plot twists ands turns, and the characters are actually well-developed and distinctive, more so than you'd expect for what is essentially, a romantic comedy.  In my opinion too much attention has been paid to various scenes in the movie (I'm talking about clearing the pipes here...) and that shouldn't overshadow the many other hilarious bits.  I think it definitely is a movie you need to watch repeatedly to pick up on all the running jokes and more subtle humor.
It also helps that Cameron Diaz is pretty much every man's dream - beautiful, low maintenance and willing to date nerds. Ker-ching!
Stiller is fabulous as usual, gamely getting humiliated movie after movie, but I think this movie was his zenith, the peak of his powers and so-on.  he brings a smile to our faces, and at least once, tears to our eyes.
The supporting cast is also used effectively, with Lee Evans and Matt Damon in particular standing out.
The Farrelly brothers are the kings of skating the thin line between good and bad taste, funny and irritating. Here they come down solidly on the side of solid gold entertainment, although it appears many people here beg to differ as to which side of the line that is!

There is a lot of low-brow, crude humor in this movie. However, some of it is done tastefully enough that it doesn't seem offensive. Actually, very little of it is done tastefully. Most of it is completely tasteless and lacks any tact whatsoever (for instance the infamous ""hair gel"" scene). Cameron Diaz is beautiful to watch, but that's about her only purpose. She's a complete trophy woman and seems perfectly fine by that. Ben Stiller does have comic talent and is able to shine every now and again, but because of the poor script he really doesn't get to use his talents and instead becomes nothing more than a prop in some really sick practical jokes.

Still, there is a bit of a story and then there's that crazy band that narrates the movie with song. All of that, plus Cameron Diaz gets this picture 3 stars instead of 2. It's hard to believe that this is the Farrelly Brother's best picture they've ever made.",1075420800,,1222,4.524886877828054

These guys can take off-colored humor, outrageous sight gags, sophomoric gimmicks, recycled comedy, a hopelessly nerdy leading man (Ben Stiller), and still put together a very funny movie.  THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is pure tongue-in-cheek, towel-popping comedic bliss that makes fun of anything and everything--and offers no apologies.
This movie is a celebration of in-your-face sight gags:  a johnson caught in a zipper, a petrified dog revived by an electric jolt, a dash of ""all natural"" hair gel.  The visual comedy assaults you, wave after wave, and never lets up.  It's comedy you would expect to find in the third stall of the locker room, comedy so off-the-wall and immature you can't believe the sound of your own laughter.
Matt Dillon surprised me; this actor can flat out play a humorous role.  Cameron Diaz is perfect as Mary, the title character, while Ben Stiller is just. . .Ben Stiller.  While THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY doesn't break new comedic ground, it darn sure enhances the genre.  Granted, some of the stuff was lame, but I'm game.

Matt Dillon is terrific (and reminescent of Bruce Campbell) as a ""spy"" who falls in love with Mary; Chris Elliott falls in love with Mary; Lee Evans falls in love with Mary; just about everyone falls in love with Mary.

I'm assuming the few listed are the same. The music video is very disappointing as it's exactly the same as the end credits except it's full screen. I was expecting a full song about Mary from those guys with the guitar and drums who appear at different intervals throughout the movie. But no it's just the buttercup credit's song. The Karaoke feature is incidentally the exact same thing again just with words across the screen this time. They could have just had the subtitles feature available in the music video for the same effect. Usually Karaoke just has the instrumental music and not the words being sung. There is a theatrical trailer, director commentary and interactive menu but that's pretty much standard on any DVD so there?s nothing special there. The reason this annoys me is there?s a big icon on the cover that says ""Warning Crammed With Lots of Outrageous Special Features?""

There's Something About Mary is a definite movie to buy on DVD. It's the type of movie you can either watch in entirety or just watch bits of if short on time.

Cameron Diaz is Mary, a drop-dead gorgeous girl with a heart of gold. The story opens in high school as dorky Ted (Ben Stiller) prepares for a prom date with the wonderful Mary. They never get to the prom, however, and years later, he is still dreaming about the elusive Mary.
At his buddy (played by the hilarious, scene-stealing Chris Elliot)'s urging, Ted hires a private detective to find her. The detective (Matt Dillon) finds her and falls for Mary himself. There is also a crippled man who lusts after Mary. Through all this, the story is ""narrated"" by two unnamed musicians who pop up now and then and sing about the action.
There are so many hilarious scenes; the zipper, the dog, the hair gel, the hitchhiker; you've heard about all of them. This is one time when the movie lives up to the buzz. The video also includes outtakes and a music video made by the cast.
Cameron Diaz is so beautiful and funny that you cannot take your eyes off of her. Matt Dillon is billed over the hero, Ben Stiller. Dillion plays an over-the-top sleeze bag and is perfect in the part. Stiller doesn't have hero-good-looks, but he is a likeable everyman and has a great deadpan expression.

1000041,3,6305248869,"To everyone born in the late 1970s or thereafter:  You may now ignore this review.  You won't get it.  For those near age 30 or over, viewing this very popular comedy is marred by several things, not least of which is the use of such tired film cliches as the old ""misunderstanding in the interview room at the police station"" bit.  You know, the cops think the guy's done something heinous and the guy thinks the conversation is about a misdemeanor.  Har har.  That was boring and un-funny when JFK was in the White House.
Still, the film does have some hilarious scenes, especially with the dog.  The energy and spunk of such moments had me rolling in the floor.  Also the pizza guy is memorable for his remarkable level of physical control in some uncomfortable scenes where I was never sure if I should laugh or feel sorry for the guy; in retrospect, I'm just amazed at how limber the dude is.
The only reason I gave this three stars rather than two, however, is the presence of the luminescent Cameron Diaz.  This film would have been a flop without her.  She perfectly fulfills the role of the charming, gorgeous, sweet, transparent Mary.  If one could not understand why the male cast members would devote themselves to her pursuit, the film would fall to pieces.
The only reason I gave this three stars rather than FOUR, however, is the incredible stupidity it often shows.  Mary does WHAT for a living?  Nothing about her character ever leads us to think it's possible, other than a screenwriter using the vaguest outline of it by using her job title a couple of times.  Even when she's at work she seems out of place.  This is not sexism, but her personality, lifestyle, attitude, and mostly time away from the office, are such that one may as well believe she were a congresswoman.
And how about the odd device of separating the scenes with an on-screen musical interlude?  Pandering to the lowest level of audience intelligence, the idea is to tell about 20 to 25 minutes of story (just about the length of the TV sitcom, see, because they don't think you have enough focus to pay attention any longer than that and have to do a kind of ""commercial break"").
Worst, however, is the nonstop stream of ""F-bombs"" dropped without any rhyme or reason.  I'm strongly opposed to mindless crude language, and while there have certainly been examples of films that use such language well within the prose-like patter of tough-guy films like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" here we just have a bunch of [people] who can't think of anything more clever to say.  It's clear that the filmmakers did it just to ensure an R rating, so the young audience would think it was hipper than a PG13 film.
As I say, there is intermittent hilarity that make it worth watching once.  I won't be wasting my time with a second viewing, however.",1042848000,4,2837,4.604373757455268

Needing some help, he hires Pat (Matt Dillon), a collector and a guy who's pretty good about finding people. Pat comes through for Ted but then he realizes that he has another agenda with Ted's girl.

This is still one of my favorite movies of all time and probably my favorite from the Farrelly Brothers. Chris Elliot, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are hilarious in this one.

I am not a big Ben Stiller (Zoolander, Mystery Man) but this movie had my sides aching in certain sequences. Even Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels, Vanilla Sky, Shrek) has a few shinning moments. The story is about a kid who grows up with a crush on the most popular girl and then keeps that crush into adult hood. Through the suggestion of a friend played by Chris Elliot (The Abyss, Cabin Boy, Groundhog Day) he makes the suggestion of hiring a detective to find her years later. This detective is hysterically played by Matt Dillion (In and Out, To Die For, A Kiss Before Dying) and boy does he make you laugh.
The funniest scene stealer is that of a terrior dog who first get put on qualudes to be slowed up and then on speed to be more aggressive. Both scenes are hysterical and they are obvious ""dummy"" dogs, but Matt Dillion really plays the comedy to the hilt.
The DVD extra's include a funny and insightful commentary by the directors, a music video, a karaoke video and the outtakes from the film. Even the end credits are hysterical.

1000045,3,6305248869,"There's Something About Mary is probably the most famous gross-out comedy of them all, and certainly influenced the rest that came along in its wake, namely the American Pie movies.  At the end of the day you either like this kind of movie or you don't, and usually I don't but even for me this was good fun.  The story has three guys (Stiller, Dillon and Evans) in love with one girl, Mary (Diaz) and will do anything to get her.
The Farelly brothers have always revelled in being completely politically incorrect and crossing the boundaries of taste as often as they want to, something that is all too evident in There's Something About Mary.  However, it's definitely important that whilst these jokes might not be tasteful they are for the most part funny.  Whether they're laugh-out-loud funny or just raise a little smily depends on how much you go in for this kind of comedy or not.  Personally, I loved the scene where Matt Dillon tries to resuscitate Mary's dog with mouth-to-mouth and then with cords from a nearby lamp.  Of course the most famous scenes will probably be what most people look out for - Mary's mistake over the hair gel and Stiller's infamous zipper sequence - and they won't disappoint.
The only thing that provides the difficult point in this movie though is the ending.  It's sweet.  Now this will either appeal to you greatly, proving that the Farrelly brothers aren't afraid of sensitivity, or it will annoy you because it seems incongruous to the rest of the movie.  I'd probably go for the former, despite it being fairly predictable.  The acting is very good though, especially Diaz, who proves herself to be a real sport and again makes a statement that this is an actress of amazing versatility (just see Being John Malkovich) who can be light and funny or serious in equal parts.
There's Something About Mary might not be as quirky as it wants to be, but it was still very influential in its field and is way ahead of any other Farrelly brothers production to date.  Comedy with a twist it might not be but it's still well worth watching.",1038960000,3,2076,4.629427792915531

I wanted to recommend this movie.
I wanted to slap the director in the head with a shovel for using the ""F"" word in complete idiotic fashion.
Not that there's ever a GOOD time to use that word, but what was the point of just randomly throwing it in there almost a couple dozen times?
Some of the slapstick comedy is absolutely side splitting, fall out of your chair; laugh until you pee, really funny stuff.  Some of it really could have been funny if it hadn't been so blatantly ""in your face"" crude.  I think the comedy would have been there, without the obvious attempt to garner an ""R"" rating.
There were about four scenes that made the mood so uncomfortable that my wife and I almost shut it off before it finished playing.  Then when it was over, my wife commented that ""That's sure not a take your date out movie!"" translated ""You don't get any brownie points for picking out that trash!!""
Don't watch this movie if the ""F"" word offends you.
Don't watch this movie with your kids, unless you don't care about the masturbation question, premarital sex, or the ""F"" word.
Don't watch this movie with your girlfriend or wife thinking it's a ""chick flick"".

1000105,5,6305248869,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It is so hilarious, I think I have seen it about 50 times.  It is about a lonely writer, Ted(Ben Stiller), who has been thinking about his high-school crush, Mary(Cameron Diaz), for 13 years (the last time he saw her).  He longs to see her again so much that he hires a private investigator, Pat Healy(Matt Dillon), to track her down and spy on her a little bit.  Unfortunately, while Healy is spying on her, he falls in love with her.
  Healy then starts dating Mary and when Ted asks about Mary, Healy makes up lies and says things like, ""She's a mail order bride and she has 4 kids"".  With all this bad information about Mary, Ted still wants to see Mary, so he goes down to Miami and meets up with her.

After watching it for a second time after many months, it's not as bad as I remembered it being, but I still can't give it more than three stars.  The idea of the film is good (yet far from unique), and I am all for seeing dorky guys like myself stand a chance with the girl of their dreams, but the relentless crudity throughout the film takes away from my enjoyment.  I'm certainly not opposed to low-grade humor, but there are some images here that I could easily visualize myself without having to needlessly see them on screen.  I was also bothered by Mary's language--it just did not seem right for such a ""sweet"" young lady to say R-rated words.  That just does not fit with my own image of the character.  Admittedly, these are just personal reactions that others may not share.  I did find several parts of the movie quite funny, especially the initial prom night activities, but the level of humor seemed to steadily diminish throughout the film.  At the same time, my opinion of Ted (Ben Stiller) also declined significantly, and as a result I did not really care enough about the characters to have much of an emotional stake in the end.  I would have to say that this is a comedy and little else and consequently does not have much heart to it.  The love story aspect was destroyed for me by the excessive gross-out scenes and a somewhat farcical ending.  I don't know if it was bad acting or bad scripting, but none of the men supposedly madly in love with Mary seemed to portray any such feelings in their actions or dialogue.  I have never been a huge Cameron Diaz fan, but she does do a wonderful job here.  She can save a scene just by flashing that endearing smile of hers.",1021334400,3,1754,4.409937888198757

1000150,4,6305248869,"There's more than one thing about There's Something About Mary. To start with, we are dealing with the brothers Farrelly. America currently has several sibling teams making movies. The Zucker brothers [Airplane, The Naked Gun] and the Coen brothers [Fargo, The Big Lebowski] are acknowledged as gifted film makers.
Bobby and Peter Farrelly, however, make many reviewers quake in fear. Their aptly named Dumb and Dumber, starring Jim Carrey, was 1994's sixth most successful movie worldwide. The simple fact is that when a team can do that, a studio lets them make whatever they want for a while. Since this latest effort was the 4th biggest movie of 1998, there is even less chance of controlling their projects. They are what we call critic-proof.
Some reviewers, knowing they were powerless, made venomous assaults on Mary, based usually on the fact that the movie revels in its political incorrectness. There's no doubt about that, but others, myself included, saw it as one of life's guilty pleasures. After all, in a society currently so obsessed with toeing the line, with not offending even the smallest minority group, it can be fun to see a flick that threw all caution to the wind. A large segment of the population agreed.
So what groups do the Farrellys target this time around? They go after high schools kids, parents, gay men, straight men, sun worshippers, dogs, law enforcement officers, private detectives, the physically challenged, and the mentally challenged, among others. There is no agenda here. Their observations on the human condition seem to have no boundaries, and they simple did not have time to nail the entire planet.
To add insult to injury, this comedy is of the gross-out variety. As most of us write for general audiences, we were forced to be less than specific about much of the picture. All I should say in print is that the more memorable moments are the zipper scene, the hair gel scene, the biting dog episode, the binoculars incident, the run in at the rest stop, and a look at what real guys do just before a hot date.
So what is this thing about Mary? Part of it is that she is played by the fantastic Cameron Diaz, who I said would be a star after seeing her in My Best Friend's Wedding. I got that one right. The rest is the fact that Mary remains kind, helpful and innocent no matter what happens. While the rest of the characters fight, claw, scream and whine through life, Mary sails gracefully on.
Diaz has excellent support from Ben Stiller as Ted, who has never gotten over his high school crush on her, and from Matt Dillon as Pat, the sleazy private detective Ted hires to find her. It's no surprise when Pat decides to keep Mary for himself. That's the entire plot, by the way.
Throughout the movie, a vagabond keeps reappearing, singing an inane song about Mary and Ted. He eventually gets his, probably for singing off key. This element is a dead giveaway that the movie is a farce and a put on. For anyone trying to comment seriously on it, the joke seems to be on them.",1017187200,3,3030,4.676029962546816

She loves to golf, watch sportscenter, and talk about football. Yet she has a large group of worthless men chasing after her.

1000155,5,6305248869,"There's Something About Mary is, simply put, one of the funniest comedies of the 1990s.  It's not as sophiticated or innovative as Rushmore or Being John Malkovich, but it never attempts to aim this high.  The Farrellys only want to entertain their audience, and they accomplish this task ten-fold.
A lot of attention was put on the gross-out gags during the film's initial release, but these moments only tell part of the story.  What really puts Mary over the edge are the smaller moments, and a lot of that credit has to go to Matt Dillon.  As the shady, none-to-bright claims investigator Pat Healy, Dillon gives of the best best performances of his career.  Healy is a terrific comic invention, a man so unaware of his repulsiveness he actually thinks he's being sensitive when he tells Mary he ""loves to work with retards"".  Healy is the ultimate Farrelly character, a man who is so completely out-of-touch that he doesn't notice how much a fool he makes of himself.  It's a performance that would make W.C. Fields proud.
The other performances are solid as well.  Cameron Diaz is perfectly cast as Mary, a woman that defines female perfection from a male's point-of-view, and Ben Stiller began honing his screen persona, an everyman up against circunstances beyond his control, with this break-out role.  But nobody defines Mary's success as much as Dillon and the Farrellys' innate comedic geniuses.  Not every single scene works, but it hits on so many right notes that it remains a bonafide comedy classic.",1005177600,,1516,4.88671875

Ben Stiller plays an old high school friend who was to take Mary to the prom, when an unfortunate zipper accident occurs in her house. We jump forward years later and Stiller enlists the help of private eye Matt Dillon to find Mary for him. While he does this, Dillon falls in love with her himself. Ben Stiller is a master at this. Look at all his work and you'll see why. Matt Dillon shines in a hilarious role that shows his not much seen comedic side. Cameron Diaz is funny, but not the funniest. She also needs to eat something. Fast. The real standout was Earl Brown as Mary's retarded Brother, and Lin Shaye as Magda, Mary's apartment manager. The film goes from one hysterical joke to another. I couldn't stop laughing. It's also always nice to see Chris Elliot on the screen. This is a non-stop gas that is sure to entertain all.

The performers are all charming in their own way, and a clever piece of characterisation in the script avoids the temptation to make all the handicapped people 'cute'. Cameron Diaz is outstanding, although I inwardly sighed when her character misses the irony implicit in the term 'Politically Correct' and actually criticises someone for NOT being P.C. Ben Stiller is annoying as an eighteen year old, but grows on you as he gets older. W.Earl Brown is great as Warren, giving his characterconvincing physical mannerisms and the right mixture of menace and loveability.

There aren't that many comedies that you can pick up something new each time you watch it.
Cameron Diaz, though it was not her first movie, makes her REAL debut in this film.  It is a great one.  For a comedy, the plot is somewhat complex, but not so much that it is distracting.  I also enjoyed all the rediculous complaints from the politically correct viewers who complained that the movie promotes animal cruelty and belittles the mentally retarded.  I disagree on both counts.

Quite frankly, the only thing going for this movie is the fact that we get to see Cameron Diaz as often as we do. I postponed watching this for quite some time, over suspicion that much of the hype around it at the time of release was overrated. However, after its survival through the first couple of years as some sort of classic, I figured the Farralley brothers must have gotten something right. Furthermore, their earlier works were quite impressive, and so I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps the pumped up expectations made the disappointment worse. The film was simply not funny. The endless array of slapstick and phallic humor, while initially mildly entertaining, became monotenous. Carefully placed, such moments can add greatly to a comedy's enjoyment, as in ""American Pie."" Furthermore, in this film, besides the dull, repetive ""humor"" scenes, it was very difficult for the viewer to relate to the characters. Obsession over lost high school love can work successfully as a humorous plot until the utter implausibility and stupidity outweighs any sort of comical value. At best, it was a poor backdrop to introduce the subsequent drama. Despite what Ms. Diaz may say about her character, the ""idealization"" of Mary is a message the Farralleys are eager to convey. From the days of Figaro operas and perhaps into ancient Greece, ""ideal"" women and moronic suitors have been the centerpiece of comedies. Such an idealization is in and of itself quite harmless. Yet it fails when the foolishness of this character is treated as naivete, rather than blunders on a par with those of her male counterparts. Mary is ever-so good natured in her view of people, and to be frank comes across as childish. She is never given the opportunity to be remotely canaving or scheming as the other characters. This creates a dull, onesided portrait even for a comedy. To be sure, the film had its good moments, as when Stiller's character is interrogated. This was, sadly, the last of such clever maneuvers. The film is unmistakably one of the most overrated films I have ever watched.",989452800,8,2182,4.868279569892473

The first thing I'll mention about this movie is the plot itself. My friends warned me that it was ""eye-rolling annoying how PER CHANCE every guy in the movie was in love with Mary"". (I noted that, in fact, this was the point of the film). And since in annoying American movies (no offense), the girl who everyone is in love with in is annoyingly (that word again! ack! sorry, I will try to use it less) sweet, hot (but doesn't know it, OF COURSE!), smart, a real goody-goody... blah, blah, blah. The kinda girl you wanna punch, if I were to be frank. But likely Mary wasn't like that..too much. I mean, there was that ""I don't need men I have my viberator"" comment, and she DOES go see sports. So, hmmm.... I'll give her a second chance. How generous of me. The plot could be a snore. A girl who everyone is obbsesive about? A guy who sends a detective to find her? The dectective falls in love with the girl> Girl and boy live happily ever after? Snore, right? WRONG!!! This movie is funny! Besides the hair-gel thing (I myself loved it... but this is a heated arguement), the other great scenes were the first date, (people, thank your gods or whoever you want to thank, that this did NOT happen to you. surely, you'd die.), the ""are-you-gay"" scene, the scene with the hitch-hiker.... of course, you don't have to have a very sopistcated sense of humor to laugh at the jokes in this movie.

By now, you should know that their movies contain about a handful of sex-related jokes. But, they are undeniably the funniest movies in the galaxy.  I love how, in the beginning of Farrely brothers' movies, the first few scenes are from years back and they eventually go to the present day. Seeing the main characters' develop as funny then and are still presently funny is a gem.  The way it is done in ""There's Something About Mary"" is brilliant and, I think it teaches a very good lesson. The character Ted (Ben Stiller) is overall, a ""loser"", but he is a nice person and a kind person and he ends up getting the prom date with the prom queen. That teaches a lesson in addition to being hilarious. The plot of this movie is very good and it is not very far-fetched, fortunately.  The only complaint is that the ending is very predictable.

1000341,5,6305248869,"In the annals of cinema comedy where will the Farrelly brothers finally reside? Soon after their first venture into film they were labeled as what can only be described as the eminent caretakers of teen comedy. To their  credit they compounded this accusation by returning, in later films, to the  material that garnered that reputation in the first place. Steeped in gross  out gags, replete with fart jokes, the Farrelly brothers are perceived by  those that vote with their pen rather then their dollar as the kings of low  brow drudgery.
For those of you that have not seen There's Something  About Mary, which if you allow me a tinge of prognostication is probably  fairly close to none of you, I implore you to seek and see this movie. If I  were a person contained within your limited sphere of knowing I would  constantly badger you. In the realm of motion pictures TSAM begs to be  laughed with.
Technology, the infinite wonder that it is, has provided  english speaking humanity a wonderful oppurtunity to not only watch the  movie in its original theatrical aspect ratio. But to lay over the standard  picture an audio track that only the Farrelly brothers occupy. Sadly and  solemnly I cannot give my recommendation to this anticapated track.  Brothers Farrelly continually remark about the aboundance of friends and  family members included in the cast. Admirable yes, but to be  indiscriminate regarding who you know that gets into the movie and then  relate this extra-ordinary ability to the viewer surely could not have been  solicited by the producer or an anxious viewer. Rather, the public would  have appreciated comments toward the nuances and idiosyncracies of the  film.
In closing I regard this wondefully charming film in high esteem  and for that it receives five out of five stars. Though the non-inclusion  of extras was deeply disappointing.",963878400,,1871,4.964516129032258
1000342,3,6305248869,"Comparing this movie to a Zucker-Abraham-Zucker film is a lot like comparing a strip mall to Paris. Face it: There's Something About Mary is not Airplane! nor Hot Shots! nor any of those other well-remembered  classics.
What we don't see here is the tradition of the running joke.  Z-A-Z films are famous for their repeated gags, some of them owing their  existence to earlier films (such as the brilliant ""screwdriver""  scene in Airplane 2: The Sequel when Ted still has his ""drinking  problem"").
Standing on its own, the movie does have funny points  (some riotously funny) but they tie together badly. The screenplay seems to  have been written in order to jump from one joke to the next, but with no  thought given to fleshing out each joke to give it depth and character like  a running gag can develop. Many jokes are just funny because of their shock  value, an attribute which wears off quickly in any film. Great comedies  carry jokes on multiple levels, some of them mere statements of irony  spanning large parts of the film, yet Mary doesn't have that.
Yeah, the  movie was funny, but it just wasn't as funny as it was hyped up to be. The  movie benefits largely from the timing of its release, when it was largely  unchallenged as the ruling comedy of the year.",963878400,4,1274,4.625
1000343,2,6305248869,"Upon release in Summer, 1998, ""There's Something About Mary"" became the surprise comedy hit of the year, due to its string of consistently shocking gross-out gags. Because the film nearly overdoses on  scatology and innuendo, I didn't find much of the material funny (aside  from a gag involving Ben Stiller's roadside restroom stop). Nevertheless,  the rest of the audience laughed so hard, through the entire film, that it  often became difficult to hear the dialogue... and the picture did  incredible box office... so it's probably a matter of taste. My biggest  complaint about ""There's Something About Mary"" is that it fails  on the most rudimentary level: as an attempt to blend lighthearted,  touching romantic comedy with Kentucky Fried Movie--style raunch. Other  movies pull off this difficult feat successfully--particularly Mel Smith's  ""The Tall Guy"" and Paul Bartel's ""Eating Raoul"" <two  of the funniest films of the last twenty years>, and the Farrellys  should be lauded for trying to achieve that melange. But like oil and  water, the two comedic modes never quite gel, and sit beside each other  awkwardly.
The other Amazon reviewers are right: chances are, you'll  either love this film or hate it. But regardless of your reaction, try  *not* to see it alone! The humor here is deliberately uncomfortable, making  ""Mary"" far, far more enjoyable with a large group -- where the  embarrassment can be shared with other viewers.",963705600,5,1446,5.186147186147186

Ben Stiller was perfect as the dufus who somehow  finds himself with the most desirable girl in school.  Matt Dillon, much to  my surprise, was great as the competitor to win Mary's heart.  However,  Chris Elliot, who I love from Get a Life, had some really bad acting in  this film.  All in all, it is a great film that one could watch over and  over and still get a belly laugh.

I got the point after the thousandth time the  father, the mother, the cop, and the firefighter showed their bewilderment  at how Stiller got the zipper all the way up.(Don't show [it] please)  I was bewildered at how the ""release the tension"" scene was  filmed. I didn't think it was funny to see Stiller's facial expressions  while he was making ""fire-by-friction"" in the bathroom.(Less is  More Sometimes! ) The ""hair gel"" on the ear was just filthy.(Aye  Carumbe! ) The ending was anti-climactic to say the least as it ends like  everyone should expect as Stiller got the girl. There was nothing  interesting about how he got Mary.(At the end anyway) A decision is not  enough to get a laugh out of me. Sometimes more is  better! (Imagination)The whole scene when Stiller got arrested did not  get a chuckle out of me.(Homosexual jokes are examples of lowest common  denominator comedy. They are hackneyed and lack imagination.) The  shenannigans of the three men(actually four) were indeed hillarious and the  potential was certainly there for an explosion of hillarity in a romantic  setting but despite a great performance from Matt Dillon as the  pathetically sleazy private eye(with shiny white teeth) and the great  performance by the guy who played the pizza delivery boy/architect this  movie still didn't deliver. Decent performances from Ben Stiller and  Cameron Diaz didn't score a touchdown with me either.(Chris Elliot couldn't  save it) ""There's Something About Mary"" is somewhat of a dud.

All in all, one of the smartest dumb comedies you'll ever see, and check out the Jerry Springer-like ending!  END",956448000,3,888,4.714285714285714
1000422,4,6305248869,"One of the funniest comedies of the 90's. Cameron Diaz is great as Mary, the subject of many men's dream. Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are also great. But the real star of the movie are the Farrelly brothers who bring  their own unique style of comedy into the 'High-school crush' story. It  also has some really tender and knowing romantic scenes. The 'Puffy' and  'Hair Gel' scenes are bound to become classic. While the humor is crude;  not recommended for those under 10 or those easily insulted, it is  undeniably funny and ultimately kind-hearted. Entertaining and Hilarious.

Directed and written by the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber & Kingpin) but don't hold that against the movie - it is far funnier and far better crafted than either of those movies. Mary (Cameron Diaz) is a sexy, intelligent & a consistent character in this ""romantic comedy"".  I'm not going to give away any of the sight gags like other reviewers but I will say they are not the whole movie... by a long shot.

Yes, there were some  laughs here and there, but the filmmakers' insistance that crude and  tasteless is funny only goes to show how much wit and inspiration is  missing from most comedies nowadays.

Let's face it.  Every single one of Mary's suitors is a  stalker.  At a time where sound bites are confused with political  leadership and ""Titanic"" confused with entertainment, this film  could have made a powerful point on the confusion between love and  obsession without sacrificing its hilarious, tasteless humor.
