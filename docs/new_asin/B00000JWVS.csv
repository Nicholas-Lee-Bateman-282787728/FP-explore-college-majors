1238883,5,B00000JWVS,"""I'm Telling you for the Last Time"" is definitely hilarious.  If you want something that will make you laugh constantly, buy this video.  It is also available on CD.  It is just as funny on CD.  In any way shape or  form, Jerry Seinfeld rules.  On TV or not, Jerry Seinfeld is the man. I  definitely recommend this video to anyone.  Even if you do not like  Seinfeld, I don't think that is possible, buy this video.

But watching this standup, all this being done after he had retired, after he had left the hit show, after he had ended his $1 million-per-episode filming, he just wasn't there.  Watching this, you actually FELT like he was done with it all, that to actually do one more standup routine was nothing but work, no matter how sold out the crowd and no matter how much he was getting paid.  It was no longer fun, it was work.  The humor is good, the routine witty and you will laugh if you haven't heard any of this before.  But if you heard any of this on the show or on the radio, then skip this video.  It actually brings the humor DOWN a notch because it's evident his head and heart just aren't there.  If you pay $5 to watch this, then okay, you're happy because you did NOT pay the $85 to BE there and be disappointed, disappointed because you were there and Seinfield really wasn't.",1426377600,,1011,4.374331550802139

1238936,5,B00000JWVS,"LIVE: FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWS

I wasn't a particular fan of Jerry Seinfeld before I watched this standup DVD. I also wasn't aware of its status as a final and finely-tuned performance of classic material. As far as I was concerned, I purchased on a whim and had little idea if it would be any good at all...

Well, that's where the negative statements end. 'Live on Broadway' is simply brilliant. I laughed SO much. Seinfeld's material may be 'old' but his delivery, timing and sensitivity to keeping it fresh is a marvel. Not one f-word in the entire show, either. Now, as someone who is generally tolerant of such things, I was deeply impressed by that. And also as a writer, it actually reinforced my belief that you don't need to rely on strong language to get a laugh. Yes, it'll generate a cheap laugh, now and again - as evidenced by many of today's top performers who still go at it like there's no tomorrow. But the question remains, would their jokes be any less funny without? Hmm, maybe best not to speculate on that. Whatever the case, Jerry Seinfeld must rank as one of the great contemporary standup comedians of recent years, even for just daring to be different.

As with all observational comedy it's often the most mundane, mind-numbing subjects that can ellicit the strongest reactions - airports, hotels and taxis spring readily to mind, the sorts of places where feelings of deep depression are only a moodswing away - but Seinfeld grabs them all and does a makeover so sharp, so precisely funny, it's like someone popping a balloon in your face. A tour-de-force of genuine wit - the best kind, and that's because his material's so good.

Don't confuse a lack of courseness to mean that this is just a kids show, however. Far from it. There's some good old adult material woven in here and there, but it's so finely judged that it comes across as neither demeaning nor gratuitous, just plain entertaining. Again, it's a skill that's largely absent from even the most respected routines. Proof that if you try hard enough, orgasms don't necessarily have to make you cringe.

'Live on Broadway: I'm Telling You for the Last Time'...a wonderful lesson in observation and a treat for anyone who likes standup comedy at its finest. Thanks, Jerry.

VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1340668800,,2293,4.734335839598997
1238937,5,B00000JWVS,"Other than the snippets from his long-running TV show, I'd never seen Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy, which means that I'd never seen his act for more than 30- or 45-second sound bites.  But having enjoyed the shows and those snippets, I was excited to see this collection of old jokes when it was released years ago, as he was supposedly retiring all of his old material.  And this became an instant favorite in our house.

The opening sequence, a fake funeral where his old jokes are buried in a casket surrounded by a bunch of famous comedians, was cheesy and unnecessary.  But once Seinfeld got on stage, he's laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish.  One sure sign of good comedy is its ability to elicit laughter even when the audience knows the punch lines before they are spoken.  Having watched this show many times, I remember most of the jokes in advance.  Yet, I laugh constantly.  His writing is brilliant.  His delivery is perfect.  It never stoops to low-brow, sophomoric junk.  It's classic stuff.

Whenever we are inspired to rewatch this disc, it never disappoints.  I'm not exactly a connoisseur of stand-up comedy, but this is possibly the best stand-up show I've ever seen, and I'm happy to recommend it to anyone.",1331683200,,1239,4.787735849056604

1238939,5,B00000JWVS,"Wow, I loved this CD, it is absolutely  hilarious. Nobody does it better, Jerry Seinfeld stands alone on the world stage of comedy. This CD reminds us of all the wonderful days of the ""Seinfeld"" show and all his crazy, through the microscope of life little things that only he can see larger than life. The airport bit is genius.
What make's Jerry and this CD so special is his knack for seeing the things we all see every day but were too busy to notice just how funny life really is. Jerry is as funny or funnier than ever on this CD.
Lighten up, do yourself a favor, give yourself a gift of laughter. Buy this CD and laugh, then give it to someone else so they can laugh also.

its pretty much what you see on the show ''seinfeld'' from 1989-1998 and it is worth buying it if your a real fan of Jerry and you can tell by watching and listening the audience is having a wonderful time being there. this show was filmed in august of 1998 and on broadway in NYC right after the end of his TV show.
i have not met one person that has not liked or liked the hit TV show and the work jerry does on stage. he is one of the best comedians that is out there and you won't find another one like Jerry for a long time. i bought the DVD and the CD version of the show and i find both to be great you get the energy and the emotion in both formats but you go to a comedy show to really see the Performer and thats why the DVD is Good you get to see the crowd and Jerry at his best doing his best bits. a must if you are Fan as i am of Seinfeld.",1300579200,,1026,3.7767441860465114

The opening skit was boring and unnecessary but Jerry delivered fun and relatable content that still makes you laugh so hard you can't see straight.  The only reason I held back a star was his repeated use of ***damned which is personally offensive to us (I'd rather hear the ""f"" word, seriously) and that made it not-so family friendly with kids in the car.

The only minus i can think of is you can watch it once and then remember most of the jokes, which makes the next time you watch it not quite as funny. It's also missing the classic writing of Larry David and 3 other actors to make it as hilarious as the usual 'Seinfeld'.

1238955,4,B00000JWVS,"Jerry Seinfeld in his DVD ""I'm Telling You for the Last Time"" (1998) delivers as a consummate comedian. Seinfeld has the unique ability to see complexity and detail in supposedly simplistic everyday life and things. These include aspects like airflight traveling, cab drivers, airport bathrooms, doctors and waiting rooms, grocery stores, elderly folks in Florida, McDonalds, horses, and so much more. What is seemingly irrelevant and unnoticeable, is what Seinfeld can turn into jokes, and simultaneously keep the audience laughing and pondering, and talking about it the next day. Because much of what he portrays is based on common daily circumstances, Seinfeld's comedy is largely timeless. He certainly comes across as a meticulous master observer, one who gathers up unnoticeable and ignored detail in everyday life, and transmits this through comedy. Here are bits of Seinfeld humor. ""Airline peanut bags are too small, dig?...so are airline booze bottles and bathrooms."" ""When people go to the store they can never remember if they have enough milk."" ""New York cabbies are bad smelling foreigners and airport security guards are too fat.""

Notably, Seinfeld loves the short Question-Answer technique. He asks the audience, why this and this happens, and while they laugh at the seemingly simple yet intriguing question, he offers an answer that people would not expect, sending the audience into a frenzy of uncontrollable laughter. Example: ""Dogs are broke all their lives. You know why they have no money? No pockets. They see change on the street--there's nothing they can do about it."" Not to mention, most of Seinfeld's jokes are fresh. Furthermore, profanity does not exist in his routine, something he is so much credited for, given the significant employment of profanity by many comedians. Look at more of Seinfeld's comedy: ""I'm going to tell you the secret of the male mind---all men think of themselves as low-level superheroes.""

Jerry Seinfeld is remarkably comfortable on stage. He starts his joke routine casually then digs in with mostly fresh material. His appeal also has to do with his humility, calmness and ease, as well as genuine appreciation for his audience, all this despite the high level of success with his television show. Seinfeld even allows for audience questions, an aspect quite rare among comedians. Seinfeld is genuinely touched when the audience gives him a standing ovation whether at the beginning of or at the end of his set. Both on TV and stage, Seinfeld is a highly skillful comedian. The combination of his TV show (that ran for an impressive 9 years) and the stage performances build him into a much greater performer. The TV show offers more flexibility and body expression, whereas Seinfeld demonstrates far less facial expressions in the stage acts. Nevertheless, Seinfeld dramatizes that comedy can come across plainly but excellently without the employment of grotesque facial expressions that many comedians are known for.

While using some of the most mundane things in life for his material, he still possesses and transmits an intellectual form of humor. The Seinfeld performing on the DVD is quite  the same as the television Seinfeld. Many of the jokes are familiar, and even those that are not tend to sound like they are. That Seinfeld is also consistent in the humor from start to finish is undeniable. Further, Seinfeld tends to appeal to quite a wide audience, that transcends gender and even age to some extent, just as long as this audience is in tune with his intellectual oriented humor. Some of his jokes do have a mature backdrop, but overall Seinfeld's comedy can be enjoyed by both young and old. A good example that gathers a wide breadth of laughs is the segment about trick-or-treating as a child and drive toward a constant need for candy.

This movie; Jerry Seinfeld Live on Broadway: I'm Telling You for the Last Time, reminds us that the show was based on material that Jerry came up with.  I have had the pleasure of seeing Jerry twice in Sacramento, California.  He is brilliant with the most impeccable timing I have witnessed.

I'd never seen the DVD before, but some of the material sounded familiar... Perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the Seinfeld show?

You may notice that in his speel about the Chinese he lets the word ""shovel"" out too soon (when talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and thus spoils the joke a little bit.  But Seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib, so he managed to work around it.

It's not an impassioned performance by any means, but that is just not Jerry's style. He has a dryish sense of humour and is seldom animated. One thing for sure though is that Jerry is wickedly funny. His sarcastic style is somewhat innocent but excrutiatingly funny. It is almost socratic the manner in which Jerry pleads ignorance before poking fun at most human behaviours that we take no notice of. My favourite jokes are the ones on supermarkets and expiry dates on milk. The one about seedless watermelon is a classic. How about the knife that can cut through a shoe?!!!

Jerry's delivery is always smooth and perfectly timed. His facial expression (and lack thereof sometimes) adds to the depth of the joke. The material speaks for itself. He handles his material very well. His transitions are smooth and not forced. He speaks clearly and is easy to understand. There is no x-rated material and no profanity. It is easy for all and sundry to relate to the jokes, thus Jerry has cross-over appeal. This is the perfect entree into standup for the uninitiated.",1159660800,,1223,4.662037037037037

1238972,5,B00000JWVS,"I am admittedly a big fan of the ""Seinfeld"" television show, but had never seen Jerry do standup except in small excerpts on talk shows. This is a brilliant look into why Seinfeld became so phenomenally popular in the first place: he is the true master of wry observations about everyday life. Seinfeld more than any other comedian has the knack to observe real-world events that are common knowledge to virtually everyone (cab rides, airport security, pharmacists, etc.) and find the darkly funny side of the scenario that we can all relate to. I am an airline employee, and his observations about the sad state of our industry are right on the mark; that's the beauty of Jerry's comedy, though: everyone can laugh, even at themselves.

This particular performance is utterly brilliant. Fans of the television show will note that several of his routines became major plot points in the series. Seinfeld delivers classic observations that are as funny the tenth time as they are the first.

The introduction is well done with well known comedians present at a funeral to bury Jerry's jokes (""I'm telling you for the last time!"") The cameos by people like Robert Klein, Ed McMahon, and Jay Leno are great, but watching Garry Shandling try to steal Jerry's cast-off jokes is a true delight.

I thought he was more enthusiastic about being there recently in 2005.  He just seemed happier to be on stage than he did in 1998.  None the less this dvd from back in 1998 was very funny.  He still talked about very funny things and it still made me laugh a lot.

The material on the dvd was very funny one of my favorite chapters related to Mcdonalds...it was a short chapter but very funny.  anouther favorite involved doctors and stuff related to that.

The intro to the dvd was very cheezy but at the same time pretty funny.

I still rated this 5 stars because it made me laugh a lot even though it seemed as if he was going through the motions and was a little burned out in 1998 right after the show and all.

The Q and A section of the dvd is also very funny even though it is only under 5 minutes.  it showed that he could have a great comback for almost anything.

All and all i would reccomend this dvd to anyone that was a fan of the show or just a fan of jerry.  I would not let this substitue seeing him live because when i saw him a month ago it was all new material and he just seemed more enthusiastic about everything because he does not do it as much anymore.

I play it in my car on my way to work if I am in the mood for some laughs, and it never fails to deliver.  Great CD that you can listen to over and over.  I had the DVD for a while too, but there is only so many times you can watch the routine.

Jerry would have to get the silver medal in this category, the proverbial number 2.

He talks about childhood memories, parenting, relationships, and many tiny pieces of observation about our daily lives. One of the bits about airports, and flying had me laughing so hard I thought I would hurt myself.

""I'm Telling You for the Last Time"" is an outstanding comedic performance from the one and only, Jerry Seinfeld.
This is the last time that Seinfeld performs his most-known material.  He talks about air travel, cab drivers, candy, doctors and waiting rooms, McDonald's, airport/airplane bathrooms, and so much more.  This is the golden material that made Seinfeld's career, and he appropriately performs them for the last time.
As I said in the beginning of the review, there's literally nobody in the business that could ever duplicate Jerry's material and get the same response from it.  The material was made for Seinfeld, and that's why it works so well.  He's able to point out some of the most irrelevant or unnoticeable things in society and bring them into the spotlight.  Subtlety plays a major role in Jerry's performances.
The DVD also includes a bio on Jerry Seinfeld and a ""Q&A"" segment that was never aired.  The picture quality looks exceptionally good and the DVD does it justice.  Running time of the live performance is around 75 minutes.
""I'm Telling You for the Last Time"" is an amazing performance by an amazing comic.  Although it is sad to see him retire the material that made his career, it's nice to see that he is moving on and working on new bits.

The DVD itself is really great. You get a very nicely-shot show and on top of this you get a q&a with Jerry that happened post-show.

He uses some of the most mundane things in life for his material, yet I somehow consider him to possess an intellectual sort of humor.  The Seinfeld you get in this performance is basically the same Seinfeld Americans laughed with on television for nine years.  A lot of the jokes are familiar, and even those that aren't tend to sound as if they are.  I don't think every joke was delivered perfectly in this show, but the consistency of the humor from start to finish is undeniable.  The opening is a pretty good one, featuring Seinfeld burying all of his old comedy material in a coffin while some of comedy's big names mourn their loss.  Onstage, he jokes about a myriad of topics including airport security, New York cab drivers, old folks in Florida, grocery stores, doctors and medicine, horses, etc.  Naturally, there is some material on men and women and the differences between them.  While there are a couple of jokes with a somewhat mature theme, by and large Seinfeld's comedy can be enjoyed by young and old alike.  The segment about trick-or-treating as a kid and being driven by a constant need for candy would be my pick of the litter in terms of inherent laughs.
It really doesn't matter that much if you've already heard these jokes along the way-who hasn't heard the infomercial/Ginsu knife bit before?  Seinfeld's delivery makes you want to laugh no matter what.  I was a little surprised at the end, though.  I was expecting a big joke to end the night with, and then out of the blue Seinfeld thanked the audience and wandered offstage.  Naturally, he does make an encore appearance, this type agreeing to answer questions hurled at him from the audience.  I enjoyed this segment to some degree, but it wasn't as funny as a few more minutes of scripted comedy would have been.  It also seemed rather choppy because it necessarily had to have some filler and dead spots edited out for continuity.
This one is really pretty simple: if you were a fan of Seinfeld's television show and delight in his quirky kind of humor, you will certainly enjoy this tape and will no doubt want to watch it on more than one occasion.",1042502400,42,2242,4.654822335025381

1239007,5,B00000JWVS,"Seinfeld live on Broadway is a ""no regrets"" DVD. Its a great looking performance that puts you in the best seat of the audience. Jerry dishes out over an hour of his best material delivered ""for the last time"" and it is hilarious even after repeat viewings. You can read some of the jokes on the back of the DVD, but it's Seinfeld's delivery that brings them to life and keeps the jokes fresh and funny. One of the great additions on this DVD that isn't on the tape is an impromptu audience Q & A with Jerry. The audience fires off a variety of what I thought were some pretty dull questions. ""How's your new apartment?"" ""Say, Hello Newman."" Jerry answers every one with responses that are as funny as the show material. The disc is not rated but it is funny and great for the whole family. My mom at 60 and my niece who is just eight love watching the VHS of this show again and again. The DVD is even better.",999734400,40,910,4.2057142857142855
1239011,5,B00000JWVS,"We keep this tape going in the waiting room.
It's G rated, and you can watch it for short periods of time because it has about 100 short ""bits"" (unlike a Seinfeld sitcom show.)
Most, if not all, patients have never seen it or even know it exists. and its very very funny! We always get lots of positive feedback from anxious patients waiting to be seen.  It makes their wait amusingly tolerable

1239012,4,B00000JWVS,"You've heard most of it before (which is, I suppose, why he's retiring the material).  It's definately the best of Seinfeld in standup mode, though I don't think Seinfeld rates as one of the best standups (he shines in other formats though!).
Many a chuckle, though you won't be laughing till it hurts.",991094400,,302,4.69811320754717
1239013,5,B00000JWVS,"I must say that this Seinfeld stand-up act is Jerry at his best.  It doesn't get much funnier than his bit about airports, though I love the entire set.  I never get tired of laughing at this DVD.  If you love the TV show Seinfeld and its commentary on the minutia of everyday life, you will LOVE this DVD.",990403200,,306,4.1525423728813555
1239014,5,B00000JWVS,"There is some really funny material on this DVD. I've always enjoyed his television show, so I wasn't too surprised to enjoy this program. But what surprises me is that it's just as funny every time I watch it. Except for some very mild profanity, it's pretty clean material. If it was rated like a movie, I'm sure the most it would get is PG-13, maybe even PG. The DVD is great for skipping to the different bits.",969580800,3,414,4.32051282051282
1239015,5,B00000JWVS,I have to admit I am an avid Seinfeld fan.  I saw him in person perform this routine when he was touring before he retired all his material.  It was excellent too!  The DVD of the broadway show brought back memories of  me sitting in my seat laughing at the same jokes.  The picture and color  are amazing.  I will be able to watch this DVD over and over again for the  rest of my life and love it every time.  This is a MUST HAVE even if you  aren't a big Seinfeld fan.,954633600,6,470,3.904255319148936
1239016,2,B00000JWVS,"I thought the Seinfeld show was the best written sitcom next to The Simpsons, but this stand up act is drowning in banality.  Al Franken jokingly likes to say, ""Comedians are truth tellers.""  Seinfeld  gives us the 'truth' in all its mind numbing detail.  ""Airline peanut  bags are too small, dig?""  And now the extended riff, ""so are  airline booze bottles and bathrooms.""  It's so funny 'cause it's true!  ""When people go to the store they can never remember if they have  enough milk.""  He's holding up a mirror, man!  ""New York cabbies  are bad smelling foreigners and airport security guards are too fat.""  Stick it to the man, Jerry!  Small targets, small truths, and no  jeopordized endorsement deals either.  Two Stars for being a trailblazer  and the best of what has become a very tired genre.",953769600,9,803,4.737226277372263
1239017,4,B00000JWVS,"Jerry Seinfeld's TV show never really became a hit over here in England, and I have no idea why, because it is the best sitcom ever produced. Full stop. The genius of the inter-linked, completely inconsequential plots were  hilarious, and I would have thought that the selfish and egotistical  characters would have caught on over here because we like our sitcoms dark  and twisted. Instead, rubbish like Friends gets the top slots in the  ratings. That's the BBC scheduling for you.  This DVD is a fine testament  to Seinfeld, and even though I had the CD I had to get the DVD because it's  about one of the only Seinfeld shows on retail (where's the series?). You  can skip to your favourite parts, and also hear a couple of things that  aren't on the CD - and the Q and A session is much better in  pictures...actually, come to think of it, the whole thing is. Of course,  the picture clarity is crystal clear, but that's not so important here,  because you'll either love this DVD or you'll hate it because of the  presence of Jerry - and I loved it. The sound's very good as it makes you  think that you're really there, so turn it up loud and pretend you're in  the auditorium, because this'll have you laughing for ages. Just goes to  show that more stand-up acts should be released onto DVD.",945216000,27,1299,4.463829787234043
1239018,4,B00000JWVS,"Jerry Seinfeld is telling us for the last time.  We don't want it to be the last time. We want his material non-stop. He's exorbitantly funny and indubitably merited for spectators' standing ovation, as in the show. Witty Seinfeld will be back any time.",943228800,2,253,4.75
