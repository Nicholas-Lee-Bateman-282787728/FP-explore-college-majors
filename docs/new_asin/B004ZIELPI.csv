8449805,1,B004ZIELPI,"Do you have Netflix streaming? Do you like awfull movies like troll 2, eyeborgs, transmorphers, the black knight returns? Me neither. This movie will either make you very upset or have you on the ground laughing.
  On days I feel like staying up or can't sleep ill bust out my vita, pop in my head phones and watch the endless stream of awfull movies on Netflix streaming. Battle New York day 2 is just one of them. This movie stood out because of the name. As if we'd really believe that this is a sequel to battle Los Angeles. You'd have to be pretty dense or ignorant to think that this movie is on the same level as battle la. Now I love bad movies. You never know when you'll find a gem like Satans little Helper, troll 2, evil dead, or Twilight. But battle New York is just unwatchable.
  It starts out with these two ladies, one of which is a doctor the other a mental patient soon to be released because she was hearing sounds and voices. They're both looking over the bay at the Statue of Liberty. What are saying? I have no clue because of the background noise. I guess you're suppose to be hearing what she's hearing but it's just awful white noise that drives you crazy. Then a flash of light appears and everyone disappears and not in a cool dramatic way.  I mean they show shots of a kinda busy back New York street to a still of the same street except they were lucky enough to keep people out of the picture.  Pure genius. Any way the girl that was the mental patient wakes up in the secluded area of New York and can't find a soul. She continues to walk around looking for people.  showing close ups of her feet walking and close ups of her eyes while the audio plays an overwhelming sound of wind, looping the same sound over and over. this literally goes on for almost 5 minutes and you will want to kill yourself.
  Finally this stupid gyro robot comes out and chases her. They show another close of her eyes and her feet running. I guess they had to do this to avoid filming in a busy New York back street. The camera shakes like its trying to be a JJ Abrahms film but fails to capture anything that can be considered a rational shot. So this horrible cgi robot is chasing her down a side walk.  So How does she escape? Does she fall in the sewer? Does she end up killing the machine. Does someone else kill it? Does an army chopper pick her up. Nope. A bum comes around the corner and they turn right down the next street. Yup. Apparently gyros can't turn to the right. It must've made 4 lefts and by the time it did they were gone.
  Anyway this bum takes her to his hideout and he's all weird and crazy. They talk about some crap that....I don't know.  at this point I was ready to blowy brains out. They leave hide out for whatever reason and find some people standing in the street just starring at her. Then they attack her, making horrible zombie noises and acting even worse at it. These were absolutely the worst excuses for zombies I've ever seen literally, and I've seen more b zombie movies than I can count. It offended me to the point of laughing how bad these zombies were. The looks and sounds they made was pure slapstick.  You'd think that how popular zombies are now a days, even the extras would understand how to play a better zombie. These actors had their eyes rolled back and hands out with their fingers curled.
  At this point it was either turn the movie off  or make my wife a widow. I realize there's bad movies out there. I also realize those bad movies are made by film students or upcoming directors that get their hands on a small budget. But battle New York day 2 is just bad, it's bad bad. It fails at every corner to do anything right. My tv tech 2 film from high school was better. It's called "" team alpha care"" it's on YouTube. I play Sucking Justice.  Watch it or be destroyed.",1372723200,2,3838,4.255845942228335
8449806,5,B004ZIELPI,I had Battle for Los Angeles so of course I had to get this I like the action in this type of movie,1362009600,,99,3.347826086956522
8449807,1,B004ZIELPI,"The title suggests a low-budget knockoff of Battle: Los Angeles.  Sadly, it's not even that. Instead it's a poorly made zombie flick with some alien robots thrown in and a terrible conspiracy plot. At one point, when the alien plan is explained, a character exclaims that its ""f***king retarded!"" He could have been talking about the script.",1335744000,3,341,4.982456140350878
8449808,2,B004ZIELPI,"According to IMDb this movie had a $150,000 budget. Did someone embezzle $149,000 before production started? The sound at times makes the dialogue incomprehensible which probably is a blessing in disguise. The effects are the furthest away from being special as effects can get. Whenever one is subjected to a zombie attract there are never more than 10 zombies, a very surprising number for the millions which should have been created in a city the size of New York. SPOILER - maybe the zombie count is correct as the zombies are only created from sane people. It does have a few good moments - make that seconds. Battle of New York - Day Two is not the worse movie I have seen but it should have ended on Day One and I pray there is no Day Three.",1335571200,,748,4.427536231884058
