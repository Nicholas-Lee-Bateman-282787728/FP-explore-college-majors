8532420,1,B008YAPRIS,"Because this is beyond unofficial. I would have thought it was ok, but you can tell someone used iMovie to make this. Plus they spelled Nicki Minaj wrong that scrolls by on the screen in the background. They spelled Nikki instead of Nicki. Plus you can find better quality videos of the same footage on youtube.",1384214400,4,311,4.571428571428571
8532421,1,B008YAPRIS,"i absolutely love nicki minaj so when i saw this dvd listed on amazon i had to have it. there weren't any reviews which is usually a huge NO but from the description of the video it seemed like it would be footage from her earlier rapping days when she wasn't as known. from the minute the dvd starts and it has her name misspelled across the screen its obvious that its not going to be good. the quality is terrible and it looks like a bunch of clips from videos off of youtube mashed together and called a ""production"", all of the facts are information that is already known by any fan of nicki's, the picture would go black a couple of times and then come back, it looks like someone took a powerpoint presentation and somehow made it into a movie, whoever is speaking is absolutely boring, and it doesn't even have nicki speaking exclusively or show any music videos. the point is this dvd is crap, if it were possible to give a dvd review 0 stars i definitely would. don't bother to waste your money, if you want to watch nicki or learn more about her you're better off watching her videos on youtube and going on wikipedia than buying this dvd. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",1379721600,2,1173,4.336363636363636
