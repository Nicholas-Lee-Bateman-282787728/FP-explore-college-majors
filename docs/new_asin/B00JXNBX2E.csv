6397122,2,B00JXNBX2E,"The film was stunning. I mean I felt stunned at the end of the film. I had this ""what did I just watch"" feeling and didn't know if I should have enjoyed it more, after all it was Asylum.

It seems the city-state of Enos has wealth but is falling apart. Arius (Christian Oliver) has just been made captain of the army and is also engaged to Princess Theodora (Christina Ulfsparre). General Nikos (Dylan Vox)  decides to lead an army against Enos and capture it. Routed, Arius and his companions flee to the city of Sagev in hopes of finding Hercules to aid them...providing he is not just a legend. They aren't sure. Their search for Hercules (John Hennigan) turns up a crude drunkard who burps, pukes, drinks, and urinates constantly throughout the film. Seems Hercules has issues this demi-god has trouble handling.

There was no ""what was that lion thing"" in this film as there was in the blockbuster, but it wouldn't have hurt. The characters in the film had various English accents from various periods. One character Tymek had his named pronounced ""Timex"" and another time ""Panic."" I kept wondering who these people were. Some of the fighting at the end was comical, people moving around not knowing what to do. There was a funny scene when our gang enters a bar asking for Hercules. The movie was filmed in Morocco which made ancient Greece look a desert.

Not recommended for serious viewers, and I am not too sure about Asylum viewers.

6397123,4,B00JXNBX2E,"Hercules Reborn was a fun movie. No it does not have the big budget of the new Rock movie or the visual effects flair of The Legend of Hercules 3d, but I was able to enjoy it just the same. It's one of those movies where you can just sit back with your favorite beverage and relax for an hour.

I really enjoyed John Morrison's acting as Hercules. He even throws in some WWE like bodyslams in addition to the swordplay. Hopefully we see John Morrison in some future movies. The story is pretty generic, but as I said above it is the type of movie that  story does not matter as much as the action. Morrison did provide a lot of psyche and I really did enjoy him as Hercules.

The action also was a surprise. This movie has some pretty cool gore effects for a low budget flick. The fights are also pretty interesting, especially when the movie takes a unique turn near the end. I won't spoil it here.

Please check this out if you want to enjoy an entertaining flick with a wrestling superstar. This will definitely hold over Hercules fans until the new Rock movie is released.",1405036800,3,1076,4.311881188118812
6397124,3,B00JXNBX2E,"Far Surpassed expectations of the 4.2 IMDb rating!! ""Hercules Reborn"" is a swords and sandals action epic with twists & turns! The picture quality boasts extraordinary: clarity, details, and HD. John Hennigan had a dynamic screen presence and was believable as Hercules (unlike Kellan Lutz). Hennigan did great work with the Action sequences (his Pro Wrestling experience paid off vastly). Dylan Vox played a diabolical villain!!! Christina Wolfe was the damsel in distress, but she had some fight in her! Production found some truly Spectacular sets in Morocco. They made it work somehow (even on a shoestring budget!). I would rank this Hercules as being better than ""The Scorpion King"" sequels and the ""In The Name of the King"" sequels. Some people criticize and bash movies from Asylum, but ""Hercules Reborn"" was a fairly decent effort. ""Hercules Reborn"" was better than ""The Legend of Hercules"" (even though they both currently have a 4.2 IMDb rating). ""The Legend of Hercules"" had a 70 Million budget. ""Hercules Reborn"" is a remarkable achievement for Asylum considering its small micro budget. John Hennigan is a star on the rise!!",1437177600,3,1138,5.1567567567567565
6397125,1,B00JXNBX2E,The actor was terrible.  It is a disgrace to other Hercules movies.,1432252800,,67,4.583333333333333
6397126,3,B00JXNBX2E,"This movie surprised me. It actually showed Hercules dark side. He did go nuts and kill his family, he was a nasty drunk too. Most people don't know the myth at all. Its a far more realistic portrayal than anything sorbo or reeves ever did.",1428537600,,240,4.355555555555555

6397128,1,B00JXNBX2E,"if you were expecting a Hercules movie...this isn't it. The character of Hercules is barely a blip in the so-called movie. he's a drunk and he is better stronger than a regular guy. Let me talk about the acting....What acting? Horrifyingly bad acting by all concerned, even James Duval, who I have a ton of respect for. (why was he trying some bad English accent?)  Can I talk about the Princess of the piece....I don't want to....wow is she bad. The whole thing probably cost a couple hundred dollars. You may ask, if it wasn't about Hercules, then who was it about...glad you asked. I believe that a really terrible actor named Dylan Vox also produced this train wreck and then I guess made himself the star????!!!! I've seen a doorknob give finer performances. I guess this is how he gets into a movie, if you check anything he has ever done.....he is awful. If I could give no stars that would be best....I wish I could go minus 2 stars. Christian Oliver does try, I will give him that.....but he has no shot. Such bad dialog.",1412985600,,1030,4.508021390374331

6397131,2,B00JXNBX2E,"Sometimes these small budget rip-off movies are as good as the big budget ones they copy, but this isn't the case here. In fact, the big budget version with the Rock, wasn't that great either. It seems though that they did try to do something different, where they tone down the myth of Hercules's power. Just like the Rock version, this version DOESN'T HAVE SUPER HUMAN STRENGTH. Hercules is powerful, maybe because he fighting really WEAK opponents. The soldiers they have in this movie really look like they need to work out! They don't have any muscles at all, I'm surprised they can hold up that spear and shield they have.

The acting and the visuals aren't too great. The actors didn't really make me believe in their characters and they seemed to say things too scripted. The visuals I could understand because it's a really low budget film, but I have to point it out. All the costumes, weapons, buildings, props are too cheap looking. If you see it in 720p, you really get a good look at how cheap everything is.

The fight scenes are the best part of this movie. Looks like they did have a good stunt coordinator for this movie. You will probably get the most for your money for the fights scenes.

I didn't really care for the story. It's pretty basic story. A general in a city overthrows the King and Queen and kills them. Then, takes control of the army and takes the princesses as his queen. Her lover then has to get help from Hercules to save the day.",1409356800,,1469,4.473880597014926
