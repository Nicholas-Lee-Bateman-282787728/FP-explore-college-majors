8209959,4,B000TKIAEE,"Sweet and funny in places, but depressingly real.  An honest look at what it's like to spend one's very long days in a retirement home, to not have control over most things in life, to be lonely and separated from busy families and unable to care for oneself, waiting for infrequent visits from the outside.  Left with only memories and having to adapt to what enjoyment can be had with 'new family' of peers and where most freedoms are granted only by permission--makes me glad we've chosen to keep mom with us.  Well done story, and uplifting at times, but overall a sad way to treat our wisdom-keepers.",1401235200,,605,4.583333333333333

8209961,5,B000TKIAEE,"Covered so many areas of concern older people have and presented funny, witty, creative insight to handling our fears plus the inspiration things don't all have to go downhill just because we lose our youth.  A bright side can be found to almost any situation.  Age actually provides some advantages - wisdom, a relaxed detachment, freedom from pressures to achieve, the realization we still have gifts to offer others.  This movie
was sheer enjoyable entertainment for me but after it was over I realized what a positive impact it had on my thinking.

In addition knowing Richard Bull was playing opposite his real wife of 51 years, Barbara Collentine made the film ever so special.  It is easy to see why this is his most treasured role of his long and productive acting career.  She sparkled in the role as only a woman truly in love can do.  Gerry Fortin",1246060800,2,858,4.68
8209962,5,B000TKIAEE,"I wish this movie had an attachment to tell what it was about. I took a chance and bought it, and I`m very glad I did. This movie was just beautiful and makes us remember that, no matter what age we get to be, we still are that same person we were when at a younger age.
My viewpoint will never be the same after watching this movie. Excellent characters and a more than exceptional role performed by Richard Bull!
I give this movie 5 stars!",1222214400,2,441,4.1395348837209305
