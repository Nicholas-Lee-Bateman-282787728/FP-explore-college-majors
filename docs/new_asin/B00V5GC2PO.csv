8709283,5,B00V5GC2PO,A movie that went truly under the radar during the 70's. Great soundtrack and a guest appearence by the powerful Bessie Griffin! The topic still represent today,1532649600,,160,4.962962962962963
8709284,5,B00V5GC2PO,"This one is pure 1970's grindhouse GOLD.  Beautiful, stark and atmospheric film that portrays black ghetto youth, not as gangsters and criminals, but as honorable young men, looking to do the right thing, when their local good-guy cop/friend is gunned down by a mystery shooter. Several scenes are so emotionally powerful that you might get a tear in your eye. Other scenes are just filled with so much beautiful 70's nostalgia and innocence that will bring a smile to the face of anyone who appreciates this kind  of cinema.  Sadly forgotten diamond of a film that used to play in inner city movie theaters on a double bill with the similarly themed ""Johnny Tough,"" which was an American remake of the film ""400 Blows."" ""Together Brothers"" remains one of the finest examples of Black cinema, as it is a rare case where there is no exploitation or silly comedy; just wonderful, powerful cinema.  Sadly these kinds of films are not produced anymore...Highly recommended.",1527897600,,969,4.92638036809816

8709288,3,B00V5GC2PO,"Only a MOD-DVD, but this Fox Cinema Archives release looks impressive for standard definition: a strong, scrupulously clean image -- certainly more solid than the shaky murder-mystery plot -- and unmistakably a product of grainy 70s film stock. Picture-wise, it's on a par with, say, the Criterion Collection DVD of 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle' (shot the previous year).

Also of note visually is the movie's climactic confrontation, staged in a desolate nocturnal-industrial setting. Every drop of sweat on the actors' tense faces is visible, framed by pools of background bokeh. It just might be the closest Blaxploitation ever gets to Michael Mann.",1435968000,2,651,5.320388349514563
