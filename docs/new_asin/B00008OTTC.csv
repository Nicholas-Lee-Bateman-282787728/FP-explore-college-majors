7986127,5,B00008OTTC,"The shock of Kotori's death and the fight with Fuma have left Kamui unconscious. As a last resort, Subaru has used his power to invade Kamui's mind and give him a reason to keep on living. Upon awakening, Kamui decides that he will fight to bring Fuma back to his senses. Even though Kamui has regained consciousness, Subaru is injured from his technique and will not be able to fight for a while.

This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",1355184000,,785,4.413793103448276
7986128,5,B00008OTTC,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,2,4144,4.466225165562914
7986129,5,B00008OTTC,"A wonderful series for anyone who wants a deep, emotional story. Sure its a series where the world as we know it is a stake but this story has an unique plot and feeling to it. Although they are fighting for the world, each character has a desire/wish they want fullfilled and each have their own ways of trying to reach that desire.

I think the most important parts of this DVD is Kayko joining Fuma, Subaru finally accepting his place with the Seven Seals, and finally, the battle that takes place on the last eposide of this volume. Kayko breifly stands up to Fuma before joining the Seven Angels on the condition that Fuma will grant his only wish. Subaru joins the Seals and they need his skills to save Kamui from himself! Another important person is killed by Fuma's hands, and Hinoto begins her downward spiral into the darkness of her mind.

This is one of the more emotional DVDs in the series. I recommend buying this series because watching it once is not enough!",1126569600,,976,4.508474576271187
7986130,5,B00008OTTC,"A great addition to the X series. On this volume, Subaru must help Kamui return to reality from his coma. The newly awakened Fuma breaks into a hotel and takes Kakyo Kuzuki, the dreemseer for the Dragons of Earth to Kanoe where he meets Yuto and Satsuki,meaning that now Four of the Dragons of Earth have gathered. Nataku is freed from his glass jar and steals the Shinken and heads for Fuma. Seishiro and Kusanagi follow him and then all seven of the Dragons of Earth have gathered. At the same time, the seven members of the Dragons of heaven gather and the battle is about to begin. Fuma and Nataku attack a building and Kamui and Daisuke try to stop the building from collapsing and killing innocent people. The ending of this volume is sad,just like to one before it, because someone dies at the hands of a Dragon of Earth. I am eagerly awaiting the release of X Volume 6. I have already ordered it from Amazon and when I get it, I will review it!",1058140800,,952,4.353932584269663
7986131,5,B00008OTTC,"These are the pivotal episodes of the series.  We have been introduced to all of the primary characters and the conflict has been sketched out.  When Kamui made his decision to become a Dragon of Heaven (one of those who preserve), destiny forces Fuma, Kamui's 'twin star,' to become a Dragon of Earth (one of those who destroy).  Now it is time for the sides to form up and the conflict to begin.
'Return' follows the aftermath of Kotori's death at the hands of Fuma, Kamui goes into a period of trancelike inaction.  So unable to cope with the tragedy that psychic intervention is required.  This creates one of the most beautiful and touching episodes of the series.  For one last time, the dragons can show their human sides.
'Gathering' continues the process of forming up the opposing sides.  Kamui locks up the divine Shinken to prevent its use before the appropriate time, freeing its mirror sword for Fuma's use in the continuing interplay of balanced moves that mark this complex drama.
'Guardian' marks the first serious confrontation between Kamui and Fuma since they have accepted their new rules.  Even the Dragons of Earth are not entirely comfortable with Fuma's new personality.  Yet he seems to hold the upper hand as long as Kamui's moral compunctions prevent him from acting without concern for the other characters.
Balance and destiny are the twin themes of 'X,' and these episodes crystallize this struggle as each change or victory causes an equivalent counter-reaction.  Hinoto, dreamseer of the Dragons of Heaven, struggles against her own visions of the future, unable to give up her will to fashion a new outcome to an age old conflict.  The creators of this series - Clamp, have chosen to paint the Dragons of Earth in darker tones than their opponents, but the viewer should keep in mind that this is really not the case, and that both sides face a disastrous future.
Highly recommended.  One of the best so far in an excellent series.",1056758400,2,1965,4.815476190476191
7986132,5,B00008OTTC,"X is a beautiful, well thought out anime. The imagery can be dark but it can also be very serene. This anime offers a very interesting view about the end of the world and the notions of preordained fate. It is like watching a true gothic masterpiece unfold over a 24-episode time span. X is a perfect balance of heart pounding intense action and very smart intellectual drama.
The previous 4 volumes are great. But so far, this one is my favorite. All the events in the previous 4 volumes lead to the events in this volume. This DVD is the turning point of the saga. Both Kamui and Fuma have made their choice of who to fight for. Now the real battle for the fate of the world and all of mankind can truly begin. If you like X, buy this DVD.",1055808000,6,741,4.188811188811189
7986133,4,B00008OTTC,"This DVD is just another DVD of a great series. The DVD X [One] blew me away and I immediately bought this DVD as well. This was almost a let-down. It's not a shot at the series, but to the people who are organizing these DVDs for American release. I am seriously sick and tired of 3-episode DVDs. We all know they can put at least 5 episodes on one DVD and when they put 3, they're trying to scam more money from me. For our [item price] we at least deserve 4 episodes!
Great series, but these DVD's aren't really worth the money unless you're really into it. I can't justify [that much] to an episode.",1054684800,2,603,4.162393162393163
