8400198,3,B003M8NGO4,"UFC 114 was one of the most hyped and anticipated UFC events in the sports history, what with a massive grudge match between two former UFC light heavyweight champions, Rampage Jackson and Rashad Evans who were originally due to fight for the title back at UFC 98 but a jaw injury for Rampage ruled him out, they were then put as opposing coaches on the reality TV program The Ultimate Fighter and were to fight at the conclusion of that season, however Rampage left the UFC to take a part in the A-Team movie, which meant again there would be no fight, Jackson would eventually rejoin the UFC and his first fight back would be against Rashad Evans with the winner guaranteed a title shot.

The fight had a big build up including a three part primetime series thats included on the dvd, which only served to inflame the bad blood that had been brewing between the two, so this was really a fight that everyone was looking forward to, disappointly the fight didn't deliver to all the hype, with both men coming out fairly unscathed, even though the trash talk has continued and there will no doubt be a rematch on the cards somewhere down the line.

The rest of the card is pretty mediocre too with Antnio Rogrio Nogueira(little nog) Vs. Jason Brilz been the stand out and even that's marred by a bad judging for English interest John Hathaway fights Diego Sanchez and Michael Bisping fights Dan Miller. The Full Preliminary card is included on the Dvd as is the always excellent countdown show as well as the post press conference whcih is always interesting, overall UFC 114 was not a bad event but with all the hype for the main event I was expecting a whole lot better.",1316044800,,1672,4.533112582781457
8400199,5,B003M8NGO4,"At UFC 96, Rashad Evans sat ringside with Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan as his teammate, Keith Jardine, took on Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. While it was a great fight, the final 10 seconds may have cost Jardine the unanimous decision that was awarded to Quinton. On top of all that, when Rogan was in the cage, Rampage would scream out, ""I WANT MY BELT BACK!!!!!!!!"" It was then, that the champ back then, who happened to be Rashad, ran into the octagon and got in Rampage's face. And it was just the beginning of the trash talking. At UFC 98, Rashad would get knocked out. After that, he was selected to be a coach for the reality show, THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER. And can you guess who the opposing coach might be? You guessed it! Another former Light Heavyweight Champion, but the man Rashad hates, Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. From there the confrontations got more and more heated, and both of these guys got pretty pissed! SO, after all of that, and AFTER Rampage made the decision to star in the movie, ""A-Team,"" at UFC 114, these two heated and hated rivals are finally going to go at it!! And this is the Main Event for UFC 114!

For the Co-Main Event, we get Michael Bisping, coming off of a loss to Wanderlei Silva at UFC 110. His opponent happens to be one of the Miller brothers from Jersey. There's Jim and Dan, and Dan is the one at Middleweight. Both brothers known for putting on great shows, and just leaving it all out there in the octagon! And in his last performance, Dan Miller fought Demian Maia, and came up short on the judges scorecards. Miller knows he doesn't have the big name, but he's going to win this fight. Bisping is looking for the finish any way he can get it.

Also you have Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, ""Lil Nog,"" taking on Jason ""The Hitman"" Brilz. Without a doubt, this is the toughest test Brilz has ever had in his MMA career! How's he going to measure up against one of the best there is?

This is loaded with great fights!! I loved it! There are 11 fights on this DVD, and I'll list them below.

Jesse Forbes vs. Ryan Jensen: On TUF 3, Forbes was immature and cocky. But he's put a string of wins together that let him come back to the big show. Despite his latest setback at UFC 108, Dana White's promise not to cut anybody from that card gives Ryan Jensen yet another opportunity. And one of them makes quick work of the other with a 1st round submission!

Aaron Riley vs. Joe Brammer: This one's rather simple. Due to a cut, Riley came up short against Ross Pearson at UFC 105. And Brammer was submitted rather quickly by Mark Bocek at the TUF Heavyweights Finale. One of them gets the W they need with a unanimous decision.

Luiz Cane vs. Cyrille Diabate: Both are known for their striking, but one is REALLY known for his striking. And that man gets a 1st round TKO!

Melvin Guillard vs. Waylon Lowe: Everybody knows that Melvin's KO power is no joke. Waylon Lowe came up short against Santino DeFranco, and never made it into the house to join the TUF Season 9 case, US vs. UK. But he still gets a shot at the big show. This 1st round TKO is crushing!

Efrain Escudero vs. Dan Lauzon: This fight just got on my last nerve. Because while it was good, it could've been finished. And instead it went to a unanimous decision!

Amir Sadollah vs. Dong Hyun Kim: Another TUF winner, taking on a man who's grappling has kept him undefeated in his career. I suspected the outcome of this one the whole time, and I was right. A very dominating unanimous decision.

Diego Sanchez vs. John Hathaway: After getting handled by Penn, Sanchez moves back to Welterweight. And he has to deal with undefeated Brit, John Hathaway. I couldn't believe the way this was dominated, and a unanimous decision was well earned!

Antonio Rogerio Nogueira vs. Jason Brilz. This was incredible! But if you ask me, the wrong man won the fight. And everybody else thought so too. Split decision, still a great fight that nobody will forget!

Todd Duffee vs. Mike Russow: Ok, both of these men made their debut at UFC 102. Both of these men won. Duffee had a record breaking KO in just 7 seconds over Tim Hague. Russow had the most boring fight of the night over Justin McCully. I'm telling you, wait until you see what happens! The KO that happens in the 3rd round is like out of a movie. WOW!!!

Michael Bisping vs. Dan Miller: They both came ready to fight, name or no name. And they fought well. Unanimous decision to the winner!

Quinton Rampage Jackson vs. Rashad Evans: Both men rocked the other man at least once. And they both put on a show. May not have been Fight of the Night, but the result was a unanimous decision!

What can I say? I enjoyed this card! Can't you tell? I hope you enjoy it as well.",1294444800,3,4715,4.403448275862069
