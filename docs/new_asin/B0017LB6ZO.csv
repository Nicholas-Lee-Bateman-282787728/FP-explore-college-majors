8266329,4,B0017LB6ZO,A very good documentary up to Vietnam at Cam Ranh Bay. I would like to know if there are any additional documentaries during or at the end of the conflict by either DOD or Department of the Army.,1406332800,,195,4.157894736842105
8266330,3,B0017LB6ZO,"When in Vietnam I flew helicopters, specifically CH-47A Chinooks which were quite large.  At one time I had to fly to the USNS Corpus Christi Bay for parts for our UH-1 Huey.  I made three trips to the ship and the landing pad was just large enough to fit the landing gear pattern on the Chinook landing cross ways.  The cockpit was hanging over the side and I was guided by the crew watching the wheels on deck.  It was very challenging.  The landing officer told me he had waved me off several times, but I never saw him, and so he was somewhat perturbed at this young pilot for not paying attention to him.  The second and third landing was completed without his showing up at all.  I enjoyed seeing this ship again and it looks like that landing pad grew since I landed on it 46 years ago.  :)",1380153600,,797,4.231788079470198
8266331,3,B0017LB6ZO,was very disappointed in the video . was expecting much more from it as I served on this ship for 15 months and it was used for the purpose of depot maintenance for all aircraft in Vietnam .wish it had shown much more involvement in inner workings of this fine support group.
