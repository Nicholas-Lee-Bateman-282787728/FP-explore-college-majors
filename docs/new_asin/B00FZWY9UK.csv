8619811,5,B00FZWY9UK,WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT JOHHNNY CARSON TONIGHT SHOW.  IT IS GREAT. HAS GREAT GUESTS AND THERE IS A LOT TO LAUGH ABOUT.,1391817600,,115,4.0
8619812,5,B00FZWY9UK,"These are three birthday shows, from 1974, 1984 and an extended bonus clip (almost an additional show) from 1987. Buddy Hackett always brought the house down when he appeared; he was very funny any time and very much so on this show from 1974. On the 1984 show, magician Jonathan Brown does a very smooth and polished act, and fans of Paul McCartney will enjoy seeing him 20 years after the Beatles'  U.S. debut with Ed Sullivan. I especially enjoyed David Letterman and Joe Piscopo in the bonus clip; funny to remember that Letterman was Johnny's personal choice to succeed him on ""The Tonight Show"", and that Johnny's only post-retirement appearances were on ""The Late Show With David Letterman"". Joe Piscopo does impressions, complete with props, of Jerry Lewis and (sitting right next to him) David Letterman. The whole disc was great fun.",1389916800,3,843,4.895104895104895
8619813,5,B00FZWY9UK,"If you miss him and the Tonight Show, this series is a must! Highly recommended. It's no wonder it was The Tonight Show ""starring"" Johnny Carson and not ""with"".",1388102400,,160,4.551724137931035
8619814,1,B00FZWY9UK,Sorry to say but I found this dvd very boring. I expected to see some of the funny situations but there was none. Thank you anyway.,1387065600,,131,4.076923076923077
