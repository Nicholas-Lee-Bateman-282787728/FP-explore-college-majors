3652121,5,B001J66JQ8,"A must watch for everyone.

Whether you believe in it or not, whether you agree with it or not, everyone needs to watch this to know the truth.  Afterwards, what you do is up to you.

This DVD/movie/documentary cites from actual scientific literatures and real interviews of actual patients.  The stories (and scientific facts) being presented are true.  I am a healthcare professional and I reviewed the content of this documentary and found the sources to be true and accurate.  It is now up to me to reflect on my own life and work on improving my own health.  It is hard.  It is easier said than done.  But guess what, at least I now know the truth.  It's up to me now to make the right moves.  I sent this to a few colleagues of mine (all healthcare professionals).  We all agreed that we need to do something about ourselves and our diets.  So...  wow.  What an eye-opener.

I hope this documentary inspires you as well.",1477440000,,926,4.455089820359281

The narrative voice is condescending and the boy as a main character makes me think this should be aimed at kids or high school students. I turned it off about three quarters of the way thru, even though I like raw foods, dislike fluoride, and don't trust chemical companies with GMO's etc. The movie moves along slow, but I do agree with their main messages of us humans needing more natural organic unprocessed foods and stuff like that.
At times, they choose data that would support the movies theme, while not presenting the other side well. But this is common in all documentaries, so that's just a minor irritant.",1464220800,,675,4.680672268907563

Charlotte Gerson is doing a great job carrying on the tradition of her father, I recommend to read and watch anything you can by her.  This therapy helped me greatly with digestive problems and chronic fatigue.  One thing I would like to point out though is to make sure you use a juicer that is at least recommended by the Gerson Institute, the centrifugal juicers will not do the job from my experience.  I was using a juiceman and then switched to a champion / welle's press combo and I cannot emphasize enough the dramatic change I experienced, it was night and day.  The Institute mentions this but I don't think it is emphasized enough in other juicing circles and it can make the difference between success and failure!!",1441324800,,793,4.595744680851064

With its focus on nutrition and detoxifying, it directs those needing healing down a path that makes sense. Sadly the powers-that-be have been corrupted by greed and have behaved in ways that are 'less than' to support their position.

This documentary not only talks about the Gerson Therapy but also will get the viewer interested in natural health in general and also wake people up to cancer cure cover ups.  It's important to get people thinking about how regular allopathic medicine isn't necessarily the answer just because that's what you've always done and is what other people are doing as well.
My advice to anyone interested in this video would also be to do further research on the material presented in the documentary.

3652206,1,B001J66JQ8,"Some Gerson therapy advocates will hate me for this review, but they will not be able to deny what I write... Look for comments articulating a specific point I am wrong on... You won't find any....

First of all I am a big time nutritional therapy advocate-
However that certainly does not mean I am not objective. Even though I like parts of Gerson therapy and have even ordered from Gersons's website- this ""documentary"" was nothing but a Gerson therapy infomercial poorly disguised as a teenage boy's journey of exploring the Gerson theories.

Anyone even half way objective should be able to tell right off the bat this is nothing but a completely biased attempt at painting the pharmaceutical companies as evil, and Gerson therapy as a poor little suppressed underdog cancer cure, and a nice little boy discovering the ""truth"" of all this.

Here is a spoiler-  the narrator keeps saying ""the boy"", ""the boy"", ""the boy"", ""the boy""....... Anytime the narrator says something like ""the boy discovered (XYZ)"" that is subtle code language for 'the producers want you to believe (XYZ)' .

Later in the film they interview a cancer survivor. This cancer survivor went back to the mayo clinic to talk with her doctor about her recovery due to Gerson therapy. - according to this ridiculous narrator the police were called and she was ushered away by police ""thinking she was a terrorist"".....

Supposedly the mayo clinic doctor ""wanted to talk, but he was cut off""...... Then the narrator claimed the doctor supposedly is leaving the  mayo clinic so he won't have these boundaries in speaking on the topic......This b.s. Infuriates me....

How often do police simply ""usher away'"" terrorists?  If this mayo clinic doctor really was cut off trying to talk about a cancer cure that would have made this 'documentary'.... What actually happened? The 'documentary' showed some B.S. filler ""footage"" that literally anyone could recreate right now...

Is there any footage or audio of this supposed event? Of course not... Just a generic video of the outside of the clinic, footage of the Gerson advocate in her car on a cellphone, and then a generic video of police lights that were not even by the clinic. There is nothing from this supposed event that I couldn't video edit together myself with a spare evening of googling videos of the mayo clinic, generic police lights, and me on a cellphone in my car.... I could make a better video of an encounter like this without even leaving my driveway....

 I'm not alleging she was never a patient- I am merely making the point that this ridiculous account is very exaggerated at best, if this account was factual the documentary would at a very minimum play the audio when the doctor was cut off...

How often do you talk to your doctor and then someone bursts in and cut off your doctor stating they cannot talk about (XYZ) subject??? What?? Never??? HMMM that's strange.... I thought there were men in black in the hospital always looking to stop doctors from talking about taboo subjects.... Must be only at the secret hospitals... Those secret Area 51 hospitals and Mayo Clinics, they sure are secretive.....

Let's put it this way- if I made a ""documentary"" alleging the president stated to me that he was re-instituting slavery but then his staff cut him off and I was escorted away by police because they thought I was a terrorist.......but then I gave no audio or video evidence except for a video of me in my car on a cellphone, a generic video of the front of the White House, and then police lights....

Would you believe me?...... Of course not.... Only a biased fool who already wants to believe bad things about the president would believe my story....

  This unnamed doctor supposedly leaving the mayo clinic- was he interviewed after leaving the Mayo clinic due to wanting to talk about curing cancer with nutrition?  Of course not.... There is no footage what so ever of these supposed events... No mention of this doctors name for verification, and certainly no follow up interview after supposedly leaving the mayo clinic...

As a law enforcement officer I can tell you- these are exactly the kind of ridiculousness you get from con artists...

Just getting audio of a mayo clinic doctor wanting to speak on nutrition therapy as a cancer cure, being cut off by the mayo clinic, and then giving a follow up interview would have made this 50 times as powerful of a 'documentary'

It's bull crap documentaries like this that discredit nutritional therapists....

You want the real scoop on this movie???? This is the story of a nice young smart innocent looking boy getting pimped out by an infomercial for Gerson therapy and the juiceman juicer....

I cannot tell you how much this frustrates me as I truly try to be unbiased with nutritional therapy.... And unbiased on everything else for that matter....

NO ONE AND I MEAN NO ONE WHO WORKS IN THE MEDICAL COMUNITY WOULD EVER BUY THIS RIDICULOUS STORY! Anyone in the medical community who watches this 'documentary' will see right through the biases b.s. in this film and relate this bias to all nutritional therapists..... Nice going geniuses.....",1406160000,,5158,4.834090909090909

3652217,5,B001J66JQ8,"This was an excellent introduction to Dr. Gerson's method for curing cancer which he developed over 50 years ago.  It is told as a journey of the producer and his son to investigate the Gerson Institute and people who have been healed of cancer using these means.  It gives some compelling information and testimonials as to the effectiveness of these methods to cure cancer.  On the cases that recovered, cancer tests and X-rays/MRIs were done by a 3rd party to prove that the cancer was gone.

One of the most impressive facts was in his original pilot on patients with certain skin diseases about 95% recovered.  That is unheard of.  His original book with 50 solved cancer case studies is great evidence too.

After I rented this I actually bought the BluRay with all 3 Gerson films on it.  The film ""Dying to have Known"" has some great interviews with big name medical Doctors and their ignorance and opinions are shocking.  This information has been suppressed by the AMA and pharma industry because it doesn't align with their money making plan.

The only thing I would like to have seen is some statistics on total success rate of patients treated by the Gerson Institute.  Obviously the ones interviewed recovered, but what is the total success rate?  I have confidence based on what I saw that it is much higher than traditional means.

I wish I would have had this 15 years ago when my dad got cancer.  I would have had him on this.  He didn't make it on surgery, chemo and radiation.  Neither have a few of his friends.

I am going to adopt some of these principles like juicing in my diet to improve my health and resistance.

3652249,5,B001J66JQ8,"One thing that stands out to me in this film is that it is told though the eyes of a young 15 year old boy from Alaska, Garrett Kroschel.  There is probably no better person than an adolescent to ask questions and be inquisitive.  Garrett sets out on a daunting task to find out if indeed there is a ""cure for cancer"".  Whether or not you believe in the Gerson Therapy, the documentary should still leave you questioning everything you've ever read and believed to be true about the treatment and cure for cancer.

One thing becomes clear, unless as a society we evoke change, holistic and alternative healing forms for cancer (and other disease) will never achieve the level of standard medical practices considered cures for cancer as we know them today.  Healthcare, especially in America is BIG business, and as such, controlled by those in power and those with money (pharmaceutical companies, the Government and 'Healthcare' companies).  None of these would ever stand behind the therapies and concepts outlined in this film, because they are not designed for never ending profit.

The film goes further. When Garrett attempts to meet with executives at food giant ConAgra in Omaha, they DENY this 15 year old boy access!  This single moment in the film has changed me - and you will also be moved.  My freezer is now void of anything from ConAgra, and I'm working on the rest, since ConAgra is not alone in the business of food processing.

There is little more I can say - the documentary film is moving, gripping, terrifying and a must-see.  Change must come.  See the film, and act upon what you see.  As a society, we can do better.  You will be left asking yourself why so many diseases are on the rise in modern society, filled with processed and genetically modified food.

3652287,5,B001J66JQ8,"Of the 3 DVDs available talking about the Gerson Therapy, I would watch this first. It is the most interesting and engaging to watch. 1) The Beautiful Truth - 2) Dying to Have Known - 3) The Gerson Miracle.  The latter two (earlier too) go into more detail on the therapy, but are not as good of an introduction as the Beautiful Truth. Though I found the 2nd one to include lots of useful research and perspectives on the Gerson Therapy / methodology and I recommend it as long as one has seen TBT first. Both the first two are recommended even for those who are interested in general well being / nutrition, not just those afflicted with cancer. As the methodology applies to even healing dental cavities naturally too.

Contrary to some reviews, I enjoyed the format of this video. The perspective of focusing on the research of a boy from a 3rd person (father), is similar to the change in perspective one needs to beat cancer or any other chronic disease.

Many factors contribute to whether cancer takes hold in a body (Supposedly we all have cancer cells in our bodies) and this video covers several of them - diet (MSG / glutamate exposure, Fluoride in water, processed foods), environmental (Brief discusson on EMF/cell phones), and pre-existing (Amalgam dental fillings) factors are covered.

Also noted is the psychological hurdle of moving away from the fear/distortion field created by the American Cancer Society, FDA, drug companies, and indoctrination of doctors in failed methods.  As well as fear of doing something out of the mainstream. The shallow research / logic of ""impressively titled"" skeptics is noteworthy - or rather cringe-worthy!

For anyone looking to beat a serious ailment I would recommened numerous other videos to increase conviction to change long set ways/habits and counter powerful marketing / cultural forces directed at us since childhood.  Other DVDs - Killer at Large, Food, Inc, Our Daily Bread, McLibel, King Corn, Future of Food for diet. For EMF - Full Signal, Radiant Day (On Youtube), BBC Panorama Wi-Fi Warning Signal. For toxins in plastic affecting both food and water, environment - Plastic Planet DVD, Tapped DVD, and Disappearing Male - a CBC (Canada) documentary one may find on the Internet. Various other documentaries on the Internet cover in more detail MSG, Fluoride, GMO, and other toxins.  Also the importance of proper lighting - Exploring the Spectrum DVD and reducing stress - NatGeo: Stress - Portrait of a Killer.

3652310,1,B001J66JQ8,"I came to this movie completely ignorant of Gerson and found the documentary intriguing but not informative enough.  As a documentary it's rather flat and the use of ""the boy"" as the narrative catalyst began to wear thin pretty quickly.

Artistic critiques aside, the documentary is misleading in that it takes 90% of the movie to review provable and uncontroversial points about nutrition and then makes two huge logic leaps on coffee enemas and conspiracies to ""prove"" a cancer cure.  Here is the good/bad/ugly on the documentary.

The Good.

On diet recommendations: I don't see how anyone can deny the fundamental premises presented about eating a healthy diet.  No matter where you start,  all nutritional studies say the exact same thing:  limit animal fats, eat more raw vegetables/fruits and avoid processed foods and white foods (pastas, breads, cheeses, etc. do you no favors).  I have never seen any nutritional advice to the contrary.

On the health benefits:  While I have seen little specific literature on a ""Gerson diet"" in scientific literature, I'm go out on a limb and say that it is close enough to a Mediterranean diet or a vegetarian diet to call it even.  Focusing on the Med diet, the scientific literature is prolific and positive.  Health benefits include everything from diabetes prevention, weight loss, general health and, yes, even CANCER PREVENTION.  So there is little controversy about the health benefits of the diet prescribed.

The Bad.

There are several misleading statements made in the documentary.  For example, since the medical community endorses the diet described, then how can a claim be made that there is an effort to suppress the results of the cancer benefits of such a diet?

When the documentary makes a claim that can easily be checked, then why not check it?

The Ugly.

There is an element of manipulation in the film.  As noted above, even when the medical community comes to the support of the documentary's conclusions there is no mention.  The reason is that when the final two claims are made, that coffee enemas are beneficial and that enemas and diet CURES cancer rather than help prevent it, the documentary needs to make a villain of doctors, big pharma and any other skeptic by claiming that the lack of evidence is a conspiracy of silence.

People are presented saying that they find little evidence that Gerson is a cure but they are never allowed to say why.  I will not present the reasons why the medical community agrees with 90% of the movie but not the final claims that, when combined with coffee enemas, it is a cure, you'll need to do that yourself and come to your own opinion.  My criticism is that the documentary does not do so.

I would expect that the film maker present the specific questions doctors are asking of the Gerson community about cure rates.  You can determine yourself if the medical community's standards are good measures; but remember that they are the same standards used to state that the Mediterranean diet can help prevent cancer.

So if you believe the medical journals that says that Gerson got it right about diet and its benefits regarding cancer prevention, what do you want to hear about the science regarding Gerson's claims about a cure?

Enough said.  Go ahead now, feel free to tear apart this review in the comments, it seems like any less-than-five-star review is being taken to task.",1320364800,,3399,4.871080139372823
3652311,4,B001J66JQ8,"I have watched this several times and absolutely love it.  It gives a lot of information that everyone needs to know about the cronyism seen in the food, chemical, drug, and medical industries (yes, I purposely put ""medical"" as an ""industry"") in relationship to the government.  Their ongoing pursuit of profit (and I'm quite the capitalist, but this isn't it) at the expense of the health and lives of their fellow humans is disgusting and frightening.

This little movie looks at a young man's journey of seeking information about health, diet, and a cure for cancer (his mother died from it).  I enjoyed the story, but was bothered by a couple of items that were dead wrong or glossed over, which is typical of Steve Kroschel otherwise stellar work.

The first part of the movie had a section that focused on the work of Weston A. Price, a dentist who, along with his wife, traveled all over the world to study cultures untouched by civilization and studied the rate of dental caries.  He was surprised to find that there was little incident of caries in the cultures who did not have contact with ""foods of modern commerce"" as he called them. Chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc.,) were practically unknown. The subsequent generations, however, were impacted negatively once they became westernized and ate western-type diets.  In all of these cultures, animal products were an important part of the diet.  There were no vegan cultures. In fact, Dr. Price noted that in once incident (in Africa), the culture that had adopted an agrarian lifestyle was completely dominated by another that had not (this is in Nutrition and Physical Degeneration - a stellar work).  Dr. Price emphasized this point over and over again as he visited each culture.

You'd never know it from this movie which promotes vegetarian and vegan lifestyles as far more healthy than eating meat - irony indeed.  That's just not true if the meat comes from a clean animal source which, unfortunately, is practically unknown today.  So I could argue that the availability of different vegetables year round makes vegetarianism healthy, but all things considered, the natural state of man is at least as an *occasional* meat eater.

The second thing that bothered me was the discussion of the teeth of a carnivore (in this case, a wolf) in comparison to the teeth of herbivores.  They also compared the short digestive tract of a carnivore with the longer digest tract of a herbivore. Therefore, the rationale stated, humans are meant to be herbivorous because of our flat teeth and longer GIs.

Two things sprang immediately to mind:  one, {{as a generality}} animals who are herbivorous with flat teeth generally chew their cud (sheep, cows).  We don't.  Our so-called nearest relatives (chimps, gorillas) have as ferocious looking a set of canines as just about any hard-core carnivore. Once again, we don't.

A quick search will take you to any number of scientific studies which compares the human digestive tract to those of OTHER OMINIVORES including bears and chimpanzees, and states it as such.

So an oft-stated assertion made by vegans regarding the human digestive system as being the same as other herbivores is wrong on many, many different levels.

With all of that being said, the movie is otherwise enjoyable, and considering the serious and sobering subject, actually entertaining in that it makes you sit there and watch it.

While I still believe that Steve Kroschel gets a little too PC and ""precious"" in some of his statements, he still has good insight and did a good job with this movie.

We are killing ourselves and suffering needlessly as a select few make billions of dollars through the weaknesses of humans.

This is why today I cannot support movies like this more. The message is brilliant - take responsibility for your health, get to know your food, start eating real, whole, nutritious food not packaged chemical products, cleanse and detox your body, reduce toxic exposure, learn about how you conduct your life, focus on what really matters, do away with toxic emotions...

The movie is done very well for being a small-time production. The visuals are pleasant, the narrator coherent, the interviewees valuable, the quality professional, the message priceless!

If everyone could just see this film with an open mind and heart, what a different world it would be. This film may not be perfect, but it is perfect at showing us that today we DO have CHOICES. We do not need to be puppets to the pharmaceutical industries and we definitely do not need to consider ourselves victims, once we take our thoughts and habits into our own hands.

I understand that the people who negate this film are still stuck on seeing medical science as God, or deeply hurting from losing their loved ones. I am sorry for that. However, if we just allow ourselves a window of new perspective to shine in, we can liberate ourselves from the clutches we find ourselves in today.

I beg that anyone out there that is sick and thinking about forgoing modern medicine to pursue this type of treatment thoroughly research each aspect of the treatment BEFORE switching. And by research I mean, look up each of their claims. For a start, try Googling ""Kirlian photography"" and reading some of the sites. You might just find the ""auras"" they refer to can be created with non-living things like coins too and that this method was mostly used as parlor trick decades ago. I'd also like to point out that CBS's 60 Minutes did a report titled ""21st Century Snake Oil"" about the treatment center in Mexico.

If you do nothing else, at least research how new treatments are studied and approved.

Yes, statistics can lie, and it would be great to see some scientific stats on the cure rates but as the movie points out, pharmaceutical companies would lose out if the diseases they say they try to cure were actually cured.  Do you think Exxon wants to promote solar energy?  Do you think Chrysler wanted to promote mass transit?  Do you think Winston-Salem tobacco wanted it known that their cigarettes were not cool and killed people?  Corporations will not fund studies that question their own products.  Wake up to the profit motive people.  People (and corporations) will threaten and kill to keep their wealth.

I found this movie to be inspiring, especially shot from the viewpoint of a teenager.  While the production itself wasn't a huge budget, the logic, thoughts, and exploration made this an interesting adventure.  If you already have your mind made up that there are no alternative therapies than our traditional medicines I feel sorry for you not having and open mind and for not being able to consider something that might prolong the life of your loved ones.

I will concede that organic diets reduce the risks of certain ailments, but it is by no means a cure for just about any disease, especially cancer.  How can anyone possibly believe that a man found a cure to EVERYTHING in the early 1900's, at a time where our medical knowledge was limited at best?  If you look at some follow-up studies on many Gerson Therapy cancer patients, you'll discover that a great majority of them still had active cancer, are dead, or were receiving real treatments in conjunction with Gerson's therapy (which includes a coffee enema, BTW).

Aside from the radical and questionable ideas in the documentary, I hated the way the creator exploited his son.  I have no problem with the Steve Kroschel encouraging his son to eat a balanced vegan diet.  However, I do have a problem with Steve pulling his son out of real school to brainwash him with conspiracy theories and medically unsound practices.  What's going to happen when his kid actually has a medical issue later in life and he doesn't trust a hospital to treat him?  Aside from the harm Steve is causing his son,  I just wanted to mention how misleading the documentary is the a majority of the time about their relationship.  Until the end, Steve simply calls his son ""the boy"" and himself ""the father,"" implying that he isn't the father.  It also implies that his son was making these 'revelations' independently.  Obviously, if Steve is the father, the boy was being manipulated by his father's quack ideas.

All in all, don't be confused by the star rating.  This is a terrible, conspiracy-minded documentary that will leave you with a sour taste in your mouth.

For anyone struggling with cancer or watching a loved one or friend going through the conventional treatments, the information in this movie could show them a different way to tackle this. When society is able to see chemotherapy and radiation for the destructive system it really is, we can begin to counter cancer and let our bodies heal.",1267315200,,741,4.975806451612903

3652372,5,B001J66JQ8,"This is a beautiful DVD!  The main feature is very good and illuminating.  However the bonus feature titled: ""The Gerson Therapy: A director's Perspective"" -- is simply THE BEST!!!  Just for the bonus feature alone, this DVD is worth its weight in diamonds.  I don't believe there is another testimonial in the entire world that can make a believer out of everyone like those shown in the bonus feature will!

How come the US Congress has not set up a investigation committee at the highest levels of government to understand why alternate approaches, of which Max Gerson's is one such, are so effective where modern medicine has failed completely?  How come the Gerson approach is able to heal terminally ill cancer patients, with life expectancies in weeks, when modern medicine had sent them home to die?  Why is Gerson's approach so successful using non-invasive and non-barbaric procedrues in contrast to modern medicine?  How come these terminally ill people are alive decades later looking vibrant and full of life, with absolutely no signs of mutilation?  Why are these success stories not broadcast 24/7 on cable TV networks?  When was the last time you watched someone who had been mutilated, nuked, chemo-ed etc come forth with accolades for the treatment they underwent?  There are many such questions that need to be answered.

However, like in every such case where the truth stands out but the answers are not forthcoming, one need only follow the money trail.  The US Congress and the regulatory agencies -- USDA and FDA, are in the back pockets of Big Pharma and the AMA.  Its so simple!  The ""big guys"" in the USDA and FDA are mostly former executives of Bigh Pharma or the multinational agribusiness.  So its a ""old boys"" network between them with revolving doors.  This is why such practices are allowed to persist while the medical establishment rakes in some $700,000 per cancer patient.  The only loser in all this is the patient, who loses body parts, gets nuked (radiated), chemically treated with the most toxic substances known to man, mutilated by the knife and eventually dies, if not from the cancer itself, then from the treatment!  Dante's version of hell is not in some nether world, but it exists right in our biggest and best medical schools, hospitals, nursing homes and such care facilities.

The whole dread complex around the disease of cancer drummed up my the Big Pharma, medical establishment, the American Medical Association (AMA), National Cancer Institute (NCI), American Cancer Society (ACS)and the rest is just a myth.  They are completely, and I mean COMPLETELY on the wrong track when it comes to addressing the causes of chronic, degenerative and terminal illnesses.  They have failed abysmally.  They are like the three stooges trying to fix a problem they know nothing about!

The dread complex around such terminal diseases as cancer and others is deliberately engendered by Big Pharma and the AMA, to generate funds and sympathy for their failures at producing a cure.  They need the dread complex to justify ""Walk for the cure"", bake sales, lapel pins, pink ribbons etc I cannot find enough words in the English dictionary to express my contempt and repugnance towards Big Pharma, the AMA, medical schools and the physicians of the entire medical establishments.  They are not at all the learned people they think they are.  They have completely forgotten two of Hippocrates proclamations, ""Do no harm"", and ""Let your food be your medicine, and let your medicine be your food."" A humble colon irrigation technician at a health spa does more good for the cause of healing than all these buffoons with a string of degrees following their names.

One would think that for the benefit of humanity they would step aside and let the Gerson therapy heal these cases.  One would think that the US Congress would immediately investigate these cases and revamp the curriculums across the medical schools in this country to incorporate this approach to healing patients.  After all, is not the health care budget a VERY LARGE portion of the total fiscal budget?  Are not the health care costs the most significant concern for the entire US population, specially the increasingly aging population?

This DVD must be compulsory viewing for any one interested in true health care.  If anyone in your family or circle of friends and co-workers has cancer, or any other chronic, degenerative or terminal illness, please have them watch this DVD!  The cure is very simple.  Its all centered around detoxification and proper nourishment.  Please recall -- THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS SIMPLE!!!

Like I wrote before, the bonus feature on this DVD is the single greatest testimonial to the success story for the healing of cancer and other degenerative diseases!  It is most definitely NOT the incurable disease that it has been made out to be.  I know I'll be buying several copies of this DVD to counterbalance the propaganda of the entire medical establishment.

Along with this DVD, I would recommend the following list of titles for all those interested in a solid healing program, and a health program for life.

Healing requires a full hearted commitment so as to accomplish a dramatic change in lifestyle.  Successful healing is impossible solely by consuming medication.  Surgery, mutilation through radiation and chemo, bone marrow transplants etc are all highly dangerous and unnecessary procdures.  The toxic nature of the chemicals and radiation speak for themself.  Ask the physicians and nurses as to why so many of them would turn down these options if they were ever diagnosed with cancer.

Please take my advice in these matters and educate yourself thoroughly about different options.  Watch DVDs like this one and hear testimonies from patients who recovered.  Try all non-invasive procedures available through holistic healing approaches -- colon cleansing, raw living foods, massages and steam bath, any and all detox procedures etc  Only as a last resort should one hand over one's body for experimentation and mutilation.",1263600000,,6535,5.400789733464956

Garrett is a 15-year old boy living in the Alaskan wilderness with a menagerie of orphaned animals. Growing up close with nature has given him
a deep understanding of nutritional needs required by diet sensitive animals on the reserve. Unfortunately, the untimely and tragic death of his mother propelled him into a downward spiral and he risked flunking out of school. This led to his father's decision to home-school Garrett.
His first assignment was to study a controversial book written by Dr. Max Gerson.

Written over 50 years ago, Dr. Gerson found that diet could, and did, cure cancer. Controversial at the time (and even today), Garrett took on the challenge of researching this amazing therapy, which drew the interest of his neighbors in the small Alaskan community.
With the help of Dr. Gerson's daughter, Charlotte Gerson, and grandson, Howard Strauss, they gave him the ammunition needed to go in search
for the truth - a truth that would affect not only him, but his entire Alaskan village - all of whom wanted to know if these claims were true. After a number of cancer patients, who were diagnosed as terminal, shared their stories and their medical records with Garrett, it becameabundantly clear that, contrary to the disinformation campaign spear-headed by the multi-billion dollar medical and pharmaceutical industry, a cure for virtually all cancers and chronic diseases does exist - and has existed for over 80 years!

3652391,5,B001J66JQ8,"It has been said that more people live off cancer than die from it. The Beautiful Truth is a movie that can put a stop to this travesty. Here is a very practical guide to the intensive nutritional treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases that many would consider to have been impossible to obtain. But thanks to the work of Max Gerson, M.D., and his daughter, Charlotte Gerson, this knowledge is readily available.

Max Gerson cured cancer. He did so with a strict fat-free, salt-free, low-protein, essentially vegetarian dietary regimen, based on great quantities of fresh vegetable juice, supplements, and systemic detoxification. Ms. Gerson explains:

""Dr. Gerson found that the underlying problems of all cancer patients are toxicity and deficiency. He had to overcome both these difficulties. He found that one of the important features of his therapy had to be the hourly administration of fresh vegetable juices. These supply ample nutrients, as well as fluids to help flush out the kidneys. When the high levels of nutrients re-enter tissues, toxins accumulated over many years are forced into the blood stream. The toxins are then filtered out by the liver. The liver is easily overburdened by the continuous release of toxins and is unable to release the load. Dr. Gerson found that he could provide help to the liver by the caffeine in coffee, absorbed from the colon via the hemorrhoidal vein, which carries the caffeine to the portal system and then to the liver. The caffeine stimulates the liver/bile ducts to open, releasing the poisons into the intestinal tract for excretion.""

Some of the blunt, uncompromising statements this movie makes are certain to get up the medical profession's collective nose. Too bad for them, for Dr. Gerson was right. And as for Charlotte, his daughter, her entire life has been immersed in healing people, first learning while assisting her father, and later teaching his method to the world.

I personally have seen what the Gerson program can do for a terminally ill cancer patient. I have been called upon to help in a couple of high-profile but last minute cases. One patient was a well-known sports figure. He was given some months to live and was not happy about it, as he was still in his 50s. He asked what his best shot would be for inoperable, untreatable metastasized cancer. I told him: the Gerson therapy. He did it, not in its entirety, but with enthusiasm. And, he lived considerably longer that he was expected to. But what really impressed me was the dramatic improvement in his energy level. From fatigue and weakness, he went instantly to a vibrant life, commencing from the very week he started the program. He maintained a more-than-full schedule for so long that even people who knew he was sick forgot that he was sick.

Years later, people that never knew of my involvement in the matter would bring up his name, invariably recalling how active he was and how good he looked until, almost as a surprise, he died.

I saw a similar level of success with a prominent New York businessman, the owner of a chain of stores and afflicted with untreatable liver cancer.  He began to do much, but by no means all, of the Gerson program, and was subsequently able to extensively travel the world with his family.  He lived years longer than expected, with a high quality of life confirmed by all who saw him.

Looking only at these two patients, wanton critics of Gerson's method might think that, without complete and unequivocal cure, there is little to crow about.  Such a view is unproductive, for neither of these patients followed the Gerson program completely. It is a tough sell, even to a person with a terminal diagnosis.

Why is this?

Ignorance and arrogance make a bad combination, and ""modern"" medicine has been guilty of both for decades. Political physicians did not heed Dr. Gerson. In fact, they publicly condemned him. The news media, and some so-called ""consumer"" websites, have been their willing accomplices. The misinformation they spew to this day is fraught with fabricated frights of natural therapies, while in the same breath they spew forth the wonders of pharmaceutical drugs. When is the last time you saw a favorable mention of the Gerson program in the newspaper or on TV? Since pharmacological doctors have no sure-fire cure for cancer (an understatement if there ever was one), they might at least back a winning horse. According to peer-reviewed research, conventional chemotherapy contributes 2.3% to five year survival in Australia and a mere 2.1% in the US. (Morgan, Ward and Barton. Clinical Oncology, 2004. 16: 549-560) The Gerson approach has been shown, for over six decades, to significantly improve both quality of life and length of life in the sickest, the most hopeless, of cancer patients. Many people have been completely cured on the Gerson therapy. Not all, but many. Far, far more than with chemo.

Some years ago I watched a video tape of a Gerson patients' ""reunion.""  On stage were people from all walks of life, and most were advanced in age. One after the other they spoke of the cancer they were diagnosed with three, ten, or twenty years ago. All were recovered. Dr. Gerson was the reason. You cannot watch such an event and fail to be moved.

Charlotte Gerson is 87 now (2009) and fit as a fiddle. I've met her many times. She glows with energy and vivaciousness and life. But what is much more important, so do the vast majority of Gerson patients. I urge you to watch this movie.",1240963200,,5520,4.8636847710330136
3652392,1,B001J66JQ8,"[...]Proponents of the Gerson diet claim that cancer can be cured only if toxins are eliminated from the body. They recommend ""detoxification"" with frequent coffee enemas and a low-sodium diet that includes more than a gallon a day of juices made from fruits, vegetables, and raw calf's liver. This method was developed by Max Gerson, a German-born physician who emigrated to the United States in 1936 and practiced in New York City until his death in 1959. Gerson therapy is still available at Hospital Meridien in Tijuana, Mexico and, since February 1997, at the Gerson Healing Center in Sedona, Arizona.

Gerson therapy is still actively promoted by his daughter, Charlotte Gerson, through lectures, talk show appearances, and publications of the Gerson Institute in Bonita, California. Gerson protocols have included liver extract injections, ozone enemas, ""live cell therapy,"" thyroid tablets, royal jelly capsules, linseed oil, castor oil enemas, clay packs, laetrile, and vaccines made from influenza virus and killed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.

In 1947, the NCI reviewed ten cases selected by Dr. Gerson and found his report unconvincing. That same year, a committee appointed by the New York County Medical Society reviewed records of 86 patients, examined ten patients, and found no evidence that the Gerson method had value in treating cancer. An NCI analysis of Dr. Gerson's book A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases concluded in 1959 that most of the cases failed to meet the criteria (such as histologic verification of cancer) for proper evaluation of a cancer case [16]. A recent review of the Gerson treatment rationale concluded: (a) the ""poisons"" Gerson claimed to be present in processed foods have never been identified, (b) frequent coffee enemas have never been shown to mobilize and remove poisons from the liver and intestines of cancer patients, (c) there is no evidence that any such poisons are related to the onset of cancer, (d) there is no evidence that a ""healing"" inflammatory reaction exists that can seek out and kill cancer cells [17].

Between 1980 and 1986 at least 13 patients treated with Gerson therapy were admitted to San Diego area hospitals with Campylobacter fetus sepsis attributable to the liver injections [18]. None of the patients was cancer-free, and one died of his malignancy within a week. Five were comatose due to low serum sodium levels, presumably as a result of the ""no sodium"" Gerson dietary regimen. As a result, Gerson personnel modified their techniques for handling raw liver products and biologicals. However, the Gerson approach still has considerable potential for harm. Deaths also have been attributed to the coffee enemas administered at the Tijuana clinic.

Charlotte Gerson claims that treatment at the clinic has produced high cure rates for many cancers. In 1986, however, investigators learned that patients were not monitored after they left the facility [19]. Although clinic personnel later said they would follow their patients systematically, there is no published evidence that they have done so. A naturopath who visited the Gerson Clinic in 1983 was able to track 21 patients over a 5-year period (or until death) through annual letters or phone calls. At the 5-year mark, only one was still alive (but not cancer-free); the rest had succumbed to their cancer [20].",1239494400,,3358,5.247672253258846
