1082721,5,6305835322,"This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time - in English or otherwise. With all the hysteria about Iran, it is easy to forget that there is suburbia in Iran just like in California. In fact, at times I forgot that I was watching in a movie shot in Iran. If you are interested in seeing an Iranian movie that is not a fairly tale, see this movie.

1082722,5,6305835322,"One wonders why so many great films are being made by Iranian Directors.  With all focus on Iran as a confining religious state, one forgets that it s a country rich in cultural history.  This is the story of a woman who can not bear children and the relentless schemes of the mother-in-law to break up the marriage.  Leila slowly succumbs to the constant pressure and allows or rather prods her husband to seek out a second wife.  The director does not allow the audience to easily pick heros and villians.  With the exception of the mother-in-law (who one never likes) each character if filled with strength and weekness.  One is intrigued and can't wait to see how the husband and wife will confront each scene.  Part of the greatness of this film is that it portrays the universality of human feelings.  While we get a peek into everyday life in Iran, we get to know that individuals are the same everywhere.",989020800,11,912,4.58641975308642

You enter the lives of a couple and their families, and you will not soon forget them. In the best sense of great literature, the protagonists are parochial but the subject matter is thoroughly universal. Any couple that has ever discussed the question of whether marital love needs children will especially enjoy this deep, powerful film.

1082803,4,6305835322,"This was a great movie with great acting especially the woman who played Leila. The husband character disgusted me, not only did he fail to stand up to  his  mother, he blamed Leila for everything.  Then again she should have stood up for herself, but her motivation was pure even though it wrecked their lives. Her father-in-law was against it, but did nothing or couldn't do anything. If anyone thinks the muslim husband is king in his home will find out differently.
This movie will not give you insight in the daily lives of Iranians as the people were rich.

Parvin treated herself as a surrogate mother with open adoption and took her role that way, so that made this interesting in how it would be resolved.

I was disgusted that Leila neither valued herself enough nor did she appear to seek to refocus from obsessing on her infertility and look to other joys and outlets in life.  I was disgusted that no one had a spine in dealing with the mother-in-law.  I was disgusted with the false hope suggested--what a downer.

However, stronger family opinions and cultural values altered the trajectory of their lives as the husband was encouraged to find and take a 2nd wife to bear him a child.

1082900,2,6305835322,"An interesting idea for a story, which, unfortunately, is told by moderately-skilled actors working with less than imaginative dialogue and poor filming techniques.  I concede that I might appreciate the dialogue more if I didn't have to rely on the subtitles, but the almost monotone delivery in every scene fails to bring out the true emotions associated with the unfortunate circumstances central to the story.  Also, Persian women usually have beautiful eyes, but Leila's appear lifeless...without anger, without despair, generally without feeling.  The actors are not ""wooden,"" but only Reza's father brings his part to life...and only briefly as he is a minor character.  Additionally, every scene is shot with poor lighting in uninspired settings.  I found the The Stoning of Soraya M. a much better film in all categories of evaluation, and the wonderful film Children of Heaven spoke to my heart.  Had I never seen these two films, Leila would have left me with a poor impression of both Iranian culture and Iranian film.",1386374400,,1030,5.174698795180723
1082901,5,6305835322,"Thi film, which was brought to America in 1999, was written and directed by Dariush Mehrjui who was trained in filmmaking at UCLA and has gone on to produce many outstanding films. Mostly it is about a young lady who is being pressured by her mother in law to accept polygamy in a time when it has been decreasing in popularity.

Throughout her struggle with this she goes on to learn to ignore the influences that would cause her to lose her willpower and strength to go own in her life. Her co wife helps stabilify her home life but the husband is weak and refuses to confront his mother as he is perplexed. The film is paced so well and ends so eloquently that, trust me, you don't want to be disturbed by any other sights or sounds for a long time after.

1082902,4,6305835322,"When I saw ""Leila"" pop-up on my Netflix recommended list, I was drawn in by the story about a young, happily married couple and how their lives are ruined by a domineering matriarch. Well, the plot is really that simple, but the manner in which it is told is credibly done, with a compelling performance by the actress who portrays the tortured Leila. Set in Tehran, Iran, Leila (Leila Hatami) narrates the story of her married life - she marries a handsome young man from an affluent family, Reza (Ali Mosaffa) in an arranged marriage, but the couple genuinely fall in love. This is altogether credible because many traditional communities practice arranged marriages, and I've witnessed some very happy unions as a result of this practice. Leila and Reza's happiness is short-lived when they are unable to have children, even after being married for two years. A visit to the doctor reveals that Leila is barren, and this provides Reza's domineering mother with an excuse to start harassing her son to take a second wife (in traditional Muslim societies, a man may take up to four wives and this is allowed under Sharia law).

Initially, Reza balks at this idea because he is perfectly content with his married life, and loves his wife. Leila however, begins to feel the pressure exerted by her mother-in-law and aunt, and after constant badgering, she gives in and agrees to Reza taking a second wife. A lot of the movie centers on how Leila copes with her emotions as she witnesses her husband go through the ritual of meeting one woman after another, trying to determine who will be the perfect match for him. In case anybody wondered as to the credibility of this plot, I can say that it is quite credible. I grew up in Malaysia and Singapore, and witnessed many marriages which came under similar pressure when the couple were not able to have children. In Malaysia, just like in Iran, a Muslim man can take a second wife if his first wife is unable to have children (though just like in Iran, the first wife's consent is required, though many men get around this using creative ways!).

The movie at two hours long, does tend to drag at times, especially in the tedious scenes of Leila doing voice-overs as her husband checks out a prospective wife-to-be. The lead actor does a great job though of portraying her emotional anguish, although at times I felt very frustrated at Leila's lack of strong will to defy her mother-in-law. Reza comes off as a spineless coward who keeps on protesting his love for Leila, but does not do much to stand up against his mother, even when he has his father's moral support. It shows a culture where the matriarch has a lot of power in manipulating her family, and this mirrors life in some other communities as well.

On the whole, I found Leila to be a compelling yet frustrating watch.",1295136000,,2831,4.669338677354709
1082903,5,6305835322,"I must admit that I'm a bit surprised by many of the others' reviews--it seems as though many others turned the film off before the very final scene, the last words and glimpse of Leila.  That one moment in the film turns the entire film around--and left me with a much richer view of the film than the more obvious interpretation.  The devastation of that film is not what ""happens"" to Leila, which has been seen by some has her ""choice,"" but what happens to the little girl.  For in that last scene, we finally learn of Leila's determination all along, and her manipulation of her very limited conditions, given the family pressures!  So a woman who began the movie as innocent, perhaps naive, but certainly cowed by pressures learns throughout to manipulate the mother-in-law, the husband, and the second wife, allowing her to come out as victim and hero of her life by ""fashioning"" a child she can raise.
The loss, to me, is to the little girl whose last glance assures us that she, too, will learn how to manipulate in an underhanded way, just like her mother.",1209945600,2,1065,4.589473684210526
1082904,5,6305835322,"Note: Product Details for this DVD is incorrect, this film is not presented in English. It's Farsi with English subtitles.

The '98 film 'Leila' is an artistic, heart wrenching tale examining the power of tradition and family and its long term effects on two loving, caring people. Reza (Ali Mosaffa) and his new wife Leila (Leila Hatami) appear to have the perfect marriage until the fateful day she discovers she is unable to bear children. While her husband is supportive and unconcerned with the prospects of a childless marriage his family, more specifically his Mother, attempt to take matters in their own hands and convince Reza to take a second wife and secure the family legacy with the birth of a son. Can Reza and Leila survive the expectations of tradition and extended family or will their marriage falter under the onslaught ahead?

Director Dariush Mehrjui has delivered a bittersweet, poignant film about love and loss. The two main characters, Reza and Leila work extremely well together as a married couple, they should since they are man and wife off screen as well. Jamileh Sheikhi is also wonderful as the zealous, overbearing and opinionated Mother-in-Law, serving as the perfect counterpoint to her shy, demure daughter-in-law.

Of course true to the name of the film Leila Hatami is the undisputed star of this production. That face, those eyes and her ability to exude so much interior emotion with nothing more than a fleeting expression or subtle shift in body language is amazing. Truly one of the pure beauties of cinema, foreign or domestic.",1186358400,2,1572,4.99236641221374
1082905,5,6305835322,"I just finished watching this movie and although I enjoyed it, I couldn't help feeling anger towards the two main characters.  Reza and Leila obviously love each other but neither can stand up to Reza's overbearing mother.  The mother is not vicious or tyrannical.  She apeals to Leila's sense of duty (along with tears and a string of pearls). Reza has no backbone whatsoever.  He even admits to being forced to marry Leila.  He is the only son in a house of sisters and the pressure to marry was great.  Fortunately for Leila, he falls in love with her.  But one can see how easy it is for Reza's mother to manipulate him into a second marriage.  Instead of saying 'no', he leaves the decision up to Leila.  Whatever she wants, he will do.  What Leila wants most is a child but that is not to be.  What she wants most is for Reza have a son and for her mother in law to leave her alone.  When Reza finally gives in, she has a breakdown.  This was a very interesting look into Iranian culture.  For those who have preconceived notions about how these marriages are, it was a nice window to see that love can happen even when these marriages are arranged.",1181347200,4,1155,4.36150234741784
1082936,4,6305835322,"""Leila"" is an Iranian film that came out in 1996.  It's a vital film to watch if you're interested in the status of women in the Middle East.

The action takes place entirely in Tehran.  The plot concerns the agonies of the titular character, a young woman who discovers shortly after marriage that she is infertile.  As the movie grinds on, we witness her eventually caving in to the relentless pressure originating from her officious mother-in-law, whose only desire in the world is to have a grandson.

Therefore Leila accedes:  she agrees to stand meekly by as her husband takes a second, hopefully more fertile bride (up to four brides are permitted in Islam).  Hijinks ensue.

Judging by this film, the director is quite a talent.  The script, while not astonishing, is bold and carefully constructed.  The acting is passable but not sensational.

The quality of the print itself is atrocious:  a galaxy of white flecks dance happily around the screen throughout the entire feature, and the film can boast running scratches in more than a few places.

As for the subtitles, they are in English and that's that.  They cannot be disabled or changed to Farsi.  The letters are white without black edges, but visibility is rarely a problem.  Spelling and grammatical errors are legion.

My beef is with the cinematographer:  that's some pretty cruddy work you've turned in, whoever you are.  Faces are frequently a flushed red, as are many interiors, to the point where you start to believe that the fashion in Tehran these days is to light your living room so that it resembles a photographic dark room.  Sheesh!  Ever heard of lighting temperature?

Alas!  The film cuts Iranian culture to the bone in a way that makes Iranians themselves visibly uncomfortable when they watch it.  The situation Leila finds herself in is reasonably common in Iran, as it is, I suspect, in nearly all socially primitive socieites.

The purpose of women, you see, is to pop out male heirs.  Not simply help raise and nature male sons, no, no; they have to be from our bloodlines, dang it!  Not adopted, or our lives will be ruined!  And if you can't deliver the goods, I'll find a woman who can!

Sigh.  But if the renown of films like this is any indication (""Leila"" is highly regarded in Iran), this society can only be headed for improvements.

And you're gonna hate that phone!",1178409600,3,2367,4.75615763546798
1082937,5,6305835322,"If you want to watch a film with a true love between a husband and wife, I'd highly recommend this film. A husband is allowing his wife to make her own decisions and create a mutual discussion platform. This must be a very important feature of genuine love between a couple in an UNEXPECTED geography.

However, there is often a third person who is not happy with the two's happiness. This third person is sometimes the whole society, sometimes a single person. Let's call it ""the third eye."" In this culture, people believe in nazar (the envy and maybe grudge of other people). And the director clearly portrays the evil eye hanging next to the entrance door to the house of the couple (Leila and Reza). Yes, there are several ways to keep that third eye away from destructing the happiness of the two. ""Dua"" (praying to God) keeps the relationship safe and healthy from harm. Dua is the core of life. Dua is the core of strong belief in God. That's what we see in the film many actors are praying for the sake of Reza (the husband) and Leila (the wife).

*Evil Eye is just one of those traditions to keep the envy of the society or those people jealous of the couple's happiness.

Reza is a very nice gentleman offering his wife presents and treats in several occasions. He takes her out and he LISTENS to her. This is a portrayal of the true possibility of MUTUAL LOVE existing in a place with lots of biased views about it. The plot takes place in Iran and many people have very biased views about the country. You can immediately recognize the veil Leila (the main actor) wearing on the cover of the DVD. What does it imply? Oh, this is just another middle Eastern movie? I guess not. So, please leave your BIASED VIEWS and give this film a try.

There is a culture embedded in this film. The culture of Islam is truly reflected in many occasions without favoring the extremist side or ""modernized"" side. There is very well balance constructed in this film. I heard from another reviewer that the director had his college education in the US. However, the director did not bring a stranger's eye to an everyday possible event of a marriage without a child.

This film might also be directed from a stranger's eye through many ways. The veil might be recognized as a false practice, or say the women's rights might be discussed, or the husband might be rejecting his customs and hold his wife's hand publicly, and even kiss her in the street.

No, there is no stranger's eye in this film. It is fresh from the roots of the culture, and I congratulate the director to clearly articulating the customs of his country and still portraying a very usual problem in marriage (which is the must of having a son to continue the generation of the man).",1174262400,4,2747,4.506024096385542

1082939,5,6305835322,"A high number of Iranians love Americas.  Some hate us intensely.  This film has nothing directly to do with political themes.  However, we can learn how numerous affluent and well educated Iranians straddle the fence between embracing Western values and those of Islam. Leila is unable to get pregnant.  Her husband Reza still loves her and accepts this sad state of affairs.  However, Reza's mother is not so understanding.  She'll either have a grandchild so that her family's bloodline doesn't disappear from the face of this earth---or there will be hell to pay.  Iranian law allows Reza to have a second wife.  Leila is harassed until she give in to her mother-in-law's desires.  Can the marriage survive?  Are the women of Iran doomed to remain second class citizens?  When push turns to shove, will reactionary Muslim beliefs continue to dominate the culture?

I saw this well done movie over two months ago, and I can't get it out of my mind.  It finally dawned on me why I found it so disturbing.  Iran is one of the most modern of Islamic countries.  It may also possess nuclear military capabilities.  A man like Reza surrendered to the pressures of his reactionary mother.  What might happen if his religious leaders call for a jihad against the United States?  Could he kill us out of a sense of duty?",1127347200,7,1315,4.743362831858407
1082940,4,6305835322,"I initially was not interested in watching this movie in the least.  My dear mother-in-law was visiting from Iran and desperately needed to have some feminine Iranian contact. Not knowing what else to do I popped to the local library and checked out Leila. Holy cow. She was watching it and all of a sudden I heard this weeping coming out of her room!! And she was happier than she'd been in weeks. She wanted me to watch it with her, and hoping to help bridge our cultural gap I did. Pretty soon my father-in-law had to come in to the room to find out what all the crying was about. It's an incredible tragic story, heartbreaking. I personally do NOT like heartbreaking movies like this, I found myself becoming quite upset with the families involved, but my MIL and other Iranian women that I know love it. It quickly was her movie of choice and yes, she cried buckets each and every time she watched it...and then felt so much better afterwards. If you are in need of a good cry, or just a very intense human drama, go for it! If you're like me and just don't really enjoy being tossed around emotionally, approach with caution. It IS very well made. Just more than I was prepared to absorb.",1126569600,9,1194,4.402714932126697
1082941,4,6305835322,"Having a certain fondness for contemporary Iranian cinema, I have tried to see everything that is available. Leila is a marked departure from the more subtle storytelling of films like The White Balloon or A Taste of Cherry, grappling with interesting societal issues, portraying the middle ground between tradition and modernity. In the film, Leila and her husband Reza live a contemporary lifestyle; both appear happy and in love. However, their desire to start a family is stymied by the fact that Leila is in fact barren and cannot produce any children. Reza in particular seems to be a very progressive and supportive husband, assuring Leila that he loves her no matter what and that having children is not his main focus. His focus is their happiness and relationship. Unfortunately Leila's insecurity grows as Reza's mother undermines Leila's confidence, insisting not only that the couple owes it to the family line to reproduce but that Leila must see that eventually Reza will realize his own need to leave a ""legacy"". Advocating that Reza take another wife, and enlisting the confused and disheartened Leila to assist in convincing him, Reza's mother manipulates everyone, undermining the very foundation of Leila and Reza's marriage. Eventually, caving in (against his will) to the pressure placed on him both by his mother and the reluctant Leila, Reza begins his search for a second wife. It is a bittersweet story and does not herald the triumphant ""love conquers all"" ending that American films would prefer.",1111881600,4,1524,5.124497991967871
1082942,5,6305835322,"Mehrjui manages to convey the intimacy between the couple within the constraints of filming in an Islamic society within the social codes. For example, none of the men and women within the family ever touch each other. Scenes of them cooking, laughing, enjoying each others companionship convey intimacy- but no touching!

 Unfortunately, there are scenes that demand he comfort her (finding out she is sterile), but since they are husband and wife only on film, he cannot offer a comforting hug- making him seem harsh.

 Another not-true-to-life detail,one can relax hijab in one's own home and with family members. The ladies here never do. Covered head to toe even at home by themselves or at family gatherings.

 True to form: the importance of sons. The importance of mothers to their sons.

 A famous hadith: ""O Messenger of Allah! to whom should I show kindness? He replied: Your mother, next your mother, next your mother, and then comes your father...""",1091664000,4,961,5.0
1082943,4,6305835322,"Leila is a tragedy.  In other words, we sense from the onset where this film is going.  And there is nothing at all that will change the outcome -- it is destiny.  So why wonder why Reza can't call a stop or how his mother could be so cruel?  Leila has the answer: it is her fate to be have endless patience; it was written on her forehead from her birth.
Apart from the virtues of the story, I liked the way this movie shows how powerful women are within Iranian culture.  For starters, it is obvious that although Leila's family is well-off, Reza's family is quite wealthy -- such a marriage, to the economic benefit of the woman, would never happen in a culture which doesn't value women.  Also, all the mothers and sisters we see are very opinionated and vocal.  And second marriages are permitted because of the clarity of Muslim mandates on the matter -- the Prophet himself had multiple wives; nevertheless, it is obvious that the Iranian Cosmopolites frown on the practice.  And it may even explain some of this movie if you understand Islamic chain of command: first one must obey God, then one obeys God's messenger, and then one obeys one's mother.
The respect and love between Reza and Leila is touching and beautiful.  They laugh and poke fun at people and make kebab together on their patio, and seem so perfectly united, which makes the foreshadowing even more poignant.
But it is Leila's nature that is the most fascinating part of this movie.  Her humility and warmth when she receives gifts for her birthday, her forebearance with her mother-in-law, her anxiety as she scrubs down her house -- all of it is so real and so tragic.",1084924800,5,1647,4.571428571428571

This is an excellent film.  The human drama is searing, and the nice comic touches go a long way to relieving the unrelenting emotional pressure.
I was mesmerized by the performances, expecially Reza's mother.  What a conniving shrew!  Everyone is perfect.  The direction is fluid and controlled, nuanced when it needs to be, hammer-like when the story calls for it.
Yet, this DVD contains, without a doubt, the WORST film print I have ever seen.  Scratched, marred, muffled audio,....  The contrast ratio is appalling:  all the blacks are crunched: there is no fine detail in the dark areas.  And the whites are practically blooming: way too hot.
The filmmaker obviously used his camera as an artistic tool, and one gets the impression that over half the story - the glimpses into modern Iranian culture - are lost to us simply because the DVD studio got cheap and released a trashy print.
Ever hear of the ORIGINAL NEGATIVE, guys?
Hello!  McFly!!!
Anyway, here's hoping someone will do the right thing and release a good print of this fascinating work.
The more Iranian cinema I watch, the more convinced I am that we are really all alike in the sense that most Iranians are just good people trying to live their lives in modern society, not the extremem fanatics we are constantly being shown on the news.
This movie made me want to go to Iran and befriend these families.  They seems like such interesting people.

1082945,4,6305835322,"Those drawn to Iranian film by the works of Kiarostami, Mahkmalbaf, or Majid Majidi, will definitely find this to be quite different in tone.  More of a standard 'Western' style film, Leila is an upper class (at least compared to the focus on the poor by the previously mentioned directors) and is paced and framed in a way that makes it less of a culture shock for viewers who are used to American films.
The film itself is a powerful representation of cultural repression of women.  I won't go much into the details of the story.  It's fairly straightforward.  A woman who is unable to conceive is convinced by her husband's mother, due to the heavy cultural value of having a male heir, to allow her husband to take a second wife.  The film is essentially a display of Leila's struggle to deal with this situation.
It is a strong film.  I would argue that it is a bit too long, clocking in at just over two hours.  And I personally am fond of the more artsy and esoteric films of Kiarostami, so I wasn't particulaly pleased with the heavy handed melodrama of this film.  But all that aside, it is a good film in its own right.  Just not to my taste.
As for the DVD.  This is a terrible package.  Absolutely terrible.  The print is horrible:  washed out and spotty.  The subtitles are embedded, which isn't a huge problem since most people won't want to shut them off anyway, but they were clearly transferred straight off of the same terrible film print.  They are frequently misspelled and they crack and wash out on certain letters.
Not to mention the suggested retail price, which is insanely high.  Criterion price for Madacy Entertainment quality; which is unforgivable price gouging by First Run Features, taking advantage of the wallets of the fans of rare foreign films.  It's a film worth watching, but the quality of this DVD release is only worthy of a rental.",1082160000,5,1874,4.57957957957958
1082965,4,6305835322,"I happened upon this movie on the sundance channel and couldn't stop watching it.  A lot of people don't understand the middle eastern culture and feel that women are opressed.  This film shows that a husband loves his wife even though she cannot have children.  He does not want to take on a second wife and neither does Leila.  But the old customs of the mother-in-law press Leila, blame Leila and enforce that she force her husband to take a 2nd wife.  The Islamic religion permits a man to take on a 2nd wife, but this husband chooses not to.  This is also an understanding of the middle eastern culture that not all people do take a 2nd wife because they can.  It is a wonderful story of love, fear , pain, and in the end justification.  It is a bit drawn out, but you get involved with Leila, and as an American woman, I could hear myself cry out ""Leila, listen to your husband! Don't worry about your mother-in-law!""  But in reality, the mother-in-law can make life hell for the daughter if she wanted to.  It will make you appreciate your culture a whole lot more and be thankful that you don't have to go through those tribulations like Leila did.",1070150400,4,1156,4.410377358490566
1082966,5,6305835322,"I'm so annoyed that this movie is not more widely known. It is not in most video stores, and has not received the acclaim of many other Iranian films. I have seen about a half dozen films from Iran, most of which I have really liked, and this is by far my favorite. Its plot is not necessarily that original. A young, recently married woman (Leila) is constantly hounded by her mother-in-law, who wants lots of grandkids real quick. It is soon discovered that Leila is unable to bear kids. For the newlyweds, this is no problem, but you can imagine the ire this provokes in the mother-in-law. Indeed, she pressures her son to take a second wife that can bear kids (a perfectly legal practice in Iran). The film follows the newlyweds as they are confronted by these enormous familial pressures. They are both extremely likable characters whose marriage seems based on genuine love and affection, and it is agonizing to watch their relationship slowly disintegrate. I really like how the characters are faced with critical choices at various junctures- they can either choose their own happiness or succumb to the wishes of this truly despicable old woman. At any point, they can tell the mother-in-law to buzz off and let them live in peace, but everybody knows how suffocating family pressures can be. At the end (and it is not a happy ending), it is difficult to decide who is to blame for everything. Our wrath is naturally focused on the mother-in-law, who instigated the whole thing, but we also feel frustration at the newlyweds for letting their truly wonderful relationship fall apart due to the whims of a selfish, uncaring wench. Great performances all around- Leila Hatami wonderfully portrays the title character.",1045872000,8,1724,4.8474576271186445
1082967,5,6305835322,"I don't know why we don't see more movies from the middle east. This movie is about a woman who can not conceive a child and goes through anything possible to do so. However, this is not just about her bearing a child, this is also about the overwhelming pressures of family, and how children especially having a son is very important in Iranian culture. Both the woman and her husband are constantly pressured by both sides of the family for them to conceive. The husband makes it plain that he loves her (his wife) and doesn't wish for children, but with the pressures from his mother and her own- she decides to try to convince him to take another wife.
The emotional roller coaster both couples go through is very dramatic and real. And when the realization hits what was done has truly damaged their relationship- it is apparent that both miserable. However the ending does not leave for despair it gives you a sense of hope.
This movie truly has a lot of morals. 1)If you can not conceive they are other ways to try 2) Do not allow family into your marriage or it can ruin it it 3) Make sure when making a decision you can live with what you just made.
You will find this movie very sensitive and understanding. I was yelling at the television- hoping that right choices would be made. This is a beautiful culture that shows compassion and care. You will enjoy this movie.
The DVD has chapter selections and not really any bonus material. This is a very long movie so be willing to be educated. This movie is also in english subtitles which I absoultely love. So enjoy.",1042761600,6,1575,4.453287197231834
1082968,5,6305835322,"This 1996 Iranian film, which was brought to American audiences in 1999, was written and directed by Dariush Mehrjui who was trained in filmmaking at UCLA and has gone on to produce many outstanding films in his native land.  ""Leila"" is one of them, a drama that raises some very interesting socially conscious questions. In Farsi, with English subtitles, it puts the viewer right into the heart of Teheran. And right into the hearts and minds of Leila and Razi, a young affluent married couple.
There is no doubt that they are in love and their life is a happy one.  They live in a modern, well-furnished house with a huge refrigerator and abundant wonderful food.  They laugh a lot and exchange loving looks.  And declare their love to each other all the time. He's a successful businessman and they get along well with their huge extended families of relatives.  She's a beautiful woman, with huge dark eyes and fine features. Yes, she wears a black chador at all times, but I came to see it as simply the way that women dress in Iran.
Problem is that, in spite of modern medical techniques, Leila remains barren.  Her husband Razi says he doesn't care.  That he loves her just the way she is and doesn't want children.  But then there's her controlling mother-in-law, who starts to bully Leila into accepting a second wife.  In Iranian culture, polygamy is accepted, even though everyone around Leila, with the exception of the mother-in-law, is against this ""second-wife"" idea.
I found myself holding my breath as the pressures on Leila mounted and tensions increased.  I couldn't stop watching as events unfolded.  I felt all the conflicting emotions that Leila felt, as the story grew more and more intense.  The decision was Leila's and she was given free will to make her choice.  Over and over again, this concept of making a conscious choice was emphasized.  That is what made this film great.  I loved it.",1036195200,18,1917,4.7492447129909365

1082971,3,6305835322,"""Leila"" reminds me ""Kadosh"" but unlike the latter, which is full of intentional inaccuracies and outright lies, it is a more sober attempt to look at the predicament of a barren woman in a traditional society. However, if we look at it from this perspective, the film is not effective: there are only one or two characters in this film who are pressing for the supposedly ""traditional"" line, while everybody else does not consider a woman's inability to conceive as anything disastrous. I think that this film is not so much about conflicts with tradition as it is about how people are so often unable to take control of their own lives, about how their little weaknesses lead to situations where things they clearly don't want to happen still happen. This is the real problem, and, to my mind, it could have been treated more seriously here. For example, I found it a bit unrealistic that there was not a single conversation on the topic between the main hero and his mother. Also, I did not understand why if everybody was against the proposed deal, nobody even tried to speak up. Finally, and this is most important, we do not see any ""struggle"" or any ""development"" on the part of Laila, we hear some sentimentally-voiced narrative but nothing else. The question may even be whether she ever loved her husband.. However, despite these drawbacks, I watched the film with interest and I liked very much the parts of it depicting family reunions, with plenty of food and music, warmness and mutual affection.",1026172800,5,1509,4.763358778625954

So many women in the world live under equally humiliating circumstances. The film really shows how Leila rose above the petty people in her life who are trying to manipulate her and in the end outsmarts them all. I first saw this film in Los Angeles in 1999. My motel was in the heart of the Iranian Exile community in West Los Angeles and everyone there seemed to be talking about this film. I went to see it and was hooked. Since then I have seen other Iranian films , most of them from the Shah's time. It is tragic Ayatollah Khomeini was allowed to destroy Iran's once thriving Arts & Entertainment industry. It still exists to some degree in Los Angeles. The fact this film was allowed to be made by the clerical authorities is amazing given it's content. Leila Hatami is a lovely and talented actress who plays her role to perfection.

Reza is a man torn between his love for his wife, and his respect and duty to his family to produce an heir. Reza's mother interferes in his marriage, manipulating Leila into allowing her husband to take a second wife so that he may have a son.
Leila is an incredibly strong woman, with tremendous inner strength and character. Reza is weak, and his mother is manipulative and inconsiderate. The actress playing the mother-in-law is incredibly gifted. This film will make you angry and sad, you will feel heartbreak for Leila and also tremendous respect.

1082974,5,6305835322,"This is an outstanding and compelling film with moving, superlative performances by the cast. The film chronicles the marriage of a young, Iranian couple, Leila and Reza, in modern day Tehran. They are affluent, attractive and very much in love. All is well, until they realize that Leila is barren and unable to bear children. While Leila and Reza appear to have come to terms with this, Reza's mother has not. She begins an almost daily harangue on the issue of her only son taking a second wife, a move which is perfectly legal in Iran.
The mother-in-law does not let up, appealing to Leila's sense of tradition and family obligation. Though Reza insists that he does not care if he has children, he does not stop his mother's constant harangue of Leila. Slowly but surely, Leila's resistance to the idea of a second wife begins to erode, and her mother-in-law ultimately convinces her that Reza must have a child of his blood, and as Leila cannot meet this obligation, a second wife is a must.
The film takes the viewer through the process of the selection of the second wife and Leila's role in that process. One sees the personal devastation that this causes her. One senses Reza's ambivalence about the matter and his reluctance in taking a second wife. Yet, such is the power of love and deft manipulation that both Leila and Reza continue with actions that further this cause, until the moment of truth arrives. The reality is one which is nigh unbearable.
This is an absolutely mesmerizing film. Leila Hatami, as Leila, gives a beautifully moving, well nuanced, award calibre performance. One feels the depth of her distress over this situation, and the viewer's heart breaks for her, as her own heart is breaking. Ali Mossafa is terrific as the ineffectual Reza, who is unable to stand up to his mother.
The love between Leila and Reza is palpable, and it shines throughout the film, even though the two do not physically touch during the film, as it is forbidden for them to do so publicly. Leila is shrouded in traditional style, as are all the women in the film. Yet, interestingly enough, the women are very independent, assertive, and opinionated. It is an iteresting melange of the modern with the traditional.
The film is an eloquent portrayal of the clash between the modern marriage and tradition in a country that is in a state of flux. It is an incisive look at a culture in which a second wife is an option for consideration and at the potential impact of the exercise of such an option.
All in all, this is a fantastic film that opens the window onto another culture, so different to ours in so many ways, yet so alike in others.
