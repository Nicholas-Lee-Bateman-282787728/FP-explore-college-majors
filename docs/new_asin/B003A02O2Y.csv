8507509,2,B003A02O2Y,I'm like horror and sci if so much that worse is good in my eye but trust me this isn't worth even a bad review seriously the movie is terrible I might lend it to a enemy to watch but I doubt it,1370217600,,194,3.5348837209302326
8507510,4,B003A02O2Y,Kind of Texas chainsaw-esq. not bad for a few bucks. Cool with the video in a video angle. I would recommend to those who like obscure Indy-horror films.,1352160000,,153,4.5

2nd film is a rip off of a segment of Dawn of the Dead but on a budget of 5.00$ .
Third film is about a necrophiliac who is having an affair with a mannequin.
Terribly handled. Budget $5.00
This is not a good compendium despite what all the people tell you on here.",1315180800,5,330,3.9402985074626864
8507512,5,B003A02O2Y,"I saw ""Carnage on Graves Farm"" at a film festival in Pasadena a few months ago, and it stood out then as not only one of the best horror films in the festival, but as one of the creepiest indie films I've ever seen. It's shot in a 70s style, with a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" vibe, but the plot could best be described as ""Saw"" on a farm, not because of the violence (there is some good gore, though) but because it has a similar trapped feeling, and a few good twists. The killer is a psycho beekeeper who makes snuff films for money, so there's this really cool movie-within-a-movie effect as they go in and out of the snuff film. Word of warning: it's definitely a hard-R rated film.

I also liked the other two shorts on the DVD. One is a zombie film with no zombies, done in a clever way, which follows three people on the run from a zombie attack. The other is about a crazed high school teacher who terrorizes a female student. Both shorts are good companion pieces for ""Carnage"" because all three films deal with themes of being trapped, and they all have very good acting and a similar style of camerawork.

If you're a fan of indie horror, check it out.",1267401600,12,1162,4.301369863013699
