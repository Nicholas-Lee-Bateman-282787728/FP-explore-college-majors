I wish Universal would do the rest of the Fields movies that weren't released in the first 2 volume collections just like this. I would like to see If I Had A Million, Million Dollar Legs, Mrs. Wiggs Of The Cabbage Patch, Follow The Boys, Song Of The Open Road, and Sensations of 1945.",1380758400,6,442,4.402439024390244

3070349,3,B0011V5O12,"Like others, I purchased this DVD-R, together with ""If I Had a Million"" and ""Mississippi"".  A week ago I was thumbing through some UK sites (AmazonUK) and discovered Universal has released a 17 movie box set of WC Fields.
Included are the 10 already released in the 2 Fields Box sets, plus ""Six of a Kind"", ""Big Broadcast of 1938"" AND RESTORED COPIES OF ""Million Dollar Legs"", ""Follow the Boys"", ""Mississippi"", ""If I Had a Million"" and ""Tillie and Gus"".  Had been selling for 60-odd English Pounds, I bought it for @ $50 AU (about $45 American dollars). I'm stoked!!! Now, there's only ""Mrs Wiggs"", ""Her Majesty Love"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Songs of the Open Road"" and ""Sensations of 1945"" to go. (Fields' bits in ""Tales of Manhattan"" is already out on a Fox DVD).",1252281600,4,766,4.666666666666667
3070350,4,B0011V5O12,"I've not had the pleasure of meeting Greg Horn, who contributed the only other review (so far) of this DVD, but he is clearly a W. C. Fields admirer, and I would second his recommendation of this DVD wholeheartedly.  ""Tillie and Gus"" is often given short shrift by movie critics, but I love it.  It may not be in the same league as ""It's a Gift"" or ""The Bank Dick,"" but it nevertheless offers a virtually nonstop barrage of wonderfully comedic scenes from start to finish.  The scene with Fields on trial in the courtroom, the poker game on the train, the paint-mixing episode, the brief nighttime encounter on the dock between Tillie and Captain Fogg, and the final boat race are all memorable -- superbly paced and acted.  W. C. Fields and Alison Skipworth were a perfect cinematic match, as this movie demonstrates throughout.  They play off each other wonderfully.  There is great character-acting too, from Clarence Wilson (as the crooked lawyer Phineas Pratt) and Edgar Kennedy (briefly, as the trial judge).  Even the pet goose earns his keep!

This DVD does remain an amateur production, and I don't think it's the best we can hope for.  Picture quality is excellent, but I noticed a slight decrease in the audio level as the movie progressed.  Although I found myself periodically increasing the volume on my TV, I thought that perhaps I was imagining a problem that wasn't there -- but when the movie ended and I then started it over again from the beginning, the volume level was uncomfortably high.  It's a flaw I can live with easily, at least until a better transfer (from Universal?) materializes some day.  In the meantime, go for this one.  We Fields fans have been awaiting a ""Tillie and Gus"" on DVD for far too long, and it's great to have this one available, audio flaw notwithstanding.",1204761600,13,1806,4.713375796178344
3070351,3,B0011V5O12,"First off, it's a DVD-R, region 0, it's not a manufacturer's DVD, zero extra's, reasonably cheap CD case photo.  My rating of 3 star is due to this alone and not the quality of the movie or transfer which are both very good.

That being said and out of the way I'm thrilled to see a good transfer of Tillie And Gus on DVD finally. I have a copy I made off digital cable a few years back with an S-VHS tape recorder and although that copy is very good, this DVD is much better. Not sure what their source material was but the picture is very clear, sound is very good too. Pausing the opening titles shows no artifacts around the titles edges which a low quality copy will always have.

Moving on to the movie itself, this is yet another rarely seen Fields movie that is very, very good. W.C.'s scene of mixing paint is a must see, it's classic Field's. This DVD seller also has Field's Mississippi and If I Had A Million on DVD.

Hopefully Universal or whoever has the rights to the official release of the yet to be released to DVD Field's movies will get Mississippi, Tillie and Gus, Million Dollar Legs, & Her Majesty Love all out soon on a third Field's collection as well as the following bit part Field's movies: Tales Of Manhattan, Alice In Wonderland (1933) Song Of The Open Road, Mrs. Wiggs Of The Cabbage Patch, Sensations Of 1945, Follow The Boys as well as the silents The Old Army Game, Running Wild & Sally Of The Sawdust(uncut please, I have it uncut on tape it should be 124 minutes, NOT 113,110, or 92 minutes as most tapes/DVD's are).

Overall yet another great Field's movie that I can heartily recommend for your viewing pleasure.",1199491200,30,1650,4.39672131147541

8242749,4,B0011V5O12,"I had not seen Tillie and Gus for nearly fifty years.  Most people under forty only know W.C. Fields from posters and have never seen him in action.  He was perhaps the funniest man who ever lived and there is none of his work I would not recommend.  Like Laurel & Hardy, you cannot just listen to the film, you have to watch carefully to catch all the sight gags and bits of slapstick that appear out of nowhere and have nothing to do with what is happening.  His collaboration with Allison Skipworth covers several films and they compliment each other well.  as in other W.C. Fields films, Baby Leroy serves to drive the plot.  If you like films from the thirties, try this one.",1449273600,,680,4.4
8242750,5,B0011V5O12,Loved it,1448755200,,8,3.5
8242751,5,B0011V5O12,"I was a little skeptical at first since this isn't a professional studio release, but rather a DVD-R burn by an independent.  Well, it's obvious that they know their stuff because the print used was excellent and whatever cleanup they did made it better.  The sound was a little marginal, but that's the norm for 1933.

The five stars is mostly for the value on this disc.  The movie would have gotten that many regardless. My favorite bit was the ""mixing paint"" scene where he's trying to keep up with a ""Home Improvement"" type radio show belting out instructions faster and faster.",1443398400,,583,4.686274509803922
8242752,5,B0011V5O12,"This  photo of Ann Blyth is NOT from W. C. Fields film ""Tillie and Gus""!",1426723200,,72,3.8
8242753,4,B0011V5O12,"If we think that the golden age of Hollywood was all originality and daring we should remember that then like as now, a hit caused a rush of imitations. In this case, there was ANNA CHRISTIE (1930) which led to MIN AND BILL both of which were huge hits that made having Marie Dressler and an old drunk on a tugboat inexplicably popular; the idea of an older drunken scoundrel couple playing guardian angel to some young put-upon family (or mission) became a staple. Paramount wanted in, so decided to shoehorn W.C. Fields in as the Beery character and get their version of Dressler, Alison Skipworth - and cast them as estranged married couple of hustlers who play guardian angel to a cute young couple (that includes BLACK CAT star Jacqueline Welles and Baby Leroy as ""King"")

Before it settles into a trite ""Ill pay the rent"" kind of melodramatic satire involving an anything goes ferryboat race to win a ferry franchise, with Fields cheating right and left while making the stupidest decisions at the same time, there's a lengthy enjoyable stretch with Fields representing himself at a trial in Alaska for cheating at cards and shooting the guy he cheated, as he laid down five aces in one hand ""and besides, I know what I dealt 'im""

From there it all goes a little down hill - the script demands everyone behave super stupidly (why Welles and her husband don't hire their own lawyer and sue Phineas for conflict of interest is a mystery the script writer is not up to answering). So instead of more cool scenes of cheating at cards, we get Fields trying to mix his own paint via a radio show how-to (a lengthy tired scene more in line with Laurel and Hardy than our favorite rogue-charlatan-alcoholic-juggler)
And the usual American hokum. Nonetheless... essential for Fields fans and Skipworth makes a surprisingly adept compatriot for old W.C.

The DVD-R from Universal Vault is pretty gorgeous to see, nonetheless only committed Fieldsians (like myself) should commit, since it's the same approx. price as either of the five film sets from Universal. It's 59 minutes long with no extras. I would get the two 5 film Fields sets first (or one big set combining all ten films), and then MILLION DOLLAR LEGS from the TCM vault collection... and Then MISSISSIPPI, and then go for this, and you'll be sitting pretty with nearly everything the old boy made (not counting silents and shorts)",1411084800,2,2391,4.756626506024096

8242755,4,B0011V5O12,"This Fields classic shows the viewer how the curmugeonly Field's gets us to see all his trademark traits - drinking, cheating, etc.  We see all his faults, and we still cheer him on.",1407974400,,182,4.515151515151516
