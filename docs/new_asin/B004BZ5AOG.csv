4321142,4,B004BZ5AOG,"Pretend for a moment you recently arrived on this planet with no awareness of politics, just a keen interest in American cinema. Acquainting yourself with the classics and thus becoming familiar with the finest actors of the golden era-- Bogart, Grant, Gable, Stewart, Wayne, Tracy, Cooper and Cagney-- your curiosity compels you to dig a little deeper, gaining appreciation for the likes of (Williams) Powell and Holden, Robert Mitchum, Edward G. Robinson, Kirk (and Melvyn) Douglas, Errol Flynn, Fredric March, Burt Lancaster, Gregory Peck, etc. Then someone hands you a copy of the Ronald Reagan Centennial Collection. After watching the eight films (each on its own disc) included in the set, you wonder, 'What happened to that guy? He was really good.' Though his body of work is comparatively slight, there's no question he has that same star quality attributed to his more famous Hollywood contemporaries: he doesn't seem to be acting; his characters embody his own character, and he is formidable, believable and sympathetic by degrees with charm to spare. You want to see more. Well, Reagan's career, of course, made history on a different level, but I'm confident that had fortune zigged instead of zagged for him, his talent would have earned him a spot on that second rung of big-letter marquis names. There are four great dramas here ('Dark Victory,' 'King's Row,' 'The Hasty Heart' and 'Storm Warning'), two sappy-but-entertaining sports biopics ('Knute Rockne, All American' and 'The Winning Team'), an action-packed WWII adventure ('Desperate Journey,' which also appears on an excellent Flynn set) and a fair flag-flying wartime musical ('This Is the Army'-- the biggest grossing film of 1943). Reagan plays parts ranging from throwaway supporting roles to co-star to lead, all with style and poise, hitting a note somewhere between Jimmy Stewart's goofy nice guy and Gary Cooper's quiet hero. Prints are in decent shape across the board ('Army,' the lone color production, being the shakiest) with a couple insightful commentaries (I was particularly absorbed by that on 'Hasty Heart') and other, more superfluous extras. So, if you will, put aside your political passions for a day, and consider this Reagan collection on its own merits. Content combined earns 4-minus stars; attractively packaged presentation, 4-plus.",1395532800,12,2338,5.321621621621621
4321143,3,B004BZ5AOG,"I was interested in what kind of actor Ronald Reagan was and I have to say he really wasn't too bad.  A much better president, though!!",1387324800,3,135,4.1923076923076925
4321144,5,B004BZ5AOG,"""Ronald Reagan: Centennial Collection"" (2011) is the most complete collection yet of Reagan's movies, but 2 more should be added.

His very first movie, in which he had only a tiny part as a radio interviewer trying to get time with a Hollywood movie star (and failing), was ""Hollywood Hotel"" (1937) starring Dick Powell, which movie was famous for the signature song ""Hooray For Hollywood.""

Reagan came to Hollywood in the middle 1930's after a short career as a radio announcer and sports broadcaster in Iowa after his graduation in 1932 from Eureka College in Illinois.

Radio was just coming into its own in the middle 1930's and was very intersting as a subject to movie audiences. People wanted to see what radio was about ""behind the scenes.""  Many late 1930's Hollywood movies showed that, and sold a lot of tickets because of it.

Many ""radio"" movies were made in the late 1930's.  Bob Hope's signature song title ""Thanks For The Memory"" was from a radio movie titled ""The Big Broadcast Of 1938"" and Hope himself became a Hollywood star only after he achieved radio stardom in the late 1930's.

Ronald Reagan was a former radio pro who got beginning actor work because of his radio experience.  He could be useful for ""radio movies,"" and was hired.

Hollywood film studios made many movies about the then glamourous radio business and the world of radio celebrities.

Reagan was a handsome, articulate young man who had studied dramatics in college (he majored in Sociology but participated in many school plays in lead roles), and actually had experience as a radio broadcaster.

The latter credential got him a contract with Warner Brothers, and his first role in ""Hollywood Hotel"" (1937) showed Reagan doing what he had done in Iowa....radio interviewing.  His radio interview experience got him ""in the door"" to the world of Hollywood acting for big studios.

His ""Hollywood Hotel"" (1937) role (uncredited but important for any interested in his movie actor career) is important to include in any history of Reagan's movie actor work.

Reagan also starred in a movie re-make of one of Broadway's longest running plays, ""The Voice Of The Turtle,"" (1947) which was a good movie well done, and re-released at a later time with the title ""One For The Book.""

Re-makes of important Broadway plays were often done in Hollywood over it's history, and most of the resulting movie were good...took advantage of good material easy to turn into a good movie.

""The Voice Of The Turtle"" (1947) starring Ronald Reagan is an example of this, and should be included in any collection showing important movie work he did.

Voice Of The Turtle (1947) is a very well presented movie with great actor work from stars Ronald Reagan and Eleanor Parker, assisted by Eve Arden, three talented movie stars of the middle 20th Century.

The movie is especially interesting and worthwhile because it showcases one of the biggest Broadway (NYC NY USA) stage hits of the middle 1940's, written by John Van Druten....the show played on the Broadway stage non-stop from 1943 through 1947.....5 years.

One of those stage play titles one sees when ""Longest Running Plays Ever Produced"" lists are provided in stage play history books.

Most of the show takes place in a single one bedroom apt. (the romantic female lead's NYC upper East Side Manhattan digs) with half a dozen departures for short periods to NYC places young, handsome singles of those 1940's times were part of....

chic French restaurants where meals started with Vichisois (cold Leek Soup) and ended with Crepe Suzettes (ultra thin pancakes doused with Grand Marnier orange flavored brandy made up and served table-side by a tuxedoed waiter with a charming smile and foreign accent).....

empty theater stages where new plays auditioned new hopeful actresses...

NYC elegant night clubs with live orchestras and well dressed, mannerly patrons, all good dancers....

The whole show is worth seeing for many reasons, but one is that an entire culture and way of life now long gone, and with it civility, manners, etiquette, and genuine social charm.....is depicted for all to see, marvel at, and lament the passing of.

A well done 2004 video documentary titled Broadway The Golden Age interviews NYC actors of fame who worked during the 1940's through the 1970's and recalled how it all went, what it all was about, and most especially decried the fact what they had all be part of was now (in 2004 and after) gone forever, and not replaced by better performing art and memorable, human stagecraft.

Voice Of The Turtle (1947) shows in movie form what the stage-play presented to theater goers (I write this in 2012, and if a 20 year old attended the first 1943 presentations in NYC of this show, he or she would be 88 this year!).

I join many others in cheering this wonderful and forgotten play and movie, worth getting, worth seeing.

4321145,5,B004BZ5AOG,"For the centennial of our greatest President, Warner Bros. has put together a collection of eight of Ronald Reagan's finest films, as follows:

1) DARK VICTORY - More of a Bette Davis film than a Reagan film, but very good drama nonetheless.

2) KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-AMERICAN - Pat O'Brien plays the Notre Dame coach and title character; Reagan plays his bedridden star player, George Gipp (that's where ""the Gipper"" nickname came from).

3) KINGS ROW - Considered Reagan's finest role, and many believe it should have gotten Oscar consideration, but YANKEE DOODLE DANDY was made the same year, and WB submitted that one instead (probably wisely, as Reagan himself admitted).

4) DESPERATE JOURNEY - A fine World War II drama, with Errol Flynn.

5) THIS IS THE ARMY - Finally, an official DVD release of this great patriotic musical!

6) THE HASTY HEART - a decent, though not spectacular film, with Patricia Neal.

7) STORM WARNING - A courtroom drama in which Reagan, Ginger Rogers, and Doris Day battle the KKK in a murder case.

8) THE WINNING TEAM - A delightful film in which Reagan plays the Hall of Fame pitcher, Grover Cleveland Alexander.

A fine collection that is well worth owning.",1311379200,5,1191,4.827586206896552

SYNOPSIS:
Honoring our 40th American President's 100th birthday, Warner Home Video presents the Ronald Reagan Centennial Collection, featuring eight outstanding film performances from the prolific actor and long time Warner Bros. contract player.

The Ronald Reagan Centennial Collection is more than a DVD collection; it's a tribute to one of the most beloved figures in cinematic and American history and one that fans of Mr. Reagan's films will surely treasure for years to come.

Dark Victory (1939)
A young socialite is diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and must decide whether she'll meet her final days with dignity. Bette Davis enjoyed one of her signature roles as a spoiled socialite facing terminal illness - with friend Reagan among those helping her toward a last chance to give her life meaning.

BONUS FEATURES:

  * Commentary by historian James Ursini and CNN film critic Paul Clinton
  * Tough Competition for Dark Victory Featurette

Knute Rockne All-American (1940)
""I've decided to take up coaching as my life work,"" Knute Rockne says. Coach he does, revolutionizing football with his strategies, winning close to 90 percent of his games, and helping establish the University of Notre Dame's ""Fighting Irish"" as a gridiron powerhouse. But victories alone do not mean success to Rockne. He wants to shape his players into responsible and honorable men.

This famed sports biopic combines a passion for the game (and footage of actual Notre Dame contests) with two superb performances: Pat O'Brien in the title role and Ronald Reagan as George Gipp, the gifted but doomed halfback whose deathbed plea to ""win one for the Gipper"" remains one of cinema's most memorable quotes. And for the rest of his life, Reagan would often be called the Gipper.

  * Classic cartoon Porky's Baseball Broadcast

Kings Row (1942)
It's a quaint turn-of-the-century small town with shady streets, swimming holes and the clip-clop of horse and buggy. But that peaceful exterior conceals human lives twisted by cruelty, murder and madness. Kings Row is one of Warner Bros.' most distinguished productions, highlighted by an outstanding cast, haunting James Wong Howe cinematography and a somber, emotion-laden Erich Wolfgang Korngold score.
""Oomph Girl"" Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, Betty Field, Claude Rains and Charles Coburn give indelible performances - and Ronald Reagan's portrayal of Drake, a cheerful ne'er-do-well shattered by tragedy, has been hailed as a career high. Nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Picture, Kings Row is a powerful American saga of dreams, despair and triumph.

  * Classic cartoon Fox Pop
  * Theatrical trailer

Desperate Journey (1942)

The Hasty Heart (1949)
Monsoons drench them. The sun scorches them. Still, the Allies fight doggedly through Burma in 1945. For easygoing Yank (Ronald Reagan) and hard-headed Lachie (Richard Todd), the road to victory ends at a jungle hospital. With the help of a devoted nurse (Patricia Neal), they face a new battle called recovery.

The Hasty Heart playwright John Patrick drew from his own wartime service in a British ambulance unit. Vincent Sherman (The Hard Way, Mr. Skeffington) directs this sensitive adaptation sparked by the performance that ranks with Kings Row as among Reagan's best. The future President wasn't the only one to draw accolades. Todd won a 1949 Best Actor Oscar nomination and a Most Promising Newcomer Golden Globe Award as the valorous, wounded Scotsman who doesn't know that his new fight is his last.

BONUS FEATURES:

  * Vintage Joe McDoakes comedy short So You Want to Be in Pictures
  * Classic Cartoon: The Hasty Hare

Storm Warning (1951)
A mob in hooded white robes. A man running for his life. Gunfire. In the South to visit her sister Lucy, Marsha Mitchell witnesses a Ku Klux Klan murder. Once safely with Lucy, Marsha relays the terror she has seen...then recognizes her sister's brutish new husband as one of the killers. She could lie, protect her sister and leave town. Or she could be the one person brave enough to bring the Klan to justice.

Ginger Rogers and Doris Day as the sisters, Steve Cochran as the husband and Ronald Reagan as a crusading D.A. give some of their finest performances in this explosive indictment of a hate that poisoned America from within. Part thriller, part expos, part stirring human drama, Storm Warning is ""feverish...engrossing"" (Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide) - and moviemaking at its most powerful.

BONUS FEATURE:

  * Theatrical Trailer

The Winning Team (1952)
He was Hollywood's ideal of the boy next door. She was America's Sweetheart. Ronald Reagan and Doris Day headline this film about our national pastime. In The Winning Team Reagan is Grover Cleveland Alexander, the Hall of Fame pitcher whose baseball victories paralleled triumphs in his personal life. Suffering from double vision and fainting spells, Alexander sees his career bottom out. But, helped by his wife (Day), he makes a successful return that reaches its peak in the 1926 Yankees/Cardinals World Series. Real-life major leaguers Bob Lemon, Peanuts Lowrey, Hank Sauer, Gene Mauch and more appear in this story of the legendary pitcher.
