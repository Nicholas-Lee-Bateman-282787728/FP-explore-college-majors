5109317,5,B007RR3N3K,Love this show !! Have been watching it since season 1 . I kept looking for it and finally found it I'm so happy !! Great show,1342483200,3,126,3.7037037037037037
5109318,3,B007RR3N3K,"The story ends as a fairy tale. Wasn't what I excepted. Disappointing since the series started out with regrets and the great ""what if"".
Totally off the rocker was Erica being in between two men and actually dumping one and reconciling with the other on one evening.
As if a woman can't be successful without a man. Poor message to women.",1433980800,,338,4.557377049180328

5109320,5,B007RR3N3K,"This is a great Canadian show that I started watching when it was on the now-defunct SOAPNet in the US. They stopped airing the show before season 4 had aired here and I was dying to know how everything would end! I was thrilled when I found I could order the final season on Amazon. I wasn't sure if the DVDs would be compatible with American DVD players (I have limited technical knowledge but I know there are various ""regions"" internationally when it comes to electronics and you have to be careful to buy products that are compatible with your ""region"") and thankfully they are.

As for the show itself, I found it to be so refreshing from American television shows - less cynical but at the same time more progressive than what we have in the states. There were a few situations and plot points that I feel would either not be featured on primetime network shows in America or a very big deal would be made about it in the media. Erica, the main character, is very relatable and the supporting characters are interesting in their own right. Erica's relationships and experiences with these people were portrayed in a realistic and engaging way from episode 1. The time traveling premise is a great basis for a show if you don't question how it works too much. While the fourth season wrapped everything up nicely and before the whole thing wore out its welcome, I was sad the show was over! I'd heard an American version was in the works a couple of years ago but unfortunately haven't heard anything else about that since then.",1427587200,,1534,4.557971014492754

5109323,5,B007RR3N3K,The wait is over.  I waited so long to finally see the final season of Being Erica.  It was worth the wait.,1420243200,,107,3.8181818181818183
5109324,5,B007RR3N3K,The DVD arrived and I'm very happy with delivery time and quality.,1413590400,,66,4.583333333333333

5109328,5,B007RR3N3K,"A great show. I guess this is the last season, which is a shame. I't would be perfect if the format had closed captions",1404518400,,119,4.0
5109329,5,B007RR3N3K,"Being Erica's: Season 4 shows did not disappoint. The shows totally wrapped up past questions and the characters that I so dearly loved progressed through the episodes in a logical fashion. It is too bad that the show ended with season 4. Perhaps fans would love a 2 hour movie to see how the characters evolve in the future. Does Erica marry, does Dr. Tom remain blissfully happy with life without powers, does Erica's mom find another man, does the publishing company become a powerhouse, does her business partner (Julianne) finally marry Brent, does her sister finally get the man of her dreams to marry her and what about Erica's dad? Will Dr Tom's daughter finally become clean and sober? It would be brilliant to explore these questions and give fans another peak into Erica's world.",1398902400,,790,4.8161764705882355
5109330,5,B007RR3N3K,I would recommend this to anyone.  I hated to see it end.  It never aired in the U.S. but in Canada.  Great series.,1395964800,,115,3.9130434782608696
5109331,5,B007RR3N3K,"This was a great ending to a great show, I just wish there would have been a few more episodes.",1394755200,,95,3.8
5109332,5,B007RR3N3K,"It's rare for a show to end because the folks in charge have comfortably asserted they have no more stories to tell. That is the case for Being Erica, however, and going into the last season with an understanding of that intentional finality definitely helps salve the frustration that comes with it being over. Interesting changes are brought into this season, and it does a good job of wrapping up lingering storylines, introducing some new ideas, and providing a comforting sense of--not fate--but meaning influencing the lives of these characters even after they're off screen.",1390953600,,581,5.126315789473685
5109333,5,B007RR3N3K,Living in the United States I was so sad when they didn't show the last Season if Being Erica on Soapnet. I fell in love with this show from the very first episode. I was so excited and not at all disappointed by the last season of the show. I as well as many other fan wish that it didn't have to end. I always found myself wishing that I could be apart if that world of therapy. Everyone lives with regrets and wishes they could do something to change them. The writers for this show were amazing and have exceptional imaginations that create a show I will truly always treasure.,1384646400,3,581,4.243243243243243
5109334,5,B007RR3N3K,"I fell in love with this series season 1 tru 3, but the network I was wachling it on was cancelled. I checked video places around my town but no one knew of this series, or had it. Thank You Amazon for given me a chance to finish with a very good series.!

Young girl (Erica) going through difficulties has a near death experience. She is teamed up with this therapist/ Doctor Tom, whom is not your regular therapitst, and that's when her universe changes! She has the oppurnity to go back into time and ""fix"" her life's biggest regrets on her regrets list. Really great series to get into,",1383264000,,590,4.363636363636363

5109336,4,B007RR3N3K,"We liked the show and bought this one since this season wasn't available online for free, but we felt that the series ended rather abruptly.  We expected to have more episodes on the last DVD, but it was mostly filled with extras that we haven't watched yet.",1381449600,,258,4.48936170212766
5109337,5,B007RR3N3K,I was so excited to get this boxed set since they didn't show season 4 in the U.S. Worth every penny!,1378598400,,101,3.857142857142857
5109338,5,B007RR3N3K,"Glad I bought season 4. I loved the first three seasons when I watched on Hulu and was dying to know how it ended. I will say I thought some of the story lines in this season were a bit off and Erica became a little less likable or relatable, but overall glad to see more of the show and really wish it wasn't over!",1377388800,,315,3.8615384615384616
5109339,5,B007RR3N3K,I just love Being Erica and hope they continue the show.  It's one of my favorites and was so glad to get the DVDs.,1377302400,,115,3.7916666666666665

5109342,5,B007RR3N3K,I have always enjoyed watching Being Erica from season 1 to season 4.. Great story lines about true life and situations people go through..,1374710400,,139,4.833333333333333
5109343,5,B007RR3N3K,"I watched all the Being Erica seasons in the US via the soapnet channel, but when ABC family bought them out, they didn't air the last season of the show, which I believe was a bit rude.  Because of that, I was 'forced' to buy it because I couldn't seem to stream or download it anywhere (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu), but I am not regretting my purchase.  I agree now with the authors that this was the best way to end the show.  I will be sad, but hey! now I can watch it any time!  Also, I heard a rumor they might create a US version of this Canadian show...that might be interesting.",1374537600,2,582,4.123893805309734
5109344,5,B007RR3N3K,"I honestly don't remember how I stumbled upon this Canadian series a few years ago, but if I were still in grad school I'd be writing a scholarly paper comparing this series and the American film (starring Jennifer Garner) ""13 Going on 30"" as examples of what contemporary women of a certain age *really* want, which is a youthful do-over.

Erica Strange is a smart and attractive 30-ish Toronto ne'er-do-well who finds a supernatural therapist at a crisis point in her life. Under his guidance, she is able to replay various turning points in her past, most of which result in small, not seismic, shifts to her present life. The bittersweet aspect of Erica's time-travel is key; she (and we) learn uncomfortable truths about her parents and long-sacred family myths, and everything she ""changes"" in her past ends up being just a slight variation of what has already happened. Still, there is enough tension between what was and what could have been to make each episode interesting; once you buy into the conceit of time-travel, the ""rules"" of Erica's world make sense, and you are invested in how she is going to create a spectacular life for herself, despite her sometimes maddening self-sabotage. The series rings true for single gals of a wide age spectrum, and this reviewer shed tears at the finale both because it was masterfully done, and I no longer had Erica Strange as a compass for how to operate in the world as a sassy spinster.

""Being Erica"" is a wonderful series that really has no flaws; I wish it had gone on longer than four seasons. Funny, sweet, devastating, and true--it is *more* than worth a look.",1370131200,12,1623,4.75177304964539
5109345,5,B007RR3N3K,"Being Erica is wonderful. I first discovered it on soapnet. They did not renew the license for season 4 so I never got to see how the show ended. I tried to watch season 4 on you tube,but the season was removed. I am so glad that it is for sale on amazon. I can finally see how the show ended and also watch the other 3 seasons at my leisure and relive them all over again. I can't wait to get the 4 seasons.",1367280000,5,408,3.8117647058823527
5109346,5,B007RR3N3K,"I found Being Erica on Hulu in the US, and it was wonderful. Season 4 never was licensed to the US market, so I bought this set to see how it ended.

Worth. Every. Penny.

DVDs arrived quickly, no problems with anything. The other (cheaper) listing for a different region/format had comments about poor video quality, but I had NO problems with this one.",1363305600,2,354,4.515625

8521511,5,B007RR3N3K,"I LOVED season 1-3 then I never saw it again on Soapnet. I thought it was over until I saw season 4 on Amazon. Last night I was looking for season 5, but then I read a review enlightening me that season 4 was THE END. I admit, I cried for 45 minutes watching the very last episode this morning, (I NEVER, EVER cry, EVER)! It was a great ending to such a wonderful series. If you've seen any of the seasons before, this last one does not disappoint. My only wish is that it lasted longer because it was so good.",1443312000,,510,4.009803921568627

The story lines are captivating, the acting is superb, the cast has perfect chemistry, and my only disappointment is that it was all over too soon. This particular season was so rich and they did a fantastic job of satisfactorily addressing every key character's story. I was left feeling hopeful and knowing that, while the series was complete, nothing was left hanging uncomfortably. Bravo, CBC!",1437523200,,452,5.04
