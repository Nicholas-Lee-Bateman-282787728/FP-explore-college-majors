1980377,4,B000197134,"I bought this movie for my wife who had stated a while before that she used to rent it from the library all the time.  She said she preferred it because of Melissa Gilbert's performance as Helen Keller, even though she was too old for the part at the time.  I thought it would make a good birthday gift since she hadn't seen it in a while.  I decided to watch it with her, open-minded, but not expecting much.  I, too, was very impressed with Melissa Gilbert's portrayal.  The movie captured the struggle between Ms. Sullivan and Helen Keller and Ms. Sullivan's own struggle very well.  I wouldn't say it's a new favorite, but it was worth the mention.",1231286400,,652,4.436974789915967
1980378,2,B000197134,"Received a copy of the movie which I was not informed of prior to purchasing. Was expecting an original.

A 14yr old Melissa unbelieveable as a 6 yr old but a great movie nonetheless.

Almost identical dialogue as the 1962 version and Patty as Annie steals the show. She makes an excellent Helen AND Annie.",1223596800,,306,4.545454545454546
1980379,4,B000197134,"In short...I too have seen this 1979 ""Made-For-Television"" classic.  Funny though, by 1979, I had only seen the original '61 Bancroft/Duke classic, just bits & pieces, a time or two.  So the storyline, plot, theme & ""modern"" production of the newer Duke/Gilbert version, really struck a chord within me...like many, in that time, I trust.  Nothing can take the place of that art filmish-like masterpiece from writer William Gibson & director Arthur Penn, but Duke having such a pivotal role in BOTH films...helps make this re-make a ""modern-day"" classic as well.  The only BIG problem?  As of late 2007...a day when those are moving into movie-downloads and viewing them on portable, miniature camera/phone micro-devices...still NO DVD ever released...and still, no plan to...at this time.  And for that reason...and that reason only...I leave you with only 4 Stars my film-friend.  But THAT, of course, is not ""your"" fault...!",1195776000,5,927,5.26530612244898
1980380,5,B000197134,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. When I was a teenager I watched it every weekend. It was one of the movies that helped me decide to become a special ed teachers. Though Melissa Gilbert, who was about 14 when she made the film, was a little old and tall to be playing 6 year old Helen Keller, it is still such a moving and beautiful movie that it is a classic.",1189814400,2,367,3.972972972972973
1980381,4,B000197134,"I teach this play so I have seen both this version and the 1962 version many times.  I must say that I think the ""62 version is better in many respects.  The performances of the leads in that version truly set the mark for this play and probably couldn't be equaled by anyone else.  In the remake, the performances are not quite as good although they are certainly first class performers doing excellent work.  What makes this verion better for classroom use, is the color photography and the settings.  Those not used to black and white, as my students are not, tend to find the '62 version slightly depressing.  I remember when this verion was first televised the marketing factor was Patty Duke and the role reversal for this version.  She is an excellent actress and is very good as Annie. The actors playing Mrs. Keller and James are also good, but I find the actor playing Captain Keller far less forceful than Victor Jory in the ""62 version.  I haven't seen the most recent version so I can't say how that compares to either.  I wish this would come out on DVD, my VHS copy won't live much longer!",1082592000,7,1104,4.48
1980424,2,B000197134,"I chose the wrong Miracle Worker movie - not the Annie Sullivan (Anne Bancroft) film expected - history elements certainly correct, however odd colorization, awkward voices, acting very irregular, reception was scant, volume was up & down.",1495324800,,239,5.486486486486487
1980425,5,B000197134,"As usual this was a great movie based on the life of Helen Keller. I had seen it previously, but I thought I was choosing the one with Ann Bancroft as Ms Sullivan, the teacher and Patty Duke as Helen Keller. As it turned out, that was an older version, I believe. But Patty Duke still performed well in this rendition as Ms Sullivan.",1494288000,,333,4.21875

1980430,4,B000197134,You can't go wrong with Patti Duke and Melissa Gilbert! This is a beautiful movie about the life of the great Hellen Keller.  It is truly inspirational to watch Duke play Annie Sullivan after she played Helen as a child.  Gilbert does a great job playing a difficult role.  A star was lost as the streaming was very pixilated and blurry at times.,1486857600,,346,4.4603174603174605

1980466,5,B000197134,"This version of the Helen Keller/Anne Sullivan story is, by far, my favorite.  Melissa Gilbert's performance, IMHO, is hard to beat.  I really enjoyed Patty Duke in this one as well.  I felt she made a convincing Anne Sullivan.  Not all of the actors are as good, but the movie keeps your attention. I shared it with an 18 year old young lady recently.  She had done some research on Helen Keller, but had never seen this movie.

1980743,5,B000197134,"We've watched all of the movies we can find about Helen Keller (even the critically-dissed TV special), and it was a treat to watch Patty Duke, who played Helen in the original, Academy-award-winning Miracle Worker, also play Ann Sullivan in this version (she'd said years ago she hoped to play the part of Ann). And of course, it was something seeing Mellisa Gilbert, of Little House on the Prairie, play Helen. I'm not sure she was best for the role. Still--Helen's story is so amazing, and I like seeing Patty Duke take on the new role. It's not an award-winner but it's certainly worth watching. Seeing life from Helen's eyes (well--not quite, I suppose; she was blind) is very educational; and reminds us of how fortunate we are--and of the amazing obstacles some people have overcome.",1409356800,5,790,4.8161764705882355
1980744,5,B000197134,"It has been so educational sharing the movies and story of Helen Keller with my 8 yr old grand daughter over this past summer.

My grand daughter had actually learned her story in the second grade.  By watching all three movies, she could appreciate the different actors and compare the story from one to the other.  It was good to see the story was the same with just a few changes because of the actors.  But the story was the same, and Helen Keller was a fighter.

Because Helen Keller's life was near impossible to live and progress, just seeing the human determination in her, and because she was so fortunate to have Ann Sullivan as her teacher...she thrived and grew and developed into a very accomplished and educated woman.  For all those years  passed in the late 1800's and early 1900's...it makes a person think how much determination she had.

Patty Duke now playing the part of Ann Sullivan was entertaining and it is obvious she too was inspired by the story.

The story of Helen Keller needs to continue to be read or watched by all.  It continues to inspire and help us realize just how great life is and how much we take for granite.  Adults need to refresh their memories of the story and act accordingly.

I am hoping my grand daughter will stay inspired by this story and some day write her own report on Helen Keller in a future grade in school.",1408579200,2,1367,4.467741935483871

It is very well done, and the students enjoyed watching it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that Melissa Gibson was really too old to be playing the part.

a story about the handicapped. And it all worked out! Helen graduated from Radcliffe in 1904.

1980979,4,B000197134,"In her 1987 autobiography ""Call Me Anna,"" Patty Duke writes that, while portraying Helen Keller in the original Broadway production  of ""The Miracle Worker"", she dreamed of playing the role of Helen's determined teacher Annie Sullivan. Seventeen years after she won an Academy Award as Helen opposite Anne Bancroft as Annie in Arthur Penn's brilliant 1962 film version, her dream of playing Annie  finally came true. This is the rare TV production that nearly equals the power of the original; in large part due to Duke's extraordinary, intense performance. Melissa Gilbert, then the 14 year old star of the TV series ""Little House On The Prarie"", has a more difficult time as blind and deaf Helen Keller. Gilbert's performance is certainly admirable. It just misses, by a small margin, the ferocious quality the role of Helen requires.
  Duke writes, ""As you can imagine, everything about doing that play the second time around carried a terrific emotional charge for me...the years of wishing to play it, wishing to have that stature, the years of screwing up my life, and then this great gift, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, this moment of forgiveness for my transgressions. I thought I would die."" Her dream role of Annie Sullivan resulted in an extremely well deserved Emmy Award; the perfect compliment to the Academy Award she received for her earlier performance as Helen. ""I have to confess,"" Duke writes, ""the Emmy I won for ""The Miracle Worker"" is my favorite acting honor.
  In the original film, Inga Swenson and Victor Jory give overwrought performances as Helen's parents. Diana Muldair and Charles Seibert are more solid in this version. In contrast to Helen's parents, Annie does not feel any pity for Helen. ""Pity? For this tyrant? The whole house turns on her whims,"" she says. ""Is there anything she wants she doesn't get?...I pity that the sun won't rise and set for her every morning and you're telling her it will."" Instead of pity, Annie recognizes Helen's hidden human potential and does not see her as impaired or ""disabled"" in any way. When Helen's mother asks if it is possible to teach an ""impaired"" child, Annie replies, ""Oh, there's nothing impaired in that head. It works like a mouse-trap."" During a later, heated exchange with Helen's father, Annie declares, ""I treat her as a sighted child because I ask her to see... I expect her to see!"" Indeed, Annie asks Helen to reach beyond any perceived limitations.
  This worthwhile TV production does have a few flaws, which Patty Duke objectively acknowledged: ""it's inescapable that {the TV production] wasn't as powerful as [the original film version]...the choreography of the production was in general lacking in intensity,"" she writes. The TV production also loses some dramatic intensity because it is in color, and ""The Miracle Worker"" is much better suited to black and white; like the original 1962 film. Still,  there's plenty of  emotional power in William Gibson's strong script, and when the battle of wills between Annie and Helen finally results in an amazing triumph, there won't be a dry eye in the audience.",1239408000,36,3117,4.954022988505747
1980980,4,B000197134,"The Miracle Worker with Melissa Gilbert was a good rendition of the story, but I prefer the other two versions to this one. Melissa Gilbert was greatly overshadowed by Patty Duke as Ann Sullivan, and she was really too old to be playing the part. All three versions were pretty much identical, except for the individuals playing the parts. In my opinion, the Miracle worker with Hallie Eisenberg was the best of the three. If you are interested in it because of Melissa Gilbert, don't expect too much. This version is all Patty Duke.

It is a good movie, but not the best rendition.",1239408000,,582,4.596153846153846

Melissa Gilbert was OK but was too old for this role and looked more like a 10 year old.  Overall the story is good but feel they could have looked for more appropriate actress to portray Helen and the original is just hard to compete with.,1503878400,,394,4.3108108108108105
