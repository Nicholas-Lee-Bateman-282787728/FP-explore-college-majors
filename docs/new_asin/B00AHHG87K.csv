8551603,1,B00AHHG87K,"A phony, He claimed to be a Navy SEAL and he never was. He did it to increase his business...  Do yourself a favor and shop elsewhere. Phony",1435190400,,140,4.0

8551605,5,B00AHHG87K,"Training for some summer Warrior Dashes, Spartan Runs, and while climbing some rock with my kids twisted my ankle and broke my foot.  The epithets that escaped!  Thought my training was over.  Had seen kettles but thought them too nerdy.  But since I couldn't run, walk, etc.  I decided to take a chance on Skogg and the kettles.  I have lost more inches around my waist and more fat than I would have believed.  Like his style; no nonsense, no cavorting, no needless banter.  Foot's healed, but continue to do this three times a week and love it.  Going to try his ""Home"" ones.  Recommend.  And my daughter loves it too.  She bought one for herself.",1430179200,,650,4.508620689655173
8551606,5,B00AHHG87K,Great workouts. Easy to follow with the hoped for results when putting the work in. Skogg DVD's always hit the mark!,1389225600,,116,4.571428571428571
8551607,3,B00AHHG87K,The workouts themselves are great however the editing is so bad I have had trouble watching; not to mention you can't fast forward through to the workout and the DVD only plays in my PC.  It won't play in the play station at all.  I've ended up writing down and taking screen shots of the moves and doing them to my own music.,1384128000,,326,4.158730158730159
8551608,3,B00AHHG87K,"The video is very dark, with very little light, and there is no background music so it is a little hard to stay motivated just listening to him talk, and listening to the 30 second beep constantly.  I like the moves but would have preferred a little more effort on final product...maybe he can perfect the next dvd...",1374451200,4,317,4.4655172413793105
8551609,5,B00AHHG87K,Great follow-up to the Skogg System DVDs! You will learn new moves and new combinations. Great fun and more challenging than the original DVDs.,1366761600,2,143,5.0
8551610,5,B00AHHG87K,"At this point I have done the strength and conditioning workouts from this disc multiple times and like them very much.  The strength and conditioning routines on this disc are rated as level II but in my opinion they are somewhat more intense than the routines from Phase 1 which are also level II.  I actually like them better than Phase 1 as they tend to focus more on the kettlebell although there are still plenty of body weight exercises as well.  I haven't done the power workouts yet because they do require double bells (which I don't have) and also look somewhat difficult and are rated as level IV.  I'm fine mixing the strength and conditioning workouts from this disc and the power workouts from Phase 1, at least until I can get some more bells.  I also tend to alternate between the ""At Home"" series and the original ""System"" discs for more variety.  All in all, if you like Skogg you'll love these workouts.",1362441600,9,923,4.530120481927711
8551611,5,B00AHHG87K,"i bought the Skogg Kettlebell system 5 DVD set last year and this year (2013) i bought Michael Skogg at home phase-1 and Phase-2. unbelievable! now i know a reviewer mentioned the production quality of the DVD but you have to remember its recorded live from Skoog on-line classes. all 6 workouts on both DVDs are incredible! i did the Skogg Kettlebell 5-DVD set for almost a year before getting phase 1 & 2. the 5 DVD set is a great way to build a good foundation before hitting phase 1 & 2. definitely recommend to everyone and anyone considering working with kettlebells. ive seen a few other workouts by others and the form is awful, im glad Michael Skogg knows his stuff.",1360886400,8,675,4.495934959349594
