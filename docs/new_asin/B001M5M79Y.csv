At first you think it's sort of like ""Sex & The City"", which is kind of is as far as the women are the main characters, but it goes from being ha-ha funny to man-that-happened-to-me-too! type of funny.  if you want to have the girls over for a good cry, rent this.  or you can watch it with your boyrfriend, the movie has a good job of showing the men's point of view on things.  Loved it!!!!",1230940800,18,449,4.174418604651163

3692674,4,B001M5M79Y,"In the 21st century, who says women can't pay for sexual gratification? This movie features two successful women, tired of dating and relationships, who decide to keep two young unemployed men in their pool house for strictly sexual purposes. Sexy and romantic, this indie flick debuted at the Cannes filmfest in 2008. It isn't weighed down by over-formulated, sanitized, predictable, sickly-sweet plot lines. Take ""Sex in the City,"" sprinkle in ""The Notebook,"" and voila!

What makes it hot: Falling in love with a really hot guy... and he loves you back!

Memorable scene: A fantasy revealed, then acted out, to a very funny conclusion.",1279929600,,638,5.125
3692675,5,B001M5M79Y,"I have just thoroughly enjoyed the last hour and half watching STRICTLY SEXUAL. I had to come online and praise it and let others know it's worth a look. Sometimes taking a risk and watching a lesser-known movie pays off and this is one of those cases. Full of wit, originality, twists, funny moments, refreshingly real back-and-forth conversation (and arguments!) sexual naughtiness and romance.

For those men (like me) and women who don't want to sit through an over-formulated, sanitized, predictable, sickly-sweet and cheesy film, this is the one to watch!

Superb!",1261094400,,570,5.184782608695652
3692676,4,B001M5M79Y,"I found this movie by accident, took a chance and enjoyed it thoroughly. It isn't as risque as the title might imply. I'm glad I hadn't seen the trailer prior to watching the movie. With a bit of gender role reversal, the story is a fun surprise. The female characters are likeable, whether i can or can't identify with their choices and actions. The setting and scenery are pleasant. Best part for me are the two gorgeous hunks!! Whoo hoo! I fell in love with Steve Long while watching.",1260576000,,487,4.48314606741573
3692677,4,B001M5M79Y,"I discovered this movie on hulu of all places and i thought this would be an interesting movie to pass the time with because i was bored, and when i got finished watching it, i was glad i did because i really enjoyed it. It's not your typical romantic comedy a.k.a ""chick flick"" that you'll see at the theater, it was deeper than that. It was more real, with real people and real relationships; and at the end it wasn't the typical happy ending, which is good because that crap can get boring real fast. It is definitely something that i am going to buy on DVD and have my boyfriend watch with me.

Not a Hollywood blockbuster, but well worth watching and enjoying.",1259020800,2,665,4.362903225806452
3692678,4,B001M5M79Y,"I went to HULU to look for a movie to watch tonight, which happened to be Halloween night. It seemed that there were mostly scary movies available, but I wasn't in that kind of mood. I read a brief description about this movie ""Strictly Sexual,"" and noticed that it was a comedy with a sexual theme. I thought that was rather novel (for me), so I checked it out. I felt turned off by the characters at first, but was taken in by the second or third scene, as the characters developed with the help of their partners and best friends, respectively. Overall, I think the story was sensitive and sensible and worth my time. The acting wasn't great, but it was perfect for this movie. I was happy to discover later, that the actor who played Stanny (Stevie Long), was also the writer. Way to go and thank you Stevie!",1256947200,2,812,4.3841059602649
3692679,3,B001M5M79Y,"I rented this based on the high reviews I read.  Was it all that?  I didn't think so, but it wasn't terrible either.  It had some deeper undertones that I could appreciate and some that were just too out there, and on the surface it was dry.  The storyline, albeit weak, could've shined a lot more with a different ending. At first I thought they were going to do it right, to include the one guy staying in LA, and getting his own place...then wha bammm, sure enough I was left with a blase ending.  Too buy?  Definitely not!  Too rent?  Well, only if there are a bunch of 1 to 2 star movies playing.",1256256000,,601,4.165217391304348
3692680,4,B001M5M79Y,"my wife was ""scare"" because of the title of the movie, but in the end she loved it, a very funny and romantic movie. i really recommend it.",1256256000,,139,4.0
3692681,4,B001M5M79Y,"This story was written by and starred Indie film writer Stevie Long.  If you like the concept of two girl friends meeting two guy friends, and experimenting with meaningless sex and casual nonchalant behavior because of it, then you will enjoy this film.

These girls have no interest in having a real relationship with any guy, but they still want sex and they want to have it as a needed pass time, not as a loving relationship, but that's not how it turns out.  Emotions get in the way and that causes them to actually discuss their feelings, which ruins everything for one couple, but blossoms into something special for the other couple.

One girl (Amber Benson) loves wild and carnivorous sex, while the other girl (Kristen Kerr) is more shy and inhibited. Of the guys, one guy (Stevie Long, this story's writer) feels compelled to insult women and yet that seems to make his girl more wild and horny.  While the other guy (Johann Urb), the nice guy (the mistake most of us guys make being) is more patient with his more hesitant shyer girl and yet their relationship grows into something more strong and meaningful. I don't think anybody here wanted to fall in love, but how cold, shallow, and disconcerting can you be if you continually keep the same person as your only sexual encounter?

I liked how the shy girl starts to realize her own need for sexual spontaneity, as the best scene (to me) is when they were in the car and she decided to just go down on him because her sexual yearnings were becoming more prevalent. She just had a great day at work, and so she wanted to reward herself with something sexual in the car, right away.  That was very cute.

This was a great film.  Even the deleted scenes (as an extra in the special features) offers some valuable dialogue about what everyone's feelings were about with their unique fabricated sexual situation with each other.  I would buy this film if I found it cheaper (or used) because I think it's a great movie to follow the film ""Sideways"" (which actually impressed me less).

 It's definitely worth renting once.  Check it out.",1254009600,8,2098,4.60752688172043

3692683,5,B001M5M79Y,"saw this at Cannes filmfest last year, loved it then, so just bought DVD.  commentary track was as funny as the movie.  if you like indie movies, you will love this movie.  if you want to see formulaic studio fare, rent something else.  essentially, this film is about intimacy, and how we falsely think nakedness and sharing our 'private parts' consitute intimacy, when, in fact, that is hardly true.  strongly reccomend to anyone who wants to see a brutally authentic film about the meaning of sex, and it's often forgotten partner, love.",1246492800,3,540,4.826086956521739
3692684,1,B001M5M79Y,"Initially I found the movie so unengaging (is that a word?) that I stopped watching it half way through. The next day curiosity got the best of me and I watched the remainder, which was no better.

I'm not sure what the problem is. The plot seems OK. The movie is about relationships and feelings, and perhaps the cut-rate cast is just not up to the challenge of making it believable. Or, perhaps the script is poorly written. Whatever the reason, I found the moving unabsorbing and thus uninteresting.",1246147200,,502,4.640449438202247

This is a true indie gem - it's a great movie - the emotional intelligence and depth is at the level of top Oscar winning films!  A film that I loved that it reminded me of was ""Closer"" though ""Strictly Sexual"" is much lighter and funnier - but just as affecting...

It's the MOST ROMANTIC movie i have seen in years without being sappy.  You have to watch it to understand.  absolutely the best VALENTINE'S DAY gift ever.  the only thing i didn't like so much in the film was the hand/held camera work, which on a big screen makes me a bit dizzy.

8320530,2,B001M5M79Y,"This is like a version of  ""Jay and Silent Bob""  except Bob talks.

This movie started out interesting and unusual.
But by the middle of the movie, there was no place for the story to go.
So, the ending was very predictable.

CONTAINS  SPOILERS . . .

Two women (roommates in a large house) are frustrated by relationships.  They decide to get male prostitutes because they only want sex but not boyfriends.  So, they go to a bar which is supposedly known for having male prostitutes, and they pick up two men who introduce themselves as out-of-work construction workers.  After bringing the men home and having sex with them all night, the two women attempt to pay the two men.  The men are shocked that they were assumed to be prostitutes, and the women are shocked that they really are out-of-work construction workers.  Although insulted, the two men accept the money because they are broke.  When the women hear that the men are about to be evicted, they tell the men that they may live in their pool-house, rent-free, until they find jobs, as long as they are available for sex whenever demanded.  I can't imagine any unemployed single men who would turn down this deal.

The movie goes downhill from there.  The men hang out in the pool-house all day while the women are at work, and at night they are invited into the big house for dinner, and then they have sex, repeat repeat repeat.  There is nowhere for the story to go, except to show four people having sex.  I didn't care about the characters.  I didn't care what happened next.

Although they are supposed to be  ""strictly sexual,""  they are living together just like two couples, and they end up having conversations, which lead to discussions and arguments just like real couples.  They spend a lot of time together, and emotions get in the way, and so there is a predictable ending.",1465516800,,1851,4.613496932515337

A girl objective is to make her man happy in bed. Another girl wants sex a lot and inspires her ""man"" to be a writer. Suddenly, one of the men is called be a model the next morning in Milan and the other ex-construction worker knows how to write and finish a book/story with a computer.

It is a unrealistic movie and the plot is kinda cliche and fantasy to please male audiences. It is condescending to male and female alike such as treating relationships as pure objects and skipping out many details and struggles about how two types of people from different worlds can come together at the first place.",1338595200,,893,4.478527607361963
