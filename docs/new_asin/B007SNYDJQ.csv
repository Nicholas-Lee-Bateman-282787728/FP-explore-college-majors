5109744,5,B007SNYDJQ,"So yeah, they're wearing lingerie. I sure as hell would be if my butt looked that good in a thong. These three gals are in fantastic shape, and it's no surprise why. This workout is mega-challenging. It's not like ""I want to throw up and die"" challenging (which is good, I don't reach for my Squeeze DVD because it's too difficult) but it's definitely a solid workout. The ab segment and low lunge leg segment are my favorites, and the instructor knows how to motivate me without being saccharine. I love the two other Pop Physique DVDs, too. I definitely feel this workout the next day, and over time it's made my tiny butt all nice and perky. I've got a pretty big collection of barre workout DVDs and this is one of my top 5.",1362960000,6,728,4.360294117647059
5109745,5,B007SNYDJQ,"Don't let the cover put you off... a great barre workout. Seems pretty easy but the next day, you will feel it. A full body workout, a good calorie burn. Definately a keeper in my rotation",1361750400,2,188,4.25
5109746,3,B007SNYDJQ,"Like the other reviews have stated, you WILL get a good, all-over workout.  It'll leave you sore and work muscles that you may not know you have.  I would use caution,however:The instructor is very flexible, and I can see some issues with her form.  For example, when she in in plank, her elbows are in a near-constant state of hyperextension.  Same with her shoulders and neck in cobra. Continuous/habitual hyperextension will lead to injury as well as serious issues later on, many of which can only be corrected with surgery. These are just 2 examples.  Unfortunately there are more.
I highly recommend taking a barre class, if possible, or doing a Bar Method or Squeeze DVD workout first, then come back to this one.  You'll learn proper alignment for the exercises and cut down your risk of injury.

(P.S., I'm a Pilates instructor, in case you're wondering where I get off criticizing her alignment, lol!)",1343001600,25,911,4.838709677419355
5109747,5,B007SNYDJQ,"Ok...My whole body got WORKED with this DVD.  I felt sore for days after, ALL OVER!  I enjoyed this immensely, despite the pain I was in...hurts so good! ;)",1335830400,,156,4.344827586206897
5109748,4,B007SNYDJQ,"Very fun and challenging. I haven't tried anything like this before, I'm more of a walker/jogger/cyclist. I can see better toning all over in the month that I've been using this. Still can't master some of the things Karyn asks of me (abs, I've never focused on them, so hard) but I'm staying at it. She is a great motivator and explains things well.",1414972800,,350,4.484375
5109749,5,B007SNYDJQ,"Love, love, love Pop Physique! I love the barre meets Pilates concept and they are a good addition to my dvd collection when I don't have a lot of time. Definitely feel it the next day in the quads.",1413072000,,198,4.102564102564102
5109750,4,B007SNYDJQ,Great exhilarating workout.  Pop physique workouts are def. for mid to advanced levels as they move from exercise to exercise quickly and which also require students to have a basic understanding of isometric fundamentals.  I love the instructers for their crazy motivational energy! If you're looking to be challenged and to feel that fabulous burn POP PHYS. is so for you!!!,1412899200,,376,5.147540983606557
5109751,4,B007SNYDJQ,"I just did this workout.  As the name says, It is pretty hardcore.  A few of the lower body moves really make my muscles quiver.  Barre workouts are my passion, and you definitely get a good one here.  if you like the other PopPhysique DVDs, you'll like this one, too.  I just have to downgrade for the outfits.  It takes away from the workout for me.  How can I take them seriously when I think they're going to swing on a pole any second?  Why not wear workout clothes for working out and lingerie for your personal time?  I like fun clothes, and have plenty of figure flattering workout wear, I just think this is taking it a little too far.  Also, with teenage boys in the house, I can't play these workouts when they're home - it would be like soft porn for them - as mom I am not going there.",1410048000,4,798,4.1568627450980395
5109752,5,B007SNYDJQ,This is an intense barre workout for an at-home DVD!  If you can get past the lingerie workout wear...you'll be sweating throughout the entire hour.  Some of the moves are unlike anything I've ever done in my Barre classes....and take some practice getting used to. But change is always good!  And I try and mix this DVD into my regular class routine or when I cannot get to the gym.  I like that this DVD works various parts of the body.,1407888000,2,438,4.37037037037037
5109753,5,B007SNYDJQ,"If you like pop physique in person, you'll like these DVDs. Easy to do at home, and no props required except for a chair (weights are part of the workout, but you can do the routine without them).

Very happy with this purchase.",1402272000,2,228,4.3023255813953485
5109754,5,B007SNYDJQ,My new favorite on the barre workout.  Awesome.  Already seeing changes in my body.  Very effective exercises but fun to do.,1393545600,2,124,4.809523809523809
5109755,1,B007SNYDJQ,"My review is solely about the cardboard packaging the DVD comes in.  I have ordered a lot of DVD's that have come in either the plastic covers or cardboard covers.  100% of the ones that come in the cardboard covers comes scratched and 8% of the DVD's that come in plastic covers come scratched.

ETA My DVD came scratch because of the cardboard packaging and because of the scratch the DVD would not play.",1381104000,5,406,4.45945945945946
5109756,5,B007SNYDJQ,Great workout that is very similar to the classes (which cost ~20 bucks a pop). Totally worth buying the DVD!,1372896000,5,109,4.5
5109757,5,B007SNYDJQ,This is an intense one hour workout that simulates going to a class better than any other I have found.,1366502400,5,103,4.2
8521661,1,B007SNYDJQ,They copy the entire barr method workout. Maybe they were aiming for a younger audience given the outfits and very relaxed explanations.  I prefer burr's bar method video and the Dancer's body workout.,1444608000,,201,5.090909090909091
8521662,5,B007SNYDJQ,I go to Pop Physique and Barre Lab in hollywood 3X a week. If I can't make it for whatever reason these videos are a wonderful alternative. Although the music and energy at the real studio is much more engaging these a great and inexpensive.,1438214400,2,241,4.377777777777778

8521664,5,B007SNYDJQ,"I was new to barre workouts a few months ago. I wanted a serious challenge and I got it -- I truly have to stop myself from throwing my chair at the TV when doing the micro-movement lunges. It's definitely done great things to my legs and butt (and I usually go hard on other HIIT workouts)! Even the cheap, flimsy cardboard packaging isn't enough to knock off a star.",1428019200,,368,4.271428571428571
8521665,5,B007SNYDJQ,"*I bough this DVD directly from the Pop Physique online shop*

This is my favourite DVD in this series. Karyn takes you through quite an intense workout, motivating you all along. You don't realise how hard it is until the next day when your whole body is sore. But it is so worth it! I love these exercises and the music is very upbeat so it keeps you going and doesn't let you quit.",1424044800,,384,4.1891891891891895
8521666,5,B007SNYDJQ,"Love, love it! While I am not a fan of the outfits, I appreciate the intensity of the workout. I have taken Pop Physique classes and this DVD was quite similar, perhaps, even harder. The DVD was recommended by one of the instructors when I asked which one to purchase. I've taken Pure Barre, Dailey Method, barre3 classes, and two other local studios, and Pop Physique always kicks my butt, which I love. My favorite part of this workout is that its fun. The music is just right for the workout, and the instructors are encouraging (two instructors - they each teach half of the workout). Need: 1-4 lb weights (not too heavy as the high repetitions make heavier weights a bit much) and a sturdy chair. I've used the kitchen table/counter before.",1423267200,,745,4.609022556390977

8521668,5,B007SNYDJQ,"I adore Original Butt and Hardcore definitely takes it to the next level! I can't sing the praises of pop physique enough. My body has seriously changed after a few months with these dvds, and the workouts are still challenging. I am so happy I started doing these workouts and can't recommend them enough!",1421798400,2,306,4.685185185185185
8521669,5,B007SNYDJQ,"Cheesy intro about ""cheating on your gym"" is TRUE! I get just as good of a workout as when I do go to the gym for barre class!",1417564800,,126,3.5357142857142856
