3681922,4,B001L8YQ64,"GARDENS OF THE NIGHT starts out in this picture perfect neighborhood, as seven year old Leslie walks by herself to school. Alex (played by Tom Arnold) approaches her and asks her to help him find his dog, Trixie. Because he knows how to manipulate and ask the right questions, he gets Leslie to believe that not only does he know her dad, but he is actually Alex's boss. His plan seems to work, because he is able to get her to trust him enough to drop her off at school. Hours later, he is accompanied by Frank (who would appear to be his son) and as she is leaving school, they tell her that her dad has an ""emergency,"" and makes her come with them. She appears to be drugged by the soda that she drinks, because she then sleeps for hours on end. They take her to a house, where she meets Donnie, who appears to be in the same situation that she is in.

This movie is very difficult to watch, as it deals with kidnapping and child prostitution. My skin was crawling as I watched Jimmy (played by Jeremy Sisto) giving Alex a photo album to look through, containing pictures of hundreds of solicited children. He explains that the client may come to them, or the child may have to fly to another part of the country, in which he would go with the child. The only light at the end of the tunnel for Leslie is that she and Donnie become connected in a way that they love and take care of each other. They agree to meet in a special place if they are ever separated from each other.

As they get older, you see that they are still together, but their lives are rough, and you wonder if they will ever find their families, or any kind of happiness again. I cried a lot while watching this, especially at the end.

Though the movie is well edited, sometimes it's a little too close for comfort. There are also a lot of unanswered questions. But, emotions run high and I had a difficult time tearing my eyes away from the screen.

3681923,4,B001L8YQ64,"The movie was well done, although disturbing. Ryan Simpkins, Gillian Jacobs, Jermaine Scooter Smith, Kevin Zegers, and Tom Arnold were excellent in their various roles.  This is one of those films I believe every parent and therapist should see with time set aside after watching for returning to normal.  The first half of the movie surpassed the second half, although terrifying for any parent of young children due to the content.  The movie is one of those that comes along every so often that can easily twist and wrench one's heart as one sees the abhorrent result of child abduction and defilement.  The director's comments do help in clarifying some aspects of the film.",1256515200,4,678,4.921052631578948
3681924,5,B001L8YQ64,"...in this world, but it is.  The acting in this movie is phenomenal all around, especially the kids.  Despite the sad and depressing subject matter the cinematography is beautiful and masterfully lit.

If you're looking for a Hollywood movie then this is definitely not it.  Move on.  But if you love great and genuine movie making that comes from a true passion to tell a real story, and isn't just fluff and superficial nonsense, then you will find that and more in this movie.

By the way, these traffickers of children as sex slaves should get the death penalty.  No mercy.",1248393600,,578,4.663366336633663
3681925,5,B001L8YQ64,"Gardens of the Night is a film that deals with the unfortunate circumstance involving a little girl going to school who happens to be the victim of a man who decides to kidnap her.  There's a sad kind of build up that happens in the kidnapping process that shows what's about to happen to the girl as soon as she makes the choice to get inside that car.

This of course, changes the girls life drastically, because she's too small to run away from the guy for fear of her life (even though the guy acted very polite towards the girl and treated her like he would his own daughter, he definitely had his issues obviously) and she's too small to do anything other than cry, be afraid, and feel a dreaded sense of uncertainty.

Now the poor girl has to live with the guy who kidnapped her along with another man who had a serious attitude problem.  I think the other man was someone who was kidnapped many years before and grew up respecting the guy like a father.

While living with these two guys, the little girl soon realizes there's another boy around her age living with them, and the little girl becomes friends with the boy.  The friendship they develop sticks with them for many years, well into their adult life.

This movie is shocking to me because kidnapping is an unfortunate and horrible (and downright frightening) thing that happens in reality, and the film shows it from the perspective of the little girl who is kidnapped.

Gardens of the Night will have you wondering and attached to your TV screen anticipating what will happen next for the poor little girl.

The ending of the movie is spectacular and made me cry a little bit.  I kind of knew it was coming, but it still hit me pretty hard.  You really feel for the girl the entire time and want her to pull through all the obstacles that lay before her.  Will she survive?  You'll have to find out.",1248307200,,1869,4.4298245614035086
3681926,5,B001L8YQ64,"Only my second time commenting on Amazon, but after unexpectedly turning on this movie, I just had to set the record straight on this very depressing yet impossible to look away movie.

First of all, this is an incredibly well done, even if disturbing film.  As another reviewer wrote, ""what you don't see is the most disturbing.""  Secondly, without ruining the ending, I believe there are few unanswered questions.  The film shows you how the protagonists part ways with Alex and Frank, and the final scene hints at what the future holds for Leslie and Donnie.  However, any truly unanswered questions might be intentional.  The story fast forwards a few years, but what happened during those years is irrelevant after watching the first half of the movie; you know how they lived their lives for so many years leading up to that point.

As another reviewer said, it would be difficult to re-watch, but a powerful story nonetheless.  Ryan Simpkins did an amazing job playing young Leslie.",1246147200,7,989,4.880239520958084
3681927,4,B001L8YQ64,"This movie is a difficult but riveting watch. It's not often you find a movie that you can FEEL through the emotions of the actors, and even more rare to be sucked in by an actress all of 8 years old.

The first part of the movie dealt with the abduction and subsequent lives of two young children in a ring of sex slavery. This was by far the most powerful part of the movie for me. The young girl that played the part of Leslie blew me away. The older girl that played her in the latter part of the movie couldn't measure up.

I gave this movie 4 stars on the strength of the emotion it contained, and the incredible acting in the first half. I 'only' gave this movie 4 stars because the second half was weaker in acting and in story line. There are a lot of holes in this story - too many unanswered questions.

I wholeheartedly recommend this movie for adults, but the content is too extreme for children. Even though there is absolutely no graphic depiction of what is happening whatsoever. It's what you don't see that is the most disturbing.",1245628800,2,1048,4.282828282828283
3681928,5,B001L8YQ64,"I gave this movie 5 stars because of the phenomenal acting.  You will cry when you watch it.  It's the type of film that is very difficult to watch, but you can't stop watching it.  The questions I have are:  What happened to Alex and Frank and how did Leslie and Donnie get away from them?  Does Leslie ever find Donnie?  And it would have been nice to see Leslie and Donnie's lives as adults.  Despite the lack of details, it was a great independent movie.  I'm not sure it's worth buying, because you will most likely only watch it once.",1245110400,18,540,4.2772277227722775
3681929,2,B001L8YQ64,"Saw this film recently on Showtime and it was based on the fact that John Malkovich was in it but unfortunately it is primarily a cameo of about 10 minutes of screen time.  The kidnapping of a little girl from her San Diego home was harrowing to say the least and the acting from Tom Arnold as the abductor and Jeremy Sisto, Harold Perrineau as his confederates was also very good but the film just dragged on to its dismal conclusion.  I often wonder what the filmmakers intent was to have such an un resolved ending?  I was hoping that the female, now a teenager would slowly be indoctrinated back into her family.  What's also missing from this disappointing film is that we are not shown what the abductors did when she reached the teen age or how she was dumped back into society.  So basically the blame is on the writer and director of this film rather than the actors the actress playing grown teenage girl lacks a center in her acting.",1245024000,3,944,4.433526011560693
3681930,5,B001L8YQ64,"This movie was done very well.  It opens your eyes to the adverse effect that young kids go through who are abducted from their family and friends.  Children are not as tune to deception of people that they are easily persuaded by strangers to follow them.  All parents should take the time and talk to their kids.  Everyone is a stranger and be careful if it is someone you don't know that is trying to be nice to you.

All of the actors in this movie did an excellent job.",1240704000,17,474,4.222222222222222
3681931,4,B001L8YQ64,"As a parent, I understand the importance of the content regarding children being kidnapped domestically and ending up lost in the sex/slave rings, but man this was a difficult watch. Even harder than Holly (also trailered on this DVD).

The story follows a young, upper-middle class girl (played incredibly by Ryan Simpkins, who coincidentally blew me away with her brief adult-style performance in Balls Out) as she is lured by a pedophile into an irreversible life of long term abuse and abandonment. The film flashes between her youth and later adult existence on the streets. No part of this topic is easy to watch, but everyone plays their roles adequately. Tom Arnold is absolutely scary as the pedophile, he was completely believable to the extreme.

The video and sound quality were fine, and the supplements cover the array of related topics. The deleted scenes were thankfully cut out (even more graphic), but it did show the obvious confusion towards the end of the film in the writing and editing. Malkovich and Sisto already had abbreviated parts, but as I was watching the end Michelle Rodriguez' part seemed strangely miscut, but then left in the deleted scenes, as were the alternate parent actors' roles. The credit listings supplement to help people learn about this topic were too ""edgy"" and distracting, it could have been made more straightforward and a great deal clearer.

3681956,5,B001L8YQ64,"I didn't love the movie it was quite heartbreaking, but I respect the story that was being told. As a social worker, I know this is the reality. Human sex trafficking and domestic slavery are real. I believe that this movie did an accurate job in showcasing how abductors manipulate children and reshape them into what they want them to be. It really gave the viewer an insight into the mentality of abusers and how they justify their crime. Then we see the cycle starting again when Lindsey brought the 12-year-old girl into the fold, but thankfully she had a change of heart. The two things I didn't like was that we never really got Donnie's story, this movie focuses mostly on Lindsey. The second thing I didn't like was the ending that really wasn't an ending. I know that they said if they were ever separated they'd meet at Wonderland in FL, but did either of them make it?",1501200000,3,880,4.50625

3681958,4,B001L8YQ64,"Fortunately, I can't be certain of the absolute accuracy of most of this film. Unfortunately, in general, it does seem right on target to me. What I wanted to add, though, is about that ending that so many viewers don't seem to like. Sure, I too would have much preferred a happy ending. But in order to show the reintegration of the main character back into her original family after the life on the streets that she's lived, the writers would have had to turn this film into a double feature. As it stands, the ending they did select, in my view, if anything, weighs in on the side of accuracy.",1500940800,,596,4.378378378378378

3681996,4,B001L8YQ64,"BEWARE SPOILERS!

You will not be redeemed. You will not find catharsis. You may very well feel deeply depressed at the depravity of some human beings.

We can begin with Alex (Tom Arnold) who loves little Leslie (Ryan Simpkins) so deeply and tenderly that he deprives her of her childhood to satisfy his lust. And then theres his bud Frank (Kevin Zegers) who helps Alex drug the children.

Some years pass. Leslie (Gillian Jacobs) is now 17. She is living in San Diego sleeping under a life guard station or under the freeway with Donnie (as a child played by Jermaine 'Scooter' Smith and then by Evan Ross) the other child abducted by Alex and Frank. The viewer can guess that Leslie and Donnie were just dumped somewhere when Alex and Frank got tired of them. (And we can guess that Alex and Frank found other children to enslave and molest.) Leslie smokes, does drugs, prostitutes herself, and hangs out with lowlifes on the streets. One lowlife (I forget his name) wants Leslie to entice a 12-year-old girl into prostitution. She is told that he will give her to only the best people including a judge. Apparently he has a ring of enslaved girls that he shops around to the best people.

At this point the viewer is understandably waiting for Leslie and Donnie to find themselves, to break free of the hopeless life on the street. Enter Michael at the homeless shelter (John Malkovich in what is little more than a cameo). He discovers an old flyer with little Leslies photo and the plea from her loving and distraught parents for the return of their missing daughter. Prior to seeing this Leslie believed from years of being brainwashed by Alex that her parents didn't love her and were glad to be rid of her. Michael says, Its time for you to go home, Leslie.

And so Leslie does. And what happens is in some ways the most disturbing part of the movie.

The cast is outstanding. I was particularly impressed with Ryan Simpkins, Gilliam Jacobs and Evan Ross. Damian Harris, who wrote and directed, gives us a view of humanity that is unrelentingly debased. There is no doubt about his skill and dark vision. I just hope that next time out he does something positive.

3682002,3,B001L8YQ64,"Ok, first of all. Gillian Jacobs did a fine job with what she was given, but when she portrayed the 17 year old Leslie in this film she was 25, and she looks 25. Or older. Other reviewers mentioned feeling disconnected from the characters in the second half, this was part of the problem for me. I kept thinking - wait, she's still a homeless kid on the street, at age 30? Gillian does not have a kid's face. Donny (Evan Ross) looked the correct age.

This film doesn't truly rise above the after-school special, facts-of-life nature of the storyline. Here's how predators groom kids, here's how they psychologically manipulate them, here's (a little) about how kids survive that by creating their own secret world of safety, here's how predators make mistakes, here's what happens to the kids when they are discarded and when they try to return home without adequate supports or family prep.

Director/writer Damian Harris is competent. This is the film he set out to make, and he made it. No risks, none. It's a resume piece on the way to bigger budgets. The actors are competent. Tom Arnold could have definitely played the predator in a much higher caliber of film. He was willing to go there. Any gold that this film has, he supplies it. Evan Ross, as teen-age Donny, I also could have watched a lot more of,  I would have rather the story focused on him. He gave the relatively small part some depth and complexity of feeling. Jacobs was fine, she adequately portrayed ""almost totally dead inside except for a tiny little wisp of rebellion that will likely amount to nothing."" The completely unappealing casting for Leslie's parents were genius. I would have snuck out and run away as well. Who would want to live in that house with them?

 A reviewer asked if it was possible to make a non-exploitative film about child sex trafficking, pointing out that the first half of this film is exploitative. Yes, it is possible, if you are willing to make the child the protagonist, if you are willing to go into the realm of ""child as subject."" Which involves a lot of make believe. More dissociation than you would think possible. Feeling things from their point of view. A lot of pain. This film did not set out to do that. It set out to make a film that would be shown at a film festival and would showcase the writer/director's ability to make mediocre films, which are the kind that, in this world, are big box office hits.",1498521600,,2428,4.585253456221198

I hope it encourages parents to play the ""what if"" game with their kids because kid's often don't know if a person is actually a stranger if they say they know your parents. They don't think they can call 911 if they're not sure if it's an emergency. After Leslie and Donny got older I felt that the viewer loses the emotional attachment we felt for them in the beginning and it starts to feel more like a ""Lifetime Movie"". The scene with Leslie's parents was a letdown. I was really disappointed that the end didn't feature any statistics on child abduction, human trafficking, or a phone number or website for people who want to learn more or get involved.",1498435200,12,801,4.493150684931507

Not only the trauma of being abducted for the child, but the trauma of losing a child for the parents.

It truly brings home the dangers in society and strengthens the need to be watchful and protective of your children and others around you. Dangers lurk everywhere and can be viewed as kindness in the beginning, as this story portrayed.

The thing to remember, the first act of betrayal to another isn't the most harmful, it's the long term of mental conditioning that has the ultimate effect of destroying another one's life. The actors did an amazing job showing these emotions. I wanted to get up so many times and yell at the TV, just run, run, run....

He made a boxoffice hit with showing brutal horror moster showing all kinds of moments the girl raped by her own cousins.
 Now this movie was really different. It was really carefully approaching the matter.
 The movie is about a girl who was kidnapped to two men and she was suffered to be in child porn and also had to serve a bunch of crap who are seeking for child sexually.
 Luckily she was not all alone and there was a boy- an Afro-American boy who was also kidnapped. They were like brothers.
 When they eventually got out from that place, they two were the only one for each other who take care of each other.
 When she and the boy grow up, all they can do is become a hooker.

3682032,5,B001L8YQ64,"This is not an entertaining or enjoyable film, but it has an incredibly strong message. Although the characters are fictitious the subject matter isn't which is why it is so incredibly difficult to watch. It's like watching a holocaust movie you'd rather turn off, but can't because you owe it to the victims watch and understand. I have 4 children and was so incredibly disturbed we had to have the talk again, but I distinctly felt nothing I could ever say would be enough to fully protect them from people like these. These cases are incredibly rare, but trafficking isn't and we should think about that when we watch this as well. This cuts close, because it's a sweet little girl in white suburbia, but that is not at all typical. It made me afraid for my kids even though I know this particular scenario is so rare the paranoia so many parents have borders on irrational. Once I was able to work through that initial shock and panic it left me with a deep sense of sorrow for the children and women all over the world being sexually exploited and enslaved.

Ultimately that is what this film left me with. It took the trafficking films and documentaries and news stories and suddenly the little Taiwanese, Latino, Slavic, or countless other impoverished faces and replaced them with my child's face. I hope the message isn't that we need to intensify our already over the top helicopter parenting, but rather to understand at our core that no matter who or where we need to stop this and we're doing a deplorable job of it.  I have cried at those films and I am always outraged the world is doing so little, but this film brought it home in a way that is so terrifying and shocking it takes awhile to catch your balance and see the bigger picture.",1456272000,39,1753,4.526813880126183

It just really makes you think twice before judging someone who drinks or is on drugs. You never know what a person had to go through so we need to pray for one another and help one another. I think the movie definitely will make people aware of the dangers in the world. I can honestly say that after watching this movie your perception will never be the same.

Tom Arnold tries to play some sort of a compassionate pedophile/kidnapper/child pimper.  That pig will never have wings, I have no pity for them.
 At least the woman finally backs out of becoming a child pimper herself later.
Then it leaves us all feeling like crap when she leaves her parents and siblings again after reuniting.

Because if a film can elicit strong emotions, then it is probably doing something right; just know ahead of time what you are getting yourself into.

As one who years ago did a stint of ""down and out"" time on the beaches of San Diego, Gardens of the Night reminded me of certain other youths I met who had pasts probably along the lines of these characters... watching this film painted a picture for me that I was unable to really comprehend in the past. It is my hope that Gardens of the Night and its sister film, Mysterious Skin, will help to instigate much needed public conversations that will eventually turn into action (thru NPOs and tax dollars), changing the future for victims and potential victims. We need more people like the counselor played by John Malkovich to become non-fictitious.

The ending of Gardens of the Night is abrupt, but not jarring (in fact it is open-ended). Like many thought-provoking films, it leaves open possibilities that are up to the viewer to decide upon.

3682069,5,B001L8YQ64,"Although ""Gardens Of The Night"" is an outstanding film, it proved to be extremely difficult to watch.  It's a strange film, but it contains a powerful message, a cautionary tale about the horrors of child pornography and child prostitution. Tom Arnold will make your skin crawl as Alex, the pedophile who lures a delicate little blonde girl named Leslie - brilliantly portrayed first by Ryan Simpkins as a child, and then by Gillian Jacobs - with the creepy ""lost puppy"" ruse, with horrifying results. And you definitely get the feeling his sleazy young sidekick, Frank (Kevin Zegers), had once been Alex's victim as a child many years before. Another skin-crawling scene is when a sinister child pornographer and pimp named Jimmy (Jeremy Sisto) drives Leslie to the home of a judge - now here's a truly upstanding, model citizen - who just happens to be a pedophile.

Eventually, Leslie and Donnie, a young black boy about her age (portrayed by Jermaine ""Scooter"" Smith as a child, and then by Evan Ross), whom Alex had also abducted, are lost to the streets - lost kids in the lost world of street prostitution and hustling to survive.  ""Gardens Of The Night"" is an extremely disturbing film, and not for the faint of heart, but it's also an important film: Leslie is a latch-key child - a child who's left on her own a lot because both her parents are working.  While all children are vulnerable to sexual molestation and sexual trafficking, of course, it's the latch-key children who face the greatest danger from sexual predators.  Always be active in your child's life.  Always listen.  Always have your child's back, and make sure your child knows this.",1410998400,11,1660,4.823943661971831

Tom Arnold proves he can stand on his own and is much more than an extension of Roseanne.  I'm glad because he seems like a good guy except in character in this movie, but even that is a dichotomy......he seems protective and fatherly to his captives although he exploits them.  What great acting!

Movie deals with a serious subject matter and is a must see by parents.  It is not an exploitive movie.

It certainly isn't fun to watch. I know there are people out there doing the things that are done in this movie, but I don't need to see it.

A young girl gets kidnapped by a man (well played by Tom Arnold) and his buddy who first use her in internet child porn and then for prostitution. This is scary and painful to watch. What makes it tougher to view is the Tom Arnold character. He isn't a nasty, mean, drooling individual. He does seem to care for her at some level, and you get the hint his upbringing wasn't very joyous so he's not so easy to write off. He has also kidnapped a young African American boy for the same purposes and these two kids realize they are all they have and form a bond.

You skip ahead some 10 years or so and the two (Leslie and Frank) are still together. But now the Tom Arnold character and his buddy are gone and the kids are on the streets. They smoke, drink, do drugs and turn tricks. The people they hang with are the same. It's an ugly realization.

Through her trying to get into a shelter, the administrator, played by John Malkovich, finds out who she is and is able to send her home and reunite her with her family. I won't spoil it for you but let's say that Hollywood is no where to be found here.

Again. This is good. The writing, acting, camerawork, sound and music are as good as they need to be to get this done and done well. I don't know if it could have been done any better, but darn. I need hope in my life and you won't find it here.",1283385600,14,1649,4.095975232198143
3682120,5,B001L8YQ64,"Watched a haji copy of this film.  I'll get a real copy later to see all the extras in the film.

I squirmed in my seat watching the first 1/2 hour of the movie, then threw it in the trash as the movie, with much implied off camera tricks, presented criminal activity involving minors.  The story knawed and badgered my mind to go back to the trash can, retrieve the movie and see what happened to the poor victims in the movie.

My compliments to the director for paring down the typical Hollywood violence to that of Hitchcock-implied violence so the audience isn't scared away from the subject matter.

The performances by all thespians in the movie were great, I look forward in viewing future parts they will take up.  Kudos to Tom Arnold for his portrayal of the bad guy-- I never thought he had such acting ability in him.  The rest of the actors are just as note worthy.

It's hard to determine when to discuss this subject matter with young kids.  Such knowledge can put a damper on their childhood; on the other hand, ignorance is worse.

It's great to review a movie that makes the audience think.",1280707200,2,1108,4.467661691542289

Of course they can't go home; they aren't the same, the people that lost them have, by this point, moved on. I don't cry often, but this was heartbreaking.",1521158400,,356,4.3283582089552235

8317593,5,B001L8YQ64,"The beginning was incredibly hard to watch. Don't watch this if you have a weak stomach for watching sexual abuse in movies, because child abuse is much, much worse. The movie was pretty well done, though. There were incredibly strong performances, but the storyline kind of just jumped from the two children being held captive, to being teenagers living on the streets. It doesn't explain what happened or when. I'm not sure if I would want to watch this again, but its because of the theme. I have nothing negative to say about the actors.",1516924800,,541,4.705263157894737

Tom Arnold plays a perfect creeeeepo.  you kind of respect him for his acting ability.  but really it was almost unbearable to watch.  the movie spent way too much time on Leslie's early early life with her captors.  they could have shown her get older.  only by reading the amazon description did i learn that the captors eventually abandoned Leslie and Donnie.  they could have spent a little time on that too, instead of completely jumping to when they're 18.  the end shows the bond between the two, but other than that, it honestly wasn't worth watching.",1515628800,,625,4.820754716981132
