8200988,5,B000RJEIAM,"I just purchased this series and have watched about a half-dozen episodes. They're really interesting. The script is tight, the acting is good, the pace never drags. More of a ""police procedural"" than the modern crop of UK shows ('The Coroner"",""Midsomer Murders"", etc.). The Gideon character isn't always center stage, his assistant sometimes gets an episode to himself. One thing that's especially interesting are the views of London as it really was in the 60's. It's not the hi-class neighborhoods or backlot sets from ""The Saint"", this is stuff we US viewers have never seen before. Of course, for us it's a little hard to tell a slum from another old English building. One episode had shots of Battersea Water Pumping station in it, I guess if you knew London this clued you in to something! Didn't mean a thing to me.
But if you have a Pal compatible region-free player, I recommend this series to you. Music is by Edwin Astley (""The Saint""), but I must warn you the main theme is an annoying little march with lots of flutes! If this had been filmed in color I think it would have made it's way over the Atlantic and been a hit here.",1507161600,,1140,4.5931372549019605
