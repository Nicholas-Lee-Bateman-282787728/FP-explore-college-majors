The eastern religions and ancient realigns share the path of enlightenment. However it is up to us to make the journey. Only the western religion is at odds with nature by making symbols facts.

The message is reiterated in several ways so we have opportunity to realize that we need forgotten symbols and can regain them through our dreams.

He leaves us with the question as to will we ever be able to become one with nature once more?

Hinduism gives us the best presentation or mythology to fit our time.

This is just a simplistic review of a presentation that has so much depth that no review can do it justice.",1507507200,2,763,4.5
7796242,5,1561764108,"Sukhavati is a compilation of a variety of lectures given by Mr. Campbell over the course of many years(10+). This DVD provides a cursory view from JC's scholarly perspective on a dizzying array of subject matters, from economics to religion, from cavemen to astronauts and most importantly from the depths of human psychology to the relationship with mythology.

This DVD can take you places you can't even begin to imagine, if you let it.

""You hear a pang, mother or something...""
-Freud or Campbell?

""'Very deep is the well of the past, should we not call it bottomless?' And as one who has strived himself to go back to the origins of mythic forms, I can see this, it is bottomless. The mythological themes don't have a beginning, they have the archetypes....And so where is paradise, where do they come from? They come from desilee, the soul. The origin is from the soul of man.""
-Campbell

""At present, our world has rejected this world of symbology. It has gone into an
economic and political phase, where spiritual principles are completely disregarded. You may have practical ethics and that kind of thing, but there is no
spirituality in any aspect of our contemporary Western civilization. Our religious
life is ethical, not mystical. The mystery has gone and society is disintegrating as a result.""
-Campbell

""The question is whether or not there can ever be a recovery of the mythological,
mystical realization of the miracle of life of which human beings are a manifestation.""
-Campbell

Not for everyone, but for anyone who wants to understand the human condition.",1230854400,,1582,4.928571428571429

7796244,5,1561764108,"""I am yesterday, today, and tomorrow. I have the power to be born a second time. I am the source and creator of all the gods.""  are the opening words uttered by Joseph Campbell in this 80 minute DVD where the viewer is taken to a place rarely visited; his own consciousness.  Joseph Campbell achieves this by weaving knowledge, religion, philosoby, mysticism, and mythology into a coherent lecture/poem where all we know about the world around us and its symbols are manifestaions of the Divinity in all of us.  To put it bluntly: Get ready for a ride unlike any other, this DVD is awesome and will have you wondering and contemplating your life.  I was truly inspired and every few months I find myself watching this DVD to remind myself that whatever Gods and Devils are around us are there because they are within us.  Unlike anything I've ever seen.  If you ever find yourself musing the words ""is this it? there must be something more"" then I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1197331200,2,984,4.626436781609195
7796245,1,1561764108,"I love Joseph Cambell's work.  This video is a good introduction to someone who is not familiar with Campbell but it is not his best.  If you have seen Campbell's other works, there is very little new here.

My biggest complaint is that the sound track is sometimes distracting and annoying.  At several points in the video the audio of Campbell speaking is very quiet.  As you try to listen to what he is saying the sound track comes blasting in with Buddhist chanting or other music that washes out Campbell's voice.

The Mythos series is far, far better than this video. Even ""The Power of Myth"", Campbell's interview's with Bill Moyers, is more interesting and more informative that this video.

I suggest that you save your money and buy a different Joseph Campbell video.",1124496000,19,777,4.711111111111111
7796246,5,1561764108,"In the celebration of the Catholic High Mass, incense, candles, music, fashion, architecture and ritual all work together to create a mood for the revelation of sacred scripture. In the current globalized world of our time, we now have available a wide range of wisdom from different cultures and traditions, which tends to transcend any one particular religious organization or possible service.

Joseph Campbell has devoted his life to the study and teaching of the world's mythologies as they have evolved throughout the course of human history.  In ""Sukhavati Place of Bliss"", directors Maxine Harris and Sheldon Rochlin have attempted to create a poetic audio/video context in which to best appreciate the fruits of Mr. Campbell's life work.  The film builds up layer upon layer of image and sound until the meaning of these myths is evoked, rather than explicated.

The presentation opens with meditations on some of the creation mythology, then rapidly works to brings these ideas into a connection with the scientific world view of the present.  Mr. Campbell feels that myths from the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures best fit the present cosmology of the universe, so much of the program is devoted to speaking about these ideas. The other major theme of the work is the diversity of nature and our role as a part of it.

Greek mythology, Native European wisdom along with the applied Christian traditions, and the myths of the Aboriginal Americans are all resources which have been taped in the weaving of this captivating project.

One can sense in the viewing of the program, that their is no substitute for the years of devotion towards this subject matter, that each of the contributers to the film has provided.  Much like attendance to a religious service, the viewing of this compelling program may help one to become more open to relating with the concepts and experience of transcendence.  This is a journey which is well worth taking every few months to help keep an eye on life's big picture.",1093132800,48,2010,4.976119402985074
7796247,4,1561764108,"Now that the Joseph Campbell craze of the early nineties has abated just a bit, the Sukhavati release by Mystic Fire Video recaptures what all the excitement was about. Campbell lucidly exposulates on all manner of philosophy and mythology to an attentive audience in Northern California. Interspersed with the lecture are beautiful images filmed throughout the natural and man/woman made world.  Campbell's lecture is loaded with perennial references and it's convenient to skip back quickly via DVD technology to replay  previous statements to better follow the thread of a Campbell insight. Place of Bliss is also a nice compliment to the Bill Moyers interviews. The single DVD may seem a bit $$$, but the material is so deep that I find myself playing the program once every few months, so it's worth the price!",1043625600,59,815,5.074626865671642
7796248,4,1561764108,"This video is a meditation. Campbell's thoughts on life, myth, and religion (excerpts from his lectures) are presented together with images and music that complement them. There are many insights here. The video is both relaxing and thought provoking.
There really is no central theme, other than the broad one of myth, religion, and the thoughts of Campbell. For those who have read Campbell's works, there is nothing new here, but the music, images, and Campbell's words fit together nicely.",989712000,31,493,5.175
