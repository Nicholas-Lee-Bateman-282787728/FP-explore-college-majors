This is a low-budget stinker that is just tedious to watch.  Silly things happen in it.  You hear thunder, but when the main character goes outside, it's not raining and doesn't look like it will.  He makes an impromptu grave but isn't sweaty or dirty after doing it.

Many critics of Spanish-language TV and film have condemned the media for focusing on white Hispanics and practically ignoring those of African or Native ancestry.  The same problem happens here.  On the one hand, Southern Florida is supposed to be a special place because of its unique ethnic blend and Cuban population.  However, hiring no phenotypic people of color for this film is offensive and shuts doors to actors of color who could have benefited from the experience.

This film steals from ""Scarface,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""Menace II Society,"" and probably many others.  Only watch this if you truly want to see something that is low-quality.",1160870400,,1120,5.0
