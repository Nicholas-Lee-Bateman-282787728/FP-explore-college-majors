6016669,1,B00FPNQHWW,My husband did not like the movie and was highly disappointed.,1414022400,,62,4.7272727272727275
6016670,2,B00FPNQHWW,"Unwatchable is not the right word for this movie, daytime soap opera is; but unwatchable comes pretty close.  This ""movie"" has the feel of a daytime soap; the video and set lighting itself literally feels thin with over-saturated lighting.  The sets are obviously such and the acting is simply made for TV.  The acting is sometimes better than bad kung fu acting in all actuality, but then you'll miss out on all of the bad kung fu acting!  And the ""martial arts"" training?  Feh!  The fighting?  Horrid!

The plot concerns a king's servant whose sister is (literally) consumed by the king's love for her.  He vows vengeance and tries to get the Shaolin monks to teach him that groovy Shaolin monk martial art...but they won't teach him.  Why he needs to learn it I don't know because when he first comes to the monastery he kicks a bunch of monk butt but anyways.  Our woebegone servant is paired up with a lazy cook whom he constantly beats up even though he gets the monk to teach him some martial arts.  The monk really doesn't know them and teaches him some fake martial foolery.  Still doesn't matter a whole lot because manservant dude is still a better fighter than most he comes across.  In the end the wicked king gets his, but it's not at the avenging brother's hands.

This movie is so bad that you'll laugh despite yourself, and that gets it one extra star.  But if you're hoping for a seriously good kung fu flick then thank the ""Shaolin Warrior"" to be on his peaceful way and just keep walking!",1413331200,,1508,4.509225092250922

6016672,1,B00FPNQHWW,Worst purchase I have made so far.  This was not even interesting no real storyline and the product was just terrible..,1391385600,3,119,4.666666666666667
6016673,1,B00FPNQHWW,"This is the worst and unrealistic Shaolin martial arts movie I have ever seen. The trailer or preview is misleading: a warrior king that eats human flesh? Give me a break. Amazon should give me my money back. This movie tries in someways to imitate the ""36 Chamber"" staring Gordon Liu; it's not even close. Don't  waste your money.",1389916800,3,331,4.610169491525424
6016674,1,B00FPNQHWW,"Fu enters the Shaolin Buddhist temple wanting to learn marital arts. He must first learn discipline and the ways of Buddha as well as its laws. As it turns out Fu is a wanted criminal for having attacked the king, who it turns out is not a nice guy.

The dialog is in English. There are attempts at humor and even dark humor that doesn't make the translation. Once I found out the reason behind the crime, it becomes a WTF situation as clearly there is some metaphor or cultural aspect I was missing.

I can't imagine Kung Fu fans fancying this production.",1388793600,3,556,4.388349514563107

6016681,2,B00FPNQHWW,"This is NOT a theatrical movie.  This is a television movie.  This is not meant to have a great deal of action scenes.  People see ""Shaolin"" and ""Warrior,"" and they immediately think this is an action flick and theatrical quality.  No, this is a tv movie with a fable storyline about a guy who wants to right himself by going to the Shaolin temple to learn the highest and most powerful kung-fu, or at least that's what he portrays himself as when he arrived at the temple.  The monks sympathized with his begging and suffering to join the monastery believing him in good fate that he would do good with the kung-fu he learns.  However, it turns out that the government police force is looking for him, and the questions are: Who is this guy?  A criminal?  A bad guy?  A spy?  A killer?  A kung-fu master in disguise?

The acting here is very basic and the ending is predictable once you know the storyline, but that is pretty much what a fable is, to teach you a lesson.  The lesson of course is to always be good.  In Shaolin, kung-fu is learned to be good people and to defend the good.  The policy of the Shaolin temple is to never get political or get into the government's business.  So, often when government officials have to intrude, the Shaolin temple must choose a course of action that is as neutral as possible, and that is not an easy task.",1445472000,,1354,4.377510040160643

6016693,2,B00FPNQHWW,"You know sometimes things happen right in front of you and you go, ""what just happened?""  The movie was kind of like that, I don't think I really have a good grasp on what actually went down in this movie.  I mean I understand the story, sure, it was just odd.  I'd liken it to your average fast food, it fills you up, but never satisfies you.  Which makes it sounds like 80s Hollywood action movie, but no, it's worse.  I mean, think BigMac back then and BigMac today.  Don't exactly know what happened, but BigMac then was way way better than BigMac now.",1442188800,,556,4.298076923076923
