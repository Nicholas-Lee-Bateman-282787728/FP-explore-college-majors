5679947,5,B00BX8A8UK,"When I was eight years old, I got a hi-fi for my birthday.  Up until then, I'd used my mother's. She told me I could have any 5 of her LPs to start my own collection.. She goofed. THE FIRST ONE I CHOSE was the soundtrack for ""King Creole"".  Fifty years later, I still have it as well as a CD copy which is the one I usually play.  Even now, I can still remember the lyrics ...
I had not yet seen the movie, nor would I for another 5 or 6 years, but by then I knew all the songs and the plot line.  This was my first glimpse of Vic Morrow. His performance as a punk hood influenced every other role I saw him play; NOT his fault that I hated his guts from then on. He played that punk to perfection! Carolyn Jones as a moll?!  Morticia Adams?! No?! ... Yes. And classy, too.
Dean Jagger, Dolores Hart - a solid cast.  Walter Matthau looked like he didn't want to be in the picture, but maybe that was just my impression.
FYI: The other four LPS picked were: 2 by Frank Sinatra, 1 by Buddy Holly and a Jerry Lee Lewis. Odd choices for an eight-year-old in 1962, but my Grandfather took me to a record store for a few more rock-and-roll LPs.  Thanks, Grandpap!  I still have them ... along with about 350 more.",1381449600,2,1207,4.02092050209205

Danny works at a nightclub before he goes to school. Today is his last day and his family is looking forward to him graduating tomorrow.
 His father is trying to get a job while Danny is just trying to keep his job.
As Danny arrives at his workplace in the morning, four people including Ronnie (Carolyn Jones) have stayed up all night there. As Danny tries to clean up, the gang wants him to sing. He does. The men get rough and so Danny breaks some glasses to defend himself. He helps Ronnie get out of there and into a taxi. Danny is on his way to school. When one of the students makes fun of Danny arriving with a woman, Danny punches him. The school has decided not to let him graduate tomorrow.

5679970,5,B00BX8A8UK,"Before Elvis emerged from the army with all the rebellion and the danger leached out of him ... before his venal, tasteless management decided that he should play safe by becoming a vanilla commodity ... King Creole gave him one chance to show what he could achieve as a unique combination of bad boy, rock idol, and, yes, serious actor. In conventional acting terms, he doesn't do a whole lot in this movie, yet somehow his presence dominates every scene. His personal magnetism was so intense, the emotion is perpetually on the point of bursting out of him.

The low point for me is the music, already betraying his roots. Contrived for the New Orleans setting, which in turn was presumably considered necessary to excuse or justify the amorality that pervades the story, dixieland was never a comfortable match for the talent who sang numbers such as ""Hound Dog"" or ""Shake, Rattle, and Roll"" in a kind of barely controlled frenzy, with perfect counterpoint from Scotty Moore's savage guitar licks. Scotty is visible in this movie, but barely audible, and the songs were already making a transition toward white pop as opposed to black R&B, with dixieland trumpet grafted on.

Still, you can fast-forward through the music where necessary, and relish the classic moments, from the slightly astonishing opening where Elvis trades quips with the whores in a bordello across the street, to the classic exchange: ""What do you want from life, Danny?"" to which he answers, ""A pink convertible.""

Knife fights, '57 cars with tail fins, a beautiful sister in love with the only honest club owner on Bourbon Street, a heist that goes horribly wrong, a deadbeat dad, a getaway that turns into a tragedy, a failed attempt at seduction in a sleazy hotel with a good girl who loves the kid whose high-school principal brands him a hoodlum ... what else could you want from a movie? Throughout it all, Elvis radiates danger, anguish, hope, and of course hot, quivering sex. An amazing achievement.",1415577600,4,1985,4.884272997032641
5679971,5,B00BX8A8UK,It is so sad that Elvis did not get chance to be a serious actor he really is quite goo .I like this movie a lot,1414540800,,112,3.3461538461538463

5679973,5,B00BX8A8UK,"Reportedly, this was Elvis Presley's favorite movie that he starred in.  It is a compelling story about a young kid who fails out of high school for the second time and against his will gets involved with a local New Orleans mob boss, Maxie Fields.  He just tries to help out his family financially by singing, but Maxie is determined to get his tentacles on Danny Fischer (the boy Elvis portrays) and won't stop at anything to do so, including nearly killing Danny's Dad.  I'm not a fan of rock n' roll music and find it a shame that Elvis wasted his beautiful voice on ""songs"" that are more rhythm based than melodic, however, I was quite taken by the intro. to the movie.  The crawfish song is by far the best one and Elvis' voice mixed with the street vendor's voice is most compelling.  So much so, that I've watched that one opening scene several times.  The movie has several of the leading stars of the day and the director directed Casablanca, so it is a quality film.  Albeit a bit long.  It is actually fairly clean, even.",1411257600,,1033,4.428571428571429
