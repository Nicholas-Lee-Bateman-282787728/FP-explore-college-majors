No wonder there was little info on were/ when this concert was shot. The back cover has the same pic's as Soundstage disk too. I'm thinking, I'll return the item.",1310601600,22,317,4.578947368421052

BUT unlike the previous edition on Blu Ray ...this has some songs that were dropped from it so this is the preferred edition.

If you have the Sound Stage show on regular DVD you have this show..its 105 minutes.

I would have given it 4 stars because the other Blu Ray by Foreigner&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rockin-at-the-Ryman-Blu-ray/dp/B004KO2EVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rockin at the Ryman [Blu-ray</a>]
beats this hands down....while the shows are similar the other Blur Ray has 4 songs from THIS show as a bonus, along with three very well produced recent music Videos AND a couple of interviews with Mick and Kelly. What keeps this at 5 stars is the very low price I paid Amazon for it....so value for money they even out in my opinion...and I'm glad to have both!

by the way ...both shows were shot in widescreen and HD so they both look amazing!",1310515200,41,929,5.18
4470559,4,B004USUOUO,"I had to do a follow up on the last rating to give my point of view. I'm a foreigner fan at heart from the first vinyl lp to the Lou Gramm solos and Shadow King CDs. I have seen them live in concert in the '70, `80s and `90s. Their latest CD ""Can't Slow Down"" is a rock classic cd that doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Kelly Hanson vocal is hauntingly like Lou Grams and is the soul mate for the new Foreigner. I didn't come to this conclusion by the new CD, but after seeing Foreigner in concert last year. They were the headliner along with Styx and Steve Winwood. I went to it this concert just to hear Steve Winwood and his classic music, Mr. Winwood totally let me down by not doing any of his early solo lps. Foreigner then took the stage after a great hour set of Styx and it wasn't until about the third song until the music started to kick-in; weaving their newest CD selections with the older classic. I have to say that it was the best concert musically that I've been to date. Lou Gram has move in another direction with his music and I respect that, but Kelly Hanson could have not been a better match vocally for Foreigner.
  If you haven't figured out by now that Mick Jones' writing and producing IS Foreigner and you only know half the story. The music, the sound and the energy, it's all there with the new Foreigner and for three decades, they are still making great Rock `N Roll for us ""the classic rockers"" and the new generation.

4470560,3,B004USUOUO,"Notes on the performances in a moment, but BE WARNED that this is the current Foreigner lineup with Kelly Hansen on vocals rather than the classic Lou Gramm lineup.
Of course we still get to see some electrifying guitar work by Mick Jones, including some fine solos, and many of the hits are here (ex., Double Vision & I Wanna Know What Love Is).  Hansen gives it the ol' college try, but IMO he will never be that good of a replacement for Gramm.  As far as the replacements for classic rock bands go, Hansen doesn't quite rank with Pineda in Journey or even Tommy DeCarlo in Boston.",1310083200,4,584,4.398148148148148

The ancillary guitarist and keyboardist also perform admirably and the entire band smokes through all of the hits that any Foreginer fan would want to hear plus, there is also one new song performed.

  I saw the ""Live at the Ryman"" performance on satellite TV and I have to say that this title is better. There are also apparently regional coding issues with the Ryman performance for North American purchasers. This performance is more polished as well (musically and light show, too).
 Of course, you can't please everyone with the songlist, but as a longtime fan of Foreigner, I have to say that the choices do satisfy.

I pulled the DVD and moved to the better sound system. Mick Jones and Kelly Hansen were CRUSHING it. They did so the rest of ther DVD.

It was ALL good. Mick was solid all the way through. Kelly was fantastic. His energy was awesome. His voice was perfect. Sounded just like the original. His crowd interaction was phenomenal. Jason Bonham was a SCORE; no idea how they got him.

Playlist was perfect. This is going to be one of those DVDs that I watch till it wears out and I like the music MORE because of this DVD.

I had a free evening on Friday and decided it was ""concert night"".  I adjusted the room lighting and reached behind the sub woofer to advance the volume control to maximum and then backed it off a few ticks just for maintaining peace and tranquility within the home environment.  I poured myself a generous portion of Kentucky Bourbon for sippin' and inserted the Foreigner Blu-ray disc in the player.

I set the audio to the DTS mode and made necessary adjustments to the AV/receiver for 7.1 surround.  I hit play and was immediately overwhelmed with a powerful audio signal that was strong and clear.  Each instrument and vocal was well defined with none over shadowing another.  I was totally impressed as I sat back, sipped and relaxed while enjoying a well produced concert.  I never considered Foreigner one of my top bands but was impressed as I remembered each song as the concert proceeded.  I really enjoyed their acoustic and vocals version of ""Say You Will"".  It was one that stuck with me several days just running through my mind's virtual music track.

I have most all of the tracks from the concert on vinyl stashed away in old fruit crates in the basement but the AV mode of listening and watching will keep the vinyl as just fond keepsakes.  The ""Sound Stage"" format has been releasing some pretty decent concert discs recently.  I will watch this Blu-ray concert many times in weeks to come.",1339718400,6,1629,4.591695501730104

4470676,5,B004USUOUO,This DVD is a re-packaging of the SoundStage show filmed in Chicago.  The quality of the audio and video is excellent.  Highly recommended.,1323993600,,139,5.0
4470677,5,B004USUOUO,"This tight and powerful performance by Foreigner is from an appearance on the Soundstage program probably recorded in 2007.  Led by guitarist Mick Jones, and featuring Kelly Hansen on vocals, the 16 song concert runs about 104 minutes, with a setlist that contains most of their most popular and well-known hits.  It's a dynamic performance, with plenty of variety.  The DVD is well produced and edited.  As the lighting levels onstage are generally high, the image quality of the Bluray is simply fabulous.  The stage is quite large and relatively free of visual obstructions, providing some excellent views of the band, who are literally just a few feet away from the audience.

Founded by Jones and vocalist Lou Gramm, Foreigner burst on the scene in 1977, and soon became one of the hottest rock bands of the late 70's, with a string of radio friendly hits that ran from rockers to power ballads.  Foreigner was a versatile group that drew fans from various demographics.  While able to rock hard, the band gradually moved in a softer a more melodic direction during the 1980's, displaying solid songwriting, and an affinity for incorporating catchy melodies and keyboards.

Gramm left the band in the late 80's to pursue a solo career, while Mick Jones pushed on with Foreigner.  Though Gramm returned to Foreigner for a time, he eventually departed again.  Fortunately, Kelly Hansen's voice is remarkably similar to Gramm's.  It's amazing how great Foreigner sounds with Hansen singing.  The vocalist seems quite youthful for 46, and brings great energy to the band.  Completing Foreigner's lineup are Jason Bonham (UFO, Bonham) on drums, Jeff Pilson (Dokken, Dio) on bass, Michael Bluestein on keyboards, and multitalented Tom Gimbel on guitar, saxophone, and flute.

Foreigner gets things started with Night Life, with Hansen prancing around the stage, looking a bit like Steven Tyler, almost immediately establishing rapport with the audience.  The band then takes a firm grip on the crowd, powering through the hits Head Games, Cold As Ice, and the melodic magic of Waiting For A Girl Like You.

Too Late, is the only new song in the set, and it's a pretty darn catchy tune.  It would later be included on their album Can't Slow Down, released in 2009.  The band then turns it down, for an acoustic version of Say You Will, that really showcases Hansen's voice, with ample backing vocals from the rest of the band.  It's definitely a warm, feel good time.

The band cranks it up, blasting through classic material from their first four albums, including Long Long Way From Home, Double Vision, Feels Like The First Time, and the raucous Elvis Presley tribute, Dirty While Boy.  Definite high points are Mick Jones singing lead on the spacey Starrider, and Tommy Gimbel's inspired sax playing on an ultra sexy version of Urgent.  Juke Box Hero is a funky improvisational vehicle for the band, where they pay homage to Led Zeppelin.  Foreigner finishes the performance with a killer version of Hot Blooded, showing that there is still a lot of life in this band, and that their music proudly stands the test of time.

While replacing a singer with the talent of Lou Gramm was a huge challenge, in Kelly Hansen, Foreigner has clearly hit the jackpot, as the singer breathes new life into all the classic tunes, while putting his own personal stamp on the songs.  The band's lineup has continued to change since this performance, but as long as Mick Jones is around, the heart of Foreigner will continue to beat strongly.

If you are a fan of Foreigner from the Hansen era, this Bluray disc is highly recommended.  Sound options are DTS-MA 5.1 Surround Sound, and LPCM Stereo.  Unfortunately there are no extra features.  This same Soundstage performance has apparently been previously been released on DVD, but the Bluray's superior image quality may make the upgrade worthy of consideration.",1323820800,,3899,4.944700460829493
4470678,5,B004USUOUO,I saw Foreigner live two months ago and loved them!  I was nervous about them having a new lead singer but absolutely fell in love with him.

4470679,4,B004USUOUO,Great concert. Well done DVD as well. Great sound recording and the video is very well done. Foreigner stands with the greats!,1317168000,,126,4.7727272727272725
4470680,5,B004USUOUO,"In 1977 a group of musicians came together to form the band Foreigner. Several had been in some major bands in the past including Spooky Tooth and King Crimson, making them one of the first of many ""super bands"" as groups with members in other bands were called. Their initial outing contained several hits and made them a staple on rock radio for years. They've changed line ups over the years but Mick Jones has remained a constant and he still rocks out over 30 years later.

FOREIGNER LIVE features the most current line up for the band in 2008 when this was made. Released before, the DVD is now available in blu-ray format, increasing not just the great picture quality but the sound as well.  When it comes to watching AND listening to this great band perform in 5.1 DTS you'll know that investing in the surround system is well worth doing.

The line up of the band featured here includes Jones, Tom Gimbel who toured with Aerosmith, Jeff Pilson who was one of the original members of Dokken, Michael Bluestein who played with Boz Skaggs and Stevie Nicks, Jason Bonham son of Led Zepplin drummer John Bonham and new lead singer Kelly Hansen. All of them are insanely talented individuals but it is Hansen who pulls off the most amazing thing for any member in the group. That's because Hansen, as lead singer, sounds nearly exactly like original singer Lou Gramm. Face it, the vocals are what make most bands recognizable. To find someone who not only can perform as if he's been there all along but to make the songs sound like they did originally is amazing.

The DVD was part of the SoundStage series that filmed in Chicago and used a standard backdrop with screens displaying the name of the featured guest. Add to that the lights the band uses and the fact that they don't rely on the props but more on their musical ability and you have a dynamite DVD. What amazed me most was that while I thought I was a so so fan of the group, I found that there were more songs I liked by them than I realized. It made me want to dig out the greatest hits CD to listen to while driving!

The set list for the DVD is as follows, featuring all the great hits of the band and one new original song:

1. Night Life
2. Head Games
3. Gold As Ice
4. Waiting for a Girl Like You
5. Too Late
6. Say You Will
7. Long, Long Way From Home
8. Double Vision
9. Blue Morning, Blue Day
10. Dirty White Boy
11. Starrider
12. Feels Like the First Time
13. Urgent
14. Juke Box Hero
15. I Want to Know What Love Is
16. Hot Blooded

Two songs have always been special to me among the hits by Foreigner. The first was ""Juke Box Hero"", a song that captured the dream of every young man who ever had the desire to be a rock star, and face it we all did at one time or another. The story of a young man who can't see the show but listens outside and does everything he can to make it to the top is storytelling at its best from someone inside the world being sung about.

The second was ""I Want to Know What Love Is"". Why? Because the day my son was born that was the number one single in the U.S. I even purchased a 45 of the song (remember those?) and enclosed it in the baby book we made for him. It remains there to this day, never played.

Fans of rock music will find this to be a completely entertaining DVD to add to their collection. Those who thought they weren't Foreigner fans will discover that they actually liked more songs than they remembered. And for those who haven't heard them at all, sit back and enjoy one of the great rock bands of all time.",1313366400,20,3541,4.234074074074074
