8714676,4,B00WZX3PPW,"Given a lack of reviews of this product (Amazon or elsewhere, at least to my knowledge), I felt compelled to record a few thoughts. Amazon's guidance notes for 3 stars indicate ""It's OK"", with 4 stars interpreted as ""I like it"". This helped me decide on the 4-star rating.

I found this to be a well-priced issue (I purchased from an alternate source) with committed performances (worthy of repeated listening/viewing) and with solid production value (both video and sound have excellent clarity). I believe most people would be pleased to own this set - from the most seasoned aficionados, to those just seeking a good concert experience from the comfort of home.

First a technical comment: the product title (at the time of my review) is incorrectly listed as a Blu-ray. Please note that this is a 2-DVD set, and has not been released on Blu-ray from any source.

On the musical side: Full disclosure that I do find it somewhat more difficult to objectively rate video performances versus audio recordings. I find that the visual component draws me into a performance more readily. However, I can state with confidence that these are well-thought out, well rehearsed, and very committed performances. The musicians are focused, but also appear to be enjoying themselves. The long-term relationship between conductor and orchestra is obvious. In this case, Zacharias acts as both conductor and soloist.

Likely attributable (at least in part) to the lack of conductor, there is a chamber-music ""give-and-take"" feel throughout these performances. Particularly in the Emperor concerto (No. 5), this materializes in a performance containing many different tempi (the tempo shifts almost with every new theme!). Thankfully, this issue is not as prevalent in the other concerti. I will acknowledge that the tempi changes do seem to suit the musical content, and perhaps not everyone would find this as distracting as I did. For me, however, this has been my most significant reservation with the set.

I would describe the strings as lush-sounding - although it is a chamber orchestra, I have not experienced a sensation of thinness in the sound. Rather, I have found there to be sufficient Beethovenian weight in the performances, but with clarity of lines and textures. The winds cut through prominently, with excellent performances given by all. The soloist matches the clarity of the orchestra, never losing sight of articulation, phrasing, and overall line. I find Zacharias' performances to be full of grace, poise, commitment ...tending more toward ""romanticism"" than ""classicism"".

All in all, very enjoyable concert performances. For my taste, I found this DVD set to be a more attractive option than the current Blu-ray competition (Buchbinder; Barenboim). I am relatively unfamiliar with Buchbinder as a soloist (perhaps my loss!) ...and I have found prior video performances by Barenboim a little visually distracting (just personal taste, although I respect his performances). I also read somewhere that he is constantly wiping sweat from his brow during his Beethoven concerti Blu-ray cycle. Price (from my source) was also a consideration, with the Zacharias DVD's costing nearly 25% less than the Blu-ray alternatives. I will, however, continue to monitor future Blu-ray releases as selection will no doubt increase with time. In the interim, I am more than pleased with these performances and have already watched each performance multiple times.

To help others understand the context from which I have evaluated these DVD's, my audio collection includes Beethoven concerti cycles by Andsnes, Arrau, Bronfman, Lill, Perahia, Shelley, and Zimerman. I also have individual concerto performances by Argerich, Brautigam, van Cliburn, Douglas, Katsaris, Kovacevich, Pires, Schoonderwoerd, and Sudbin.",1436659200,,3810,5.361204013377926
