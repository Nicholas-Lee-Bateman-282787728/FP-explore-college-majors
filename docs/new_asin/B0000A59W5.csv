1902252,5,B0000A59W5,"For me, this is a great workout. For my pcos and my body type, I have to focus more on walking and only do core work or muscle trainging 2x a week and for that, this workout is great. I get to walk it out and its not complicated, I can either do 1 mile or 2 miles, or combine to make 3 or 4 miles. I highly recommend leslie sansone. It gets you sweating without breaking your back.",1199059200,6,381,3.8354430379746836
1902253,5,B0000A59W5,"i've used this dvd for over 2 months.  it is a great workout..no silly aerobic steps, easy to follow.  the stretchie band helps break up the walking and helps your upper body.  you can buy similar stretchies in a 3 strenght pack at K-Mart if your dvd doesn't include one.  you really can't miss with the one!",1175817600,11,308,4.350877192982456
1902254,5,B0000A59W5,"I LOVE Leslie Sansone's Express exercise series - I think they are her best exercise videos to date.  The 1 Mile Express is the best way to get started if you haven't been physically active; or, if you have been ill and need to rebuild your strength. No complicated steps to learn, just 4 basic steps.  Her goal is to keep you moving, not teach you steps.  She tells you at the start that it's your walk and you are in charge, if a step doesn't feel right for you then just go back to walking in place.  Very little space is needed, which is another bonus. If you have a few feet of clear floor space that's all you need.  She begins with a warm up, then increases the pace, followed by use of a stretchy band to strengthen your arms, and then slows the pace to cool down, followed by a light stretch.  I find the 20 minute, one mile workout, is perfect for those days when I come home from work tired, but still want a light workout.  The 30 minute, two mile workout, is great for weekends and is more of a challenge for those who find the one mile too easy, tho it is the same basic routine, just a faster pace and a little longer.  My father, who is still rebuilding his strength from an earlier stoke is able to join me on the one mile workout.  My mother, who has had two knee replacements, watched the video and said 'I can do that' and is considering joining us, tho we will probably have her hold on to a walker for better balance initially.  Regardless of your age, you need to get moving to get healthy and this is a great way to get started!",1171065600,41,1552,4.1262458471760795
1902255,5,B0000A59W5,"this cd is great! for those of you who don't like to exercise, this tape will  help you succeed in your work-out methods. as soon as you feel you can't do another leg lift, or arm stretch, leslie goes back to walking. it's as if she knows when you're getting tired and will take you back to walking. it's great for beginners or for those of us who slacked up; it's a good jumpstart and very low impact. this is the easiest form of exercise i've done,yet i still feel the burn so i know it's working. you won't mind doing this and the best thing about it is that you can do it in the privacy of your own home, office, etc, and it's over in 30 minutes. by the time you get into it it's over! buy it! it's worth it!",1168300800,9,712,3.979020979020979
1902256,4,B0000A59W5,"This DVD contains two express walking programs, the 1 Mile ""Easy Walk"" and the 2 Mile ""Brisk Walk.""  Both programs utilize a strechie band to work on upper body strengthening as you walk.  The Easy Walk program contains about 16 minutes of walking followed by a 2 minute stretch.  The walking part includes Leslie's 4 basic steps--walk (march), side step, front kick, and knee up--and spends some time at a brisker pace; the band is used for just a few exercises in the second half mile.  The Brisk Walk program involves 29 minutes of walking followed by 3 minutes of stretching.  You'll spend longer time at a greater intensity and do a bit more with the band, but again, the band is only used for the second half of the workout.  These are nice programs that are particularly ideal for those short on time and wanting to mix in some light strength training with their cardio workouts.  Also, the Easy Walk would be especially appropriate for beginners, but even more advanced exercisers will still work up a sweat.  Highly recommended.",1118361600,16,1037,4.722222222222222
1902257,4,B0000A59W5,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift from my walking partner. I wondered how interesting can a walking program DVD be?

I was pleased to find that Leslie Sansone's walking program was not only interesting, providing enough variations in movement to keep boredom from setting in, but when choosing the ""brisk walk"" I got a great cardio workout as well.

This is a good starter workout, simple enough for the most sedentary couch potato to follow -- allowing you to adapt the workout to your ability and comfort level. It's also a good DVD for avid walkers who want an option to be able to take their walk indoors when the weather doesn't permit a stroll outdoors.

However, if you're looking for a HEAVY cardio workout, this DVD probably isn't for you.

Even in the land of the sun and surf, Mother Nature doesn't always cooperate. When she doesn't -- reach for the ""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" DVD and go for a walk indoors!",1104019200,14,929,4.578313253012048
1902258,5,B0000A59W5,I bought the 2-in-1 DVD Walk Away the Pounds Express on Nov. 23 and have been using it since then everyday.  I usually do the 1-mile twice in a roll.  I have also tried the 2-mile.  I really like them since it's so easy to follow.  It's not vigorous but enough to get you moving.  I think it's a good start for anyone who's trying to get into a routine.  I've read many good reviews and I have to agree with them.  It's a wonderful tool and I highly recommend it.,1069891200,30,463,4.021978021978022

I bought the five mile belly blasting dvd and after reviewing this one I'm positive that one is going to be the intense level I need.

1902338,5,B0000A59W5,"""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" features two walking exercise programs: a one-mile ""Easy Walk"" and a two-mile ""Brisk Walk"". Both walks are led by Leslie Sansone and she has a group of walkers with her. Each walk incorporates the Stretchie Band (although you can do the exercises without the band).

""Easy Walk""

The ""Easy Walk"" is a very quick (approximately 18 minutes) but very effective exercise routine.  It features all of Leslie's regular moves: the four basic steps (walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts) as well as kick backs (hamstring curls).  You exercise at a pace of nine minutes for each half-mile. The Stretchie Band adds just the right bit of intensity to make this a challenging walk when you are short on time. You start using the Stretchie Band about 13 minutes in and you use it for about three minutes - it sort of serves as the cool down period. You use the Stretchie Band twice both in front of you and around your waist.  Finally, there is a nice stretch sequence at the end (about two minutes).

""Brisk Walk""

The ""Brisk Walk"" is a two-mile walk that takes about 32 minutes from start to finish - each mile is about 15 minutes long.  Again, Leslie uses her four basic steps and kick backs, but adds some upper body moves (reach your hands over your head and pull them down again) and some movement - (walk forward and back while doing knee lifts) and balance and coordination (put one hand out while kicking with the opposite leg) that aren't included in the one mile walk. While this is a nice invigorating workout, Leslie does not incorporate some of the vigorous routines she does in other two-mile walks. For example, she only does single side steps no double side steps and only single knee lifts rather than double or even four knee lifts at a time.  The Stretchie Band does add a nice bit of intensity to the workout. You use it about 21 minutes in and use it for about six minutes (with some breaks in between). Again you use it twice in front of you and twice around your waist. It is a nice segment and I could definitely feel the results afterwards.

""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" is a nice workout DVD by Leslie Sansone and the Stretchie Band adds a nice boost to both the one-mile and two-mile walks.",1300233600,11,2250,4.506142506142506
1902349,5,B0000A59W5,"This DVD is a little tame for me, but I don't think I'm the target audience.  Leslie Sansone's walking program is geared toward people who either haven't exercised in awhile or who have physical difficulties entering a strenuous exercise program.  Her exercises are very clear and very easy to figure out.  She herself is very encouraging and comes off as caring about you as a person, which is a refreshing change from a lot of exercise DVDs.  There are some exercises that are done with an exercise band, but one doesn't need to have an exercise band to get something out of this DVD.  In all, this was a very pleasant DVD with a personable host and catchy music.  Even though I barely broke a sweat after both the one mile and two mile walks, I felt invigorated when I was done.

Leslie is a very motivating ""workout partner."" Just keep focused on her upbeat personality and her encouragement and before you know it, you will be at the cool down part. It comes quickly if you don't over-work yourself. If you work too hard, you will not be able to finish the workout. She will tell you on the video that you can slow down whenever you need to. The key is to *try* to keep moving. This is perfect for people who don't want to get frustrated by tricky dance moves. For people who like dancing, they can easily add their own flare to the simple moves. The workouts are also doable for people who have limited space to work out in.",1284249600,3,809,4.259740259740259

1902355,5,B0000A59W5,"Time goes by quickly and you'll really enjoy this workout. Leslie really believes in what she's doing and so will you. While I'll admit all her videos are pretty much the same, each one has a uniqueness. This walk goes by fast. You can use the stretch band, which adds lots of fun to the workout and helps you burn more calories. I use the Dynaband I already had. I think you can pretty much use any sort of band you want but one made like Dynaband is best.

This is one of my favorite workouts. I don't like aerobics and I lift weights as my main workout. But to lose weight and get my cardio, I love a walk with Leslie.

Highly recommended.

1902357,5,B0000A59W5,I love this DVD!  I have tried several Walk Away the Pounds workouts and this one is my favorite so far.  I was first introduced to the Walk Away the Pounds workouts several years ago while trying to lose weight after having my first child.  I started with the 1 mile and worked my way up to the 2 mile.  Unfortunately I slacked off on exercise (and gained weight back) for a few years in there... but have recently started back up with this DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could start off with the 2 mile DVD and I can already tell a difference in my ability to get through the DVD after less than 2 weeks back with the program.  What I love most about this DVD is that it is simple and it is geared towards everyone.  There are walkers of all ages and varying body shapes.  The DVD only uses 4 simple steps -- no aerobics or complicated dance moves for me to figure out (or give up on!).  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get started with an exercise program and fit a quick workout (either 15 or 30 minutes) into a busy day.,1263427200,3,1063,4.096618357487923
1902358,5,B0000A59W5,"I would recommend this DVD for any couch potatoes out there (like me) who have bought a million DVD workouts and haven't been able to finish any of them more than a few times (if at all). The movements are VERY simple (marching in place, doing an occasional grapevine step). If you are overweight, have knee or back problems, or are just looking for an easy workout to get you on the right track, this is the one. People of all ages can do this one too--one of the participants is a 70 year old man. Seriously. Buy this DVD. You'll actually WANT to use it rather than let it collect dust on the shelf.
 There is a segment where the exercises require one of those stretchy arm band things, so you'll need to pick one up if you don't already have one.",1263168000,,749,4.2377622377622375
1902359,5,B0000A59W5,"I am a 40 something obese woman who has not excercised in years. Then a friend gave me this DVD -  I am walking a mile every other day now, and Leslie's video along with a good diet has been wonderful for me.  I have lost 49 pounds since March, 2009, and I have no doubt I am going to lose a lot more. This is a great exercise video you can do in the privacy of your own home and not have to worry about the weather or the dangers sometimes found outside!",1252108800,6,455,3.8297872340425534
1902360,5,B0000A59W5,Love the series & keep loaning out (giving away) the 1 & 2 mile combo to friends & family to try. Excellent service from the person I ordered this dvd from.,1247011200,2,156,4.064516129032258
1902361,5,B0000A59W5,"I have literally dozens have exercise videos. Unfortunately, I rarely actually workout! Several of the DVD's haven't even been opened! But, with this workout, it is easy to exercise. The workout itself will make you sweat. But, it is easy to follow. It is tough to find good excuses for not exercising. It only takes 20-30 minutes. All you really need is a DVD player and stretchie band. If you have never exercised or have not been active for a while, this a wonderful place to start.",1246924800,2,485,4.586206896551724
1902362,5,B0000A59W5,"I like these two walking (actually marching) workouts - perfect for us middle-age (and beyond) non-athletes with desk jobs who want to stay active. The marching is nicely broken up with other lower body moves (all done standing) and some light arm work. I have room for all the moves in my very small living room. Some of the arm work is done with a stretchy band, but you can do the moves without those if you like.",1245888000,5,416,4.346153846153846
1902363,4,B0000A59W5,"This DVD has one good workout and one so-so workout. I found the 1 mile walk to be too tame, especially compared to a Sansone tape I've had for years (1 mile super calorie burn). This might be ok for someone who is just starting an exercise program, but for anyone else it's best to skip it and go directly to the 2 mile walk.

I found the 2 mile walk to give a great workout. It's strenuous enough to make you feel you've really exercised, but not so strenuous you're a limp rag afterwards. My only gripes with the tape are the long lead-ins (I fast forward) and Sansone's tendency to silliness. Still, worth the $.",1245801600,4,616,4.264957264957265
1902364,5,B0000A59W5,I am very impressed with the routine of the walking. I suffer from OA in both knees and the EasyWalk was low impact for me to do. I told my husband that I could walk without going outside the house and if I got tired I could sit down on the bed and rest (LOL),1241049600,2,259,3.727272727272727
1902365,5,B0000A59W5,This was one of my first Leslie workouts. I have been doing it since Sept. '08 and still love it. I combine it with other Leslie workouts to get 5 miles a day,1240444800,2,158,3.8181818181818183
1902366,5,B0000A59W5,I found this video at my library & fell in love; I knew it had to be part of my permanent collection.  This video offers two varying level exercise programs (15 or 30 mins) and really works out the entire body.  I love to take the 30 mins and get a quick toning exercise.,1239494400,2,271,4.0
1902367,5,B0000A59W5,Makes a 72-year-old glad to get back to walking along with our TOPS Club.  Easy to follow along and keep up with her telling you what is coming up next as she goes along. Not a dance routine but a walking routine for all kinds of weather.  No excuse not to walk.  Good warm up and buildup to a good walking session and gradual cool down with stretching at the end.  Feels great when finished.,1238284800,5,392,4.1866666666666665
1902368,5,B0000A59W5,"I bought this dvd to ease into a regular workout routine. This dvd is great for beginners because the 1 mile workout is simple, straight forward, and fairly easy. Leslie Sansone is very motivating in the workout and the music helps keep you going.
I usually do the 2 mile workout (takes about 30 minutes total) every other day and on the other days I do a more intense workout using the Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred dvd. Together, the workouts have helped me lose weight and start a healthy lifestyle.",1235606400,4,503,4.538461538461538
1902379,5,B0000A59W5,"I think this video is great, it starts out very easy for those of us who are completely out of shape. It builds up gradually which I really liked.",1234051200,2,146,4.068965517241379
1902380,5,B0000A59W5,"I have been using this DVD for years, and I just love it.  I am easily annoyed by bouncy or overly aggressive aerobics chicks and Leslie is so easy to watch and workout with.  I like that she uses REAL people in her videos and doesn't make you feel like a loser for not weighing 90 pounds.  I am not overweight, but I have used this to keep in great shape - the cardio upkeep and strength it builds in my legs is awesome.  Very low impact.  I am currently six months pregnant and still do the 2 mile walk about 3 times a week and have no problem keeping up.  I modify on the days I don't feel quite up for giving it my all, and it's still a great little workout.  I enjoy that you can make this easy or difficult simply by changing your range of motion and decision to incorporate weights.  I think anyone who is sick of over the top aerobics routines where you are just trying not to fall down doing a million difficult maneuvers should buy this video!!",1233619200,3,954,4.118918918918919
1902381,5,B0000A59W5,"This is my 2nd copy of this DVD.  I left the other one in a DVD somewhere!  She is very pleasant and encouraging and I feel there is enough variety to make the 20 or 30 minutes go by quickly.  Probably not high intensity enough for hard-core exercisers, but for those who want to get their walk in, especially in cold weather, this works great.  Doesn't require much floor space.  I highly recommend.",1231200000,5,400,4.424657534246576
1902382,5,B0000A59W5,"I am very picky about walking DVD's and I spent over an hour just picking this one out. I like the fact that it gives you a quick One Mile and then a Brisk 2 Mile, and on the menu you can choose the walk you want. And like most people, I do not have that much time to work out walking. So I found that this DVD in the ONE MILE takes only 15 minutes! This is a wonderful and easy to do walking DVD. The only thing is that the stretch ribbon is not included, it needs to be ordered separately.  I have done both walks and most of the time, I just have time for the quick one mile walk. This is my second favorite walking DVD. My favorite is the Denise Austin 1 Mile walk DVD as it is fast to do and also easy. However, I alternate the two DVDS for variety. This is a good buy and worth the price, one of the best walking DVD's out there!",1229990400,3,835,3.7988505747126435
1902383,5,B0000A59W5,Love it! Easy to follow - no complicated steps to learn. Quick mile work out. I haven't done the 2 mile yet but from my experience with the 1 mile I feel confident that I can do it when I am ready to progress.,1229817600,5,209,3.772727272727273
1902384,5,B0000A59W5,I've been using this workout to get back in shape after having a c-section. I really like that it is simple - no crazy routines to learn. Walking with some simple upper body work is gentle enough for post surgery and yet effective in getting the heart rate up. It's an easy workout to squeeze in and my 2 1/2 year old likes to do it with me while the baby naps! I'm very happy with this purchase!,1229558400,3,396,4.089743589743589
1902385,5,B0000A59W5,I have ordered 4 of these DVD's.  The first was for me the others were gifts.  I am well pleased with the quick service as well as the quality of the DVD's. The only thing I would have changed the first time I ordered was if I had known in advance that the stretch bands were not included.  The DVD calls for the use of one but they were not in the deal.,1229212800,2,354,3.8219178082191783
1902386,5,B0000A59W5,"This is a great DVD for a nice, quick workout.  I am definately an amateur at exercise and I really like this one!  It is very motivating, I can feel a little sweat build up and the one mile goes by really quick.  I haven't tried the 2 mile yet but there is that option to kick it up a notch.  It also takes very little floor space to do so I can do this in my bedroom.  I highly recommend this one!",1228780800,3,399,3.7590361445783134

What I love about this DVD is the fact that I get a great workout in a short amount of time!  The 2-Mile Brisk Walk is the one I do and it is great for an intermediate/advanced exerciser like me.  I am 52 years old and have lost 43 pounds thanks to Leslie Sansone and her wonderful walking programs.  I keep adding more and more of her DVDs to my collection - this is my reward for eating healthier and exercising at least 6 days/week!  Thank you, Leslie!!!",1221091200,3,635,4.032

I started out with the 1 mile walk, now starting with the 2. I also have degenerative dics disease and a couple bulging discs, and this is not hurting me at all. I love it, find it very inspirational and energizing. I recommend this highly to anyone that has been a couch potato for too long and wants to get going again.",1206748800,8,457,4.264367816091954

My hip joints have really improved and I'm feeling much better prepared for a somewhat challenging trip in 3 weeks. Thank you, Amazon & Leslie Sansone!",1501632000,,335,4.090909090909091
7995849,5,B0000A59W5,"I have several Leslie Sansone's walk videos.  I like to change up the videos and switch from time to time, and this is one of my favorites.  I have videos where she walks with a group and others where she is solo. This one is with a group, and I find it makes the time seem to go faster.  I think Leslie's walking workouts truly do provide a good cardio and overall workout without being overly taxing on the legs and knees.  You do sweat, and you do feel it afterwards, but that is all good!  This video is done with a group and there are two separate workouts (1 mile and a 2 mile).  I was pleased that each workout is complete with warm up and cool down, so that you don't have to scan or switch the DVD to find the warm up in a separate segment (as in some other DVD's that I have).  My favorite is still the original Walk Away the Pounds.  This one does not use weights, but does use the stretchy bands (not included with this purchase) for a short period...........however you don't have to use stretchy bands, and it is still a good workout.  I like the upbeat music on this video.  The walking pace is a little bit faster than the original Walk Away the Pounds, but still doable.  Not as much arm work with this one as in the original Walk Away the Pounds.  I normally do 2 miles a day, but its nice to have the 1 mile workout for days when you are rushed or just not feeling up to it for whatever reason.  Overall, a very good workout that is doable......which is why you will stick with it!",1498435200,2,1500,4.11340206185567

It's one of her older workouts, but recently I have been favoring her older workouts, especially all of the Walk Away the Pounds series.  I highly recommend this for beginners and for those who have a lot of weight to lose.  I have been doing the 1 mile every day.  And it's great to have the 2 mile on the same DVD when I'm ready for a bigger challenge.  This is a great way to start an exercise program.
