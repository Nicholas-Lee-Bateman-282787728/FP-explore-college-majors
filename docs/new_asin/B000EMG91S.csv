2522352,5,B000EMG91S,"A gently metaphysical comedy with irresistible work by Karl Bowman, Geraldine McEwan, and the (occasionally changing) supporting cast. If Garrison Keillor were British and writing teleplays, you might get Mulberry -- and perhaps would have gotten more episodes of this too-brief series.

Note: For years I've been begging my local PBS affiliate to re-run this sweet-natured British series -- not only have I not seen it for years, I MISSED THE FINAL EPISODE. I'm not sure you can imagine just how happy I am to see this available for (pre-)order. Thank you, thank you, thank you BBC! Oh, I'm going to be humming that theme song for the next month...)",1148428800,16,650,4.909090909090909
2522353,5,B000EMG91S,"I caught this show on PBS many years ago and found it thoroughly enjoyable.  I'm so thrilled that this is coming out on DVD!  I find the show to be one I don't mind going back and watching over again.

It's a pity that only two series were made.

Even though it is primarily a comedy show, there are very touching moments and some serious moments.

For me, the only show that is better is the Yes, Minister/Yes, Prime Minister series.",1148169600,12,434,4.308641975308642
2522354,5,B000EMG91S,"One great British cult favorite.  An offbeat comedy nicely described above in the ""Editorial Review""; however, the hook of the series is absurdly given away above in the ""Plot Summery"".

Indeed, this delightful series is about a mysterious stranger (Mulberry) who insinuates himself into the household of the elderly Miss Farnaby.

Mulberry is the surprisingly cheerful son of ""Death"" training for the day he takes over Dad's job.  His father insists that the taking of a life is not a punishment.  ""It's just the way things are.""  However, Mulberry is determined to allow the reclusive and cantankerous Miss Fanaby a chance to enjoy life before completing his assignment.

Slowly in each episode Mulberry draws out Miss Farnaby as well as her two surly servants; and so ironically, the ""Son of Death"" improves everybody's lives.

""Mulberry"" could have been weird, grim and macabre a la ""The Aadams Family"".  Instead, this British gem is quirky, funny and utterly charming.  Despite the fantasy element of death personified ""Mulberry"" is more like the series ""As Time Goes By"" then other fantasy shows like ""My Hero""; the humor on ""Mulberry"" is gentle sometimes bittersweet rather than ironic or absurd.

Recommended if you liked ""On the Up"", ""Waiting for God"" or ""As Time Goes By"".",1146441600,116,1282,5.086124401913875
2522355,5,B000EMG91S,"Mulberry was one of those brilliantly unique television programs that only the Brits seem to be able to do well, or to do at all. It's a quiet and gentle show about death coming to take an elderly woman- and then staying around to make sure she gets a bit of happiness in her life first. Chances are your local cable or PBS station will never carry it, so buying this DVD might be the only chance you ever have to see it.",1145577600,65,421,4.0843373493975905
2522356,5,B000EMG91S,"When Mulberry aired in the U.S.A, it captivated viewers with its unusual premise and the wonderful ensemble acting of the four main characters; Rose Farnaby, Mulberry, Bert and Alice. Geraldine McEwan and Karl Howman had perfect comedy timing and filtered it through a sweetness of spirit and the whole thing was just odd enough to keep the audience guessing about the outcome. There's kite flying, tandem riding, dinner guest dying and nude modelling just for starters. Fans have waited a long time for a DVD release. And PBS - if you're reading... schedule the series again!",1144972800,37,576,5.010416666666667
2522357,5,B000EMG91S,"I first saw this series on public television and was captivated by it's quirky humor. I'm happy to see that it's finally coming out on DVD. I've always wondered how the series ended since the TV reception on our local PBS channel didn't always come in well and I missed the last few episodes. This is a truly funny, sweet series, and one of the few British comedy shows that I really enjoy. (I usually don't get British humor.) I hope this isn't one of those cheap DVD's with no extra's that's hard to navigate. I look forward to recieving the DVD's and finding out.",1144627200,9,566,4.4

Mulberry (Karl Howman)  was charming and silly and Miss Farnaby (Geraldine McEwan) was suitably mannered and crabby..except when she smiled behind the helps back.

2522379,5,B000EMG91S,"I have already watched it several times all the way through. The gentleness of it and yet the in-your-face comedy make this a total delight. How sad that the third series never came to be. Especially when we now know who Mulberry was and what his eventual job was.

Everything was low-key and yet beamed out joy and exuberance while never becoming rude comedy. A joy to watch. Makes me think I should find some other works ""Mulberry"" starred in.",1438387200,,445,4.5625
2522380,5,B000EMG91S,"This is an off the wall British comedy that has you guessing at the start as to who Mulberry truly is.  When you do find out, you understand how he can manage this wall flower spinster.  The plots are a lot of times very heart warming with lots of laughs.  Geraldine McEwan is the perfect spinster with sisters that leave a lot to be desired as siblings.  I highly recommend the Mulberry series as lighthearted entertainment will worth the dollar.",1438041600,,447,4.55
2522381,5,B000EMG91S,"Mulberry never quite got to its foregone conclusion.  With two seasons and just 13 episodes, it still managed to make quite an impression thanks to a brilliant cast.

It's a macabre idea, a junior Grim Reaper bungles his first assignment because he likes her too much and feels, even though elderly, that she hasn't quite go her full enjoyment out of life yet.  He makes it his mission to see to it that she gets to do a little more living before she dies.  Death gives his son until spring and then he has to bring her over.

It's surprising just how cheerful they can make a death sentence seem.  A third season was planned then cancelled.  I'm still deciding if that was a bad thing or a good thing.  This way we can think that Bert, Alice, Mulberry, and Miss Farnaby are still carrying on until eventuality catches up with them.

In Geraldine McEwan's case, sadly, she died on the 30th of January of this year from a stroke.  She remains one of my favorite actresses.",1435795200,4,971,4.435028248587571

2522400,4,B000EMG91S,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister and absolutely love it!  I was a fan of the show when PBS aired it along with other Britcoms on Saturday nights, but it's much different from the usual suspects (Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served, Keeping Up Appearances, et al)  Mulberry is more fairy tale than comedy, and reminds me of something Neil Gaiman might have written when in a happy mood.

A bit skimpy on extras, but then again, a small British show that only aired for two series probably doesn't have a lot to choose from.  The audio and video are fine, but nothing special.  For a show like Mulberry, the storytelling is really what mattered, so I don't miss the flash and glamour you can get from other DVDs or Blu-Rays.  There's a rumor a third series was written, but never produced.  It would have been nice if they would have included some sort of featurette about this.",1421539200,,894,4.481481481481482

2522435,4,B000EMG91S,"This short-lived early 1990s series is a quiet gem that may not please everyone, but there is something sweet behind its dark, bizarre premise.  Mulberry is the apprentice of Death (in this show's universe mortality is a father/son business whose wife/mother is Springtime... oh yes, VERY bizarre!)  His first assignment is to shepherd the lonely, up-tight spinster Miss Farnaby towards eternity during her last days on earth.  The pretext of his presence in her large manor house is as a new member of staff with her only two equally embittered retainers, the husband/wife pair of Bert and Alice.  Mulberry is supposed to be the living embodiment of the saying ""a breath of fresh air"": he's whimsical, absurd, contrary, and constantly chipper in the face of Miss Farnaby, Bert, and Alice's sour, miserable dispositions and going against the grain of what his father (Death) wants him to be.  The irony is not lost on me that, despite being literally the son of Death, Mulberry is the sunniest person in this show!
This is one of the most surreal, off-beat British sitcoms I've seen.  Despite Mulberry's peppiness, the tone of this show leans toward the quiet and gentle side of things.  And despite the fact that Mulberry is an agent of death, there are no tacky (or tasteless) tricks that demonstrate Mulberry has supernatural powers.  Death is taken seriously but with some imagination in this sitcom.  I actually wouldn't call it a sitcom... there are humorous moments, but overall nothing that will make your sides burst.  And that is a GOOD thing!  This little show has a special place in my heart because it is gentle and easy-going.  On a cold autumn or winter evening, this show can be a surprisingly warm companion.  Unfortunately, it proved to be too weird for the BBC and it was canceled without a decent conclusion.  So Miss Farnaby never discovers that Mulberry was sent to walk her towards the light.  Instead, this little program makes me ask some difficult questions... how will you spend your Mulberry days?  Will you enjoy life before it's over for good?  Don't sit on your high horse and fuss over the might-have-beens, regrets, or injustices that life has thrown at you, live the life you have and indulge in your whimsical side before the Mulberry days come to claim you.",1406764800,3,2293,4.853470437017995

2522521,5,B000EMG91S,This is an incredibly moving British series.  Why is it that the DVD only contains 9 episodes when the library version first watched had 13 episodes.  That is dropping out 4 wonderful episodes.....I can't think of any which should be eliminated.,1366588800,,245,4.951219512195122
2522522,5,B000EMG91S,"I can't imagine why the main review calls this both morbid and joyful. It's charming, life-affirming, and funny. Not morbid at all, unless you believe any mention of death is automatically morbid.

Mulberry is the son of Death and Springtime. Death wants Mulberry to start taking over the job.  But Mulberry takes after his mother, and Death finds him a frustrating apprentice. Mulberry would actually be much more suitable as an apprentice to Springtime.

Mulberry's first assignment for his father is Miss Farnaby, a crabby old lady whose time is up. (Actually she cannot be as old as she appears to be at first. She and her sisters were children together and played childrens' games together. Her sisters are definitely middle-aged, not old. At the most Miss Farnaby could have been somewhat older, but not a great deal older. I think she feels and acts older than her real age. Maybe this would have eventually been addressed in the series.)

In any case, anyone less suited to telling anyone their time is up would be hard to imagine. Instead Mulberry wants Miss Farnaby to come out of her shell and really live before she dies. In a way, you could say that as Springtime's son, Mulberry wants Miss Farnaby to experience her own Spring.

There are really two story lines here. First, will Miss Farnaby be granted any extra time, and if so, what use will she make of it? And second, will Mulberry be forced to take over for Death when he doesn't want the job and isn't suited for it?

Both leads are delightful and play off each other beautifully. It's maddening that the BBC cancelled this series when it was doing well. I really wanted to know what happened. I expect Springtime would have been more than a match for Death, and Mulberry would eventually have been able to choose his own path. After all, can Springtime really be put off forever?

As for Miss Farnaby, I imagine that when it really was her time, someone who loved her would indeed be there to open the door for her. In the end it might not have been Mulberry's real job, but it's a job I believe he would gladly do for Miss Farnaby.",1365984000,4,2104,4.579787234042553

2522524,4,B000EMG91S,"I stumbled across this and found it full of dry wit, fun, and a bit of black humor.  It can be slow at times, but the story idea is so unique that its well worth watching.

An older lady, Ms Farnaby, has withdrawn the world (played by the same wonderful actress who does Ms Marple) save for her childhood playmates, now servants, Burt and Alice.  A young man named Mulberry who wears black all of the time, except for his wild brightly colored vests, comes into her life and brings her back to an enjoyment of life...or keeps trying to.  Who is he?  Why is he here?  Who is this older man in black who keeps coming around?  I won't spoil it, but you will adore Mulberry and feel for him and his task after you get to know him.

Its a short series.  Too short.  They never completed the show and that is its biggest fault, leaving you to have to fill in the ending for yourself...and by the time you get there, you know exactly how the show should have ended.

Favorite episodes include the kite-flying one and the one where Ms Farnaby tries to set up Mulberry on a date.  Not as rip-roaring funny as some Britcoms, but worth watching.  Sweet and sad at the same time, as much as it has its laughs.",1365033600,,1197,4.220264317180617

It was heartwarming in Mulberry's (K.H.) efforts to bring Miss Farnaby (G.Mc) out of her shell and back into an active life.  Mulberry, who is in fact dead and on this mission given him by his father ""Death"", is completely delightful even when his father tells him to get on with preparing for Miss Farnaby for her own death.  Mulberry wins out - and they both have many hilariously funny, but also insightful adventures during this process.

In the British productions the costuming and settings are wonderful. The only thing I never like in any comedies is the laugh track. It's not terrible, but this could do without it because the humor is so gentle. I've chosen to ignore it.

There was no frenetic physical schtick, no blatant sexual innuendo and no biting, sarcastic wit.  It explored the budding friendship between the title character (with a hidden agenda of his own) and the wonderfully irascible Miss Farnaby (played with deft excellence by Geraldine McEwan).  Unfortunately, and perhaps because of this, at the close of the second season the BBC decided to cancel it.  Would that they had the courage to continue it.  In any case it allows the fans to create in their own minds the way the storyline pans out!

I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is a great series to introduce new viewers to British comedies. For those who are looking for a simliar type of series, I also suggest:  'As Time Goes By'.  Enjoy!-FrFUBAR",1263686400,2,1117,4.826315789473684

2522660,5,B000EMG91S,"This delightful series celebrates Mulberry days----the best days of one's life.

Miss Farnaby is a spinster, for whom bitterness has become a habit until her life is turned upsidedown----for the better----by a stranger, Mulberry, who arrives to fill the perpetually vacant post of her personal assistant. Mulberry, however, at the behest of his father, a mysterious and persistent stranger, has a darker agenda that he must reluctantly fulfil.

Geraldine McEwan's poignantly nuanced portrayal of Miss Farnaby is complemented by Karl Howman's Mulberry, whose slightly daffy antics eventually win her heart, while, at the same time, they drive Bert and Alice----Miss Farnaby's benignly conniving servants----to distraction. The viewer, however, is driven to a point halfway between laughter and tears.

My only complaint is that the series ends too soon. It also ends at a point which seems to ask questions that are yet to be answered. I was so hoping, in the last episode, that Miss Farnaby would recognize Mulberry  and go with him willingly.

But how often do we get a series that leaves us asking for more?!!!",1153785600,26,1112,5.224719101123595
2522661,5,B000EMG91S,"First, I love this series. But...

I have to ding Amazon for some errors in their details for this series. First, this is a 13 episode program spanning two sereis, not 9 episodes on 1 disc (unless the subtitle of ""the complete series"" is wrong on the DVD cover. This is backed up by two things:

1 - 377 minutes divided by 29 minutes per episode equals 13, and...

2 - I have 12 of the 13 from old PBS airings and know I'm missing the final one.

Now for the ""he should really stop being so picky"" part. This is an absolutely wonderful program -- as discussed nicely by others. Like a number of other British comedies, this bears up well under repeat viewings. Karl Howman is wonderful as the son of Death on his first and very reluctant assignment. Geraldine McEwan is a joy mixing an almost pixie-like twinkle and sense of humor combined with putting up a front of being a very proper, older British woman.

Having all episodes will show the only glitch in the two series, that being the departure of the original actress portraying ""Alice"" and her replacement. I was never really sure why Lill Roughley left after the first series. But a momentary suspension of ""why"" is all you need to get use to Alice #2. Otherwise, I can't fault it.

While I wholeheartedly agree that this was an all-too-brief show, I wonder if it could have maintained it quality much beyond a third series. Of course, they could have wrapped up a few things if they had 6 or 7 additional shows. Or even a special made for the Christmas viewing season like so many other Brit-coms.

Ah, well!",1153353600,18,1567,4.439024390243903
2522662,5,B000EMG91S,"I have been looking out for this DVD ever since my husband and I first saw the series on PBS.  Like the best Brit-coms, this series has unusual depth between the many laughs.  The last episode - with the seance - was one of the funniest single comedy episodes that my husband and I have ever seen.  In the best tradition of Bri-coms, there are only a limited number of episodes (think Faulty Towers).  The performances are perfect. The plot is described elsewhere and so I will not rehash it.",1153353600,4,492,4.433333333333334
2522663,3,B000EMG91S,"I was very please to have found this DVD series through Amazon because I had no recollection of this show at all. Maybe it was an age factor. The reason why I give this series three stars is because of the way it ended. Death was what the show was based on and call me morbid, but I would have like to see Miss. Farnaby's reaction once she realized whom Mulberry really was. I feel as if the show left me hanging. Other sitcoms can do that such as Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served, and Keeping Up Appearances, because after each episode the problems have been solved. Mulberry had more of a plot and actually could be called a drama in my opinion. It's just too bad that the fans were left hanging as to what really happened. How do we not know if father death changed his mind about Miss. Farnaby's death and decided to give her more time? And if she did die after three months it would have been good to see her eulogized because she became alive all over again and made a difference in other people lives towards the end of hers.",1151625600,6,1035,4.232323232323233
2522664,5,B000EMG91S,"Our family LOVED Mulberry when we first saw it on PBS. It is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen, while at the same time being completely appropriate for any audience. Karl Howan and Geraldine McEwan are superb, with perfect comic timing and incredible chemistry between them. Only the British could take a show about Death coming for an elderly woman and turn it into a delightful, laugh-out-loud comedy. It's not all humor though; there are some genuinely touching moments as Mulberry determines to help this elderly woman learn to enjoy life.

It's a shame that the BBC discontinued the show after two seasons. It is a true gem and I am delighted to see it again.",1150070400,12,673,4.65546218487395
