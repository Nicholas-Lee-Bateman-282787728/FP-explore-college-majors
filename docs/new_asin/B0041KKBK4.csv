4242847,5,B0041KKBK4,"We really like the Zorro series with Duncan Regehr, we got tired of the commercial breaks and the interruption in TV transmissions - so we just ordered all the seasons. I am so thrilled that all of seasons were available, now we can view one of our favorite old time shows in complete enjoyment.",1369958400,,295,4.481481481481482
4242848,5,B0041KKBK4,I enjoy watching these programs because the violence is low level and it always has a positive ending. Zorro is a hero and always wants to try to help the good people as well as show the bad guys the error of their ways. Charming.,1313625600,,230,4.133333333333334
4242849,5,B0041KKBK4,"With out repeating what the first two reviews said, Zorro Season 2 still maintains the thrills and excitement of season 1. I like the opening episode where Adam West guest stars as Dr Henry Wayne, perveyor of potions, elixyrs,and inventions. When Zorro brings a blindfolded Dr Wayne to the ""Zorrocave"" listen for a familar 8 note motif. Jumping to near the end of the season Devil's Fortress a two parter had the makings a great Zorro movie. The two-parter that came afterwards I believe should have come before Devil's Fortress. that is all, bye bye",1313539200,,550,4.8

4242851,5,B0041KKBK4,"I'm 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions. Do NOT try to ""compare"" it to the Disney series. They're totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more ""meat"" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults.",1289433600,3,581,4.705882352941177
4242852,4,B0041KKBK4,"You know pretty much what to expect in ""Zorro: The Complete Season Two"" -- swashbuckling, romance, action and lots of clever tricks. Like any good second season, it refines everything that was good about the first season, while also introducing Henry Darrow as the new Don Alejandro. And it takes a distinctly unexpected turn near the end.

When a weird inventor arrives at the pueblo, the Alcalde (Michael Tylo) enlists him to use his weird gadgets to trap Zorro... but things don't work out quite that way. And when Diego's fencing instructor arrives in Los Angeles, he's aghast to find that his best student pretends to be inept with a sword.

As the season goes on, Diego/Zorro must grapple with pirates, a cruel master swordsman, schooling Mendoza (James Victor) on romance, running the new newspaper, snake venom, an expert Indian tracker, the Alcalde's devious twin, Felipe's first love, ""The Falcon,"" a scheme to assassinate the Alcalde, an accused bandit's VERY BIG BROTHER, a haughty teenage boy, a bandit who whistles Beethoven, a jeweled sword, Amish people, and an encounter with the Three Musketeers' descendents.

But the biggest story comes at the end. Victoria (Patrice Camhi-Martinez) learns that her father is dying in the prison known as Devil's Fortress. As if that wasn't enough reason for Diego to go, the Alcalde is determined to find... SOMETHING in Devil's Fortress. But is Zorro a match for the deadly cunning of the warden and his daughter?

""Zorro: The Complete Season Two"" is a pretty natural extension of the first season, but the writers polished up some of the rough spots and added Henry Darrow to the cast. It has everything you'd expect from a Zorro series -- swashbuckling, romance, broad moments of comedy, and plenty of colorful antagonists and lighthearted problems (despite the constant crimes and oppression).

But there are also some darker moments woven into the story, such as when Victoria is almost fatally wounded protecting Zorro, and Diego seriously considers quitting the whole Zorro facade. And without revealing too much, there's a shocking twist at the season's end that promises to have major repercussions. Downsides? There are still some schlocky episodes, such as the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" episode, or the episode about an Amish family (RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE! Bang us over the head with it!).

There's also a new addition to the cast: Henry Darrow replaces Efram Zimbalist Jr. as Don Alejandro de la Vega, and he's got the fiery no-nonsense air that fits the part beautifully. There are also some new dimensions given to the Alcalde, who has to humble himself in front of Zorro while grappling with malevolent relatives, and Victoria, whose tragic past is explored in detail.

""Zorro: The Complete Season Two"" polishes up the rougher spots of the series, and adds some dramatic new twists to the story. Swashbuckling, romance and humor galore!",1287532800,3,2901,5.081932773109243
8412834,5,B0041KKBK4,"You can't get much better when it comes to ZORRO. Duncan Regehr is a real sweetheart in this; serious yet sweet, kind and gentle. He brings something else to the character and you can't complain it isn't great to watch. Each actor to play ZORRO brings something different and I highly recommend this series from the 1990 tv show series.",1506211200,,336,4.616666666666666

8412837,5,B0041KKBK4,"Some of the most memorable episodes were in this season.

This season has the death of Alcalde Luis Ramone.  In his final episode he'd stolen the de la Vega's land grant, planning to claim their land for himself.  He was trying to climb down a several story wall, when Zorro caught up with him.  Zorro would have helped him up, in exchange for the document.  Instead Luis chose to snatch Zorro's mask, revealing Diego's face, and losing his balance in the process.  He fell to his death, screaming ""I should have Known"".

In a 2 part episode Diego takes a vacation to France.  There he met the descendants of the 3 Musketeers.  He donned his mask and called himself Le Renard - French for The Fox.  Le Renard helped the descendants defeat their own Tyrant, and become worthy of calling themselves Musketeers.

In one episode the alcalde's twin brother tried to steal Luis's identity and position.  The Twin was a murderer and thief, same as Luis.  The only difference between the brothers was one committed murder and robbery by legal means and the other by illegal.  Zorro helped expose the impostor, simply because he preferred an enemy he knew to the one he didn't.

My favorite episode was when Diego's Sword Teacher, Sir Edmond Kendall, came to California.  On arrival he was shocked to learn Diego had been concealing his Sword Skills, and Edmond was disgusted by the Alcalde.  Near the end Edmond was shot, near death, but when he saw Zorro holding off the Militia his face lit up.  The mask didn't fool him, he knew Diego's fighting stile.  Kendall died knowing Zorro would never stop fighting the Good Fight - that he'd trained a champion for Justice.

8412839,5,B0041KKBK4,"I have watched two discs of Zorro with Duncan Regehr and so far I am glad I purchased it.  I feel that the Disney version of Zorro with Guy Williams is the one to beat, but this one is quite entertaining also.  I decided to buy Season 2 because some other reviewers suggested it to be the best of the 4 disc series. Another reason for choosing Season 2 is some of the actors change through the series.  I like the ones on season 2 better.  The episodes are short, so this makes it easy to watch one or two at a time.  Overall the show is great!",1422489600,,544,4.0

8412843,5,B0041KKBK4,Duncan Regehr plays an excellent Zorro in the tradition of the swashbuckling hero. The theme music is catchy. The bonus disc with clips from previous Zorros was nostalgic. A very good buy.,1391558400,,188,4.90625
