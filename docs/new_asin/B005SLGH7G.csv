4885772,5,B005SLGH7G,"Andre Rieu and his orchestra give an EXCELLENT
performance where ever they present a program.
He is a collectors dream.  In my opinion this
team gets better with each performance.  Well
worth the time, effort and the money to collect.",1330128000,15,234,4.825

4885774,5,B005SLGH7G,"The incomparable Andre Rieu, what more needs to be said, the man and orchestra that brought classical music to the masses, always enjoyable, and sometimes extremely entertaining. This particular video has a surprise guest/composer, a real surprise!",1448409600,,248,5.72972972972973

4885778,5,B005SLGH7G,This is one of the best of his DVD's.  We enjoyed the scenic scenes of Vienna.  I wish it were in English.,1431561600,,106,3.772727272727273
4885779,5,B005SLGH7G,"I heard ""And the Waltz Goes On"" only once and I had to have it in my collection. It is absolutely gorgeous. The most amazing thing to me is that it was composed by movie actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was a musician before becoming famous in movies. His story is told here as well and you can see him enjoying it for the first time since he composed it 50 years earlier. The rest of the CD is wonderful: It has all the beautiful Strauss waltzes and gives the fascinating background of Andre Rieu's gorgeous scenery he takes with them on their tours around the world. The waltz is a very happy, healing music to listen to for it is totally stress free and relaxing. I recommend this recording very highly.",1430611200,2,704,4.340909090909091

4885781,5,B005SLGH7G,This is a wonderful DVD.  It shows his new stage which is a lifesize model of the palace in Vienna.  I hope he brings it to the US.  The music is also great as his music always is.,1428537600,,180,3.6842105263157894

4885783,5,B005SLGH7G,"Another of my favorite DVDs!  I thought the inclusion of the music box in Anthony Hopkin's beautiful 'And the Waltz Goes On' was a genius idea - delightful!  Love, Love, Love Stephanies ""Ballad for Adeline'.  Andre's masterful touch on the violin makes 'My Heart Will Go On' tug at the heart strings!",1425859200,,300,4.730769230769231

4885787,5,B005SLGH7G,"If you love music, you must also love the smooth music of an Waltz. No one plays them like Andre Rieu and his orchestra.
Then to see the various members of his orchestra play this beautiful music. You'll want to turn down the lights, with you favorite
drink in hand, and maybe that special someone next to you. You'll find yourself up and in each others arms as you join in.

4885802,4,B005SLGH7G,"Disappointed was ""captioned"" in english.  Otherwise enjoyable.  As always, Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss orchestra make any song they pleasurable.",1403481600,,150,6.095238095238095
4885803,1,B005SLGH7G,"This dvd is a total waste of time. It is close to 3 hours long and boring. There were only two new songs on the whole dvd. Most of the dvd was cuts from old past dvd's.  There were meaningless interviews with a German singer, boring scenes from old dvd's as to how different programs were put together. No solos! what a waste of talent. It was so bad, I returned the dvd for a complete refund!!!!!",1403481600,2,397,4.1558441558441555

4885805,5,B005SLGH7G,"I had seen a couple of Mr. Rieu's YouTube items posted by my friends on Facebook and was very impressed.  I needed more music DVD's to play for my husband, who is ill and happened to think of Andre Rieu.  What an excellent choice!  It's not only the music that is so wonderful, but also the sets and surprises throughout.  I definitely will be purchasing more of his work.",1401494400,,372,4.3478260869565215
4885806,5,B005SLGH7G,"I have been purchasing Andre' Rieu CD's and DVD's for at least 25 years now. Every time I think he has reached the pinnacle of his God given gift to the world, he ratchets up the Johann Strauss Orchestra and the concert venue and soars to new heights of entertainment. Like all his other products, this is a must have to watch and share.",1397779200,2,337,4.28125
4885807,4,B005SLGH7G,"I have several DVDs by Rieu.  This DVD, while entertaining with typically pleasing performances by the orchestra, I do not consider it the best Rieu program.  Yet, well produced, it surely is worthy of addition to the collections of Rieu fans.",1393200000,,243,4.902439024390244

4885810,3,B005SLGH7G,"Andre Rieu is very popular and seems to be re-introducing Operetta type music to his fans, but I prefer more classical music like the Atlanta Symphony performances.",1374710400,,164,5.111111111111111
4885811,5,B005SLGH7G,"PROBABLY THE BEST CONCERT YET FROM ANDRE RIEU.
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN GERMAN, IT WAS STILL FUN.
WE FELT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LONG, BUT VERY GOOD.",1374192000,2,143,3.9655172413793105
4885812,5,B005SLGH7G,This DVD has numberous presentations at different places on various occasions and the sceens are truly beautiful. To gaze upon people from different parts of our world proves that we all are the same and music is our lifetine!,1373414400,,226,4.82051282051282
4885813,5,B005SLGH7G,"I finally saw Andre Rieu in person, and his DVD does justice to a live performance.  The music is wonderful, and he surrounds himself with outstanding performers.  I highly recommend any of his DVDs.",1370304000,6,199,4.823529411764706

4885817,4,B005SLGH7G,"All of Andre' Rieu's work is exceptional. However, he is playing a lot of the same music on each one. We love watching him, but it is time he adds new music and only a few of the old standards. Would recommend it to Andre' followers for their collections.",1361059200,,255,4.224489795918367
4885818,1,B005SLGH7G,"I thought I ordered CDs but they are DVD and I have no such player.

4885819,4,B005SLGH7G,Wish that it had been in English - at least it had sub-titles. The orchestra in formal attire is always beautiful to see.,1360022400,,121,4.304347826086956

4885822,5,B005SLGH7G,"I'm a fan of Andre Rieu and have a number of his DVDs and CDs.  I like this CD very much, it shows his warm relationship with Sir Anthony Hopkins who impressed me the most by writing a very nice waltz.  I like the waltz, it really makes you feel like dancing. I'm more happy for him because this waltz was written well over 30 years ago.  How nice it is to finally hear your creation put to full orchestration.  The dvd is very nice.",1355702400,,433,4.0588235294117645
4885823,5,B005SLGH7G,"Surprise. The begining is an every day Andre DVd. With a problem with artificial snow . I was going to stop it and shelved, but somehow we continued viewing it. The second part is excellent but the Third part is a diamond. The best moments in any of Andre's DVDs. A must see. I have seen this part several times. There are two surprises and the award given to him by the Austrian Government. The location is incredible beautiful. There is a fourth part which is highligths of different shows in different countries. But the Award ceremony and the two surprises of the Third part makes this DVD one of Andre's best.
Enjoy.",1354233600,14,621,4.504424778761062
