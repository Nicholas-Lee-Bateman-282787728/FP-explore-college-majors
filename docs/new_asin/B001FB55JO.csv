3567109,5,B001FB55JO,"Belorussia in 1941. Germans and local collaborators hunt Jews. The Bielski brothers, in civilian times apparently not really choir boys, escape into the forests and attract followers, other refugees, who are desperate for help. A camp in the forest, an unsteady symbiosis with Russian troops nearby. Raids for food can't avoid getting noticed by the German army, whose attacks follow; the camp has to run. The refugees find another location for a camp. Apparently based on true events.

The film is about big subjects: strategy, leadership, discipline, solidarity. No surprises,just basic constellations and human conflicts. Wonderful cinematography. Solid work by Mr. Zwick (who apparently has a personal relation to the real Bielskis; family?). Good show by Mr. James Bond as Tuvia Bielski; the other actors do well too (but I don't know them).",1230940800,35,846,5.360902255639098
3567110,3,B001FB55JO,"Director Edward Zwick likes his epic war films full of tragedy and thick accents. With Defiance he's chosen a seldom explored true story of Jewish rebels fighting back against their Nazi aggressors in the Belarusian forest; but even with the stage set for heart-wrenching drama and tragic wartime attrition, the film can't quite manage enough emotionally engaging pathos for its band of oddly anti-heroic protagonists.

After escaping Nazi-occupied Poland during the onset of World War II, three Jewish brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), and Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell) flee to the Belarusian forest where they encounter several other refugees. After numerous casualties from hasty attacks on German soldiers, Tuvia decides that revenge be substituted for survival and begins constructing a village in the forest to shelter his comrades and the growing influx of Jews fleeing Poland. Zus, opposed to Tuvia's more peaceful tactics, opts to join Russian partisans operating nearby, but fate and a common enemy will find their paths crossing once again.

Defiance certainly feels like an Edward Zwick film, full of heavy dramatic action, sweeping epic conflicts and historical significance. But like his other political and war driven films (Blood Diamond and The Last Samurai) Defiance falls short of being something truly special due to a lack of investment with the characters. The settings, costumes, cinematography and acting are all first rate, but the development of lead roles and even supporting characters leaves something to be desired, especially when the end of the film abruptly rolls around and great revelations or emotional moments are curiously absent.

Defiance is a lesser known chapter from the melting pot of World War II movies and gains points for bringing to our attentions the horrors and triumphs of a band of survivors who achieved the impossible. But like the middle part of a trilogy, the film is paced and concludes anticlimactically like a piece of a much larger plot - one that must struggle to get to the action, and then loses steam as it heads toward the inevitable afterward events summaries. Without tearjerker moments and characters that don't push enough emotional buttons, Defiance is a film that is likely to remain as obscure as its subject matter - a historically powerful chapter that could have been better represented.

3567111,4,B001FB55JO,"True to its advertising claims, ""Defiance"" tells a story I've never heard before: That of the Bielski Partisans, a Jewish rebellion from Poland that rallied against Nazi occupiers at the height of World War II. Originally founded by the remaining sons of the Bielski family, it soon ballooned into an organization consisting of thousands of people, all freed from local Jewish ghettos. They struggled to survive in the Belarussian forests, facing starvation, disease, and exposure to the elements. Their story was documented in the book ""Defiance: The Bielski Partisans"" by Nechama Tec, and this is the basis for the Edward Zwick's film. I give him credit for directing and co-writing a compelling story in which core human emotions are at odds with basic survival skills; in any such scenario, one must decide whether forgiveness, fairness, and tolerance is more important than staying alive.

In spite of its subject matter, ""Defiance"" is far from a perfect film. A lot of it felt like an adaptation, which is to say that it relies too heavily on war movie clich&eacute;s like melodramatic dialogue and overt symbolism. I was especially wary of a death scene late in the film; with his last breath, he turns to Daniel Craig's character and says, ""I had almost lost my faith. But you were sent by God to save us."" Does this not seem contrived? It's second only to obvious visual statements for hope and redemption, as when sunshine bathes the partisans after weeks of harsh winter conditions, or when they all trudge across a swamp in the same way Moses and his chosen people trudged across the parted Red Sea. The creativity and technical merits of such moments are overshadowed by the sense that they don't belong.

Still, the drama is persuasive, and the performances are decent given the material they had to work with. Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, and George MacKay portray Tuvia, Zus, Asael, and Aron Bielski, four brothers from West Belarus who lost their parents soon after the Germans invaded. Aron is virtually ignored in the film, and whenever he is featured, he mostly remains quiet and unassuming. The other three, however, are given very distinct personalities, all of which add to the drama and make the story much more personal. Tuvia, for example, is initially angry over the deaths of his parents, and he personally tracks down and kills the Germans responsible. But it isn't long before he realizes how wrong his actions were, and he spends the rest of the film trying to convince himself that the best revenge is mere survival. He also believes that everyone in hiding deserves equal portions of food and must do their fair share of work; this puts him at odds with certain survivors, who feel that those working harder deserve better treatment.

Zus, on the other hand, remains angry throughout the entire film. He doesn't agree with Tuvia's more forgiving philosophy--he wants revenge, plain and simple. Because he doesn't get along with his brother, he decides to join a militant group of Soviet partisans also at odds with the Nazis. And as for Asael, the film focuses more on his romance with a young girl named Chaya (Mia Wasikowska), who in real life held the rare distinction of being a high school graduate.

Having now done a little research on the subject, I'm surprised at just how much Zwick left out of the screenplay. One of the biggest controversies surrounding the film is the omission of the 1943 Naliboki Massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 128 people. The Bielski partisans were accused of taking part in this alongside Soviet partisans. The fact that many historians deny their involvement should be of no consequence; an event so monumentally tragic should at least be acknowledged as having happened. I'm well aware that a film can only hold so much material before it gets unbearably long, but the way I see it, the Naliboki Massacre is too important to have overlooked.

There are also a few logistical issues that seemed to have slipped under the radar, such as the fact that so many of the partisans are never in short supply of alcohol. Where are they getting this alcohol from, and why is it easier to get than food? This doesn't seem very plausible.

Despite these problems, ""Defiance"" is still worth recommending, mostly because the performances are believable. It has its other good points: the cinematography is top notch, revealing the squalor the partisans had to live in; James Newton Howard's score is both solemn and exciting, a combination of violin dirges and piano solos; the struggle between survival and vengeance is convincing, especially during a scene in which a Nazi is captured and made to face the wrath of the partisans. I see this film as an introduction of sorts, a way to let the public know that it's based on actual events. Now that we know, I think it would be wise for another filmmaker to tell a more accurate story, one that doesn't have to rely on traditional war movie clich&eacute;s to send the audience a message.",1230681600,5,5009,4.859484777517564

There's always a very tiny fraction demonstrating human potential to the rest but the rest seldom rise to their own potential because essentially they do not challenge their limited concepts and beliefs and instead, follow the ways of their traditions based on animal instinct - 'survival of the fittest or the more clever'. Making themselves pathetic
in the process. This movie only proves these reflective assertions. I so wish it were otherwise and one day, it shall be, once humanity tires of its own pathetic behavior.

Here you see a group of people surrounded by a forest of wild, eatable plants, believing there is nothing to eat! I ask you, how pathetic is that?!
We are here to learn how to love unconditionally and as a species, we are failing miserably. Time for divine intervention. Are you ready to open your heart in the fullness of love? If so, you are part of the solution and I thank you for your service.

While is not a completely accurate representation of the events that took place in the Russian forest, it gives the viewer some insight into the harsh and nasty conditions that this group of Jewish citizens had to endure for their freedom. The Beilski brothers went to great lengths to keep themselves, their neighbors and total strangers out of the hands of the Nazi party, and the Russian people who supported the Nazi efforts. It is a compelling story of love, strength, compassion, and basic human nature to protect one's self, and those around you that are suffering the same fate. While the movie does not depict the actual number of Jewish citizens that the Bielski brothers saved, it was roughly 1,200 people, it shows how they all learned to work together, and to provide the basic human needs. This group of people came together for the greater good of themselves, and eachother. It is a compelling story, with great actors and actresses telling a very little known story of the Holocaust through the eyes of the Russian Jews. The viewer gets to see some of the realities that faced the Jewish nation outside of Germany and the surrounding areas during WWII.

3570355,3,B001FB55JO,"Well. First off let me right up front say that I get irritated by movie directors that have actors running around doing things that don't actually work in the real world, and this movie is guilty of an awful lot of that. It was more of an action adventure movie than any sort of historical action thriller, that is unless you think every russian jew was a dumbed down caricature of a person (read-character development was lacking), and the heros basically just sat around drinking a LOT and running about with a sub-machine gun with apparently inexhaustible magazines waving them around while running and actually hitting everything they pointed it in the general direction of. Also the German army were professionals, very much so in fact. They at least carried the correct arms, the russian jews on the other hand did have 1891/30 variants (Mosin Nagants) but the sub guns apparently were not in stock with the movie gun rental company so they were running around with a couple of  Schmeissers (MP-40) instead of the very fine PPSh41 which shot ammunition that was actually readily available to them. I know, I'm nitpicking. The problem was that after a while I got tired of the plot line, which by the way was basically the germans hunting the jews, they hide in the woods, and after getting some sort of food supply and shooting a bunch of people running away and shooting some more people. Also they avoided the germans pretty much the whole time until the end when they apparently were attacked by Colonel Klink and the rest of the gang from Hogan's Heros with the same amount of bungling who then stood up and couldn't hit anything at all instead of doing what they would have done which is hit the dirt and shot many of them. It just wasn't much of a plot line, run away, firefight, bomb run with stukkas (which were fitted with sirens to terrify whoever they were bombing) that made no noise, and bombs which didn't do very much honestly. Carnage? No they just knock you over a little.
Pair of of ^ that with the fact that Daniel Craig seems to own a perpetually self shaving face and you have ""Defiance"". The acting was powerful when it needed to be, but the screenplay was crap and the directing was crap. Basically it was crap... but I like a crap movie from time to time as long as the good guys win so... three stars.",1444867200,,2332,4.552380952380952

3571262,4,B001FB55JO,"Defiance"" is a very entertaining, exciting, suspenseful, and inspirational film about a tough topic: the Holocaust. Its many action sequences are well-paced and well-motivated. You know exactly why Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig) breaks into a home and points a gun at a man in front of his family. Daniel Craig and Live Schreiber are terrific as Tuvia and Zus Bielski, who lead a band of Jewish forest partisans during World War Two, thus saying over a thousand lives.

The movie is not perfect. Characters speak English with Slavic accents. In other scenes, they speak Russian or Belarusian. Craig and Schreiber manage very good Slavic accents, both when speaking English and when speaking the Slavic languages, but Craig occasionally lapses into his English accent when speaking English. Female characters are not particularly well drawn, or given much to do. While this film is very good, it doesn't have the production values to be a timeless classic like ""Schindler's List."" The movie is controversial. Most of the controversies are shallow relative to the most important facts at hand. Many of those attacking this movie have axes to grind, including current events in the Middle East or feuds between Poles and Jews. The most important fact is this: the Nazis committed a genocide of six million Jews. In the midst of this Satanic nightmare, the Bielskis managed to save over a thousand Jews. That's the main, and absolutely true, point here, and it should not be lost in bickering over details.

Compared to other treatments of the Holocaust, this film is fair. It doesn't show Slavic peasants as uniformly Jew-hating collaborators. Nazis, not Slavic peasants, were the authors and perpetrators of the Holocaust. Some occupied peoples collaborated, often out of fear and for financial gain or as payback for old grudges. Some occupied peoples did everything they could to help Jews, as does a Belarusian peasant in this film.

The Bielskis were not immaculate. They did summarily execute captured Germans, as shown here. They did raid peasants for provisions, as shown here. They did work with the Soviets, but so did Uncle Sam. Remember that photo of FDR and Churchill smiling with Stalin at Yalta. The Polish IPN institute is investigating charges that members of the Bielski partisans, but not the Bielskis themselves, participated in the 1943 Soviet massacre of 128 people in Naliboki. Aron, the youngest Bielski brother, was, in 2007, accused of defrauding an elderly Polish woman. These failures of the Bielski brothers to be perfect in no way lessen their achievement, any more than any failure to be perfect lessen any hero's achievement. Again, in the face of genocide, the Bielski brothers managed to save over a thousand people. Were they perfect? No. Were they admirable, heroic, and worth learning about? Absolutely yes.",1441670400,2,2839,5.1274298056155505

3571825,5,B001FB55JO,"Why would anyone judge a movie just by the first, say, 20 mins? True, in Save Private Ryan, the beginning is spectacular and breath-taking, so did the Schindler's List, but different movies have different styles. The beginning for this movie is essential to render a foundation for the background and for character developing. Just because Jew-holocaust WWII genre isn't novel any more doesn't mean all audiences should be refused the chance to be immersed into a realistic personal experience of that unhappy era. One is free to leave to choose one's better after watching only a portion of the movie, but that doesn't grant one the right to comment on the movie FOR OTHERS (okay for oneself or if BEGGED to express personal opinions). If you really think a movie poorly and would like to announce your reasons by commenting, at least make the sacrifice to complete the movie. So, please, no more comments like ""left only after watching for XX mins.""

Personally I think the movie really excels in pulling out the viewers' sympathy (and empathy) for the characters. The rhythm is good -- now and then a blessed camp community moment in between surviving thrills and community tenses. Characters are thus not only struggling for survival but also tormented with their conflicting vulnerability and strength. The difficulties on all fronts are adequately presented and weighted in the film. The lack of big super-fighting scenes (except the last engagement) all the better makes the film shining not in gores or glory, but really in a survival epic catalyzed by the Nazi pursuit. After all, the survivors aren't the Allies' soldiers with gear and provisions, but scavengers. So an absolutely riveting humanity-probing journal, but not a super-hero, acrobatic, B-17 bragging, or army-man moaning cliche.",1439251200,2,1801,5.125850340136054

3573157,5,B001FB55JO,"I won't reiterate the plot here, but this is a terrific film that does a really fine job of humanizing all the characters. Daniel Craig and Liev Schrieber are  terrific as brothers, as is almost everyone. There's a scene where the rabbi (I think, at least some sort of professor) gives a prayer that is a profound appeal, almost a reprimand, to God in the middle of hell, and says essentially, as a Jew, ""whatever blessing or privilege we supposedly have as the chosen people, it ain't worth it. Please un-choose us."" It good easily have gone all Woody Allen but instead it is so heartfelt and sincere it is the emotional tent-pole of the film.
Another worthy scene shows the Jewish camp members in the forest, the women and old men, mostly, beat a German soldier prisoner to death as he begs for his life. Daniel Craig's character watches but does not interfere. He does not agree with the action, but he understands their profound rage. The Russian commander of a partisan group with whom the brothers are cooperating is also terrific as a morally gray man in an impossible command situation. He will happily drink with you or shoot you with equal aplomb. It's your call.
There are some ""big picture"" scenes also, in particular one in the ghetto in the beginning of the film where one of the Jewish leaders declines an opportunity to escape to the forest. ""The Germans need us to work,"" he argues. ""Things are bad, but they can't kill us, they need us!"" His profound failure of imagination is impressive.
Daniel Craig plays a man who is doing a task he didn't ask for, and shows a great range of strength and fragility. Liev Schreiber his brother who is more inclined to fight alongside the Russians than hide in the woods and whose character is less nuanced than Craig's, but in the end blood wins.
This is an important film both because of its quality and because it really helps explain how things went so wrong for the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis. i should mention that the action sequences are very well done and realistic, as are the technical aspects.",1431907200,5,2076,4.580645161290323

I don't want to hint at any spoilers in my review...  but I will say this - Daniel Craig and Liev Shriber are just electric as the two brothers who head a band of Jewish refugees, who, in order to escape the Nazi ""Final Solution"" build themselves a village and defensive team in the Belorussian woods during the closing years of WWII.

There are some great cliffhangers, some wonderful nail biting tension, and a depth of character development that would leave most any person well satisfied.  I think it'd make great family viewing as well - to open up discussion about the Holocaust.

I could go on, but I suggest you watch and judge for yourself.",1431043200,2,673,4.575

Two Jewish brothers embark on a journey to escape Nazi occupied Eastern Europe and they  hideout  in the Belarussian forrest. Once there they meet Russian resistance fighters and in these woods (which must have been far far away from civilization) they brought and found Jews who had escaped, began to build a village.  this village would protect at least l,000 non-military Jews who had fled the Nazi Regime.

As you watch the story unfold it becomes clear that not everyone could  thrive in this life. In the dead of winter; in the heat of summer; whatever happened when tempers flared these brave brothers and their charges put forth a valiant effort to stay alive to bring peace among themselves and, to live to tell the story of the German invasion and the cruelty that had just  begun.

Danial Craig and Liev Schreiber play the brothers and they are both magnificent.
They have a rocky road in front of them and don't always agree about anything or anybody but they are all about helping their fellow Jews stay alive.
I watched this movie with tear-stained eyes throughout. I thought ""If it were me could I have lived through that."" I honestly don't think I could but these Jews; they were determined and the story of their plight is to be in viewed in awe!",1429315200,3,1491,4.550561797752809

3574749,5,B001FB55JO,"I have repeatedly watched this film.  Every few months, a scene of deep human commitment begins to play in my head and I cannot wait to watch Defiance again.  It is hard to watch, especially the opening scenes.  Even though I have heard friends speak of this time, read books of man's inhumanity to man, and seen movies depicting episodes of genocide...it is always soul tearing, and never gets any easier to experience.  What is so amazing about this story is what happens among the survivors, and what lengths they are willing to go to, to remain free; not just for them to survive, but for any others willing to take this hard road, for a slim chance at freedom.  The title Defiance, is a brilliant description of the spirit that arises out of horror, and could just as well be called Triumph!",1428537600,2,796,4.538461538461538

The movie covers their first year.  The relationship of the brothers and the differences in their personalities was interesting.  The story itself is amazing.  Lots of violence, but I figure if they had to live through the actual events, I should be able to watch it for a couple of hours, and give their story a chance to be told to me.  I would like to see more movies like this, that show personal stories of people who lived through this horrible time, and how they managed to cope and survive.  While stories like this are shocking, sickening, sad, and emotional, they are also uplifting in that we see that humans can survive tragic events beyond imagination, and be reassured that sometimes good does prevail over evil.",1428451200,,896,4.639240506329114

When you think they survivors will rise above brutality yiu get a taste of humanity at its basest level. Guess you can tell I liked it a lot.

Basically a feel-good movie showing that some Jews actually did take up arms and did fight back; but lacking in historical accuracy.  The Bielski's were actually Polish Jews, living in pre-war Poland as farmers and millers; I don't think that was disclosed as such.  The war started when Germany invaded into western and northern Poland, and Russia, seeing an opportunity to expand, attacked into eastern Poland.  The Polish civilians, caught in the middle wether Jew or Catholic, were victimized.  The Russians were friends of the Germans until Hitler had other ideas.
The Bielski partisans did help to save about 1,200 people (not all Jews), but in the effort to survive were believed to have killed perhaps over 100 Polish civilians.  If you are curious, research it for yourself.  The post-war follow-up on the lives of the Bielski brothers chose to leave some details out also.  This movie was based on the book, which probably goes into greater detail.",1426377600,,1032,4.994152046783626

If you want a WW2 themed movie about the struggles of survival and the drama of the world turning its back on you then you can't go wrong with this choice. If you have Amazon Prime then you are in luck because it should be ""free"" to watch. But even then its a steal and this will be a classic in the years to come.

We view the plight of these people from the perspective of knowing the outcome of the war, and it is difficult to imagine how they maintained their positive attitude while anticipating that the war would probably turn out negative for their people.

The action was simply believable and not overly dramaticized, making it very stark and gripping. Daniel Craig was excellent; he is probably better suited to this role than he is to that of James Bond. Liev Schreiber was quite good, as were several of the other cast members. I have frequently found myself thinking back over this story since watching it several days ago.

This movie is one of those profound and moving looks into those pasts. Daniel Craig always does a good job and have yet to see a movie I did not like that he starred in.

The acting in this movie was on par and it was well-directed and choreographed. The camera work was also very good and it really tried to show how difficult things were back then. When I was in college I remember hearing all about Jewish history in my religions class. it's one of those stories that takes a long time to go over and it deserves that much, too.

I was very pleasantly surprised how good it turned out to be.  It was a good (and worthy) story with good acting; absorbing, enjoyable and thought provoking.  Afterward I wanted to find out more about the real life people and events that inspired it.  (You can't help but feel admiration for them and sadness for what they endured.)
Beyond the main story, the personalities of the characters and their interactions were also entertaining.  As appalling as the situation was, there was also humor.  ""You annoy me, therefore I exist"".

The actor who plays Zus (Liev Schreiber) usually plays a bad guy in other movies so it was nice and unexpected to see him play a good guy.  I didn't realize Zus is physically bigger than Tuvia (Daniel Craig).

A highly recommended movie.

Another great WWII movie is ""Enemy At The Gates"".",1423008000,,359,4.546875
3577290,5,B001FB55JO,Outstanding. Simply outstanding.,1423008000,,32,10.0
3577291,4,B001FB55JO,"It's a great story, and it makes a good-looking movie here, with strong performances from Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell, and great location work in Eastern Europe in the forests quite near to where the actual events took place on which this story is based.  The director Edward Zwick obviously likes the big historical canvas -- as in ""Glory"" -- and he has made a film that gestures appropriately at the kind of heroism displayed by the Bielski brothers Tuvia (Craig) and Zus (Schreiber) as they sought to protect over a thousand Jews from Nazi attacks in the Belorussian forests between 1941 and 1945.  The action covers the first two years of their arboreal nomadic existence, perhaps because later Nazi attacks on their camps tapered off as German attention focused more on the Western front.  The following comments list some reservations I have about the movie, but these are not meant in any way to discourage your seeing it.  Rather, they indicate where Zwick (and/or his screenwriters) made what I think were some compromises with Hollywood conventions -- and maybe broader cultural conventions as well -- despite Zwick's desire to have made a movie that wasn't just ""another Hollywood movie"" (as he says in one of the special features).

1. The narrative sets up the brothers as types: Tuvia is the man who wants to fight the Nazis without becoming monstrous, like the Nazis.  He wants to build a community and would rather die as a human being than live as an animal.  Zus has no time for scruples; he just wants to fight.  Both men's families have been killed, and their reactions to hearing of their respective losses cement the type difference.  The movie goes on to show that one can fight without losing one's humanity, but the characterization of the brothers poses the issue too conveniently.  The movie wants to respect history, and does to some extent, but can't resist the temptation, endemic to Hollywood, to shape history as moral fable.  Another honorable WW2 movie, ""Schindler's List,"" couldn't resist the temptation either.

2.  Related to point 1, is the issue of the representation of the Germans.  They are faceless armored men, and the scenes of their being killed by the ""Bielski partisans"" are perfunctory and unbloody.  Zus's encounter with a German tank late in the movie is sheer Hollywood -- satisfying in a predictable way, especially because Zus, who had left his brother's camp to join a Russian partisan group that he thought more committed to fighting, returns to his brother's group and, in effect, saves the day.  Let's call that trope ""the prodigal returns.""  It's an old one.

3.  There's typing within Tuvia's community.  There's the secular socialist intellectual Malbin (Mark Feuerstein) and the religious, almost rabbi-like ex-teacher Haretz (Allan Corduner) who form a kind of choric commentary on the project of maintaining community and the prospects for success.  Almost predictably, they learn to like one another, thus showing that moral secularism can co-exist more than comfortably with religious traditionalism.  The women in the movie too are pretty typical -- they learn to be feisty and to fight like men and yet still be women.  You begin to see a pattern here; contrasts of temperament, gender, belief are set up only to be transcended.  We CAN all get along -- except with the faceless Nazis, of course.  And the Russians that Zus joins turn out not to like Jews very much . . . and Zus realizes that his identity as a Jew matters more than he perhaps had thought earlier, when he claimed his identity as a fighter.  Also, in keeping with standard typing, the youngest Bielski brother, Asael (Jamie Bell), who is too shy to talk to a girl early in the movie, is by the end a seasoned fighter, able to rally the community at just the moment when Tuvia seems ready to quit.  Tuvia himself is figured explicitly as Moses -- though unlike Moses he makes it to the Promised Land.

4.  I wonder -- did the movie really have to engage the question ""Why didn't the Jews in Central Europe and Germany resist the Nazis?""  Tuvia says explicitly at one point that he and his group are demonstrating that Jews CAN resist.  The question, of course, tends to imply a criticism of the European Jews as culturally emasculated.  In 2008, when the movie was released, did that slur even have to be responded to?  The screenwriters obviously thought so, but really??  I mean, why didn't Protestant Germans resist en masse, for heaven's sake?  To take such questions seriously is to make a judgment about your audience as historically ignorant as well as ignorant of complicated social dynamics.

These four considerations are no reason to avoid the movie.  They just make the point that the movie works as much through familiar rhetoric as through the representation of actual events.  And, I repeat, the film is beautifully shot and the acting is all that one could ask, given the way the narrative has been constructed.  Definitely worth watching -- and see the Special Features too for some comment from the Bielski family.",1422921600,,5084,4.867441860465116

3577296,5,B001FB55JO,"The movie was able to tell a story, in a delightful way.  I imagine that trying to figure out who you are, in an environment that they were in could be a very difficult situation.  The acting, in a sense, had to be the same way.  The brothers had to figure out which side of the tracks they were going to belong on, while seeing what they themselves were made of.  That won't happen over night.  Anyone who thinks it would be easy to survive in this situation is not being truthful to themselves.  I have first hand stories of survival from family members, of whom had to flee communism as their country was being divided after the war was almost over, leaving thousands more people dead, homeless, fatherless, and without means to survive.  It is an honor for this movie to be made, to at least try to illustrate the dedication these two brothers had in trying to find a solution in a world of anger and pain.  I imagine the release of built up anger (spoiler alert), in capturing a German solider, and then taking that anger out on him was a viable solution to the problem at the time.  In 1941 the camps were already being used to slaughter thousands of Jews a day.  My mother has always said that survivors are always left behind to tell the story later.  Amen to this movie being made.  So what that parts may have been slow.  Can you imagine their day to day life of survival, year after year?  Don't be so critical, and take the story for what it is.  Yes, Hollywood was involved.  The love interest was true, and they married for the rest of their lives.  Who can say that anymore?  Making it through something like that together would most likely make you inseparable.  I hope those that have watched the movie learned something about true history, family life, dedication, and love.  Love of being alive in this wonderful world with friends and countrymen another God given day.  How strong are these people today?  They can work for me anytime.",1422316800,3,1955,4.463276836158192

3578488,3,B001FB55JO,"I had a poor DVD which hung up about half way through, but I haven't bothered to finish it.  I think the true history of the brothers is a bit less polished.  This is more of a fable with lots of dramatic license to make it a better story and more watchable.  And it is a better story this way and it is more watchable.  And if the story of the Jews fighting back moves you, then this is a great story.  If you want to see the split conscience between the brothers, one who will fight anyone, anytime, anywhere, and the other that wants to maintain a certain level of civilized behavior, then that story is told here.  Maybe I have just been going to the movies for too long.  It's good.  Maybe very good.  But not great.",1419552000,,721,4.129496402877698

Obviously, the story is told from the view of the Jews, but I liked how the director pointed out immediately that there was good and bad among them. I knew of the forest people, but not of this story. I didn't know they made an alliance (although tense) with the Russians. The movie portrays a group of individuals struggling for survival, who bond together for strength and companionship. There are people from all professions who make this a real community. The parallel to the story of Moses is strikingly apparent near the end, and then you see how the rest of the film connected. The acting, story line, directing - everything was perfectly done to tell this heartwarming survival tale. The director doesn't hold back. He shows the best and worst of humanity, which brings a sense of reality to the film. This passed the test of an excellent movie, because it would appeal to all audiences. It isn't a ""type"", like war, comedy, or action. It's a human story, which every human can relate to. Well done.",1417996800,,1037,4.672131147540983

3579773,4,B001FB55JO,"This movie was a well produced and emotionally moving story about the Russian freedom fighters and their struggle against the Germans during their attempt to dominate Europe and exterminate the Jews. while the movie was inspiring to see the Russians team up with the Jews who were able to escape the grasp of the German soldiers and fight for their freedom, it also stayed true to the facts of history as we know it.if I would give it one small critique, it would be that it leaned more towards the emotional struggles of the Jews while living in the forest and didn't show that struggle in correlation with the passage of time. I had no idea how long they lived under such harsh conditions until the very end of the movie when a quick written summary was given at the conclusion. All in all though, an excellent movie that I would watch again!",1415836800,,844,4.522875816993464

The turn of events and the strengths and weaknesses of some of its characters is interesting. This is the drama of the Polish Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell), and Aron (George MacKay) that struggled to save the lives of approximately 1200 Jews during the Nazi Holocaust in World War II. This was directed by Edward Zwick who directed GLORY, THE LAST SAMURAI AND LEGENDS OF THE FALL. Daniel Craig becomes the leader and gives a complex performance as someone who must be up for the challenge of leadership. He is at times restrained and at other times explosive. Liev Schreiber, giving a very strong performance, does not stay with the group, but instead joins a local company of Soviet partisans.

The subject matter itself, the targeting and destruction of Russian Jews and those who help them, is incredibly sad, and even further, this movie shows the really raw way that these 1,000 or so Jews were thrown together in the wilderness to survive and rebuild their lives. Throughout the film, we are witness to many true acts of bravery and courage. There really weren't any slow parts, it kept my interest the entire way through.

This movie has more grit and violence. I think it exhibits the despair and plight of the displaced Jews in a more raw form. More than once you do see the protagonists get payback on their pursuers. I thought Liev Schreiber turned in a great performance, not to take anything away from Daniel Craig as the lead.

Three brothers who were not about to be captured or killed by their enemies learn to survive while at the same time helping so many others on the run as well. It's very well acted and directed and kept my attention throughout the movie. Even if this was not based on true events it would still be a very good movie but the fact that it is absolutely true makes it an even better movie.  This movie shows us that there were many heroes during the war that unfortunately we have never really heard about.  The number of people saved by the heroic brothers was over twelve hundred resulting in an untold number of their offspring during the coming years after the war.

It also was an inspiration and showed the true spirit of human compassion and courage.  The underlying story of two brothers in conflict also made it very interesting and thought provoking.  One more ruthless than the other, one more compassionate than the other, but both with the same strong sense of survival and tendency to be leaders.

Don't be thwarted either by the book's cover; it's not as much of an action movie as it is a drama.  The story line is based more around the characters than it is around the war, the battles, etc.  Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell give excellent and convincing performances.",1412380800,,527,4.447916666666667

Humans do what it takes to survive and this movie portrays it very honestly. Calling the heroes of this movie thugs because they played by the same rules that everyone else did, just shows an underline bias.

Plus the pyrotechnics and armorers, technical military advisors were spot on regarding German Infantry tactics as well as Panzers were given full measure for their training and proficiency.  Partisans played a major role in the conflict long before D-Day!  We must never forget their guts and sacrifice in the face of almost certain death.

The main character is Daniel Craig playing Tuvia Bielski with Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell playing the other two Bielski brothers.  The acting by all three is incredible.

A great story of persecution, struggle and triumph.  My understanding from doing a little research after watching this is that the Poles were not too happy with the Bielski brothers and regarded them as outlaws but its easy to understand how people under complete duress will do whatever they need to do to survive. It also made me proud as an American to see at the end two of the brothers moved to NY after the war and ran a trucking business. if this country has greatness attributed to it, it is because of displaced and disenfranchised settlers like the Bielski's coming here and making a productive life for themselves.

3580913,5,B001FB55JO,"I can remember where I was and what I was doing when the announcement came over the radio that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. As a young boy, I had no concept of what that meant to the people of the United States. As the war progressed, people in this country were subjected to restrictions and rationing but were, by and large, directly untouched by the horrors of war.

This movie tells the story of those who were fully immersed in those horrors; of those who were the objects of focused attacks on their lives and all they had ever known. Specifically it tells the story of one Jewish family whose sons decided to try and save themselves from death. Their strength and determination attracted the attention of kindred spirits who joined them in their efforts to simply live and survive the horrors of war.

Their story, the story of the Bielski brothers, is told with power and conviction as they seek refuge in the forests and begin to attract others to join them. The movie is intense and sobering and will not be easily forgotten; it is rated R and has some scenes of violence that are consistent with war.

There is a fascinating extra that tells the story of the making of the movie; it is well done and definitely worth the time it takes to watch it. This movie provides some excellent insights into the mood and feelings of World War II; I recommend it for any who might have an interest in this era or a general interest in films portraying courage in the face of danger.

The movie is based on a true story and faces of the survivors are included in one of the extra features as well as brief summaries on what happened to them after the war.",1403740800,,1662,4.421568627450981

3580962,2,B001FB55JO,"American and Hollywood themes heavily injected, spoiling  the authenticity of the real story. Themes Such as: Hatred of Russia, display of excessive, confrontational and arrogant personality, and romanticizing Jews.
I've read the Book [a serious scholarly work] Defiance by Prof Nechama Teck upon which the film is supposedly made, The film and the book do not correspond, many scenes in the film are hugely Hollywood invented, as well as including  American Hollywood themes such as:
Hatred or negativity towards Russia: The Russian partisans depicted in the film are generally portrayed as bad, antisemitic characters. In reality  the picture was much more complex. The extensive  interactions of the Bielskis with other Soviet partisans in the area was very complex, involving  negative and positive sides as well. Danger from them as well as comradeship and assistance. It is a typical Hollywood lie that Russian partisan commander refused to inform the Bielskies of the big hunt, in reality they were very well informed.  One particularly disturbing  scene is where Tuvia sneaks into a ghetto and having an audience with ghetto inmates and its elders, trying to convince them to run away with him into the forest, Tuvia reassures them with: We have made an alliance with the Russian partisans. The leader of the ghetto dismissively responds with They are as bad as the Germans, you are too young to know the pogroms!. Nothing like that comes in the book by Teck [the real story], there was no such an exchange. I cant believe that any Jew in German occupied eastern Europe would have said something like that. If the Jews at that time had any hope on someone to come and save them, that one could only be the Soviets/Russia which indeed came in the end and saved whatether left, as well as probably saving much of the entire Slavic race from extermination in German hands. The western allies had no interest in stopping the Holocaust and they betrayed Poland and Czechoslovakia. The death camps were liberated by the Red Army who put a stop to the Holocaust. [By the way, I'm not a communist, but you cant deny history, it is a high time that both Jews and Poles come to acknowledge that the Soviets saved them from extinction]
Display of excessive, confrontational and arrogant personality: In the film, a rivalry is depicted between the two brothers, Zus and Tuvia , that even comes to fists and blows. Zus is shown as an  American Macho-man openly defying Tuvia with Arguments and his way. Again, in the book, nothing like that appears, no problem between the brothers. There were other serious internal problems in the Otriad, they were usually solved in military fashion, orders and court-marshals, even two executions.
Romanticizing of Jews: In the film, a central character is shown beside the 3 brothers, his name is Shimon. One is assumed that he is a Rabbi or other Jewish spiritual teacher, an orthodox Jew. No such a  figure is shown in the book, no such a Jewish spiritual central figure was there.
one scene shows a traditional Jewish wedding, the Rabbi officiating is the above Shimon. The wedding is even  complete with Klezmer music, a very nice and romantic scene. but again, in reality there were no such weddings there in the forests. Infact [according to the book by Teck], liberal and casual sex were the common practice there.
The only reason I give the film two stars is the positive side of the film- the excellent acting by Daniel Craig who gives some of the idea and flavour of the magnitude of the personality of Tuvia [who is the central focus of the book by Teck].",1392768000,5,3599,4.846905537459284

3581011,4,B001FB55JO,"There are things that I know are really good, such as Rembrandt's paintings, that I just don't like. On the other hand, there are Zwick's films like The Last Samurai and Legends of the Fall, which are kitsch both artistically and historically, but which I love. Therefore I sometimes have an issue with Amazon's rating system - I like this movie, though it rates three stars in terms of quality.

I think we are all old enough to know that in appealing to the broad American public in order to make money there are certain conventions which Hollywood adheres to. Sure, I would have preferred to see the Bielski Brothers portrayed as the very young men that they were during this period. Or to have the relationship [ established prior to the German invasion]and the political differences between the Bielskis' and the Red Army commanders explained rather than dumbed down to plain old antisemitism. Or not have Daniel Craig making Braveheart type speeches from astride his white horse, or take on a tank corps almost single- handed. And yet, despite that and despite the controversy about what the partisans did and didn't do or how they treated the peasantry, the subject of this film --survival instead of passive acceptance- is a fascinating and important one. The fact is, the times were terrible, groups splintered along ethnic, national and political lines, fought each other occasionally and all appropriated food from the peasantry. All did what they had to do to ensure their own survival and/or that of their group.

I really thought this was Craig's deepest role, and he did show torment, indecision, brutality along with kindness and remorse very well -angst, fear, and torment are hardly exclusive to more recent generations. Additionally his brother Zus was very candidly shown as a brutal man, callous toward the peasantry, relentless in his extermination of all those whom he perceived as being collaborators, and yet as a brave man who took up the gun to fight. What was so interesting to me was that this group, whatever its moral and ethical shortcomings in life, managed to form a community with a school, an infirmary, kitchens etc in the heart of the forest and lived to see the end of the war. Also interesting is that these people followed the Bielskis, [emerging as strong men in troubled times] whom they would have spurned for their lowly social position and rude ways prior to the war.  The forest btw and the scenery was absolutely gorgeous.",1378684800,2,2470,4.876190476190477

While taking refuge in the forests of Eastern Europe from the Nazis, the Jewish brothers managed to save at least 1200 Jews from enslavement and extermination.

When Tuvia and  return home to the family farm, they find their father dead and younger brothers hiding and they take off for the forest.  As the 4 brothers hide, they find other Jews who are in hiding.  Before you know it, Tuvia becomes a legend as the leader of a growing group fleeing for their lives.

There is a lot of violence, as the Jews fight to stay alive through hunger, illness, conflicts, and weather conditions.  Fortunately, it was not as explicit as many of today's modern movies -- not the extreme blood and guts flying around.  It is a touching movie about endurance and survival as Tuvia leads the group forward.

It is amazing to me that people, the Nazis, could be so evil and ruthless to other human beings.

3581084,5,B001FB55JO,"I rarely review movies or music since I feel both are very subjective. Additionally I might be wrong but, assume that most of you already have a good idea of the story line so I'm going to skip that as well.

In this case the acting was better than I expected and the story really kept a great pace. The look and feel of the film were also above my expectations with believable visuals in both the forest rural settings and towns. The cast have a realistic chemistry that helps the film to flow well and I feel the brothers dialog seems very natural, as do the relationships that evolve outside of the brothers. I found the story easy to get into with a good mix of action and romance which I feel make this a great film choice for men and women. In fact the bravery, respect and strength demonstrated in this film could be a good lesson for today's teens, let alone the true story this film was based on.

As someone else mentioned, the R rating is harsh and might have been given to this film simply to gain more of an audience. However I can say there is little or nothing in this film that I would not have allowed my early teenage children to see. In fact the violence was not as bad as I've seen in most action films that attract younger teens and up.

Over all I feel this is a very well paced action/romance. Well suited for anyone who would normally accept a PG-13 rating. The story was new to me but I was hooked early on and it kept my attention the whole time. The characters where inspiring and the film had a great look making you feel like you were peaking in on these brave and historic events.",1368316800,,1610,4.220779220779221

3581097,4,B001FB55JO,"Though it was a very good movie, I can't give it 5 stars because of substantial ""poetic license"" it took with historical accuracy.  That said, it did a good job in conveying the feel, the sense of what actually happened, what those people went thru, what they had to do to survive, and how the Bielskis were instrumental in that survival.  The casting/acting were excellent, the cinematography was very good, and the story line, though more Hollywood than history, gave one a good ""feel"" of what actually happened.

The Bielski's never sought recognition for what they did, however the descendents of the people they saved now number in the tens of thousands. The story is truly inspiring, as for the movie, it moved very slowly and like all war stories, was much too long. You quickly see that the story repeats itself over and over again.

 Furthermore, staying together, that following order out of chaos can overcome, and how strength if only limited in number, can act together to become a killer of Giants.
 At first, I was skeptical of watching for what I had thought to be another gory, tragic, sickening effects of the German War. However, this became one of the only true stories about the period that left you feeling joy instead of sorrow...at least in my personal opinion. Great movie...",1359244800,,614,4.838095238095238

He plays Tuvia Bielski, one of three brothers who kept a group of Jewish men, women, and children safe as they fought back against the Nazis in 1941. They ended up recueing hundreds of people.  If you're not into history and especially about Nazi Germany, then this movie is not for you.  It is gritty, but well done.",1358726400,,369,4.477611940298507

Cinema is God in action, that's why it is so powerful & magical. But it takes certain actors & actresses to be able to play those
Parts.
Films that are based on true stories are almost always inspirational as it gives us a somewhat sort of heads up to the events of the past.
Thank you to all the folks who were involved in the production & making of this film. If you liked this film, You might like ""Escape from Sobibor""  or  ""The Pianist"".

Right from the opening scene the movie grips you.  It is a little long, and some of the scenes could have been deleted and it would not of harmed the movie one bit.  I definetly recommend this movie for any person.  Good action, good drama, good romance.  Mixture of everything to keep you entangled in a movie.",1358467200,,478,4.488372093023256

But the overwhelming thing that I take from this movie is an even deeper sense of respect for Holocaust survivors.

3581181,5,B001FB55JO,"I'm not one to watch many movies or read a lot on the Holocaust due to the disturbing reality. But this movies showed another side of the story.

3581183,4,B001FB55JO,There are 250 reviews and counting with the average rating over 4 Stars. It is a good movie. World War 2 provides the back drop for so many stories because the conflict was so vast and far reaching that individual tales such as this can continue to emerge for years to come. This is based on a true story. Truth is stranger than fiction. Something Hollyweird ought to tap into. Some people had bizarre life experiences. It makes watching a movie more intense to know that it was someone's life experience. You can't help but think of yourself in a similar situation and how you might handle it. I am glad that I have not had to - to date. I like Daniel Craig. He gives a great performance. And at the current Amazon price of $4.96 - this movie is a steal.,1357171200,,755,4.286713286713287
3581184,4,B001FB55JO,I liked this movie.  I watched on an airplane from Orange County to Chicago.  It made the trip enjoyable. I had a little burn-out on Daniel Craig since I had watched Skyfall the day before.,1357084800,,189,4.371428571428571

3581199,5,B001FB55JO,"Over two hours of heart wrenching, death defying WWII action.  When watching a movie that was based on truth, many are quick to judge inaccuracies rather than just enjoying the movie.

I am not one of them.  Daniel Craig delivers and really provides the audience with a great performance.  I found myself getting so involved in the moral dilemma he faced, his fight with his brother and his desire to stay alive and defeat the Nazi oppression.

For a very little known story of WWII, one of heroism, watch Defiance.",1356739200,,515,4.677777777777778
3581200,4,B001FB55JO,"This film is dark, gritty, and violent, and in that way does justice to the bleak struggles of the era. It's not exactly feel-good, but it's not depressing either. It ends on a note of triumph rather than despair, and what makes it a great movie to me are the relationships, the bond between the brothers and the cooperation of the entire group to keep each other safe.
On a personal note, my sister and I love this film because she is a big fan of Jamie Bell and we both adore Daniel Craig, and both actors turn out excellent performances.",1356739200,,540,4.356435643564357

I won't rehash the plot in my review; you can read other reviews for that, or the description on Amazon.

The R rating is for violence and language. However, I didn't feel either one was over-the-top or excessive. I thought the language was mild; sometimes it was hard to tell if a person was swearing due to their accent; sometimes it was translated as subtitles; and other times it was plainly spoken.  But I didn't think the language was gratuitous or excessive.

3581209,4,B001FB55JO,"Loved the movie when we saw it in theaters--Real life stories are much more interesting than the drivel that Hollywood cranks out- all action, all special effects-  not giving much thought to a storyline of real people involved in real life situations- and the choices one makes... or does not.

Anyway, The freedom fighters launch a guerilla war against the German's in an attempt to salvage supplies and regain their liberty. This story is very dramatic. It's got great action drama, suspense, and a bit of romance. Liev Schreiber also stars in this fantastic film. I think that he's one of the most underrated actors around these days.

Obviously its a compressed, Hollywood dramatization of very compelling historical accounts, but it left me scratching my head on several occasions. How much time just passed? Where did all that come from? etc. You have to fill in quite a few holes yourself, and be content to accept some unanswered questions while the movie marches on. (And if you've read Sun Tzu and Machiavelli, you may imagine yourself handling some of the situations very differently.) Finally, I found the portrayal of Jewish faith very authentic from a humanistic standpoint, but generally lacking expression and integrity. Fortunately the story and ending are both incredible and inspiring, and this is a very good movie overall. Of course the core premise - and most troubling - is that man is capable of focusing such intense evil (for there is no other way to describe it) toward his fellow man purely on the basis of religion.

There's enough here for a dozen movies but Hollywood cannot make even one that is rooted in the truth. Instead the movie makers have borrowed all their ideas for this movie from other movies.  We see beautiful, crying women, men, brave but flawed, shouting and fighting. The predictable script carries us through every inch of the predictable action.  We have seen all of these characters elsewhere, the young inexperienced intellectual, the brave child, the courageous but infirm old man, the hard-bitten commander, the selfish coward, the bold strong woman.

I've been to the Holocaust Museum in DC as well. There are so many stories of people helping others survive persecution during the war. Every time I discover a new one I'll watch the movie or read the book. This movie was inspirational because it showed how they chose to fight for their survival rather than wait to be exterminated by a government that wanted to rid Europe of Jewish people. I'm glad they make movies like this because it shows how communities can unite to help each other and how we all need each other to have hope. The Rabbi in the story said something profound, too. He said that the war had almost made him lose his faith in God, but the Bielski brothers restored his belief. I loved the way they alluded to having to cross the water to freedom and how it was like when Moses parted the Red Sea. A very inspirational film. Those brave brothers led a movement that allowed 1200 people to survive the war. Two or three people can make a difference when their leadership inspires others to live. Great acting too!

It follows the four Jewish Bielski brothers during the occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany after their parents were killed by Germans.

3581303,4,B001FB55JO,"This ambitious film is excellent with multiple themes interwoven into a strong narrative. I finished the film feeling that I had seen a great film. The film is complex and multiple issues are explored, but it is a testament to the director, writers, cinematographers, and actors that it comes together in a powerful multi-layered statement.

One theme that is addressed is Jewish resistance to the Holocaust. We are here offered an account of resistance to this horror. A second theme is the competition between brothers, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, who respond in different ways to the horror that has been imposed on them and thus respond in different ways to the call of leadership when either hiding refugees in the Byelorussian forest or searching for Nazis with an advance of the Red Army. A third theme, which is carefully developed throughout the film, is that of leadership. Tuvia Bielski plays a Moses figure, leading the people through a wilderness and maintaining order and calm under terrible conditions. Frequently in the film I thought of the Exodus and the Jewish people struggling in the wilderness.

In addition to showing the resistance of some Jewish communities, the film also shows the heartless collaboration of local communities once invaded by the Nazis. The Nazis had collaborators and honesty about this is a strength of the film.

Overall the film is excellent entertainment which explores terrible events in human history and points to some of the honor and courage and intelligence required to outlive the terror and survive.",1310515200,,1550,5.094488188976378
3581304,4,B001FB55JO,"Little is known about the Bielski brothers and their campaign to save over 1,200 Jews by hiding them in the forests of western Belarus after the Nazis steamrollered their way through in the 1941 invasion against Russia. Even Tuvia himself, who was later living out the rest of his life as an American citizen until his death in 1987, barely acknowledged his own heroics in doing so. The movie shows plenty into their lives spent in that forest, their suffering from little food, the little acknowledgement of their deeds by nearby Russian partisan units that also attacked the Germans, and the constant terror that each citizen had knowing that they could be driven out by the German military and Nazi-allied police.
After watching this movie, I sought more information by ordering one of the books on the Bielski brothers and reading each page carefully while on a vacation. I had to take off a star for this review because when you watch the movie, it shows the massive German advance of an entire army division to drive the Jews out from their forest settlements sometime in the spring of 1942, where the entire population crosses through a murky swamp and then a face-off against German infantry with tank support. Much of this DID happen, but the attempt by the Nazis to drive them out with such military support was not attempted until the early summer of 1943, which was a full year off the mark when you compare the movie scenes with the book. Plus, it took several months following the German invasion, with the three brothers hiding out in different towns and homes of friends, before they got the idea to rescue people from the ghetto prisons and make such settlements in the forests, when the movie makes out these same ideas to be planned shortly after the invasion. The lack of historical accuracy on those two parts alone gives it a four-star rating, otherwise, it's an excellent movie!
Sadly, what I found out from the book is that despite Tuvia's experience as a former corporal in the peacetime Polish Army and his loyalty to the Communist Party(or do I dare say tolerance), and his brothers serving in the Red Army before their units were dispersed sometime after the invasion, the Soviet police following their occupation of the Belarus region in July, 1944, treated Tuvia and his family with some contempt and much suspicion, leading Tuvia and his surviving family members to believe that they would soon be arrested, which led to them leaving the country for good after the war to settle in Israel and then the United States. With the number of descendants from the Jews that the brothers helped to rescue numbering in the tens of thousands by this day alone, a lot more recognition should be gained on what these three brothers did in their part to save so many.
One who saves one life...end up saving an entire nation. And these three ended up saving 1,200 Jews, not to mention ambushing and killing some 500 German soldiers and their allies. Let us remember this story and pass it on!",1308182400,,3009,4.733333333333333

3581306,3,B001FB55JO,"This movie was recommended to me by my Jewish American friend, who was proud to present the story of Jewish resistance in World War II.

 After I watched the movie I told him that I don't like how  Russian partisans were presented in the movie. His question then stunned me. He asked ""And what Russian's were doing there during World War II"". Well I answered him, apparently during World War II those weird Russians were drinking vodka a lot, were making stupid jokes, were abusing poor Jewish guys and movie described all this - the only thing they forgot to mention that it was Russians who defeated Nazi Germany and it was only because of Russian sacrifice that Jewish refugees didn't had to stay in the forest forever.
Poor American kids apparently they don't learn history in school.

So while having a good story producers of the film didn't escape Hollywood stereotypes about good Americans (who somehow present Eastern European Jews in the movie) and weird cartoon  Russians more suitable for some stupid comedy, than for the serious World War II movie.

3581307,5,B001FB55JO,"I picked up to see this movie, because it is based on a true story.  Set in Belorussia during WWII, movie starts in 1941 event when Germans with the help of the local militia start killings of the Jews in Belorussia.  Two (Jewish) brothers who both lost their families during the initial extermination effort by Germans decide to start resisting to the forces determined to eliminate Jews from the area either by mass murder or deportations to the concentration camps.  These two simple men, peasants are soon joined by civilian Jews from surrounding areas who find themselves more willing to live ina wild forrest than accept the faith that Germans have in mind for them.

As movie progresses it is amazing to observe anti-semitism as it exist in Red Army.  There are internal struggles in the newly founded Jewish community.  There is a power stuggle on who will be commander of the camp, and there are cultural and social differences between intellectuals and the working class Jews.  As the number of the people in the camp grows so are the challenges to find food, medicine and shelter for them all.  Local peasants are divided in who to help: Red Army or Jewish ""bandits"" as they are labeled.  There is definitely a moral dilemma on how to apprach this effort in survival.  Is diplomacy the way to go, or do they have to resort to force in order to overcome their enemies.

Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber give impressive performances of two brothers who are polar opposites in the way they approach their survival methods.  I did find confusing at times when actors would use Russian, English and German interchangebly and movie would sometimes loose its natural flow.",1304899200,2,1675,4.7979094076655056
3581308,4,B001FB55JO,"Edward Zwick has mastered the knack of making movies with emotional resonance, combined with well edited sequences depicting battles and action.  This movie is no exception, telling the story of the three Bielski brothers in Belarus, during the Second World War.  At a time when the Nazis were rounding up the Jewish families for the ghettos and concentration camps, murdering tens of thousands as they went, these brothers survived and fled into the forests they knew so well.  They are an anachronism, Jews who did not share the view of the majority of peaceful resistance.. they fought for their freedom living a harsh life in the forest under constant threat.
Zwick certainly elicits some strong performances from each of the three brothers.  Daniel Craig, who becomes the de facto leader -  the compassionate one, and Liev Schreiber outstanding as the brother who wants to take the fight to the Germans.  Jamie Bell is also good but makes less of an impact as the third and youngest brother, undergoing a loss of innocence.  The satisfying part of the story is the first half as we really explore these flawed characters - unwilling leaders whose true character emerges, in spite of perceptions of others, and even perceptions they had about themselves.  It never becomes dull, but it does become more `by-the-numbers' once the Germans are closing in and we get to the final battle, and things get tied up a little less ambiguously than the tone the movie starts out with.
The relationship with the Russians, what happened to those who sheltered or aided the Jewish survivors, the harshness of conditions the survivors endured and the numbing effect of the killing and futility of revenge are all ably explored.  Its real resonance however, lies in the knowledge of it being a true story, portraying a side of the story of Jewish persecution in WW II that is lesser known - and an important counterpoint to the common images and tales of the period.  It's just a pity that the director tells it quite so straight, using visual and audio styles and cues that feel more borrowed than original.  It remains a movie that is worthwhile and well put together, even if stopping short of being a classic.",1302307200,,2201,4.842666666666666
3581309,4,B001FB55JO,"This film, set in World War II on the Eastern Front (not well known to Americans), includes a fine performance by Daniel Craig, stunning photography of the forests, and the portrayal of Jews as fighters not victims.  These are strong pluses in this memorable film produced by Edward Zwick.

As the film ended, however, I was not quite satisfied.  The film only touched lightly on some of the large moral questions it introduced.  The screenplay gave glimpses of real dilemmas without probing them more deeply.  Among them:

--  ""Forest wives.""
--  Treatment of prisoners captured by the Jewish fighters and other partisans.
--  ""Equal rations for all"" when some contributed more to seizing the food needed by the community.
--  Treatment of local peasants, related to the larger question of whether ""if you're not for us, you're against us.""
--  While opposing the horror of the Nazi war and racial machine, sorting out the conflicting claims of loyalty and identity -- Polish (the area they came from had belonged to Poland before the war), Belarusian, Soviet, and Jewish.
--  Executions -- both of prisoners and those who challenged the camp leadership.
--  ""No infants allowed.""

Sitting comfortably in a living room nearly seventy years after the events portrayed in the film, one hesitates to second guess decisions made at the time.  None of us were there, many of the choices were between evils, and a few lines or scenes in a film don't do justice to the awful dilemmas forced on the partisan band and its leaders.  In the forests of Byelorussia, occupied by the Nazis, the Bielski partisans lived in a severely constricted and pressured moral universe, caught in the midst of a murderous war between the Nazi and Soviet dictatorships.  Life and death were the stakes.  Peacetime moral strictures were distant from the immediate needs of survival.

Even so, memoirs, historical novels, and films implicitly revisit choices made in the past.  In ""Defiance,"" the screenplay develops and honors some of the moral decisions like ""equal rations for all.""  But it mutes the treatment of other issues.  Different viewers may have different misgivings, but I found the non-judgmental treatment of ""forest wives"" discomforting because it was so casual.

More depth on some of the moral issues in the film, moreover, might better illustrate the meaning of ""lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.""  ""Temptation"" in the prayer may be understood as ""trial"" or ""test,"" and it asks the Almighty to spare an individual from the perilous situations that require denial, compromise, and bad choices.

Watch ""Defiance,"" then, for more than its history, photography, and performances.  Talk over the issues it touches on.  Understand that in societies less fortunate than ours, in times more perilous, people considered mere ""questions"" or ""issues"" as blessed luxuries, for they lived in circumstances that required answers.

3581310,4,B001FB55JO,"This is a true story, in which a pair of brothers distinguished themselves in guerilla-warfare against German occupation during World War II.

In the wake of Operation Barbarosa (the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941), the National Socialist party deployed Einsatzgruppen, S.S. units whose mission was extermination of specified ethnicities in Eastern Europe. The primary target were the Jewish communities.

In the Belarus S.S.R., the Bielski brothers took to the woods, rather than be shipped off to imminent death in a concentration-camp. Many others followed them, usually with nothing more than the clothes they wore.

One of the brothers joined a unit of Russian partizans, after a family altercation. The other led the small community of survivors who established a hidden encampment deep in the forest. The refugees in this camp frequently starved and froze. They had very little in medical assets, and there was no shortage of illness. The most savage combat in the European theater surged all around them. Their fellow Soviet Citizens had little sympathy or blatant hostility toward them. In the end, a German army unit located and over-ran their encampment, but the group made a spectacular fighting withdrawal. Despite the harsh odds, ...they survived!

Many descendants of the Bielski group are alive and well in America and Isreal, because their parents had the guts to prevail!

I only wish the film was longer and covered more of the guerilla-warfare actions that this valorous community participated in, but you can only fit so much into a standard movie.",1301788800,,1582,5.21259842519685

This film has plenty of fight scenes for those who enjoy a typical war film, as well as more emotional scenes of romance, loss and betrayal to round off the film more fully. This has a good storyline and it has even more impact when you realise that it is based upon real events. I felt the film occasionally dragged in the middle part but not excessively so and any slow sections were quickly forgotten when the action got going again. This film really shows the struggle this group went through and you are left in awe at their tenacity and will to survive. From starvation, typhoid and the constant threat of discovery they had so many adversities it really makes you think about the hardships these people must have endured. This is directed by Edward Zwick who is renowned for his gritty and realistic style and this film is no exception. Overall this has excellent performances from all involved and manages to keep your attention for the duration. It has human interest, excitement and real emotion and is worth checking out at some point.

3581320,5,B001FB55JO,"Wonderful a story is Defiance as was Schindler's List both true and each a story of a couple people doing all they can to save and not allow the Holocaust destroy all those that were victims, specifically the Jews. In a different manner but, much in the same goals as Oscar Schindler did in saving whom he could during WWII at great risk and sacrifice, the Bielski Brothers whom in their own survival as Jews become leaders and selfless in saving fellow Jews from certain demise. They lead well over 1000 Polish Jews in the forests of eastern Europe through the length of the war. Dealing with hunger, illness, the cold elements, enemy patrols and attacks along with at times internal conflicts, these people proved to be true survivors and follow their leader into uncertain but freedom under the most challenging hurdles. With the elder brother Tuvia Bielski along with his brothers, many people were saved.

This movie is well made, acted, written, and, directed. The cinematography is unmatched, and, the realism of the entire movie seems so realistic, it is as if one could find themselves as witnesses of every part of this film. There is no lulls or dead or slow points within the movie. The entire film is rich with great acting and scenes that doesn't miss a beat. Many of the actors/actresses are unknown to us with the exception of Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and a couple others, but, this independent film surely carries it's own so well that the unknown actors surely do such a marvelous job and do great justice to their roles, that it makes this true story well told via this cinematography.

I would recommend this film very highly to others, and, is in a class all its own. I have seen it now 3 times, and, each time I have watched it, is as fresh as the first time. What a great revelation of this little known story that is true, yet, sends a great message of humanity under the greatest of challenges.",1294704000,,1924,4.62280701754386
3581321,5,B001FB55JO,"An excellent depiction of how one set of Russian Jewish brothers took to the forest. They eventually saved many others. They struggled with no only the elements but also the military forces searching for them. They did NOT lay themselves down, but took up arms against the Nazi attacks. This is an emotional DVD filled with huge amounts of suspense, drama, romance, action, and dramatized history.

This story is based upon the life of a real set of brothers, and what they experienced and how they went about saving themselves, friends, other Jews, and carving their own heroic piece of history out of the suffering in World War Two. Highly recommended for war history lovers, and those who wish to be enlightened.

The lead role Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig-'James Bond') is excellent in the acting and emotion, but lacks skills at speaking Russian. My daughter-in-law, Russian born, could understand the limited amounts of Russian spoken by other actors, but not that of Tuvia. Don't worry, English subtitles are provided when needed, which is seldom, since the players speak mostly English.

3581322,4,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" is a remarkable film based on the true story about the four Bielski brothers who fled their small farm in Poland during WWII when the Nazi regime invaded their village killing their parents and many other Jews in the village.  The brothers fled to the Belarusian National Forest forging a group of resistance fighters to provide a safe haven for Jewish refugees. Defiance tells the untold story of a group of Jews who fought to avoid the harshness of life in labor camps or even worse murder.

Although an estimated six million Jews were murdered between 1942-1945 (War Witness 2010) this movie shows us that there was more than one fate for the Jews. Some did manage to flee and make a life for themselves outside of the camps during those horrible days.  The life in the forest was not an easy life for the Jews who managed to find refuge there, but it was a life that they defined for themselves not one dictated to them by someone else.",1292716800,,951,4.549707602339181

Except this time it is civilians trying to escape from the Germans if I can't remember correctly.  Either way if you don't mind a little gore, this movie is pretty good.  There is one really violent scene in the movie which is the most disturbing when he goes and gets some paper from a guy's house so beware.",1290902400,2,600,4.2105263157894735
3581324,5,B001FB55JO,"First off, I loved this film.  Great casting, writing, and acting.  Beautifully photographed.

So this really IS a minor complaint, but it's one that encompasses a plethora of films with battle scenes.  In truth, the engagements that take place at a distance were well done.  But the ambushes of Germans on lorries are not believable in the sense that they tend to go on forever, with the camera shifting back and forth between the Russians and Germans.  In fact, in the situations depicted, it would have been over in 30 seconds at the most with all Germans quickly killed.  Then there was the Stuka attack.  The bombs explode with all the power of a poorly constructed pipe bomb.  In truth, depending on the size carried, the bombs from a Stuka would create explosions ranging from the size of a small house to that of a medium sized building.

The ambushes were undoubtedly drawn out for dramatic effect and it is probable that the tiny explosive charges used to simulate the bombing run were necessary to ensure the safety of the actors or stunt people ( or to satisfy the actors' unions or other official agencies ).

Again, not a huge deal.  But I find it unfortunate when all else is top-notch how these types of errors are repeatedly made in war films, taking just a bit of the sheen off otherwise excellent productions.",1288396800,2,1328,4.652360515021459
3581325,4,B001FB55JO,"This is a great movie. It is a story that should be told and should be known by everyone. The acting was also good. However, I was left somewhat unsatisfied. I thought after seeing it that more should have been told about how the brothers fought against the Nazis, rather than spending so much time on the rift between them. I was somewhat bothered by the jump in the story, as if the narrator was saying, ""so it continued for more than a year and then..."" A lot must have happened during the year. What happened? What also bothered me about this otherwise fine film, was that I remember reading that the two surviving brothers came to the US and were cab drivers, and few people knew of their remarkable history. This fact says a lot. It speaks about their humility. I was bothered that this characteristic was not in the film.",1287446400,3,828,4.453947368421052
3581326,5,B001FB55JO,"There is a myth, long-standing, that the Jews of Europe submitted passively to their fate at the hands of the Nazis and their willing helpers during World War II. According to this myth, Jewish resistance to the Holocaust did not exist, except perhaps in the Warsaw Ghetto, an anomalous, dramatic exception to a nightmarish reality in which Jews blandly climbed on board trains to be taken to unspeakable places to face an unspeakable fate.

Fortunately, that myth is being exploded sixty years after the fact, and DEFIANCE, the story of the Bielski Partisans, is part of that process. The Bielski Partisans were led by the brothers Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron, Jews from White Russia (now Belarus), who took to the woods after their village was targeted by the Einsatzkommando ""B"", an SS killing corps.

Many Jews, in fact, fled to the woods, and Jewish Resistance arose in many places throughout Europe. The Bielski experience in the dense Naliboki Forest is paradigmatic. The Jews of city and town, often tradesmen, small business owners, or scholar/intellectuals, were generally ill-equipped for the rough life of forest-dwellers. In this regard, the Bielskis, whose father had been a countryman, were peculiarly suited to lead. Having grown up in and around the woods and with a familiarity with tools and weapons, they became not only protectors but teachers in the art of survival.

Tuvia (Daniel Craig) became the leader, quiet, intense, sincere, and often in a quandry both moral and practical. How does one lead men, and care for women and children in conditions of deprivation? How and when does a leader lead or let himself be guided?  How does a leader, as an authority, assert that authority?

Tuvia ""would rather save one old Jewish woman than kill a dozen Nazis,"" but he is no milquetoast. He takes vengeance on the local Russian officer responsible for killing his parents. Nazis paid a bounty to those who betrayed their Jewish neighbors. Jews were worth 500 rubles a head, a small fortune to many starving peasants. Much later, he settles a challenge to his leadership from within by executing the mutineer.

Craig, known for his role as James Bond, really shows that his talents are wasted as the suave British spy. As Tuvia Bielski, he shines, an ordinary man called upon to do extraordinary things.

His younger, bigger, tougher brother, Zus (Liev Schreiber) is a firebrand. Although the Bielski Partisans engage small ""hunting parties"" in firefights, Zus believes the battle can be better fought on a larger scale, and joins the Red Partisans. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism within the Soviet ranks makes him an outsider, and he eventually returns to his brothers.

Schrieber, whose physical presence is imposing, plays Zus by tapping into some deep reservoir of anger within himself. It's an impressive performance, by far the strongest in the film.

Asael is younger, as is Aron, and both younger brothers dedicate themselves to forming a structured community for the growing forest community, establishing schools for the children, an infirmary for the ill, workshops for non-combatants, where they repaired rifles, loaded cartridges, sewed clothing, and built shelters and bunkers, and foraging parties that collected (by hook or by crook) food, tools, and other necessaries from the locals.

There are a number of large-scale battles between the German Army (supplied with tanks, machine guns and half-tracks) and the woefully underarmed Bielskis, which the Partisans, impossibly, win. Most of these battles have been ""amplified"" by the screenwriters for dramatic impact.

In all, some 1,200 Jews survived the war with the Bielski brothers. Asael Bielski was not among them. This film sheds light on a little-known chapter of the Holocaust, a chapter which had its counterparts in and around Kovno, Vilna, Warsaw, Lodz, Kiev, and in Western Europe as well.

This story, though it took place in Belarus, was filmed just across the border in Lithuania due to political reasons. As my father was a survivor of the Shoah from Lithuania, I was particularly interested in experiencing the views of the Lithuanian countryside this film provided.",1286755200,121,4163,5.160237388724036

The only 'downside' to B/R... at least THIS DVD... is that the audio output from the player must be designed to 'drive' some Home Theater style audio system. Output audio, driving the HD-TV audio system, is  **JUST** strong enough to be 'usable'... if nobody in the room is talking. I was told that B/R lacked audio, for a simple system, and it seems so.

I'm not in a position to comment on its accuracy regarding the actual events but it was a solid representation of the persecution of the Jews, the colaborators, difficult living conditions in the forest, and in particular partisans. The battle scenes included ambushes, raids and a confrontation with a tank (I don't know what it started as but it was a creditable reconstruction of a Mk IV). The battle scenes were fine - appropriately savage and when the German army proper entered the fray, they were clearly the 'A' team. There were a few Stukas too! I liked Daniel Craig's work in it all. Sure there were cliches and relationship sidetracks but it's hard to avoid these. There was some interesting material on some of the complexities of the time, like dealing with the Communist partisans and the impact of the Holocaust.

3581347,4,B001FB55JO,"One wonders why it took so long for the story of the Bielski brothers, sensible and steady Tuvia (Daniel Craig), hot-headed Zus (Live Schreiber) and peace-maker Asael (Jamie Bell) and their partisan band, who hid out in the forests of Belarus during World War II. Eventually, the brothers gathered to them a self-sufficient band of refugees from the nearby Jewish ghetto of Stankiewicze - that part of Poland taken over by the Soviets at the beginning of the war. Eventually, the Nazis and their `final solution' came to the Bielski's home; the older brothers were already living in the woods, and in the very first scenes of the movie, they return to find their parents dead, and their youngest brothers hiding in a makeshift bunker under a haystack.

The movie outlines the growth of the Bielski partisans and the clash between the two brothers. Only relatively small portions of the band were active fighters; the focus as Tuvia sees it, is to protect their people, their fellow Jews; their surviving friends and neighbors, and those whom he has managed to convince him to leave the dubious shelter of the ghetto and follow him into the woods. Tuvia resorts to banditry and violence when pressed, to feed and supply those whom he has taken responsibility for; he will also take swift revenge on the family of the Polish collaborator responsible for killing his parents. Zus just wants to kill Nazis: he will go and fight with a Soviet-led partisan band, rather than shepherd a miserable band of town-bred intellectuals through a brutal winter in the woods.

An excellent touch in this movie is the realistic way that life in the forest is depicted: not just as a sort of long-term experience of camping out in the summer - when the woods are beautiful, misty green -  but also the having to endure brutal near-Siberian winters. It is made very clear that existence then is one long misery, of dirt, semi-starvation and cold. The move itself was filmed not fifty miles away from where it all took place, in a similar forested setting. Refreshingly and realistically also, the characters generally appear unkempt, ragged and dirty, and the males indifferently shaven for much of the movie. And the occasional explosions during the moments of combat are realistically understated; no spectacular fiery clouds.

The one aspect lacking in this account is some kind of explanation of why Tuvia and his brothers were adept as leaders, and so well-disposed to hiding out in the woods in the first place. It might have been a bit more artful in the story-telling to have set up a bit more of the Bielski's back-story, to have shown a bit more of what they were doing before the war, of their milieu as small farmers, on the edge of the woods, and gone into a little more of their personal losses. Tuvia and Zus are depicted as being in their thirties, after all; they would have had meaningful adult lives, careers, wives and children. Briefly revealing those elements, instead of just a bare mention in brief dialog would have added an extra dimension to the story. It appears that Tuvia had served in the Polish Army, and that as the war ramped up, he and Zus may have been active as smugglers - which would account for them being in the woods in the first place, and disinclined to cooperate with law and order in the second. All in all, an interesting movie venture in telling a relatively unknown story.",1269043200,,3402,4.751269035532995
3581348,2,B001FB55JO,"Defiance: 4 out of 10: I have a soft spot for director Edward Zwick. I have a real soft spot for his Blood Diamond flick despite its pedestrian script and subconscious racism. In addition, The Last Samurai is another film of his that I loved despite its historical inaccuracies and bizarre lead casting. Defiance shares many of the same endemic faults that plagued those two films. I was not able to brush off the faults this time; I found them even more discordant as the film went on.

Problem number one is Daniel Craig. He does not look like an Eastern Polish Jew. He looks like he misplaced his Oberstleutnant uniform at the Wehrmacht's cleaners. Even if you were able to accept Daniel Craig as some sort of Paul Newman style Jew who parachuted into Eastern Europe, only Helen Keller would buy him as Lev Schreiber's brother. A mutant dancing Australian with adamantium claws is a more believable brother for Schreiber than Craig is.

In fact, Craig and Schreiber seem to be in two different films and Schreiber is in the much better one. Schreiber seems to be in the here and now with a strong subtle performance that is the best thing in the film. Daniel Craig's performance is as shaky as his accent. He, of course, is forced to do things like give Braveheart speeches from the back of a white horse, so the fault is hardly his alone. And saying platitudes such as 'Our vengeance is to live"" and ""Every day of freedom is like an act of faith"" while gazing at the camera with those, just give me an Oscar and I will go back to entertaining you, baby blues doesn't help his cause either.

Problem number Two is best summarized by one of my favorite ladies:

""I don't think we really need another film about the Holocaust, do we? It is like, how many have there been, you know. We get it. It was grim. Move on. No, I am doing it because I have noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust you are guaranteed an Oscar ... That is why I am doing it. Schindler's bloody List. The Pianist. Oscars coming out of their arse.""

' Kate Winslet (Winner of the 2008 Best Actress Oscar for Holocaust drama The Reader) in Extras, 2005

Defiance is clearly Oscar bait. In one scene Daniel 'Moses' Craig leads his people through the reeds and swamps and away from the forest (and inexplicably away from decent cover and fortifications) until a Rabbi collapses, sputters out ""I almost lost my faith but you were sent by God to save us' and then promptly dies... oy vey. It really is not that easy to make a mainstream Holocaust film, release it in December, and get no nominations* for Golden Globes or Oscars. Defiance is clearly trying too hard.

The third problem is that a third rate cast of Fiddler on the Roof somehow showed up lost in the woods. Somebody call the Jewish stereotype prison, cause there has been a mass escape. Everyone is here. The nebbish intellectual who cannot hammer a nail, the passive Jews who are unwilling to fight, the greedy Jew more interested in money than his fellow man. Good lord, it is as if Leni Reisenthal's travelling troop of clichs showed up. Thank goodness, Daniel Craig is here to straighten them all out and lead them to the Promised Land. Yup blond, blue eyed, Daniel Craig'. Yeah the movie has issues.

3581350,4,B001FB55JO,"I was completely unaware of this chapter of WWII history.

Having recently watched this movie with my 14-year old son, I found it quite moving. My son is in a 'guns-are-awesome' period, and I think this movie (thankfully) put a slight damper on his ardor. For me, I haven't been this haunted by a movie since I saw ""Platoon"" in college in the late '80's. (Not a bad thing to be haunted by a movie, methinks.)

While I'm sure this movie is far from accurate (the final scene with the tank was a bit over-the-top), the gift this movie gives is bringing the story of these Polish survivors to the world.  The acting was first rate ... I very much enjoyed watching the brothers interact with each other. Hollywood machismo was (happily!) tossed aside here. These brothers struggle, cry, disagree, reunite, fight, embrace and kiss.

How wonderful to see movie stars act like real men for a change. Daniel Craig, for instance, was so much more three dimensional in this movie than in any of his Bond films (films which are fun to watch when you're in the mood for such things. They are just more 2 dimensional).

I think this would be an excellent film for college and groups for discussion of community and honor and right choices ... and so much more. My son and I watched this movie on DVD. There were several places where we stopped the movie and had interesting, ""Ok, you are Tuvia. What would you do right now?"" conversations. (My son puts up with a lot from me. ;-D)

I certainly intend on reading the book to learn more about these brave people who lived in the woods for over 2 years to escape the horrors of the Holocaust.

3581353,4,B001FB55JO,"Hidden amongst the multiple film histories that litter the movies, occasionally you'll find a gem of a story that surprises the hell out of you. And DEFIANCE is definitely one of those. Based on the real-life story of the Bielski brothers who helped hide and save over 1,000 Jews from the Nazi death camps, this story is told in an unflinching narrative with brutal acts alongside those of extreme courage.

We often hear that reality can be stranger (and grander) than fiction, and here this holds doubly true. For not only did the Bielski brothers do this amazing ordeal, they also didn't ask for any recognition, reward, or medals. They married and immigrated after WW II ended and decided to live out quiet lives in their little corners of the world (with the exception of one brother who was conscripted into the Soviet army and died in battle).

But fate has a strange way of finding heroes, and this time was no exception. A documentary in 2006 entitled The Bielski Brothers: Jerusalem in the Woods was aired on the History Channel, and two books about them can easily be found, too. As word of what they'd done passed down through generations of survivors (now numbering in the tens of thousands), Hollywood took notice and sought out their history. Not having to embellish much (if at all) this incredible story, a screenplay was rapidly approved, director Ed Zwick (BLOOD DIAMOND) attached, and the rest is ...well ...history.

Daniel Craig (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B001PPLIFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>) takes the lead role as brother Tuvia, a man with a military past and Jewish roots. When his parents and friends are killed by Nazi hunters and sympathizers, Tuvia and brothers Zus (Liev Schreiber,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Painted-Veil/dp/B000NOIX48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Painted Veil</a>), Asael (Jamie Bell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-2005/dp/B001KZVQJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong, 2005</a>), and young Aron (George MacKay) head into the woods for safety. But vengeance versus fear drives what will come next. Tuvia kills his parents' murderers and then ducks deeper into the forests around Belarus. And with him comes other Jews fleeing the Nazi slaughters. Playing a game of hide-and-seek with their tormentors, The Bielski brothers and their followers didn't just cower in fear, but stood up and launched occasional attacks against the German troops. But their greatest victory was surviving and thriving in their forest hideouts. By wars end, they had not only survived, but multiplied and thrived.

Fascinating.

To this day, I often wonder if Hitler is turning over in his grave over this. I think he is. And what a wonderful form of revenge that is. Not because it took some violence on the Jews part to achieve it, but because violence wasn't their primary goal. It was survival. Surviving ""The Final Solution"" was the one thing Hitler most certainly wouldn't have wanted. And not only did the Bielski brothers and their followers achieve it, they added to their numbers. Sweet revenge!

Daniel Craig does a superb job as Tuvia, including a very believable accent. As does Liev Schreiber as his embittered brother Zus. In fact, I can't think of a single actor/actress that didn't live up to their part in this film. It was a gem to find amongst the forest of other movies out there.",1262908800,4,3526,5.520370370370371

3581359,5,B001FB55JO,"It is 1941.  Nazi Germany has invaded Soviet Russia, straight through the Soviet Republic of Belorussia.  Three Jewish brothers, Tuvia, Zus, and Asael Bielski (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell), take refuge in the nearby forests. They are joined, more or less by accident, by other members of their Jewish community.  It falls to the three brothers to take charge and defy the odds to save the lives of their fellow refugees.

Such is the premise of 2009's ""Defiance"", which shines a light on a obscure corner of World War Two's Eastern Front.  Trapped behind the German lines, the Bielski group must battle lack of food and shelter, a harsh winter, and the vicious tactics of the German Army.  They get little help from the local Soviet partisan group, which regards them with suspicion.

The narrative proceeds on parallel tracks.  The otherwise ordinary Bielski brothers must grow, painfully, into leaders, while their fellow refugees struggle to maintain their sense of community under the most difficult of conditions.  The interactions between the brothers ring true, thanks to some solid acting.  Some of the best moments of the movie are the efforts of the people of the forest to fashion a new, if precarious, life for themselves in the midst of war.

""Defiance"" narrates some painful events that may be difficult to watch.  The partisan battle may be unknown to the average viewer, who is encouraged to explore the extra features explaining the history behind the movie.

3581365,5,B001FB55JO,"This brilliant movie tells the true story of the Bielski partisans -- a band of Jewish survivors who hid in the forests of Belorussia during World War II and fought the Nazis.

It comes with all the bells and whistles of a classic war movie but it's so much more that that -- this is a movie with many important moral messages to impart about survival, commmunity, human dignity and resistance.

Daniel Craig gives a powerful performance as Tuvia Bielski, the group's leader -- all the more powerful for its understatement. Liev Schreiber is just as good as his brother Zus, who wants only to fight and kill to avenge the awful personal losses the family has endured.

If this were only a movie about men fighting a vastly superior force, it would be incredible enough. But Tuvia Bielski opened his camp to all survivors -- the old, the young, the sick, women, children. No-one was turned away. It's amazing to contemplate how they survived two bitter Russian winters with little or no food. Yet by the time of the liberation, they were running a school in the middle of the forest.

Incredibly, the brothers managed to save the lives of 1,200 people. Today, some 19,000 people are alive who would not have been were it not for their heroism.

There are many exciting battle scenes and tender love scenes and interesting secondary characters -- but the central metaphor comes when the band of refugees is forced to flee German armor and air power and find themselves wading through a massive swamp, holding on to each other's belts. It's an image that looks back to the exodus from Egypt -- although one of the brothers states that God will not save them this time and will not part the waters. Only by employing their own strength, determination and persistence will they survive.

In another painful scene, a German soldier is captured and then bludgeoned to death. Tuvia Bielski does not try to intervene. He understands that although he aspires to a higher moral standard, the cry for revenge among people who have been reduced by their enemies to animals, have been mistreated, humiliated and degraded and have seen their loved ones massacred cannot be appeased without blood. It is also an acknowledgment that to fight a monstrous force like Nazi Germany, a certain brutal ruthlessness is sometimes required.

The extra features on this DVD include interviews with family members of the Bielskis, who went on to build lives in the United States and some haunting photographs of survivors by director Edward Zwick.

3581372,4,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" captures the gritty and often ugly facts of guerrilla warfare in WWII's Eastern Front.  The fact that it was filmed in Lithuania doesn't matter, as only a few kilometers and an artificial barrier in a trackless forest separated similar partisan bands fighting the same enemy.  There is, I see, a tendency to do some backward projecting: that is, these Jewish refugees are acting too much like modern Israelis, rather than Diaspora Jews.  While it's true that some of the toughest Jewish commandos of the Israeli War of Independence cut their teeth in the forest wars of Europe, the film makes too direct a connection.  It's easy to forget that the majority of people in these communities were not ""tough Jews"" and did NOT fight back.  It was not in their history or culture to do so.  Resistance was offered by an exceptional few - like the Bielskis - young men with their bridges burned and nothing left to lose, including memories; while the majority around them clung to tradition to carry them through one more round of trouble.  But the film at least is honest enough to show why this majority, as portrayed by the ghetto elder, refused to ""act"" with doom staring them in the face.

Still one of the better examples of the Holocaust genre.",1255910400,,1255,4.724770642201835
3581373,4,B001FB55JO,"DEFIANCE is a war movie but it is also a movie of conscience.  From the time that the Germans overran Poland to start the Second World War, Hollywood tended to tell the big picture.  The hero was often a stern figure in the John Wayne mold or an eager kid like Audie Murphy.  Director Edward Zwick took a different route.  He read about the real life exploits of the Bielski brothers who led more than one thousand Poles and Belorussians out of the ghetto to hide in the forest and become partisans against the Germans.  What makes the tale especially telling is his presentation of Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), the leader of the partisans, as one who became leader only by default.  There was no one else to step up.  Tuvia's brother Zus (Liev Schrieber) fights Tuvia almost as often as he does the Germans.  Wartime forces men to show who they are and what they stand for, and when it comes time to killing the enemy, questions about the morality of doing so are quickly raised but almost as quickly postponed for a time when luxury permits hindsight.  Zus wants revenge for his slaughtered family.  Tuvia counters that revenge is mutually exclusive with survival.  Zus adds that only revenge will give them the moral strength to go on.  And so the dialogue goes.  This emphasis on morality is needed in films that so often lack it.  When the debating of morality dies down, the action part of the movie provides a non-verbal context that implies that both brothers are right, and rightness is a function that varies from man to man.

DEFIANCE presents the Bielskis as multi-dimensional figures who are faced with the impossible task of saving hundreds of Jews when doing so imperils their own lives.  This question of what is and is not possible arises again and  again.  When the Germans force the Bielski partisans to muck their way through a deadly swamp, one of the group cries out that to do so is impossible.  One of the Bielskis shouts that their very survival to that moment has been impossible.  Courage and hope are commodities that are often in short supply during the best of peaceful times.  DEFIANCE suggests that they may be found even in the hearts and minds of force fed heroes who doubt who they are but their followers insist that like Moses such leaders are chosen by God for a good reason.",1255824000,,2314,4.60880195599022

3581394,5,B001FB55JO,"I am absolutely astounded that this film was even made.  It is important not only for telling an amazing historical story, but it also gives a very good idea into the mindset of modern Jews, particularly of those in Israel today.  This film is certainly not ""politcally correct"" in showing Jews as fighters, as people wanting vengeance against their persecutors and in stubbornly remaining attached to their religious and national identity, in defiance of modern trends towards ""globalization"", cultural homogenization and anti-military and anti-nationalist ideologies in the United States and Western Europe.

Of course, the Holocaust is commemorated by everyone today, and the Nazi terror in Europe is well-documented, but the particularly Jewish experience in Eastern Europe is not well understood, suprisingly, even by Jews themselves, particularly in the United States.  Jews in Eastern Europe had a very rich intellectual and cultural life, but with the ever present antisemitism lurking in the background, effecting everyone's perception of things.  Jews had different ideological and social responses to this....some held on strongly to traditional religious attitudes, which were generally passive, preaching patience, others tried (not with very much success) to assimilate to the surrounding non-Jewish culture, others turned towards Communism and Socialism, thinking that would lead to a new society and yet others turned towards Zionism.  This film shows this...unlike most modern films involving Jews which portray them in stereotypical terms, either as Paul Newman (in the film Exodus) as blond, tough, irreligious fighters indistinguishable from other non-Jews, or as weak, passive figures as in the Disney Film ""Miracle at Midnight"" who turn into cringing figures as Nazis close in on them (in Denmark) but whom are saved at the last minute  by tough, brave Danish resistance fighters.  In ""Defiance"" we see an accurate cross-section of Eastern European Jews representing the different trends I outlined above, but all having a respect for Jewish tradition, and all willing to pitch in, either as fighters or in other roles vital to keeping their underground community alive. Another important fact pointed out was the mixed response their group, particularly Zush, received from the Red (Soviet) Partisans, whom are supposed according to Communist ideology to oppose antisemitism, yet manyh of whom still harbor antisemitic attitudes, such as the comments to Zush that ""Jews don't know how to drink or to fight"".  The Bielskis showed them that Jews could learn how to fight.
The Jews who came to Israel in the years after World War II had values, traditions (e.g. the wedding scene in the film which is beautifully juxtabposed with a partisan attack on a German patrol) and experiences like these seen in the film burned into their memories and so anyone who sees this film will have at least some understanding of the mentality of many of the people in the country. Sefardic Jews, who make up close to half the Jewish population of Israel, while most not having to go throught the Holocaust, do also have similar memories of persecution which also contributes to the country's mindset. Thus, questions that some ""progressive"" Jews and otheres in the United States have regarding Israel's defense and foreign policies or the fact that Israel has an established Orthodox Rabbinate which seems to contradict ""liberal, Western"" values can be understood by learning about the Jewish peoples history and experiences and this film can be a good start in the education process.",1251331200,,3588,5.358792184724689
3581395,4,B001FB55JO,"I went into this movie with no previous awareness of the ""true"" story. I hadn't read about the Belieski brothers, although I have read a lot of stories behind World War II. I will say up front, now that I have done the research post movie-viewing, that the movie doesn't match the true story that closely. That being said, my title rings true.

Taken out of the context of all the true details of the story, the movie is cohesive, tight, yet broad in scope. The storyline is simple; three brothers each react differently to the death of the other members of their family, and the deaths of their friends -- and how they ultimately survive the horror of being hunted by both Nazis and their own countrymen eager to turn them in for rewards from the Nazis. What they do to survive, what they do to help others survive, and how they differ is what gives the movie its depth.

I was overwhelmed by the acting of Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber. Both are tour-de-force acting chops by actors that are already good. And the young actor, Jamie Bell, shows great promise if he grows into his potential shown here. The supporting roles, mostly played by virtual unknowns, and the location filming in Lithuania make for a surprisingly valid movie experience.

While there are quibbles, and not a few anachronisms, overall I'd have no problem seeing this movie again and again.",1250553600,,1366,4.636363636363637

3581400,5,B001FB55JO,"Defiance is outstanding, totally moving. In biblical times, during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, forests of Russia, and now as the Israelis have proven for 60 years on the battlefield, Jews are excellent warriors. This is one of the few ever films that shows Jews as noble and heroes. With very few exceptions, Jews are presented by Hollywood as ugly and scum, culminating with Tom Cruise's anti-Semitic character in Tropic Thunder. He may sing and dance, but he's a repulsive, ugly human being. I therefore applaud the courage it took to make and release this film in face of a barrage of well financed effective Arab and Palestinian propoganda, and Obama proclaiming in Cairo that Islam has a ""tradition of tolerance"" when they practice terror against civilians. As shown in Defiance, the Jews must take care of their own people, which the outnumbered brave Israelis, having learned the lessons of history in Europe and the Arab countries, have been doing with honor. Bravo for Defiance!

I've now seen the film a second time after many months have gone by and I was still profoundly moved by the courage of the Jewish partisans who fought the Nazis in the forests of Europe (mostly untold in the annals of history because Hollywood would prefer Jews to always be portrayed as victims rather than the heroes they are). It's amazing to realize that while all of Poland fell to the Germans in 14 days and the French not much longer, the handful hundreds of Jewish fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto, Poland, barely armed, overwhelmed by superior heavily armed elite SS troops backed up by planes and tanks sent to liquidate them, fought inch by inch and resisted the Nazis for an incredible 42 days! Defiance is a testament to the quality of the Jewish warrior, as so well expressed now by Israel's IDF, one of the best armies in the world, yet produced by a country of only 6 million Jews, a country without any natural resources, unlike their oil rich Arab neighbors. Just astounding. As an American Christian Evangelist, one of millions who respects and admires Israel, I highly recommend this film as a war film, and as a deeply moving film about the triumph of the human spirit.",1249862400,,2176,4.787234042553192
3581401,4,B001FB55JO,"A very interesting film about the real life story of the four Bielski brothers, who after barely escaping the massacre of their family by the Germans in Belorussia during World War II, moved to the nearby forest and formed a Jewish militia. Soon many more refugees join in (including women, children and elderly people) and the group reached the low thousands. With some aid from the Soviets, they successfully survived the war and even fought back in a number of occasions the German attacks (though apparently they did not engage in combat in real life as much as it appears in the film, very wisely, given the disproportion of forces between the two sides). Daniel Craig is a perfect in the role of Tuvia Bielski, who as the elder of the brothers was the commander of the militias. Much of the humor in the movie comes in the contrast between the tough guy nature of the two elder Bielski brothers and the far more intellectual demeanor of the rest of the group, most of them urban professional types who for the first time in their life have to learn how to survive in the forest. Though the film is somewhat conventional in its narrative, it is nevertheless both fascinating and beguiling. The beautiful, haunting forest where they hid is another attraction to the movie (the film was shot in Lithuania, next door to Belorussia where the action took place). It is somewhat surprising this story was never brought to the screen in sixty something years (this probably have to do with the low profile that the Bielski brothers choose for themselves after the war as well as for the fact that their alliance with the Red Army made their saga somewhat politically uncomfortable during the Cold War).",1249689600,2,1700,4.7272727272727275

It's easy to overlook these minor annoyances because of the thought provoking look at this groups many obstacles and how the Germans weren't the only enemy to overcome.

Secondly, the two lead performances were excellent. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber, who played Jewish brothers (""Tuvia and Zus Bielski,"" respectively) with different outlooks on how to survive and/or fight the Nazis, were riveting. It reminded me of ""Munich,"" where you also hear two points of view on how to react to terrorists.

The story offered a good mix of action, drama and even some romantic touches. In addition to the two male leads, the women in here were interesting, too.

Although about two hours, 20 minutes in length, I was never bored. Only one short segment in the film - a battle scene with Nazis and a tank out in the middle of a forest - lacked credibility.

That is too bad because this movie is definitely worthy. The movie is based on the story of the three Bielski brothers (Tuvia, Zus, and Asael), and how they saved over a thousand Jews during World War II by hiding out in the forest. In the beginning, it is just a few of them, but over time, as they move around the forest and the war progresses, the number they take in grows until they have a whole village setup.

In addition, tensions heat up between Tuvia and Zus, leading Zus to leave with a few soldiers to join another group, made up of all fighters. Winter is cold and harsh, and with the lack of food, conflict erupts between those who find food and other members of the community.

This is also a story of what happens when chaos ensues, when everyday is a gift, not a given, where order and peace is precarious, and where pain and suffering are commonplace. Daniel Craig and Live Schrieber both gave stunning performances. Although I thought the beginning was slow, it was mainly because I had trouble figuring out who was who, where they were going and what everyone was doing.

3581421,4,B001FB55JO,"In one of the film's most powerful moments, the protagonist Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig) tells the group of rag-tag Holocaust survivors he's collected and is protecting that the very act of staying alive proves their humanity. Living in the woods and hiding from Germans, local police co-opted by the SS, and surviving by whatever means necessary, DEFIANCE drives home the point that survival, even when it's ugly, is a beautiful and compelling thing. But it is in that act of living that the varying shades of gray of both life and war are applied, and Defiance is pretty good at showing imperfections of its heroes right alongside their bravery. The movie is best when it is focused not on skirmishes between the Germans and the Bielski insurgents, but on the ways that people compromise to stay alive. The movie's depictions of forest life--including building shelters, cooking, huddling together in the extreme cold--are all powerful reminders of how easy most of our lives are, and of the steel that sometimes is found beneath human skin. The will to live is powerful, and when the movie portrays that it is fantastic.

Captivating, entertaining, complex, and largely well done, DEFIANCE has but a few flaws--there are things that just don't ring true in the movie (a battle with a German tank for example) but these are not distracting from the meat of the story. This is a very good film.

Tuvia (Daniel Craig), the eldest, becomes the reluctant leader.  Zus (Liev Schreiber) advocates violent retaliation against the Nazis.  The youngest, Asael (Jamie Bell), is caught in a rivalry between his two brothers.
 It is this conflict that gives the story its bite.  With so much at stake, two average men have been thrust into the roles of saviors and protectors.  There are definite parallels with the story of Exodus, particularly the wandering in the wilderness with no end in sight.
 Director Edward Zwick provides a gripping portrait of the difficult conditions and the logistics of hiding such a huge group of people from roaming German patrols.  There is ever-present tension and suspense, since conditions are so precarious, defense against the far better-equipped Nazis is uncertain, and weather conspires to take its toll on the innocent.

What happened to the brave Jews who fled the ghettos and small villages as the Nazis began their extermination campaign, how did they fare when they sought refuge in the forests? This film details how a band of three brothers survived on the run in the woods, then found themselves welcoming into their camp more and more refugees in need of their help and knowledge of survival techniques. Excellent performances by all concerned esp. Daniel Craig. I've been waiting for this story to be told on film for decades. The closest themed-film to it was a TV film from the mid-80's ""Sobibor"" starring Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer, about a concentration camp revolt where Jewish inmates and Russian POW's attacked their guards with stolen rifles and provided time for inmates and rebels to escape to the forests. Another book on this theme published in the 60's was ""Treblinka"" by Jean-Francois Steiner - although I must add here that the book is now considered controversial because survivors have protested the author's supposed fictional development of certain facts and persons.",1247011200,,1403,5.0257510729613735

3581430,3,B001FB55JO,"Based on a true magnificent story, Defiance takes place towards the beginning of WW II, just when the true Nazi terror was taking shape and the Jews were marked, killed and taken away to die. Four brothers, whose parents were killed by the Germans, take refuge in the forests of Belorussia and take with them dozens of other homeless jews, fighting to stay alive. There is internal conflict, as well as the one they must face everyday and truthfully, though moving at times, the film lacks something that would have made it great.

Daniel Craig plays the eldest brother, and leader of the pack and his accent and attempt at Russian is the most annoying of the film. In fact, his character is actually the weakest. Next in age,  Liev Schreiber plays a more convincing Russian Jew and is far more interesting.

Plot-wise, it is for the most part, dull while we watch them build shelters in the forest only to run away again when they are nearly found and hunted down. There is a couple of action scenes thrown in for good measure and love interests as well.

This could have been a heart-felt film, but it stopped short and feels sort of empty. Surely not 100% accurate, it still however manages to convey the sheer horror of that time in history and in that regard, it does not fail.

While I cannot determine what parts of the story are true, I can say that it is the type of story that makes me appreciate what went on during parts of history before my time.  I always appreciate good films about real people who were made heroes by their reactions to extremely hard times.  Daniel Craig is no sophisticated James Bond in this film.

I do not regret this purchase as it was a wonderfully gripping, moving film about an untold story from World War II. My husband has an interest in the era and enjoys Daniel Craig as Bond, so this movie seemed a natural choice as a gift. We watched it together and agreed it was a story that needs to be told and a movie that needs to be seen. The story follows the three Bielski brothers, Jews who choose to hide from the Nazis (in the forest of their homeland Belarus) rather than submit to being hauled off to death camps. As their ragged band grows, conflicts arise within the group as the two older brothers struggle over their own relationship as well as the role of leader and everyone deals with issues ranging from food, shelter, illness, love, and jealousy. The film is violent by necessity but not gratuitously so. It raises the question of how to fight evil without being evil, and it doesn't blink away from the difficulty and ambiguousness of such a heavy issue.

3581442,4,B001FB55JO,"The 2008 holiday season gave us two cinematic efforts detailing the true stories behind two separate acts of resistance to the Hitler regime, Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie"" and this.  Each is guaranteed to haunt you after it's over, and make you marvel afresh at the depths of both cruelty and courage of which human beings are capable.  I recommend watching them both as a double bill to see some of the most committed acting performances of recent times.

Powerhouse Daniel Craig cements his reputation here as the most versatile and passionate actor to ever fill 007's shoes.  Somewhere between the grueling shooting schedules for his two Bond films, he also found time for this even more grueling picture, spending three or four months on location in Lithuania, and speaking very credible Russian for at least half of the film.  He plays Tuvia, the eldest of the four Bielski brothers who flee to the vast forests of Belarus after their parents are brutally slain by Nazi collaborators.  At first intent only on their own survival, they become the reluctant protectors of a ragtag band of fellow Jewish refugees.  The leadership role falls naturally to Tuvia, who recognizes that his humanitarian duty to save fellow Jews outweighs personal interests.  After a daring visit to the Nazi-guarded ghetto, their number swells to 1200.  With Tuvia as their commander, and a sort of 20th-century Robin Hood, these ordinary citizens organize a forest community, learning woodsmanship and weaponry, and survival skills.  Next-eldest brother Zus (Liev Schrieber) is not content to remain in a defensive posture and joins the nearby Red Army battalion so he can kill Germans.  The tension between the vengeful Zus and the more pragmatic and pacifistic Tuvia is central to the narrative.  In contrast to the ""Valkyrie"" script, which essentially covers the events of one day, and can do so in minute detail, the story of ""Defiance"" spans more than three years that the ""Bielski Partisans"" lived in the forest.  This is too large a canvas for the filmmakers to do little more than broadly sketch what this forest existence must have been like and some of the personalities involved, but we do get a pretty vivid taste, throughout the seasons, of life spent in the wilderness and on the move, constantly afraid for the security of their camp.  Apart from everyone looking too clean (personal hygiene must have been nearly impossible, especially for the women), one gets a sense of authencity.  The one concession to movie artifice is probably Tuvia's rousing speech to the people from astride a white horse--very ""Braveheart/King Arthur""esque--but it's a stirring and wonderful speech as delivered by Craig.  Really, why is he messing about with James Bond?  Here he brings to life a TRUE action hero, and the results are stunning.

Liev Schreiber as Zus is also a revelation.  None of Mr. Schreiber's previous roles had disposed me to put him in the top drawer of American actors, but here he more than holds his own opposite Craig.  One thinks the ""Wolverine"" movie is hardly worthy of his talents based on his work here.  Jamie Bell and George MacKay as the two youngest brothers are less central to the story but also comport themselves well.  Director Edward Zwick (""Glory"") is fond of the big historical canvas; as in his earlier film, committed performances from the leads elevate what could have been just a dry and somber historical lesson into a deeply-felt personal statement.  And just like ""Glory"", ""Defiance"" adds a much-needed chapter of previously-overlooked acts of heroism in war to our collective consciousness.  Be sure to watch the bonus features for a touching photographic tribute to some of these brave unsung soldiers who defied evil until the very end.",1245628800,,3763,5.022544283413849
3581443,5,B001FB55JO,"What a film! This excellent documentary, based on the book of the same title by Dr Nechama Tec, reveals the story of the Bielski brothers and how they managed to save some 1200 Jews during the Holocaust while on the run and hiding in the forests of Poland. Many aspects of the hardships and dilemmas they faced are depicted, however briefly, and what I found most remarkable is that such a high ethic of community and compassion was able to exist in the midst of fear and death.

I was also astounded by the humility of these men that they did not share their story after the war and did not seek credit. What they wanted most of all was to save lives, and the story of how they managed that is well told.

The Bielski's story is a very important one in the spectrum of Holocaust experiences, but was not in the public eye and mind until this film filled that void. It is well done; the acting is excellent and the scripting managed to avoid ""kitsch.""",1245628800,2,951,4.337078651685394
3581444,5,B001FB55JO,"I liked it. If there is such a thing as old-style cinematography, Defiance is it. For me, Liev Schrieber's Zus was the stand out performance, and I thought he was a nice contrast to Daniel Craig's Tuvia. The two of them play off each other very well.

The story appeals to me because it's one I hadn't heard before. We usually hear about Jews as victims, and not so much about Jews fighting back during WWII.

I liked the film even better after watching the DVD extras, and hearing some of the stories about the brothers and their families. I can't imagine what it must have been like for them.",1245628800,,594,4.390909090909091
3581455,5,B001FB55JO,"Defiance tells the true story of the three eldest strong-willed and brave Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, and Asael, who lead a group of their fellow Jews through the forest in Eastern Europe during the dark days of Nazi occupation in World War Two. The movie truly is a work of art with excellent character development and plenty of action, suspense, and drama mixed with poignant moments. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography lacks nothing either. The acting is profoundly convincing and I must say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. The subject matter is such that of course it's not a family movie; there's quite a bit of violence and I do not recommend this for small children. On the other hand, when children are old enough to study the Holocaust this movie can be a very useful educational device, especially as this is all a true story.

The story begins in 1941 when the Bielski brothers lose their parents and most of their small village to Nazis who raid the town and kill the Jewish people almost for sport. We meet Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), his brother Zus (Liev Schreiber) and their very young brother Aron (George MacKay). How did these Jewish brothers survive the Nazi attack? Tuvia and Zus managed to quickly hide in the forest while Aron hid in the cellar. There's also another Bielski brother named Asael (Jamie Bell) and these four brothers clearly have the leadership skills it will take for them to survive at least for a little while in the forest not too far from their former village. However, things begin to change quite unexpectedly when other Jews join them in the forest. Eventually, more and more Jewish refugees join them in the forest until they numbered roughly twelve hundred people. There are love affairs that blossom and happier moments punctuated by fierce attacks on the road as the Bielski brothers kill Nazis to get their weapons and medicine and we witness two or three deadly Nazi attacks on the forest refugees as well.

There's another ongoing plot that is equally interesting. While Zus Bielski wants to join the Russian forces and fight with them, his brother Tuvia prefers to stay in the forest with the refugees and function as their leader. When the brothers finally come to blows over the matter it becomes clear that Zus will join the Russians and Tuvia will remain with the other Jews. Asael and Aron also remain with the Jews.

Look for particularly excellent performances by Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, Alexa Davalos as Lilka, the woman Tuvia marries, and Mia Wasikowska who plays Chaya Dziencielsky, the woman Asael marries. All the others give very strong performances as well; I truly felt like I was watching live action unfold right before my very eyes. This is all so well done and so powerful it almost felt more real than just a movie.

The DVD comes with interesting extras. I particularly liked ""Defiance: Return to the Forest;"" ""Children of The Otriad"" and ""Bielski Partisan Survivors."" There is also an optional commentary with director Edward Zwick.

Defiance will forever be one of the most powerful and moving films depicting the struggles of Jews just to stay alive during the horrors of the Holocaust. The acting is outstanding and the story of the Bielski brothers is true; I highly recommend this film.",1245542400,2,3323,4.82280701754386

3581457,3,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" tells the story of the three Bielski brothers in Belorussia during the Second World War.  The brothers are Jewish partisans who save the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Nazi occupation.  The story is little known and deserves to be told.  It is truly remarkable.

Despite the drama of the story, the film fails to deliver.  It seems to fall somewhere between a documentary and a war story.  In the case of the former, it seems light on detail and in the case of the latter it lacks punch.  This is a pity.  The story itself has so much potential.

The lead characters and brothers are played by Daniel Craig (yes, the current James Bond), Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell.  Each is praiseworthy in their roles and generally plausible.  The acting overall is solid and the settings very realistic.  I believe the filming was undertaken in Lithuania.

However, I am unable to strongly recommend the film.  It's a solid performer without at any stage rising to great heights.  See it, learn a little known historical vignette from World War II, but it will never survive as a great war film.",1245456000,2,1110,4.649484536082475

3581459,5,B001FB55JO,"Based on the true story of Partisan heroes the Bielski brothers, Defiance is set in very close proximity to the actual happenings in the forrests of Belarussia.  Daniel Craig playing Tuvia and Liev Schreiber playing Zus, two of three brothers who flee to the forrests close to their parents home after the Nazi forces start to kill off their Jewish friends and neighbors.

Tuvia and Zus are the two older brothers who have lost their whole families.  You get a sense of the struggle to stay alive and to fight both as a Jew and as part of the Red army.  Zus and Tuvia are struggling between themselves as to which way to go as the numbers of refugees fleeing to the forrests start to swell the numbers following the three brothers.  You will witness acts of sheer boldness, going into occuppied areas to help others flee sure destruction.  You get a sense of a needing to act from the brothers, who have acted from the beginning.

Part of the struggle is as to whether kill or hurt those still living a relatively normal life surrounded by war who supply those of the partisans with food.  You come to understand that everyone is asking these people for food, the Red Army, all the partisans and the German forces.  You need to read the two books to get more information on this, I will refer to them later.

The action scenes are very intense, from defending themselves to moving from a camp they occuppied for most of a year as the German forces attack.  The movie attempts to give us the sense that the brothers are heros.  And you get more of the sense of that when you learn about it in the extras.  They were apart of the Great Generation, but from another land who you find in the extras make something of themselves when they move West.

You wonder how so many could survive such difficult circumstances, lack of basics, harsh winters, worries about sudden attacks from an overwhelming force.

Two good books to review are ""Defiance, The Bielski Partisans"", which really gets to the core of the day to day lives of the Partisan bands and gives you a clear picture of where our true heros come from.  The other, ""The Bielski Brothers.""  The latter has a little review of the daily lives with some interesting tales of actions of the partisons.

This is a must see movie, although rated R mostly due to language, the actual war type content is with little gorey bloodshed.  I recommended it to my good friend who has three sons.  I think you will understand why when you see it.

I am torn as to whether to recommend seeing the extras first or the movie.  The extras in this DVD are a must.",1245283200,,2596,4.467091295116773

3581461,5,B001FB55JO,"I saw this film in my local movie theater and I picked it up as soon as it came out on blu-ray.  I loved it then and I still love it.  It is a true story of the holocaust that has almost never been heard before: three Russian brothers who created a community of Jewish survivors of the Nazi genocide deep in the forest, under constant threat of starvation, the elements and the Nazi invaders who had taken over their country.
This film is great on every level: script, direction, special effects, etc.  But it is the acting that is really a marvel:  Daniel Craig is simply outstanding as the oldest brother Tuvia.  I admire his performance as 007, however here he is simply fantastic.  How he did not warrant an academy award nomination as best actor is simply beyond me.  He is almost matched by Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell as the other two Bielski brothers.
This film does not depict the holocaust in such graphic terms as Schindlers List or War and Remembrance.  I think it can be watched and understood by younger viewers.  I would recommend it to young people who really do not know anything about the holocaust.
The picture and sound on the blu-ray are outstanding.  The special features include a nice retrospective on the making of the film and I especially enjoyed a short subject featuring current interviews with the children of the Bielski brothers, including numerous home movies.  This segment was excellent.
This film did okay business upon its opening late last holiday season.  It received mediocre reviews and received only one oscar nomination for best music.  The fact that it received so little interest from the jaded movie reviewers proved to me, without a shadow of a doubt, that the holocaust is no longer of major interest to the elitist movie critics.

I love War Movies, I love Daniel Craig--he was great in ""Munich"", and ""Casino Royale"", he is the biggest Star in the film and..he's the biggest diappointment. The story is good; Russian Jews banding together to suvive/fight the Germans in the forest behind enemy lines, with Craig, Liev Schriber, and Jamie Bell being the 3 Brothers leading the refugees. The problem is the movie starts off with no back story; it's just Daniel Craig being thrust into the role of Leadership and on it goes and in the end it never really 'goes' anywhere. Craig is sometimes stong; sometimes confused; sometimes he just 'checks out' as the leader cause its 'so hard'. His modern man, 'stressed out, conflicted guy' just doesnt fit a character in a 1942 WWII film, it seems totally out of place. Schriber is ok but not developed much as a chracter and Jamie Bell seems miscast as the youngest Brother. The action sequences are okay till Liv somehow comes out of an intense gun battle with machine guns with just his arm in a sling. In the end the story just doesn't amount to much which is too bad because the movie is based on real events and those events were truly heroic.",1244851200,17,1184,4.563380281690141
3581466,3,B001FB55JO,"I've noticed that a number of the other reviews of this picture have actually been more of a debate as to whether the Bielski brothers at the core have been accurately represented from an historical perspective rather than an examination of the film.  Now, let me start this off by saying that I knew nothing of the true-life story upon which this is based; so I am not prepared to comment on how the film translates the actual story to the screen or whether those aspects of the story are accurate to history with respect to the brothers.  My look at this is strictly at the picture as a piece of film making and on that front, I thought it was an average film which was surprisingly week on emotional impact.  That surprised me given the central story which should have been an emotionally powerful one.

The are a number of things that keep Defiance from having any kind of lasting impact on me as a viewer.  First and foremost is the script which not only tends to be repetitive, but also fails to establish the brothers at the beginning of the picture.  We have no idea who these men are from a personality standpoint before we are launched into the crux of the conflict, both from a narrative standpoint and a sibling conflict.  Also, the dialog is not particularly well crafted and there are moments when the screenwriters attempted to interject some humor.  Unfortunately, because the relationships are not clear, the humor comes of banal and grossly out of place. The attempts at humor come off as attempts at lame one-liners.

The other major problem with the script is that it never seemed to decide what it wanted to be.  If this a story of survival at all costs?  Perhaps.  But then we're off into the basic conflict between the two brothers.  And then it seems to want to become a love story with no less than three of the lead men giving long hard stares at women. And then it becomes an action piece. The problem is, it never focuses on any one of these things long enough to grab the viewer.  Don't get me wrong, movies can be complex, but the shift from one focus to the other are jarring and that, at a core level, this is the responsibility of the screenwriter, or at the very least the director who should be able to smooth things out.

Casting wise, the choices were fine, though Daniel Craig does seem horribly out of place and mis-cast.  Each turns in decent performance, but none of them have any emotional depth.  So even though Shreiber (an actor I don't usually care for) is actually very good and Billy Elliot's Jaime Bell is very good, the script and direction abandon them.  We never get the chance to invest in any of them before we're focusing on one of the others.

The remaining cast are competent, but they are saddled with flat, un-dynamic characters and some out-and-out stereotypes. Without a script to support them, each of the supporting actors are reduced to unimpressive stock players.

Oh, and the pace of this film can be dreadfully slow at times, again due to lack of any interesting nuances in the script.

In the end, this should have been a powerful and moving film, but it wasn't.  It was certainly acceptable but it never rises above average and, sadly, forgettable despite the real-life story behind it.",1244851200,32,3255,4.566265060240964

The holocaust Jews are stereotyped now, as in Schlinder's List on, with the same dreary appearance -- the rabbi, the teacher, the intellectual, and the women who only want to grab a guy. We saw very few Germans, and they appeared to be bit players. The scenery in Lithuania was beautiful with nice location shots. The casting was OK, but predictable. Jews should look like Talmud scholars or freedom fighters.
In using Craig in the film, it destroyed authenticity. Hollywood is so afraid the film won't make money, they had to use a name star.

At least the Russians were believable: they spoke Russian, not Oxford English. They even looked like high class Russians. Hollywood could have used Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, but that would have totally ruined the movie. I give it 3 stars because the events, and the ending, were predictable.

Any film based (however loosely)on true events and real people will run into challenges and Defiance is no different. It would not be surprising to learn that the real Bielskis were not quite as noble and altruistic as they come to be portrayed here; but that is not really the point of a 2 hour movie.

I particulalry enjoyed the scenes of day to day living in the forest. Craig and the rest of the cast were convincing. Craig's character, Tuvia was often faced with extremely hard choices/moral dilemmas and his reactions were credible, as was his indecision in the marshes when the young brother steps into the breech in his stead. And generally, if you had not read their story the narrative was tense.

One beef I had was the fact that the most nervous member of the group was always on guard duty at camp!  For that task, you'd place your most trusted guys, not the most skittish. Also, there would have been other safety rules-eliminating wood smoke by day, particulalry when Germans were expected nearby, keeping noise down etc. At times the camp seemed a bit to free and loose, given the potential for discovery.

3581474,4,B001FB55JO,"This motto serves to sum the feelings of the Bielski brothers as they escape the horrors of the Nazi extermination of Jews in 1941.  Adapted from Dr. Nechama Tec's book DEFIANCE: THE BIELSKI PARTISANS by director Edward Zwick and Clayton Frohman this film is as much about family devotion as it is about extended family.  It is a touching story of survival under the most impossible conditions and a story of heroism that is far too unknown among even scholars of the WW II period.

Set in 1941 DEFIANCE introduces four brothers of the Bielski family (the parents have been victims of the Nazi Final Solution in Belorussia) - the compassionate brother  Tuvia (Daniel Craig),  angry and reactive brother Zus (Liev Schreiber), and the younger brothers Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George McKay).  In response to the war the brothers find refuge in the forest where gradually they encounter other Jews hiding from the Nazis and through thoughtful and clever means form an ever enlarging community  where their extended family is fed and cared for and prepared with weapons stolen from the Nazis to defend their existence and protect them from being placed in the death camps.  The film is a series of encounters with the enemy but it is also a very touching collection of stories of survival in the wilderness by such concepts as allowing men to have 'forest wives', pitting the religious teachings of a professor Haretz (Allan Corduner) and the pure intellectualism of  writer Isaac Malbin (Mark Feurstein), and other interludes of interpersonal coping with tragedy.

The cast is a fine one with Liev Schreiber the most convincing, but with a fine new role type for Daniel Craig. There is an odd mixture of accents from each of the actors - each trying to imitate the Russian sound.  But in the end the viewer is left with a sense of respect and even awe at the courage and discipline of outcasts surviving a hideous nightmare, simply by staying alive.

3581485,5,B001FB55JO,"This is a true story of Jewish resistence to the holocaust. Three Jewish peasants escape to the surrounding forest after they return to the family home after a day at work to find everyone massacred. As they begin to build a camp they discover others who have also fled into the forest, fleeing the Nazi murderers. The reluctantly collect their fellow survivors and transform them into an effective band of partisan fighters, even leading people out of the ghettos where they face certain death. ""If we die, at least we will die free"" is their motto. It one point, when at seems that death is upon them, the youngest brother encourages the group by reminding them that they have already done the impossible and that they will go on and triumph by their own will and unanimity. And they do- living in the forest for two more years and managing to have a makeshift school, hospital, and nursery-all in the midst of the most appalling adversity.
The special features on the disc are terrific, including interviews with the descendants of the brothers and stories of 19,000 people who survived or were born to the survivors led by these three brothers.
The youngest brother was killed fighting on the Russian front after leaving the forest but the other two Bielski brothers eventually got to the United States where they became part of the American dream that has been the miracle for so many from so many countries.

3581487,4,B001FB55JO,"Even as a compulsive reader about all things to do with the Holocaust, I had never really paid too much attention to the story of the Bielski brothers, focusing instead on the more famous instance of Jewish resistance against the Nazis, i.e. the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising [of which there was a made-for-TV feature titled ""Uprising"" starring Hank Azaria, David Schwimmer and Lee Lee Sobieski - a credibly portrayed feature actually]. Anyway, when I read that a movie was to be made about the Bielski brothers, my interest was piqued.

Based on the book ""Defiance: The Bielski Partisans"" by Nechama Tec, the movie recounts the story of three Jewish brothers, i.e. Tuvia [Daniel Craig], Zus [Liev Schreiber], and teenager Asael [Jamie Bell] who seek shelter in the deep forests of Belorussia in 1941 when the Germans invade. Starting out as a small band of refugees, the group eventually grows, with Tuvia assuming leadership, much to the resentment of hot-headed brother Zus who feels they should not be accommodating more Jews at a time when their own resources are strained. The love-hate relationship between the two brothers [with kid brother Asael trying hard to mediate] is a focal point of the story, as much as the story of how hundreds of Jews eventually make their home in the forest, organizing themselves into a community with a group of fighters, food gatherers and the common folk.

With the restricted time frame, the story tends to get choppy at times, with a lot of side story arcs that never get fully explored, but the action is kept going at a steady pace - Jews fleeing the Nazis, the Bielski brothers raiding a German holding to get medicine, the Red Army fighting alongside some Bielski partisans against the Germans, even a marriage!

I felt the writing could have been better and wished they'd touched more on the social hierarchy within the forest camp and the apparent stratification between the various groups. But, the credible acting by the leads, especially Daniel Craig's Tuvia [the calmer, more rational brother] and Liev Schreiber's Zus [the impulsive and angry revolutionary] more than made up for the other deficiencies in the plot. With a story as complicated as the Bielski brothers [reading historical accounts about them, one learns that there were many underlying tensions in the forest camp], its understandably difficult to tell the full story within the time constraints.

On the whole though, I did enjoy the movie - it is rather unique in that it tells the story of one of the rare instances where the Jews actually fought back against the Nazis, and by some great miracle managed to survive by the hundreds. The other great instance of such resistance was the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis which didn't end as successfully as the Bielski story, but in a sense was truly inspiring for the courage of those Jewish fighters who died as martyrs [I'd recommend watching ""Uprising"" as a credible feature film portraying the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]. I'd recommend this movie to all those who are interested in the Holocaust, WW II, and especially about Jewish resistance during WW II [ and ""The Bielski Brothers"" a History Channel documentary would be a good complement to this, to fill in the gaps].",1244073600,,3246,4.93956043956044

3581489,3,B001FB55JO,"From Glory director Edward Zwick comes Defiance, an account of some not as well-known as they should be heroics by the Bielski brothers during World War II.  Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell star as the heroic Jewish brothers, who seek to withstand the Nazi onslaught in the forests, and join up with Russian resistance fighters as well.  Where Defiance works is by and far with its trio of main actors; all of whom are wonderfully compelling in their roles.  The rest of the film however doesn't always quite manage to hold up to its stars though, as it beings to plod itself down and just get too wrapped up in itself throughout its middle section.  Not to mention a number of historical inaccuracies (Nechama Tec's book from which the film is based is definitely a more worthwhile endeavor) and some accents which are all over the place, and Defiance ends up being a fairly good, but nothing great, historical pic.  It's definitely nice to see the story of the Bielski brothers make it to the limelight courtesy of Zwick, but in the end, the director and the story itself are definitely suited for a better film.  That being said, Defiance isn't bad in the least, and it is definitely compelling enough to warrant viewing for history buffs and war film lovers.",1243900800,2,1275,4.695067264573991
3581490,2,B001FB55JO,"Life under totalitarian regimes is an area of informal study for me. I mean study, when I come across a movie or book I like to go to cited sources and dig deeper. This book interested me initially because of the movie. The book, however is a major let-down.

It seemed as if the author did not pursue individual interviews with the Bielki's with enough alacrity and resorted to repetition of facts and anecdotes 3 and 4 times, sometimes within same two or three pages. I wanted to know more about what motivated and drove these simple men to decide to be free.  Enough already I wanted to say! The time line is distorted also. It's as if the narrative ""became unstuck in time"" as Vonnegut says in Slaughterhouse 5. Back and forth we go. I got dizzy.

After this I read Vengeance. Talk about a difference! Succinct story telling and a timeline that moves almost on schedule but keeps your interest.

The Defiance story in and of itself is fascinating and inspiring. I applaud the brothers who seemed to be getting hit from all sides and only wanted to live their lives in peace. Who among us would take up arms and ""Live Free or Die?"" It's a question we must all ask ourselves especially these days with the apparent revival of ""statism"" and it's promises and threats.

Read it for historical interest but be prepared to dig for the good stuff but slug through repetitious writing and an over-emphasis on the brothers relative sexual prowess and conquests.",1243814400,5,1456,4.6061776061776065
3581491,4,B001FB55JO,"In 2008, director Edward Zwick (""I Am Sam"", ""Blood Diamond"", ""My So-Called Life"") and screenwriter Clayton Frohman adapted Holocaust scholar, Nechama Tec's book ""Defiance: The Bielski Partisans"".  The film would feature music by well known composer and orchestrator James Newton Howard (""ER"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Pretty Woman"" and ""The Sixth Sense"") and cinematography by Eduardo Serra (""Blood Diamond"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""What Dreams May Come"").

The film would star Daniel Craig ( ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Casino Royale"" and ""Layer Cake""), Liev Schreiber (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""The Sum of All Fears"" and ""A Walk on the Moon""), Jamie Bell (""Jumper"", ""Flags of Our Fathers"", ""King Kong"") and Alexa Davalos (""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""The Mist"" and ""Angel"").

""DEFIANCE"" is a film which takes place during the Nazi occupation through Eastern Europe and Jews were targeted and murdered.  The film is based on a true story that revolves around the Bielski brothers who helped give refuge to around 1,200 Jews and help them evade the Germans while being hunted.  The brothers and the Jews which started with only a handful of people grew to over a thousand while they stayed in the Forest under harsh conditions (while being hunted) with their primary goal was to survive.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""DEFIANCE"" features awesome picture quality.  The closeups on Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber show the pores and the grit while in the forest.  Because the film was shot during the seasons, outdoor sunshine shots are vibrant in colors with the blue skies, green lush vegetation, while in the Winter, we are treated with blues and whites of despair.  You will see plenty of detail due to the 1080p (1:78:1 aspect ratio) transfer in the film, may it be the trees, the vehicles and even the clothing and the people, ""DEFIANCE"" featured one of the best picture quality war films I have seen on Blu-ray yet.

As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (as well as French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The soundtrack features impressive action scenes as bombs utilize the low frequency sounds of the booms through the subwoofer, while gunshots galore are well delivered through the front channels.  You also hear the ambiance of the forest which include the rustle of leaves, storms, birds and subtle noises around the area which can be heard quite nicely through your speakers.

Overall, there was really good delivery of audio but I didn't notice a lot of rear surround usage for the film.  The film does feature crystal clear dialogue and the music of James Newton Howard does come alive in showing the desperation felt by those in the forest camp.  A lot of the action sequences do happen in the final 30 minutes of the film but overall, the soundtrack was well done.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""DEFIANCE"" is definitely a powerful  film and although based on a true story, the story of the Bielski brothers will now be known by a generation not too familiar with how this family of brothers helped give refuge to up to 1,200 (or more) Jews from the Holocaust.  Even afterwards, the brothers never looked at themselves as heroes and kept themselves low key throughout their lifetime.

If I had one major problem with the film is similar to other war or period films based on a true story, is the need to stray away from factual events in order to create action.  Granted, for me it depends on the level of exaggeration and how far it strays from factual events.  I understand why the Hollywood execs want to add the action sequences, because war battles lead to ticket sales.

A film like ""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" had to go that direction and historians were critical for its Hollywood dramatization and the same with ""DEFIANCE"".  According to reports, the original author of the book Nechama Lec was not too thrilled that in the film, the Bielski Partisans had to fight against German tanks, when the goal was to survive and not have head on confrontations.  Polish historians were upset that the film was oversimplified and the facts that the forest were the Jewish were hiding in was in Poland and of course, anger that Bielski Partisans were not heroes but thieves who stole and badly treated Polish locals.  But anger more so about the slaughters of Polish locals in the village of Naliboki which evidence has supported the murders were led by Russian partisans which many nationalists in Poland believe the Bielski's were involved (former members of Bielski's brigade and other historians have disputed this).

The director of the film, Ed Zwick has admitted that his film is not a simple fight between good and evil.  In a statement, Zwick said ""The Bielski's weren't saints.  ""They were flawed heroes, which is what makes them so real and so fascinating. They faced any number of difficult moral dilemmas that the movie seeks to dramatize: Does one have to become a monster to fight monsters? Does one have to sacrifice his humanity to save humanity?""

But the truth is that there are still many emotions that will continue no matter how many years have passed and when it comes to films in which war and crimes committed during war time, there will be some people who will think such things are justified, some who will think the opposite.  There will always be people on both sides who will continue to disagree.

I can understand why the studios wanted to make certain deviations from the book to the film's final cut. Especially for a film that costs $32 million to make, people come to the box office for these action sequence and fortunately the film was able to make its money back worldwide as it made over $44 million.

For me, what I found powerful was how these brothers provided a refuge and eventually rescued 1,200 Jews and how they had to live out challenges in the Forest under the worst conditions but their will to survive kept them going, even though they were being hunted down by the Germans.  There are so many war stories from the past in all parts of the world that people would have never known about and for ""DEFIANCE"" to get the green light to be created and in the end, to come out so fascinating and again, so powerful, I was captivated by the willingness of those who wanted to live and survive, but if they died, they died because they wanted to live and for a purpose, not to be treated like an animal.

""DEFIANCE"" is one of those films that captures the persistence of the human spirit and it may have been overly simplified to be a film about surviving in the forest but it's the leadership that Daniel Craig brings to his character of Tuvia and Schreiber's Gung-Ho fight mentality for his character of Zus that makes the film quite interesting.  Unfortunately, the two go separate ways and the conflict between the two brothers  starts to bring more focus on the camp, while the character of Zus gets the short end of the stick and is rarely utilized throughout the film.

But the film does have its flaws but personally, I found ""DEFIANCE"" absolutely enjoyable and the Blu-ray release of ""DEFIANCE"" does feature awesome picture quality, as well as audio quality plus enjoyable special features.

Overall, ""DEFIANCE"" is highly recommended!",1243468800,9,9012,4.900461437046803
3581492,4,B001FB55JO,"After seeing this movie I was encouraged to read the book the movie is based upon authored by Nechama Tec as well as a book titled ""Stalin's Guerrillas"" written Kenneth Slepyan.  The movie does a decent job dramatizing the salient point that the heroic, defiant act of the Bielski partisans was not in killing Germans but in the saving over 1200 Jewish lives.  Of course the movie characters are an abstraction of many real-life individuals and the events portrayed are a generalization of typical experiences that occured.  The only highly fictional events are the end-movie action sequence involving a pitched battle and an attack on a German communications station to retrieve medicine.  Some interesting facts for the curious:
- The Bielski brothers were a minority amongst Jews in Belorussia being simple, mostly uneducated peasant farmers and millers.  Most Jews were craftsmen who dwelled in the city.  Thus the brothers were particularly suited to surviving in the forests.
- Often Jews often tried to escape the ghetos but were either caught by the Germans, denouced by Belorussian or Polish neighbors, or murdered in the forest by Russian partisans, which were particulary anti-Semetic
- In reality food was distributed based on your value - fighters first, crafts people second, and then scraps for everybody else
- In reality the women did not fight. There were simply not enough guns to go around.
- The Bielski patisans did attack and kill Belorussians that denounced Jews and did help regular Russian partisans ambush Germans convoys and isolated outpost; however their primary mission was always saving Jews
- The Bielski crafts people provided finished goods to other Partisan bands for food, thus keeping them in their good graces
- All partisans routinely slaughtered prisoners. It was a necessary because there was no way to keep them.  Plus revenge.
- Tuvia did in reality shoot several Jews who challenged his authority and threatened the overall survival of the group",1243382400,2,1990,5.142414860681114
3581493,5,B001FB55JO,"I thought this movie was extremely well done.  Daniel Craig and the entire cast did an exceptional job.  They may not have shown all of the violence of which the Bielski brothers are accused, but they did at least illustrate some of the negative.  This is the best Holocaust movie I have seen in a long time.  I was very impressed when the youngest brother came across a veritable ""river"" of dead, naked bodies in the woods.  At first I did not know what I was looking at because they had blurred the bodies out (I saw this in the movie theater, perhaps the DVD won't do this).  All I saw was a river of pink and then it dawned on me what I was seeing.  It was very tastefully done.  There was no NEED to show the bodies.  The audience KNEW what they were supposed to be seeing.  I am looking forward to owning the DVD as soon as it is released.",1243296000,,845,4.128834355828221

3581495,4,B001FB55JO,"World War II.  Germans are slaughtering Jews by the thousands.  It's a virtual hunt for the quarry, where those who don't overtly display themselves as Jewish are the game.  The Bielski brothers, a rugged trio of pseudo paramilitary farm-boys, take refuge in the wilderness where they attract a vast and ever-growing following of starving, desperate people escaping extermination.

Soon enough the Bielski clan grows to over 1200, and along with their growing ranks comes a need to feed and support the group, not to mention actively fighting the Germans who would desire their death.  The brutality of war, and in particular the horrendously inhumane manner in which the Nazis treated the Jews, is explored, but the essence of the story falls within the anxiety and rejection of reason cemented deep within the existential aspects of survival.  With each daring raid for food and supplies, the philosophical clash of individuals on the brink of death causes tension within the group that grows to rival that of the enemy, as well as the local rogue Russian armies.  Eventually the Germans get wind of trouble in the forests, which causes the cat-and-mouse game of survival of the Bielski brothers and their fellow ensconced runaways.

The power of Defiance is within the ability to entice the viewer to challenge and question the decisions involved in the flight or fight instincts faced by the Jewish during WWII.  Much like the rebellious group from Red Dawn - with an obviously more significant historical perspective - the elements of strategy, discipline, and solidarity against the enemy are present.  Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber deliver great performances as two main protagonists, Tuvia and Zus, but Jamie Bell steals the show as brother Asael Bielski.

A truly compelling tale of non-glamorized primitive survival that is sure to touch a nerve, this is a somewhat hidden gem; and despite slow moments and weak romantic story arcs, it's a superb addition to the military history genre.",1238889600,5,1998,5.116923076923077
3581496,3,B001FB55JO,"Judging from director Edward Zwick's great track record of fine films like ""Glory"", ""The Siege"", ""Blood Diamond"" and ""The Last Samurai"", I expected to really like this film.  Also the subject matter of Bielski brothers standing up to the Nazi would eliminate the myth that all Jews were passive to the Nazi's atrocities toward them. Alas I found myself looking to my watch to see when it would end which I don't usually do unless it's a Spike Lee movie!!  Granted the performances by Craig and Shreiber are excellent as the brothers but too many subplots deterred my interest or attention on the main theme.  Nevertheless, this film could warrant a rental but I doubt seriously I could put it up to other films dealing with the Holocaust such as ""Schindler's List"",""The Reader"" with an Oscar winning performance by Kate Winslet or ""The Pianist"".  Good try but falls a little short.",1238716800,9,881,4.814569536423841

3581498,4,B001FB55JO,"**This review contains spoilers**

By necessity, one must focus on the survivors if one wishes to create a workable film about the Holocaust. For its only through the eyes and ears of the survivors (and their tales of suffering) that we can appreciate the enormity, the scope of what occurred to the victims of the Holocaust. Paradoxically, the tales of the survivors are nothing more than anomalies--which may give the wrong impression to the uninformed that the Holocaust was an ennobling event--that these tales of survival were somehow the rule rather than the exception.

Defiance is one such anomalous tale. Some critics have likened it to a critique of Jewish passivity--that the overwhelming majority of Jews went to their deaths without putting up a fight. And certainly that reputation is reinforced in 'Defiance' as the protagonists, Tuvia and Zus Bielski, stand out as Jewish outsiders who aren't afraid to fight the Nazis as opposed to the majority of the Jewish 'intellectuals', mostly freshly minted refugees from the ghetto, who end up as part of the Bielski 'community' within the Byelorussian forest.

But there is an excellent scene in Defiance, where Tuvia sneaks into the ghetto and confronts the head of the Jewish committee there, that demonstrates that the average Jew was not passive--simply bewildered and overwhelmed. Can you really blame the head of the Jewish committee when he doesn't believe Tuvia's tales of genocide? He says, 'yes, we've heard these stories, but who can really believe them?' Reports of atrocities reached the United States during the War but they were not really appreciated until the actual newsreel photos of truckloads of emaciated bodies were seen being bulldozed into ditches at Bergen-Belsen after the war was over.

The opening scenes of 'Defiance' are testament to the brutally swift nature of the Nazi genocide. In most cases, there was simply no time to think about resisting (or escaping). The Nazis came in, along with the help of the local authorities in the occupied territories and murdered the Jews in the blink of an eye. We see this very effectively illustrated in 'Defiance' after the Bielskis find their parents murdered on the family farm.

One of the picture's strengths is that it also illustrates the role of the local collaborators who assisted the Nazis. In a dazzlingly effective scene, Tuvia takes revenge by shooting the local police chief and his sons after they've murdered his parents. The collaborators aren't seen as monsters--quite the contrary, in a humanized portrait, the police chief begs for his life and insists he was forced to act at the bidding of his superiors in the Nazi occupation force (in an earlier scene, the police chief comes to a farm looking for one of the Bielski brothers who hides in a barn after attacking a group of Nazis--here the police chief is much more crass and arrogant--but still all too human!).

Nonetheless, Zwick, the film's director, should have had another scene involving the collaborators to balance out the 'sympathetic' portrait. The truth of the matter was that there were other of these local collaborators who were outright sadists, capable of incomprehensible, monstrous acts of brutality. Similarly, Zwick shows us a group of Jews in the forest who end up savagely beating a captured German soldier to death (despite his cries that he has a wife and children). While such acts of revenge did occur, it's hard to appreciate the context for their actions (it would have been better if Zwick had actually shown the Bielski parents, for example, being murdered and not merely the aftermath).

A good deal of 'Defiance' explores the conflict between the two brothers. Tuvia is the pragmatic one who comes to accept his role as a new 'Moses', leading his beleaguered group of 'intellectuals' to safety through the forest. At first he has only contempt for his fellow Jews who he regards as cowardly and passive. But as time passes, they earn his respect as they all become more proactive. Zus, on the other hand, wants to take direct action against the Nazis and joins the Soviet partisans as one of their fighters. I thought that the characterization of the Russians was one of the strongest parts of the movies. They are depicted sympathetically--shown both for their courage and brutality (Zus eventually leaves the partisans after he can no longer tolerate their anti-semitic stance).

A good part of 'Defiance' is taken up showing life in the forest camp. The characterizations are a mixed bag. Some of the characters are standard 'types' (the debate between the 'intellectual' vs. the 'spiritual' Jew is one such example). There are some good scenes depicting the malnourishment that the community had to endure along with a few obligatory romances. One scene I had a hard time believing was when Tuvia kills one of the food hunters who insists that his group gets extra portions of rations. Did that really happen? I'm not sure but it made for good drama.

I like Daniel Craig in this role a lot more than as James Bond; he gives a solid performance as an unlikely savior for his people. And Lev Schreiber is excellent as the tough as nails partisan who eventually reunites with his brother after a fractured relationship.

Defiance's final scene focuses on the community battling and defeating a large group of Nazi soldiers backed up by a tank. I'm told that this is what actually happened but the way the whole thing is staged seemed a little hard to believe. Nonetheless, Defiance is a film that will keep you absorbed from the opening credits. As a little known history lesson, it does its job. And certainly it was a worthy project to commemorate the deeds of the heroic Bielski brothers.",1236988800,137,5730,4.965589155370178
3581499,4,B001FB55JO,"After only seeing the trailers, and thinking the movie looked interesting, I decided to give it a shot.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but after the film started I was very impressed.  I won't be commenting on the authenticity of this film, or how well it relates to the actual events that took place, instead on the content featured, parts played, etc.

First off like always, Daniel Craig is razor sharp!  From the first time he hits the screen to the end credits hes got you.  He does such a good job despite the circumstances he and his brother are facing.  He immediately takes the ""leader"" position and keeps his wits about him, even though they are being ""hunted"" through the Belarussian Forest.  Liev Schreiber also does an excellent job as Craig's brother, Zus Bielski.

The fact that something like this happened, and that the Germans could have done the things they did, provides the shock factor for this movie.  The entire theater sat perfectly quiet throughout the movie, with the exception of people perking up in their seats when the Bielski Brothers got a bit of revenge.

The point from which this movie was shot is a nice change from the concentration camps and German view we've seen in other movies.  The way these people dig in, band together (with the exception of a few outcasts) and survive is amazing, and makes for a really touching movie (historically accurate or not) Some scenes are a bit depressing, and some even have that tense feeling of ""what the heck are they gonna do"".

All the characters are very believable, and I think they do a great job of helping you get to know them.  At the same time this makes certain scenes heartbreaking...which to me makes a movie even more memorable!

I don't wanna ruin anything from the actual movie so Ill just end with saying, if you enjoy movies, being entertained, and taking a look at the way things once were from people who lived it CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT!  I will definitely be adding this one to my Blu Ray collection, and cant wait to watch it again!",1235952000,4,2029,4.581717451523546
3581500,5,B001FB55JO,"One wonders why it took so long to tell the story of the three Bielski brothers, who managed to save the lives of 1200 Jews during the Nazi Holocaust in World War II. My personal answer is that they didn't have anyone near the caliber of Daniel Craig to play the part of Tuvia.

The story opens with the Bielski brothers Tuvia (Craig) and Zus (Liev Schreiber) returning to the family farm to discover the Germans killed their parents.  They find their younger brother, Asael (Jamie Bell) hiding from the slaughter in a cellar.

They decide to go to the forest to hide out. It's initially pure happenstance that they run into other refugees, but as the story progresses, they have a community from philosophers to warriors.

It's fascinating to see the community grow and the harsh realities of living under the Nazi radar.  The images in this film will haunt me as strongly as the original newsreel ""Let my People Go"" did when I saw it in junior high.

In my opinion, ""Defiance"" is one of the top films of this year and I hope it earns the awards it deserves.  The film is excellent for students of Jewish history, psychology, and community development.  It's well worth full price in the theatre and adding to your collection.

3581501,3,B001FB55JO,"It's very easy to assume that Defiance is a wish-fulfillment revenge narrative wherein we finally witness stories of common folks who resisted the Nazis with tooth and nail.  A certain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/entertainment-magazine/dp/B001POAAPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">entertainment magazine</a>&nbsp;reviewer blithely dismissed the entire film as too ""Hollywood,"" because Tuvia (Daniel Craig) murders the entire family who assisted in the Nazis in wiping out his family. The review's assessment couldn't be further from the truth.

Defiance is the true story of Tuvia and Zus Bielski (Liev Schrieber), two brothers who lived on the fringes of polite Jewish society by surviving in the deep woods, more akin to bandits than heroes.  Where Tuvia is cool-headed, Zus is dangerously violent.  The two soon discover a widening circle of friends and distant relatives seeking their protection, until Tuvia is moved to rescue Jews from a ghetto.  Now he has to contend with well-bred city folks who know nothing about surviving in the Russian winter.

Defiance never glamorizes death.  The Nazi attacks share less screen time, presumably because audiences need no convincing about the nature of their crimes.  But even the Bielski retaliation against German troops is miserable -- Germans plead for their lives even as they are executed.  War, Defiance tells us, is reprehensible, and it is a task for rough men. The question is if rough men are responsible for protecting the weak. Why should soldiers protect civilians?

Every ugly part of war is on full display here: defections, in-fighting, disease, starvation, alliances of convenience (between men and women, Russians and Jews), bigotry, incompetence, loss of faith, and yes, brutal, bloody revenge.  By the end of the film, audiences are less likely to feel vindicated as they are disgusted by the places Defiance takes us. This is not a feel good film, not even as a revenge fantasy.

Defiance doesn't cover every angle.  As criminals themselves, the Bielskis surely committed crimes we don't see on screen (see the Wikipedia entry on the Bielski partisans for more). But it is hardly a glamorized portrayal of their experience.",1234828800,3,2236,5.579881656804734
3581502,3,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" is a 2008-2009 drama/war film starring Daniel Craig, the latest James Bond.

This is a true story: As Nazi forces sweep through Eastern Europe in 1941 the Bielski brothers seek refuge in the deep forests. More and more Polish Jews join their ranks for common protection and to oppose the occupying Germans. How can they all survive in the woods during the next four years of war?

""Defiance"" has a lot going for it: a story based on actual events, good actors, locations (filmed in Lithuania, a mere 100 miles or so from the actual sites), cinematography and score. Unfortunately it never rises above decent. I personally love survival-type films and ""Defiance"" pretty much kept my attention but I never became fully captivated with the people and their story. It failed to move me or stir me like it could have or should have.

Compare ""Defiance"" to another drama/war film like ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992): Both films are drama/war stories that largely take place in the woods. In ""Last of the Mohicans"" you came to know and care for all the major characters, and if you didn't care for them you at least understood them and their motivations (e.g. Magua); in addition to this the film is profoundly moving (remember when Alice jumps off the cliff?) and the romance palpable. In ""Defiance,"" by contrast, the only characters that come alive at all are Daniel Craig as Tuvia Bielski and his rivalrous brother Zus. The other people and their experiences never truly register.

Even ""Hornet's Nest,"" a small 1970 film with the same general theme, was more moving than ""Defiance."" If you don't believe me, check it out (although it's only available on vhs).

I don't want you to get the impression that I loathed ""Defiance."" I didn't. Again, it pretty much kept my attention and I almost shed a tear at the end, but something(s) holds it back from being truly good and moving. Reviewer C. Christopher Blackshere hints at what holds it back: The filmmakers throw in all kinds of things to try to apprehend and maintain the viewer's attention -- numerous gun battles, an airstrike and a tank -- all faithful Hollywoodisms. A little bit of this is fine, but what they really needed to do was simply focus on the characters and their gritty survival story. How about a deeper examination of man reduced to basic necessities? What about a study of man stripped of all civilized influences, struggling with the animalistic side of his/her psyche, as depicted in the excellent ""Sands of the Kalahari"" (which hasn't made it to dvd yet either)? How about the immaterial yet palpable bond of love which unites and gives life even in the worst possible conditions? There's a little of this but it doesn't go deep enough.

Regardless, there is one scene that I found thought-provoking, which Roger Ebert pointed out: A man seeks to join the ever-growing group in the woods and is asked what he does so they can determine how best to utilize his skills. He ponders it a moment and replies that he's ""an intellectual."" Of course there's little use for an intellectual in such a forest community, although they don't reject him. Back in those days, that region was largely agrarian and peasant; folks were skilled in at least one practical area as farmers, craftmen or laborers. But of what use is an ""intellectual""? How many of us are intellectuals and would be largely useless in such a senario? It goes without saying that the picture works on a what-if level. How long will our present society endure as it is before we are all forced to live primitively in the woods as depicted in the film? If and when that happens I hope you're more than just ""an intellectual.""

BOTTOM LINE: ""Defiance"" is worthwhile if the survival-in-the-woods plot piques your interest but, be forewarned, it fails to truly captivate and is only marginally better than the similarly-themed ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003).

3581503,4,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance,"" directed by Edward Zwick from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Clayton Frohman, is based on the true story of the Bielski brothers.  Tuvia and Zus Bielski had been farmers in Belarus before the German invasion.  Along with their younger brothers, Asael and Aron, they flee deep into the forest to plan a strategy for survival after the rest of their family is murdered in 1941.  What starts out as a small group of resisters continues to grow as more refugees join them.  The problems are many:  How will they elude their enemies?  What will they eat?  How will they ward off illness?  When winter comes, how will they endure the biting cold?  What will happen when, inevitably, conflicts arise?

Tuvia, played with grit and determination by Daniel Craig, is a natural leader whose authority is challenged time and again.  Although Tuvia is close to his brother, Zus (Live Schreiber), the two have a falling out and come to blows.  It seems that even when conditions are dire, it is difficult for strong-willed people to put aside their differences for the greater good.  ""Defiance"" touches on a number of themes, such as the evils of anti-Semitism, ethics vs. pragmatism, and the ways in which hope and fortitude can keep us going when all seems lost.

Although the script and the performances are serviceable, and one or two scenes are genuinely moving, Zwick relies a bit too much on well-worn Hollywood conventions.  There are the predictable romances:  Alexa Davalos (Lilka) and Mia Wasikowska (Chaya) are lovely women (they look as if they just stepped out of commercials for skin care) who attract two of the brothers.  Other stock characters are the intellectual who, out of necessity, learns practical skills, the rebellious thug who ignores Tuvia's orders, and the arrogant Russian partisan who fights alongside Zus, while barely hiding his disdain for his Jewish comrades.  During the action sequences in which our heroes fight against the Nazis, the gunshots and explosives always seem to miss the main characters by inches.  One unfortunate gaffe that has been mentioned elsewhere is the use of ampicillin (which did not exist in 1941) to treat typhus. Even if this antibiotic had been available at that time, it would have not have had any effect on this disease.  After seeing this film, you may want to read the book ""Defiance,"" by Nechama Tec, and learn a bit more about how a band of Jews fought off their enemies and, against enormous odds, pulled off the ultimate act of resistance.",1234224000,9,2516,4.90307328605201
3581504,4,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" is a riveting and very different kind of WWII movie. Director and co-writer Edward Zwick, (who directed  the Civil War film ""Glory),"" also co-wrote this remarkable film, based on the nonfiction book by Dr. Nechama Tec. Zwick dramatically brings to the big screen the true life, inspiring story of the Bielski Brothers and their partisan brigade.

When the Germans invaded Belorussia in 1941, they shot tens of thousands of Jews and confined those they did not shoot to ghettos. After the Germans killed the Bielski brothers' parents, the surviving sons fled to the forests of western Belorussia. Initially, the four brothers, Tuvia, (played by Daniel Craig, who gives a powerful and heartfelt performance), Asael, (Jamie Bell), Zus, (Liev Schreiber), and young Aaron, (George MacKay), attempted to save only their own lives by hiding from the Nazi SS troops. The Bielskis had been a farming family in a small village and knew the region well. In fact, their familiarity with the region and local customs along with some assistance from a few sympathetic gentile friends, allowed them to elude the Germans for some time. When more and more refugees from towns and shtels fled to the forests and met up with the Bielskis, the brothers made it their mission to take everyone in and form a group of partisans whose primary mission was to create a community and protect all Jewish members, regardless of age or gender. No one was ever turned away.

Thus, the group eked out a life in nearby woodlands, always keeping on the move, always steps away from the enemy. They frequently fought small battles, stealing weapons from local farmers and dead Germans and Russians, who were also anti-Semitic and thought nothing of murdering Jews. The group chose Tuvia Bielski, a charismatic leader, to command them. His brothers served as his lieutenants. The film's battle scenes are realistic, thrilling and every bit as exciting as those in ""Glory"" and other successful epic war movies.

Continuing to grow in number, they eventually formed a permanent base in a swampy, barely accessible region. Skilled workers were organized into groups - millers, bakers, teachers, those who washed clothes, and others who hunted and scoured the area for food and weapons. Although there was much suffering from the brutal winter cold, sickness and lack of food, these people were free with some hope of survival. Conflict also arose as to their mission - whether to take the strongest men and join the Soviet partisans who actively fought the Germans, or to remain a community in hiding, whose members' primary job was to live, despite the terrible odds.

As with almost any human predicament, romance also existed here, as young men and women choose ""forest spouses."" Some of these couples married after the war.

Ultimately 1200 members of the group survived. At the film's end, photographs of the brothers are shown and some details of their ultimate fates are given.

Though the film was uneven at times, the story is truly gripping and I was very moved.

""The Talmud asks why the human race was created as a single human being, as opposed to creating many people at once (like the animals which were created en masse). This teaches us that just as Adam was created in the beginning, and he was the entire human population of the world, likewise we need to look at each individual as if he/she were the entire population of the world. Therefore, when you save one life it is as if you saved the entire world.""

3581515,5,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" is one of those movies that leave you humble and amazed that not one, but many, people could survive in a harsh environment, and prevail against an enemy.

The true story of a family of brothers, the Bielskis of Belarus, ""Defiance"" presents a view of Nazi oppression unique to the usual canvas. The war is generally shown in Germany and its surrounds; Belarus, on the Russian border, is a country I've not seen on film before. And filmed in Lithuania, which is nearby, it is very authentic as a setting.

The brothers are portrayed extremely well by Daniel Craig (Tuvia), Liev Schreiber (Zus), Jamie Bell (Asael), and George MacKay (Aron). The three older brothers have been away from their home and return to find their parents killed by a Nazi sympathizer. The youngest, admirably and poignantly played by George MacKay, has been hiding in an outbuilding. The brothers gather a few supplies and retreat into the forest.

In the next few weeks, they are joined in the forest by a growing multitude of refugees, and to escape further persecution the group sets up a camp far inside the protection of the trees, with the Bielskis as camp leaders. The two older brothers, Zus and Tuvia, cannot cede leadership to each other, however; Tuvia wants to exist quietly and hopefully escape notice from the Nazis; Zus, angry and hotheaded, wants to fight. He eventually leaves to join a Russian resistance unit, taking a number of the camp men with him. Tuvia is left to manage the ever-increasing number of Jewish refugees by himself, allocating jobs to everyone in the camp.

The sheer scope of a group that size living through a harsh winter in a forest camp is boggling, as it seems that not too many are lost to the elements, although sickness seems to be prevalent. These were strong people, determined to live in the face of long odds. Tuvia does his best to provide for everyone, and deals with the inevitable malcontents brusquely and without sentimentality. He is a born leader.

Zus encounters both grudging respect and anti-Semitism from the Russian unit which he joins, and clearly seethes with resentment, but continues to fight the common enemy with singleminded zeal. He looks after his own comrades as well as he can within the confines of the chain of command, and is frustrated that the Russian leader does so little to stop his underlings from pushing the Jewish fighters around. In the back of his mind, Zus wonders how his brother is doing in the forest; and eventually, family becomes more important than the Russian unit.

A wonderfully acted movie, great script, great setting, I heartily recommend seeing this film. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber are at their best, and the rest of the cast - many from the surrounding area - are superb as well. It is amazing to me that the actual people survived so well. Each had their talents, and employed them, making a community work in the worst of times.",1233619200,6,2925,4.782178217821782
3581516,4,B001FB55JO,"Awesome director Edward Zwick and terrific acting by Daniel Craig, as well as the rest of the cast, gave Defiance the fantastic credability it was trying to achieve.

This is a wonderful and harrowing movie about Jews in WWII defying their own people turned turncoats to the Nazi regime that is trying to destroy them as a people.

Beautifully shot and action driven, Daniel Craig does a top-notch performance as the leading man Jew here who turns from an every-day man into a warrior born to lead a rag-tag group of his people deep into the woods to hide and fight as a ever-growing and unlikely army, eventually turning into hit-and-run commandos in guerilla-type warfare.

There is loss here, along with a brothership torn asunder, with romance that will all give you a riveting movie that never bores you.

3581517,1,B001FB55JO,"The Bielski family collaborated with the Red Army when the Soviets invaded Poland on September 17,1939 Their situation was relatively comfortable. Polish Catholics were targeted by the NKVD and executed or sent to the gulags. However, Jews were generally grasped to the Soviet bosom and frequently were given positions of authority.

When Hitler broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaaty on June 22. 1941, the Germans invaded the Russian occupied Nowogrodek region where the Bielski family lived and the Jews were treated badly by the Nazis, as the Polish Catholics were badly treated both by the Nazis and the Soviets.

The Bielski Partisan group did little damage to the German army. They did, however, extort and terrorize the Christian population who were, like the Bielskis, Polish citizens. The murder of 128 Christians in the village of Naliboki is generally understood to have been a Bielski war crime, one of many. The Polish Catholics had formed an underground in 1939, the AK (home army) which actively fought both the Nazi and Soviet invaders at a cost of hundreds of thousands of Catholic lives. It did more damage to the Germans than partisan activities in any other country. At the end of World War II, the Bielski family was allowed to emigrate, and most finally wound up in the USA. Polish Catholics were not allowed to flee to the West but were subjected to 50 years of Soviet occupation, worse even than that of the Nazis. Surely better role models of Jewish freedom fighters could have been found than the Bielskis.",1233100800,81,1530,4.97265625
3581518,5,B001FB55JO,"I found this movie very powerful and moving. It portrays a little known but very important part of Holocaust history. This is truly a movie depicting a courageous band of survivors. It is refreshing to see a movie about Jews who fought against their persecutors and not willing to go down without a fight.  (Some other films depicting Jews who fought back are the mini-series ""Uprising"" about the Warsaw ghetto uprising in 1943, ""The Grey Zone"" about prisoners in Auschwitz who blew up one of the crematoriums in 1944 and ""Escape from Sobibor"" about the 300 prisoners who successfully escaped from that notorious death camp in 1943, forcing the Nazis to destroy it and pretend it never existed.) This film realistically shows the grave difficulties of surviving against enormous odds. This was truly a life and death struggle.  I found myself thinking ""What would I have done?"" and ""Would I have what it took"" to survive persecution and being hunted like they were? I found it truly amazing that they survived for three years in the forest, not knowing where their next meal was going to come from and knowing that they could be betrayed, captured and killed at any time.  I am reading the book the movie is based on and it is very powerful also.

I don't know which film ""Ignorance is Bliss"" and ""No Beginning, Middle or End"" watched, but it surely wasn't the one I saw! I had no problems following the movie.  Sure, I would have liked to have seen the film show how they were liberated by the Russians in the summer of 1944, but to show everything that happened, this film would have to been done as a mini-series. I think it accurately depicted what happened in the 2 plus hours the film ran.  I agree that due to rampant and dangerous Holocaust revisionism and a troubling resurgance of anti-semitism in our time, this film is vitally important and very timely. I think the acting was great and the cinematograpy haunting. I cried also during this film. The portrayals were realistic.  I think Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell did excellent jobs. The actresses who played Tuvia's and Asael's wives did a wonderful job. I didn't find the characters to be ""cut-out"" at all. I highly recommend both the movie and book, especially for teenagers and college aged.  Maybe the two reviewers I mentioned above would appreciate the film more if they read the book and really studied Holocaust and WWII history.  This is a very important part of history and one we can learn from because prejudice and persecution will always be around as an evil plague of mankind.",1233014400,7,2570,4.71875

1. 1941: Eastern Europe (Poland, in the area that's now part of Belarus)

6. enduring terrible hardship,
7. joined by other survivors,
8. and interact with a group of Soviet partisans.
9. This is their story.

Daniel Craig plays Tuvia Bielski, a historical figure of Polish Jewish ancestry, who shepherded his flock of Jewish refugees through times of hunger, cold, grief and persecution, all the while hiding the constantly growing group in the Naliboki forest.  After avenging the deaths of his parents, Tuvia tries to adopt a less violent approach to survival, which brings him into conflict with his brother Zus (Live Schreiber) who would much rather shoot first and think later.

Another brother Asael (Jamie Bell) seems to be the shy and unassuming brother, until he steals the show by (1) getting married and (2) picking up the mantle of leadership when it was most needed.  The fourth brother Aron doesn't have much to say or do in this story.

Essentially a story of desperate survival, there are also elements of romance, pride and humanity, which coupled with the adversities of the situation, make for a dark but compelling movie.

3581520,2,B001FB55JO,"Although interesting WW-II history, as a piece of cinematic history, this movie was not very good. Unless one had read the book (which I had not), one was left to his own devices to understand what took place prior to the opening of the movie with a ragtag group of concentration camp or ghetto escapees or survivors, led by the Bielski brothers appearing out of nowhere upon the screen.

Without knowing the story of how they ended up in the Belorussian forest, their individual stories that is, the movie lacks a beginning. And watching them continue their struggles as the movie credits begin to roll at the end, one is left with the feeling that this movie has no beginning, very little of a middle, and no secure ending.

Although there is a lot of heroism via fantasized violence against German soldiers, this makes neither a ""middle to the movie,"" nor a complete story for the historical record. Nothing is resolved here? Only a couple of characters at a time appear at center stage, the others presumably are hiding out in their caves?

Did the 1200 or so actually survive the elements and the war, or not? Or, even today, are they still wandering around somewhere in the forests of Belorussia?

I could not have been more frustrated or more disappointed at the beginning, middle or end of this movie.

3581521,3,B001FB55JO,"""Defiance"" tells the story of the Bielski brothers, who saved hundreds of Jews by hiding them in the forests of Belorussia. The first third of the movie was riveting. The ne'er-do-well brothers meet after a devastating attack on their village in which loved ones have died. The only hope seems to be to take to the forests and hide. Before long, softhearted Tuvia (stony-faced Daniel Craig) is collecting stray Jews wandering the woods. Somehow, he and his brothers must manage to feed and protect this growing crowd.

The first half of the film was terrific, with well-drawn characters and frightening situations. A subplot about a non-Jewish village friend deflecting drunken local police from Jews hiding in his barn was harrowing. Another detail about the existence of ""forest wives"" was tantalizing, but left mostly unexplored. By the halfway mark though, the plot had run out of steam. The little group was involved in one extended firefight after another. And the clichs started piling up. See the grim competition among warrior brothers; see the toughening up of soft city-folk; the unexpected and unwelcome pregnancy; the poignant love story; the younger brother taking up the standard his older brother can no longer carry. Wartime clichs abound as well. How many time must we watch a character suffer through a dazed period of deafness when a bomb falls close?

Craig's character -- the tormented softie who must kill to survive -- is troublesome. First of all, I never believed that Daniel Craig, the new 007 with those cold, killer's eyes, would have any compunction about killing. Fairly early on, he proves my point, and the whole ""poor, tormented soul"" nonsense goes out the window for the rest of the film. Except for the wonderful Liev Schreiber, who plays Tuvia's gruff, brutish brother Zus, the cast is cutouts -- the scholar, the rabbi, the little brother, the girlfriend. An exception was one Russian officer, who signaled his nonchalance marvelously by whistling. But the biggest sin of ""Defiance"" was the way it turned Jewish people into anonymous ciphers. The Jews of Belorussia, hunted as faceless vermin by the Nazi extermination machine, become members of a faceless mob in this film, good only to be herded, led, bombed, strafed and shot. A series of Passover parallels is so obvious as to be distracting. And the ""Schindler's List"" ending, meant to be uplifting, is just another Holocaust movie clich that papers over the film's cinematic failings.

""Defiance"" means to honor a group of Jews who had the luck and pluck to resist a murderous regime. Ultimately, the film merely packages the Holocaust as a feel-good shoot-em-up.
