8271243,4,B0018V4ND0,"This film is one of the darkest I have seen. BBC has given us a film about the Edinburg Police Department and how crime is solved, and, well, committed.

Mark Strong as Frank Agnew is a detective in the Edinburgh Police. Brian McCardie plays Joe Geddes another DC. They both take part in a hideous crime, and then try to cover it up. Much of he crime and the reasons for the murder strain all credibility, and even as these two men try to commit the perfect crime, you can see holes in almost everything they do. Their murder victim is another detective, who it seems is violent and dirty enough to have been sent to jail, but instead he is being investigated by he 'Complaints' department. This is a much hated part of police work, a group of policemen who investigate their own suspected of criminality. In this mess comes the underworld of Edinburg, and a meat plant. I will tell you the meat plant when we finally get to see it, looks as malevolent a place that I have ever seen. Prostitutes involved, big money, some good and clever detectives, and the ring of clowns who inhabit some of these.

The real story is the cover up by these two men. I couldn't figure out if they were burned out or just plain vicious men. I hate to think this is what happens to hardened policemen. I thought they either became alcoholics or suicides. I have read recently that AMC is going to serialize, 'Low Winter Sun'. Now, this could be a real winner!  Mark Strong is superb in this role, as is Brian McCardie.  Tough, gritty, savage film, not for the faint hearted.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 09-08-12

UNFORTUNATETY, WE DON'T FIND THIS QUALITY OF DRAMA ON TV IN THE STATES.  WAS ABLE TO VIEW IT ON MY LAP TOP (NEW IN 2010), SO DIDN'T NEED A MULTIREGIONAL PLAYER.",1326412800,3,303,4.788461538461538
