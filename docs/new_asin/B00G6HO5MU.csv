6061643,3,B00G6HO5MU,"""You wanna talk about dead girls?"" Henry Lee Bishop (Fonda) is a serial killer on death row for a brutal series of murders. The home where he went on his killing spree has been turned into a web based chat house where users can log on and talk to a woman who will reenact murders for them. When the girls in the house begin to actually be killed off Detective Starks (Howard) notices a similarity between the currant murders and the Bishop killings. He questions Bishop about what is going on. For personal reasons I'd rather not get into I have a strong dislike for Peter Fonda so really any movie with him in it automatically has two strikes against it. That being said he is only in this for about 10-15 minutes so that did help. As far as the movie goes it's nothing amazing. It is a pretty cookie cutter horror movie that is pretty predictable the entire time. There is a little twist to make it more exciting but nothing that is totally out of the blue. Your basic watch girls get naked and die movie. It never felt boring or slow but it never really grabbed you and sucked you in either. The best way to describe this is a fluff-horror movie. All of that said the movie is pretty entertaining and that is really what a movie should be after all. Also don't rent it just because Terrence Howard, Peter Fonda and Queen Latifah are in it, they are in it very little. Overall, an entertaining but generic horror movie. I give it a B.",1390176000,4,1436,4.322222222222222
6061644,5,B00G6HO5MU,Great movie! Alexz Johnson did an amazing job! I'm defiantly going to buy it when it comes out. Can't wait!,1388102400,,107,4.4
6061645,1,B00G6HO5MU,"I expected a good film considering Peter Fonda, Terrence Howard and the Queen, but this felt like a B movie. The characters were ""Acting"" if you get my drift. Too bad the plot or non-plot was not developed and the unnecessary blood letting (As soon as it began I hit mute and closed my eyes) was so distasteful.

I understand ... ""The why did I rent this movie?"" Because of my respect for Peter Fonda and Terrence Howard. Sorry Latifah.",1412985600,,436,4.45

6061651,2,B00G6HO5MU,"I don't know how first-rate stars such as Peter Fonda and Terence Howard got involved with this low-budget horror-porn film. And I don't know why Queen Latifah would lend herself to a project like this, other than that it might have been a minority-run production. But grinding out cheesy exploitation flicks like this isn't likely to help any minority group.

The film has poor production values throughout. Even the newspapers that are flashed on the screen to give clues to the serial killer subject matter - are unconvincing. The newspapers don't look like anything that would be put out by a professional press. Rather, at best, they look like something that grade school students might print on hand presses and circulate as neighborhood news. The whole film has this low-grade quality and takes quite a long time to even present a comprehensible plot-line.

Its stars aren't able to provide enough redeeming value to make this schlock house worthwhile.",1402444800,,959,5.063291139240507
6061652,2,B00G6HO5MU,"The film builds the story using headlines. Henry Lee Bishop (Peter Fonda) is a convicted necrophiliac serial killer. There is a copy cat killer. The story of the killings awkwardly unfolds after the fact as Detective Starks (Terrence Howard) is questioning Bishop about the copycat killings.

Bishop's old house is owned by ""House of Bodies"" an Internet web site that specializes in recreating the killings as snuff porn for paying customers. The film subplots on Kelli (Alexz Johnson) a shy college girl who needs cash, but hasn't come to terms with nudity. She meets Kyle (Harry Zittel) on line, a shy mute.

Once the first clue hit the table, the film lost its mystery appeal as a who dun it. In fact I didn't care, I just wanted to see Kelli after all the tease and hype. The production had the makings of a good plot, but ruined it by making a boring film. They could have left out the interrogation and just made it a copy cat killing with less camera shy girls.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No real sex. Rear and photo nudity.",1393718400,,1030,4.586956521739131
6061653,1,B00G6HO5MU,so disappointing because i love terrance howardnot even worth the watch if it were free on television.  don't waist your time,1392249600,,125,4.9523809523809526
6061654,2,B00G6HO5MU,"meh... I really wish that Peter Fonda would of had more of a verbal  role, he barely spoke but a few words in each scene. Terrence Howard is a good actor deserves better roles than this one. Just didn't grab me ..the music score sucked.
Really disappointing.",1391040000,,258,4.48936170212766
8621037,2,B00G6HO5MU,"First of all how does a movie like this manage to get a cast like this? It boggles the mind that these actors would actually be willing to take part in such a @#$% show, but they did, and it was an epic disaster. Inside a house once owned by a serial killer, college girls looking for money, live, on camera 24/7, in a place where anything can happen. Ya see, they are actually part of a fetish porn website, where they can become victims at anytime and people pay big money to see this. Unbeknownst to them, the serial killer isn't dead, and one night he returns to the house, where the killings become all too real and are streamed live on the web for the whole world to see. Plain and simple this is a mildly pornographic slasher film and a bad one at that. Some big names have some small roles that are honestly beneath them, and not at all worthy of their time. Not only is the story badly written, but the film is just frustrating to watch, as it keeps switching back between the actual house and the poor quality web feed people around the world are watching. The bottom line here, there is a great cast, a title and even a preview that will attract every horror fan that sees it, but if you get sucked in, you will be highly disappointed.",1516752000,,1246,4.239495798319328
8621038,1,B00G6HO5MU,"How they got Terrance Howard, Peter Fonda and Queen Latifah to agree to be in this movie is beyond me?
It was like watching a first year film students final project.  Glad it was free or I'd be smacking myself for renting it!",1501200000,,225,4.232558139534884
8621039,1,B00G6HO5MU,"Not sure why people in this house are wearing unnecessary hoodies. Oh well, whatever. Terrence Howard, Queen LaTifah and Peter Fonda are utterly wasted in this piece of crap. The core story idea actually wasn't half bad. A deaf teen, viewing a sexy dorm site which features kinky reenacted S&M murders, sees real murders. That could have been a cool movie. So, what happened? It was the horrible directing that ruined this movie as well as the poor editing. There's a flash forward scene that they don't tell you is flash forward. It was meant to be clever - I guess- but only confused. And then get ready for the standard low budget movie ending...it just ends. No resolution, no twist, just ends. Maybe they ran out of film. LOL.",1466726400,,731,4.630769230769231

That is how bad it really is, boring characters and lousy acting ,typical 21st century generation garbage , with teenagers emailing each other during the murders of this movie. I have had it with ipods, computers, texting , and high tech. And I have to watch it done throughout a movie ! , What a waste of time , no talent no good story .The actor Peter Fonda must have been desperate for money to make this film .
