1189524,5,B0000060W6,This is one of Chuck's best movies.  I have seen it on television several times and enjoyed each and every time  I just saw it again today and hoped I could find it to buy.,1001116800,5,172,3.8857142857142857
1189525,5,B0000060W6,"In Forest Warrior, you'll see Chuck Norris as you've never seen him before!  You'll find humor, excitement, and action galore as the forest warrior (Chuck Norris) aids three children in their quest to save the  mountain from a greedy lumber mogul who's only interested in the money the  trees can bring.  You'll want to stand up and cheer when Chuck swoops down  (yes, swoops . . . I don't want to take away from the thrill of watching it  for the first time) to thwart the enemies of the forest.  So unlike his  previous movies, Chuck Norris takes a giant leap into an entirely different  genre in this movie and it does not disappoint.  I wish it would have  received better promotion, as it's thoroughly deserving.  My highest  recommendation!",919814400,6,746,4.689922480620155

1189557,3,B0000060W6,A somewhat generic wilderness kids movie about 1980s heroics and such. It's not an original concept at all though it is somewhat entertaining to 'beat the man' for the ten thousandth time. Having chuck norris in this movie added nothing of value.,1458259200,,246,4.880952380952381
1189558,2,B0000060W6,"Unless you enjoy black bars on the either side of the movies you watch, this is a horrid blu-ray cash in. Simply just an up conversion of the home video transfer as there is nothing here, aside from price or that you're a Norris completist that will make you want to buy this. Also the movie itself is just silly, laughable sure, but just another attempt, along with Sidekicks and Top Dog, for Norris to transition to kids movies. That is, until he found the TV market with Walker Texas Ranger. Worth it for an hour and a half of eye rolls and belly laughs but I doubt you watch it more than once. Aaron Norris did some fun stuff with his brother, like Hellbound and Hitman, but this not so much.",1457913600,,696,4.28030303030303

To say it in one word:
groundbreaking

I thought I knew what a movie should be.  You know, a normal balance of characterization, plot, climax, and perhaps a denouement.  Well, Chuck Norris provides us with each of those qualities to a caliber that I have never seen before. It has suspense, mystery, adventure, love, turmoil, and fatigue.  People, just pull out your credit card, drag out the dvd converter, and order this gem, you'll thank me later.  Film students, you wanna learn how to roundhouse kick the heck out of a film?  Ignore that fancy professor who stands in front of you and tells you stuff, order this masterpiece and learn how to make a movie with chest hair.  Spirit of the Mountain, protector of the winds, guardian of the trees, eagle of the night, he is, the Forrest Warrior.",1314403200,6,952,5.472602739726027
1189685,2,B0000060W6,"How was this movie not one of the greatest of all time? It was made in 1996, right in the golden era of B, and it was directed by the incomparable Aaron Norris yes the Aaron Norris. Taking it a step further, from the trailer you can see that Chuck morphs into both a hawk and a freaking bear. He also bought Vince Neil's hair from 1988 off ebay. Sid has been wanting to review this one for a long time and rightfully had very high expectations for it. We even thought we ensured a great viewing experience because we consulted the law firm of Chuck & Chuck. It seemed like a sure-fire 5 can effort but it was not meant to be. Don't get us wrong, this film was really b. When Chuck morphed into that bear it almost brought a tear to the eye. It should have been so sweet too but in the end they messed it all up. It was the last time street guys like Chuck were given a movie that B and turned it into an after school special.

Norris Sr. even had a sweet name in this one. He is McKenna, a guy in 1875 who lives on Indian land on a mountain and refuses to sell his land to people trying to build railroad tracks through McKenna's land. So the railroad tycoons kill him. Normally that would be game over, but come on man. This is Rick James. The spirit of the mountain brings McKenna back to life and turns him into a shape shifter. 120 years later, same basic deal. Except its loggers who are messing with lone wolf McKenna's land. They want to cut down the forest, including a group of 4 kids' treehouse. But Chuck said no way. He whoops some serious logger tail but its so goofy. At one point some guy's hat even gets shot off straight from a bugs bunny cartoon. What happened to the days of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hitman/dp/B000AYEL42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hitman</a>?

As we're writing this review we realize that on paper this movie looks freaking awesome but it was a year late like the Newmanium and thus quite lame. Oooh! Chuck was his usual fantastic self. He's always the perfect blend of total tough nut and where's my cheeseballs. Throw in this special variety of mullet and kicks that missed by a mile and Chuck was pretty good in this one. We're not into bashing kids but they killed this movie. Especially the little blonde girl. She couldn't have worked long after that. It's exceedingly possible that she's gotten a creepy footrub from Santa at some point if you know what I mean. I knew that you could. Anyway, this flick was B but it was an insult to the genre. Stay away at all costs, just check out the clip of Chuck morphing into the bear. It's by far the best part of the movie.",1307577600,,2666,4.438775510204081

1189699,5,B0000060W6,"""Forest Warrior"" touched me on many levels.  It is an action movie - obviously made for TV - but it speaks highly of values I believe in strongly...conservation, protection of wildlife and respect for different beliefs and cultures.

It also brings into clear focus the impact we adults have on our children around us.  They are watching and listening...and learning by what they observe we adults do whether it is right or wrong.

Good movie.",1269734400,,443,4.866666666666666
1189700,5,B0000060W6,"i love this movie i haven't seen it in years till now when i found it on amazon.com

thanks so much

p.s. CHUCK NORRIS KICKS BUTT!!",1258848000,,131,4.0
1189701,5,B0000060W6,"The reader will forgive me as I indulge in a bit of ""I've-vacationed-where-this-film-was-made"".  For me and my wife, Hood River, Parkdale, and Lost Lake on the North slope of Mount Hood in Oregon is not merely our favourite place to vacation - it's the ONLY place to vacation!

Seeing the film, we recognize places we love to spend every summer that we can.

On our way to Lost Lake, we fuel up at the very gas station that was featured prominently in the film.  We've rowed our boat right past the place wher the kids played in the waters of the lake with the baby bear.

The Mountain you see in the film is clearly Mount Hood, the most beautiful of all the Cascade Mountains.

Therefore, if having been to the lovely and serene place where this movie was made, and loving it as much as I do, gives me a built-in bias in favor of ""Forest Warrior"", then so be it.

Forget about the fact that Chuck Norris, in real life, supports the very politicians who support [and get their support from] the very kind of men his character fights against in the film.  Let's just cut to the story.

The young drunk father, a former Sheriff's Deputy [once a real good one, so we are told], is now living in the bottle sinc ehe and his daughter have been bandoned by his wife, and he works in the gas station when he is sober enough to stay upright.  The story of his fall and redemption plays well as it's intertwined with the fight that his daughter and her friends wage against a logging tycoon who looks at the forest and sees only dollar signs.

It is this sub-plot of fall and redemption that provides a theme to the film that many others overlook, regardless of whether they praise the film or condemn it.

The careful viewer will recognize Loretta Swit [""Hot Lips"" from M*A*S*H]as the owner of the gas station, and mother of two of the boys in the ""Lords of Tanglewood"" group who later take on the loggers with guerilla tactics, and the help of Chuck Norris as a shape-shifting Spirit Of The Mountain.

Rent or buy this movie, but don't stop there!  Follow that with a vacation of your own to Oregon, to Hood River, and Parkdale, and Lost Lake Resort up on Mount Hood.  Get a tent and camp up there for a few days, and take it all in for yourself.

Experience the place where this film was made, and then you might feel for yourself what ""Forest Warrior"" is all about.",1216512000,2,2360,4.353881278538813
1189702,5,B0000060W6,this movie is great for children to learn about the forrest if they are unable to get to one and how to appericate what mother nature has given us and to respect it and take care of it.

1189703,3,B0000060W6,"There's just something about Chuck Norris. Is it the hair? Is it the roundhouse kicks? Is it the lost list of credentials?

Who cares? He's Chuck Norris, and he's as Chuck Norris as he's ever been in Forest Warrior, a story about a group of young tree-huggers who embark on a fun-filled camping adventure to ""the mountain."" But wait, what's this? Ne'er-do-well lumberjacks and bad, meany business men want to log the mountain. Not if Chuck Norris has anything to say about it.

With the help of the bafoonish fighting skills of the antagonists, Chuck Norris saves the day again and again. And each time is more entertaining as he transforms into a hawk, and a wolf, and a bear, and the omnipresent spirit of the mountain, which is always there to lend a hand when situations get sticky.

The acting is awful, the script is worse, and the special effects are laughable. But honestly, what more can we expect from Walker, Texas Ranger? Clad in ill-fitting leather shirts and wielding the power of 100 men, Chuck Norris comes to the rescue, to yet again save America's youth from the greed of big business.

The kids are the real stars, and though protecting the envirnment is one of the lessons the movie trys to show, and even better storyline are the people learning how to pick themselves up and not quit when life knocks them down.  The father, played by Michael Beck, coming to realize what is really important. His failing and redemption was a major enjoyment for me in this movie.  The kids caring for the mountain habitat is catching.  And I thought the hijinks the kids used to stall for time against the bad developers was a riot! LOL!!

7903588,1,B0000060W6,when ordering it I thought it said it was on dvd besides blue ray so I was very surprised when I got it but will be keeping it because I will be getting a blue ray player in the near future.,1491436800,,190,3.658536585365854
7903589,2,B0000060W6,Seriously dumb movie with all the cliche bad guys. The loggers are made out to be bad and stupid and the kids the crusaders of all good. Chuck Norris is some sort of forest spirit who beats people up. So corny but two stars for being clean.,1488412800,,240,4.127659574468085
