8584350,4,B00CP6YO6S,"Bjorling's early life is well-documented, but his later years are not detailed as well as they could have been.  There was also less video footage of Bjorling singing than I would have liked.",1495411200,,191,4.787878787878788
8584351,5,B00CP6YO6S,The name says it all.  Jussi Bjoerling was a gift from God.  No other tenor voice compares.  A superb musician!,1407628800,4,111,4.45

8584353,5,B00CP6YO6S,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE OPRATIC SINGER THAT I ADMIRED AS A VOCAL STUDENT.HIS INTERPRETATIONS ARE SENSATIVE A VERY MUSICAL,SHOWING GREAT KNOWLEDGE IN HIS SUBJECT MATTER.THE VOICE PRODUCTION.",1395705600,4,184,5.851851851851852
8584354,4,B00CP6YO6S,"I liked this DVD as a biography and it came up to expectations as such.  Jussi Bjorling's voice is superb but we have come to expect nothing less.  I should have loved it, had it double the amount of singing but that is not to be expected with a biography.  Nevertheless, it was well worth the price and certainly was not a disappointment.  I have watched and enjoyed it a number of times already - mainly to hear his incomparable voice.",1381104000,7,437,4.3580246913580245
8584355,4,B00CP6YO6S,"Given that this is the only video biography of Jussi Bjorling currently available, it is by default the best one. But on its own merits it stands up very well also. The obvious flaw is that the narration is in Swedish with English subtitles, which detracts a bit from full enjoyment, but there is a lot of information and many interviews. Actors play young Jussi and his brothers as they toured with their father as ""The Bjorling Quartet"" and give a real sense of what it might have been like for them after their father died. Bjorling's virtues were many and they are well displayed, but his flaws are covered as well with his alcoholism and his (2) illegitimate children not glossed over. For a definitive work on the singer, read Anna-Lisa Bjorling's book ""Jussi.""",1375142400,12,767,4.688888888888889
