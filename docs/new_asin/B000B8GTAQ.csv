2408452,1,B000B8GTAQ,"I am very disappointed and IRRATATED, I receieved the PSP UMD movie Sandlot1/Sandlot2 in a very timely manner, however when I opened the holder they both fell out and I looked at the discs they both had like white smudges and it looked scratched up, I do realize that they were used, but it said very good condition, I then tried to play them both in my PSP and they both don't work.....I then emailed flinthills market and nobody responded to me, so I just spent $20.00 for nothing...basically.",1234137600,,495,4.573033707865169
2408453,5,B000B8GTAQ,Both my five year old & 2 year old LOVED this gift! They watch it all the time now on their PSP and it was quite the bargain for both movies! Definitely recommended! ~ Mommy in CA,1169078400,3,179,3.864864864864865

2408462,4,B000B8GTAQ,"I love the sandlot movie but the second one was not that great Scott smalls in the first movie lost a priceless baseball in the backyard of the BEAST the biggest and the worst dog of all time . Benny Rodriguez pickled the BEAST and got the ball back they went to the BEAST""home and really got a shock when Mr Merdal tells them that he would have gotten the ball back for the kids . In the Sandlot 2 pretty much the same thing happened but on a much dumber version of the movie I was not thrilled with the movie",1398470400,,510,4.009803921568627
2408463,4,B000B8GTAQ,My son was excited. He is almost 18 and this was his all time favorite movie when he was little.,1395878400,,96,3.85
2408464,4,B000B8GTAQ,"These two movies are both nice movies for kids. The first one is a classic and definutly superior, but they are both a lot of fun in their own ways. What mainly sets them apart is the contrast of main plot lines. The first is about kids playing baseball and accidently finding themselves in a local myth, while the second is more about relationship between players and the time period the film takes place in, with another myth thrown in randomly. They both also have a few basic life lessons and some fun humor to entertain slightly older viewers.

For those you have seen the first and not the second, I should warn you that the third act is a lot like the first film. Hopefully like me, you'll enjoy the first two thirds to forgive that part somewhat. It's thanks to that, I had to drop a star from this combo packs score.

Ultimatly Sandlot 5/5, Sandlot 2 3/5 but you should expereince it and find your own opinon.",1394928000,,918,4.394117647058824

2408468,2,B000B8GTAQ,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD or I think that was the problem.  I started with Sand Lot 2 and throughout i it occasionally had periods where it seemed to stall for a few seconds.  At the conclusion I was unable to view because it completely stalled.  When I tried to remove the DVD  it took several attempts as it seemed to hung .  I can't be sure its not the DVD  player because I was afraid to put the  Sandlot  one in the DVD.  i  will try with another DVD.  Thanks for asking,",1391731200,,500,4.0
