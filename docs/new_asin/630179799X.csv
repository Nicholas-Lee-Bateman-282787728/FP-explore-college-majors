364683,4,630179799X,"Possible spoilers.  While reorganizing my video collection I came across my Blu ray package of Mel Brooks films.  I was in the mood for something funny so pulled out this chestnut from 1981.  Brooks is at his best playing a double handful of characters during various times in human history.  It all begins with a satirical take on the opening scene of Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey.  While Also Sprach Zarathustra plays we see a group of apes go from 4 legged mobility to standing upright on 2, then as the music hits it crescendo, all of the apes begin to, uh pleasure themselves.  The punchline banner comes across stating Our Forefathers.

The next sequence features Sid Caesar as a caveman who is also an artist.  But of course with the artist comes the art critic, who doesnt particularly like the drawing of a horse.  Next comes a scene from the Old Testament where Brooks as Moses receives the Commandments from God.  Initially he is given 3 tablets but drops one so quickly ad libs 15, uh 10 Commandments.  There is a musical scene involving the Spanish Inquisition where Brooks plays Tomas de Torquemada, the grand inquisitor.  It involves a slot machine made of Jews and an armada of synchronized swimmers who drop their nuns habits and dive into the pool.

The largest section of the film is during the time of the Roman Empire.  Brooks plays Comicus, a standup philosopher.  He along with his agent Swiftus (Ron Carey) get a gig at Caesars Palace playing in front of Nero (Dom DeLuise) and the Empress Nympho (the great Madeline Kahn).  Comicus bombs, so must escape along with Swiftus and 2 new friends; Miriam the vestal virgin (Mary-Margaret Humes) and Josephus, a former slave played by Gregory Hines.

The final story leaps ahead to the time of French King Louis (Brooks) who also plays the palace piss boy, in essence a mobile urinal.  While all of the segments are funny and feature a whos who of comedians of the era, some will likely tickle your fancy more than others.

This Blu ray disc is a big budget visual feast for the eyes.  The 1080p, 2.35:1 aspect ratio is as good as there is.  Great colors, excellent black levels and an overall great looking picture.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is also amazingly good.  The package includes a Mono mix, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 options.  Subtitles come in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean and Mandarin.",1502668800,,2431,4.719714964370547

The cavemen jokes were dumb, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing. The Roman part was generally funny. The big Spanish Inquisition musical number was... well, the concept was funny, but the sketch was ten minutes of that one joke.

365053,3,630179799X,"Mel Brooks takes you from 20,000,000 years ago, when ""the ape stood and became man"", through the 1789 French Revolution, where the Count de Money (dee mow NEIGH) meets Madame de Farge.

In between, there's the Roman Empire with the Empress Nympho, the Spanish Inquisition and the Black Plague of 1489. You even find out how Leonardo da Vinci painted ""The Last Supper.""

It's all told with tired humor and mostly ineffective sight gags, though Gregory Hines as a Roman slave who tap dances through his slave auction is a highlight.

For me, ""History of the World Pt 1"" is 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. Mel Brooks has moments of comic genius, but this movie didn't have them.

Mel Brooks directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one of them. Eight of his movies, including ""History of the World Pt 1,"" are collected in a slipcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks-Bx-Sm-Cb/dp/B000EBIONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks Bx Sm Cb</a>.

It's a fun romp through history from the caves to The French ""Fronch"" Revolution.  No matter how you look at it, History of the World is guaranteed to educate the gullible, give a laugh to the common folk and cause conniptions in the uptight.",1431129600,,422,4.30379746835443

If you want to learn of history, there are better sources, such as anything else.  If you want to laugh, then pull up a chair.  This is clearly not Mel Brooks' best, but his best were among the best comedies ever(Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, etc.)  This picture is a bit uneven, with some historical periods hilarious(Roman) and some odd(the Inquisition) and even controversial.
The plot is a romp thru history, with the French revolution, the Spanish Inquisition, the birth of Man(a spoof of 2001, among other things), the Roman Empire, etc.  You see those actors that Mel Brooks was comfortable with from Vegas or his prior films.
If you're like me, you will find the Spanish Inquisition part not so much controversial as merely unfunny.
The best part of this film oddly was not the film itself but the closing credits featuring future attractions.  This absurd and hilarious added-on reel, featuring 'Hitler on Ice', etc., made you ready for the sequel.  Alas, the 'future attractions' was merely a ploy to have an ending and generate 'water cooler buzz'.  There never was a sequel planned...
For Mel Brooks fans this is a must-have.  For others, it's hit or miss.  If you always wanted a comedic take on serious historical events, then this is the only game in town.  If a sophomoric viewpoint on these events is condescending in your view, then just keep on truckin' and skip this altogether.",1418774400,,1488,4.916

While not as great as some of his other works, it is still notably better than the latter period of his career and fits in nicely with the ""golden"" years, when Mel could do no wrong. I really wish he would have continued on with this movie and done more parts, which is probably the only real criticism that could be put against this.

365964,4,630179799X,"Mel Brooks made some of the most uproarious and inspired `spoofs', many of which have been considered classics and have been lauded by legions of fans for years.  His usual cast of characters (and repeat actors) sunk their teeth into his breed of humor with some splendid results, and over the years he brought to the table fresh takes on everything from the Bible to Robin Hood to Frankenstein.  I recently got my hands (and eyes) on `History of the World: Part I' (there never was, nor ever will be a part II) and I have to say that Brooks and company do not disappoint.  It's not my favorite Brooks, but he manages to make some pretty broad strokes in the history books, creating humor out of some very taboo subjects.  The narration from Orson Welles was totally inspired, and while I found the opening `caveman' sequences to be rather dull, the film really picks up and lays down the funny once Dom DeLouis enters the picture as Emperor Nero, and the funny continues through a lavish musical number on the Inquisition and a bleed into the French Revolution.  With rich sets and costumes and some inspired humor, `History of the World: Part I' ends on a really, really strong note.",1384128000,,1185,4.597156398104265

But it's awesome to show people my age, who've likely seen Spaceballs and Blazing Saddles and blow their minds all over again. I suppose I'm ruining the joke but there is no Part 2, so good luck with that.

Despite it's age it has aged very gracefully and is still quite funny and relevant today. Definitely worth showing to your kids (yes there's swearing, get over yourselves) and making them fans of Brooks' parody comedic styling.",1383177600,,586,4.4766355140186915

My family and I talk and laughed about some of the scenes REPEATEDLY, so I decided we have to get the movie (as it is not available on Netflix streaming). A great movie to have in your collection. The reason to buy the disc, is many of the scenes are so hilarious, you need to disc to play them over-and-over again. I took away one star as the quality of transfer from film to Blu-Ray was decent, but not superior. However, it is still worth adding to your movie collection.",1383004800,,518,4.242424242424242

I do recommend this movie to any true Mel Brooks fans.  If you are the type who only liked Men in Tights or Spaceballs (yes both great movies), you might just see this as a very random film, but if you pay attention you will catch a lot of lines that are in Men in Tights (as well as the melody from the group song in Men in Tights).

366105,2,630179799X,"Mel Brooks just might have the single most enviable track-record among filmmakers. he directed 11 films, 9 of which - THE PRODUCERS, THE TWELVE CHAIRS, BLAZING SADDLES, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, HIGH ANXIETY, SPACEBALLS, LIFE STINKS, ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, DRACULA: DEAD & LOVING IT - range from delight to masterpiece. (and i'm not sure i don't dislike SILENT MOVIE solely because i'm not fond of silent cinema.) to say nothing of the fact that he created the single greatest series in the history of American television, GET SMART.
but it seems even Mel was to be allotted an ""off-day."" (actually two, if you count the horrendous remake of TO BE OR NOT TO BE he produced and starred in, but i'd rather not go into that here.) Mel frequently describes this unbelievably crass production as ""the height of my vulgarity."" i suspect that's because even he recognizes how much more of an impression the vulgarity than the alledged humor leaves.
the film is divided into five segments. the first, The Stone Age, is a series of inane one-note jokes. in the hands of Brooks' ex-mentor, Sid Ceasar, it produces a couple of smirks, but no guffaws. (what really blows my mind about the film is that Orson Welles agreed to narrate it. not so much because of how far beneath CITIZEN KANE this is as because it proved such a limited role. the Stone Age segment is the only pariticularly meaty one for him, what with cavemen having no language as yet.)
the second, The Ten Commandments, is the funniest thing in the movie. as a cautious cynic when it comes to religion, i LOVE the notion that there were actually 15 Commandments before Moses dropped and broke the third tablet. but alas, it is less than 90 seconds of a 92 minute movie.
the third, set in Rome, is surprisingly strong on story. (it does, after all, take up more than half the film's running length.) it has so much potential, in fact, that if i had a time machine i would go find Mel in 1980 and try to persuade him to scrap everything else and concentrate the whole film on Rome. oh, the curse of missed opportunities...
the fourth is just bizarre. basically, it converts The Spanish Inquisition into an elaborate swim/dance routine a' la Buzby Birkley.
the fifth, The French Revolution, basically riffs on Mark Twain's THE PRINCE & THE PAUPER. Mel plays the tyrannical King and his more kindly ""piss boy"" doppleganger. if the notion of a comic take on The French Revolution intrigues you, you would be better served by Bud Yorkin's START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, starring Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland.
actually six, if you count the would-be trailer for HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART II. the funniest thing about this is that a number of people clearly didn't ""get"" how Mel's mind (perhaps even comedy in general) works, so they were baffled when the comically proposed sequel never actually materialized!!
the lesson here is that creative arts are a crap shoot, for genuises as well as mere talents. please forgive Mel!",1359244800,3,2976,4.725

We open with a take-off on the opening scenes of 2001, and continue with a variety of scenes concerning cave men. Sid Caesar plays the head cave man, including the birth of the first artist followed by the after-birth, the first critic. We spend considerable time in Rome during Caesar's reign (Dom DeLouise, with Madeline Kahn as his consort). Brooks is a ""stand-up philosopher"" who gets a gig at Caesar's Palace, which looks a lot like the one in Vegas. Gregory Hines plays Josephus, a slave who was rescued from being fed to the lions in the Coliseum . . . and then it gets complicated.

Brooks also plays Torquemada with a chorus line of priests for the Spanish Inquisition, King Louis during the French Revolution, and just before he is to be executed, he is rescued by Josephus in the same chariot from back at the Roman Empire and the same horse named Miracle because, as he points out, movies are magic.

There are plenty of cheap puns and potty jokes, sexual innuendos and slapstick, and altogether a fast-paced and completely insane comedy which bears a very, very tangential relationship to the real history of the world.

366196,4,630179799X,"History of the World Part 1
Blu-Ray (1981, 2010)

""History of the World: Part 1"" was written and directed by Mel Brooks in 1981. Mel Brooks' silly parody of history makes it onto Blu-Ray with a sharper picture and better sound. Whether it is cavemen, ancient Rome, the Spanish Inquisition, and the French Revolution, it still tickles the funny bone to watch. There are so many great quotes!

""You flunked flank? Get the flunk out of here!""
and of course...
""It's good to be the King.""

More so than the longer stories in Rome and France, the quickie jokes with Moses, the Cavemen, Jesus, and the Inquisition are the funniest parts of this film. A few jokes in the script are more dated now but most hold up very well still! This is one of most hilarious takes on history since ""Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail"" but it goes over several different periods of time when each short could have been made into its own full-length feature.

Mel himself takes on several roles as Moses, a stand-up philosopher in Rome, the leader of the Spanish Inquisition, and double roles as the king of France and the piss boy in one story. He never takes on an accent but he doesn't have to. He sets up silly situations and comparisons to modern times and is never afraid to just go there and feels the more ridiculous, the better.

Orson Welles has one of the best voices on film ever and he actually narrates a few of the sequences linking the film together. Other fantastic actors involved are Dom DeLuise as Emperor Nero the fat pig, Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho who gets to choose partners for her evening orgy, Harvey Korman as Count de Monet (""Count the money, count the money""!), Gregory Hines as dancer/slave Josephus, and Sid Caesar as the Chief Caveman.

Unfortunately ""History of the World: Part 2"" advertised at the end was never made into a film though I know we'd all like to see Hitler on Ice and Jews in Space!

Blu-Ray Features:

This movie has been watched dozens of times by many people, but there is now a ""Real History of the World"" Trivia Track that you can play along the bottom of the screen while watching! It's a great way to learn some new facts while watching and mostly confirms actual years things began like that scientists now believe man discovered fire way earlier than the previous estimate. Occasionally facts are revealed about the movie as well such as the Vestal Virgins were played by Playboy Playmates. There is also an isolated score track that can be used with the film.

There is a featurette on Mel's love of musicals and how his movies always incorporate a musical number into them at some point. When they were selecting portions of history that they wanted to visit in this film, they just decided to make ""The Inquisition"" a big elaborate number and the further and more ridiculous he went with it and the more wrong it became, the more RIGHT it became and now it is one of the most remembered sequences of the film. This featurette talks about the different elements of the number and how the swimming nuns were able to come out of the water dry with sparklers on their heads, etc.

The last featurette is ""Making History: Mel Brooks on Creating the World"" on how easily the jokes came when writing the script and piecing the time periods together. Richard Pryor was originally slotted to have a role in the film but had an accident and Gregory Hines was brought in for screen testing and was instantly given the part. Orson Welles was booked for one-week's worth of work to narrate ""History of the World"" but since he did most of it in one take, he was finished by 4:30pm the very first day. This film has developed into almost a cult classic.",1273708800,7,3693,4.5398496240601505

the movie boring though,and it was watchable.as a movie,it's not
bad.as a comedy,it's a different story.if i hadn't known it was
supposed to be a comedy,i would have had different expectations.i'm not

366200,4,630179799X,"The moment I saw the opening scene with our shaggy forefathers reaching for the sky--and then dropping their hands to masturbate--I knew this was going to be a crude & bawdy Mel Brooks comedy. The bad news: Written solely by Brooks and, of course, directed by him, any failings the movie has rests squarely on his shoulders. Being an episodic collection  of moments in history, it has so many highs & lows that you're laughing out loud one minute and groaning the next. The pace tends to ramble on, making the film feel longer than it really is. The good news: The cast reads like an alumni of ""Mel Brooks movie graduates""...Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Ron Carey, Dom DeLuise, Cloris Leachman...plus, guest appearances by everyone from Hugh Hefner & Henny Youngman to Bea Arthur & the great dancer-actor Gregory Hines (the latter is quite funny in this one). My faves: Mel's former T.V. ""boss"", the great Sid Caesar, does some ingenious pantomime in the ""Stone Age"" segment; the satirization of ""The Last Supper"" painting; the overblown Spanish Inquisition production number (you have to admire a mind that can come up with such ribald lunacy); and the French Revolution (Mel is raunchy fun here as King ""It's Good to be the King"" Louis).
But the bit that's probably the funniest is the coming attractions for ""Part 2"", with ""Hitler on Ice"", a Viking funeral & ""Jews in Space"" (Mel's spoofing of ""Star Wars"", years before ""Spaceballs"" came along).
This is a Brooks comedy that's pretty much a mixed offering: Some parts you'll like, and others, you'll dislike. It depends on your tastes.",1256947200,3,1589,4.863468634686347

The film is not as all encompassing as its title implies, but Mel gives his own twisted vision to these particular times in earth's history, which includes Mel himself in four different roles, including Moses and his own version of Louis XIV (It's Good to be the King). Mel gathers his usual nutty repertory company together and laughs are provided by Sid Ceasar (very funny as a caveman), Madeline Kahn and Dom DeLuise (hysterical as Cleopatra and Ceasar), Gregory Hines, Cloris Leachman, and Harvey Korman as Count De Money (""That's De Monay!!!).

Some of my favorites include, ""Do I have any openings this man might fill? (from the side, ""Whoooaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh)"", and just about everything from the Spanish Inquisition song. Also the scene when they make the huge blunt to ""smoke out"" their pursurers is great. Having said that, I do have some complaints.

  If this movie weren't so funny, I'd be sorely disappointed in the DVD. There are no special features, short of the theatrical trailer. If you're looking for an introspective look into Brooks' creative process (i.e., asking how the hell you came up with that Spanish Inquisition scene,) you're gonna have to ask the man himself, 'cause he didn't answer it here.

The first time period is the Stone Age, where we see the first homosapien and homosexual marriage, and discover how music was invented. Next, in a very short bit, we see Moses coming down from a mountain with the 15 commandments, until he drops one slab, and it becomes the 10 commandments. The next era is the Roman Empire, where after Philatipis[or something like that] gets a gig to do comedy for Caescar, he offends, the emporer, so him and his new found friend must fight each other to the death, but instead stop fighting and try to escape from Rome. The 4th era is by far the funniest, and the most offensive, The Spanish Inquisition. So in a musical extravaganza, we see how the Catholics tried to convert the Jews to become Catholics, and in the last part, we behold the French Revolution, and one of the greatest lines in this movie. So, see this hilarious movie, but if you are easily offended, then do not see this. The only thing that aggravates me was that Brooks had a part 2 planned out, but it was never released.

You get to see prehistoric man invent art, and along with the first art came the first art critic. We see the real story behind Moses and the Ten Commandments. The best part to me was the part about the Roman times, when Comicus the stand up philosopher is introduced. I was laughing long and hard when Comicus gets a job as waiter at the Last Supper. Also spoofed are the Spanish Inquisition and the French Revolution.

Then the Caveman era with hilarious looks at how paintings where developed, Critics, Death, and Music.

Maybe if this movie was a bit more known, then it would have come with some bonus features?

366502,4,630179799X,"When this film first appeared more than 20 years ago, it temporarily threatened to replace world history courses in schools, colleges, and universities. Of course, that didn't happen. Probably just as well, given the fact that screenwriter, producer, and director Mel Brooks never wrote, produced, and directed Part II and its eagerly-awaited portrayals of ""Jews in Space"" and ""Hitler on Ice."" There are historians' homes in which Brooks is still not welcome. In any event, what we have in Part I is a combination of five extended sketches: The Dawn of Man, The Stone Age, The Spanish Inquisition, The Bible, and The Future. Inevitably there are some gaps.

Brooks appears in several different roles while (in fact) portraying himself: Moses, Comicus, Torquemada, and King Lou. Other members of the Brooks Ensemble Company include Madeline Kahn (Empress Nympho), Cloris Leachman (Madame de Farge), Harvey Korman (Count de Monet), Ron Carey (Swiftus), Andreas Voutsinas (B'ernaise), and Shecky Green (Marcus Vindictus). Brooks has assembled a cast of thousands. The production values are remarkably good. However, as in other Brooks films such as Blazing Saddles and High Anxiety, the quality of the humor varies from Brilliant & Inspired (e.g. King Lou professing love of ""the little people"" while shooting at airborn peasants who have been launched as targets: ""Pull!"") to Oh No (e.g. Moses reducing the number of Commandments to Ten by dropping/breaking one of three tablets while descending Mount Sinai, and, Jesus becoming confused by use of his name as an expletive). Brooks is an incurable gagster and punster. More often than not, the humor in this film works. But when it doesn't....

Several clever touches. For example, beginning the film with a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey, with Orson Welles providing the voice-over. Also, it is fun to play the equivalent of ""Where's Waldo"" by trying to spot familiar actors in supporting roles such as Bea Arthur (Clerk), Charlie Callas (Soothsayer), Jack Carter (Rat Vendor), Sid Caesar (Chief Caveman), John Gavin (Marche), Ronny Graham (Oedipus), Nigel Hawthorne (Official), John Hillerman (Rich Man), Hugh Hefner (Entrepreneur), Barry Levinson (Column Salesman), Spike Milligan (Monsieur Rimbaud), Howard Morris (Court Spokesman), Jan Murray (Nothing Vendor), and Henny Youngman (Chemist). As I said, a cast of thousands...if not more.

Brooks' best films, those most effectively developed, are The Producers and Young Frankenstein, the latter being a remarkably respectful version of several earlier films. All comics are thieves. The best comics steal from the best sources. I thought about that when I saw this film again recently, wondering if Brooks' History of the World -- Part I was in any way influenced by The Story of Mankind (1957), a film based on Henrik Willem Van Loon's bestseller. For purposes of parody, The Story of Mankind would be an excellent target of opportunity. Those among its diverse cast of thousands (if not more) include Charles Coburn'(Hippocrates), Ronald Colman (The Spirit of Man), Cedric Hardwicke'(High Judge), Dennis Hopper'(Napoleon), Hedy Lamarr'(Joan of Arc), Peter Lorre'(Nero), Virginia Mayo'(Cleopatra), Chico Marx'(Monk), Harpo Marx'(Isaac Newton), Groucho Marx'(Peter Minuit),  Agnes Moorehead'(Elizabeth I), Vincent Price (The Devil), and Cesar Romero'(Spanish Envoy). Whenever a list of the Ten Most Pretentious Movies Ever Made is formulated, The Story of Mankind is frequently and deservedly given serious consideration.

Despite its several flaws, The History of the World -- Part I remains a generally entertaining, at times hilarious film. Whenever I see it again, I feel eager anticipation as I await its strongest scenes, willing to endure its weakest meanwhile. To me at least, the previews for Part II (which conclude Part I) suggest why Brooks resembles the Little Girl with The Curl: ""When she's good, she's very very good but when she's bad....""",1078790400,13,3960,5.432520325203252

Lots of comedic actors, great and small, make side-splitting appearances in the film, including Sid Ceasar, Harvey Korman, Dom DeLuise, Bea Arthur, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Jackie Mason, and Gregory Hines.

The beauty of Brooks' scathing spoofs of historical events and figures is that the humor is timeless, holding up just as well today as it did when the film was originally released in 1981.  If you have never seen or heard of this film, rent or buy it now, as you have missed an iconic movie.  I've even heard of European History professors using Brooks' wacky take on the Spanish Inquisition in their history classes.

  Several of my friends recently suggested that I see History of The World, and considering their praise and the reputation of the producer, Mel Brooks, I couldn't wait to see the movie.  I quickly went to my favorite online store (amazon.com ofcourse) to see what deals they had and to read other people's reviews of the movie.  I was supprised at the wide range of opinions, so I decided to slow myself down and go rent the movie first, which was definately a good choice.
  Although I do suggest that everyone see History of The World  atleast once, I personally have no desire to watch it a second time.  Despite a slow start, which had me almost wanting to turn the movie off and go watch SportsCenter, the movie picks up a little bit and provides several solid jokes that actually may get you laughing outloud.  In my opinion, History of The World does not stand up to such great Mel Brooks films as Space Balls or Robin Hood- Men In Tights.  Although im sure that the original comedy in this film made it a true hit when it first came out, the sad truth is that more than half of the jokes from this early 80's film have not faired well against the test of time.

366536,2,630179799X,"This is not a funny movie. There is a difference between being nasty and unfunny, and being funny with the occasional bad joke. Until I saw this, I thought that Mel Brooks was the latter, but this movie is most certainly the former.
It starts out with the cavemen. This part really isn't so bad, so much as stupid. Sid Ceasar does a good job as the head caveman, with the occasional slightly funny slapstick bit.
Following it is the old testament, where Moses finds the ten commandments. Along with the ""Spanish inquisition song"" it's about the only funny part in the whole entire film.
The Roman empire: A bunch of sex jokes. 'Nuff said.
The Spanish Inquisition: About the only funny part in the film. Wish it was longer.
The French Revolution: I didn't even get through the whole thing. I turned it off after the scene where King Louis (Brooks) plays a human chess game that ends up in a gang bang on the queen.

366538,2,630179799X,"""Do you wanna dance?""
It used to be such a funny line.  We'd laugh ourselves silly, pretending to be Roman centurions inhaling pot smoke, taking turns saying the line: ""Do you wanna dance?""  We'd say it with the same faux-hippie lilt that Shecky Greene used, smooth and adrift.  We'd pretend that macho men suddenly wanting to dance with each other was not homophobic... but hilarious!  We used to be so young, and this movie was so fresh and funny.
So what happened?  We grew up.  And Mel Brooks' little comedy didn't.  Now don't get me wrong.  Scatalogical and bigoted humour doesn't generally offend me.  If you're racist *and* funny, then you probably have a point to make.  You're a satirist.  However, if you're racist and unfunny, then your point is lost, or irrelevant.  Then you're just racist.  More often than not, the latter is true here.
The history of Mel Brooks' filmmaking career says that his best work came during the late sixties and early seventies, when ""The Producers"", ""Young Frankenstein"", and ""Blazing Saddles"" cornered the market on comedy.  Each was smartly written, realistically acted (in context, of course), and narrowly focussed.  This combination worked well, creating three bitingly funny satires, still considered classics of the genre.  Sadly, by the time the seventies ended, and the eighties began, Brooks' seemed to have forgotten the lessons he learned.  Case in point: ""History of the World: Part 1"".
It's sure not smartly written, by today's standards anyway.  Many of the most memorable jokes are only moderately funny due to excessive repetition.  The film's most famous line, ""It's good to be the king"", is said maybe half a dozen times during the last sketch, 'The French Revolution'.  ""Hey, I remember that joke from the first time I chuckled at it,"" is Brooks' desired response from the audience.  ""Maybe I should laugh again, only harder this time!""  The repeated reemergence of Miracle the horse, which wasn't funny the first time, and the pronounciation of Count de Monet's name, which was, are both beaten into the ground via the same technique.  It gets tiresome quickly.
To be fair, there are some moments of witty wordplay; if you have a machete and some patience you might find them.  ""With the birth of the artist came the inevitable afterbirth -- the critic"", from the Prehistoric Man segment, is but one example.  The Roman Empire section is chock full of quick, blink-and-you'll-miss them jokes, the kind that should have been peppered throughout the film.  ""Buffet and Orgy: First Served, First Come"" reads one side.  ""You're nuts!  N-V-T-S nuts!"" says Ron Carey's character, Swiftus.  ""Sic Transit Gloria,"" says one senator to another, prompting the reply, ""I didn't know Gloria was sick.""  Sure, they're groaners.  But they're clever groaners.
The acting, even more so than the substandard writing, is a big problem.  Brooks gathers around him a group of comedians trying desperately to make the material work.  They strain too hard, and the comedy is the first casualty.  A better tactic might be the one employed by the ""Airplane!"" movies: super-serious actors, delivering hilarious material, with straight faces.  That's a lethal comedic combination.  Here we get Sid Caeser's furious mugging, Charlie Callas' gross facial contortions, and Greene's over-acting.  Madeline Khan, usually dependable and understated, is a mess here.  Her annoying double-takes and piercing voice makes this wonderful comedienne difficult to watch.  Dom DeLuise's performance typifies everything that's wrong with this movie.  Just when you think he's got a sly take on an idea -- his Caeser is a gluttonous, flatulant, apathetic dictator -- he goes overboard with the facial contortions and the buffoonish slapstickery.  DeLuise more often than not gets his character right, but when it's wrong, it's just embarassing to watch.
There are some performers here who turn in fine work.  Cloris Leachmann does a raucous, but low-key, turn as the leader of a group of French insurgents.  They're condemned to an existnece without a language, ""just a stupid accent... we all talk like Maurice Chevalier!""  Harvey Korman is amusing as a French Count.  And Brooks, for the most part does well with his acting.  A brief turn as Moses, bickering under his breath with God, is the movie's highlight.  And he's tailor-made for the part of Comicus, the Roman stand-up philospher who gets his big break: playing Caeser's Palace.
The broad focus of the film, trying on too many ideas that aren't fleshed-out enough to really smoke, also hurts the film.  It might have worked if Brooks had stuck just with the Roman scenes, or further developed the ideas he lays forth during the Spanish Inquisition.  But instead he spreads everything too thin.
The Spanish Inquisition scenes could have been great.  Brooks plays a singing-and-dancing Torquemada, resplendent in a plush red robe and a goofy grin.  He dances around the torture chamber, singing one of the film's many fine songs.  It's accompanied by a ridiculous Busby-Berkley-style musical number.  I wanted to see more of Torquemada.  The idea of Brooks, the archetypal Jewish comedian, as the Grand Inquisitor is an idea too good to waste.  Sadly, the film does, in favour of a number of more tepid ideas.
Maybe my eyes, accustomed to more sophisticated comedies in the intervening years, have soured on Brooks schtick.  Or maybe his schtick, as presented here, hasn't aged well.  I'm inclined to believe the second statement is true, and warn you that if it's good Brooks you seek, you can't go wrong with ""The Producers"", ""Young Frankenstein"", or ""Blazing Saddles"".  Don't bother yearning for Brooks' ""History"", lest you're doomed to repeat it.",1025913600,10,5729,5.1054897739504845

The beginning is a bit slow but once you get to the Roman Empire, It's hilarious. Before the Roman Empire, the Moses part is funny and the birth of music is funny, but not as good as the Spanish Inquisition.
  I would recommend this movie to anyone who liked Spaceballs and Robin Hood. If you liked Young Frankenstein, there may be too many jokes and not enough plot. All in all, this was a great movie.",1014854400,2,711,4.071428571428571

366577,5,630179799X,"When you see a title such as this with Mel Brooks the director, you pretty much know what you're getting. And Brooks does not disappoint. He uses the same philosophy as in ""Silent Movie,"" marrying old jokes to veteran actors with hilarious results. It's no different here, whether it's Sid Caesar as a caveman who invents ""rock"" music, Brooks himself as Comicus, a stand-up comic and waiter at the Last Supper in ancient Rome, or Brooks regular Harvey Kormann as Count de Money (""de Monet, de Monet"") in a send up of the the French Revolution, every old joke and routine is resurrected . . . and never fails to keep us laughing.
Besides Kormann and Caesar, Brooks is ably supported by Gregory Hines (his first film, and a great flair for comedy), Madeline Kahn, Dom DeLuise, Shecky Greene, and the great Spike Milligan.
And just when you think it can't get any sillier, along comes Brooks and the Spanish Inquisition in Swingtime, a beautiful parody of MGM musicals.

366579,4,630179799X,"Mel Brooks has tried real hard over the years to be the KING of comedy.  From his early tv appearances (I think it was YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS) to SPACEBALLS and DRACULA: Dead and Loving It; we've gotten a wonderful mixed bag of laughs.  One thing's for certain:  if you walk into the middle of a movie not knowing what it is, just a few minutes of a Brooks film is all it takes and you just know who the crazy man behind it all is!
If you twisted my arm and demanded to know what I think is his crowning achievement I'd choose YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (that's Fron-ken-steen!).  But HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART ONE is also among my favorites of all time.  I'm reduced to tears by the time ""The Spanish Inquisition"" comes to an end.  Count the money...er, De Monet (Harvey Korman) stepping on the red carpeted peasants nearly turns me into a babbling idiot.  Just thinking about when he takes an extra effort to step up on one of them is hilarous!  This was the first Brooks movie I saw in the theater and it has stood the test of time!  The dude with the radio (""...Funkytown!!"") and Caesar's flatulence problem were dang funny to a 15 year old (""Here!  Wash this!"").  Okay!  To a 35 year old too!!
It's fun to pick out all the cameos too:  Bea Arthur, Henny Youngman, John Hurt, etc.

I agree with Leonard Malton on this, and with that other critic on the ""take it or leave it"" aspect.  this is a video you'd want to rent for a laugh because 1) it's Mel Brooks; 2) because it's better than most all TV.

One negative aspect of the movie  is the end scene (""The French Revolution"") does move slower than  the rest of the movie.
