8626040,1,B00CJXYR5A,"I like the story and robot action, but I got a defective set (May 2014 release production). Epsoide 25 and 26 is defective as the sound is shifted from the video action.",1401235200,6,169,4.3125
8626041,1,B00CJXYR5A,"Being a fan of the games, I had waited patiently for this for over a year, as the release date was pushed back a whopping 10 months. I would have hoped they could fix any problems in that time, and would have also preferred my review to be about the series and not the discs. Sadly, that cannot be so.

While the first four discs were fine, as was the first 60% of the fifth. Episode 25 started with scenes from episode 24, and then graduated to having an audio track well removed (I would guess minutes off) from the visuals. This problem remained throughout episodes 25 and 26, and basically made them unwatchable.

While a decent series, anything good I could write about it is more than countered by the fact that, at least with these discs, the finale is so screwed up.",1401235200,8,774,4.368055555555555
