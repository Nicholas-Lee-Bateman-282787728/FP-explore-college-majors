2129357,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Frasier's final year ended this May, and this set collects all of the final episodes of the show. I can't say that this season was the best (or the worst), but it had more than a few standouts and resolved the saga of a character that was 20 years in the making. It's a worthy buy.

Things certainly start out strong: the season opener features Felicity Huffman at her acerbic best as radio newswoman Julia Wilcox. Also, Patrick Stewart makes a guest appearance as an actor with designs on Frasier in ""The Doctor is Out"", the funniest show of the season. Other highlights include an appearance by Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth, fantastic as always), another round of ""Seabee Jeebies"", the sentimental Crock Tales, Laura Linney's guest appearance as a matchmaker who hooks Frasier, and the hilarious (and touching) series finale.

Granted, some of the episodes were less than Emmy-worthy (Freudian Sleep was particularly bad) and some went over the top (Detour) in search of laughs. By and large, though, the result was good, and this set should make a welcome memory for fans of the show.",1098748800,23,1080,4.832432432432433
2129358,5,B0002WZTLQ,"I recently read an article stating that seasons 4-7 will be released next year YAY, I can't wait for them and Season 11 Frasier Rocks",1098748800,13,133,4.36
2129359,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Releasing series one to three then eleven seems illogical to me but I guess they are trying to make as much profit as possible in the pre-Christmas period. There are people worring that the other seasons will be forgotten about, but it's very unlikely that they will be. Frasier has consistently been the most popular sitcom on US television, and there is huge demand for it.

As for season 11, it is one of the best, and there are some classic episodes such as 'The Doctor Is Out' and 'Boo!' I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it, so all I will say is that it's nice to see things wrapped up and come to some sort of conclusion. How the US networks are possibly going to replace Friends and Frasier is beyond me.",1098144000,9,725,4.253623188405797

2129362,2,B0002WZTLQ,"Don't worry.  Paramount will go back and release seasons 4-10 onto DVD.  That's what they said they would do and I believe them. They're releasing the last season onto DVD, because they want to do it while it's still fresh in people's minds.

If it helps, when I heard they were doing this, I wanted to send them a letter saying they're making a big mistake.  But I never did.",1094515200,26,376,4.328571428571428

Yet the show I watched is skipping seasons 4-10 and going straight to the end?  Is this series too unprofitable for NBC to release the rest of the seasons on DVD?

To my shock/horror they've now got the FINAL FRASIER season available, but where are the the seasons after 3 and before the FINAL??? Come on guys, get it together and in order and please make it snappy. It's worse than pulling teeth waiting for our favourite shows to come out on DVD.

2129500,4,B0002WZTLQ,"Although I am posting this review under season 11, my comments apply to all the seasons. Basically I found the series varied from the extremely good to the very poor. It started well in the first four or five season then went to the abysmally poor and picked up with very good episodes in the last season. People in the business tell me that is due to the writers who changed to the detriment of the show along its checked course. Whilst the idea of having brothers both of whom were psychiatrists would work for one season, it really had no longevity especially when the younger brother was to disrupt an already weak storyline by marrying the home help cum physiotherapist and bringing the show to a natural full stop; but the writers preserved and we had four or five seasons of utter doldrums. The ideal set up had been three men and (not a boat) but a dog, with two women (one a homely girl from England) and the other a promiscuous piece from the Diary State. All are excellent actors and deserve full kudos, But that marriage ruins the whole story. The younger brother (David Hyde Pierce) does a wonderful job of morphing into a dominated male and the obsequious maid (Jane Leeves) who had dominated the early seasons has to be almost written out of the play. Some dismal episodes are followed by material which would embarrass a school pantomime; the lesson is to stop while you're winning,",1484438400,,1398,4.573705179282869

The actors are amazing in their interpretation of the scripts, and the writers do a good job of writing Maris out with humor and consideration over a long period of time.

A big part of the show for me is watching two beautiful women wearing clothes that are quite often as beautiful as the women.

2129863,4,B0002WZTLQ,"As with all series television, I'd say that the final season of Frasier was not its best. It inevitably became harder to come up with fresh material as a series goes on, especially when it goes on for eleven seasons! Still, IMHO season 11 of Frasier was still superior to most of network television's offerings.

In fact, some of the final seasons shows ranked up with the best of the series: the episode where Frasier becomes Patrick Stewart's ""boyfriend"", the episode where Martin mistakenly eats Niles' pot brownie and gets high while Niles gets a placebo high from eating a regular brownie, Marris' murder case (several episodes), the episode where Frasier's first wife returns, anxious to resume a physical relationship despite  having remarried, and the episode where Frasier's attempt to scare his father causes his father to have a heart attack (trust me, it's funnier than it sounds).

The last two episodes, ""Goodnight Seattle parts 1&2"" also serve to tie up most loose ends while leaving one thread purposely unresolved.

All in all, ""Frasier"" is classic TV - well written, brilliantly cast, and well acted. It takes a character  who is a rich elitist snob and shows his human side and makes us care for him.",1465948800,2,1219,4.898058252427185

2130330,3,B0002WZTLQ,"I think ""Frasier"" stayed too long at the fair.  I love the show's first 3 or 4 seasons, but, with each passing year, the show becomes more of a parody of itself.  For me, Frasier's bouts of arrogance, selfishness, petty jealousy, and neurotic obsessions become less and less amusing and even his few moments of human kindness are no longer enough to save him from being a distasteful, pompous, self centered man.  It is hard to believe that, through the years, Frasier seems to have learned very little about acting like a grownup.  I will say, 2 things, though:  1) Having known a few psychiatrists and psychologists, I find that there is a certain amount of authenticity in Frasier's manic moments.  I suppose it is the ""physician heal thyself"" factor.  2) The writers did a good job of finishing the show, the final 2 episodes are particularly well done, and Frasier's final line is just right.",1439596800,,897,4.711538461538462

2130546,5,B0002WZTLQ,"We lived in Seattle during much of the time that the series was filmed and it helped make the bad weather tolerable. We love all the seasons, with the development of the characters, with all of their foibles. Some episodes are funnier than others but it's about the only comedy, other than Seinfeld and Hot in Cleveland, than can still actually make me laugh out loud. Most of what passes for comedy these days is just one-liners, mostly cynical. Frasier was one of the last great comedies, the kind which may not see again in our lifetimes. How many spinoffs are actually better than the original they spun from (Cheers)?",1423958400,,622,4.663636363636364

Wendie Malick as Ronee is sheer joy (as always) & I never knew she was so musically talented.  Laurie Metcalf as Nanny G is hysterical (again, as always) & thank heavens we get to see her comedic chops as Sheldon's mother on the The Big Bang Theory!  She needs to be utilized as the star of her own program & not just as a supporting player.

Frasier is without a doubt one of the finest sit-coms EVER, the humor is so sophisticated & bears up well years later.  Such an incredibly talented ensemble cast.  A must-see & one I will enjoy for years to come.",1417824000,,662,4.298387096774194

It is great to see people evolve and having a show for Eleven years you can certainly see how they did.  And to echo what many have already said.

The writing is superb, the acting so well done, and there is the larger story of the development of the characters individually and in relation to  each other within the current predicament of each episode. The timing of entrances and exits to and from scenes is spot on, and we especially enjoy and marvel at how doors are used to accomplish the intent of a scene. Was sad to see the end but 11 seasons was enough for the characters to get on with life. Love it!",1392681600,,512,4.378947368421053
2130726,5,B0002WZTLQ,"The best ones are 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 16, 22 and 23.  The ones with that ""Ann character"" are not good, because she is so annoying.  The last one is too sad.  The ones with ""Charlotte"" are just so-so.  I absolutely love the ones with Martin and Ronee.  She is hysterical.  As is the guy from Star Trek in episode 2. That one is awesome.  High Holidays is a best, also.

I wish this show was still on.  It is one of the best shows ever made.  It's very ""smart"" and not raunchy and crass like the sitcoms of today.  Maybe Kelsey Grammer will resume the role or Frasier again in yet another sitcom.  Wouldn't it be amazing if he could do another 11 or more years as Frasier?!!",1392422400,,668,4.053846153846154
2130727,4,B0002WZTLQ,"I don't believe Season 11 is the strongest of the series (although there are some highlights like 'Nanny G', for example) and the season finale seems anti-climactic, even formulaic, it's still Frasier, which stands above most other series of all time.",1392076800,,251,5.146341463414634

2130734,5,B0002WZTLQ,"I must admit that I never watched this series when it first aired.  However, this past summer I had surgery and was confined to resting.  While looking for something to watch on Netflix, I stumbled upon Fraiser.  I blew through the series within 2 weeks.  I could not stop watching them and before I knew it, I was done.  in my opinion of all of the comedies on TV, this one was the best.  Fraiser is about two brothers and relationships they both endure.  Through these relationships the brothers grow closer.  One cannot help but admire their fashion sense, love of finer things, and their constant desire to do right.  The best show was ""The Doctor is Out"" staring Patrick Stewart who is hilarious as an ""admirer"" of Fraiser.  Season 11 ended with the Fraiser going off to start a new adventure (much like he did when he left Boston and came to Seattle).  Watch all the seasons!!!",1390953600,,883,4.525316455696203
2130735,4,B0002WZTLQ,"The show is called Frasier, yet the ending is not exactly clear whether he is going to be with someone, or just try to be, or take a new job or not.
Also, everyone  in the family gets married and settled but him.
However, the only other thing that is somewhat offputting is the fact that Daphne's personality changes a lot, she is a lot more self centered and not as nice, or charming. But that started before season 11.

All in all however, the scripts are funny and the acting is good, as usual, and it does deserve a 4 star rating.",1390867200,,534,4.174757281553398

That set, alas, ended with Season 8.  I had managed to finish out Season 9 with VHS copies which I horded.  But, as I said, I'd never seen the final two seasons.  This had promised to be a particularly rough Christmas holiday period for me to get through and, I do believe, that if it had not been for these last 2 seasons I would not have made it.  A hearty laugh is the best medicine for anything I guess and I've certainly laughed myself sick over some of these shows. I just wish the show had never ended.

But I recently watched the final season of Frasier and came away firmly convinced that today's writing and acting truly are crappy in comparison.  But if you dip into any episode of Frasier's  final season, you'll discover ensemble comedy at its best. Not a single superfluous character, throw-away line or misstep in delivery. These shows positively crackle with comedic energy and talent. Watch them and have your faith in TV momentarily restored.",1374624000,2,599,5.1020408163265305

However, this season, although it brings the 11-year series to a close, had some memorable moments, fell short of the previous seasons' quality. It was almost like the writers got tired. I am glad they tired up so many loose ends in the series while leaving others open to interpretation. My overall take on the entire series ... watch it if you like Kelsey Grammer and this type of humor but pick and choose the final season's episodes. You'll be happy.",1372982400,,538,4.673684210526316

Any show running this long isn't going to have the same magic in it's eleventh season. But that has as much to do with us as an audience perhaps being used to certain things, or in our expectations, as it does with the writing.  The comedic timing of the cast is as good as ever.

Would've liked a more definitive ending and to have seen Frasier in love for longer, instead of more seeking for love as we'd seen throughout eleven seasons.  Wished for more for Roz, too.

Perhaps those that do not fully appreciate or are aware of the developement of characters throughout the enitre series are the detracters.

2130821,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Having watched all of the seasons of ""Frasier"" in sequence, you can only agree with one of the writers (in one of two excellent but brief specials on the final disc of this final season) that this show is one of the few to not only last this long - but to be delivering the laughs consistently RIGHT TO THE END.

Rather than dilute in quality, some of the episodes on these discs are among the funniest of the series - with a special nod to the fear of clowns episode. Characters whose reputations and quirks we've seen built upon over the years pay off ideas planted seasons ago! It's all good fun!

The special on the last disc, filmed at the shooting of the final episode and interviewing various cast members about both their reflections and their plans, is a wonderful addition to the collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED INDEED!",1224460800,,828,4.550335570469799

2130830,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Like another reviewer, I came late to Frasier,(I also came late to reviewing!) first seeing it in sindication and it was ""love at first show"". I can't remember which episode I saw first, but it was awesome, as they ALL are. Some sitcoms are written brilliantly all the way through and some have episodes that really could have been a lot better. Frasier is consistant throughout. Every episode is as funny and entertaining as the next. David Hyde Pierce as Niles, in my opinion, steals the show every episode even though I love Kelsey Grammar and all his work. I look forward to his new series that starts tonight. (YAY) I do have to say, I won't spoil it episode by episode, but the final one, ""Goodnight Seattle"" is packed full of both comedy and that ""heart tugging"" that's also in so many episodes. Problem is, for me anyway, it's left me wanting more. I want to know what happens next with Frasier and his ""true love"" in Chicago, with Niles' and Daphnie's baby, David - deservingly named for one of the show's creator's David Angell, a true talent and gentleman who with his wife we lost on 9/11/2001. (RIP sweet souls) A major loss to the TV world, especially to Frasier. Anyway, I HOPE that in the future the show comes back and continues on, although I don't see it happening. I'm certain that there are many besides me who hold that tiny shread of hope anyway. If you don't have the Frasier collection, you're missing out on some wonderful, light hearted comedy and characters that you can not only relate to, but fall in love with. (RIP ""Moose"" who played Martin's dog, Eddie - Your doggie antics gave us many laughs throughout the show as well.) I highly antisipate completing my collection in December with the long overdue release of Season 10.",1190073600,5,1757,4.598726114649682

2130833,5,B0002WZTLQ,"""Frasier"" remains one of the most best-acted and literate shows to ever air on the small screen.  With the pivotal cast of Kelsey Grammer (""Frasier""), David Hyde Pierce (""Niles""), Jane Leeves (""Daphne""), Peri Gilpin (""Roz""), John Mahoney (""Martin""), and the irreplaceable Moose and Onzo (""Eddie""), the show was never condescending to the audience, requiring that viewers step up to the plate to enjoy some of the wittiest repartee to be found in the history of television.  Of course, the show had its share of truly funny sight gags but these never overshadowed the delicious dialog and, for that, the excellent writing staff received well-earned honors in the forms of its numerous Emmys and Golden Globes.

This eleventh and final season has to be considered one of its best, not only in resolving character issues but in overall humor.  The writing staff and the cast were magnificent, dolling out consistently funny and poignant tales.  When other shows resulted in ""stunt casting"" to boost ratings, ""Frasier's"" roster of guest performers were the best for the part and elevated the show to a level that others only wish they could attain.  Patrick Stewart, Laura Linney, Aaron Eckhart, Julia Sweeney, Felicity Huffman, Penny Johnson, Jennifer Tilly, Laurie Metcalf, Estelle Parsons, and Rosie Perez were just some of the talented guest stars that popped into the life of the fictional Seattle radio psychologist.

And the show would not be complete without the return of recurring characters Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth), Kenny (Tom McGowan), Bebe (Harriet Sansom Evans), Simon (Anthony LaPaglia), Wendie Malick (Ronnie), Bulldog (Dan Butler), Gil (Edward Hibbert), and Frasier's son Frederick (Trevor Einhorn).

There is nary a bad show in the bunch and this is indeed a necessary purchase for those that enjoy comedy that is timeless, thought-provoking, and perfectly acted.

The bonus features are equally as well done, providing some closure to a character, that began on ""Cheers"", that became a television staple for twenty years.

""Dr. Frasier Crane"" will be sorely missed!",1184716800,62,2079,5.2727272727272725
2130834,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Frasier fan?  Buy it.  Sort of a Frasier fan?  You probably should still buy it.  Personally I thought season 8 and 9 were the ""slowest"" seasons, though they are all very much worthwhile to own for any true-blue Frasier fan, and still better than most television that I've watched in the last 30 years.  But Season 11 IS very good.

However, I agree with others on the release of season 11 so early...and there's more.  As of this review's date, every season is available but season 10.  This is very frustrating because <spoiler -- if you're waiting to see season 9 and really don't know much about the story line, don't read the rest of this paragraph > at the very last episode of season 9 we see Daphne tell Niles she wants to get married...immediately.  Off they go and...that's it, leave it to you're imagination because there's no season 10 yet!  Another budding story line that I waited the first 9 years to see was Frasier and Roz, where, ahem, stuff happens near the end of season 9, and then...sorry, no season 10.  You'll just have to wait.  But you CAN  jump to season 11.  And what do we get but the first episode (No Sex Please, We're Skittish) is part 2 of a two-parter, of which part 1 is apparently the last episode of currently-unavailable season 10!  What a bonehead move.  Worse, this episode involves said matter involving Fraze and Roz, which to me makes it a must see in its entirety.  Who knows, maybe they mixed up just my set, but I doubt it.

I, and most people out there I think, try to be mature, and understand business, and marketing, and merchandising, but it's precisely this kind of bizarre tactic by Paramount/CBS Video that has turned me off television.  Seriously...I have no TV or cable in my home anymore.  That's why I bought Frasier.  If the SuperBowl is on, I connect up the yagi, otherwise, it's just DVD's that I own, and I -- I'm not just saying this -- I don't miss it.  Truly.  Your mind clears up.  But I digress.  After years of working in customer service, I am just stunned at the stupidity that oils the television machine.  If any other business operated this way, they would be out of business.

If anyone out there works for Paramount/CBS Video, fill us in so that we know you aren't all certified morons.  Strangely, the major networks don't get it.  They wonder why Neilson ratings show people tuning-out in droves, thinking that the 45 year old rating system is at fault.  Any real-life Frasier's out there like to take a stab at diagnosing that one?  I think the term is  ""cognitive dissonance"" -- sometimes referred to as denial.  Sorry for the editorial, but if we all want more Frasier quality TV, we gotta speak up.

Back to the review.

I have watched, and recommend watching, ep's 1 thru 9 in order, as there are references to characters and plots from earlier episodes that will cause you to miss the full importance or the humour behind the dialogue.  Like so many other fans, I couldn't always catch Frasier episodes in order during it's run, and it was quite a revelation to see them in order for the first time.  I think this is why many new Frasier fans didn't watch when it was on, as there's too much to become familiar with when watching episodes piece-meal.

Just one more thing...there's very few extras included in the whole series of DVD's, and no subtitles, somewhat unfortunate because of the almost literal Byzantine references that are made in certain jokes.  The actors do a great job of annunciation, but sometimes it would be nice to see the lines that are being spoken.  It's hard to sound-out Golda Meir.",1180915200,6,3592,4.5515625

I couldn't wait to see the final episode, but I'll wait until the other two are out.  By the way, I could tell when the original writers had left.  Season 7 was the end of an era, although there were still some funny moments.  Season eight just seemed to lack the originality and also there seemed to be a change in the actor's demeanor.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it was definitely there.  A Day in May was just weird and out-of-place.  Maybe it was the lack of canned laughter in the park.  Niles and Daphne seemed to have to work on their ""in-love"" moments.",1154649600,11,865,4.150602409638554
2130841,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Recapturing at least some of the magic of the first seven seasons, ""Frasier"" goes out in a blaze of glory with this final, wonderful 23 episode season.

Not hard to believe since some of ""Frasier's"" best writers come back into the fold like Joe Keenan with his contrabution, ""The Doctor is Out"".  An instant classic in the mold of the second season farce, ""The Matchmaker"", this one has a great performance by Patrick Stewart and begs the question ""would you change your lifestyle for three weeks on Capri in Bertalluci's villa?""

Other delights include the return of Maris in a very funny two parter (""Maris Returns"" & ""Murder Most Maris"") along with ""Boo!"" when Frasier, tired of being scared by his father, manages to spook Martin to the point of a ""cardiac event"" (wearing a very creepy and disturbing clown makeup & suit).  ""Caught in the Act"" brings back ""Nanny G"", Frasier's first wife (as seen previously in a ""Cheers"" episode) played by a very randy Laurie Metcalf.

""Match Game"" introduces Laura Linney who goes on to become Frasier's love. And the awesome finale ""Goodnight Seattle"" which brings back the wonderful Anthony Lapaglia as Daphne's wayward brother Simon along with Frasier's agent, Bebe. Oh, and Daphne & Niles have a baby, too.

Not every episode is a gem, however.  The ones with Lilith (Guns 'n Neuroses) and Frederick (High Holidays) falls a bit flat. As well as the final outing of the KACL staff in ""Frasier Lite"". ""Freudian Sleep"" ventures into the dreams of the characters which seems very similar to another, better episode from 3rd Rock From The Sun's 3-D spectacular ""Nightmare on Dick Street"".

""Crock Tales"", a very ambitious episode where Frasier remembers events from the previous 11 years is nearly derailed by some of the terrible wigs/hairpieces that Jane Leeves, Peri Gilpin, & David Hyde Pierce had to wear.

But these are minor nits, especially when compared to the previous three seasons when ""Frasier"" certainly lost some of its edge.

This DVD collection includes two ""specials"" which document the final episodes of ""Frasier"" and include interviews with cast & the writing staff.  They are somewhat short, but interesting.  It would've been nice to include the special ""Analyzing the Laughter"" which ran before the final episode ""Goodnight Seattle"", but given the lack of extras on the DVD sets since season 4, I shouldn't complain too much...well, maybe a little.

It was certainly great that ""Frasier"" managed to go out on a high note and this DVD set does a wonderful job of presenting
the final season of one of the great sitcoms of all time.

Tidbits:
- I love the promo photos used on the DVD box cover and insides (the one on the back with Kelsey, David, & John fawning on Jane Leeves is very warm & funny).  But it's interesting to note that the inside photo of David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, & John Mahoney together is clearly reversed, you can tell by the parts in their hair.

- Martin's dream in ""Freudian Sleep"" has John Mahoney dancing without a cane, one of the few if only times we see his character fully mobile.

- Do you remember the original ""Nanny G"" from ""Cheers""? That was Emma Thompson.

- Rosie Perez makes an appearence in ""Crock Tales"", she was one of the candidates for the physical therapist role until Jane Leeves was picked.  Also, she ""phoned in"" a performance in the second season classic ""Roz in the Doghouse"".

- In ""Goodnight Seattle"", most of the patrons watching Frasier's final radio broadcast from the hallway are the writing staff of the show.

- I still have the original airing of ""Goodnight Seattle"" on tape which has no ""official"" end credits (just the tiny ones used during a commercial break).  On the DVD, we get the ""Thanks for Calling"" and publicity photos which includes Helen Mirren, the very LAST caller of the Frasier series.",1152316800,40,3827,4.801829268292683
2130842,5,B0002WZTLQ,"This may have been how the show was aired in the US, but 23 minutes into the final episode there is a cut of about 10 seconds, a joke which was shown in the UK.  It's a slightly smutty line about the ice sculpture - the set-up line is still there a few minutes before this.

How many other lines are missing?",1110758400,12,308,3.9516129032258065
2130843,4,B0002WZTLQ,"Even though I was. I got hooked on Frasier on the reruns so when Season One was announced on dvd I jumped at it. I love to see how a series unfolds from the beginning. After that, I've bought Seasons 2, 3, and 4. I saw this final season ""used"" at a game store for a VERY reasonable price, and yet I almost balked. I mean, would the show be funny 7 years in between Season 4 and this Final 11? The answer is yes. Yes! YES! The show is as good as any of the others I have and while I am saddened to jump so far ahead in the time line and lose a lot of continuity I know in time 5-10 will be there to fill in the blanks. Remarkably they almost all LOOK like they did from Season 4, the wonders of modern day make up I guess.

I definately suggest buying this for the quality and the simple fact that by the time Season 10 is released I would imagine this Season (11) may be hard to find by then, I mean I think that will be sometime from now, perhaps two years or more and often dvds become hard to track down years after release.",1110067200,4,1027,3.867298578199052

The show had seemed to have lost its edge in the later seasons and other things seemed to take priority whatever night it was airing.  I recently saw some of the final season episodes in late night syndication and something struck me THESE EPISODES ARE GREAT!  The great writing is there with too many laugh out loud moments to count.  Some of the embarasing farcial moments are there but without the contrived feel that had creeped into such plot twists in recent years.  The focus is on the characters and how their relationships continue to evolve.  We've lived with these characters for over a decade and it was sad to see it end.  There seems to be a huge vacuum in the tv world for well written character driven comedy.  I hope another show can come along to fill that void.  Hello Hollywood, read my lips (or at least my digital musings) Frasier -- the movie.  No made for tv cheapie but a big screen monster.

CHEERS' fourth season is on its way to stores where DVD's are sold. It was only eight months ago that NBC aired the series finale of FRASIER. At that time,NBC pulled the plug on the ten-year run of FRIENDS as well. For the rest of his life,Kelsey Grammer will be called Frasier occasionally,if not frequently,no matter where he is.

Also, this season was shot in widescreen 16:9 ratio aspect if I recall. Yet this set is in full frame 1.33:1 ratio aspect.

Blatant commercialism triumphs over customer service again.  Having purchased the first three series, I will now show my disapproval in the only way consumers can; with my wallet.  I will spend not another dime on Frasier DVD's.  It's ironic that here in Asia we are now subjected to ads encouraging us to boycott pirate DVD's and how it's morally wrong to purchase them (US TV sells for about $18 per series on DVD).  Paramount should be aware that loyalty is a two way street; companies who abuse consumers in this way will ultimately lose.",1101081600,9,691,4.669421487603306
2130850,4,B0002WZTLQ,"First of all, I would like to say that I came late to the Frasier game. I started watching it after syndication.  What always impressed me about Frasier is that the show seemed to have hit the ground running.  Most TV shows need to warm up in the first season before they get really good, but Frasier was excellent from the very first episode.  I was rarely able to catch the show during its normal time slot and when it wasn't being shown on the other channels as much, I stopped watching.

However, I was able to get a hold of Seasons 1 - 3 on DVD and fell in love with the show again.  And I have now seen the shows of this final season (which I never saw when they first aired).  The shows of this season were great and I found myself cracking up like I did when watching the older episodes.  Episodes that stood out for me were ""Murder Most Maris"", ""High Holidays"", ""Boo!"", ""The Doctor is Out"", ""Maris Returns"", ""No Sex Please, We're Skittish"", and ""Caught in the Act"".  However, I found something was lacking here that I had seen in the earlier episodes.  I can't put my finger on it, but it seemed that the show had fallen into a rut. You could tell that there are only so many ideas that TV writers could come up with.  It was a wise move to end the series now before it got stale and unwatchable.  I'm sure many probably think that the show by season 11 was already unwatchable, but I disagree.

In my opinion, Season 11 is definitely not Frasier's best, but it's pretty darn good and it provides excellent closure for all of the characters.  It's definitely a season that every Frasier fan should see and own.  However, I am more anxious for Seasons 4 - 7 to be released.  I'm rather mystified by Paramount's decision to release the final season now and keep us waiting for older shows that many consider to be better than more recent episodes.

And for those you who don't already know, Paramount will be releasing the other season at an accelerated pace with Season 4 being released in early 2005.  So, be patient, it will be here before you know.  However, I think season 11 is entertaining enough to pass the time until that happens.  But, I can't help but feel that Seasons 1 - 3 are a bit better.",1100736000,62,2212,4.312348668280872
2130851,1,B0002WZTLQ,"Frasier lost its way in the last few seasons, sadly, and I find only a few episodes of this set even watchable. The Julia character grates on my nerves big time, despite the best efforts of Felicity Huffman. (I'm glad she found a series that better uses her talents, or is successful at least!) And I never could accept Martin and the acerbic lounge singer, Ronee, as a couple. Ugh!

The only thing the writers did right was to jettison Julia and bring in Laura Linney, who was believable and wonderful. Even so, the writers managed to come up with a few dreadful episodes featuring her character, such as the one where she and Frasier go on a road trip and end up spending the night with a creepy family. Another painfully bad episode is the one where all the characters have horrible dreams. I'll be fast-forwarding through those two!

Another reviewer here commented that even the worst episode of Frasier beats any episode of any other series, and after trying out Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development, I would say that's true! But I will wait for Season 4 to finally be released. Classic Frasier: a thing of beauty!",1100649600,16,1129,4.64
2130852,5,B0002WZTLQ,"Ok - I admit it - I'm an absolute Frasier addict and have even gone so far as to introduce family members and friends to the DVDs of the first three seasons, thereby ensuring their addiction as well.

BUT WHERE THE HECK ARE SEASONS 4 - 10??

""Ham Radio"" (from the fourth season) is, without question, the 30 funniest minutes of TV I have ever seen.  Ever!  And there's an episode in the sixth season - I believe the title is ""Merry Christmas Mrs. Feingold"" which comes in a very close second.

More seasons.  Please.  Quickly.",1100131200,15,526,4.416666666666667
2130853,1,B0002WZTLQ,"Releasing the final season of Frasier before the previous seasons shows just how stupid these losers are.

Don't buy this season until the others are released so Paramount will wake up!!

This move is the proof that idiots are running rampant on the planet.

There are people who haven't seen all the episodes between season 4 & the last season. Who the hell wants to see the end before all the intervening episodes.

Why don't they just start releasing the last 10 minutes of all their products. All that useless substance in the middle isn't worth the time.

Please e-mail the loser idiots at Paramount & tell them they suck.",1099872000,34,627,4.663636363636364
