6447688,5,B00KU3Y40O,"Personally I never cared that much of STING so I can't give a honest review of this. I did watch almost the whole thing and some of the matches were great. The reason why I gave this 5 stars is due to the quality. WWE managed to get some old matches of STING and put them out there in fantastic quality.
Now from what I seen there is not Doc which was a real big bummer. STING does speak a few times in between matches though and talks about the individual match. Not all of them but I would say about half of them.. I was hoping for more of a Documentary but I think WWE will do that AFTER Sting wrestles his last match in WWE.
If you are a die hard STING fan then you will absolutely love this DVD though",1407283200,,706,3.944055944055944

Overall: This may very well be the best Sting DVD to ever be released. Although TNA put out a few great DVDs on the Man They Call Sting, this one will overshadow them all. This DVD is jam-packed with literally every one of Sting's greatest matches and feuds from WCW. I am slightly disappointed that there's no mention of his feud with Vampiro in here though. WWE went above and beyond to cover every portion of Sting's career---which they deserve a gold star for. From his pre-Sting days as Blade Runner Flash; to his Surfer gimmick that he used from the late 80s to the mid 90s; to his legendary Crow gimmick that took WCW by storm throughout 1997 to his short stint in NWO Wolfpac, this set covers it all. No matter when you began following the career of Sting; be it 80s or 90s, this is truly an ultimate set that is a must-have for any Sting fan. The only thing that would've raised the pedestal that this DVD is already on, is a documentary portion from Sting himself. But seeing as how Sting is currently a part of WWE, I doubt this will be the last Sting DVD we see",1406851200,18,5145,4.6598870056497175

Thanks to [...] for the list as always. I'm pretty stunned with the set.

The Starrcade match is shown (Hogan's hendrix theme is dubbed over by something else)...and that's it! Missing is Sting breaking his silence on Thunder and the rematch at SuperBrawl.

An early Flair match but gets cut off?  How about the 45 minute time limit draw against Flair that put him on the map?  What about the Iron Man tournament?  Stan Lane?  Dutch Mantel?  All the DQs?  Sting had many memorable matches against the Great Muta and Big Van Vader and they picked probably the worst of both.  Where is Lex Luger?  I still got excited watching Sting win his first World Title, but they showed no title defenses?  Man, this could of been so much better with Sting's great career.",1432857600,,649,4.452991452991453

6447744,3,B00KU3Y40O,"First and foremost there is no new commentary from Sting himself, there is however footage of a Sting interview from WCW sliced in throughout the set. I feel like this DVD would have worked fine as an Evolution Of Sting compilation, however as a ""best of"" it falls way short of that title. The first disc is by far the strongest, I found the matches ranged from solid to good. The second disc starts off strong but the quality of the matches dropped off rather quickly. The third disc is easily the worst, I think only 2 matches have an undisputed outcome and nothing is really ""great"" on it. In a  lot of ways the third disc illustrates in a nutshell what went wrong with WCW from Starrcade 1997 onwards.

I would recommend this DVD if you are a hardcore Sting fan but if you prefer quality over quantity, this DVD probably won't be what your looking for.",1424822400,,856,4.4113924050632916

I could go on but your are probably already sick of reading my tirade so I will stop.

I would have loved to see more focus on his early career and some highlighting of major storylines.  Sting and the 4 Horsemen.  The Angel of Death storyline.  This DVD set had to be years in the making and it radically underdelivered. They even put the fake Sting on the back of the DVD....it just seems like WWE put very, very little into this and, while it is great to have some of these matches(Sting/Muta vs the Steiners was one of my favorites), more than a few are throw away matches.

Quite disappointed in what could have been a great product.",1413158400,5,792,4.489510489510489
6447768,5,B00KU3Y40O,"If you wanted to get technical about it, this is not Steve Borden's (a.k.a. Sting) first venture into the realm of wrestling DVDs. TNA wrestling produced a nice documentary that had some good matches on it--but as I'm sure longtime Sting fans (or wrestling fans in general) will tell you; what we waited years for was a DVD covering his career in the now defunct NWA/WCW--which is where Sting made his legacy and became one of the all-time greats.

So--after who knows how many years of clamoring--WWE finally authorized a Sting collection; and how did they do? Well--for the most part--I would say they got it right. It's too bad Sting himself didn't film an all new interview for the docu-style features in between the matches--but the clips that are used are good enough and most of the matches hold up remarkably well.

Of course, the big highlight from Disc 1 for me was the Sting/Flair Great American Bash 1990 match for the NWA World Title. Perhaps my all-time favorite of the many Sting/Flair matches--although I would not argue with those people who would go with their time limit draw from the '88 Clash of Champions.

Going through the material presented here, I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't delve further into the Sting/Big Van Vader rivalry. Where's Sting vs. Vader from the '92 Great American Bash--I mean the whole match, not just clips. Or how about Sting's feud with Rick Rude?

Part of what seems like the fun with these WWE wrestler collections is griping about the matches WWE chose to include--or in this case--not include on the DVDs. A few that jump to my mind--Sting vs. Flair on the old WCW Saturday Night Program that aired in August of 1993. I don't remember the exact date--but I do remember Sting and Flair went to the 40 minute limit again and, of course, delivered a classic match for the NWA World Title.

Another World Title Match that I was sure would make a ""Best of Sting"" DVD would have been the classic that Sting and Diamond Dallas Page had on March 23, 1998. The thing that would've made that match refreshing for this collection is that it was one of the rare Monday Nitro matches that was free of any NWO run-ins and had a clean finish--imagine that. And given WWE's efforts to all but eliminate that Sting/DDP match from youtube, I'm pretty shocked it didn't find its way to DVD.

Oh well, maybe it will be included on a future Sting DVD release. If the Undertaker, Bret Hart, Ric Flair and countless other wrestlers can have multiple DVD releases made for them, then certainly a legend like Sting will be afforded the same courtesy.

Disc 3 focuses on Sting's evolution from the blonde haired, multi-colored surfer to ""the Crow."" Perhaps WWE could have delved into this a bit more, as they jump from Sting's debut in the black and white face paint from October 1996 all the way to Starrcade '97.

And fans of wrestling know the story behind Starrcade and what an epic fail that match was, so I won't go into it. I'll just say Sting and Hogan from Superbrawl 8 may have been a better match to showcase. Some bonus features of Sting in the rafters or dropping down from the ceiling would have been nice too.

It's easy to focus on the negatives and what WWE did or didn't put on this collection--but overall, if you're a longtime Sting fan like me, then I'm sure you'll be satisfied with this DVD. And as I said before, I'm sure there's more to come in the future--including what I hope will be a new Sting documentary feature that will have an interview with Steve Borden himself.

But--until that day comes--I will enjoy ""The Best of Sting.""

I could only imagine this is why they didn't put the vast majority of his career-defining and memorable matches on this set. The only 2 PPV matches are the GAB '90 vs Flair and Starrcade '97 against Hogan. The rest are filler matches. Also, thanks WWE for reminding me just how God Awful WCW became towards the end.

The testimonials were interesting, but so much more could have been said for Sting. It's a must have for any Sting fan, but I'll hopefully recommend the next one, if it happens.",1412726400,2,670,4.630252100840337

Rare match of Sting before he hit it big. Nice way to start the set off

Sting & Rick Steiner vs. Mike Rotundo & Ron Simmons
NWA Southern Pro Wrestling

Rick Steiner before he became ""The Dog Faced Gremlin"" with that dorky looking helmet lol. Enjoyed it.

Sting vs Flair - NWA Title
NWA Pro Wrestling

Oh yeah. Anytime Sting and Flair face each other, it's a classic. The only exception, if there is one: their match on TNA Impact Wrestling a few years back.

Sting vs. Stan Lane
Main Event

Stan Lane was really something in his day. Sting was just continuing his rise to the top. Combine those two elements together and you get a good match here.

Sting vs. Butch Reed
Main Event

Haven't seen much of Butch Reed. But he must have been known as The Natural for a reason. This match proved to me why he was called that.

Sting vs. Mike Rotundo - NWA TV Title
WCW World Championship Wrestling

I liked this one. Sting and the future I.R.S. had good matches together.

Sting vs. Ron Simmons
WCW Power Hour

Ron Simmons, the first ever African American World Champion and the future Icon, Sting. For a TV match, this was good.

Sting vs. Great Muta - NWA TV Title
WCW Power Hour

All hail The Great Muta! Always wondered why WWE never released a set on him. I enjoyed anytime these two got together. No exception here.

Sting vs Flair - NWA Title
Great American Bash 1990

Yet another Sting/Flair match and a damn good one.

Sting vs. Dutch Mantel
Main Event

""Dirty"" Dutch Manel a.k.a. Uncle ZEBekiah and now, ZEB Colter! I thought this was good.

Sting vs. Nikita Koloff
Clash of the Champions XIV

For the most part, Clash Of The Champions was some of WCW's best stuff. I am not familiar with Koloff. But I am very familiar with Sting. I watched this one twice because it brought my attention to Nikita.

Sting & The Great Muta vs. The Steiner Brothers
WCW/New Japan Supershow II

a young Sting and The Great Muta....a dream team going against one of the best tag teams in the business, The Steiner Brothers. That's a recipe for a great tag team bout!

Sting vs. Vader - Bounty match
WCW WorldWide

Vader was one of Sting's best rivalries and vice versa. This was good. But I wish they included their Starrcade match too.

Sting, Barry Windham, Ricky Steamboat & Dustin Rhodes vs. Rick Rude, Bobby Eaton, Larry Zbyszko, Arn Anderson (The Dangerous Alliance)
WCW World Championship Wrestling

Nice 8 man tag!

Sting vs. DDP
WCW Saturday Night

Good, but nowhere near their match(es) on Nitro, which I wish was a part of this set.

Sting vs. Barry Windham
WCW Saturday Night

Barry Windham was misused in WWE. So to WWE fans, he was no big deal. Those who saw him during this time of WCW know how talented he is. This was a great match for WCW Saturday Night!

Sting vs. Stunning Steve Austin
WCW Pro Wrestling

I've heard Austin recently talk about how he worked with Sting back in the day and enjoyed it. Watching this match, I can see why he feels that way.

Viewers Choice Match
Sting vs. Ric Flair
WCW Nitro

This is the match the fans picked for the inaugural episode of Nitro. No surprise there. I don't think any match these two had since the Great American Bash were as good as that match was. But for a TV bout, this was very enjoyable. Ironically this match would close out Nitro years later in March 2001 when WCW went out of business.

Sting vs. Arn Anderson
WCW Nitro

Double A was a hell of a talent in his prime. I wish his career was not cut short. He's had better matches that WWE refuses to put on a set. But if you haven't seen his work, this isn't a bad pace to start.

Sting and Randy Savage vs Nasty Boys
WCW Saturday Night

Great tag team match here.

Sting Becomes Free Agent
WCW Nitro

""That right there is your cheap imitation. You get what you paid for don'cha? The real Sting may or may not be in your price range. But the only thing that's for sure about Stingis nothing's for sure."" The last words spoken by Sting in October 21, 1996 till he broke his silence on Thunder when he had to vacate the WCW Title after winning it at Starrcade 97. Tony kept getting it wrong saying he hasn't said a word since September.

Sting vs Hogan - WCW Title
Starrcade 97

In terms of the build and story, the best WCW had, at least since Nitro began. This was the period WCW beat WWE in the ratings every week. And what did Sting get in return? A screwjob controversial ending and having to vacate the Title on Thunder. The ending to Starrcade 97 as far as I'm concerned began the downfall of WCW due to backstage politics.

Sting and Luger vs Hogan and Savage
WCW Nitro

Thanks to Sting and Randy Savage, this was okay. Hogan nor Luger were the greatest wrestlers in the world.

Sting vs. Kevin Nash
WCW Nitro

Sting was good as always. This was one of Nash's better matches of his career.

Sting vs. Scott Steiner
WCW Thunder

I was never a fan of Scott Steiner during his Big Poppa Pump days. He was pumped up all right. Pumped up on steroids. And this is who Sting was stuck in the ring with. To his credit, he handled it like a grade A+ class act pro.

Sting and Nash vs Harlem Heat
WCW Nitro

Harlem Heat, one of WCW's beat tag teams. And why not? They are real life brothers. You won't find a better tag team than a well oiled, well established brother combination. Nice bout here.

Sting and Warrior vs. Bret Hart and Hogan
WCW Nitro

Did what it needed to do, I suppose: further things for Halloween Havoc 98 where the God awfully atrocious Warrior vs Hogan II and the great Sting vs Bret Hart matches took place.

Sting vs. Bret Hart
WCW Nitro

Great match. IMO, their Halloween Havoc match was just as good if not better..

Sting vs Savage
WCW Nitro

I enjoyed the chemistry between these two. Two of the all time greats one on one on TV. Can you ask for anymore?

Sting vs Booker T - WCW Title
WCW Nitro

Sting and Booker T, two of WCW's top level talent against each other in a nice TV match.

Sting vs Jeff Jarrett - #1 Contender's Best 2 Out Of 3 Falls match
WCW Thunder

Awesome PPV-like (considering the stipulation and type of match) for TV. Sting talked Jarrett into making this a #1 Contender's match with the winner facing the WCW Champion no matter who that was.

Sting, Booker T & Goldberg vs. Jeff Jarrett & KroniK
WCW Thunder * October 25, 2000

This could have easily been replaced and should have been. I'm not saying it wasn't good. But Sting's had better matches and this is supposed to be a Best Of collection.

Sting vs. Ric Flair
WCW Nitro * March 26, 2001

Fitting way to end the set.

For the most part, the bluray exclusive promos are nice. The Robocop vignette was not necessary. I like many others are trying to forget that. A worthy replacement would have been the two Sting's and The Steiner Brothers in the ring together where Sting hits the Deathdrop on the fake Sting or The Sting Army saving Piper from a nWo attack.

I remember Sting joining the Wolfpac very well and surprised when I first saw that back in 1998.

Not bad. But to be honest, Bash At The Beach 1992, Sting vs Cactus Jack, Falls Count Anywhere would've been a better fit for this set.

Sting and Luger vs Jim Neidhart and DaveyBoy Smith
WCW Nitro

Not a bad match here. But man, I really wanted to see Sting vs DDP on Nitro here as that was one of Sting's best matches ever.

Sting's Final Promo in WCW
WCW Nitro

Nice inclusion. But this shouldn't be a blurry exclusive. It should have been part of the main feature where the promo leads to the actual match.

Overall, nice set. If you're a Sting fan, get it and enjoy watching it. I believe WWE purposely left off some of Sting's great matches in order for this collection to serve as a preview of sorts for a Sting documentary, which I guess will be released around his HOF induction much like Warrior's set was released around his HOF induction. If WWE end up not releasing a Sting documentary set which they should as the anticipation for the set will guarantee an immediate sellout, I can see them doing a Sting special for the WWE Network, which would include a documentary like they did for Warrior.",1412035200,8,9225,4.436309523809523
6447776,4,B00KU3Y40O,The Dvd was good.  I can't wait for Sting to do a new documentary.  But we will see.,1411862400,,84,3.611111111111111
6447777,1,B00KU3Y40O,No biography??? I had really hoped for a nice in-depth bio of the man and the character. This will most likely have a few little bits of Sting talking in-between the featured matches. Poor form WWE.,1411862400,3,198,4.527777777777778
6447778,5,B00KU3Y40O,"This is a excellent WWE release, especially on Blu Ray. The picture quality on the early matches are amazing, especially for being close to 30 years old. WWE did a great job of cleaning up the old video tapes.

You also get a lot of great Blu ray exclusive matches and segments that are not on the dvd.

My only concern is Amazon price for this set. I bought this Blu Ray today (9/24/14) from Best Buy for $22.99. No reason to pay $34.99 for this release, this is the highest price I have ever seen for a WWE release. Very perplexing price point!!

In the long run you get hours upon hours of great Sting matches here. Just try to get the best price and don't always believe the hype that Amazon has the lowest prices. I highly recommend this to any old school wrestling fans.",1411516800,13,776,4.26530612244898
6447779,5,B00KU3Y40O,"I just picked this up and watched a big chunk of it. While others are cutting and pasting from WWE websites to give you the contents I wanted to give you the perspective of an owner/viewer.  The listings of the others are correct and there is a ton of stuff here.... the GOOD NEWS... is that WWE tries to make this something of an autobiographical production.  Without new STING interviews , what they do as links is present new interviews with folks like Hulk Hogan  who goes back to 84 knowing him as a weight lifter in CA.  They also are repurposing the autobiographical interviews STING did for WCW on some home view VHS tapes in the mid 90's so STING is also speaking on camera about his career... without his participation this is the best one could hope for so it's more than just 8 hours of matches strung together. They also (on the BR) have loads of promos.... so it's really the definitive STING item for the time being.  There is a cool best of Sting DVD from the promotion he's been with since WCW and another sort of bio movie as well that would make your STING collection inclusive.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for old school wrestling buffs. Of interest to fans of the Ultimate Warrior in particular would be the plentiful early footage of the two of them as the Blade Runners etc... both in promo and in ring action.",1411430400,3,1325,4.454545454545454
6447780,3,B00KU3Y40O,"This DVD was years in the making since WWE wanted to make a Sting collection even when he was in TNA and had one scheduled for release until they cancelled it. Now that it's finally been released it doesn't disappoint; well not completely anyway. WWE still isn't spectacular at picking out what matches to use. Since many of the matches end by count out or DQ like with the Mr. Perfect and Macho Man dvds.
  Sting had many good matches with Vader, Arn Anderson, The Great Muta and Steve Austin. So typically they chose the ones that would be better if someone won by pin fall or submission.
  Plus did we really need Sting vs Stan Lane/Zeb Colter on the DVD just to show us Zeb used to be a wrestler ? Here's matches that would have made the DVD more solid. Sting vs Sid at Halloween Havoc, Sting vs Luger at SuperBrawl 2, vs Jake the Snake at Halloween Havoc, vs Cactus Jack in an I Quit Match, any match where Sting beat Rude ""just not the Spring Stampede one where Rude lost due to an extremely weak chair shot by Harley Race"", Sting vs Vader in a King of Cable match, vs Steve Austin (04/08/95) ""instead of the DQ ending match they used"", vs Hulk Hogan on Nitro (1995) ""only DQ ending match I wouldn't have minded"", Sting vs Kensuke Sasake at Starcade 1995, Sting vs Lord Steven Regal at Great American Bash, Crow Sting vs DDP on Nitro (WCW title) ""instead of Sting vs DDP that is on the DVD"", Sting (Champion) vs Scott Hall, Wolf Pack Sting vs the Giant, heel Sting (Champion) vs Bret Hart on Nitro, vs Luger at Uncensored, vs Vampiro first time ever, vs Great Muta and Vampiro at Fall Brawl. All the mentioned are better than the DQ matches they included.
  Updated: My opinion after watching all of it.: The first disc has a nice list of his earlier matches. The matches with Flair and Mike Rotunda were well chosen but they dropped the ball with his matches vs Muta, vs Austin and Vader. Not to mention that a one on one match with Rude should have been included and with Sid as I mentioned.
  The second disc mostly sucks. You have Sting and Luger vs Hollywood Hogan and Savage "" DQ ending"", Sting vs Nash on Nitro ""DQ ending"", Sting vs Scott Steiner on Thunder ""DQ ending"", Sting brawling all over the arena with Bret which wasn't even really a match, Sting vs Savage ""DQ ending"". I know Nitro had many DQ endings but for someone with a good memory I know there's plenty of better Crow Sting matches where he actually pinned someone. So no way is most of this ""the Best"" of Sting.
  Sting vs Hollywood Hogan at Starcade sucked due to Hogan having to look like he was ripped off. Rather than giving Sting the clean win. Any of their matches but that one are better. So the strongest matches on the second disc are Sting vs Booker T, Sting and Nash vs Harlem Heat, Sting vs Jarrett and Sting vs Flair.
  I know I started with a four star rating but after getting through the whole collection I am pretty disappointed. Only about 40% of the matches chosen are the best of Sting. Yes, WWE always gets the documentaries right but if I wanted to just see the documentary I would have waited until it was on the WWE Network.",1411430400,25,3127,4.335616438356165
6447781,4,B00KU3Y40O,"He's gone by a bunch of names throughout his career from ""The Stinger"" to ""The Franchise of WCW"" to ""The Icon"" and also has the rare distinction of being one of the only men to not only have wrestled for WCW throughout it's entire time as a wrestling promotion but also to have never (as of the time of this review & DVD release) wrestled for WWE...that man is Steve Borden but he's better known as Sting. Now it should be noted that it's been reported that this DVD set was in the process of being put together before Sting officially started having his current working relationship with WWE so it's strictly a match anthology & you will not hear from new interview footage him throughout this presentation but you will see past interview footage from him (an ""Up Close"" personality profile in 1995, 1998's ""Superstar Series: Sting Unmasked"" & 1999's ""Sting: Back In Black"" home videos) along with comments from other superstars wrestlers & personalities such as Hulk Hogan, Johnny Ace, Brodus Clay, Natayla, Ron Simmons, referee Charles Robinson, Dean Ambrose, Tony Schavonie, Ric Flair, Kevin Sullivan, Mike Graham, Booker T, Vader, Jimmy Hart, Kevin Nash, Diamond Dallas Page, Lex Luger, William Regal, Billy Kidman, Bill Demont, Bill Apter, and Dusty Rhodes on various subjects such as the beginning of his career, superstar status, feuds with Ric Flair & Vader, being the face of WCW, his face paint, evolution into ""the crow"" character, origins of the scorpion death lock, his run in the Wolfpack, his entrances from the rafters, and his legacy.

Now normally I give my summary at the end of my review but with his set being so highly anticipated, I'll give it now. It's no secret that many important matches from Sting's career are missing from this set but with the fact that it took so long for a set on Sting to be released (due to his association with TNA for around a decade) that a high amount of those matches were either released on other DVD sets in the past or as recently as their network with all the past WCW PPV's & Clash Of The Champions events easily available not making those matches as valuable as they once were (same issues that effected the recent Great American Bash & WCW PPV Matches DVD's this year alone). With that being said, this set is a mixed bag as I'm glad that they went the route with the high majority matches on here being more rare unreleased television matches but there were too many short unimportant matches & segments that could have easily been replaced with other television matches of better quality (his lost classic NWA Title match against Ric Flair from ""Saturday Night"" in August 1993 comes to mind right away) but overall is a satisfying & long overdue collection for either long term Sting fans or a way to introduce him to newer fans.

Matches Include:
The Blade Runners vs. Bret Wayne Sawyer & Sean O'Reilly - It should be noted that Eddie Gilbert was their manager at this time in what was nothing more than a dominate showcase of both men as a team using their assemble of power offense.
""UWF Power Pro Wrestling "" Apr. 86

w/Rick Steiner vs. Mike Rotundo & Ron Simmons - Eddie Gilbert & Shaska Watley were at ringside as Simmons & Rotundo out-wrestled over both men heavily working over their arms with various poundings & stretches such as an armbar causing Sting & Steiner to use tactics such as taking advantage of the referee & double teaming using power offense.
""Southern Pro Wrestling"" May 87

vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - Flair starts off in his trademark chops in the corner only for Sting to answer with a series of press slams giving him momentum where Flair's offense had no effect as he focused on Flair's back throughout the match while Flair was showing effects of Sting's offense but able to catch Sting & use his momentum against him working over different parts of the body including the arm & legs while resorting to tactics that earned him the name ""the dirtiest player in the game."" I believe this was their first televised encounter against each other & served more as a preview for their later career making Clash Of The Champions encounter but you definitely saw the chemistry between both men they would continue to have throughout their careers.
""Pro Wrestling"" Jan. 88

vs. Stan Lane - Sting kept staying one step ahead of Lane using his own momentum against him in the process catching him to execute his offense such as a hip toss or press slam along with reverse Lane's attempt to work over a body part before Lane was able to execute this same strategy on Sting allowing him to use his various styles of kicks along with some illegal tactics with Jim Cornette on the outside as well.
""Main Event"" Oct. 88

vs. Butch Reed - Both men started out exchanging punches before Sting was able to take control heavily working over Reed with a side headlock before Reed resorted to a cheap shot to gain control working over Sting's neck & throat area through moves like a reverse chinlock & other illegal tactics as both men traded momentum catching each other to turn the momentum in their favor.
""Main Event"" Mar. 89

vs. NWA Television Champion Mike Rotundo - Mike attempted to gain the advantage by keeping Sting down & grounded early only for Sting to gain momentum by using Rotundo's own against him to send him over the top rope & heavily wrenching a headlock either on the ground or a standing position as both men went back forth with each man starting to gain some offense only for the other to counter or break the momentum themselves such as Rotundo constantly going to the outside to catch a breath before they continued to go back & forth with Sting launching an aerial attack & kept going back to his headlock while Rotundo used whatever he could to his advantage from the ring ropes to his fellow Varsity Club members on the outside.
""World Championship Wrestling"" Apr. 89

vs. Ron Simmons - Sting used the strategy of constantly taking Simmons down with clotheslines & dropkicks while Simmons resorted to brawling tactics in & out of the ring along with bending the rules to his advantage as they went back & forth with Simmons using power moves while Sting was hitting some impactful offense of his own in a competitive match.
""Power Hour"" Aug. 89

NWA Television Championship Match vs. Great Muta - This was to determine the vacancy of the Television Championship after their controversial Great American Bash title match months earlier as both men started out in stalemates with Muta eventually gaining control with his martial arts offense resulting in Sting attempting to catch him off guard with quick cradle pin attempts sending Muta to the outside changing his strategy by getting help & using tactics such as choking while working Sting over on the outside only for Sting to give a receipt taking the match to the floor as well with the action getting out of control with outside parties getting involved & innocent people getting in the way of the action.
""Power Hour"" Sept. 89

vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - This was the big return of Sting after his leg injury early in the year looking for revenge against the man who kicked him out of the Horsemen & had him get injured later that night. To insure a fair fight, Sting's group of friends called ""Dudes With Attitudes"" surrounded the ring to ensure the Horsemen wouldn't interfere while Ole Anderson was handcuffed on the rampway to El Gigante. Sting took the fight right to Flair & dominated him in the early going showing no signs of ring rust as Flair heavily targeted his knee so Sting kept coming back & fighting off Flair's attack.
Great American Bash '90
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship; WCW's Greatest Pay Per View Matches Vol. 1; United We Slam: Best Of Great American Bash]

vs. Dutch Mantel - This wasn't a squash match more than an offensive exhibition for Sting as he was able to execute some of his trademark moves along while focusing on a specific body part & having an immediate comeback for anything Mantel attempted throughout the match to the point where it took desperate tactics from Mantel to get some amount of momentum in his favor.
""Main Event"" Sept. 90

vs. Nikita Koloff - Sting was looking for revenge after being attacked by Nikita & his russian chain as he sprinted to the ring going straight after Nikita only for Koloff to keep taking Sting down & keeping him grounded in the ring targeting the ribs while also working him over on the outside in a very dominate fashion to the point where Sting was able to get an occasional shot or quick pin but couldn't mount any series of offense before being able to get a second wind using Nikita's own strategy & offense against him to the point where it all came down to who was able to capitalize on a mistake his opponent made.
""Clash Of The Champions XV"" June 91

w/Great Muta vs. Steiner Brothers - This match had an interesting setup as Sting's opponents were his close friends while his partner was a man who was one of his biggest enemies to the point where they faced off against each other at this same event a year earlier in Muta but they did show mutual expect towards each other. Each team played to their strengths early on such as Muta's speed & Sting's intensity along with Steiner's strength & teamwork as the Steiners were able to use a variety of power moves either from the ground or coming off the top rope eventually singling out one member of the other team while Sting & Muta was able to either counter or even use their own offense against them while showcasing some teamwork offense of their own while have no issues going aerial themselves. This was a competitive contest despite one team being a long term established tag team & the other being two individuals teaming for the first time.
WCW/New Japan Supershow II 92

vs. Vader - Vader was out to collect on a bounty put out on Sting by WCW Champion Lex Luger leading into SuperBrawl while it should be noted that Luger's manager at the time was Harley Race who was also Vader's manager as Vader started out very dominate punching him down in the corner causing Sting to respond trading fist himself as both men traded momentum with Vader heavily using his size & weight to his advantage to pound on Sting while Sting was able to use his own strength & athletic ability to take Vader off his feet on more than one occasion while both men have no problems taking advantage of their surrounds on the outside of the ring as well.
""WorldWide"" Feb. 92

w/Barry Windham, Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes vs. Dangerous Alliance (Rick Rude, Larry Zbyszko, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton) - This was a preview of the upcoming SuperBrawl II PPV as the match started out right away in a huge brawl with Sting's team taking control & remaining one step ahead playing to their strengths such as Windham using the taped fist hand they broke months earlier & Steamboat's martial arts resulting in the Alliance resorting to tactics such as playing the numbers game & singling out one of their opposition heavily working over a part of his body. A fun tag match.
""World Championship Wrestling"" Feb. 92

vs. Diamond Dallas Page - Cactus Jack was on commentary for this match after delivering his famous ""Sting's ribs"" promo where he headbutted a wooden crate as this was a pretty quick match with Sting taking control a majority of the match while DDP was able to show that Sting ribs weren't completely healed from the injury by Vader months earlier.
""Saturday Night"" June 92

vs. Barry Windham - Sting was looking for revenge for Windham's involvement with Vader whipping him with a leather strap as Sting went right after Windham shrugging off & countering any offense or dirty tactic Windham attempted before he was eventually able to gain some momentum using a mix of brawling & wrestling tactics along with going aerial in match that was competitive before things started to get out of control to the point where one man just completely lost it & was more focused on other things than just winning a match.
""Saturday Night"" Feb. 93

vs. Stunning Steve Austin - Austin attempted to play mind games early to no avail as both men were evenly matched early with both men showing not only the same offensive strategy but also the same counter as well while both men also struggled to have the same pin attempt against each other before Austin was able to heavily focus & work over a body part in a nice encounter with both men being very even throughout the match.
""Saturday Night"" Jan. 94

vs. Ric Flair - The match was determined by a fan vote with Sting looking for revenge against Flair for turning against him at the previous Halloween Havoc event as Sting attacked Flair grounding & pounding him being very dominate working him over in & outside of the ring with Flair's offense having no effect only for Flair to take advantage of Sting's mistiming & keep resorting to illegal tactics to keep things in his favor as they traded momentum throughout the match until it became clear what one man's true intentions were & couldn't be stopped until someone got in his ear.
""Nitro"" Nov. 95

vs. Arn Anderson - This match occurred the night after Bash At The Beach where Hogan revealed himself as the third man within the newly established New World Order as both men attempted to work over each other's arms early taking the match both in the ring & around ringside before Anderson was able to heavily work over the back area with strikes & submissions along with having no issues cutting corners to gain an advantage with the bigger issue being what happened around ringside that drew the attention of only both wrestlers but others as well.
""Nitro"" July 96

w/Randy Savage vs. Nasty Boys - Savage came out with someone else's property as Nasty Boys started out in their usual brawling tactics & continued to use double teaming along with whatever they could get their hands on while Sting & Savage relied more on keeping the Nasty Boys off balance & even using some of their own strategy against each other in a quick but entertaining match.
""Saturday Night"" July 96

vs. WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan - Over a year in the making here as with Sting's first match (on television) since Fall Brawl the year before with Hogan coming out of the box beating on Sting with punches with Sting responding with dropkicks sending Hogan to the outside before Hogan knocked Sting down & Sting getting right back up after Hogan decided to show off. The match got taken to the outside with Hogan using Sting's own trademark bat against him while also using the ring post & guardrail before taking the match back into the ring where he was dominate to the point where it looked like he won the match at one point before another figure from Hogan's past appeared to make sure nobody got ""screwed."" This match will go down as one of the most disappointing main events in history because the in-ring action itself never seemed to leave past first gear (which they made up for in later matches) with the finish itself not being what the people wanted & the fact that it was botched too didn't help matters. The match wasn't bad but it didn't live up to the hype.
Starrcade 97
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]

w/Lex Luger vs. Hollywood Hogan & Randy Savage - This was a preview of SuperBrawl VII as this brawl started in the isleway with each wrestler fighting against their opponent at the upcoming PPV to the point where this was two individual matches happening at once however the constant issues between partners on one teams were so apparently that it almost looked like three matches happening at one time as this was very short & only served the purpose to pushing the stories going into the two PPV main events.
""Nitro"" Feb. 98

WCW Championship Match vs. Kevin Nash - Konnan was in Nash's corner as he worked Sting over with big blows causing Sting to resort to taking him off his feet to gain some momentum resulting in Nash using tactics typical of the nWo to regain the advantage as both men went back & forth with each man focusing on a specific part of the body in a good match but was more about pushing the issues the nWo had with not only WCW but also within themselves.
""Nitro"" Apr. 98

vs. Scott Steiner - Steiner attacked Sting the moment he got in the ring causing Sting to rebound taking Steiner off his feet & to the outside causing Steiner to resort to illegal tactics typical of the nWo both in & out of the ring when things started to get out his control in a very short encounter.
""Thunder"" Apr. 98

w/Kevin Nash vs. Harlem Heat - Sting joined the nWo Wolfpack a week earlier & defeated Giant to gain sole possession of the WCW Tag Team Titles at Great American Bash the night before leading to this encounter where he chose his championship partner in Kevin Nash while this was also a reunion of Harlem Heat with Booker also winning the Television Championship the night before. Sting was in control early with Booker showing signs of his knee still hurting from his TV Championship series with Stevie Ray being constantly yelling at Booker to be more aggressive than he was in the ring before tagging him & showing his intensity while Sting & Nash were showing signs of teamwork with quick tags & singling out one man keeping him from his partner with Harlem Heat showing that they weren't on the same page.
""Nitro"" June 98

w/Warrior vs. Bret Hart & Hollywood Hogan - This was set a preview of Halloween Havoc as members of both teams had matches scheduled against members of the opposing team as Sting was dominate against both men early on before Hogan & Hart resorted to desperate & illegal tactics to gain control & keep the momentum before the nWo got involved the moment Warrior was going to get his hands on Hogan as this match was short & wasn't much past the historical factor of Sting & Warrior teaming together for the first time in 13 years.
""Nitro"" Oct. 98

vs. Bret Hart - Bret had words for Sting a week before their Halloween Havoc match leading to this match with Sting dominating Bret in & out of the ring with Bret not able to get any offense in until he was able to catch Sting using cheating tactics before one man was able to apply their signature submission move with the intention to not win this fight but hurt the other man.
""Nitro"" Oct. 98

vs. Randy Savage - This match started out of control from the very start with an unusual distraction allowing Savage to dominate right from the start working over Sting in the ring & around ringside with brawling & illegal tactics while his valets in Team Madness having no issues getting physical themselves multiple times as this match only got more out of control with anyone getting in the way ending up getting taken out themselves as Bobby Heenan defined this encounter perfectly on commentary, ""Savage is exactly that...A SAVAGE!""
""Nitro"" June 99

vs. WCW Champion Booker T - Both men showed mutual respect towards at the start as Sting targeted Booker's injured leg working it over in the ring & taking the match to the outside as they not only traded signature offensive moves including having the same idea at the same time for one but also having to deal with their issues with others in a short match that was good for what it was.
""Nitro"" July 00

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match vs. Jeff Jarrett - Both men had deals with their friends to be granted a WCW Championship title match on the upcoming ""Nitro"" setting up this match with the stipulation of being a 10 second rest period between falls. Sting was dominate taking Jarrett off his feet multiple times in the ring & taking the fight around outside to the stage area to the point where Jarrett had to resort to desperate tactics to gain advantage as they traded momentum using the same offensive strategy against each other with the action starting to get so out of control with neither man showing any concern for who got in the way.
""Thunder"" Sept. 00

w/Booker T & Goldberg vs. Jeff Jarrett & Kronik - This was a preview of the upcoming Halloween Havoc with 5 of the 6 men having matches against each other at that PPV as control went early to Sting's team using the strategy of taking control by keeping their opponents off their feet through a series of offense & power moves with one man focusing on his opponents legs causing Jarrett's team to resort to dirty tactics such as triple teaming to regain momentum before this eventually broke down into brawl involving more than just the six legal men involved with one man's strategy to take advantage of the situation backfire.
""Thunder"" Oct. 00

vs. Ric Flair - They wrestled on the first Nitro & this was the final match on the last Nitro. Both men tried going out & having fun which you could clearly see they both exchanged smiles at one point but anyone who watched the Ric Flair documentary knows that he stated that he was out of shape (hence wearing a T-shirt) & neither guy had wrestled in months so they weren't at their best here as we saw at one point that Flair was unable to do his top rope flip. This wasn't their best encounter but definitely far from the worst but is very important in the history of Nitro for this being the final match in the original WCW.
""Nitro"" Mar. 01
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro]

(Blu-Ray) vs. Vader - Vader started off working over Sting with big blows but an intimidation slap caused Sting to respond taking Vader off his feet with a ""ground & pound"" offense & giving Vader a few big blows of his own as these two men traded momentum as Sting resorted to big impactful moves including coming off the top rope & going to the outside to either counter or keep taking Vader off his feet while Vader used his power & size advantage including coming off the ropes himself & powerful strikes across Sting's body. This wasn't one of their famous encounters but both men have always had that natural chemistry against each other & this was no exception.
""Saturday Night"" Oct. 94

(Blu-Ray) w/Hulk Hogan vs. Bruise Brothers - This was a pretty short & sweet dominate encounter that wasn't anything special past this being on of the first & rare times Hogan & Sting teamed together.
""WorldWide"" Nov. 94

The only non-wrestling moment showcased here is the debut of his ""crow"" character where he spoke the last words he would for over a year in 1996. Other Blu-Ray matches include a tag matches with Barry Windham vs. Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard along with Lex Luger vs. British Bulldog & Jin Neidhart while other Blu-Ray extras include past promos & moments of his career including receiving the Pro Wrestling Illustrated ""Most Popular Wrestler"" Award, a vignette with Robocop, joining the nWo Wolfpack, and his final WCW promo on the last Nitro.

As I said earlier, I wouldn't consider this a ""Best Of"" as many of his more famous & important matches from his career are missing but a high percentage of those matches are available on their network or other DVD sets so we get more rarer & lost matches from his career with the only downside to that being that some matches couldn't have been replaced by others in the same category but I won't nitpick in that this is a collection to have for fans of WCW or the man himself in Sting.",1410652800,5,23216,4.594979483466087

8661577,4,B00KU3Y40O,"This is an okay Sting Blue-Ray from the perspective of a WCW fan.  There are lots of great Sting interviews on this Blue-Ray but they are old interviews. Sting is not involved with this production which was made in 2014. And also the are not many pay-per-view matches on this Blue-Ray, mainly Nitro and Thunder matches. But besides that this an okay buy. The early material on Sting from the late 80's and early 90's is fantastic. You get great matches with Ric Flair, The Steiner Brothers, a young DDP in 92, and old Arn Anderson at Disney MGM in 96. There's also another great match where Sting and Hulk Hogan tag up against The Bruise Brothers in 94. Lots of cool bonus interviews on this Blue-Ray as well.
