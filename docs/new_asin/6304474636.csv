I found I had more questions about animal behaviour at the end than I had answers, but I was  riveted to every second of this film. If you love nature, and finding  animals just as they are, not as Disney would make them, you will find this  video fascinating, puzzling, moving, and the best ever of its kind. Don't  watch if you loved ""The Lion King"". But if you appreciate nature  unmarred my human beliefs, needs or predjudices, this is the video for you.  I only hope they continue their research. I would love to see an update.",929145600,2,664,4.401639344262295
890157,5,6304474636,"This is not ""Bambi""! At the time it was produced, such brutal reality was rarely depicted. In fact, it's rarely depicted now! The story and drama of life around waterhole will quickly pull you in. I saw this film when it was first broadcast, and caught it another time on cable, and later on streaming media. But I just had to have a hard-copy of this, so purchased the DVD. It's a real lesson in how difficult and unforgiving life is in the wild, and the incredible struggle animals go through just to survive from day to day. One small warning: I agree with what other's have said here--be warned if you have animal-loving children in the house who might want to see this. Check it out yourself first to  judge if they are old enough to deal with the issues the documentary raises.",1494374400,,783,4.4375

This is documentary film making at its best.  The narration by Powers Booth is excellent.  The imagery and cinematography is so dramatic, and action packed that much of it has the feel of a fiction-based movie.

Nature, as this documentary abundantly demonstrates, is red in tooth and claw.  The struggle between hyenas and lions, as shown in this remarkable documentary, is as real as it gets.  While some may shy away from this depiction of reality, I think anyone truly interested in our world and all of the creatures that share it should watch this, if not own it.",1457568000,,686,4.491935483870968

890486,5,6304474636,"My mother bought me the VHS just after The Lion King came out and I became infatuated with hyenas. This merciless documentary follows a pride of lions and a pack of hyenas and it soon becomes clear that happy endings are not on the menu. The makers have no qualms showing the viewers how hyenas take apart baby lions that died from snake bites, or a stiff, dead lioness. Hyena cubs kill one-another. Formerly popular hyenas find themselves exiled and bullied, and whatever new leader the hyena pack comes up with, provokes some lion into killing her sooner rather than later.
The climax of this film is, to me, the epic chase scene where the lead male lion chases the hyena leader that had previously defied that lion's brother. Just when you start to wonder why the tiny hyena is trying to get ahead of the male lion chasing ""after"" her while she could just have stayed behind him and bailed, you see the reason why she was running so fast... A scene to hold your breath for, and absolutely worth buying the DVD - which I recently did for old time's sake.

Image and sound quality are good considering the age of the material.

Not suitable for kids. Any fluffly baby animals die cruel deaths.

On a humorous note, the feud between lions and hyenas as shown in this documentary, beautifully illustrates the Middle East conflict: the hyenas could lead a perfectly good life on the outskirts of lion turf but they just have to provoke, and thus get killed by, the much more powerful lions.",1339113600,,1488,4.5655430711610485
890487,5,6304474636,"Riveting.  This documentary follows a pack of hyenas and a pride of lions in their competing territories.  It shows in detail their brutal battles against each other and competing clans of their own kind.  I gained a greater appreciation and understanding of both species, but be warned - it's not for the feint of heart.  Beautifully filmed and narrated, a must see for any one who enjoys these types of animal documentaries.",1334707200,,426,4.875
890488,5,6304474636,"Excellent depiction of the lives of lions and hyenas in south]central Africa. Intensely engaging, well narrated, and superbly written. The great lengths the documentary went to capture many moments of these creatures' lives allows us to glimpse at the particular births, lives, struggles, and deaths of individuals of both species. The single best point is the emphasis on the social aspects of each species, as both the narration and the film allow us to see many of the struggles and duties that regulate life in the prides and clans of these two creatures.",1333584000,,559,5.021505376344086
890489,5,6304474636,"This is by far one of the best wildlife films ever produced.  After watching, you will never again question the role of the male lion within the pride.  This is definitely not a nature films for children or the faint of heart.",1331251200,,226,4.357142857142857
890490,5,6304474636,Brutal and honest! The best documentary I have seen. A fantastic look into the daily struggles of both lions and hyenas as they compete against one another.

890491,5,6304474636,"Didn't want to devote 2 hours+ to watching a real movie, so I decided to watch this hour long documentary about the eternal rivalry/hatred between lions and spotted hyenas in Botswana. Just want to add my five stars to the mix, as others here have gone into far more detail on just how moving and intense this documentary is. I'm actually still shocked as to how fantastic this was. AMAZING!",1327363200,,391,4.6
890492,5,6304474636,"This was one of the best National Geographic documenteries when I saw it on TV years ago.  I was excited to be able to buy it on DVD now.

Made by the outstanding nature filmmakers, the husband and wife team of the Jouberts, who always seem able to catch film footage of live, wild animals which no one else can record, it again brings us as up close to live endangered animals as most of us will ever be.  Any of their documentaries are worth watching.

 The lion pride is fairly large, with two large males (typical for a big lion pride)who are closely related and who work together to help hunt, defend and maintain the territory so the females can do the majority of hunting as well as all the care and raising of the cubs.  The male lions, whom I've often heard referred to  in previous documentaries merely ""lazy"" and shown taking advantage of the lionesses hard work in hunting, actuall y do actively participate in about 1 in 10 hunts, especially of very large prey.  They also defend the pride as needed, as we see in remarkable,exciting, chilling footage in this documentary.

There is also a closer-than-usual look at the hyaenas, who, if a person HAD to invent an unpleasant animal ""villain"" would fit the bill......yes, I know they are living on instinct as are the lions, but honestly, they are not the wild animals most of us would want to know better!

The story----as with most Joubert documentaries there IS a story----pertains to the ongoing, never ending, struggle between a specific  hyaena clan, its' matriach,  and the lion pride in the same territory. Each group tries to steal one another's kills, and also if possible will kill each other and the young cubs if able to do so.

The violence is graphic and probably not for very young kids or very sensitive adults either.  Yet, one must be aware, the killing and struggle is part of the survival mechanism both groups must use to keep themselves and their young alive.  Lions, despite or because of their iconic status and beauty are at very high risk for extinction.

The events shown----which I do not want to spoil----are at times very sad, very upsetting and yet give us that first hand look into the lives of these great predators who, like us, want to survive and raise their young. The cycle of life and death, normal in nature, and blunted for us by modern science and technology, is one that has been in existance for millenium.

A short  documentary, but well made, moving, and one that will stay with you.  Highly recommended.",1325030400,,2512,4.617117117117117
890493,5,6304474636,"Gives you an insight in the life and struggles of these animals which can take you on the journey of a lifetime. You can directly co-relate yourself to it, and feel the roughness,tension and enmity depicted in the Documentary.",1323475200,,226,4.82051282051282

890545,5,6304474636,"There is just something special about a lion. There is a reason why he is the the king of the jungles. This movie shows you the raw brutal power of the king among other simply mind blowing unbelievable up-close footage of Lions vs Hyenas.
I recently did an African Safari in Botswana, through Moremi and Chobe game reserves, and I was extremely lucky to witness the tracking of the lion and hyenas thanks to my amazing guide. We first saw several vultures which indicated there was a kill nearby. Followed them for some time until we discovered the Lion cubs. They were guarding one of their brothers feeding on Elephant carcass, wonderfully camouflaged in the dry vegetation, eyeballing us all along while we tried to track them. So you know what this means, specially if you have seen The Lion King; the hyenas should be close by! Lo and behold, about 20 minutes later we see a female hyena sneak up and wait for her turn for the carcass. She was alone, or atleast we thought she was since we couldn't see any other hyenas around. Imagine that, waiting for her turn, and there are atleast 5 lions around. We waited around for an hour or so to see what was going to happen, but it grew dark and you have return to the campsite when it gets dark. So...
My point being - the thrill I got witnessing this event, I relived that while watching this brilliant documentary. I highly highly recommend this to anyone who loves lions. I really wish this is released on Blue-Ray at some point...",1318464000,,1485,4.503703703703704
890546,5,6304474636,This isn't easy to watch. It seems that all of life is suffering and much of it self-induced by hate and hostility. But the truth is worth watching and this film is the best there is on this topic. Sensitively done.,1315958400,,215,4.2682926829268295
890547,5,6304474636,"Lions may live up to 15 years in the wild, if they're lucky to even live that long. Hyena's have an average life span of 12 years in the wild, if they're lucky as well. So 15 & 12 years respectfully for the lucky ones, is not considered an eternal life span for them to be everlasting enemies. It would mean even after they die, they're still able to carry out enemy acts against each other, for all eternity.

Lion Cub mortality rates in the wild is very high, with studies suggesting between 50-67 percent-plus of cubs die. The highest level of mortality is with first time lioness mothers. Lion studies in the Serengeti suggested 25 percent of cubs were taken by predators, 28 percent starved and 47 percent died of unknown reason, many having simply disappeared. So where are the eternal lives, they are referring to?

Eternal Enemies is considered one of the best nature documentaries. It was made in 1992 and is more exciting, than most movies made today in high definition can claim. It is by far the best nature documentary that I have ever seen. No nature film made in the last 15 years, comes close to the rare footage that this documentary offers.

I first viewed this film back in 1992, and learned a great deal about Hyenas that I never knew. For starters Lionesses do fear Hyena clans, and are easily intimidated by their loud laughing cries. Hyenas do not fear Lions as we were all taught to believe, because the Lion is supposedly the king of beasts. Hyenas out number Lions and are inherently better suited for harsher conditions than them. Only the Leopard has more intelligence, than both the African Lion and the Hyena. Hyenas avoid male lions, and have been known to attack them as well if fighting over food, or to save another hyena. Hyena's have a bite force that's at least 400 lbs per square inch greater than that of a lions bite force.

This documentary will show two instances, of a male lion killing a hyena, and will also show Lionesses being attacked viciously by Hyenas until the lions run for their lives up a fallen tree. These same Hyenas would have eventually killed these lions, if it were not for the life-saving tree they escaped into. I was very surprised by the aggressive nature of the hyenas towards the lions, and surprised by the fear portrayed by the lions in general.

This documentary even shows lionesses, killing a rival lioness from another pride. This was very rare footage, bloody, vicious, it's easy to feel pity for the lioness that was out numbered, viciously attacked and killed, but fought very hard for her life. Over-all this documentary is way better than the two lion films that came out in the spring of 2011 that's in 1080P high definition. They only have the edge in picture clarity, but Eternal Enemies has the edge in absolute substance, and never before seen, uncut, unedited, cinematography material.",1314835200,2,2870,4.675247524752475
890548,5,6304474636,"A great story about a pride of Lions and their woes and joys in life, including ripping those nasty hyenas to shreds.  Bravo! I enjoyed this more than many Lion and Africa tales, I give it a 4 1/2 thumbs up, out of 5.",1311724800,,217,3.9318181818181817
890549,5,6304474636,"My sisters and I enjoy watching Discovery/National Geographic/Nova 'nature programs' and this title was a pleasant surprise definitely worth watching.

What can I say without ""spoiling"" the plot of events that unfolds in this 60 minute production? For one, it's great video footage that captures both conflicting sides and their everyday happenings. Thinking back on it now, it's very similar to watching a movie of gang warfare in L.A., only it takes place in Southern Africa, doesn't have bad acting and features less rappers pretending (or perhaps not 'pretending'. Hmm..) to be drug dealers!

If you're not too familiar with the behavioral instincts of either species - or even if you are - you'll be quite likely to learn a thing or two about the way they function. I certainly did.

While lions have the size advantage, hyenas have strength in numbers and both will attack each other back and forth claiming lives during the day, and at night - never having the chance to fully let their guard down. Much like in our world, the sooner the alpha male - or in certain cases, 'alpha female' - is taken down, the sooner a lower-ranking member will come to take their place.

The most peculiar thing is, you'll grow attached to prominent members of both sides as you see them grow and interact with one another. You'll see them both protect and attack members of their own species, and the narrator will clue you in on who's who, both in the roles they serve and the name they've been given by the production crew.

Aside from the spectacular night-vision footage, there are also some unexpected surprises from some third-party creatures which can also have a profound effect on the daily lives of the lions and hyenas in question.

This is a highly recommended, if heartbreaking, production.
Check it out once you get the chance! I definitely plan on watching it again sometime!

890551,5,6304474636,"Out of all the National Geographic documentaries I have seen in my life, Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas is my favorite of all time. The reasons are because it introduced me to Dereck and Beverly Joubert's documentary films, this film is the archetypal National Geographic documentary, and the my favorite animal of all is the lion. My favorite part was at the end when we see Ntchwaidumela, ""He Who Greets with Fire,"" kill a hyena matriarch that was harassing his brother over the territory. I was blown away by the slow-motion scene of him running and chasing the hyena and hearing Powers Boothe say ""He is the hyena killer."" I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves National Geographic, lions, and the Jouberts' films.",1284422400,,732,4.864
890552,5,6304474636,"I remember seeing this show for the first time when I was maybe 14 or 15. I remember being quite disturbed by the deaths of Masumi's cubs and of the Southern Clan's first matriarch. I felt quite sorry for the Princess, who lost everything in that one second that it took Entwaidumeyla (sp?) to bite through her spine. I don't take one group's side over the other. After all, they are animals, fighting for survival, and our morality is misplaced upon them.

As with everyone else, I was riveted by the scene where Masumi and Entwaidumeyla chased down the Southern Clan's second matriarch and did her in as well.",1277424000,,611,4.605504587155964

My wife and I visited Botswana in 2003.  While two of the camps at which we stayed were in the Okavango Delta, a third (Duma Tau) was up at the North end of Botswana near the Caprivi Strip which is a piece of Namibia that reaches out to touch Zimbabwe.  It is near here were the Linyanti River once flowed and changed its course, perportedly due to some seismic event.  The Savuti Channel is the dry river bed where the Linyanti once flowed.  This is where ""Eternal Enemies"" was filmed.  The safari vehicle drives you along the depresseion that was its river bed.  You can see trees lining what used to be the banks of the river and low vegetation grows down in the channel.  There are many stories going on at once, something that might be only guessed at in the national geographic special but you have to go there to experience it all for yourself.  We saw a pair of huge ground hornbills walking around looking for small prey in one direction while a spotted hyaena in another direction shadowed a cape hunting dog in hopes that he might steal whatever he found.  A flock of carmine bee-eaters escorted our vehicle to capture the grasshoppers and other insects scared up by its tires.  We later saw a flock following an elephant using it for the same purpose.  We came around a corner to find a family of bat-eared foxes sunning themselves.  They went just out of view when you put enough of the isolated shrubs between you and them.  No doubt they could easily detect a lion with their enormous ears who might try to sneak up on them.  All around us there were countless soap operas going on at once; too many things to pay attention to them all.  Simply an amazing place.  When we got back to camp, we had to wait fifteen minutes because a large bull elephant was feeding on a tree at precisely the spot where we were supposed to disembark.  We then had to follow this elephant down our foot path because he wanted to feed on the trees just outside our bungalow.",1240617600,,2211,4.385749385749386

It makes you appreciate your own mortality seeing how easily anyone of these beautiful creatures can die in such a savage and primal way. It is amazing to see how loathing and hate these two creatures have for one another and yet there is no good guy, because you feel sorry for both by seeing how each  groups deals with its own trials and inner group strife.

The documentary follows a pride of lions and a pack of hyenas.  The information it delivers is really amazing.  Information about the diet, reproduction habits, social order, behaviors, the range and so much more of these animals is brought to you in excellent video and narrative.
But it's the story of the individual animals that draws you in.  The story of a lioness raising her cubs - and the hazards they see.  The ""Hyena Queen"" raising her ""princess"" and the requirements and hazards of that job (it's really hard to like these bizarre animals).

My high school students were riveted by this video.  It is excellent for showing the Savannah biome and animal interactions.  They would actually stay after the bell asking to finish it.  They cheer and cry over the battles fought in the lives of these animals.  Yes, even some of the boys cried over those cubs.
It is:
1. Beautifully filmed
2. Packed with information
3. Compelling in it's story

I could still remember a large male lion chasing a hyena and for a brief moment I thought the lion would give up the chase knowing that male lions are not made for distance running. But it continued and soon pounced the leader of the hyena pack, killing the animal instantly with a single bite to the neck.

The cruelty shown in this footage should not be seen by children, but is extremely educational for those who have the stomach for it.

There is also a segment on the agony of a poisoned lioness that is terribly sad, and hard to watch.

You will learn things about hyenas that will surprise you: It is a matriarchal society, where the males are smaller, and their role in the pack quite marginal. The females also have the appearance of hermaphrodites, and engage in ""mock mating"", caught on film here for the first time. We also witness their habit of fratricide, where the most powerful of the young will kill its weaker brother or sister.

The ferocity of the hyenas, coupled with their ""laughing"" sounds, make these scavengers truly ""the horrors of the night"".

Much of this documentary is chilling, some of it is very moving, and all of it is unforgettable. Filmed in the northern regions of Botswana, the creative forces behind this film are Dereck and Beverly Joubert, and the narration of the beautifully written (and often quite poetic) script is by Powers Boothe.

Eternal Enemies isn't education, it's drama.  At times, really compelling drama.  These aren't anonymous tired animals, few and far between in a habitat steadily being destroyed by civilization.  It isn't a guilt trip about the selfless efforts of scientists to study and help save some endangered population.  They managed to find an area of africa that is FULL of all kinds of wildlife, and focus on specific characters that play out an amazing and unsettling war story.

This is an excellent piece of work that establishes the fact that man is not the only animal that wars.  Lions and hyenas seemed to have a general intolerance and hatred torward the other that does not stem from any particular moment or cause.  Through trials and tribulations, one aspect of these to amazing animal's personalities stays the same, a deeply-seeded disdain for the other species.  The documentary follows a pride of lions dominated by two male brothers, and the rival pack of hyenas dominated by a female.  At kills hyenas use their numbers to overwhelm the female lions while the males are not there.  The lions, one male in particular, retaliate whenever possible.

890820,5,6304474636,"this nature film is probably the best nature film ive ever seen.it shows to perfection the shear hatred lions and hyenas have for each other. no where else in africa is the hatred between lions and hyenas so intense than in botswana and dereck and beverly joubert have shot it down to a tee, especialy the lions,probably more so in two of the lions, one mattsumi a lioness who was bit by a snake and then had her new born cubs eaten by the hyenas and untwydumala the dominent male he tends to attack and kill hyenas  at every possible chance.the end scene is truly amazing,  where the hyena matriarc is tormenting the older male lion mandayvoo, when mattsumi attacks the matriarc the commotion is heard by untwydumala, who rushes out of the bush, the hyenas then scatter. mattsumi then chases the matriarc of the hyenas and trips it just to slow it down enough for untwydumala  to catch up and make the kill.if your into lions this is the one.truly awsome.",972432000,4,956,4.546511627906977
890821,5,6304474636,"The title sums it all up. The Joubert's(pronounced jou-ber) are great makers of wild life drama(and i mean DRAMA). The tale(i call it tale-mentary) is gripping and concentrates on a clan of Hyenas and a pride of Lions. The photography is excellent and ""Savuti's"" most feared denizens come to light in this documentary. The Hyena's uniqueness is potrayed well and so is their societal order. There are some moments frozen indelible on a viewers mind. -the king of the beasts clamping on the hyena matriarch. -a mother's(lioness) disastrous encounter with an Egyptian cobra.
After having watched this you come away knowing that all animals are the same yet unique and individual. This is a great video , one not to be missed. I highly recommend it.",970617600,3,746,4.928571428571429
890822,5,6304474636,"After watching Eternal Enemies. I got a great education in learning about these two fearsome competitors. The Lions & Hyenas. I don't think there are two more hated rivals. But there is no question who rules and that's  the Lions. hyenas when there at full strength can intimidate female lions  but there no match for the male lions. You can see the fear in Hyenas have  when a male lion is around. The battles they has were fierce but the Hyenas  had no chance against the huge male lions. But let's not say the Hyenas are  not a formidle advisary to the Lions because they are. And will fight Lions  to the bitter end. I recommend this video as a ""must see"" if your  interested in learning about these two animals. I could gone on & on  about how great this video was but you have to see for yourself.",953683200,2,803,4.306666666666667
