7722725,5,B01DR3ZQ0U,"If you were stuck on an island (in a desert, on Mars, etc.) and you could have only one food, drink, toy/game, piece of music, what would it be?  The music question is an easy answer for me - Beethoven's 9th, and this production gives it all the justice it deserves.  The film makers included English subtitles for the coral of Ode to Joy.  I was able to connect the music and the words like never before.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful ...",1469232000,3,442,4.419753086419753
7722726,4,B01DR3ZQ0U,"This program introduces you to one of the greatest works of music ever composed, performed by an orchestra comprised of young and diverse classical musicians that might get young viewers excited about classical music or filming music. In this hour and half program we are treated to a performance of Beethoven's powerful Symphony No. 9 by an orchestra and chorus that includes a significant number of young performers. The performance took place at Princeton University to celebrate the 100th birthday of philanthropist William Scheide, to whom the orchestra and audience sing Happy Birthday at the end. A wonderful opportunity to observe musicians engage in musical conversation at the highest level. Be forewarned that viewers have to sit through an introduction before the music is performed. With all due respect, this part will likely bore young viewers and has little to do with Beethoven, who is given brief coverage.",1465171200,2,924,5.25

8756670,2,B01DR3ZQ0U,"Performance was brilliant, brilliant piece of music,  but it's the 3rd copy I've purchased and each disc has had the same problem of no sound from the left surround channel in the 5.1 setting once the performance begins. My receiver shows its encoded in 5.1.
Tested it on another player as well as a friends $500 Oppo player. Same problem. Manufacturer's defect is my only guess. I get five channels albeit not discrete channels if it's played in a prologic setting. Not the same but for $15 I guess I'll live with it.",1505779200,2,518,4.56989247311828
8756671,3,B01DR3ZQ0U,This would have been just wonderful if everybody would have shut up and let Beethoven's 9th be the star.,1496966400,,104,4.526315789473684

8756675,4,B01DR3ZQ0U,"I found this classical sound both exciting and soothing (although I still don't get the absolute need for a conductor). I'm not sure how this sounds with another orchestra, but with the Vienna and their Choir, it is simply perfect.",1484524800,,231,4.8
