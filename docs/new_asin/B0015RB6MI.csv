3147068,5,B0015RB6MI,i AM A FITNESS INSTRUCTOR  AND THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO FOR WHAT i do!,1257120000,4,67,3.466666666666667
3147069,5,B0015RB6MI,"i've been workingout for almost two years, lost 50 lbs. practicing different forms of excersices, including scott cole's tai chi and now his later dvds. i love them all, try them and you'll be surprise. he is great, a professional, a great human being, you can figure it out as soon as you do his workouts.",1213228800,14,306,4.482142857142857
3147070,5,B0015RB6MI,Really like this DVD...didn't think there were so many moves you can make and I know I'll get in better shape.  Scott is very likeable and knowledgeable too so I feel I'm learning from someone who knows not like some of the instructors who put out stuff.  Nice DVD.,1211846400,19,265,4.387755102040816
3147080,5,B0015RB6MI,"I could not believe you could do so much sitting in a chair.  I am in my 60's and have been told by my doctor to stretch to keep my joints moving,  Scott Cole knows how to get you to move no matter what your age or capability.",1326240000,3,226,3.6875
3147081,1,B0015RB6MI,"I have some difficulties with my lumbar spine as well as tendinitis around the hip flexor muscles. I got this dvd because it is hard for me to do any exercises that require standing or put undo pressure on one leg at a time, and I thought this dvd provided exercises done while seated . Unfortunately for me, this work out is all about standing in back of the chair, bending knees, and often baring your weight on one leg and it causes me great pain. Also, though my knees don't typically hurt, they do when I do some of these exercises. Proceed with caution.",1292457600,24,559,4.333333333333333
3147082,4,B0015RB6MI,"I picked this DVD because Scott is so cute! I'm a 50+ guy in San Francisco, who let my gut grow quite a bit.
This DVD is a bit hard on old knees. I'm hoping in time my knees will grow stronger from this. DVD is good for stretching, especially in the morning - to get the blood moving.
I was hoping for a little more work on the ""core"" - the belly part that is crucial for back support. But for the $8.00 I spent on this, Scott is adorable & I figure getting started with some exercise is better than nothing.",1284336000,2,508,3.941747572815534
3147083,4,B0015RB6MI,"My wife & I have been doing these exercises for 2 weeks.  We are in our 60's and are able to do 98 per cent of them.  If you live where all the outdoor work is done for you then these are great for improving muscle tone, stamina and breathing.  We don't like doing them but anyone can make themselves do almost anything for 36 minutes.  We recommend this dvd.",1281830400,5,359,4.085714285714285
3147084,5,B0015RB6MI,"I bought this video to help me loosen up my body due to siatica on both sides, as well as Fibromyalgia and OA.  This was a was a good workout and I plan to use it as part of my regular exercise routine.  Now if I only had a personal trainer to see to it that I actually DID exercise regularly.",1281657600,4,293,3.7868852459016393
3147085,3,B0015RB6MI,"I personally think the order of the program should be reversed, that is, with the stretching segment first.  The strength part is not for me - WAAAYYY too much bending at the knee, very painful for my 60 yr. old knees, so I simply skip this part.  Had I known the strength part was so knee intensive I would not have purchased this dvd. I've done yoga for several decades so find that the positions are not held long enough for me.  I usually pause the dvd so that I can hold the positions longer, as long as my body wants to.  At some point, I will write the sequence out as pause/play is cumbersome.  The stretches are good and I've learned a few new ones, expanding my knowledge base. I would not recommend this dvd for folk w/knee issues whatever their age.",1274918400,21,761,4.293706293706293
3147086,4,B0015RB6MI,"I was delighted that this chair exercise DVD focused on both standing and sitting lower body exercises supported by a simple chair.  Other chair DVDs I purchased focused too much on the arms or upper body. My legs really burned after this chair workout and I felt safe supported by a chair both sitting and standing.  Scott gave good instructions on the muscles being worked and constantly encouraged proper body alignment.  There is no class of students.  He works out with you one on one.  There are 2 workouts on the DVD - one is lower body strengthening, the other is stretching and relaxing.  I thought that both workouts were excellent.  There were only two things I would change.  One is that the warm-up starts with deep squats and one-leg squats which I think is too soon - especially if you have knee challenges.  The second is that during the strengthening part of the video, the music is too loud.",1273104000,13,909,4.63125
3147087,5,B0015RB6MI,"I have purchased many fitness videos in the past; everything from yoga and tai chi to walking workouts and Latin dance.  I recently decided to get serious with something I might actually do, instead of getting frustrated with a 1/2 hour or hour workout that I didn't have the patience, time or stamina to finish (sometimes even learn).  I was pleasantly surprised that this video was everything I wanted.  It is in 3 parts so you can do both the strength and stretch together or choose whichever one you need in the moment.  In Both segments, Scott's personable directions are easy to follow and although a chair is involved, the strength portion is a true workout!  You definitely have the ability to grow with this video and I can see how both the least fit person (my end of the spectrum right now) and the most advanced (Scott Cole) reap the benefits of these moves.  Can you only lift your leg an inch?  Then that's as far as you push it. In the beginning I did not have the stamina to even complete all the moves in the 15 minute strength segment, but individual movements are short enough that I could just wait a second and it'd be on to the next move I could do.  The whole workout is short enough and varied enough that I don't get bored or overstressed or discouraged, which keeps me motivated to do more.  Because I have been able to stick with this (and by no means am I at even an intermediate level) my strength and stamina have improved.  This has enabled me to actually alternate days with one of those other videos (for cardio) I was talking about in the beginning of my review.  For me, staying motivated has been spurred on by feeling successful.  This dvd makes it easy to feel successful.

I realize as an after thought that I have not said much about the stretch portion of this dvd, which is equally wonderful. It did not strike me with the same lightening as the strength, probably only because I have never had as much trouble stretching and relaxing as I have working out.  I would liken it to beginner yoga that you don't have to get down on the floor for (nice for anyone who might have trouble with that).

I reccommend this highly, especially to anyone who has trouble starting or sticking with a program.  Since your own fitness level determines how hard you work this program, it's easy to envision this being a staple of anyone's exercise diet.",1271894400,34,2378,4.469907407407407
3147088,3,B0015RB6MI,"I have several health issues and have become weak, thus needing an exercise program that works from a chair.  To my surprise, the warm up section of the DVD is standing behind the chair, or holding on to the chair for support.  I am not able to do this, and without a warm up, don't feel that it's safe to work out.  So I am stuck now, trying to find something more appropriate to my situation.  3 stars, as I am sure it's good for other people, but it shouldn't show the guy sitting in the chair stretching out, if that's not what will be done.",1267401600,19,545,4.113207547169812
3147089,4,B0015RB6MI,"Scott Cole's instruction is easy to follow. His voice and manner are pleasing. Note that in one of the two segments, the chair is used as a balancing aid: You stand to do leg work.  The other routine is done while seated.",1266364800,9,221,4.261904761904762
