MISS JULIE is one such film, and it seems entirely fitting that one of the greatest Swedish films ever made should be based on the work of one of Sweden's greatest writers. Every single aspect of this film is perfect; the black and white photography, the wonderful musical score by Dag Wiren, the acting from all the cast, but in particular from Anita Bjork who sets a standard in playing Miss Julie that could hardly be bettered. The play which provides the screenplay is of course devastating with the inexorable interplay between class and rank, and human desire and lust overlapping and intertwining, and too, the now almost forgotten concept of ""duty"" and ""honour"". If you like movies that make you think, eat away at your heart and memory long after you have seen them, then I cannot recommend MISS JULIE more highly. In the fifty years since it was made, its brilliance has not diminished one jot. A masterpiece and a film to truly treasure. My one regret with the VHS print is that although the sequence is intact, the lettering from the original credit titles has disappeared.",1014249600,22,1270,4.699551569506727

7865949,4,6304270798,"Growing up in Sweden, I was familiar with this story by August Strindberg.  I have seen it as a ballet (probably on TV).

This movie had lots of interesting views of the people at the estate.

I was fascinated and will keep it.

Thanks!

7865950,5,6304270798,"This, the best ever version of Miss Julie by a man who both directed plays and films. Sjoberg did innovative plays of Shakespeare and Strindberg. This plays central location in the kitchen is opened up into the surrounding landscape. He drew inspiration form German expressionism. In Torment with Bergman as scriptwriter, he visualises the whole of society as a prison. Bergman used these techniques in Sawdust and Tinsel and The Silence. The old master had rubbed off on the young master.

Sjoberg wanted to honour Strindbergs brooding chamber play, whilst opening it out with the spectacular virtuosity of camera mobility and deep-focus framing. Sjobergs unfastened eye roams over the grounds of the heroines noble estate-trees,statues, swans.water lilies, we also get spectacular movement of horses, boats, people. But solid matter is made to yield at turns to memory or fantasy, as the story of her life is told, with mother, fianc, Jeans social climbing, she the captive caged bird.

The two chief characters are brilliant, both vulnerable and vying for the upper position in a survival of the fittest only one can win. The brilliant use of dream dissolves and sequences, people from different times in the same scene. The subtle use of lighting to heighten the psycho-drama, the beautiful fluidity of the cinematography, great movement and framing. There are scenes here worthy of Orson Welles  2 best films, Citizen Cane and The Magnificent Andersons. The film depicts the gender politics and class consciousness of this forerunner of D H Lawrence.

What is especially interesting is the way images dissolve into other images bringing to the fore(more than in the play) memories of the past of the two lead characters. There is a good dream sequence where she (Bjork) is on a high rock, can't move, fears falling, then falls ;his (Palme's) dream is of a man always climbing to the top most branch and can never reach the fruit. He longs to be loved by her, longs for the unattainable. She knows that sex is the great fall. He both knows and doesnt know his place. She longs for escape from the iron-hard laws of aristocratic privilege.

Bergman followed on and overtook Sjoberg as the magus of Swedish cinema but this film has the structure of a well made play with a mercurial swiftness of image and the conveyance of emotion that could have taught the younger man, his protg, a few things. This is an example of the well made film, bringing to it all the brilliance of transition and interior dream drama that became evident in Strindberg's Dream Play.",1279670400,4,2561,4.932714617169373
7865951,5,6304270798,"Even though by using the expression ""Age of Glamour"" people usually refer to the period between two great European wars, in the cinema world the age of glamour, I think, came around mid 1960's. Surely during the first half of XX century scores of cheap B&W melodrama movies were produced, but after the ""new wave cinema"" and ""kitchen sink realism"" have petered out it became more and more difficult to produce anything serious even in the indie niche market, and since late 80's the whole movie industry essentially became more and more children-oriented.

Films like ""Frken Julie"" bring us back to the years when the movies were still created ""in earnest"" and watched not ""for fun"" or ""for kicks"" or to get thrilled or because of the ""special effects"" - but to feel empathy and to understand other human beings. Film is based on August Strindberg's play, which was written, like many of his works, to express his frustration and spite he felt towards women. While this attitude won't find too many open supporters today, it's difficult to deny Strindberg's work its seriousness and expressive power.

The film ""Frken Julie"" is definitely a match to the play in every sense. It's very realistic, showing life in Sweden with love and knowledge of detail, but also - with uncompromising frankness. Strindberg play's burning misogyny is fully transferred to the screen. Countess Berta, miss Julie's mother (Lissi Alandh) is shown as a live monstrosity, destroying the life of her husband and making her daughter insecure, manipulative and cruel towards everybody and anybody.

Alf Sjberg, the director, did not produce a commentary to the play, his approach was - to be true to the Strindberg's letter and spirit. The film was produced in 1951, and its influence on Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" (1957) is beyond doubt.",1265673600,5,1816,5.006622516556291

7865953,5,6304270798,"Strindberg seemed to anticipate the ontological loneliness, the boredom, the immature frivolity and the no sense of living around a impetuous young who having been rejected by her fiance decides to flirt and eventually seduce her servant.

If you watch this film with the glasses of the actual society, you will find it something dated, but if you observe from another perspective, you will find interesting clues that may lead you to link the essence of the Existentialism (Think in Albert Camus The foreigner) and three outstanding films released after: Joseph Losey ` s The Servant, Bergman 's The silence and Bertolucci `s  Last Tango based on Alberto Moravia.

It's a crime to arouse a passion only to satisfy a caprice.",1131235200,9,725,4.975206611570248
