8612258,3,B00F4EXZ90,"Not a lot of re-watch value.  Most episodes run like an infomercial for certain brands. Nice to add to a collection of gun dvds but nowhere as good as Top Shot. I suggest $15 or less if you must own it. They have shoot offs gun vs gun that aren't remotely close to each other. M14 vs a Mosin Nagant, for example. Why not an AK47 vs M16 or 1911 vs Luger. Shoot offs should be kept to Guns that are roughly the same time period.",1421193600,3,426,3.953488372093023
