8503662,1,B006RXC2QO,"Was so disappointed in this-based on title and 5 star review,I expected to be Challenged by this and felt as though I needed to workout after my workout. There weren't enough reps of each excercise,the cardio was too easy and she added stretches throughout workout after I hadn't even begun to sweat. I felt very sweaty after her Reboot 2 workout although that one took a few tries before I mastered the footwork. This one I doubt I'll ever use again. I'm almost 51 and have had several excercise related injuries and this still didn't make me feel worked at all/it was more like an extended warm up then a workout",1513296000,,614,4.54054054054054
8503663,5,B006RXC2QO,this is one of her best to me in her newer series.  It's challenging but doable I will always keep this in my rotation.,1394409600,3,119,3.9583333333333335
