7945044,3,B00005M2FX,"this is not a battle royale. it's a fight between eighteen and ""mighty mask"". but maybe it's just not my definition. Goku and Vegeta should be very proud that they're stronger than The S-kai. of course they don't know it yet. despite the fact that this is boring I'm glad that eighteen and ""Mighty Mask"" knocked the hoo-ha out of kilah and jewel, {yes, that's how you spell thier names} espaclly kilah! That guy talked WAY to fast and you couldn't understand a word he says. {and he thinks ""mighty mask"" is talkin' funny}",1017532800,,521,4.553191489361702
7945045,3,B00005M2FX,"This dvd is the most boring one in the Babidi saga in my opinion.  Goku fights Yakan, then Goku, Gohan, Vegeta and Supreme Kai are waiting for Dabura the rest of the time.  The world tournament moves along though.  Great menu and music.",1006732800,,236,4.441860465116279

The last disc was great featuring the battle inside Babidi's ship. However, that action takes a back seat in this disc. You do get to see Goku show his strength against a big ugly, but thats about it. The main plot focuses on the Tenkachi Tournament. The only REAL fighting you get is between 18 and Goten and Trunks, disguised as Mighty Mask. It was pretty fun watching Goten and Trunks switch places each time and display their ENORMOUS strength.
Still, 18 discovers their little game and I don't want to spoil what happens, but lets just say they both get into a lot of trouble. Mister Satan is going to have his hands full when he squares off against 18.
The Japanese version is way better featuring 18's smooth voice and Goten's Gohan-esque voice. The dub version does some justice, but not a lot to the action. There are some great moments of rock for the fight scenes, but there is come childish music for Goten and Trunks. Overall, not a highlight of DBZ, but a worthy disc to add to any collection.",1005436800,3,1254,4.456521739130435

7945050,5,B00005M2FX,This is where everything gets set in place for the final stretch of DBZ....will Majin Boo be unleashed on the world(kind of anti-climatic if he isn't huh) and what will happen when the Z fighters get ivolved? Gohan is healed(good job Kibito) and everyone's ready for a rumble at Babidi's ship. But can the Z fighters stop the evil sorcerer type alien guy and Darbura?
