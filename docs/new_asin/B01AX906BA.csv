7613833,5,B01AX906BA,"I'm just here to mention that the other pointlessly low rated reviews here are biased.  It is a very good anime based on one of the best visual novels of all time so give it a little credit whether you love the genre or not.  Yuuji is one of the very few protagonists in a harem that is a bad as*.  He isn't indecisive or oblivious and he is a powerful fighter too (unlike most weak harem leads getting carried by the girls, with some exceptions).  The girls have interesting personalities, which is accentuated by their tragic flaws.  Anyway let's skip the blah blah about why it is good and get to what you might not like.
First and foremost this is a harem anime, I imagine if you are here you know what that means, love it or hate it.  Also at the beginning it has an almost absurd amount of pantie shots, which for me even in ecchi is still bizzare to me.  Not because I don't like ecchi but meh, just letting you know.  I'll end this here because I don't want to say anything remotely spoily.  Worth your time if you like ecchi harems with plot.",1462838400,14,1051,4.215
7613834,5,B01AX906BA,"Grisaia is one of the best anime I've seen in years. It has wonderful charactars, fantastic drama, and has satisfying conclusions to each of the 5 main girls. Also the MC Yuji a breath of fresh air. He isn't stupid, doesn't freak out when he sees a girl naked, and he's a bad ass in every sense of the word.",1461974400,7,307,4.133333333333334
7613835,4,B01AX906BA,"Fruit of Grisaia (FG) is a harem-thriller mix centered on hitman Yuji Kazami who has had a most unusual childhood and teenhood and gets enrolled in a high school in an attempt to normalize his life. This high school turns out to be just as unusual as his life, a school with only 5 female, attractive, rich and most troubled students who will go crazy about their new classmate.

This is FG, usual anime pleasing our unspeakable-inner-most fantasies. At least it went off from the average harem genre by setting a strong male lead rather than the usual weaklings in many other series. Yuji doesnt bother us freaking out when seeing naked female bodies.

Yuji has a negative and repressive outlook on sex. He grossly derides Amane Suous initial bold sexual advances, both of them tone down, but she continues offering herself. She also takes on his cooking and cleaning.  However Yuji's also has a realistic outlook as he knows that such behavior is not normal. This makes the show interesting and uplifting as Yuji respectfully but firmly sets to get to know and understand Amane. She had a quite traumatic experience where Yuji's sister helped her and seemingly died meanwhile. Therefore she felt in debt with him. I have no idea how realistic that scenario is, but it sure is morbid.

Someone came with the conventional and flawed argument about cultures to explain Amane, see my answer to him. BUT another one did make a good case basing  Amane's actions on guilt, that was more sensible and eventually made me re-rank the anime because Yuji did not think she had to sacrifice like that, let alone thinking she had to die with the rest of her group, a traditional Japanese convention. FG's creators deserve a lot of praise for promoting such human behaviors.

The cases of other girls Michiru, Sachi and maybe Yumiko were slightly uplifting and could resemble Clannad in the way that a strong male lead helps other pretty girls in trouble just to make friends and they trust him easily. Talk about fantasy, yet we need these kind of heroes. The rest was bunk. Yuji gets his ways without many explanations, all he needs to do is being cool and then he can even kill a millionaire gangster (Makinas mother) without much trouble. Even silly series such as Baka and Test are far smarter.

FG displays morbid and misguided views on sex. For instance, Makina Irisu also tries to sexually seduce Yuji, yet later on she lashes out in a hotel at the room of another couple having sex. She talks in morbid ways from time to time.

FG displays the past and reasons to be of each of the girls, but not Yujis. They left his past for a movie and a 2nd season, which I only skimmed thought briefly. If you want fan service FG has a fair amount, sex is good if you like it implicit. As for a thriller, it's sloppy. All in all FG is fairly entertaining and stands out for Amane's story and Yuji's choices, as well as his tolerant ways.",1455926400,11,2921,4.593090211132438

8748743,4,B01AX906BA,"This story is good. How can I say, it's also just kind of ""American sniper"" ,and it's also ""Boy meets Girls, like Girls Game story"".
Next season "" Labyrinth of Grisaia / Eden of Grisaia "" 'll be also recommended.
This package is Japan BD edition.

8748744,4,B01AX906BA,"Finished binge watching this about a week ago, played the Visual Novel for about 5 hours before watching the Anime and I must say I quite enjoyed the Anime. VN Fans might be on a different opinion on this but seeing as how I have only gotten about 5 hours of that and there are sooo many different choices for the Visual Novel, what I have seen so far from the Anime has been great.

I do not feel like the story progresses too fast or too slow EXCEPT for at the first two or maybe three episodes but character introductions are most definitely always a necessity, some of which happens there might possibly translate into more in future seasons but as far as I know from both the VN and the Anime I am quite unsure :(

The characters are quite likeable ( except for my personal opinion, Michiru's VA can be kind of ear piercingly high pitched at times xD ), I disliked the main guy, Yuji in the Visual Novel from what I have experienced of his character so far but as the story in the Anime progressed he became quite character to be relatable to and I absolutely love his blunt answers which he gives to the girls.

Don't be deceived by the occasional fan-service scene, this is NOT a cutesy anime ( although I can be at points ) this show is dark to the core which I love about this show, there is always something getting thrown into the story which keeps you wanting to move on to the next episode to see what happens next, accompany this with some sympathetic ""oohs"" and dramatic ""ohhhh sh*t's"" and you have The Fruits Of Grisaia.

I would get into more detail as to how dark this show may get, it probably isn't nearly as dark as plenty other anime but it just must be said this is not one you watch for the cuteness, this show does occasionally have some of the dark perverted Japanese humor which I adore but it should be noted for those who get offended easily *chuckles*

* YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!  *

I honestly feel that the show ends waaaaay too abruptly, something extremely dramatic JUST happened and all of a sudden everyone is just celebrating when somebody ( or a group of people ) should be damn near traumatized over what just happened. I think the season needed another episode to prevent from concluding it so suddenly, leaving a somewhat bad taste in my mouth from what was otherwise an amazing season of anime. Do not let this prevent you however from watching this show, and if you enjoyed the anime then that means the Visual Novel will have waaaayyy more to offer you as far as consumable plot and even other random backstory. ^_^

Thanks for taking the time to read my bad review, thank you for supporting and buying great shows like this by speaking with your mouth and now downloading illegally!",1463961600,7,2770,4.385964912280702
8748745,5,B01AX906BA,Very good.,1463616000,,10,4.5
8748746,4,B01AX906BA,"While I LOVED the animation style and the way they deliver the characters' lines, I will say it felt rushed and was definitely a different story than the VN. It definitely tied in extremely well to the sequels however, so I'm comfortable rating it 4 stars",1463011200,3,255,4.565217391304348
