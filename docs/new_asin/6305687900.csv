1065039,3,6305687900,"This was a very mediocre PPV. Although it did have it's highlights.
Survivor Series elimination match
Godfather, D'Lo Brown & Head Bangers def. Dudley Boyz & Acolytes
Not a bad opener. Head Bangers went first, they're ... so thats good. D'Lo finally won for his team last eliminating Bubba Ray Dudley. ***
Kurt Angle def. Shawn Stasiak
It wasn't a bad match, kinda boring though. Angle is great but Stasiak is just pants. ***
Survivor Series elimination match
Val Venis, Mark Henry, Steve Blackman & Gangrel def. British Bulldog & Mean Street Posse
This was a lot better than the first SS match. Blackman, Gangrel and Henry were hilarious by eliminating the Mean Street Posse straight away. Then Bulldog impressed me by taking out both Gangrel and Blackman easily. Venis finally put Bulldog away with a Money Shot. ****
One-Fall sudden death match
Fabulous Moolah, Mae Young, Tori & Debra def. Ivory, Jacqueline, Luna & Terri
This was way too short. Moolah finally got the pin on Ivory, i do like Mae and Moolah but they demean the women's division when it has genuine athletes like Ivory, Jackie and Luna. This was the first time i ever saw Jacqueline and i just think she is great!!! ***** (i'm biased, any match with Jackie in is 5 stars)
Kane def. X-Pac by DQ
This was probably the worst match on the card. Kane was battering X-Pac (good thing!) then DX runs in and ruins it. **
Big Show def. Boss Man, Prince Albert, Mideon & Viscera
Another mediocre match. Big Show destroys Albert, Mideon and Vis, but thats no big thing as they are all pants anyway. Boss Man runs off, Big Show wins (woooo) ***
WWF Intercontinental title match
Chyna def. Chris Jericho
Finally, a decent match. This is the best match on the card in my opinion. Chyna and Jericho bring their feud to a head in this match. Chyna finally gets the win with a pedigree from the top rope. Plus Miss Kitty was at ringside which is always a good thing. *****
Survivor Series elimination match
Hardy Boyz, Edge & Christian def. Too Cool, Hardcore & Crash Holly
Again, this match is ok, nothing too special. Hardyz & E & C are great but the opposing team are useless. Jeff Hardy gets the win by pinning Hardcore. To think they made this match drag on forever and they cut the women's match short. **
WWF Tag Team title match
New Age Outlaws def. Mankind & Al Snow
Why was Mankind put in a match like this? He should have been in the main event!! Anyway Mankind and Al put on a great show making the usually boring New Age Outlaws bearable, but they don't win the Tag titles. ****
Triple Threat match for the WWF title
Big Show def. The Rock & HHH
Stone Cold gets run over so we have to suffer the Big Show. An exciting match made crap by the big lump of nothing. Only good parts were when Big Show was down. Not only did we have to watch a humiliating performance by Big Slow, but he actually won. ***

While the ppv will always be a pivitol part in the WWF Championship, the ""whudunnit"" had the potential to be one of the best story lines ever and could have brought forth a revolutionay multi-month(maby a year) long feud between HHH and Austin. what turned out was a sory, very uninvolving ending pitting Rikishi(what?) as the car driver. HELO! This is not a good ending and the feud lasted all of four months. This could have been Hart vs. Austin of '97 resurected. Back to the ppv, the main event was a 3 star match, and Kane vs. X-Pac(doesn't ...!) got a 4.",997056000,,706,4.48062015503876
1065043,3,6305687900,"Well, I've watched it thousands of times, but it could of been better. I thought the match with Jericho vs. Chyna was pathetic. Chyna got hit in the head against the steel part of the ramp, got hit in the head with the championship belt, torchered through the walls of jericho, was powerbombed and bodyslammed and lionsaulted so many times the dumb girl would of been unconscious or dead. But no she gets up at the very end and does one pedigree to Triple HHH on the top of the ramp and wins...?? The got scrwed so much more and does one stupid move andwins...but whatever. Vinnie Mac kinda screwed this event up. It was a disappointment having Austin ran over. I think they should have waited until after the last match because millions of us watched it to see Austin. And the Big Show's not bad...but still. And then Vinnie came out right when Hunter was gonna win and smacks him over the head and screws up everything...i liked how Big Show eliminated all those guys though, especially Viscera...hehe",972259200,,1003,4.5777777777777775

1065045,2,6305687900,"I can't believe it, the WWF actually tried to cheat their fans by promoting a match, Austin vs. HHH vs. The Rock, on every possible outlet  available, RAW, Smackdown! and even one hour before the pay-per-view on  HeAT... only to have Austin ""run over"" half way threw the event  and being replaced by The Big Show. Thousands of people were cheated out of  their hard-earned cash live, don't be stupid enough to buy this terrible  video. The Survivor-rules matches were awful, each one being announced a  week before the event with no apparent storylines or build-up. What a  waste.

1065098,1,6305687900,"If you missed this one, be glad.  God, I feel sorry for anyone that  actually paid the tickets to go watch this awful, awful PPV event.  And the  ironic thing is that this is the PPV I wanted to see more than any of the  others.  I mean, DX had just reformed in one of the best conclusions to a  Raw I had ever seen, and HHH got back that sense of humor he'd been lacking  ever since leaving DX in the first place.  At the end of No Mercy,  remember, The Rock unintentionally cost Stone Cold Steve Austin the WWF  Championship.  That brings tension between Austin and The Rock, who both  feel they should be number one contenders to the belt.  Vince then  scheduled a match I and many others would've loved to see: triple threat  for the WWF title between Champion HHH, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The  Rock.  Oh man, oh man, I just had to see this!
Now the PPV went along  badly.  The eight man elimination matches were jokes.  IC Champion Chyna  vs. challenger Chris Jericho was a well-performed match and the outcome  actually surprised me.  X-Pac vs. Kane, a match hyped up as well, was  reduced to several minutes and the best thing about it was Tori getting  kicked in the face.  Kurt Angle's debut may interest some fans, competing  against who the WCW refers to now as ""The Pefect One"" Shawn  Stasiack.
Now my hopes of this PPV being redeemed by a great main event  were tarnished once Stone Cold got hit by a car driven anonymously and sent  to the hospital.  Meaning he will not be able to perform for the main  event.  Yeah, great way to get him out of the picture so that he can get  his real-life neck surgery.  ANYWAY, he was replaced by THE BIG SLOW(???).  Now rumors were circulating at this time.  Some thought Austin would come  back at the end and turn heel to join Vince or something like that.  But  that didn't happen.  Vince, for the third Survivor Series in a row, does  his little screw-job thing and we award a new champion: the Big Slow,  sobbing because he feels he's made his late father proud.  (By the way, the  whole angle with his dead dad was in poor, poor taste).  The WWF  championship goes straight to hell up until HHH wins it on the first Raw of  2000.
Don't go see this one; it's not worth it.  But if you want to check  it out, be my guest.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",960595200,,2312,4.258139534883721

1065103,5,6305687900,"Most reviews have said this Survivor Series was terrible mainly because Stone Cold Steve Austin was absent and replaced by a surprise wrestler. The way I see it Survivor Series was the most unthinkable event in history.  Most fans wanted Stone Cold Steve Austin or The Rock to walk out as the  champ, but it was neither, which was shocking to most fans, because those  two are the favourites of all time in the WWF. With the first female  defense of the WWF Intercontinental Title, the debut of the Olympic  gold-medalist Kurt Angle and an unexpected champion, Survivor Series 1999  pulls out all the stops and provides a Pay-Per-View with an unexpected  finale of a result.",950832000,2,674,4.758620689655173
1065104,1,6305687900,"Now, having been a wrestling fan for the last 8 years, I have seen some bad events.  WrestleMania IX, Fall Brawl 98 and Capital Carnage spring to mind.  But I have never seen such unadulterated DROSS from Vinnie Mac in  such a long time.
If you look at the back of the box and see the matches,  you would be disappointed.  You could tell it was going to be no classic  event when you see that the likes of The Blue Meanie, Kaientai and the Mean  Street Posse were involved.
But the amount of poor action that was shown  was shocking.  Only Chris Jericho v. Chyna and the 8-man featuring Edge,  Christian and the Hardy Boyz v. Too Cool and the Holly Cousins were worthy  of credit.  Everything else does not have the right to claim 3 hours of  your life.
And the main event.  Oh, Lord.  I mean, whose idea of a joke  was it to perform such a disgusting bait-and-switch involving the incident  of Steve Austin, who was replaced by the awful Big Slow?  I'm sorry, Big  SHOW.  Well, I'm not smiling, and if you buy this video, you won't be  either.",948931200,2,1044,4.278350515463917

The 3 other Survivor Series matches were  bad, and Kurt Angle vs Staciak was probaley the worst match in WWF history.

7893756,3,6305687900,"1.) 8 Man Survivor Series Elimination Match: The Godfather, D'Lo Brown, and The Headbangers vs The Dudley Boyz and The Acolytes

D'Lo and the Headbangers all dressed as pimps for this match and the Headbangers worse some afro wigs that they looked ridiculous in. Thrasher is the first to go within the first opening minutes, following a Clothesline From Hell from Bradshaw. Mosh is next after taking a 3D from the Dudleyz, giving the Dudleyz and The Acolytes a 4 on 2 advantage. That doesn't last long however as Bradshaw is DQ'd after laying out D'Lo AND Bubba Ray Dudley with a steel chair! Everything becomes hectic following, as Faarooq and D-Von argue about who should pin D'Lo. The argument becomes physical as D-Von and Faarooq pound each other to the backstage area, taking them out for the remainder of the match. This now leaves Bubba to fend for himself in a 2 on 1 situation. After a bit of back and forth action, D'Lo makes the hot tag to Godfather who takes apart Bubba and hits the Ho Train before tagging back in D'Lo who hits the Lo Down on the Dudley for the win. In a post-match celebration the former Nation members and Tim White dance with the hoes

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Shawn Stasiak vs Kurt Angle

This was Kurt Angle's PPV debut and unfortunately for him he gets no reaction from the crowd. This is a short, technical bout with Angle staying in control for most of it. The fans show their disliking for Angle's wrestling style by chanting boring within the opening seconds of the match. They'd come to appreciate him and his technical style years later. Angle gets the win with the Olympic Slam on Stasiak. Decent match for Angle's first PPV match with not a whole lot of respect from the fans though.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) 8 Man Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match: Val Venis, Mark Henry, Gangrel, and Steve Blackman vs The British Bulldog and The Mean Street Posse

In what is probably the most unusual and random match in Survivor Series history, we get this 8 Man Elimination Tag Team match full of superstars that have nothing in common with each other. A porn star, a sex addict, a vampire, and a martial artist team together to fight 3 street punks from Greenwich and a Brit with no gimmick. Pete Gas is eliminated first following a kick from Blackman, Rodney is next after an accidental punch from Joey Abs followed by a DDT from Gangrel. Joey Abs follows after a body splash from Henry. Bulldog is left in a 4 on 1 disadvantage but manages to eliminate Gangrel with a superplex off the top turnbuckle and gets Blackman with a fisherman suplex pin. Bulldog is then left with a 2 on 1 fight against Venis and Henry. Even 2 on 1 is too much for Bulldog to handle and Venis puts him away with the Money Short for the win

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Mae Young, Fabulous Moolah, Tori, and Debra vs Jacqueline, Luna, Terri, Ivory

In what really shouldn't come as much of a shock, this match was bad and it only lasted about a minute! Consistent tagging with a mix of bad wrestling---if it could even be called that. Ivory gets beat on by Moolah and Mae and Moolah pins Ivory for the win. This was at a time when the Diva's Division was not yet truly established and the divas were used mainly for show, which explains why this match was so terrible, even for a match that lasted not even 2 minutes. So basically, a lot similar to today's Diva's division, only today's Diva's division put this division to shame. Debra and Terri have a catfight after the match that ends with Debra ripping Terri's top off.

Lillian Garcia interviews X-Pac about his match with Kane with X-Pac delivering a less than stellar promo saying that he carried the team when he and Kane tagged together, says that Kane is impotent and that he can kick his ass

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) X-Pac vs Kane

X-Pac starts the match, jumping Kane from behind during his in-ring pyro. This is a quick little back and forth match that gets as much action out of it as it can. Kane prepares to Tombstone X-Pac but Triple H runs in the ring and nails Kane with the WWF Championship, leading to the DQ. Road Dogg, X-Pac, and Triple H completely mug Kane in a post-match 3 on 1 beat down. Tori tries to come to Kane's aid but gets knocked out with a spinning heel kick from X-Pac. DX scatters while Kane checks on his girlfriend.

Backstage; Michael Cole tries to get The Rock's thoughts on the main event but before he can answer, Triple H steps in and picks a fight with Rock that has to be stopped by several referees. The Rock gets the sunglasses smacked off his face in the process

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Traditional Survivor Series Handicap Elimination Match: Prince Albert, Mideon, Viscera, and Big Boss Man

This was around the time of the Big Show's father's death storyline with Big Boss Man so Show was pissed going into this match. This was another short match but the shortness of it told a personal story as Show was all about trying to get his hands on the Boss Man. Big Show eliminates Albert, Mideon, and Viscera all within the opening seconds of the match with Chokeslams until Boss Man is the only one left. Boss Man wants none of Show and gets himself counted out before running away to the back, warranting Show to chase after him

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Kevin Kelly is backstage about to get Stone Cold's thoughts on the main event when he's attacked by Triple H. Triple H makes a run for it and Austin chases after him. The chase comes to a head in the parking garage where Austin looks for the game and in what would become an unforgettable Survivor Series moment, Stone Cold is run down by a car. Before long, the McMahons, Test, J.R, Sgt. Slaughter, and EMTs are in the garage attending to Austin. DX shows up on the scene and a livid Vince McMahon who decides to go to the hospital with Austin and points the finger at Triple H but The Game denies being the finger of blame.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs Chyna (c) w/The Kat

The Jericho/Chyna feud was pretty decent, despite Jericho absolutely hating it (as written in his second autobiography) and this match was surprisingly well put on. At a time when men hitting women in WWE was still acceptable, Jericho got pretty physical with the Ninth Wonder of The World in this match up. There even some entertaining moments where Jericho in classic Attitude Era Jericho fashion, gyrated at The Kat before laying a kiss on her. Can't really say I blame him; but I wonder how Lawler felt seeing this as he and Kat were dating at the time. The end sees Chyna perform and fail at doing a Pedigree of the top rope on Jericho for the win

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match: Hardcore Holly, Crash Holly, and Too Cool vs Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz w/Terri

Great, fun match here, featuring some of the Attitude Era's finest tag teams. Edge is the first out after getting rolled up by Hardcore Holly. Matt Hardy goes not too long after, after taking a diving DDT from Scotty 2 Hotty off the top rope. We then get a few minutes of some fair paced tag action between Christian and Jeff Hardy against Too Cool and The Hollys. A nicely executed 450 Splash from Jeff Hardy eliminates Scotty 2 Hotty. Christian gets the next 2 eliminations; eliminating Grand Master with a Diving Reverse DDT and soon after Crash Holly with the Impaler. Hardcore Holly counters an attempted victory roll pin from Christian into a pin of his own to win the match as the sole survivor

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Backstage; Shane McMahon gives an update on Stone Cold, who announces that he's suffered severe head, back, and neck trauma. Shane goes on to announce that the main event will still be a Triple Threat but will not feature Austin

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws (c) vs Mankind and Al Snow

Adequate Tag Team Championship match is next on the card between the team of Mankind and Al Snow against The Outlaws. The Outlaws were hot heels at the time, yet the crowd refused to boo them. The match itself wasn't perfect but picks up going near the end. The commentary between J.R and Lawler was pretty comical though with Lawler chastising J.R about showing no sympathy over what happened to Austin. Road Dogg sends Snow into the steel steps and The Outlaws hit a spike piledriver on Mankind for the win to retain the titles

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

10.) WWF Championship Triple Threat Match: The Rock vs Triple H (c) vs The Big Show

The speculation on who would be Austin's replacement ceased as it turned out to be none other than the Big Show; and Rock and Triple H are not too pleased about it. Rock and HHH work together in opening moments of the match to take out Show and then focus on each other. It's only a matter of time before Show is back on his feet and aggressively inserts himself in the match. This was a really entertaining main event match to sit through and is one of the many matches that summed up what the Attitude Era was all about: fun and exciting matches being displayed at their finest. At one point Triple H and Rock both double team suplex Show through the Spanish announce table. We eventually see multiple interferences throughout this match. First out is Shane McMahon who takes over referee duties after Earl Hebner is knocked out. After Shane gets Pedigreed by Triple H, we eventually see DX get involved and attack both Show and Rock. Not too long after DX's interference, Vince McMahon returns from the hospital and plays a major factor in the outcome of the match. McMahon hits Triple H with the WWF Title, followed by a Chokeslam from Big Show. McMahon makes the count and Big Show wins his first WWF Championship.

Overall: This wasn't the best Survivor Series PPV to be produced by the WWF. At times, this PPV seemed to get tiresome with matches that really had no business being on the card. The divas match and the oddball Survivor Series match are the big 2 that come to mind. At the same time there were matches like Jericho vs Chyna, E&C and Hardyz vs Hollys/Too Cool, and the main event that delivered very well in the ring. I think the biggest disappointment of all when it comes to the 1999 Survivor Series was Stone Cold's need for neck surgery that came at a bad time, as it prevented fans from seeing one of the greatest Attitude Era main events of all time that never happened. Could you imagine how epic the main event truly would've been had Austin not needed surgery and competed in the match?",1415836800,,11633,5.1587891662241105

7893758,1,6305687900,"I stopped watching wrestling right after Vince McMahon won the 30-Man Royal Rumble back in January 1999.  The Attitude Era --- which most wrestling fans and critics declare the industry's highest of highs --- didn't grip me.  So, I stopped watching until right around WRESTLEMANIA 2000, where now MULTIPLE McMahons were making lives miserable for everybody.  Did I miss much in that lost year?  Well, I've been doing some catching up, and am declaring 1999 to be one of the World Wrestling Federation's most pathetic years.  And what better example than the 1999 SURVIVOR SERIES?

1) Survivor Series Elimination Match
The Godfather, D'Lo Brown, & The Headbangers
v. The Dudley Boyz & The Acolytes
---Starts out okay with the usual fast-paced action to get a crowd going.  But then my eyes just started seeing bodies flying around, with no personal attachment to any of them.  It was only until a puzzling three consecutive disqualifications that I finally paid more attention...to my own disbelief, that is.  This opener was just an exhibition showcase, nothing more.
""5.5 / 10""
--------------------------------------------------

2) Shawn Stasiak v. Kurt Angle
---I'm gonna rip on the Joe Louis Arena now.  What was the matter?  You guys didn't recognize a freestyle match?  Had you been so drunk with weapons, screwjobs, and storylines that you forgot what a technical competition was?  Anyway, Angle's WWF debut was a solid contest.  Sadly, the Detroit crowd wasn't into it all (which JR and King admitted on air).
""6.5 / 10""

3) Survivor Series Elimination Match
Val Venis, Mark Henry, Gangrel, & Steve Blackman
v. The British Bulldog & The Mean Street Posse
---Anybody know why the European champion was teamed with three Greenwich preppies?  I couldn't tell from the tape, either.  Let me ask another question: has there ever been successful Survivor Series team that's comprised of a captain, and 3 ""cronies""?  Didn't think so.  Oh well, who gives a rip?  This is another waste of talent, with eliminations so quick, you'll wonder how any of these superstars became champions.
""5.0 / 10""

4) Mae Young, The Fabulous Moolah, Tori, & Debra v.
Jacqueline, Luna Vachon, Terri Runnells, & Ivory (Women's champion)
---Let me get this straight: you have EIGHT women competing (most of them in good physical shape), and the ONE-fall match is only TWO minutes?  Did these ladies not understand the rules?  Were wrestling fans that ""puppies-obsessed"" back then?  Beyond ridiculous, and we're barely an hour into the festivities.
""2.0 / 10""
--------------------------------------------------

5) X-Pac v. Kane
---The first serious effort of the evening...or so I thought.  You'd think a successful tag team like this would have a much better ""breakup"" showdown.  Basically, Kane just beat the snot out of Chyna's lover.  I thought these two could do better, but then again I disliked all of their grudge matches in the months to come.  Cue a DX run-in at about 4 minutes, which resulted in Kane's girlfriend Tori getting EMT'ed out of the ring.  Why were DX getting cheers when they attacked women like this?  Probably because X-Pac learned from Chyna (if you don't get the joke, post me a Comment).
""4.0 / 10""

***Triple H attacks The Rock backstage, adding more fuel to their highly-anticipated Triple Threat Match also including Stone Cold Steve Austin.***

6) Survivor Series Elimination Match (4-on-1 Handicap)
Prince Albert, Mideon, Viscera, & The Big Bossman v. Big Show
---Why am I torturing myself?  How can ONE man (even Paul Wight) overcome odds like this in less than 2 minutes?  It's amazing Big Show wasn't WWF champion yet......oh, now I get it......my goodness.  You think this whole debacle was ridiculous?  Wait until Bossman and Big Show continued their rivalry for another month, used Show's dead father as an angle, and then the PPV grudge match lasted less than 2 minutes AGAIN!
""2.0 / 10""
--------------------------------------------------

***Here's where things got even weirder.  Triple H attacked Steve Austin just like he did The Rock.  But when Austin gave chase, some black car suddenly ran into him.  About 10 minutes are spent with DX, McMahons, medics, Test, and Jim Ross standing around the ""crime scene"" wondering what the hell just happened?  I gotta admit, this was pretty entertaining stuff.  Too bad it killed the main event.***

--------------------------------------------------

7) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho v. Chyna (champion)
---What better way to get a crowd going after seeing their favorite guy get hit with a car?  I'm not being sarcastic; Detroit just ate this one up!  It was interesting to listen to women cheer for Chyna, while the men were rooting for Jericho (probably because of his wrestling background).  I don't think this was that great, but I was mildly entertained.  Plus, I always thought Chyna was impressive as the dominant female.
""5.5 / 10""
--------------------------------------------------

8) Survivor Series Elimination Match
The Hollys & Too Cool v. Edge/Christian & The Hardy Boyz
---Here's a history lesson: Too Cool used to be villains, even with their ridiculous dancing gimmick that won over many fans soon after tonight.  Without a doubt, this was the best match of the PPV.  The first elimination didn't occur until about 7 minutes in, while the entire match took about 15 minutes.  There was so much fast-paced physicality and counter-wrestling going on, I couldn't keep track.  The only real drawback was the crowd and Jim Ross.  This was where the Steve Austin attack started backfiring, because the crowd was on their hands, while Ross was playing his ""somber reactions"" way over the top.  Still, a very good Survivor Series Match.
""7.5 / 10""
--------------------------------------------------

***I think it was after this match where we were told that the main event would remain a Triple Threat Match.  Triple H and The Rock would still compete, w/ Austin being replaced by someone else.***
--------------------------------------------------

9) Tag Team Championships
The New Age Outlaws (champions) v. Mankind & Al Snow
---Remember The Union?  Yeah, I don't either.  Much like the Survivor Series Matches earlier in the evening, I eventually just stopped caring and saw nothing but bodies.  The pace was unbearably slow, and I really don't have much more to say about this.  Not terrible, but so uninteresting I can't even come up with criticisms.
""5.5 / 10""
--------------------------------------------------

10) WWF Championship
The Rock v. Triple H (champion) v. Big Show
---Looks I have to choke on my words regarding Big Show never being a WWF champion.  Before I review the match, I have to admit that I don't understand the real-life circumstances why Austin was removed from the main event.  I also give credit to WWF for letting a ""replacement"" win the big prize.  Too bad the actual showdown was just a sloppy brawl, with the usual ""gang-up-on-Show"" and ""fight-up-the-aisle"" routines.  Seriously, this was 15 minutes of seemingly endless fighting.  I didn't expect top-tier storytelling at this point, but gimme something more than an incomprehensible mess!

Joe Louis Arena

Detroit, Michigan

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Godfather, D'Lo Brown, & Headbangers

V.

Acolytes & Dudley Boyz

horrible opener. Boring match. Godfather & D'Lo survive

Kurt Angle V. Shawn Stasiak

This is Angle's first match and the chants for ""boring"" had to get to him. This match also sucked. Angle wins. *1/2

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Val Venis, Mark Henry, Gangrel, & Steve Blackman

V.

British Bulldog & Mean Street Posse

Better than the first elimination match. But not by much. Val & Henry survive **

Ivory, Jacqueline, Luna, & Terri

V.

Tori, Debra, Fabulous Moolah, & Mae Young

This wasn't a elmination match which was good, but why wasn't the Women's Title on the line?...Oh well...tori's team wins. DUD

Kane V. X-Pac

Not a very good match and it was short. Kane wins by DQ **

Handicap Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Big Show

V.

Big Bossman, Prince Albert, Viscera, & Mideon

Big Show destroys everyone but Bossman because he runs away. DUD

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Chyna (Champion) V. Chris Jericho

Like their Armageddon match...this is the match of the night. Also like their Armagedodn match, this match was solid but because of Jericho. Chyna retains. ***1/2

Classic Survivor Series Elmination Match:

The Hollys & Too Cool

V.

Edge & Christian & Hardy Boyz

Finally a good Survivor Series match but it could have been alot better this given more time. Hardcore Holly is the sole survivor. ***1/4

WWF Tag Team Championship:

New Age Outlaws (Champions) V. Mankind & Al Snow

ok match. Outlaws retain. **

Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship:

Triple H (Champion) V. The Rock V. ???

The questions are there because Austin needed neck surgery and they needed to get him off television so they had a car run him over? Great way to write him off for a while. Anyway...the Big Slow or Show took his place and a good but not great match took place with Show winning the title. ***1/4

Overall, again, way too many matches. Some matches would have been so much better if given more time.",1143417600,,2131,4.873595505617978

Survivor Series elimination match
Godfather, D-Lo Brown, and Headbangers vs. Dudley Boyz and Acolytes
This match started out good, but then Bradshaw gets disqualified! Farooqe and D-Von fight all the way backstage! What happened here!?
Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Stasiak
BORING!
Survivor Series elimination match
Val Venus, Mark Henry, Gangrel, and Steve Blackman vs. Mean Street Posse and Bulldog
VERY BAD! The whole team of MSP is eliminated and its Bulldog against the four. You know who wins.
One fall sudden death match for Women's title
(I don't want to write down all the names)
Too short and too stupid.
Kane vs. X-Pac
Sleeper of the night. D-X interfering made the match more worse.
Survivor Series elimination match
Big Show vs. Big Bossman, Albert, Viscera, and Midian
Big Show eliminates everyone by himself and chases Bossman backstage. DUD!
WWE Tag Team Championship
Mankind & Al Snow vs. New Age Outlaws
Slow and pointless
WWE Intercontinental Championship
Chyna vs. Chris Jericho
FINALLY a good match! I wanted Y2J to win, but the Pedigree by Chyna off the top rope was enough for me.
Survivor Series elimination match
Too Cool, Crash & Hardcore Holly vs. Edge & Christian and the Hardy Boyz
Okay match, but too slow. Could have been better if Too Cool and the Hardy's teamed up against E&C and the Holly's.
WWE Championship Triple Threat match
Triple H vs. Rock vs. Big Show
WORST TRIPLE THREAT MATCH EVER! Stone Cold got run over by a car so the Big Show had to replace him! What a waste of time this match was! Stone Cold could of gotten run over by a car on Raw or Smackdown, but not on a PPV!
Overall this PPV sucked! I'm glad I rented this piece of trash! Get Survivor Series 2000 or 2001, at least they'll keep you interested.",1037491200,,1949,4.685131195335277
