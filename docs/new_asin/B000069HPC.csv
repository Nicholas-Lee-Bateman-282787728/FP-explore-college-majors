Putting Collection Classics across the top of the artwork makes it seem like they'r trying to pass this off as the classic Disney film being rereleased. Beauty and the Beast is an old story and this movie isn't terrible, but if you're looking for the Disney classic, beware that this is not it.",1438732800,,453,4.82051282051282

7965567,1,B000069HPC,"I ordered this DVD not realizing it was not the Disney feature.  Since I had already opened the packaging I figured I'd check it out.  I found this to be a very basic, boring and not a very entertaining version of the timeless tale. The animation is dull and appears washed out.  The story lacks the adventure and excitement I felt necessary to entertain my young kids (even my six-year-old fell asleep).

If you're in the market for the Disney version of this movie be aware that this version is NOT DISNEY.",1140998400,4,508,4.489130434782608

I'll make this review short and provide a little more information than the previous reviewer.  Let's start by saying that this is not the Disney version which is pretty obvious because: 1.  The cover art features different characters and 2. No Disney animated film has 0 reviews.

Anyways, this 1992 version of the classic tale is stunningly charming.  The story is as simple as an old man with 5 grown up children suffering through a grand financial crisis and relying only on hope to regain their place.  After a disappointing visit to the harbor which was supposed to bring him happiness, the old man gets lost in the way back home and is picked up inside a magnificent enchanted castle, unaware that a ferocious beast (With a noble heart) lives inside.  Foolishly, the man steals a simple rose from the beast's gardens, a gift his daughter Beauty had so kindly asked for.  Angered, the beast feels betrayed by the old gentleman and tells him that either him or his daughter must die for stealing the rose, however, when Beauty arrives she manages to charm the beast and break the evil spell that was cast upon him.

While the story-line is simple and sweet, the animation is a little silly.  The greatest part of the film is the opening song, ""The Beauty in the Beast,"" unlike the Disney film, this movie is a musical in the sense that it uses familiar classical melodies to add a story-book feel to it and the voices are quite interesting.  Children often prefer this to the Disney version so if you have a little fan of the timeless tale at home, he or she might appreciate this.  After all, Goodtimes films were meant for children and their ratings would be higher if people only bothered to view them from a child's mind.",1129248000,18,1842,4.562310030395137
