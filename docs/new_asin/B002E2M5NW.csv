3915114,5,B002E2M5NW,"I first saw this ballet in NY in the early sixties with Fonteyn and Nureyev.  Each subsequent viewing with different casts could not be compared to my memory of those first performances.  Some may have danced it better, but the passion was lacking. When I first saw the balcony scene from this DVD on YouTube I was stunned by the melding of perfect dancing and exquisite acting. I was able to become totally engrossed without comparing it to the first performance I saw. I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said Acosta's acting was stiff.  He moved me to tears. If you can only buy one DVD of this production, I'd get this one. If you can buy two, get his and the one with Margot and Rudi.",1273104000,8,695,4.4140625
3915115,5,B002E2M5NW,"I have the original version with Fonteyn & Nureyev, the version with Eagling and Ferri, the LaScalla version with Corella & Ferri and now this one.
I have to say I've never been able to deal with a 46 year old woman playing Juliet so that lets out the Fonteyn version.  Not to mention the fact that MacMillan made changes to his original choreography (which had been made on Gable & Seymour) to accomodate those two ""stars"".
I like the Eagling/Ferri version because at the time Ferri was so close in age to Juliet but Eagling was not the world's greatest dancer.
In the LaScala version I do not like the production at all and find the company quite lacking compared to the two stars.
This performance has it ALL.  It is a lovely production with a good supporting company and Acosta and Rojo are well matched in their wonderful dancing and acting skills.  See it live, see it on DVD, there is just no way around it, the soaring, dramatic music and the choreography that fits it so well, combine to pull you in and by the end you are totally wiped out.  And you can see that in Acosta and Rojo when they take their bows - it seems hard for them to come back into the ""real"" world.
On the newest Manon DVD I enjoyed the special feature ""Dancing Manon"" and I really wish the company had done a similar feature for this one too.
This version will be the gold standard for a long time, I think.",1270944000,21,1388,4.306513409961686
3915116,5,B002E2M5NW,"Most of my Romeos were old Russian recordings that now look very dated with really poor picture quality. The Nureyev choreographed recording from Paris is vastly better and will soon be released on Blu ray, however it is is done with strong emphasis on male sexualism and will not be to everyone's taste. This recording is just superb. The two leads are magnificent dancers and the rest of the cast leave nothing to be desired. The picture quality is very good but perhaps just a little on the dark side and the sound is excellent. There is no competition at the moment and you are unlikely to see much better for a long time anyway. The whole performance is a wonderful blend of brilliant dancing, magical music and all presented in a very traditional way. Do not hesitate.",1266278400,7,774,4.615942028985507
3915117,5,B002E2M5NW,"Beautiful dancing, beautiful music, and the visual quality is excellent. You can see clearly every dancer. In my opinion, this video shows what Blu-ray is capable of.",1265155200,3,166,5.185185185185185
3915118,5,B002E2M5NW,"This is by far the best Romeo and Juliet Ballet out there--and we've seen them all!  Tamara Rojo is perfect as Juliet.  She embodies the youth of the character, her acting is great and her dancing is breathtaking!  The other dancers are also fantastic.  Carlos Acosta's dancing skills are wonderful, but his acting is a little stiff.  Other than that, I'd say you can't do better than this version.  The costumes are beautiful, the lighting is perfect, and the music is well balanced.  I can almost hear Shakespeare's words with this version.  Another plus to this one I like is the view of the orchestra playing during the overtures at the beginning and intermission that you can't see even when you see a ballet in person.  If you buy only one dance dvd, make it this one.",1264809600,10,774,4.591240875912408
3915119,5,B002E2M5NW,"I have seen many productions of Prokofiev's ""Romeo & Juliet"" even one on Ice, but this is the definitive one to own. The title roles are danced by Carlos Acosta and Tamara Rojo and what a couple they make. This production by the Royal Ballet has got to be seen to be believed. It is simple stunning. I could not fault it in any way, the sets and costumes are magnificent. The dancing and fight scenes are impeccable and the Blue-Ray presentation gives you the best seats in the house. The sound and image are extremely clear and sharp. What more could you want! Add it to your collection today.",1262822400,9,594,4.409090909090909
3915120,5,B002E2M5NW,"My partner and I have been ballet fans for several decades and, over those years, we have seen many, many Romeo and Juliet performances, both live and recorded.  Without question, the one depicted on this DVD is the very best we have seen.  In our humble opition, Tamara Rojo has impeccable technique and is without question the best dramatic ballerina in the world.  Her Juliet performance on this DVD will serve as a primer for all future ballerinas who dare to tackle Kenneth MacMillan's magnificent choreography.  Carlos Acosta matches Tamara's artistic brilliance, and their R&J is pure magic!!  By the way, anyone who enjoyed this DVD and has the time and means to visit London may want to know that Tamara and Carlos will be dancing Romeo and Juliet live at Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in January 2010.  See you there!!!",1258329600,19,833,4.830985915492958

The performance was fine, but the score by Sergey Prokofiev just blew me away. Recently I bought the DVD performed at the Teatro alla Scala from 2000. I liked the performance but wanted to see another.
I first saw Carlos Acosta on blu-ray in Khachaturian's Spartacus by the Bolshoi Ballet. Acosta's athleticism was like nothing I had seen in ballet. Then I bought the blu-ray of Acosta in the Royal Ballet's La fille mal gardee. His acting skills in a comic ballet convinced me to get all his performances.
When I saw that Romeo and Juliet had been released with Acosta as the lead, I couldn't wait to buy it. The dancing is outstanding and so is the Prokofiev score. The entire production by Kenneth Macmillan and with Tamara Rojo was flawless, much more satifying than the one from la Scala. This is the one to get.",1254441600,28,1050,5.331325301204819
3915122,5,B002E2M5NW,"Being familiar with the music for many years, seeing it in its original dancing context was a revelation.  It gives much more meaning to the subtle nuances in the composition and reveals a story of deep pathos and emotion. This emotional message is helped in this superb production by the excellent music from the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Boris Gruzin - it is BD audio at its best.  There is less focus on athletic showmanship than on translating emotion through dance and mime and the lovely Tamara Rojo portrays a Juliet with such sadness as to bring tears to the eyes. I classify this as one of the best of the new Blu Ray productions and one which excels in all areas. Recommended without reservation.",1254096000,19,715,4.666666666666667
3915123,5,B002E2M5NW,"Through the decades I have had numerous editions of the Prokofiev version of Romeo and Juliet, film/video and audio. I come from a background of performing dancers (mother and father). The dancing is generally not American Ballet Theater grade but it is excellent. I especially have to commend Tamara Rojo for a mesmerizing job as Juliet, in dance, and expression.
Now to the technical: the video is outstanding and as absurd as it may sound, to me is better than film but that is only if you have a large television that is video calibrated. The audio is the current reference standard in my library which includes numerous EuroArts and ArtHaus DVD's and BluRays. My friend who watched it with me for the first time said: ""I am blown away. It sounds EXACT to what I heard (of the same performance) at The Met in Lincoln Center a week ago"". The sound is real. It is no compromise, actual orchestra sound if you have a system that is capable of reproducing it.
Highly recommended as either a performance piece, or a home theater demonstration disk. Thank goodness for these companies that are keeping classical music and performances alive ! That and producing stunning video and audio that is realistic, not ""hi-fi"" sound.
One last thing: the ""crypt"" scene is a hard watch, it is so emotionally powerful.",1372291200,3,1304,4.748898678414097
3915124,4,B002E2M5NW,"I've seen many versions of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in films, ballet and opera.

3915125,5,B002E2M5NW,This is such a marvelous production of this ballet.  Both principals were outstanding and the choreography was superb.  Would highly recommend this to ballet lovers. You won't be disppointed.,1359331200,,191,5.551724137931035
3915126,5,B002E2M5NW,"Those of you trying to decide among the R&J's available could do no better than this performance. All the principals dance beautifully as do the rest of the ""corps de ballet"". The final scene is captivating as is the balcony scene, though I believe the "" Romeo parting scene"" is actually one for the ages. All the emotion one would expect this scene to produce Acosta and Rojo deliver in spades. I thoroughly enjoyed this R&J and believe you will too. I own the Nureyev/Fonteyn and the Ferri/Eagling R&J's but will more than likely revisit this Acosta/Rojo more often. Another bonus is that it's filmed in today's modern picture and sound capabilities, great on HD TV's.",1355788800,2,670,4.7844827586206895
3915127,5,B002E2M5NW,"It seems appropriate to start this assessment by quoting three newspaper summaries as follows:

`Tamara Rojo and Carlos Acosta ... Absolutely gleam with greatness' (Daily Telegraph)
`Acosta ... dances with stunning power' (Financial Times)
`Rojo's portrait of Juliet is gorgeously, movingly, thrillingly shaped' (Sunday Times)

......................

There are now two recent recordings available of this ballet, both made by the Royal Ballet. The newest disc, recorded in March 2012, comes into the most direct competition possible with this previous recording listed here. This earlier recording was made in November 2007 by Decca, also at the Royal Ballet with the same production but with a different cast and a Russian conductor.

One might be forgiven for being rather confused at this stage as it seems that the two recordings will double up so closely as to be an unnecessary duplication. In reality they are very different performances with a completely different emotional effect almost throughout. Both are described in the course of this review as follows:

Individual timings of various sections are an indication of the different approaches to the interpretation. In the earlier version starring Acosta and Rojo with Boris Gruzin conducting tempi are noticeably faster with tauter movements in many sections (such as in the crowd scenes or the sword fights) than in the new version with Federico Bonelli and Lauren Cuthbertson starring with Barry Wordsworth conducting. Some of the gentler sections can be startlingly different too such as Juliet's dance in act 1 taking just 2'20'' with Rojo compared to just over 3 minutes with Cuthbertson for instance. The ensemble pieces with their slower speeds in particular have completely different effects. The market scenes in the earlier version have an unmistakable sense of menace, the harlots' dance has an aggressive edge, the dance of the knights (Capulets) is clearly a demonstration of menacing power on the earlier version while the new version is more of a measured demonstration of stateliness.

This difference of interpretation between the two performances is apparent throughout and equally applies to the main characters, Romeo and Juliet. Acosta is all about strength and power and he is matched by Rojo's apparent fragility. This creates a dramatic tension which matches the palpable menace that permeates the whole of the earlier performance. The harlots are aggressive, the fight scenes are hair-raising in their intense determination to inflict death. Interestingly, Christopher Saunders appearing in both versions, is more aggressive as Lord Capulet towards Juliet in the bedroom scenes in act 3 than he is in the same role in the new version. Thiago Soares as Tybalt is extraordinarily cold-bloodied and vicious in the earlier production and his actual physical appearance and general demeanour is in a completely different league compared to the more socially acceptable and simply unpleasant characterisation of Bennet Gartside in this new version. Everything about the earlier version is on a more epic scale. This also applies to Rojo's apparent fragility as a naive and very young girl and her ultimate final strength as she takes the sleeping draught and then finally stabs herself and dies. She is visibly moved and struggles to hold back the tears at the following curtain calls and Acosta has to comfort her. It takes her a while to compose herself.

In the new production from 2012 there is a gentler and more lyrical approach to the whole ballet. This is not just a question of generally slower speeds. The emphasis is on smoother phrasing within the orchestra and a greater emphasis on the sweeping string textures rather than edgy brass which are kept more tonally blended. In the earlier version the phrasing is more aggressive with harsher accenting and with the brass far more prominent and biting in their tonal projection. On stage, the ensemble market scenes are more good humoured here with the harlots less aggressively dominant towards Romeo and his friends and the responses from the other girls less angry or defensive of their propriety. Mercutio's taunting, fight and ultimate death at the hands of Tybalt is more about taunting gone wrong rather than built-in hatred. Lady Capulet shows plenty of grief here but the earlier version is more literally hand-wringing because of the greater level of previous violence and its consequence. Both Federico Bonelli and Lauren Cuthbertson give excellent portrayals of their respective roles but this is very much girl meets boy next door. He is clearly a gentle soul with not an ounce of aggression in him. She is a bonny and healthy young English girl/woman with the added experience of being more than a teenager, more socially aware, less of a naive victim figure and not at all fragile. Both he and she are all smiles and immediately happy at the final curtain calls and there is clearly no need for comfort!

The new booklet has a telling comment from a member of the Technical Department which sums it all up and I quote: 'The Russian conductors go at it like mad things. It does sound better, but you feel ""Slow down a bit""-because there's a hell of a lot to do.'

In the Acosta and Rojo earlier version, everything is on an epic scale both emotionally and physically. This applies to absolutely everything from the two stars, the supporting characters, the ensembles and corps de ballet and, possibly most importantly, from the driven and very Russian view of the conductor, Boris Gruzin. This is a drama of inevitable high tragedy which could never have gone right given the total lack of understanding at every level.

In the newer version with Bonelli and Cuthbertson everything is on a more normal girl meets boy next door scale both emotionally and physically. This equally applies to the supporting characters, the ensembles and corps de ballet and, probably crucially, from the more lyrical and less dramatic view of the conductor, Barry Wordsworth. This is a potentially happy story of the love between two young people which goes tragically wrong but could perhaps have been avoided given more understanding and social counselling, and I don't mean to be trite. This is very much a tale related to our own times where hope for a happy ending is never quite banished until the final act. One is left with the feeling of 'If only but ....'

Both discs are well recorded with sharp HD definition in both imaging and DTS-Master Audio sound. The camera work in both cases is excellent and fully supports the action on stage. The new disc supplies two short documentaries about the fight scenes (4 minutes) and about Kenneth MacMillan (8 minutes). There is also the usual Opus Arte cast gallery. The Decca disc does not have any extras.

This then is a choice between two quite different versions which are not as similar as one might expect. Both are equally well danced, recorded and played. The dramatic intent is the difference and this pervades both performances completely.

Supporters of the main stars will surely choose the version that they relate to on that basis. So will those who attended the performances either on stage or on screen. The audiences at the conclusion of both discs were equally ecstatic.

I would suggest that potential purchasers who do not relate directly to either cast would be best advised to consider which type of story they favour - a drama of hatred and aggression overcoming all or girl meets boy with a not quite inevitable tragic ending. Both of these options are equally well done on these two discs but they are not the same by any means.

In conclusion. these are two equally good discs but a reviewer can only give clues as to the differences between them. I would not presume to go further with advice as this will so obviously be a matter of personal responses to the individual dancers and to the type of story preferred. Everything else is equally matched.",1341792000,12,7967,5.029567854435178
3915128,5,B002E2M5NW,"Excellent sound and video. A very pleasent experience and if one is a balletomane
or even a ballet teacher you must watch these dancers in this staging of this classic. No other professional ballet company can surpass this Romeo and Juliet by the Royal Ballet. Often, during my viewing, Nureyev and Fonteyn came to my mind, whom I saw performed this same ballet in 1968 or 69 in Los Angeles, California. Although this new staging has less overacting, it is still a powerful performance. I recommend it. One note: Juliet's scene waiting sitting on her bed to see Friar Lawrence before the poison is still Margot Fonteyn's as well as the running down from her balcony to meet Romeo. She was the best!!",1325203200,,699,4.691056910569106
3915129,2,B002E2M5NW,"Great music performed A+.  However, the ballet needs a lot more rehearsal.  I have never seen a ballet, even in rehearsals, that was so far apart in routines.  No synchronized swimming here!  Near the end it gets somewhat better.  The conductor struggles adjusting tempos to help pull it together but to no avail.  Worth the purchase for the music as there are some nuances in the brass that bring out lines normally not so well in focus.",1313366400,4,438,4.623376623376624
3915130,5,B002E2M5NW,"Ok, this is one beautiful DVD. The production values are of the highest caliber, the photography, editing and, of course, ballet itself, are all top notch. Although a little long, this is a thoroughly engrossing ballet with beautiful and highly professional performances.",1302048000,2,271,5.476190476190476
3915131,3,B002E2M5NW,"I know I am in the minority here but I find this ballet disappointing.  The music is beautiful and well performed.  The sound quality is excellent.  The lighting, costumes and other production standards are high. Acosta as Romeo was not to my liking. He is a large, heavily muscled man and thus to me not very graceful.  I find the music to this Romeo and Juliet much more exciting than watching the ballet.  This is a long production and much of the staging and dancing seemed forced to fit the music.  Again just one person's opinion.",1295913600,11,536,4.53125
3915132,4,B002E2M5NW,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a marvellous overall production but prefer Angel Corella's Romeo to that of Acosta's.  Corella's youthful enthusiasm and joyful exuberance are, to me, more believable than Acosta's more mature approach.  Both are superb dancers--Acosta's interpretation of Franz in Coppelia (available on DVD) is wonderful, but the award for Romeo must go to Corella.  I thought Rojo's Juliet was sublime but, again, not quite as polished as Ferri's.  There were subtle nuances in Ferri's performance that were missing in Rojo's, such as the palpably painful arc of her body when she faces Romeo at the beginning of the bedroom scene--not a huge move but one that speaks volumes. The balcony scene with Corella and Ferri moved me to chills and tears while Acosta and Rojo, though beautiful and passionate, did not.

The BIG difference in the productions, though, is costuming.  La Scala's costumes are superb.  Juliet's costume in act I is just gorgeous and flows with her every movement.  The costumes for the ballroom scene are brilliant and exhibit such creative use of color (Juliet's is a deep gold--stunning!).  The lighting, too, is brighter and has none of the dark, murky tones of the Royal Ballet production.  Although the Royal Ballet's lighting is probably more authentic,the La Scala production is certainly easier to see (something to consider when a production is being filmed).

In all, both productions are worthy of praise, both are valuable additions to ons's ballet library, but this reviewer prefers the La Scala production.",1275177600,13,1574,5.15748031496063

It was the trailer for this DVD that made me want to watch it. And I am very glad that it is now part of my ballet DVD collection.

Anger. Hate. Despair. Passion. Love. Confusion. That is what this beloved story is all about. And the Royal Ballet, led by the star pair of Tamara Rojo and Carlos Acosta, capture that exactly.

Tamaras Juliet is delicate, frail, beautiful. Carloss Romeo is headstrong, handsome, protective. Together, they make the two young lovers instantly spring to life.

Thiago Soares as Tybalt is unmercilessly cruel and spiteful, Jose Martins Mercutio is playful and mischievous, Yohei Sasakis Benvolio is full of spirit. Christopher Saunders Lord Capulet is haughty and proud, Elizabeth McGorians Lady Capulet is sweet at times, frigid the next. The rest of the cast is excellent as well in their acting abilities.

Favorite parts of mine include:

- Tamara and Carlos dancing/acting, especially in the Bedroom pas de deux. No wonder they are both principal dancers today.

- The pas de trois between Romeo, Mercutio, and Benvolio before they enter the Capulets party. I love the music there and the dancers do seem like true friends.

- Elizabeth McGorians acting as Lady Capulet when Tybalt is killed. When she first looks at Romeo, her expression made me break out sweating. She almost reminded me of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings.

Add this DVD to your collection. Or better, start with it! The performance is outstanding and you won't find a more dramatic version than this.",1450051200,,1584,4.858736059479554

8366734,5,B002E2M5NW,"This version of Romeo and Juliet is a perfect synergy of ballet and drama, not as a single element of brilliant dancing or brilliant miming. Thus, you may not like it if you are looking for excellent dancing alone or excellent acting.

The chemistry between Acosta and Rojo is superb; their partnership portrays the essence of forbidden, tragic love that is Romeo and Juliet. As an individual, Rojo interprets the role of Juliet extremely well. A little, naive girl captured by tragic circumstances and forced to ""mature into a woman"". This also applies to Acosta, as one watches the ballet, one sees Romeo, a man who is driven by love to use all his wits and wisdom to obtain just 1 more minute with the woman of his life. Thus, 5 out of 5 stars for the 2 principal dancers here.

The Corps de Ballet shines brightly as well in this piece. The other characters through their dancing as well as acting, really portray the bitter and bloody rivalry that exists between the 2 families and thereby providing the necessary background for the 2 principal dancers.

In conclusion, a 5 out of 5 score!",1376611200,2,1094,4.628865979381444
