Hannah Montana - Super (Stitious) Girl

I only bought this DVD because of the Wizard of Waverly Place episode, though I do like Suite Life on Deck too.

I'm a fan of Wizards and I am glad they were part of this crossover. However, it didn't grab my interest enough to watch it over and over again. It's a show good enough to watch once in a while, but that's for me. If you love it, awesome. That is what truly counts. :)",1255651200,,444,4.36144578313253
3914130,4,B002DYKPEW,"In 2009, the Disney Channel featured a crossover trilogy featuring their top sitcoms ""Wizards of Waverly Place"", ""The Suite Life"" on Deck"" and ""Hannah Montana"".  Needless to say, this rare crossover was a big ratings winner for Disney as over 9.3 million viewers tuned into the crossover episodes. And now, all three episodes are featured on DVD with ""Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana"".

Here is a listing of the episodes featured on the DVD and brief summary of the episode:

  * Wizards of Waverly Place - Episode 25: Part 1 - Cast-Away (To Another Show) - In this episode, Justin wins a contest for a teenage cruise to meet London Tipton.  Excited about the contest and excited about meeting London, Justin's sister Alex and Max come along.  But with Alex, due to her missing homework, she is expected to study on the ship so Alex comes up with an idea: To bring Harper along and have her pretend she's Alex, while she has fun with Bailey and uses the alias Ashley Olsen.  Meanwhile, Max finds a rival on the cruise, Zach Martin.  Meanwhile, Justin meets London but pretends he's a doctor.  This episode features a crossover with the characters of ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" and ""Suite Life on Deck"".
  * The Suite Life on Deck - Episode 21: Part 2 - Double Crossed - Hannah Montana is going to perform on the SS Tipton and Cody tries to impress Bailey by trying to get tickets (despite the concert being sold out).  Meanwhile, someone turns Justin blue and Mr. Moseby thinks its Zack, while Justin thinks its his sister Alex.  This episode features a crossover of characters from all three shows.
  * Hannah Montana - Episode 19: Part 3 - Super(stitious) Girl - Miley, her father Robby Ray and Lilly are onboard the SS Tipton for her concert.  But Miley has a setback when she loses her deceased mom's anklet and Miley doesn't think she could perform as Hannah Montana without it.  Meanwhile back at home, Jackson, Oliver and Rico open a package meant for Robby.  This episode features a crossover of ""Hannah Montana"" and ""The Suite Life on Deck"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana"" is presented in Full Screen (1:33:1) and is presented in Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  For the most part, picture quality is better than the broadcast.  Everything was good, although a segment in the ""Hannah Montana"" episode during a scene which involved Jackson and friends, picture quality looked quite blurry.  But for the most part, all three episodes look good on DVD.  As for audio, audio is clear and understandable.  Personally, I found it much more appealing to have the audio on my receiver set for stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana"" comes with the following special features:

  * Bonus Short: Justin's Award-Winning Essay - (3:33) Watch the essay video that got Justin and his siblings on the S.S. TIPTON Teen Cruise!
  * It's A Suite Life Having Fun With Hannah & The Wizards - (5:42) Hilarious bloopers and backstage interviews with the stars!
  * Dylan & Cole Sprouse: Blu-Ray is Suite - (4:45) A featurette about Blu-ray and High Definition.
  * Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go - (1:03) A Featurette explaining what a Disney Digital Copy is.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For Disney Channel fans of the original sitcoms ""Wizards of Waverly Place"", ""Suite Life on Deck"" and ""Hannah Montana"", to see a crossover with the three shows is quite rare and exciting for the fans. Well, technically the only episode to feature characters from all three shows is in the second episode ""Double Crossed"" and for some reason, the cast of the ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" and ""Hannah Montana"" do not interact in any of the episodes.  Nevertheless, the storylines do tie the characters of each show together.

For the most part, fans of the three-episode crossover can't find anything wrong with this release.  For the most part, all episodes are quite entertaining, hilarious and family friendly.  I watched the DVD along with my son who enjoyed the crossover when it first aired on television and was excited to see it all over again.

As for the crossover episodes, I did feel that Brenda Song's character London Tipton (""Suite Life on Deck"") was a bit too uncaring and self-centered in the special crossover episodes, especially on the ""Hannah Montana"" crossover episode.  But there were a good number of enjoyable scenes throughout the three episodes.  I found it interesting to see Bailey and Alex hanging out, Justin and London on a date, Zack and Max square off against each other, Cody and Harper enjoying their intellectual side of each other and more.  Also, for ""Suite Life on Deck"" fans who wanted to see Cody and Bailey grow closer, those fans get to see how it all happens.

The added bonus features on the DVD was a nice touch but I wish they were much longer but for the most part, fans of this special crossover will be entertained by them.

Overall, ""Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana"" was a fun, entertaining and hilarious DVD.  Each crossover episode is fun for the entire family and for fans of each series series, overall this DVD release is quite solid.  Definitely check it it out!",1255392000,17,5221,4.757238307349666
3914131,3,B002DYKPEW,"Fans of 60's television probably remember when characters from one series would ""crossover"" to another show, usually produced by or at the same studio. Morey Amsterdam appeared in his ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" character of Buddy Sorrell on an episode of The Danny Thomas Show. The casts of ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Petticoat Junction"" and ""Green Acres"" often popped up on each other's shows. Rhoda called Mary Richards on her show. It's kind of a TV tradition (or gimmick, depending on whether your glass is half full or empty).

The Disney Channel sitcom characters have been doing this sort of thing for years, but probably never as elaborately in ""Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana,"" which are basically three half-hour episodes that connect with each other: a winning essay lands the Russo teens on the S.S. Tipton, where Hannah Montana is having a concert. It all comes together rather well, considering how many behind-the-scenes intrigues and approvals it may have involved (all three shows have different productions companies and crews even though they're all original Disney Channel series).

For fans, it's the stuff dreams are made of -- ""Wow! Justin is meeting London as if she's a celebrity, and we all know how ditzy she is!"" ""Wow! Miley and Selena in one show!,"" etc. There's an interesting short bonus feature about the making of the trilogy with a selection of amusing bloopers, as well as a short feature called ""How to Write an Essay,"" a tongue-in-cheek look at the writing process narrated by David ""Justin"" Henrie.

It might have been nice to have one or two bonus episodes, since all we get here are a total of three. It also might have been interesting to see how the episodes might have been edited together as if they were a feature/ But it's a convenient way to have the crossover ""event,"" as it were.

As a note for those who like to keep track of these things, the three episodes are:  ""Castaway (to Another Show);"" ""Double Crazed"" and ""Super(stitious) Girl."" And as a further note, this is the first Disney DVD I can recall that does not open with Captain Jack Depp saying, ""We have our heading"" leading to a promo for Blu-Ray.",1254268800,9,2157,4.803234501347709
3914132,5,B002DYKPEW,"As much as I hate to admit it, these shows are very appealing and keep me coming back to Disney Channel. I'm a guy and will become 18 next summer, I always believed that Disney Channel was for kids and will always remain a kids show. However Disney Channel shows have become more appealing and actually pretty funny once in a while. Selena Gomez was my main attraction to Wizards of Waverly Place (big crush, as with many guys probably) but overtime, I've grown to love the show in its entirety loving all the characters, plot and the pretty mature humor sometimes, and that goes the same for Suite Life on Deck and Hannah Montana, although the audience is aimed for kids, there is some appealing moments in the show that can grasp the teenagers and young adults into the show. When I heard that they were doing a 3-show crossover, I actually WANTED to see it, not just watch cuz it was on TV on a random day. The 3-show special actually ended up being a highlight of the summer for me as far as watching TV was concerned, I loved it. The script of this special was very well written, they have managed to include all the main characters from each show and naturally had all of them to collide with one another so fluidly. I was very impressed, Disney Channel is managing not to only attract kids from the ages of 8-14 but also 16-20 maybe even older, as far as I am concerned this DVD is a buy.

Part 1: Cast-Away (To Another Show)
Parts 1 & 2 are my favorite of the crossover specials. Suite Life and Wizards of Waverly Place are my favorite shows on Disney as of now. This is the Wizards part of the crossover, Justin wins a contest on a free Teen cruise shop to Hawaii on the S.S.Tipton and gets to meet London Tipton (Brenda Song, another crush of mine). Alex, Max & Harper go onboard as well cause some crazy antics with the Suite Life cast. This episode was a strong start and the humor in this episode is actually pretty hilarious. 9/10

Part 2: Double Crossed
This would be considered the Suite Life part of the show, but you won't be able to tell the difference since the characters from part 2 are basically the same from part 1. This episode introduces Hannah Montana to the party of stars and emphasizes the relationship between Cody and Bailey (Debby Ryan, haha another cutie) and fans of their relationship will LOVE this episode. The chemistry between Selena Gomez and Dylan Sprouse in this episode is actually pretty funny, Zack tries to impress Alex and Alex strays away, classic stalker-like humor. Just a note, this is the only episode that features ALL of the shows stars in ONE episode, pretty cool. 10/10

Part 3: Super(sticious) Girl
This is the Hannah Montana arc and my least favorite arc of the trilogy. This part features none of the Wizards cast and I think that was the problem, but theres more. The Hannah Montana arc is not very funny at all, I guess the writers were getting tired from the previous 2 parts and just made up this part of the story last minute or sumthin. Again, Hannah Montana is starting to get really old, the humor was pretty stail and the characters from the Suite Life and Hannah Montana barely collided with one another and that was the problem. For a crossover to be successful, the characters from each show are supposed to interact with each other most of the time, and since they didn't, it just felt like another Hannah Montana episode that randomly features the cast from Suite Life on Deck. The only thing that saves this part of the special is the elavated relationship between Bailey and Cody. But other than that, it was terrible, just skip this part. 4/10",1253318400,12,3621,4.483333333333333
3914133,5,B002DYKPEW,"Disney has pulled off a miracle with the 90-minute TV Special, Wizards on Deck With Hannah Montana. I would highly recommend it to any fan of any of these 3 shows. It begins with Wizards of Waverly Place. Justin Russo wins an essay contest and a free cruise on the S.S. Tipton. He also is trying to get a date with London Tipton, but the things he has to do to impress her are hilarious! Max Russo challenges Zack Martin (from The Suite Life On Deck) to some hilarious challenges. And Alex Russo tries to convince her parents to let her stay on board. But she tries to sneak out of a class with help of her friend Harper.

Part 2: Begins With The Suite Life on Deck. Bailey Pickett tells Cody Martin that a famous person is coming onboard the ship. And after many hilarious guesses from him and his friend Woody, we find out that Hannah Montana is going to board, In an effort to impress Bailey and finally win her over (If you have seen this show, you know what i'm talking about.), he tells her that he is great friends with her because she ate cake off his brother's shirt.(you see this in Thats So Suite Life Of Hannah Montana), and he promises Bailey that he can get them tickets to her concert in Hawaii. After asking Hannah himself(shell remember him later in the show after an incident with cody and woody), Trying to win tickets in a scavenger hunt,(Zack causes him to lose after tackling him for putting dye in a hot tub and framing him. It wasn't him, it was Alex Russo, Which Zack has a huge crush on.) he finnaly gets tickets. (I'm not revealing how, but if you have been following the Cody/Bailey romance angle on the show, you finally know the answer in this chapter.

Part 3: Begins with Hannah Montana. Hannah loses her lucky anklet given to her by her mother. She believes that the anklet has lucky powers, but when they find it, the clumsy London Tipton throws it overboard after Hannah tells her that the diamonds are fake. Everything goes wrong for Hannah after that, from having the worst rehersal ever, having a rat on her head, Losing her wig, Trying to dye her hair blonde and turning it green, breaking a mirror. Shes finally uplifted by Robby Ray. Meanwhile, Jackson, Oliver, and Rico stay at home and open a package for Robby Ray (He knows Jackson will try to open it, so he orders a little surprise for them.) Hannah does the Concert and everything turns out okay. This is one of the best specials that Disney has ever made. I would recommend it to anybody.",1249689600,,2486,4.413943355119826
