1102404,5,6305958165,"As I watched Model Behavior, I found a fun new way to watch The Prince and the Pauper, through the eyes of two complete different teenagers.  With Justin Timberlake, this movie was fun for any teenager to see.  The actors  were real and easy to relate to and the movie seemed real, especially when  the views of real life for different teenagers was added.  I would like to  see this movie again, if only for the sheer pleasure of it.  I really think  that this movie would be worth the time to watch, and definitely worth the  money to own it, to see it over and over again.",961891200,3,575,4.25

1102480,5,6305958165,I used to watch this all the time as a kid! Definitely a good movie dealing with teen issues & supermodel hype. I wish Disney would convert this to DVD! This is a really good movie!,1294531200,14,181,4.055555555555555
1102481,4,6305958165,This movie is so much fun. I love the way she played girls who looked alike but just totally different. It was very fun and cool in so many ways. Justin did a great job in this film.,1294444800,,182,3.8157894736842106
1102482,5,6305958165,Yes it was a cute movie!! I'd like to own it ! So bring it to DVD!!!!!!!,1213228800,2,72,3.2941176470588234
1102483,5,6305958165,"I really enjoyed this movie. Altogether, it's not bad -- nowhere half as bad as some people claim. Very interesting version of ""The Prince and the Pauper"", with a modern New York City twist. It's cool to see Janine and Alex try to live each other's lives, which produces very entertaining results. It's especially cool to see Justin Timberlake in there. I sure wish they had given him more screen time, but then again, he's not the central character.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend that you do. I know a lot of people think this is a crummy movie, but hey, not everyone likes the same things. We all have different tastes. We all have our likes, and our dislikes. I suggest you watch this movie (all the way) at least once before you make your final opinion.",1210723200,,776,4.464788732394366
1102484,5,6305958165,"I thought it was great! It was cute, and made me cry, even though the story line was not all that believable or realistic, who wants to watch a movie that resembles real life? I may as well be watching my own neighbours. Fabulous job!",1142380800,,234,4.222222222222222
1102485,5,6305958165,"This is a very entertaining movie with fun characters and a good storyline.  Alex and Janine are similar to the characters played by Mary-Kate and Ashley in multiple movies.  One is a wall flower and day dreamer, while the other is outgoing and not afraid to sya what's on her mind.  It is interesting to watch the two adusting to each other's lifestyles.  I also discovered that Justin Timberlake is a very good actor!  Why isn't he in more movies?  Anyway, the other actors are well-cast, and play their parts well.  The school snob got on my nerves, and Janine's organizer/slave made me want to smile.  I was very surprised to see that this movie is buyable!  But I'd rather just watch it when it comes on the Disney Channel.  When it does come on, I warn you, DON'T TURN IT ON OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TURN IT OFF UNTIL THE END!",1106438400,9,831,4.337662337662338
1102486,4,6305958165,Justin Timberlake in his very first movie..He was still at nsync when he made this movie for disney. In this movie he proves that hes not just a pretty boy who knows how to sing but he knows how to act too..well considering singers who went to act...only a few of them survived..This is actually a pretty good disney movie...recomended for the young fans and those who are young at heart as well..,1101081600,3,397,4.4520547945205475
1102537,5,6305958165,this is one of my favorite movies of all time and justin is a great actor besides longshot and some other movies but i think everyone who played in this movie was great. and also the girl who plays both parts she is one hot women but anyways everyone had a good role play in this movie and we should have dvd out whenever they decide to get around to it. i have a ton of vhs tapes but have a ton of dvd's  and also thinking about switching my other vhs tapes to dvd. so far i did with space jam and some of my nsync tapes. dvd has such great quality. but we need a dvd soon. or whenever they get around to it. it would be a good idea though.,1085875200,2,641,3.819548872180451

After seeing that, I want to buy DVD. But it's a pity that it isn't published. I can't see VHS, and furthermore it isn't sold in Taiwan. Buy it here? The freight is too high... I really hope one day the DVD of it will be published in Taiwan.

1102539,5,6305958165,"I saw the ending of this movie on tv the other day, and I really wanted to see all of it, so I bought it!  I thought it was a really sweet movie, I would recommend it to all ages and sexes.  Justin Timberlake also did a great job for his movie debut (not to mention he looks great aswell!)  It sends out the message that looks can be decieving!  I thought this was a great movie!  It's got a bit of the Parent Trap vibe going on, but I would highly recommend it!",1061424000,,462,3.872340425531915
1102540,2,6305958165,"Okay, I have to admit that I originally watched ""Model Behavior"" on television because I knew Justin Timberlake was going to be in it. From the first minute of the film, I realized that I should have just left the movie alone and watched something else.
This movie revolves around the tale of The Prince and Pauper. There are two girls who magically are identical, but have never met one another or heard of the other. Somehow they encounter and switch lives for awhile. That would be all fine and good for a Disney movie, but then Kathie Lee Gifford and Justin Timberlake come into play.
Even though I'm a fan of Timberlake's, I think his performance in this movie was terrible. Maybe it was because it was his first real role in a film, but all of his lines seemed stiff and forced. He came off like he was trying to ""act"" instead of just doing what came naturally. Watching him in his role as a supermodel who's infatuated with the female leads in the film became very painful after awhile. Kathie Lee Gifford's role suited her, but again, she seemed like she was forcing it too much.
Overall, I guess this film could be okay for typical Disney audiences because it teaches you a good lesson at the end and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the acting and casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired.",1054771200,,1317,4.468879668049793

1102575,1,6305958165,"I am not a teenybopper, I just watched this movie on the Disney Channel, I tuned in late, and I have still yet to completely comprehend the movie.  I don't understand how realistically you can resemble a supermodel enough to trade places with them, or how you can even meet them to begin with.  It's not like supermodels like Tyra Banks, Kate Moss or Cindy Crawford spend their free time wandering around with the little people.  Justin Timberlake is just a pretty face in this movie, but it does showcase his marginal acting talent.  It's good for the whole family, but I would highly recommend other equally family- oriented movies by Disney with somewhat better plots.  Try something like Johnny Tsunami or The Parent Trap.",1016236800,,726,4.776
1102576,3,6305958165,"it was ok. I got this movie because the idea of Justin Timberlake acting was quite comical, but it was actually ok. It had a cute, if unoriginal plot, and the actors were pretty good.  Not bad Justin.",1014422400,,200,4.2631578947368425

1102579,5,6305958165,"Being an anti-fan of *N SYNC, I was a little skeptical about watching MODEL BEHAVIOR, since I knew Justin Timberlake starred in the film and I absolutely HATE Justin! But I watched it when it aired on ""The Wonderful World Of Disney"" anyway and at the end, really enjoyed it! Really - you don't even have to be an *N SYNC fan to enjoy this movie. He doesn't even really have a major part in it. The only reason why people think Justin is one of the main stars of the movie is because he's one of the most famous cast-members. But really, he just co-stars in the movie.
This movie is about two very different, but look-alike teenagers. Alex (Maggie Lawson), is your average high school teen who has trouble fitting in and gets nervous whenever she's around her crush. She is also serious about her schoolwork. Jeanie (also Maggie Lawson) is NOT your average teen because she is a world-famous super model, secretly wishing that she could be just like all her other peers. The two meet at this restaurant where Alex's father is catering (with Alex helping) a party or something and Jeanie makes a special appearence. They discover that they look exactly alike and decide to switch places for a week so they can discover what each other's lives are like. Of course, no one knows that they switched places. Things are going smoothly until another teen super model, Jason (Justin Timberlake), asks Alex out thinking that she is really Jeanie. And then, Alex's high school crush, Eric (Jesse Nilsson) asks Jeanie out on a date thinking that she is Alex. While on their dates, the girls end up going to the same restaurant and Jeanie is being followed (and video-taped) by Alex's pesky little brother, Josh (Daniel Clark), who believes the girl who's living with his family isn't Alex.
MODEL BEHAVIOR has a good, strong and complicated plot (though people will still say it's just ""your average teen flick""). It's funny at some parts and the acting (for the most part, excluding Justin Timberlake) is good, solid, and strong. Also co-starring in this movie is Kathie Lee Gilford who play's Jeanie's stage mother and Cody Gilford (Kathie Lee Gilford's real-life son), who plays Jeanie's spoiled-brat little brother. This movie is very fun to watch, though it's definitely a guilty pleasure film. Buy it today!",998265600,4,2300,4.7669172932330826
1102580,2,6305958165,"I'll have to admit, this movie is a sort of guilty pleasure.  You realize from the beginning how incredibly cheesy and terrible the acting is, yet you can't seem to change the channel.  Sure, Justin is ""so dreamy"" but he can't act worth anything.  During some serious parts of the movie I found myself laughing simply because his acting was so terrible.  So if you're looking for brainless fun, watch this.  But if you're looking for something insightful, watch ""Proust in Love"" or something.",995760000,,492,4.809523809523809
1102581,5,6305958165,this movie was great i saw it on the disney channel when it first came out and i taped it Justin Timberlake looks so fine in that movie and is a very good actor everone should see this movie.  Its about 2 girls who don't like what there life is like one is a stubborn super model named genine adams and the other is an average girl named alex something i forget the name anywaysalex is someone who gets picked on alot and stuff.. anyways one day at her father restaurant genine is signing autographs and stuff and she goes to get something to eat and bumps into alex and realizes how much they look alike so the decide to trade lives .. for a while everything was good until alex fall in love w/ another model named jason sharp ( justin ) and genine don't want her to like him and genine fall for the high school jock..its really messed up when justin find alex talking to the jock guy i cant remember his name while jason is kissing her the jock sees alex and thinks she wascheating on him and both guys get mad .. and then there is a ball and genine and alex are sad becuz the jock is w/ some girl and jason didn't come and then everything changes around i cant really explain it but you got to see this movie...,994032000,2,1214,4.122362869198312

So I just had to get it, because I fell in love with the movie when I first saw it.

1102645,5,6305958165,"I really enjoyed MODEL BEHAVIOR. But the only problem I saw with this movie was Justin Timberlake. This movie would've been a whole heck of a lot better without him! Sorry, 'N Sync obsessive fans, but Justin can't act at all...much less sing (he's got a horrible, whiny voice) and he's ugly. And I just think the only reason he decided to do this movie was to up-grade the 'N Sync craze (I absolutely hate 'N Sync).
MODEL BEHAVIOR is about these two look-alike but different teenage girls named Janie and Alex. Alex is your average every-day high school girl while Janie is a supermodel! The two of them meet at Alex's father's restuarant where Janie is holding a special appearence when they realize how much they look alike. To discover what the other's life is like, the two of them switch places and Janie pretends to be Alex while Alex pretends to be Janie. Things are going smoothly until the real Alex gets asked out by another supermodel, Jason (Justin Timberlake), because he thinks that she is Janie and Alex's high school crush, Josh, asks Janie out thinking that she is Alex! When it's time for Alex's school prom, things start to get even more messed up when Jason finds Janie talking to Josh even though she is really Alex!
The movie also stars Maggie Lawson who plays a double-role as Alex and Janie and also co-stars Kathie Lee Gilford, who plays Janie's stage-mother, and Kathie Lee Gilford's real-life son, Cody Gilford, who plays Janie's bratty, stuck-up brother.
Great, fun movie but could've been better without Justin Timberlake! I recommend it even if you're not a fan of 'N Sync.",987638400,,1603,4.708185053380783

When I watched it, I thought it wasn't going to be very good because I didn't think Justin Timberlake could act and I thought Disney was just trying to make some money off of the Nsync craze. But I was wrong. It was very clever and Justin did a good job, even though the lead, Maggie Lawson, stole the show. Alex is a nerdy girl who dosen't have much confidence. People are really mean to her and she wants to be a fashion designer. Genine is a famous super model who everybody loves and adores. Alex and Genine look exactly alike and are both having problems with their lives. So when they meet, they decide to trade places. It all goes good at first. Alex in Genines place falls in love with model Jason Sharp(Timberlake). Genine in Alex's place falls in love with the school jock. But when Alex's kid brother stumbles on to their secret, they are forced to swittch back. Can they keep their loves? This movie teaches people that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence. Rent it today.

1102648,4,6305958165,"So, I'm an adult that likes this move.  Branded a dork forlife, I am. ;)
Anyway, this movie is a cute, fun little thing towatch with your girlfriends when you all need to avoid reality forawhile and want to relive that whole ""puppy love"" thingagain.
It helps if you take the movie with a grain of salt. You'll laugh (and groan) your way through it, trust me.
The actingis pretty good.  It won't be winning anyone an Oscar, but ""madefor Disney TV"" movies rarely do that.  They're never meant to. Justin Timberlake's performance is good and shows that he has a lot oftalent and could do wonders when he's finally able to set aside sometime and work with a truly great script.  Maggie Lawson is refreshing,funny, and manages to give both of her characters an extra twist thatmakes them amusing (and not so over the top that you just -can't-suspend that disbelief).  The supporting cast does its job at addingmore amusing little elements to the movie that you won't catch thefirst time or two you see it.
To everyone who shunned this movie,called it a ""tween"" movie, or whatever, lighten up!  Be akid again and enjoy the movie for the delightful fluff it is.  It'smore fun to be young, anyway.
Yeah, the theme is cheesy, overdone,and has one of those happy endings that makes -everyone- want to groanand hurl things at the TV, but many of the 80's teen flicks that mostof us adults are -still- guilty of watching had the same over-the-tophappy endings.  Take it for what it is: A light-hearted movie thatisn't meant to win an Oscar.  Get together with some friends, get somedrinks going, pop it in and laugh at the cheesy lines, the sometimes-too- earnest acting, the general ""disney-ness"" of it all,and all those times you dreamed or -did- that same sort of stuff injr. high/high school.  You'll have a blast, trust me.
Side note: Themovie isn't worth [what] Amazon is retailing it at.  Try and catch itwhen it's airing on Disney so you can tape it, or search Amazon'smarketplace for discounted copies.",982195200,5,1999,4.731988472622478
1102649,5,6305958165,"This movie was really great. At first when I saw the storyline of the movie I thought it was going to be another Parent Trap movie, but it was totally different. The story is this. It's about 2 girls one a super model and the other a typical high school girl who are complete strangers to one another, and then they bump into each other at a party. Both of the girls are tired with their own lives and so they decide to switch places. At first it seems like a good idea and things are going as planned, but soon everything goes wrong and the whole twin switch thing is a complete disaster. In the end the two girls reveal to their family and friends about their switch when they bump into each other at the dance and soon their lives and problems are mended and everyone lives happily ever after. This movie was a fun and heartfelt movie. Kathie Lee Gifford does a superb job as the overprotective and overbearing mother of her supermodel daughter. Justin Timberlake is not only hot as the supermodel Jason Sharp, but he can really act. He is wonderful! I love this movie!

1102653,5,6305958165,"After seeing this once on the Wonderful World of Disney, money was no object, I knew I had to own this fabulous film.  The tale follows Alex Borroughs, (Maggie Lawson) a class geek trying to get up the nerve to ask out her crush and Jeanine Addams, (Lawson, again) a world famous super model launching a book and wishing she were  like everyone else. When the two bump into each other a a party Alex's father is catering, Jeanine has an idea: The girls look so much alike, they could switch place, in fact THEY DO switch places. Alex spends a week in the lap of luxury shopping and trying to be a model in NYC. (Even though she hates having her picture taken.) Meanwhile, Jeanine is enjoying the carefree teenage life, going on dates, hanging with Alex's friend and trying to be a student.  About mid-movie Jason Sharp( Teen heart-thob Justin Timberlake of *NSYNC) ask Alex (Who he thinks is Jeanine) on a date while back home Alex's crush asks Jeanine on a date with him. The problem? They all end up at the same restaurant, and Alex's pesky little brother follows Alex, believing correctly that she's not really Alex. There, Lawson and Lawson come face to face in the powder room and each switches again just for a moment to see how the other's date is going. Unfortunately kid brother Josh caught it all on tape and now has evidence enough to blackmail them both until eternity!
Over a course of time Alex as Jeanine loses one of Jeanine's designers because she ruins a dress and Jeanine as Alex ends up grounded for forgetting a catering event with her father. Som how do they resolve things? Get out the $100 you'll never regret spending!",976492800,4,1643,4.543918918918919
