7481173,5,B016YKZEKU,"Best Brazilian film of 2014 - a beautiful touching love story at the background of historic burlesque vaudeville's theater challenge to the then military dictatorship in the late 1970s. The acting is superb, and the backdrop of the gay sensibilities of the time is engrossing.  It is a pleasure to see a again a strong romantic hero performance from Jesuita Barbosa, fresh from his superb acting in the role of a younger brother in ""Futuro Beach"". He received a well-deserved Brazilian Oscar for his portraying of an army police recruit not well suited to fight the enemy.",1454803200,6,572,4.896907216494846
7481174,4,B016YKZEKU,"Set in the late 1970s 'Tatuagem' is a story of Clcio (Irandhir Santos Elite Squad) who runs what is described as an anarchist theatre club where they challenge the authority of the military dictatorship by putting on avant garde shows  basically lots of nudity and having fun. Star Paulette is sleeping with Clcio until his brother in law turns up. This is 18 year old soldier Fininho  the two hit it off immediately.

Meanwhile back at the barracks all is not as it seems with Fininho being bullied for not liking the ladies. There are also the side stories of the families and the ordinary ups and downs that add to highlight how much fun the theatre is  this is called The Star Spangled Floor and they describe it as the Studio 54 of the Favella! They also have a very inventive bent for making costumes  scanty  and props  check out the helmet made from a colander.

This is a very vibrant film with some good period detail and a lovely soundtrack with some notable performances too. It is not a mammoth sex fest but it does have some well realised bedroom scenes. It is also a film that will put a smile on your face and considering some of the subject matter here that is quite an achievement. This is one I rented but now intend to buy as its one I know I will get more out of on subsequent viewings.",1451088000,9,1307,4.349794238683128

8737545,1,B016YKZEKU,One of the worst film's in my collection. The acting and dialogue were so fake and pathetic. It was like a traveling sideshow except I wouldn't spend a dime watching such a stupid performance. I could not believe there was such a show.,1473724800,,235,4.488372093023256
