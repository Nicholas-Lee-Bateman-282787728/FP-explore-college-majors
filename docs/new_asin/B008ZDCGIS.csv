8532996,5,B008ZDCGIS,It's a great movie and I enjoyed it very much. One has to see it more than once to fully appreciate it. The quality of the transfer was relatively good. You can't go wrong with Joseph Cotten or Alida Valli.,1464307200,4,206,4.175

8532998,3,B008ZDCGIS,"Gorgeous cinematography, good direction and performances but a silly plot reflective of the Freudian psycho-babel of the times but well worth the viewing due to the moody, mysterious atmosphere this film evokes.",1361836800,5,211,5.625
