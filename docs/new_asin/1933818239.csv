7801823,5,1933818239,This video is my daughter's absolute favorite. She has been watching it since she was 12 months old. Our only complaint is that the Spoon and the Tap song are not long enough! We have really enjoyed this DVD. I'm betting your child will too.,1335657600,,241,4.377777777777778
7801824,5,1933818239,"We bought this video for our daughter who is 2, she loves it, it has several original songs and shows real children,animals and objects while the lyrics sing about what you are seeing, like ""a flower aflower a flower for my mom"", or ""let's count the chicks, one two three"".. also encourages the child watching to participate imitating what they are doing like, clapping, marching, playing with spoons or sticks. The lyrics are easy and simple and very catchy. Love it!.",1268265600,,469,4.802469135802469
