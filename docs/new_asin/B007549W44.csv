5055761,5,B007549W44,"When my husband started speaking fondly of old TV shows, at the top of his list was the FBI series. I did not think it was on DVD, but I checked Amazon one day, and was pleased to find it offered, just when I was looking for a gift for my husband.
He has been delighted to see the old shows, with scripts that stand the test of time. The ensemble cast drives episodes that are about good writing, understated acting, without the gimmicks and car chases of many of the more current dramas.

We now have two full seasons, and likely will add more. It has become part of our routine to watch an episode every night or two. If you remember the series, I need so no more. If you do not, you have missed a look at what the FBI used to be about - getting the bad guys.",1375315200,3,761,4.006578947368421
5055762,3,B007549W44,"I cannot understand why the F.B.I series gets so many five stars.
Admittedly the series has some good actors and decent scipts, but a lot of what I have seen lacks action.  But the most disappointing of all and what really ruins the watching is the terrible oversaturation of the Red and Blue colours. Surely Warner Bros must know this.

My first experience of this was when I bought the : FBI: Season One, Part One.  I thought then that it was just that set. I have today received - Part One, Second Season -  and that is just the same. Th actors faces are almost Orange in colour. All in all a terrible transfer, a pity because the picture transfer is sharp and the audio is good.

I definitely will not buy more, which is a pity because I liked the acting and actors of the era.",1356652800,,781,4.25
5055763,5,B007549W44,I watched this show from 1965 until it went off the air in the mid 1970's. Loved it then and just as good now.,1354579200,,110,3.625
5055764,5,B007549W44,"I LOVE looking into television's past to see how it has been shaped through the generations.  Living in a heavily digitised world today my work day is spent primarily in front of a computer screen, and whilst I appreciate the incredible capabilities of technology, it is sometimes nice to go home to television's past. ""The FBI"" is certainly one show that I have been enjoying immensely.  Both Amazon's CreateSpace and TV MOD technology bringing us the good fortune of reliving our old TV favourites is nothing short of spectacular.  BIG BRAVOS go out to all participating Studios and Amazon for enabling this to happen.

PS. Warner Archive Collection has just announced the availability of ""The FBI"" Third Season.  Great work guys!!!!",1347408000,6,735,5.041322314049586
5055765,5,B007549W44,"This is a great series to own, as there is lots of action and the episodes are fun to watch.  You will see many guest stars you recognize from the past making the ten most wanted list.  The price is kind of high, but what isn't these days.  Also to consider, lots of episodes.",1344384000,3,276,4.074074074074074
5055766,5,B007549W44,This show really brings back memories.  I remember sitting down as a family and watching The FBI...In Color!  These were good quality shows that you can never tire of watching.,1342569600,2,176,4.833333333333333
5055767,5,B007549W44,this is really great stuff efrem zimbalist jr. is a great actor the actors are excellent my favorite episode happens to be the scourge because it deals exacllay with la cosa nostra.,1338681600,,181,4.6875
5055768,3,B007549W44,"I can't understand how a classy TV show like this could get the treatment that it is getting. DVD-R release for such a show? It is really a disgrace and at the same high price that the original one's got. As much as I love this show I won't be getting these anytime soon, at least not until the price drops.",1334102400,17,307,4.049180327868853
5055779,5,B007549W44,"Just as I remember it. I received Season 1 in its entirety and Season 3 Part 1 as Christmas presents from family, so I filled in what was missing on my own. As I near the end of what I have on hand, I'll continue to order the series to its end. Brought back memories of Sunday nights, watching with my grandmother who, borrowing the vernacular of today, thought Efram Zimbalist Jr. was hot. I just enjoyed a good, solid, easy to watch, ensemble cast show. Watching this show today, I can see people who are major stars now who, in many cases were just starting out then. Wow, how far we've all come.
There's plenty of action to go around here. This isn't boring at all, as one reviewer wrote. But it may just not be for everyone. Enjoy.",1424649600,,736,4.264285714285714
5055780,5,B007549W44,"Grew up watching this series in the sixties and early seventies, just as great seeing it now on dvd as it was on live tv back then!!",1419984000,,132,3.925925925925926
5055781,5,B007549W44,I just finished watching the last ep last night. A great show. thank you.,1415145600,,73,4.285714285714286
5055782,5,B007549W44,"I THINK THESE EPISODES ARE LIKE THAT KELLOGG CEREAL GRR-EATTT!  I PERSONALLY DO NOT MIND PAYING A LITTLE

5055783,5,B007549W44,"Forgot how great this was and it is better now. The actors were excellent in this series, the stories true to life and so good to see clean shows without the sex and bad language",1405123200,,178,4.114285714285714
5055784,4,B007549W44,"I loved this show, growing up in the 1960's.  While it is great to see it available to a new generation, since nothing on TV today is as well written and acted, and also to see entertainment where moral values are upheld and the ""cops"" are still held in high esteem by the public at large, my one complaint is, the price is WAY too high, especially given that there are no special features( cast interviews, behind the scenes documentaries) and NO description of each episode's plot, or air date, on the inside of the slipcase. given that, again the price is too high. However, if you love cop shows from this period, you might find it worth your money.",1404950400,2,653,4.441666666666666
5055785,5,B007549W44,Fantastic series. Thanks for releasing it. I am looking forward to the others. One of the all time great quality programmes,1391817600,,123,4.904761904761905
5055786,5,B007549W44,"excellent tv series  the same 5 actors play all the bad guys in all episodes but it is very ""1960's-ish""",1389225600,,104,4.2
5055787,5,B007549W44,Some of my favorite episodes are with this season especially ESCAPE with Roy Thinnes and Marlyn Mason.  Don't hesitate to order this one.,1387929600,,137,4.956521739130435
5055788,5,B007549W44,This is a great show. Was then and is now. I intend to collect the entire series but I will do it one volume at a time. This way if there is anything wrong with any of the discs I don't get stuck with a dud.,1384387200,,207,3.5217391304347827
8510333,1,B007549W44,"I loved this show as a kid and started buying the DVD's.  I found that some episodes would not play on my computer: the video would break up and stop.  For Season 1's discs, I could still play them on my Blue-ray player.  Then I bought this set.  Of the four discs, 1,3, and 4 play fine.  Disc 2 doesn't.  The first episode breaks up at the end.  The other three episodes are completely broken up.  Sadly, I did not discover this until the set was past its return date.  Check all your episodes for playability when you first receive these DVD's.",1519257600,,546,4.2745098039215685
8510334,5,B007549W44,Excellent series,1499817600,,16,7.5
8510335,5,B007549W44,"The FBI: The Second Season, Part One contains the first 16 episodes of the 1966-1967 season. Agents Erskine (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) and Rhodes (Stephen Brooks) are dispatched throughout the United States by Assistant Director Ward (Philip Abbott) to tackle big cases  kidnapping, extortion, murder, counterfeiting, espionage, and terrorism.

Produced with full government cooperation with stories drawn from  the actual files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, The FBI set a new high mark in the depiction of law enforcement on television, giving viewers TV that was equally exciting as it was realistic. The program always portrayed the agency in a favorable light and won the commendation of real-life FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who even allowed filming of some background scenes at the FBI headquarters in Washington. Many telecasts closed with a short segment asking the audience for information on the FBIs most-wanted individuals. The show was a Sunday night staple on ABC for nine seasons.

Guest stars include Ralph Meeker, Robert Blake, Jack Lord, Richard Anderson, Fritz Weaver, Suzanne Pleshette, and Ralph Bellamy.

There are no bonus features on the 4-disc DVD set.",1493078400,,1185,5.418478260869565

8510338,5,B007549W44,"great show, and based on real facts, the actors are good and you believe what you see.  Even if price is a little high I intend to buy more (and in addition I have to pay import duties).  The bad guys are always punished.",1448236800,,221,4.0
8510339,3,B007549W44,"This shows good points are that it isn't filled with  over the top violence.  But honestly,  the stories are very poorly written.  The episode called ""The Raid"", for instance, the FBI agents are going to raid a motel room where the bad guys are hiding out.  Instead of bursting into the room with a team of agents, the sit across the street with a bullhorn and announce their presence expecting the bad guys to come out.  Not very realistic.",1436486400,,441,4.518987341772152
8510340,5,B007549W44,I like the Jack Lord episode. He sure acted real. Excellent series!!!,1432944000,,69,4.833333333333333
8510341,5,B007549W44,The best,1432166400,,8,3.5
8510342,5,B007549W44,Here is the first part of the second series of this classic T.V. program which ran on the A.B.C. network and was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company.  It is obvious that the sponsor knew a good thing when they sponsored it as this show lasted for 9 seasons.  It has a number of big stars in it as well as the regulars of the cast and plenty of action.  Make sure that you buy both parts 1 and 2 together so you won`t miss a minute of the action.,1429574400,,445,3.922222222222222
