2332461,5,B0009X76ZU,"I've seen this like 5 times allready. 5 years in the making tells it all. The whole documentary evolves around Paradise Garage and Larry Levan trough the whole movie. However, there is no info about Club Zanzibar or maybe Studio 54 (but that had a movie of its own). This could be an hour longer for all i care. Surely the focus is on the most influental clubs and its characters. The most amazing thing in this was all the footage from the Garage.

It is a great piece of history on dvd for all new aspiring dj's to see how it all came together. I sat there with mixed feelings after ending. There probably was a little too much focus on Levan yet a whole lot more subjects could be brought into the documentary. Todd Terry should be there, Kerri Chandler too. but again. this is more into the disco era and its figures.

The 2 DVD gives a more wider look on Soundsystems and Ron Hardy to name a few. But this DVD should be in all the enthustiasts collection. Only here you see how yhe Paradise Garage looked like and how it was. Recomended!",1123977600,2,1042,4.284263959390863
2332462,5,B0009X76ZU,"This isn't just the best documentary of it's type; it's the only one.  The movie traces the history of Club Music & Culture from the Loft (New York) in the early 70's to the Warehouse and the Music Box (Chicago)in the mid 80's.  And much of it focuses on the ""missing link"" period of the early 80's when Larry Levan held the torch after disco had ""died"" and before house music was ""invented.""  My only complaint is that I wish there was more...more footage of the Paradise Garage, more classic underground tracks, and more memories.  If you like Electronic Dance Music and/or Music History, you will love this.  At times it is very inspirational (as people tell of their amazing experiences at these legendary clubs and the impact of the originators is weighed) and sad (as the impact of AIDS is discussed).",1123718400,4,807,4.654929577464789

2332522,5,B0009X76ZU,Being a DJ from Chicago I must say this is one of the best docus I have ever seen! Way to go!! I was at a Frankie Knuckles party a few years ago when Frankie showed a clip and told the crowd that they would be filming at the party....So as I am sure to say I was in absolute shock when I brought this dvd and viewed second dvd to find me in the crowed jackin off of my old friend Jamie Principle's performance! I will never forget that night and once more I have been immortalized!!!! giggles! House Nation ONE!!! Learn some history buy this DVD!,1217548800,2,546,4.064814814814815
2332523,3,B0009X76ZU,"I love this film. But frankly the interviews take a lot out of it. You don't really interview Mancuso to the extent that he should have been interviewed. That guy is a freaking genius. Not to mention Two of the greats when it comes to actual dj'ing...Francis Grasso and Steve D'Acquisto...Steve was barely lit at all, and Francis was lit with one spotlight that was right in his face. If I would have been Francis, I would have punched a guy interviewing me like that. How can you call that good cinematography.

Interviewing dj's should always have some great stories to tell about what the movie is supposed to be about. And you had Danny Tenaglia in it for less than a minute, when that guy could tell you stories that would amaze you.

All in all. I really think this should have had a third DVD with it which had all the extended interviews. Including DT, Louie Vega, Jellybean, and all the other great dj's that didn't get enough interview time on this.

And the ORIGINAL video is ONLY 1 hour and 17 minutes. How can you sum up something like this in that short of a timespan. Should have been 2.5 hours at least. People would have definitely sat through that.",1203984000,,1166,4.464788732394366
2332524,4,B0009X76ZU,"I came to the New York City club scene in the mid-90s when people like Michael Alig and the club kids were all the rage.  I never knew the history of what came before them.  I just figured disco transitioned into the gay club scene.  Maestro helped fill in the gaps in my gay history knowledge.

It was fun to learn about a whole period of time that directly inspired things you've experienced.  Maestro puts a face on the people and places that innovated and laid the groundwork for the Tunnel and Twilo and Roxy and Limelight that followed.  That face was Larry Levan.  This was such an interesting documentary.

Of course, the movie had to go into the sad AIDS era that almost every gay documentary goes through but that's what really happened and ignoring it won't help.  I highly recommend watching this movie.  It also works as a great companion piece with Paris is Burning to give a good snapshot of what was going on with the gay underground in New York City in the 1980s.",1202169600,2,980,4.455056179775281

Will definitley make you want to do more research on the club and the time period. Hey, producers, what about 12West, Crisco Disco, the Loft, the Saint, Pyramid, etc. Places that made Studio 54 jealous...",1181520000,3,348,4.507936507936508

If not, there is too much talk about the characters and not enough about the music.  However, the bonus interviews were really good.  The creativity is there in the documentary, but just not enough music.",1153353600,6,301,4.6415094339622645
2332527,3,B0009X76ZU,"Coming from Chicago, being a DJ, and who loves house and dance music, we always heard of Paradise Garage and Larry Levan, and of course, Frankie Knuckles, but this should have been called the Larry Levan story.  I love the old footage from the club, and the information about other places like ""The Loft"".  What is missing is what made all this clubs so special......THE MUSIC!!!!!!  The movie started with ""Disco Circus"", but it had very few songs through out the piece to really take you back.  They should have gotten at least some of the Salsoul collection movie the movie along.  I wanted to love it, but it's ok.",1137888000,8,618,4.581818181818182
2332528,1,B0009X76ZU,"I was eagerly awaiting to get hold of this DVD since I have missed to see the movie in my country. Especially because

I am a 12"" vinyl collector of vintage disco and classic house.

To make it short, the DVD is one big disapointment!!

The documentary is not expressing the soul and heart of this important period of underground dance music history.

The bottom line about this dance culture is MUSIC.

Maestro is just about talking...

Its just not understandable that the whole documentary is underlined with basically just one good song of the mid 80ies period (Master C&J - Face it).

The picture may be of interest for people who used to spend

regular weekends at the loft and paradise-garage. All

others will just find it boring.

Instead, I suggest a brilliant television documentary called ""pump up the volume"" (History of House Music). Its packed with fantastic underground music from disco to house. Its expressing the same message and gives even more background information. But more important it carries the love, excitement and joy for vintage black american underground dance music.",1133136000,12,1099,4.956284153005464
2332529,4,B0009X76ZU,"At first I thought it would be a NY vs Chicago type of thing, which it wasn't.  However, you hear very little about Chicago, except during interviews with Frankie Knuckles, or about Ron Hardy.  That would be the only negative aspect of the film I observed.

This film gives a clear distinction between NY Dance and Chicago House.  I appreciate the fact that at no time did it feel like a competition-of-sorts.  When a time line is presented to you, it's very hard to argue with it.  And, each group's sound is distinct unto itself.  But, it's still all ""FAMILY""

The phrase ""UNDERGROUND"" is used too loosely these days.  When it comes to music genre(s), NY Dance/Chicago House are true Underground music.  You can't deny it when major record labels, as a whole, refuse to include original dance/house tracks on major releases.  But, they are more than happy to let DJs/Re-mixers/Producers put out separate ""authorized"" productions.  You are truly ""underground"" when the bottom line does-not-compute.

In closing, I would ask the younger people/dancers to research the history of ""The Circle"".  This portion of the DVD made me shiver; it hit so close to home.  Complete your journey by researching CAPOEIRA, an Afro-Brasilian martial art originating back more than 300 years ago.  In the film, the dancers couldn't hold in their joy, their desire, their NEED to be a part of The Circle.  Your Circle, called The Roda (pronounced Ho-dah) and the acrobatics involved are linked directly to Capoeira.  Every aspect of the dancers' experiences, described in the film, are ""exactly"" what Capoeira is all about.  This could be an avenue Josell Ramos could investigate.

2332550,5,B0009X76ZU,Ramos does a great job of documenting the beginning of the underground Black gay club scene in New York City.  For me it was nostalgic.  Great footage and interviews.  Kudos to Ramos for putting this project together on film.,1128470400,9,225,4.717948717948718

in the NY scene. Loved the history. It also Reminded me of the time I Danced in the circles at the bar. I would have loved for them to have continue on to the era I was in, but maybe that Could be done on the next dvd a part 2??

8069079,3,B0009X76ZU,"Until the 1970s, the jukebox was the main way of listening to music in New York City clubs, but then DJ-centered dance music as we know it today arose in the legendary venue Paradise Garage. Opening in the disco boom, Paradise Garage quickly became famous for the eclectic music choices of its DJs and later would play a key role in the spread of house music from Chicago to clubs worldwide until it closed in 1987. Josell Ramos's MAESTRO is a 90-minute documentary from 2003 about the Garage, the demographic it drew, and especially the DJ Larry Levan.

The documentary maker goes back to describe The Loft, the invitation-only parties that inspired the Garage, as well as the creation of the 12"" record. There is some archival footage, but mainly this is an interview-driven documentary, and more about the ambience than the music. There are interviews with DJs Antony Ocasio, Nicki Siano, Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, ""Little"" Louie Vega, Derrick May. Especially shocking is an interview with Francis Grasso, who was only in his early 50s at the time, but so worn down by drugs he looks like he's in his 80s (he would die soon after the interview). Also heavily featured are vox pop interviews with people outside a NY club who remember the Garage.

While not dedicating much time to it specifically, MAESTRO aims to depict the prominence of African-Americans and gays (and African-American gays!) in the Garage scene. Viewers whose experience with dance music is the more mainstream form in Europe will probably be surprised by how many men in this documentary talk swish. The impact of AIDS is briefly remembered.

While I enjoyed learning something about the early years of NYC club culture, I was rather disappointed by how padded this documentary was: the main reason that the documentary is 85 minutes long is that the subjects interviewed speak very slowly with a lot of ""uh"" and ""like"". If Ramos had approached this material in a different way, he could have tightened things down to an hour.",1403222400,,2008,4.882697947214076

Thin production values and abysmally unprofessional camera work - the interviews were so badly-filmed and poorly-lit, it should be criminal.  For example, the movie would show people being interviewed in a completely dark room with only a flashlight pointed at their face.  Or an entire crowd of people on the street, each person shouting to be heard.  Or two interview subjects, both talking away in the same room, at the exact time, for sentences on end....and we're supposed to make sense of this?  I've never in my life seen a movie with such terrible lighting, direction, and camera work on such a FASCINATING subject matter!  I was so looking forward to enjoying ""Maestro"" but the amateur hastily-filmed interview footage was an embarassment - I mean, they teach better camera work than this in high school for crying out loud.
