If there are any actual Ron atkins fans out there who appreciate a good exploitation film then this is worth a look. I hoped it would be as classic as Shizophreniac - The [...] Mangler but not quite as good I had to give it 5 stars because it's Ron Atkins and apparently this fell into the hands of a few idiots that didn't know what they're buying.  If you are lucky enough to find this check it out! It is entertaining.",1193702400,2,509,4.247422680412371
7991845,1,B00009N1VP,"No Lemmy. We watched it for 30 minutes, and that was 35 minutes too long.

Don't waste your time! Don't make our mistake!

Too much violence against women. Ron Atkins HATES women.",1119225600,2,179,4.5625
7991846,1,B00009N1VP,This is not the one with the Motorhead soundtrack. Do not buy this unless you want to lend Amazon.com the cost of the item for a few weeks while they process the return. It is NOT the Eat the Rich you are looking for.,1114387200,3,217,3.9545454545454546
7991847,1,B00009N1VP,"Not the British Comedy!!!!!

It won't be watched.",1114214400,4,67,5.0
7991848,1,B00009N1VP,"Oh well I thought I was getting Lemmy from Motorhead

THIS IS NOT THAT MOVIE

It is not in London but in Nevada !!

Anybody know where the 'real' Eat the Rich can be found?",1114128000,3,172,3.857142857142857
7991849,1,B00009N1VP,"Just a word of warning to prospective buyers -- this is NOT the 1987 film ""Eat The Rich"" starring Lemmy Kilmeister and Lana Pellay.  I purchased it thinking it was (I'm even sure I saw the name Peter Richardson attached to the blurb, though I can't find it now).

I haven't watched this movie yet, so can't actually give an opinion in that regard.",1105228800,7,347,4.40625
