8653028,5,B00JPQ1IME,"While I read the other reviews, I understand the comments of ""dull"" and basically boring. The DVD is a run-through of the Presidents, VP's, and duties of the Presidents. I am a very, very proud history buff and, for one, loved the set as a little extra knowledge on the men that have led our country. Informational and entertaining  (to me, at least) and I would actually recommend it to be used as parts for a classroom lecture on US History or even American Government. Enjoy!",1481673600,,478,4.558139534883721
8653029,1,B00JPQ1IME,"Very, very dull.  It plays like a video presented in a middle school history class.  Total waste of money.  Donated to library.",1455235200,2,127,4.681818181818182
8653030,3,B00JPQ1IME,"I bought this to use in my government class and I had two major issues.
1. It is really boring. I mean, I found it interesting, but I also teach government. Is this going to engage someone who is not into history or government? I don't think so.
2. The description was not what the episode was.",1428278400,3,294,4.175438596491228
