2383633,4,B000AAEIXA,"Both satirical and tragic, Torremolinos 73 has considerable entertainment value while also raising important questions about what it means to be a man in our modern era. Without giving any of the plot away, Alfredo has to make a rather odd choice at the end of the film; the type of choice which would not easily be made many years ago. In my estimation, the ending will definitely affect most of the men who see it which is an independent indicator of its being well done. Torremolinos 73 also captures an era as it makes us remember the drabness of the 1970s which is a consistent source of mirth and interest throughout.",1170201600,,623,4.571428571428571
2383634,4,B000AAEIXA,"Set in early 1970s Spain, this buoyantly wry film begins with doors closing in paradise, proceeds to matters of the flesh, and culminates in a deal with the devil. Then, heretically, tops the whole thing off with proof of a living, breathing, man-made golden miracle.

The paradise is the MY PARADISE Apartments where, as the film opens, door after door is being shut in the face of a bowed but stoically undaunted encyclopedia salesman named Alfredo Lopez (Camara). He owes three months rent, his wife Carmen (Pena) is nagging him about having a baby and he's about to be fired after 15 years on the job. What to do? His boss, the diabolical Don Carlos of Montoya Publishers, seems to know. He suggests that Alfredo and Carmen make educational films about ""Spanish reproductive customs"" for a Swedish-Spanish business collaboration of his called THE WORLD AUDIOVISUAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF REPRODUCTION. A former assistant of Ingmar Bergman is on had to show Alfredo how to make them.

The plot thickens when Alfredo proves such a quick study that he's awarded Bergman's bull horn. With that and Don Carlos' commission in hand, Alfredo and Carmen set to work and in almost no time at all a new, and extremely lucrative, door opens up for the Lopez family.

There is nothing to dislike about this movie as scene after delightful scene is filled with interesting characters, compelling images, wry humor, pleasant surprise, bitter truth and the beautiful naked body of Carmen. Small wonder then at what happens when Alfredo is ushered into the room of a fertility clinic and asked to make a donation. Though the walls are covered with photographs of attractive, but clothed, women he still finds himself, well, uninspired. Until, resourcefully, he reaches into his wallet, takes out a picture of Carmen, pastes that on the wall, and gets down to business. Little does he suspect that hordes of Norsemen might be equally resourceful.

There's a hint of beastly pleasure in a delicious bit that finds a middle-aged woman alone in bed completing a jigsaw puzzle of (what else?) a rhinoceros. Suddenly moans and the creaking of bedsprings are heard. Quickly, she realizes that Carmen and Alfredo are at it again. Displeased initially. she slowly succumbs to the rhythm of the beat and leans closer to the wall to better appreciate their filmmaking. In a beauty salon another middle-aged woman is beside herself because she's just been to Brando's latest film, circa 1972, and didn't appreciate what was on the screen. So much so that in between waxings she complains, ""I thought LAST TANGO IN PARIS was a musical!""

The cast is wonderful. The dialogue is witty. The director's touch is as light as Lubitsch's. Only here the cameras, Pablo's and Alfredo's, do go into the bedroom.",1142899200,2,2768,4.944086021505377
2383635,5,B000AAEIXA,"Absolutly loved this movie! If you like foreign films I higly recommend you see this. It's a very funny and original film that I got to see in the Miami Film Fest of 2004 and was by far the best movie I saw in the festival. The director Pablo Berger was also there and conducted a great Q&A session at the end of the film. Again, highly recommended!",1128902400,2,349,4.147058823529412

8076986,4,B000AAEIXA,"This is a film in Spanish with English subtitles, which Mads Mikkelsen filmed very early in his career.  It was one of his beginning roles in films, and he appears about 40 minutes into the film.  He does, however, have a key role.  This is a very funny film, but not to be watched by children.  It was made in Spain, I believe, and had very little success there.  The film was a huge success in Scandinavia.",1417564800,,408,4.246753246753247

8076989,1,B000AAEIXA,"of course, no one so brunette and ethnically original would put on a show for posterity because the blondes are clinically curious.

This is an indictment of Northern pornographic invasion of privacy, the degeneracy of wanting to steal the inappropriate, the value of unwillingness of private emotional property made public and about snuff films by the Axis, home invasions where they made the Allied occupants play their ""funny games"" as Selma Blair martyred herself to depict in ""In Their Skin""

The fact that the Koreans cranked out and completed writing (still filming but already airing) the out of character so outspoken as to be crude and callous ""It's Okay That's Love"" to the objections of the domestic audience indicates the Axis is going to unofficially release the snuff films of feld hures and comfort women not able to express objection in internet forums that cannot be shut down i.e. the Japanese forums and streaming video services IF China does not back down from standing up to Japan.

This is a hideous film, unwatchable about a hideous and unwatchable premise - but it may indicate as of its making in 2003 that the Allies knew about the films but also the whereabouts - maybe Rudolf Hess told them, maybe over a particularly comfortable and drowsy late evening after dinner over cigars and cognac with a particularly harmless and ingratiating diplomat (maybe a Canadian tennis playing ambassador), a disgruntled/deposed Japanese prince shared a confidence.

2015 is the ETA of Korea's Comfort Women white paper - will that arrive before an unfortunate leak in the Japanese forums of ""party"" footage of deadfaced victims forced to sing and dance and worse.

The pain, the suffering would have been unbearable and unimaginable - especially those traded across the seas for Orc/Goblin exchange.  Have you tried this?  She's the daughter of a rabbi.  Oh?  How about the daughter of a Corean Confucian scholar?  Her family will never see her again.",1407024000,,1965,5.037037037037037
8076990,4,B000AAEIXA,"If you like foreign movies you will like this. It is set in the 70's so there is a candor view of sex. If you expect to see a lot of sex this is not your movie. It is kind of fresh for a change comparing with hot comedies nowadays, but the story it is funny and has a good end. The actors are naive and great.",1404172800,,309,3.626865671641791
8076991,5,B000AAEIXA,"With Women on the verge..., this is the most hilarious Spanish movie ever. I was only midly attracted by the storyline but watched it anyway because I liked Javier Cmara, an accident that I never regretted. You empathise immediately with this poor encyclopedia door-to-door saleman as he gets rejected and his wife in '73 Spain and later as they feel trapped to accept an offer to shoot a ""Scientific Sex Encyclopedia"" for the Danes... They rest is for you to discover. Nathalie",1385251200,,478,4.841463414634147
8076992,4,B000AAEIXA,"I wonder how they managed to film this in Franco's Spain.

I thoroughly enjoyed the film but have to issue a warning that there are some sex scenes which are fairly graphic.",1362614400,,173,4.40625
8076993,5,B000AAEIXA,"Sweet take on the perils of enthusiasm.  Funny performances all round,  Wry humour and an underlying kindliness. And the clash of cultures is nicely understated.",1361577600,2,161,5.4
8076994,5,B000AAEIXA,"Another bleak urban scene to open matters; bleaker still because he is selling encyclopaedias of the History of Spain (with the inducement of a free statuette), door-to-door, in an apartment block of many. There is no working lift so he climbs many floors, lugging his wares. He returns to his own apartment, soaked by the rain, is confronted by his landlady; his rent is three months in arrears. It's misery. He enters his apartment and another dimension to his existence presents itself.

Sales are plummeting for encyclopedias. In Scandinavia, sales are rocketing for An Audio-visual Encyclopedia of Human Reproduction. The company owner wants to make a Spanish version. Employees are asked to volunteer with their wives to demonstrate the reproductive process. Our salesman volunteers and does so for his wife as well.

The source of the movie's title is revealed in a very funny sequence, where he is having to produce an ejaculation for a sperm count. It is touching on various levels.

The film proceeds, as a film within a film. The climax is intensely emotional, on two counts.

This is a touching and loving film, with humour and pathos.",1318377600,,1147,4.989528795811518
