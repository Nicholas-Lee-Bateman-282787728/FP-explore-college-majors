3144874,5,B0015HZA6Q,"This is a wonderful film. A refreshing, bright and approachable tale about how a young woman's life after college. It shows life from Sarabeth's point of view; she's not always right, she's sometimes annoying and she makes mistakes. But she is real.
This is a great story that hasn't been seen before but still feels familiar. A gem! :)",1208908800,,336,4.711864406779661
3144875,5,B0015HZA6Q,"Marla Sokoloff does a great job with this coming of age film.  I love Idina Menzel as the big sister and, of course Tovah Feldshuh is the quintessential mom.  I have watched this movie a bunch of times, and it is one I will keep on hand for a pick-me-up.  You cant lose with this one!",1207612800,,284,4.035714285714286

8258471,3,B0015HZA6Q,"To be honest, the only reason i bought this was because Idina Menzel was in it but the movie was okay. I found some little parts funny. The ending sucked.",1401580800,,154,4.166666666666667
8258472,1,B0015HZA6Q,"I disliked this movie so much that after about 15 minutes I removed it from DVD player, broke it into little pieces and threw it in the trash. Not good enough to even give to Goodwill.  Negative, dark, and not at all what I expected from Marla Sokoloff.",1321574400,,253,4.270833333333333
8258473,5,B0015HZA6Q,"What a gem of a flick!!  Great characters (and actors!), dialogue, and NYC scenery.  The story has spirit and appeal to young artists striking out on their own as well as serve as family film.  The writer has plenty of heart - I'm glad a special story like this one, bubbling with original characters and insightful humor, made it to film.  Looking forward to the next work from this writer.",1295222400,,391,4.542857142857143
8258474,2,B0015HZA6Q,"I wanted to like this movie and I did like many of the actresses.  The plot left a lot to be desired, however.  What I liked most was seeing the paintings that Sarabeth created.  What I liked least was an ending that left a lot dangling. (spoiler alert) I'm not sure what the director was trying to accomplish with this movie--if she wanted to show Sarabeth's growing independence, the point of that was rather blunted by a too-perfect love interest, with no great answers as to why she was giving him up or why she couldn't have both man & career.  In fact, the story of Sarabeth's lesbian sister overshadows Sarabeth's own story & you are left wondering whether the sister's love story works out, whatever happened to the female priest she was interested in, etc.  And not sure why the father's sickness was brought up--does he get to see his grandkids or does he die first?  Why bring it up if you're not going to finish the story?  And what happens to the other sister?  Do they find the errant brother & bring him to justice?  Live in the parents' house forever?  Does she have her baby ok?  Don't even get me started on the ending, where Sarabeth gets to the tollbooth & just turns around...  OK, symbolic or whatever, everything is so centered on what is going on in her head, that it makes an incredibly dull and anticlimatic ending.  My husband turned to me & said, ""is that it?""  Um, yeah.  Not sure what the other reviewers saw in this film, but I just found it disappointing.",1255392000,,1487,4.455555555555556
8258475,5,B0015HZA6Q,"I saw this movie at the Sarasota Film Festival the year it opened.  It was my favorite of the fest (in spite of my own film showing there).  I am so happy it's now on DVD.  The acting was amazing ... I loved the story and the director did a spectacular job.  We had a movie screening of it at my home once I bought it...everyone thoroughly enjoyed the story and loved the way the Jewish faith weaved throughout the film...truly contemporary tale of love.  I highly...correction...WE highly recommend this film!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tollbooth/dp/B0015HZA6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tollbooth</a>",1228262400,,652,5.821052631578947
8258476,4,B0015HZA6Q,"This is another cute movie that stars the adorable Marla Sokoloff - it makes no sense to me why this actress isn't more famous.
The movie isn't brilliant, but it's sweet, realistic and funny. It has some great characters in it, good acting and let's Marla shine a little.
I'd recommend this if you're a fan or if you want to see a movie about a Jewish family and their interconnected relationships.",1226275200,,398,4.541666666666667
8258477,5,B0015HZA6Q,I loved this movie!  I could really connect to what was happening to the main character and the best was Idina Menzel (sister) and Tovah Feldshuh (Mom).  Tovah plays that Mom that everyone can relate to.  It's really a wonderful film!  Very Funny! Loved it!,1219881600,,257,4.644444444444445
8258478,5,B0015HZA6Q,"The Tollbooth is one of those great movies that you can watch over and over again.  It is touching to see this young woman come in to her own.  Marla Sokoloff, Idina Menzel and Tovah Feldshuh are great!  This is a must see!",1217980800,,223,4.1395348837209305
8258479,5,B0015HZA6Q,"My husband and I watched this movie together. We both found it funny, touching, honest, and inspiring. We have recommended it to lots of our friends!",1210723200,,149,4.769230769230769
