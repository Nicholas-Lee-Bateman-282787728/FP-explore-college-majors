2100796,4,B0002KQNQ8,"What Alice Found is Spartan, it breaks the craft of filmmaking down into its most basic elements and executes well on every one.  There are no flaming helicopters to be found here, or big name stars, nowhere to hide.  Instead of distractions you find a well-conceived script, excellent acting, and subtle moral choices that never invite cheap, easy answers.

The entire cast of the picture could, and does, fit into an RV - it's a three-person ensemble piece.  Digital photography gives What Alice Found a scruffy, high school project feeling that is perfectly in step with the protagonist's innocence and the cheesy ambience of truck stop hooking.  In short, writer/director Dean Bell has turned drawbacks into allies.

The simple plot supports a complex character study.  Alice, played admirably by newcomer Emily Grace, is running away from home to visit a friend in Florida.  Brief flashbacks are used effectively to inform this decision, and help us understand her background.  On the road she is befriended, unless ""Shanghaied"" is a better word, by a couple that roams truck stops in their mobile brothel RV.  Part pimps and part surrogate parents, they quickly fold Alice into their world.  Though she stays naive, we track her downward spiral by the way she looks.

The showcase performance here is by Judith Ivey, her Sandra manages to convey a broad range of emotions, and motives, without ever once seeming forced.  She knows a lot, and she's quick to instruct Alice in the ways of the world, all she's discovered since she escaped Paducah, Kentucky.  Through the course of the film we come to understand that neither Alice nor Sandra are completely innocent or guilty, and despite the unkind conditions, an important bond of understanding has been formed.

That is the greatest strength of What Alice Found.  Had it been about an innocent waif victimized by horrid road vagabonds, it would have been two-dimensional.  As it is, there's real depth.  Highly recommended.",1160265600,9,1980,5.04
2100797,5,B0002KQNQ8,"A beautiful, poignant movie that surprised me. Small, yes, but strangely moving and satisfying after starting out slow. Surprisingly good performances all around from people who don't look like they're professional actors, most of them.",1145491200,4,236,5.771428571428571
2100798,3,B0002KQNQ8,"I got this movie because Amazon recommended it based on some other movie that I watched.  I am not sure what movie that was or how it tied to this one, but I guess that is besides the point.  This movie is about a girl that is trying to get away from the town she grew up in like her girlfriend that left to go to college, but she doesn't have it so easy.  She ended up stealing from her boss in order to have some money.  Once she gets on the road in her beat up Escort, her car has problems and she runs into Sandra and Bill.  Because of my usual pessimistic attitude, I was immediately suspicious of this couple.  They were just tooo nice.  That never bodes well with me.

Anyways, it is a pretty good film.  It was very real in the sense that alot of girls may run away or somehow get on the streets and are so naive thinking that someone is going to help them just because.  It is a pessimistic attitude, but more than likely if someone comes out of nowhere to help you, normally there is a large price to pay. You have to think about if what you are running away from is really worth the price you will pay for help from strangers.  Alice found out.

This movie is not for children, so don't watch it with your little ones.  The Sandra character was a mixed bag, she was just so doggone sweet and understanding that you just don't really know how to feel about her.  Even though I did like the film, I am not sure if/when I would watch it again.  I did find the movie interesting and I thought the acting was great.  I also thought they did a good job of setting the characters up so that you could actually feel during the movie.  Good job!",1141430400,5,1647,4.080996884735202
2100799,4,B0002KQNQ8,"""What Alice Found"" is one of those flicks that just grabs at you when you're skimming channels for a movie to watch.  It stars newcomer Emily Grace as Alice, a young girl fed up with her dull life in New England who decides to run off to Miami, FL to find herself and possibly get a degree in Marine Biology.  Along the way, she has car trouble and is ""helped"" by Bill and Sandra, an older couple who seem to be as sweet as all get out.  The duo, especially Sandra, becomes attached to Alice and they basically help her out in any way possible.  As the miles pile up on her roadtrip, however, Bill and Sandra take her down the dark road of truck stop prostitution.

Emily Grace does a great job as the gullible young Alice.  Judith Ivey, who's probably the only actor in this film that you'll recognize, is wonderful as Sandra.  By the end of the film, you don't know whether to hug her or hit her.  She's so sugary sweet that she's almost too hard to swallow.  However, she gives a great performance.  Bill Raymond plays Bill, who comes across as such a nice guy in the beginning of the film but eventually turns into a dirty and dispicable old man.

The story moves along at a solid pace and has a pretty good soundtrack to boot.  It's recommended to fans of indie flicks but the average movie-goer should give it a peek.",1140566400,2,1323,4.290322580645161
2100800,4,B0002KQNQ8,"Judith Ivey's performance is outstanding in this well-written and nicely directed independent movie. Although this is a small-budget film, with all the drawbacks that implies, it's still very much worth seeing. The characters are engaging and complex, and you come to care deeply what will happen to them, especially Alice.

I'll look forward to seeing more from director Dean Bell, and will certainly watch for Judith Ivey in future roles. She should have won an Oscar for this performance.",1103500800,4,491,5.215189873417722
2100801,5,B0002KQNQ8,"Intriguing characters and an engaging plot were just two things that made me love this movie. There was a lot of potential for this film to be really bad, but the complexity of the characters and the situation in which they were involved kept it from descending to the depths of similar types of movies. The main character's choices were wholly plausible and kept the story genuine. Quite symbolically, the RV in which they all rode seemed big and accommodating at first, but became more and more claustrophobic as the film developed and the main character felt more trapped with each passing day. Great movie, excellent writing.",1484179200,2,629,4.88785046728972

2100803,5,B0002KQNQ8,"A solidly written and directed indy/coming of age/thriller/road movie that lives up to all the reviews on here.  Unusual and surprising at every turn with a ton of heart. A film that actually makes you think about the characters and their motives and it's not so easy to decide who is right or wrong.  They each are put into their individual predicaments by a social order that locks them in. It's also a great look at a mother-daughter relationship and what parental love truly means. All while being incredibly suspenseful. Shot in the early days of digital video, the gritty look of it works, but it's a shame it couldn't have been done with today's high def equipment.  Great sound track featuring Emmylou Harris and Beth Orton.  Worth a look.",1478995200,,747,4.723076923076923
2100804,5,B0002KQNQ8,"Got this movie because of Judith Ivey - was a bit shocked, but message is to be thankful for what you have.

2100806,2,B0002KQNQ8,"A terrible movie, makes no sense, not worth the price, all reviews that I read have been low rated, I got it because it was cheap. Cheap does not always mean good.",1397433600,,163,4.125
2100807,5,B0002KQNQ8,"While made for what literally looks like $50, and shot on what seems to
be a home video camera, film-maker Bell manages to make these
limitations work for him, giving this disturbing, ambiguous story a
sense of odd reality. His actors are so good, (especially the great NY
theater actress Judith Ivey) that rather than feeling amateurish, the
style makes the film feel uncomfortably voyeuristic and appropriate.

Alice is running away from an awful home life when she meets a
well-meaning couple on the road who help her out, and take her on with
them.  Then they turn out to be less altruistic and somewhat creepier
than they appear.

While this might sound like a recipe for a low budget horror film, Bell
keeps the film and the characters in shades of tense but low key grey.
Everyone, even our heroine, has their secrets, and true motives are
always a question mark. No heroes, no villains just people surviving
and using each other in the process.

If this is a 'thriller' at all, it's a thriller of behavior, not action
and violence, ala more recent films like 'We Need to Talk About Kevin'
and 'Shame'. It's really more a dark coming-of-age film.

Not all the acting is up to Ivey's level, and some of the flashbacks
are a bit on-the-nose, but overall I found the film far more quietly
haunting and thought provoking than the vast majority of what I see.

One frustration on the DVD front.  The newer Wellspring is in 1:66,
the older Fox Lorber is listed as 1:85 (although I haven;t seen it).
While imdb lists 1:85 as correct, it's hard to imagine a generally
film friendly company like Wellspring changing to a wrong aspect
ratio for no reason.  And trying to research it I could find no
definitive answer as to the film-maker's original intent.  That
said, the Wellspring has a very nicely done commentary track,
which is not listed as a feature on the Fox-Lorber.",1330905600,2,1873,4.651515151515151
2100808,5,B0002KQNQ8,"If you like movies with troubled women, you'll love this one. Anyone who has spent time on the road will appreciate the darkness lurking around truck stops and the variety of people one sees while traveling the American highways. Judith Ivey's performance is excellent; her character is beautiful, tragic, optimistic, tough, and real. I love the music in this film as well--the musical score is haunting and perfect in every scene. Overall a great film!!",1316563200,3,454,5.066666666666666
2100809,5,B0002KQNQ8,"My wife really likes this film. It not what you intend to do but when conditions change
and your left holding the bag, you do things that you normaly wouldn't have done. AMAZON done me right again, thanks",1294790400,,204,4.394736842105263
2100810,3,B0002KQNQ8,"Very mundane film style. Following a real story with real characters, that, of course, have their quirks-- or else the film wouldn't be worth viewing. And in the same vein, the story deals with prostitution, which is a rather irregular type of work-- yet, still is well-traveled story terrain.

I saw this film last night on the channel 7 late night Saturday film broadcast. The prostitution aspect got my attention, the beautiful woman playing the prostitute worked on me too. Thinking I'd click it off at some point, it ended up maintaining my interest. The older woman is an exceptional actress, sort of like the younger version of the old, wacky neighbor (Ruth Morton) in Rosemary's Baby . The sex scenes were alluring and emotional. Her drive to find something more and move out of a small town is not a phenomenal story goal, but real enough to empathize with this character. Wanting more, yeah, I can relate to that.

The film shamelessly overuses flashbacks and extreme close ups, film devices that are often cited as ""what not to do"" in every film production and screenplay writing book I've ever read. It also settles on bad acting and choppy editing in some circumstances. It doesn't have the greatest production quality either, looking rather cheap, possibly shot on a mid-priced mini-dv recorder. Doesn't matter either, it's actually a refreshing departure from the usual visual gloss of high-priced films. This film just plods along to complete its tale no matter what, and it ignores all of these faults and succeeds. I'm pleased to see the director not heed to these constraints  because the story is delivered movingly regardless. It teaches a good lesson in just telling your story no matter what criticism may try to mar it. The protagonist is identifiable and we cheer for her, and the film achieves its goal in displaying a very mundane tale that details ordinary characters that are pushed to somewhat extraordinary circumstances. Lastly, the somewhat extraordinary proves to be much more interesting to watch than the extraordinary because the extraordinary in television shcws like ""24"", and action films like ""Die Hard"", and heavy dramas like ""A Beautiful Mind"" have all become more ordinary than a film like this.",1270339200,2,2239,4.997319034852547

The lack of nudity and profanity make it an acceptable movie for adolescent and teen girls to highlight the very real and unseen dangers out there. If a teen is offered extensive help from a nice middle-aged married couple the very last thing she would expect is to eventually be turned out.",1504051200,,467,4.441860465116279
