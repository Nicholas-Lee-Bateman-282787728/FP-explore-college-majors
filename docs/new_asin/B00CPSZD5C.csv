8584677,5,B00CPSZD5C,"This is a balm to an aching heart, so shot thru with goodness, wonder, love, compassion and possibilities that it is restorative.  As good (if not better) than Hayao Miyasaki's work, which I also love (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B074121MFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whisper-of-the-Heart/dp/B000CDGVOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whisper of the Heart</a>), or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Song-of-the-Sea/dp/B00TFVZXHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Song of the Sea</a>.  Shimmering, stunningly beautiful animation, lovely music, and inspired characterizations.  Even the subtitles are gorgeous, top notch, both visually (bright white on a black background) and lyrically/narratively.  But don't watch with the sound off- you must hear the character's voices and inflections.

Natsume's Book of Friends began as a manga (comic book) series, serialized from 2005- present (the first 20 of the 22 volumes to date are available on Amazon in both paperback and kindle formats).  It was adapted into an animated (anime) TV series, broadcast in Japan for six seasons, in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2017.  The first four seasons are available on Amazon Prime Video.  Both the manga and anime versions are critically acclaimed, and embody the best of Japanese sensibilities.  I often watch the NHK Network on PBS because these sensibilities are not only intriguing but therapeutic- attention to detail and a love of craftsmanship and excellence for its own sake, an animistic orientation towards all living things and the world as a living whole, and care and compassion for others' feelings and welfare (especially evident in their attitudes toward elders and the care thereof, ditto with pets).  Such values are embodied in Natsume's Book of Friends, the notion that even the smallest and seemingly least significant of beings (e.g., frogs, cats, children) are of of equal importance in the scheme of things.

At the heart of this tale is a strange orphan boy's love for his deceased grandmother, who didn't quite fit into the world either.  The story jumps back and forth between two timelines, the boy's and his grandmother's at roughly the same age, in many ways pursuing twin paths.  Involved are supernatural spirits and forces, destiny, self-determination, discovering one's identity and purpose (along with going to high school and the pressures relating thereto).  Haunting and mysterious, there's also whimsy, humor, pathos, suspense, and INSPIRED storytelling.  Nothing is quite what it seems to be; the show channels the fears, hopes and dreams of a child's heart.  After one episode you may well be hooked like I was, I promptly bought all four seasons to savor.  Simply wonderful.",1510444800,,2906,6.1182266009852215
8584678,5,B00CPSZD5C,"I love this show. Very slow paced in the mood of slice of life. A lot of the episodes can easily leave one on the verge of tears due to the sad tales within, but overall very uplifting. I recommend this to anime fans who love the more slower paced, slice of life shows.",1446163200,,269,4.0

8584680,5,B00CPSZD5C,"Takashi Natsume sees things that most people can not. Strange creatures called 'yokai' live along side us, interacting with the world, but unseen to most humans. Some are sweet and gentle, others are malevolent and dangerous. Together with his 'bodyguard' Nyanko-sensei, Natsume both battles and befriends the various yokai that come after him for the Book of Friends, a book that binds the names of many different yokai.

Natsume Yuujin-chou continues to delight. If you've enjoyed it so far then you will continue to enjoy it. The ending wraps up with a nice visit to Natsume's past in the form of his parents old house and memories of his father. It is not a definitive ending (and the manga is still ending), but does provide a little bit of closure. Of course, I still hold hope for a fifth season.

The fourth season is 13 episodes long. Everything comes stored in a long hardcover case that contains the complete series on 2 DVDs and the complete series on 2 Blu-ray discs. Also included is a full color, 28 page hardcover art book. It includes  in-depth character bios, an episode guide, key character and background art, and more. The cover is modeled after the Book of Friends :)
This series does not have a dub, so the only audio option is Japanese.

BONUS If you buy this set through NIS America, not only is it cheaper (and has free shipping), but it also comes with a Nyanko-sensei bookmark (while supplies last)! Not as cool as the book bag that came with the first set (bonus no longer available), or the two keychains that came with the second set (bonus still available), but still a nice bonus.",1390953600,8,1613,4.649122807017544
