1432370,5,B00005JKE1,"I don't know if it is because I have a soft spot for quixotic, heroic adventures but I thought that this movie was really fun.  Sure it had its flaws but all movies do.  Now if you want to see a movie for its historical or realistic value this is not the one to see.  But if you like to be entertained this one was wonderful.  I liked it so much that I went to see it a second time.  This movie also has a little humor which I thought was great.  Also if you don't like any other part of the movie, the choreography was absolutely spectacular.  There is a little adult content so I would recommend this movie not to every one but to all my older friends.",1007856000,2,654,3.9846153846153847
1432371,3,B00005JKE1,"I found this movie extremely enjoyable.  I didn't go to see the movie because of the THREE MUSKETEERS, after all it's original title was D'Artagnan.  So, to be honest I went to see Mena Suvari and was quite pleased by the overall result of the film.  I will admit that there was some poor editing.  For example, when all the Musketeers arrive to help D'Artagnan he greets his horse wearing his blue musketeer cloak.  In the very next scene he is not wearing it, and it is handed to him.  I noticed this in the movie theater and was excited because to be honest, I'm not usually that quick.

BUT!  If you enjoy movies that take you to another place and another time, then by all means this is a decent movie worth checking out.  Or if your Mena Suvari fan, of course she's cute in this too!  Enjoy!",1006128000,,797,4.2885906040268456
1432372,3,B00005JKE1,"okay if you are like man and were forced to read the book at an early age and have seene just about every other musketeer movie out there, than this movie will most likely be a letdown.  the focus of the movie, unlike the novel and other movies is solely on Dartagnan.  the classic hummor of porthos and Athos has been almost forgotten.  the comedic element brought ot the story by alexandre Dumas is not quite there.
However if you are into martial arts, which i also am, then this movie won't be that bad.  still poor acting tends to gradually push this movie down the rating scale.  some fighting sequences are simply outrageoud, to cause even me to say ""okay this is a bit to much.""  but then again i don't go watch movies to be a critic,  i go to the movies to just sit back in the dark room and relax, so i was not completly disapointed.",1005868800,,843,4.23125

1432407,1,B00005JKE1,"The other reviewers got this one right.  This film was a mess from start to finish.  The plot and acting are subpar, I can't imagine any of the musketeers of France getting into the situations presented in the film.  This is one of those films that was green lighted from the big success of another film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, which was a very good movie.  Everything in The Musketeer seems forced or far fetched.  The film is not worth your time or money.  There are countless 3 Musketeer films out there and this one is by far the worst I have ever seen.  You would be better off reading the book by Alexandre Dumas. Everyone loves a good swashbuckling adventure film but this is definitely not one.",1431561600,,709,4.4921875
1432408,4,B00005JKE1,"Loosely based on Alexandre Dumas' classic adventure novel ""The Three Musketeers,"" 2001's ""The Musketeer"" stars Justin Chambers as d'Artagnan who, as a kid, witnesses his parents murdered by the wicked Febre (Tim Roth). As a young man seeking justice, he travels to Paris and hooks up with the three Musketeers (Nick Moran, Steve Speirs and Jan-Gregor Kremp). Meanwhile he takes a fancy to fiery chambermaid, Francesca (Mena Suvari), who is the daughter of the deceased seamstress to the Queen (Catherine Deneuve). Stephen Rea plays the corrupt and despicable Cardinal Richelieu.

While people love to loathe this film I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was directed by Peter Hyams (director of 1999's ""End of Days"") and comes across as a less-grim Conan tale switched to 17th century France and plays like 1995's ""Rob Roy"" with a kinetic Indiana Jones flair, albeit set in France rather than Scotland. The tone is essentially realistic until the swashbuckling scenes take place, which are dynamic, but totally over-the-top.

If you're a fan of the Conan, Rob Roy, Indiana Jones, Sinbad and Zorro flicks I think you'll appreciate this movie. It's as good or better than most of them. No kidding. Beyond the thrilling action sequences, there are a number of great or near-great elements: Chambers plays a great protagonist and Roth the perfect villain, the latter proved in ""Rob Roy"" (he's just as wicked here). Not to mention, the lovely Mena is formidable as the babe. But it's the excellent sets and mood that I like most  the cobblestone streets, torches, horses & carriages, villages, castles and 17th century costuming. It's inexplicable that Chambers didn't go on to become a star, like Brad Pitt.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

1432464,1,B00005JKE1,"My expectations for this movie were vague. I'd never heard of star Justin Chambers (I now know why), but I was familiar with director Peter Hyams and liked his ""Capricorn One"" and ""Outland"", so I figured what the heck.

What the heck, indeed.

This movie was awful. Justin Chambers cannot act. (I've never understood the allure of the cherubic Mena Suvari either.) Not that acting chops could've saved the script. I was willing to give the ""twist"" - Hong Kong-style hijinks in 17th c. France - a chance, but even that didn't work. The fact that the fight sequences were so contrived wasn't the worst of it. It's the fact that they were photographed so badly and the faces of the ""actors"" were nearly always in shadow. I realized the only reason I continued watching was to see Catherine Deneuve, who didn't have a lot to work with either, but still managed to be her usual luminous self.

What I don't get is how the director of two of my personal favorites managed to churn out this dust-bunny of a movie. Was he happy with the way it turned out? Did he notice that his lead couldn't act? Did he care? (""Sean Connery? Bah! Get me that Chambers kid!"")

It also put me to sleep. Zonked me right out. And I wasn't tired. I just couldn't keep my eyes open. ""The Musketeer"" should've been called ""The Ambien"".

Save your time and money (as the studio that released this should've done) and avoid this lackluster swashbuckler.",1327017600,,1421,4.556862745098039

1432466,3,B00005JKE1,"Fourteen years after his parents were murdered D'Artagnan arrives in Paris to pursue his dream of becoming a King's Royal Musketeer. That sentence alone should cue readers of Alexander Dumas's THE THREE MUSKETEERS that this film is very much a loose adaptation. There are perhaps three truly extreme departures. The presence of the menacing Febre (Tim Roth). The absence of Milady de Winter. And D'Artagnan's fighting style which is a more dynamic sort of fencing as done by Hong Kong cinema. Purists will certainly be up in arms. I ain't mad at them.

And yet some things remain the same. Young D'Artagnan is still dashing and daring and a fierce stickler for honor. The Musketeers are still fiercely loyal to the King, in fact, so loyal that they've fallen out of favor, what with the crafty Cardinal Richelieu pulling political strings, widening his sphere of influence while sapping the King's power base. In Paris D'Artagnan meets up with what's left of the Musketeers, and these are a pretty slovenly lot of swordsmen. Whoever wrote the screenplay plays fast and loose with the source material. Maybe he only read the cliff notes. D'Artagnan still romances the Queen's lovely chamber maid (a listless Mena Suvari). There's still that intrigue with Lord Buckingham and a secret mission for the Queen. This time, though, the Queen (Catherine Deneuve) herself goes along for the ride, masquerading as a peasant woman.

You scan the credits and you may notice Catherine Deneuve, Stephen Rea, and Tim Roth's names scrolling up. That's an exalted supporting cast, except that, really, only Tim Roth makes an impression as the skeevy eye-patched Febre. Roth really does excel at oozing sheer malice (just check out ROB ROY). However, Stephen Rea, who's best at roles in which he can internalize, isn't quite a showy enough presence to pass as Richelieu. And I guess they got it right with titling the film THE MUSKETEER, because the story hones in on D'Artagnan, almost to the exclusion of his fellow Musketeers. Aramis, Athos and Porthos, even more than ever, are reduced to glorified sidekick status. I did enjoy Nick Moran as Aramis, though.

The many moments of derring-do are gratifying, and there's a sense that the story is sacrificed in service of the hard-charging action. I don't know how much of his own stunts were performed by lead actor Justin Chambers. I'm thinking not many, but these are still pretty astonishing stunts. Gene Kelly, when he played D'Artagnan in 1948, performed some excellent tumbling while dueling but his version never approached the sheer athleticism and dazzle of this D'Artagnan. Justin Chambers (or his stunt double) is a whirling dervish, swordfighting with flair and fury, and executing some frenetic gymnastics. As one character observes to D'Artagnan: ""You have an interesting fighting style."" Except I'm fairly certain fencing in 17th century France didn't involve wire work.

Still, Gene Kelly's THE THREE MUSKETEERS is loads better than this one. Heck, even the Charlie Sheen version was better. And for the best film adaptation, you need to get your hands on Richard Lester's THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1973). Regarding THE MUSKETEER, see it, if you must, for the cool fighty fights and maybe for the bits of snark peppered throughout. 2.5 stars out of 5 for this one.",1293926400,,3310,5.045703839122487
1432467,1,B00005JKE1,"In the spirit of public service announcements, I am compelled to write this review.

PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.  IT HAS NO REDEEMING QUALITIES.

Not even Tim Roth can save it.  (Why, Tim Roth, why are you in this ""film""???!!!  If it's money you need, you should have come to me, and I would have PAID YOU not to make it!)

I do not know where to begin to ""review"" this, so I shall begin with d'Artagnan's hat - it is hideous.  As are the other three musketeers, but note that this is ""The Musketeer"" - singular, so expect a lot of solo work from Justin Chambers.  Justin Chambers has a nice face, but it does not belong in this crap either.  The sixty-year-old and apparently barren queen (played by Catherine Deneuve - why, gods, why???!!!) is delightfully prettier than Meena Suvari (whose name is inexplicably ""Francesca"" in this chef d'ouevre of cinema).  There is no plot, only poorly lit, mal-orchestrated excuses for people to flip through the air and slash at things blindly with their swords as if they were being attacked by a murder of crows, instead of human opponents.  There was also apparently not enough money left over (after, presumably, paying all the famous people to be in this) for good cinematography, costumes, art direction, screenwriters, etc.  Have I mentioned the lighting is REALLY BAD?  And the titles look so cheap, as if they were literally stolen from another (possibly 80 year old) movie.

If, for some reason, you do not heed my warning, and DO find yourself watching this film, I recommend you take some Ambien as soon as possible and pray for oblivion.",1291507200,,1593,4.663082437275985
1432468,3,B00005JKE1,"This is not a Three Musketeers movie. It's a D'Artagon movie with  supporting roles for the Three Musketeers. Catherine Deneuve is exquisite, as always. And Tim Roth is, well, Tim Roth. One nasty, psycopathic s.o.b. The stunts and fight scenes could fit very well into a Jackie Chan film. Maybe the Chinese stunt coordinator had something to do with it. Ya think?? The movie it self has lots and lots of action and not as much comedic stuff as past films. Which is good. But, it does have some good comedic banter. Like in the banquet scene, where a woman is inquiring about the length of D'Artagnon ""sword"". Very cheeky indeed.
I think they could have toned down some of the Jackie Chan-esque stunts (Like the scene where D'Artagnon is climbing a tower wall on a rope, while fighting with four or five guys). It's  just too much. But all in all, good action and great sword fighting, an absolute must in ANY Musketeer film, and unfotunately, sorely lacking in most.

Hey, I like my musketeers with a fair helping of daring, a twinkle in the eye, a sense for the droll, and some of that old-time gallantry too, and if directors see fit to take liberties with antique technology and to push the physical limits of human strength, agility and endurance in order to put on a good show then I say go for it and the critics be damned.

And, of course, this is not a film I would expect to be winning critics' awards.  It's all about entertainment.  Crack open your favorite beverage, sit back and take it for what it is.  A galloping romp.  Perhaps not the greatest romp ever filmed, but close enough.

That the film may stray from the Dumas canon is of no consequence to me whatever, and indeed the film's title as much as informs the viewer that we may be going off the well-beaten path.  The acting, in my view, was adequate to its purpose.  Deneuve was Deneuve and the principal cast carried the day.",1262649600,,946,4.329545454545454

(UK/Germany/Luxembourg - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

In 17th century France, a young would-be Musketeer (Justin Chambers) struggles to prevent a plot by Cardinal Richelieu's villainous compatriots to plunge the country into all-out war.

Hoping to ring the changes on Alexandre Dumas' famous novel, director Peter Hyams (CAPRICORN ONE) and screenwriter Gene Quintano (COMIN' AT YA!) combine swashbuckling melodrama with newfangled Hong Kong action techniques, though Quintano's half-hearted script fails to bring anything new to the table EXCEPT its action set-pieces. Former Calvin Klein model Chambers is blank but athletic, and he's overshadowed by spirited co-stars Catherine Deneuve (the Queen of France) and Tim Roth (the villain), alongside Mena Suvari (AMERICAN BEAUTY) as Chambers' potential love interest.

Hyams' strives to recreate the grime and squalor of the period through careful lighting and dcor, though a number of scenes unfold in near-darkness, undermining their dramatic effect. The movie is redeemed, however, by the work of action choreographer Xiong Xin-xin (Yang Hun-hun), a Hong Kong movie veteran with numerous films to his credit (SKINNY TIGER AND FATTY DRAGON, BLACK MASK, TIGER ON BEAT, WONDER SEVEN, TIME AND TIDE, etc.). He's best known for his recurring role in the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series, which may explain why the climax of THE MUSKETEER - a showdown between Chambers and Roth in a room full of stepladders - is basically a replay of the climactic sequence from the first ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA (1991), one of the greatest action set-pieces ever filmed.",1256688000,,1682,5.380228136882129
1432472,3,B00005JKE1,"Please, get off your serious Leonard Maltin high jackasses and enjoy yourselves.  This film bears no resemblance to any of Dumas' works, nor any of the earlier film versions (at least 7), which were tailored either to the leading man/lady or the director's whimsy. I really enjoyed all the crazy swordplay, being a Jackie Chan fan.  The homage to Shanghai Noon, with flying ladders and wild-eyed, one eyed villain, was great fun.
Richard Lester's classic retelling starred English and American actors, none of whom had French accents, and it was not harmed by the Cockney-speaking peasants either.  Les Mis doesn't have the first glimmer of a French accent, and it was written in French!  Lighten up!
When such divers actors as Gene Kelly, Lana Turner, The Ritz Brothers and Chris O'Donnell get away with making films titled The Three Musketeers, no one is in a position to complain when Peter Hyams borrows a familiar character to spin a new tale.  Read the entire Three Musketeers trilogy by Dumas (3M, Twenty Years Later, Ten Years After) and don't look for much, if any, resemblance to the celluloid versions.
The scruffy costumes of the disenfranchised Musketeers, the elaborate court dress, and the (back to Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon) use of torches and candles to light indoor scenes was useful window dressing, but who really cares if it was filmed in Luxembourg, France or Grand Fenwick?
I was amused but not impressed.  But I have seen a lot worse films with bigger stars and more ambitious plots. (Rhymes with plotz, which would be Dumas' reaction to all these films).",1247961600,,1584,4.93609022556391

Having a weak lead actor is not the way to have box-office success. Stupid dialog doesn't help either, along with the Rambo action mentality in which the good guy doesn't get hit from close range.

On the upside, some of the action scenes were spectacular, the best swordplay I've ever seen. The ones at the beginning and the end of the film were the best, with some incredible stunt work.

This movie is beautifully photographed, too. Tim Roth was a good villain, as usual, and the heroes - even if they couldn't act - were fun to watch. The language is tame in here and the film should be rated PG, not PG- 13.",1238112000,,738,4.419117647058823

1432502,2,B00005JKE1,"""The Three Musketeers"" has been a Hollywood movie staple for decades.  2001's ""The Musketeer"" attempted to update the swashbuckling with the latest in special effect and martial arts, and a very tight focus on the character of D'Artagnon and a minimalist retelling of the traditional story.

Justin Chambers plays D'Artagnon as a hunky super-warrior, capable of fantastic feats of martial arts and swordsmanship on par with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  The plot is downplayed in favor of a series of spectacular fights in bars, palaces, and on ropes and ladders.  The fight scenes are exciting, but the lack of plot to link the fights may become a distraction for those familiar with the original story.  The plot complication involving the English Duke of Buckingham and the French Queen, for example, is portrayed in a confusing manner, while the three Musketeers seem to have little to do in the story.  Only Tim Roth as the Cardinal's evil henchman gets a lot of screen, most of that opposite young Artagnon in the fight scenes.  The young and attractive Mena Suvari portrays the Queen's handmaiden and D'Artagnon's love interest, but she plays the role as a rather modern feminist, a little out of synch with D'Artagon's more traditional gallantry.  Catherine Deneuve as the Queen just looks uncomfortable in the role.  It isn't clear why the Duke of Buckingham would have risked an international scandal for her.

This isn't a terrible movie, but viewers should not expect a traditional telling of ""The Three Musketeers.""",1198108800,,1533,5.096
1432503,3,B00005JKE1,"I've never understood the tidal wave of revulsion for The Musketeer. It has a lot of problems - Peter Hyams' typically limited cinematography that rations color like it was wartime, the atrocious swordwork from the blandest bunch of Musketeers ever to have a camera pointed at them, the worst credits sequence of all time and an impressive ladder fight that is really just a reprise of stunt director Xin Xin Xiong's own work in Once Upon a Time in China - but for all that it's an enjoyable romp and David Arnold's unapologetically fullblown romantic score (quite possibly based on his rejected score for Cutthroat Island) is rather splendid. Certainly as modern-day swashbucklers go, it's better than most. The DVD extras are pretty perfunctory though.",1197763200,,754,5.04
1432504,2,B00005JKE1,"I will not review this based on the book, as I was never a big fan of the book anyways, but on the film itself.

Mostly, I simply found most of the characters to be bland and lifeless, with the notible exception of the villian Febre, and the plot and dialogue to be fairly weak and unexciting.

The swordfighting skills displayed in the movie were dazzling, but (as another reviewer also mentioned) considering that everyone appeared almost identicle, it was a little hard to tell at times who was fighting whom. Also, while again the fight scenes were dazzling, there was no practicle reason why some of the more over the top ones were even engaged in. I am referring mostly to the fight outside the tower on ropes (why didn't someone attempt to cut D'Artagnan's rope instead of engaging him in an ariel fencing match?) and the fight on the ladders (why would Febre give up stable ground to fight D'Artagnan on unsure footing?).",1179792000,,929,4.624242424242424
1432505,1,B00005JKE1,"it's just awful. although the movie is allegedly based on a famous novel by dumas (the three musketeers), the movie violates both the spirit and the plot of the original story. There is no Milady, D'Artagnan's young lover does not die, D'Artagnan does not go on a mission to the UK, and so forth and so on.

What makes the movie truly unwatchable is not just the fact that it has little if anything to do with Dumas's masterpiece, but is the fact that the movie is phenomenally poorly scripted and equally poorly acted.

This director has chosen not to trudge down the same old rut. Instead, he's created a story parallel to and interlaced with the classic.

As long as you can take this movie for itself, it's fair entertainment. Deneuve is a lovely as ever; her mature, regal look fits the queen's role perfectly. This is a 21st century flick, so there have to be chase scenes - even though it's horse and carriage stuff, the chase scenes are completely up to date. The adventure and intrigue carry the story along well, with a comedic edge that keeps it from turning into a grim parody.

If you want a light swashbuckler, you came to the right place. If you really wanted the classic Musketeers - well, it's been done and done again. You'll just have to keep looking.

1432535,3,B00005JKE1,"Upon hearing that yet another version of Alexander Dumas' classic tale ""The Three Musketeers"" would be making its way onto the big screen, my friend was just a bit skeptical.
""They're making another one?"" he said in a less than an enthusiastic tone. ""How many times can they remake it?""
Fearing that my friends response may be duplicated by more than a few moviegoers, Universal Pictures made sure that their Musketeer film, ""The Musketeer,"" would be unlike any rendition of Dumas' tale you've ever seen before.
Unfortunately, a little more similarity to other Musketeer movies probably would have propelled ""The Musketeer"" from average movie fare to cinematic classic.
Lest you think this is the same old story you've heard and seen several times before, a swift warning that ""The Musketeer"" is based on the novel by Dumas, not an exact interpretation.
The core element of the novel, a young, would be musketeer plays a pivotal role in stopping the Cardinal and his henchmen from stopping the Kings of England and France from signing a peace treaty is intact, but the rest of the story is hit and miss.
Imagine a Sherlock Holmes movie in which Watson has only a cameo role in the film and you'll begin to have a good idea of where ""The Musketeer"" is heading.
In screenwriter Gene Quintano's adaptation, D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) witnesses the death of his parents and vows to become a Musketeer like his father before him. One of his father's friends trains D'Artagnan in the ways of all things Musketeer and by the time he arrives to Paris to join the King's elite fighting force, he is more than up to the challenge. Everything sounds fine so far, right? Well, here's where things get a bit complicated.
The film doesn't bother with the three incidents in which D'Artagnan first encounters Athos, Aramis and Porthos, resulting in the three pals challenging him in three separate duels. Before D'Artagnan begins his first duel, a band of the Cardinal's men attack and are easily defeated by the musketeers and their newfound friend. Instead, D'Artagnan simply meets Aramis and Porthos who are hard at work on reaching the bottom of their wine bottles while he runs into Athos in a bar, which would could conclude from the film is the Musketeer's sole hangout. Worse, D'Artagnan has to convince the others to assist him in protecting the King, the Musketeer's sworn duty.
By forgoing the pivotal meetings and subsequent battle where the musketeers befriend D'Artagnan, the audience is asked to buy into too much, specifically that the proud musketeers would follow a lowly, albeit brave, commoner.
Also rather hastily paced is D'Artagnan's romance of one of the Queen's handmaidens, Constance (Mena Suvari). The relationship is so poorly developed that it feels like Quinatno threw it in at the last minute as opposed to it being a pivotal aspect of the film.
For the most part, the cast seems overwhelmed by their roles, but that could probably be more attributed to Quinatno's script, which assumes you know enough of the musketeer lore and are more than familiar with the characters.
Catherine Deneuve handles her role as the courageous Queen of France perfectly and Tim Roth (Febre, the Cardinal's main henchman) as always is superb in the villain role. Roth practically carries the movie on his own and at least makes you care when he finally gets his comeuppance.
Chambers is merely adequate as D'Artagnan, but it may be fairer to say the script doesn't give him a lot to work with in terms of really capturing the hearts of the audience.
The film's advertising focuses heavily on the fact that Hong Kong choreographer Xin Xin Xiong designed the fight sequences.
Director Peter Hyams does an outstanding job capturing all the action and keeps the movie moving at an even pace. The fights are indeed dazzling, but make up such a minimal part of the movie that they're not as epic as the commercials would lead you to believe.
The costumes make it hard to distinguish who's who when there's more than two people fighting on the screen at one time as well.
Remember how everyone began using ""The Matrix""-type special effects after the success of the 1999 Keanu Reeves action film? With the raves of the fight scenes in ""Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon,"" don't be surprised if mid-air flights become commonplace on the big screen. There are some moments when you may experience d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, but for the most part, the action scenes are completely original.
""The Musketeer"" is a movie with great action, effects and a likable cast that's just begging for a better story to replace the script, providing a new look at Dumas' classic that no one was clamoring for. Ironically, in this case, a better story was written. It just wasn't used.",1123113600,,4751,4.888475836431227

I mean it's written by the guy who created the Police Academy franchise. Surely he should be blacklisted in Hollywood by now.

Peter Hyams once again becomes his own cinematographer and does a kinda okay job. None of his trademark flair or wonderful use of widescreen is in this film and nothing really comes across as pretty or atmospheric. And this whole deal with the film apparently having an Eastern influence is total nonsense. There is like 2 fight scenes and neither of them are that spectacular and come across as a bit contrived. Just because an Asian guy did the choreography it doesn't mean that this film has to look like The Matrix.

The actors do what they can with the poor story and limp dialogue but still come across as being bored, especially Stepehen Rea. Tim Roth looks and acts like a cross between Chuck Norris and Charles Dance and his character is a bit of a clich. 'The Man in Black'...puh-lease. And if you're kinda wondering who that is playing Mena Suvari's evil uncle then you might recognise him as Arthur Fowler from long over-running BBC1 misery and despair soap Eastenders.

The Musketeer also seems to be badly edited around the PG-rating. Obviously this is what the studio wanted to aim for but it just seem right given the tone of the film and any scene in which someone dies looks like a badly staged pantomime. Even Dogtanian and the Three Muskahounds was more grown-up than this. And boy are those opening credits ugly!

1432539,3,B00005JKE1,"Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea), in his quest to become the premier power in France, disbands the king's musketeers and does his best to wipe them out, discretely, of course.  One of the musketeers killed was D'Artagnan's (Justin Chambers) father and D'Artagnan vows to avenge his father's death and kill the man in black (Tim Roth).  D'Artagnan grows up and begins his quest for vengeance by traveling to Paris and contacting the musketeers.  Unfortunately, he fails his test and instead finds himself aiding the Queen (Catherine Deneuve) in a desperate attempt to avoid war with Great Britain.  Along the way, D'Artagnan falls in love with Francesca bon Ansau (Mena Suvari) and gradually earns the respect of the musketeers.
I quite enjoyed this version of the Three Musketeers, but I would have to agree with other reviewers in that it is not the best version that I have seen.  The strength of this movie is the amazing fighting sequences.  Whether it is a barroom brawl with the fighters dancing over barrels, an attempt to take over the Queen's coach that leaps from coach to horse to ground, or a winner take all fight on ropes and ladders, the fighting sequences are fresh, original and oftentimes, simply amazing.  The costumes and scenery were gorgeous, with the director Peter Hymans' fabulous use of natural light to give the whole film a faded, sepia toned look that really suited the time period.  The supporting cast was quite good, including a deliciously evil man in black played by Tim Roth and an understated, yet humorous musketeer trio played by Nick Moran (Aramis), Steven Spiers (Porthos) and Jan Gregor Kremp (Athos).  The absolute worst part of the film was Justin Chambers, who, unfortunately played D'Artagnan and was in just about every scene.  It is true that Justin, a ex-Calvin Klein model, is quite beautiful, at least he is without that ridiculous long hair that he sported in the film, and it it also true that he is quite athletic and did a fine job on his stunt work, but, sadly, he cannot act and he cannot speak French.

The single most thing that really ruined this movie for me was the acting... (or lack thereof)  This is what you get when you cast a pretty-boy model who's never acted before and expect him to carry the film in a lead role.  The rest of the actors were  unknowns or hardly-knowns who didn't perform much better than he did.  Even the prestigious roles of Porthos, Athos, and Aramis were demoted down to bit parts and played by extras... Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but were you familiar with any one of those actors who were playing the Musketeers?

What prevented this movie from being a total disaster was the cool action scenes plus the magnificent scenery.  Still, it has to be one of the most disappointing musketeer films ever.  If you decide to watch it, just imagine talented famous actors playing the parts and it won't be so bad after all.",1070582400,3,1032,4.565217391304348
1432543,2,B00005JKE1,"The Musketeer could have been so good. The locations and sets are so beautiful and there are some beautiful fight scenes.  However, those fight scenes are a part of the problem.  Wire action is used, but instead of the beautiful grace of Chinese wire actions movies, the action here is a little too speedy and choppy.  Also a lot of the fight scenes include moves that seem unnecessarily flashy and impractical--for example, doing a full split on two barrels while fighting a swordsman.  Just unnecessary.  I think the director wanted the audience to say, ""Cool!"", but instead they just say, ""Huh?""
Another bad point is the acting.  There are no good performances in this movie.  Everyone seems to be reading their lines.  All of the parts are miscast.  The heros have no charisma, and the villians have no menace.  Another thing that really bothered me was that half the actors have American accents and half have French accents.

1432574,3,B00005JKE1,"GREAT FILMS: The director/producers take the time to ensure the movie looks good, plays good, sounds good, and spins the audience into its web of wonder. All scenes are intact, with all pickup shots (close-ups, transitionary moments, shots of what the actor is looking at, shots of things unseen by the regular camera that are neccessary to let the audience know what is going unseen).
THE MUSKETEER is not a great film. It is a good film that is missing many elements that could have made it a GREAT film.
THE MUSKETEER is an interesting movie with nice - yeah just NICE - action sequences. Much more could have been accomplished as I found that these ""action"" scenes were fairly predictable.
The acting is decent yet could have used a little more gusto. The characters seem to take way too many things for granted, leaving much unexplained in the sense that everyone knows all about the reasoning behind the motivation and why things are happening... This portrays the entire cast as shallow vessels, and opens up the can of worms reminding the audience that this is JUST a movie.
I believe the following problems lead to the boredom I found myself enraptured within while viewing the second and third parts of the film (even though the beginning was pretty lame).
THE SCORE. Where is the thrill? I believe that with a much better score that drove the action and story, this film could have been much better.
THE MISSING SCENES. Near the middle of the film it is hinted that the lead, D'ARTAGNAN, has a history with his horse. We have seen no evidence of this. The writers and directors could have incorporated a short scene showing how D'artagnan bonds with the horse who becomes a companion and friend to him. The first time we see the horse, he is tagged to the back of the wagon fighting to keep up as they race away from the bad guys.
There are also several moments - pick ups - that are missing. I think the director went after a ""Quick CUT"" style for this movie to keep the action flowing. This film, however, is not suited for such a drastic style. Transitions and little things that are missing throw the audience off guard, as we are suddenly in the midst of another scene of dialogue or action. This happens too many times throughout the film and makes me wonder if they just ran out of time/budget and cut together what was done and left it at that. NOT A GOOD THING.
THE DVD EXTRAS. Laughable. Redundant. Laughable. Redundant. There is the ""Production notes"" which are simply a type-up of all the words spoken in all of the video extras which include, ""Casting Justin Chambers"" - a sixty second clip of the model-turned-actor talking about the movie and how it was a great experience. Then there is ""The Stunts"" - a less than five minute dialogue with the director talking about the wonders of the Stunt Coordinator, with nearly all of the ""Casting Justin Chambers"" footage clipped in as filler. The ""Theatrical Trailer"" is amusing in how they sliced and diced the more interesting aspects of the film into a promo piece that outshines the film itself. And why in the world do they bother to put ""Widescreen anamorphic format"" on there anyway? It is NOT an extra. It is the format of the film that - in my opinion - should be the only format they allow.
A good film? Yeah.
A great experience? No.
A good plot? Sure.
Good sound? Heck NO!
A good rental? Maybe...
Should you buy it? I do not encourage you.
All for one and one for all? Nope.
Overall, 3 stars is a generous rating. I enjoyed moments of this film. I am glad I did not waste my money in the theatres watching it.

Justin Chambers had the look to play D'Artagnan, but he left his emotions at the door.  Stephen Rhea was horrible as Richelieu.  His delivery was flat and emotionless.  Thank God for Tim Roth.  He was the only bright spot in this film.  You just want to hate the guy for who he is and how crazily mean he is.  The action sequences are okay at best, but I wasn't amazed by any of it.

And, would everyone please stop comparing remakes to what they think are originals.  The Lester films of the Seventies were remakes too, and bear more resemblance to Monty Python than to Dumas.

1432578,1,B00005JKE1,"I think it is admirably quirky that they tried to graft a Hong Kong martial arts movie style onto a 17th Century ""Three Musketeers"" knockoff, but the final product here is flat out awful, and should never have been released. From the first, the stunts might have been cool, but the editing of the fighting scenes is so bad they are unappreciable, and it's often difficult to figure out what's going on. The whole ladder climax was so blatantly [borrowed] from Great Hero From China that even that couldn't offer a tiny shred of redemption.
The thing is just barely watchable. If this was made in 1985, it might make for a funny bad rental, but this thing came out in 2001! Bad direction, miserable acting, horrible editing, and one of the most ineptly written scripts equals one big stinkbomb from start to finish.
First of all, the miscasting was at such a level it is hard to believe it wasn't deliberate. Justin Chambers is, frankly, horrible in this role; I can't hypothesize what kind of role in which he might not be horrible. All of the other actors and their characters are ludicrous and instantly forgettable, except for Tim Roth, who had the decency to be a goof off. Chambers' ""mentor"" reminded me of Andre the Giant's character from the Princess Bride, and we never get to understand how this supposedly incredible swordfighter kid was trained by an overweight guy with bad lungs who rarely moves.
The script was just appalling. The ""wooing"" scenes between Chambers and Suvari were, of course, miserably acted, but the dialogue itself was just embarrassing. You will cringe. The overall plot is ridiculously superficial, yet they still manage to make it a total mess of head-scratchingly bad ideas. That Cardinal Richelieu would have ever hatched plots of such idiocy is inconceivable. He was a schemer to the core, which Dumas always portrayed wonderfully, but ultimately his schemes were designed to enhance the power of the throne and his authority over the king, not undermine it and try and get countries to declare war on France. There's no point listing the rest of its absurdities.
Although this was billed as a quasi-martial arts flick, there are really only a few genuine fight scenes, and again, they are badly edited (way too many confusing cuts and obvious speed-motion edits) and it's pretty clear that Chambers did almost none of his own stunts. Hyams should not be directing action flicks.
The music poorly corresponded to anything on screen, and since I hate this movie, I might as well hate the music too. It was dreadful. Also, the transfer to VHS was awful; for the first half-hour it looked dullish and yellow, and everything sounded flat. Maybe the DVD is better.
Dumas' original ""The Three Musketeers"" was obviously a wonderful novel, but none of the hilarious interplay between the Musketeers manages to find a way into the script. Aramis, Porthos, and Athos were instead lifeless dolts with no wit, even for the little time they were on screen. The reason they keep making movies from Dumas' novels is that they were fantastic, well-written stories that have endured through the ages. Somehow, the movie versions almost always manage to then abuse them into barely recognizable mushes of hackwork. I know this movie was designed for 12 year olds, but they deserve a lot more credit than to have to endure this pandering, half-hearted miscarriage of a movie.",1051315200,3,3394,4.873702422145329
1432579,3,B00005JKE1,"""The Musketeer"" is a dark telling of the Alexander Dumas classic ""The Three Musketeers""; not dark in the sense of brooding and foreboding, but dark in the sense that most of the scenes are under lit big time.  My guess is that it is easier to hide the wirework under such circumstances, but maybe director Peter Hyams thought he was being artistic.
The hook with this film is that the fight choreographer is by Xin-Xin Xiong (who also does stunt work for Tim Roth's character in the climatic fight).  This is clearly going to be a make it or break it issue for most viewers, as to whether they are going to buy Hong Kong action sequences in a film with King Louis XIII.  I am open to such things in theory but reserve judgment until I see them in practice, and the first big sequence in the film is the best as D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) takes on an inn full of swordsmen, fighting two or three at a time, while dodging over and dancing on barrels.  The initial part is pretty good, but then there is stuff involving the ceiling and the big fight at the finish is more about ladders than it is about swords (although the end is really an old school clich).  So the action sequences are okay, given that the best one comes first.
The part where I worried about ""The Musketeer"" is when the credit rolled and the names Catherine Deneue as the Queen, Mena Suvari as Francesca bon Ansau, Stephen Rea as Cardinal Richelieu, and Tim Roth as Febre the Man in Black, before we get to former Calvin Klein model Justin Chambers as D'Artagnan (good look, no act).  Now, Deneue is a big name but this is not her movie.  These first five names also make it very clear why the title of this film is not ""The Three Musketeers"" (there have been 20 of those anyway), because Aramis (Nick Moran), Porthos (Steve Speirs), and Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp) are just supporting characters in this version.  This leads us to the biggest problem with this film, which is that screenwriter Gene Quintano goes out of his way to make this story different. Maybe the assumption is that the target audience will not know the original story.  Besides making the other Musketeers minor characters, the biggest change is that Febre is now the major villain, breaking off the leash of Cardinal Richelieu, turning the master power politician into a sputtering bystander.  But once you throw out the book, why should a little thing like history concern anyone?
Ultimately, ""The Musketeer"" is another one of those films where the trailer is better than the movie (maybe they should let the people who make the trailers make the movies).  The DVD extras are nothing special, although I would have thought that if you were going to do a featurette on the fight sequences you should actually get into the fight sequences.  Otherwise we are right back to trumpeting the fact that this is ""The Three Musketeers"" told with Hong Kong action sequences.  That should have been the starting point for this film, not the end point.",1046822400,,2981,4.5913370998116765

What is the definitive filming of Dumas' ""The Three Musketers?""

Aramis? Whats this? A gay, gypsy looking Aramis? Pathetic.. and who is the actor that plays him? Terrible!
Athos? .... Athos was a drunk and nothing but that? Again... read the book! Athos was a very strong presence in the book, here... hes just part of the scenery.
The only good actor i saw here was Tim Roth, ...he plays the role very nicely,...
Cardinal Richeliau... well.. no comments here.. as he gone completely numb.. or somekind of gay? [Poor] acting from a very respectable actor unfortunately.

1432637,1,B00005JKE1,"Peter Hyams explains his version of the oft-told Dumas tale as a ""re-vision"" of The Three Musketeers. (The hyphen in the word ""re-vision"" is not mine, it is included in all the accompanying literature associated with the Miramax release. Mr. Hyams does not explain why the story needs to be re-vised. Yet, after dozens of works of fiction, including stage, movie, television, radio drama, pantomime, ballet, orchestral works and point-of-purchase candy bar display racks, somehow Hollywood has determined that what keeps this classic swashbuckling product from selling is its story. So it gets re-vised. God save us all from the re-vision thing.
Just to bring you up on the Hyams version of the story: D'Artagnan, the only son of a retired Gascon musketeer, is orphaned as a boy, as his celebrated father is just beginning to teach him the ultra-deadly Hong Kong style of epe swordsmanship that once made the old musketeer famous fighting for Charles IV against the Yakuza. Both D'Artagnan's parents are killed before his very eyes by the evil Tim Roth and his faction of cardinalist guards. Tim Roth, who ranks with Phyllis Diller's characterization in The Bugaloos as a Saturday morning cartoon villain, might better be remembered for his identical role in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, in which he masticated entire soundstages and set pieces before this reviewer's horrified eyes, and performed the most offensive rape scene ever perpetrated by a major Hollywood release.
This D'Artagnan is an orphan, who is raised by his father's servant Planchet. This Planchet is a master demolitions expert and Chinese-style swordsman, who, while disguised as Noel Redding from the Jimi Hendrix Experience, teaches D'Artagnan everything he needs to know about being a musketeer. This apparently would include how to fight when suspended from a guy wire, how to attach an German epe guard and hilt to a Chinese sword, and how to passably mimic either a French or British accent. It is only this last skill that eludes D'Artagnan before it his time for him to seek his fortune in Paris and meet M. de Treville, captain of the king's musketeers.
This M. Treville is a doddering old fool, whose musketeers are in disgrace after they are framed for doing the exact kind of thing the American CIA was doing in Central and South America during the 1960s and 1970s. After meeting the sodden Porthos and Aramis, whose characters in this ""re-vision"" have been reduced to one-dimensional mercenaries straight out of the movie ConAir, this D'Artagnan find lodgings with this M. Bonacieux - who is the uncle of the pretty young Bonacieux this time around. I can't find a more likely reason for this plot change than to make M. Bonacieux more repulsive, but Bill Treacher does a fair job of that on his own. The pretty young Bonacieux (played by young ingenue Mena Suvari with all the emotional depth of a Clinique ad) now has the given name of Francesca and is of Spanish descent this time around, also is now unmarried and is on the cover of Cosmo for reasons that escape me.
Several key characterizations are absent in the three famous musketeers themselves. They are drunken, ill-disciplined, scheming and without respect to women, true enough, but here their similarities to the Dumas characters end. That is where the characters themselves end, since they are given no courage, no thirst for justice, and no unwavering loyalty to king and to France that made them so compelling in the first place. Instead, we have in all of the musketeers generally, a sort of defeated rabble to be roused by D'Artagnan's youthful idealism.
Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea, ""you mean they really couldn't get Tim Curry again?""), the classic arch villain and traditionally the venomous creature at the center of  this classic web of action and intrigue, has been reduced to an impotent second banana when faced with Tim Roth's over-the-top LeFebre.
(LeFebre? LeFebre? the critic and student of French popular literature cries as he thumbs through his dog-eared translation of The Three Musketeers, finally realizing that this character, the central villain, doesn't even exist in the book! And why should he, really, when there are already a number of villains and ne'er-do-wells who would serve just as well? )
Gone is Jussac. Gone is Lady Clarik De Winter, and the main motivation for Athos and D'Artagnan. Rochefort is a walk-on, dust beneath the feet of this impostor LeFebre. Gone is the romantic intrigue between Lord Buckingham and Queen Anne. D'Artagnan has no internal turmoil over being infatuated with the wife of his landlord, since she's now his niece, quite available, and willing. Gone is the story.
Gone is the action, too; largely due to Hyams shooting all fight scenes from the torso up, which makes it impossible to figure out and who is actually fighting whom. A potentially brilliant piece of combat business involving sword combat while perched atop, and occasionally leaping from, 25-foot tall ladders becomes tedious and poorly realized, like a scene out of MacGyver. Justin Chambers is given lines that would embarrass the writers of Who's the Boss? and everything involving battle from a carriage was lifted nearly shot by shot from Stagecoach.
The Musketeer is not entirely without merit, although specific examples of where that might be true elude me. Costumes and weapons are noticeable in their tawdriness, and what should be an important state dinner honoring the presence of Lord Buckingham in the court of Louis XIII looks more like the $50-a-plate Royale Banquet deal at your local renaissance festival. (And when is Hollywood going to realize that a four-pound cannon does not shoot an incendiary firework that makes its victims do cartwheels on impact? It shoots molten-hot grapeshot, a particularly deadly cluster of projectiles that goes through the victim's flesh, carving its victims into small, difficult-to-identify pieces.)  However, since the screenplay did away with the entire plot and characters of its original material, it's a pretty easy story for the average 8 year old to follow, so it does have that going for it.",1029369600,6,6135,5.0672601384767555

""The Musketeer"" follows the same, basic story that all of its predecessors have already done. Sadly, most better them are better than this one.
But there are two saving graces for this movie. First is Justin Chambers, who stars as D'Artagnan. There is a freshness that Mr. Chambers brings to the movie, which is more obvious when compared to the staleness that is the rest of the movie. The second saving grace is the choreography of the fight scenes. Fight choreographer Xiong Xin Xin, of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" fame, brings a fluidic movement to D'Artagnan's fight scenes.
Feel free to rent this movie once. The fight scenes and Justin Chambers will make it worth it. But don't add it to your collection until you've seen it first, because chances are that this movie would only end up serving as a doorstop.",1026172800,,843,4.780821917808219
1432640,2,B00005JKE1,"By any standard, this is a very strange movie.  The fight scenes are quite remarkable, but because they seem more appropriate in THE MATRIX or CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or, even, SHREK, they seem bizarrely out of place in this film.  They also make the rest of the film look all that much worse than it would have otherwise.  It is worth noting that the fight scenes were the product of Xin Xin Xiong, whose background is in Asian martial arts films.
Numerous reviewers have noted the absurdity of the script, especially in that it changes the story of Alexandre Dumas.  To tell the truth, the original story isn't so terribly special that some emendation is out of order.  The trouble is that the changes that are introduced do not produce a good story.  So, it is quite true that one of the great faults of the film is a very bad script.
A more serious problem is the acting, especially in several of the key roles.  Based on his wooden, monotone performance in this film (an amazing achievement considering all the action in this one), Justin Chambers would have to compete for the title of the world's worst actor.  The only other thing I have seen him in was THE WEDDING PLANNER, in which he was the most irritating element as Jennifer Lopez's would-be Italian fiance.  He was bad in that, but he is far, far worse in this film.  Tim Roth is a talented guy, but has anyone noticed how many bad films he is in?  And how many ham roles he gets?  Basically, his role in this film is essentially a rehash of his Oscar-nominated role in ROB ROY.  Stephen Rea is more or less wasted as Cardinal Richelieu.  The portrayal of Richelieu in films has always perplexed me.  He is almost universally portrayed as a villain, and yet he is easily one of the most important figures in French political history, providing important national leadership at a time of crisis in the monarchy.  Certainly he was not any more ruthless than many other strong national leaders in the seventeenth century.  Mena Suvari is not cut out for costume pictures, and while she seems perfectly in her element in AMERICAN BEAUTY and the AMERICAN PIE films, she just doesn't belong here.
The film did look good, and whoever was in chart of art direction did a bang up job.  But good looking sets and great fighting sequences cannot in themselves make a good picture.  Not a very successful film at all.",1026000000,2,2377,4.563679245283019

1432674,3,B00005JKE1,"On the surface, ""The Musketeer"" has a good central idea: Take Dumas' classic swashbuckling tale and add a touch of modern Hong Kong wire work to the action. Described like that, it's easy to see what was intended: Soaring, even transcendant action, battles that are as much dance as they are combat, and a shot in the arm to a nearly dead genre.
It didn't quite turn out that way.
It has been said that too many cooks can spoil the soup, and here, we see too many ideas doing the same. ""The Musketeer"" rolls together too-little wire work, a grubbily accurate recreation of the period (which means the film is so dark that you miss much of the action), a special focus on D'Artagnan over the rest of the Musketeers, a stellar cast (Tim Roth as Fabre is better than the rest of the film combined) and a script that was clearly intended to ignore almost all of the above assets, putting the focus on the poorly lit and poorly shot action. (Seriously, did anyone immediately understand what happened to Fabre at the end?) Toss in a lead played by an underwear model who can't pronounce his character's name, and you've got big trouble right here in Paris city.
Done well, audiences can forgive much of the silliness of swashbuckling films (they did so as recently as the Antonio Bandaras ""Mask of Zorro""), but in a film like ""The Musketeer"" scenes of soldiers repelling down a tower to get at D'Artagnan instead of, I don't know, just CUTTING THE ROPES become maddening instead.
A film that desperately wants to be ""The Matrix"" instead comes off as yet another tired film attempting to cash in on the craze for Hong Kong-style action it helped create.

1432677,1,B00005JKE1,"This has to be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. So, if you're expecting the film to resemble Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers, the classic novel on which the movie is based, you will be sadly mistaken. (Dumas, on the other hand, must be turning in his grave.) The opening credits should have been a clue for what was to come because instead of being pulled into the film I felt as though I were being lulled to sleep. I don't know what the director or editor was thinking by flashing pictures on the screen during the opening credits because for a moment there I thought I was watching a slide show.

The script itself was far from intriguing because it droned on much like the monotone delivery of leading actor Justin Chambers. Worse still, because Chambers didn't have a French accent he couldn't even pronounce his own character's name, D'Artagnan, correctly. So, the authenticity of the movie was immediately questioned because of this glaring oversight. (Chambers began his career as a model. Surely he could have invested some of his money on a vocal coach.)

Speaking of unconvincing-the fight scenes were highly forgettable not only because of the choreography, but because of the directing. The sequences felt so rushed that the audience barely had enough time to absorb the choreography. In addition, a few of the stunts reminded me of the gravity defying feats often seen on episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess. The most hilarious spectacle, however, had to be the final fight scene-a laughable duel on teetering ladders. I thought this was supposed to be a period piece, not a fantasy movie.

The only thing that made the film tolerable was the convincing 17th century atmosphere that was created by the constant use of torch lighting, the beautiful wardrobe collection, and the sets. Other than that, the screenplay was bland, the leading actor was unexciting, and the fight scenes were unsatisfying. (I still can't believe it was released on DVD.

But I DID expect to be entertained, and the movie failed that expectation miserably. The plot completely failed to engage me...to put it simply, it just wasn't exciting. I spent the majority of the movie wondering when it would be over and I could go home (and for the record, if I had paid for the ticket, I would have demanded my money back). The fight scenes were okay, I suppose, if you could get past the incongruity of a Frenchman of that time period mastering martial arts, but they were brief and poorly filmed. I might consider tempering my review with the fact that I don't really care that much for mindless action movies if it weren't for the fact that my boyfriend, who does like mindless action movies, found this movie as boring as I did.
The scenery and the costumes were good, and Justin Chambers isn't bad on the eyes despite his lack of acting ability, and good actors like Tim Roth, Catherine Deneuve, Mena Suvari, and Stephen Rea turned in decent performances despite the poor lack of material to work with, but overall this movie was a waste of film.",1020038400,2,1348,4.620833333333334

The finale sword fight on ladders between Roth and Chambers (their stunt doubles) is of course the highlight of the film but it's over before you know it and I'm still not quite sure how the bad guy died, I'm assuming by sword.  I expected Roth to carry the film but that was asking too much.  He is still the most exciting character in the film but that isn't saying much, considering the competition.  Actually, I was thinking he might use one of those ladders in the final fight to climb out of the movie!  Mena Suvari (American Beauty) plays the love interest for Chambers. There is no reason why they should be together except he's the best looking guy around and she's the only girl in town and they don't waste anytime putting her in a bath tub again either.  My favorite part is when she is shot in the chest almost point blank range when ""taking one"" for the Queen and in the next scene, she's fine.  The weird part is I didn't feel much sympathy for her when she was shot.  Actually, I felt more sympathy for D'Artagnan's horse when it fell over from exhaustion.  It doesent help that the whole 3 Musketeer ""All for one..."" thing is done in a tired predictable fashion in movies.  Its definitely getting old seeing  french Musketeers with american accents!  Now the Musketeers are flying and sticking to the ceiling and it still didn't help that much!

1432718,1,B00005JKE1,"Dear Makers of the Musketeer:
So you tout yourself for having superb action sequences - okay, I'm interested.  So you say I should see your movie because it's the same choreographer doing YOUR fights as The Matrix - now I'm intrigued.  Then you hire Tim Roth, who is a God among actors. And now I'm hooked.  OH YES PLEASE MAY I SEE YOUR MOVIE ?
Then you do 4 VERY bad things.
1) YOU SPEND NO MONEY ON CINEMATOGRAPHY.  Whoever lit this movie should be shaken . . . repeatedly.  Somebody thought it would be artistic to film this movie in ""Natural Lighting"".  Too bad that some of the scenes are so damn dark you can't see anything at all.  You guys were WAY too interested in making pretty shots and not at all interested in whether or not I can actually SEE them.
2) YOUR EDITOR IS PROBABLY THREE.  No, that's insulting to toddlers everywhere.  Whomever it was that put this film together has issues - he/she must be spastic.  It's great that you put in all these wonderful fight scenes - it's great that you used your entire budget to choreograph everything, but at least film the stupid movie so that I can watch the scenes without the camera moving angles 57 times.  It was jarring.  You see the fight from one angle - something cool happens - then the camera abruptly cuts to a face shot.  Action is flying everywhere BUT THEY'RE FILMING THE LOOK ON THE ACTOR'S FACE.  WHY?????  WHY?????  Trust me, the acting wasn't good enough to warrant filming their faces!
3) YOU HAVE NO SCRIPT.  Storyline-wise, you have a bunch of drunken, disorderly Musketeers who are very sad because the king has disbanded them.  Suddenly, just because the hero says so, they all follow him like rats and the Pied Piper!  Wheeeeee!  Wish life was that easy.  And the dialogue . . . don't get me started.
4) YOU WASTE TIM ROTH.  In reality, you had a pretty good cast.  But when you give them no script, don't inspire them, and under-pay them, they give wooden performances.  And you wonder why?  The only interesting actor among them was Tim Roth, and his lines were so cruddy that it was difficult to appreciate him.  That's just heinous - sinful.  Bad.
This movie was such an abomination, and to think I actually looked forward to it.  Please, Please don't make another movie like this EVER again.  I don't think I could live through the hype and the hideous product.  Really.  It brought tears to my eyes.  Yuck.",1017014400,4,2396,4.487238979118329

Some people have praised the fight sequences, but I found them lacking for the most part, and laughable in others--esp. the men on ropes on the castle's turret, and in the room full of ladders. Why were there so many ladders there anyway? Most disturbing were the inconsistencies in the plot.  Why doesn't the hero make it back to the queen BEFORE the bad guys whom he beats up at the river scene?  Why does he ride to Paris rather than to the ferry, where he could have saved Lord Buckingham and foiled the cardinal's plot?  Why was this movie even made??

Others have praised the fighting, but really, you can see better fighting in better movies. The fights range from no-skills brawling (for example, knocking out two men with two punches to the face, or beating down two swordsmen with a tree branch) to Hong Kong-style acrobatics. But then, it wasn't even close to the acrobatics you can find in Iron Monkey (from 1993, directed by  Yuen Woo-ping) in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or in Jet Li's Fist of Legend. Those kinds of stunts fit nicely in the Asian culture but look strange in 17th century France.
Are we really supposed to believe that overweight slob taught D'Artagnan how to fight like that? And in the end, Tim Roth might have won the fight if he'd spent more time fencing and less time jumping around on ladders like a circus clown. See Iron Monkey instead!",1015804800,,979,4.691860465116279
1432753,3,B00005JKE1,"Alexandre Dumas' classic novel of swashbuckling derring-do, ""The Three Musketeers"" has long been a favorite of film-makers ever since the silent days of Douglas Fairbanks.  From the definitive version with Michael York, Oliver Reed and Faye Dunaway to the extremely campy Disney version with Tim Curry and Charlie Sheen, this tale never ceases to entertain. This latest version uses the old revenge sub-plot in which young D'artagnan (Justin Chambers) not only seeks to become a Musketeer, but avenge his parents' murder at the hands of the villianous Febre' (Tim Roth). In an attempt to ""freshen up"" the classic adventure, director Peter Hyams uses the classic fight choreography of martial arts specialist Xin-Xin Xiong.  In that regard, the movie is a success as the fight sequences are quite amazing.  However, the screenplay ignores the rich characters of Dumas' plot while basically reducing the classic trio of Athos, Porthos and Aramis to little more than minor supporting roles.  If the role of D'artagnan had been played by a strong actor, it might've worked.  However, a rather bland and flat performance by Justin Chambers in the lead as the heroic D'artagnan nearly sinks the entire enterprise.  While he looks the part and handles the action scenes well, Chambers seems to have left all emotion on the cutting-room floor. As a result, Mena Suvari tries hard as his love interest, but has nowhere to go. As for the other Musketeers, only Steven Spiers as Porthos comes across with any sense of depth.  Jean-Pierre Castaldi provides light humor as the wry mentor/servant Planchet.  Catherine Deneuve is a regal delight as the Queen, while Stephen Rea is solid in his role as the crafty Cardinal Richeleu.  Tim Roth is sneering perfection as the sinister Febre', despite the fact that his eyepatch has long become a cliche' in Musketeer filmmaking.  Hyams directs the whole thing with a sure hand and is mostly successful in presenting the time period of the story.  It's a shame that Chamber's performance drags this film down so much as this flick had a lot of potential. If you enjoy fight choreography, I do recommend this film.  But if you want to see this story done right in all respects, see the 2 part Michael York films: THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE FOUR MUSKETEERS.",1015804800,5,2287,4.973753280839895
1432754,1,B00005JKE1,"The tagline on the theatrical poster for ""The Musketeer"" proclaims: ""As you've never seen it before!"" We can only pray that we never see it this way again. This updated, revisionist version of the classic Alexander Dumas novel, ""The Three Musketeers"", manages to eviscerate the story without putting in its place anything interesting or entertaining. This is the kind of movie that gives historical epics a bad name.
It's the early 1600s in France. D'Artagnan's [Justin Chambers] parents are killed in front of him when he is a little boy. He does manage to wound the assailant, who gets away. The kid vows to join the Musketeers, a group of swordsmen who protect the king of France, and find the killer. Fourteen years later, he arrives in Paris to fulfill his destiny. The Musketeers, however, aren't what they used to be. They sit around and drink a lot because the powerful Cardinal Richelieu has ordered them to stop doing their jobs. It seems the Cardinal [Stephen Rea] has plans to overthrow the king and also to instigate a war with England [or is it Spain?] D'Artagnan tries to rouse the lethargic Musketeers into helping him to save France from the Cardinal and his evil henchman, Febre [Tim Roth], who also happens to be the man our hero is looking for. It takes D'Artagnan most of the movie to figure out who Febre is, possibly because he spends much of his time pursuing the lovely Francesca [Mena Suvari].
I've noted in past reviews how tricky it is to make a good historical epic. Accuracy has to be altered somewhat to make the movie understandable and/or entertaining. ""The Musketeers"" manages to throw out all historical truths and still not be fun, plausible or very comprehensible. The movie portrays the king, Louis XIII, as weak and Richelieu as a power hungry back stabber. In fact, Richelieu was France's Prime Minister and the king's ally against the French Huguenots and, for that matter, most of the rest of Europe. He thwarted plots against the throne rather than instigated them. The movie portrays the king as such a foolish fop that it's easy to see the Musketeers as not even wanting to go back to work. All this makes D'Atagnan's attempts to rouse them seem somewhat unbelievable.
Someone decided it would be cool to bring in a famous Chinese martial arts choreographer to stage a lot of Kung Fu style fights, a la ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This requires the actors to do a lot of jumping around, doing stuff that was as physically impossible then as it is today. These stunts work in a movie that is surreal or is just plain fun, but ""The Musketeer"" is so dark and plodding that these sequences seem tacked on and very obviously staged. Instead of being exhilarating, they are, for the most part, simply irritating.
The acting ranges from mediocre to dreadful. There are some fine actors here [Roth, Suvari, Stephen Rea, Catherine Deneuve], but they seem bored with that's going on. Chambers seems to have few acting skills. If he's lucky, he can fill in after Steven Segal retires.
Coincidentally, I have seen two other historical epics recently, both of which were great. One is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", which has wonderful acting and a script that places story and character over action. The other is ""The Brotherhood of the Wolf"", a French film with tons of marvelously choreographed fight scenes, many of them also with a Far East flavor. Neither of them is on DVD yet. If I were you, I wait until they are and avoid this pathetic Musketeer.",1015632000,3,3491,4.752883031301483

With weak screenwriting and poor dialogue, the audience will find itself silently groaning over poorly delivered, predictable lines and wondering if the director's intention was humor or high drama.
Poor editing can be found throughout the film and even the most casual viewer will notice inconsistencies.
The action sequences, which add some fresh intensity to the film, ocassionally leave much to be desired. Obvious time compression in action scenes can leave an audience expecting blockbuster-quality seqences disappointed.

Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore!
While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor!  He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.
This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably.  Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network.

Setting this plot in 16th century France is not necessarily a bad idea, but promoting it as any kind of adaptation of Dumas' _The Three Musketeers_ is utter hogwash. Some of the character names are the same is all, and it does D'Artangnan and co. a great disservice to associate them with this ... .
The performances are wooden, perhaps due to the utterly unmoving and meaningless script, which features numerous unnecessary lines intended to cover up that nothing is actually happening here. Justin Chambers, in particular, has no sense of timing, but rushes into every line as though he can't bear to have anyone else speaking. The action segments are overdone and most of them are filmed in such dark environments that you can't tell what's going on anyway. Attention to detail is non-existent, as in the case of the near-foundered horse who ten minutes and a journey halfway across France later is ready to charge into battle.

I love Hong Kong action films, and I have seen many an actor fly across the screen in wire-fu action.  Xin Xin Xiong is billed as a ""legendary"" fight master even though this is only the 3rd film he has choreographed.

Wirework is excessive to the point where it seems that gravity is non-existent. The actors don't seem to want to be IN this film either, which is clearly reflected by their pained facial expressions as they deliver their incoherent dialogue. Even the cinematography is bad - sometimes it's too bloody dark to even see what's going on! And don't expect to see much of the Three Musketeers here either.
