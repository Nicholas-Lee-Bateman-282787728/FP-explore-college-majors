5089512,4,B007IOVBNG,"First off, you need to know that this is a fairly low budget movie.  There's some CGI and it's not great and the performances turned in by one of the actors is really quite poor.  But all of that said, there performances by the tennagers were great and I really liked the story a lot.  About midway through I was going to turn it off because I thought it was turning into something I really didn't want to see, but I was glad I stuck with it.  Worth a watch!!",1341705600,,459,4.066666666666666
5089513,5,B007IOVBNG,"For an independent film on a budget, shot in Wichita, Kansas no less, it was fascinating. I thought the cinematography was great for this film and well shot. It doesn't have careered actors but I thought they hit the mark and made the story believable. I kept wanting to know what was happening next, really captivating. If you're any kind of military person, or family person, I really think this is a good movie to watch on a Friday night at home, makes for a good evening. Well done.",1340150400,3,486,4.47191011235955
5089514,3,B007IOVBNG,"I really like the plot of the story and felt that it had a lot of potential but, the actors ruined it.  Specifically the actors playing the mom and high school teacher roles.  Their acting seemed a bit stiff and really didn't seem to flow naturally with the story line.  And some of the scenes could have been written and planned out better.  A decent enough movie if you have some time to kill,  But I recommend that you just rent it.",1339372800,4,435,4.2560975609756095
5089515,5,B007IOVBNG,Lee Whitman delivers a fascinating story that rarely goes where you expect it to. It's not hard to understand how shook up a boy would be when he discovers that everything he's been told about his father's army experience was a lie. Trying to find out what actually happened makes for a more harrowing tale than one might imagine. There are clues along the way but they are not particularly obvious. The friendship between the three leads is very believable and well played. This film is well worth viewing.,1339113600,3,507,4.707865168539326
5089516,5,B007IOVBNG,"This was a locally produced and filmed movie here in Wichita, KS. Excellent story and very well produced and told!",1339027200,,114,4.75
5089517,5,B007IOVBNG,This was was a well written and superbly directed production that kept me guessing at the outcome until the very end!!!!,1338595200,,120,4.761904761904762
5089518,4,B007IOVBNG,"For a limited budget, independent kind of film the plot/story line was surprisingly good. It kept me interested throughout the whole movie in wanting to know ""what happens next?""
And, as with limited budget films there are uneven acting performances. Unfortunately, the actress who plays the mother cannot act to save her life. This is unfortunate as it is such a key role in the movie.  Actually, with the exception of the actor who played ""the uncle,"" I thought all the adult performances could have been much better.
I did think the acting from all the young actors playing the teenagers was quite good, especially the actor who plays the son.
There were a few scenes in the movie that didn't really make sense like the huge long table used for the dining scenes where the mother sat at one end and the son the other end. Plus, I really don't think lit candles would be used for regular family dinners - very strange.
All in all I do recommend seeing this film.",1338249600,7,964,4.572254335260116
5089519,4,B007IOVBNG,"War Stories is a surprisingly sophisticated and emotional independent film.  Most of the actors are extremely talented and believable; the score is excellent, and the twist at the end is definitely worth the wait.  Its artistic direction is on par to both hollywood and television.  Definitely worth checking out.",1338076800,,313,5.346938775510204
5089520,5,B007IOVBNG,"This award-winning film is a must-see!!! Director Lee Whitman makes his debut with an emotional thriller, that will have you at the edge of your seat until the very end.

War Stories received rave reviews from film festivals across the country, you won't want to miss it!!",1337817600,,272,4.787234042553192
5089521,4,B007IOVBNG,"This is a fantastic piece of work from a debut director.  Tautly written, inventive, cool shots, and with twists and turns that keep you guessing right up to the very end.",1337731200,,171,4.516129032258065
5089522,3,B007IOVBNG,"For the love of god.  Don't rent this dreadful film.  It's amazing how films like this get made.  Yes, someone had a vision.  Yes, they worked very hard, worked many hours and learned a few things along the way.  While I applaud their effort, it still doesn't mean that it warrants an hour and a half of someone's life to waste.  Rent ""Gigli"" instead.",1372896000,,351,4.40625
5089523,4,B007IOVBNG,"I was impressed by the story line. Very well written.

The actors appear to be learning their craft. There is significant room for improvement in the acting department from almost the entire cast. It looks to me like it is inexperience as actors rather than bad actors however, so I am sure that the cast themselves will get better with more experience.

Do not let the inexperience stop you from watching the movie to the end, however. The plot twists will keep you guessing until the end.",1368835200,3,490,4.620689655172414
5089524,4,B007IOVBNG,A little disappointing in that not much gay activity going on.  A boy tries to find out about his dad who is out of the picture.  I found the relationship between the dad and his boyfriend a much better short story that we find out about at the very end of the video.,1359331200,,267,4.018867924528302
5089525,5,B007IOVBNG,"I don't review I just watch! Although the acting is a bit overdone in spots, I recommend this movie! This is a great story!",1355875200,2,123,4.166666666666667
5089526,2,B007IOVBNG,"WAR STORIES is a film that had great potential... until you hear the dialogue. The dialogue brought this film way down. The best actor would have to be the black guy playing chess. After him, the lead male, and the Uncle. There are a few scenes where you can see the camera in the reflections (close up on eyes/sunglasses). The CGI was pretty good considering the low budget nature. The audio was good except for one small spot about 2 seconds long. The locations were good and lighting was mostly good.

The plot was fairly interesting but the twist ruined it; that scenario is not plausible. This idea should have been split into two films. One about families being torn apart because of homophobia, and another about a government conspiracy over a military veteran (which is what you are lead to believe).

If you are a film student then it is still one I would suggest to see; but on how to improve your own writing. This is a story that I would like to see thought out more, and eventually redone.",1354924800,3,1002,4.5
5089527,5,B007IOVBNG,"I must say after reading some of the reviews about this movie, such as how bad this movie was and the characters were, I almost never watched it. I am so glad I did and I know this movie will and has played out in many homes across America in true life. I believe this is a shame, but true. The characters/actors were not your Big Names of Hollywood and frankly I am glad. This made it more believable. I must say my heart went out for our main character and the twists and turns he had to travel to find out the truth, but he did and the ending is believable also. I do hope you give this Production your time, it is worth it, it was to me.

5089528,4,B007IOVBNG,"17 year old Tim Cartright decides to do his senior history paper on his father's death in the Gulf War, only to find, once he starts doing research, that there is no record of his father (or anyone else from Kansas) dying in that struggle.  Whenever he gets close to finding out what really happened, a new, seemingly insurmountable roadblock is put in his way, and he starts being followed by someone who identified himself as an FBI agent. His mother is also secretive regarding the details of his father's death, and apparently arranged for Tim to no longer have to do the paper, though his curiosity can't let him stop now.

All of this happens during the hectic final months of his senior year in high school, with his girlfriend obsessed with plans for the prom.  As he has since they were little kids, Tim relies heavily on his friend Austin, who has grown into a self-assured young gay man who gets Tim out of some nasty situations. The mystery uncovers his father's notes about UFOs, a war monument that seems to have changed since Tim saw it as a child, and a newspaper story that disappeared from all microfiche and archive copies of that edition.

This is a well-conceived, capably written (and directed) emotional story, extremely ambitious for an indie film with a limited budget.  The one negative is some over-acting by several in the cast (including Michael Gordon as Tim, and Danielle Wolverton as his mother), though Mark Ayesh (as Tim's friend Austin) scores a touchdown with a fully-nuanced, engaging character portrayal. There is a surprise ending I was not at all expecting, which is especially rare in a low budget film like this. Don't miss this one.  Four stars out of five.

DVD extras include only director commentary.  Not rated, would likely be a PG at most.",1350172800,12,1788,4.726688102893891
5089529,1,B007IOVBNG,The best I can offer is that this film would represent a good effort on behalf of a learning director.,1346889600,2,102,4.15
5089530,4,B007IOVBNG,"As a real sci-fi fan, this movie hit all the right marks, and felt a lot like X-files. However, the story is really about relationships - between a boy and his dad,and between him and all the other people who impact his teenage life -- girlfriend, mom, etc. But no relationship stands out as a greater source of strength than the character's great best friend - a non-shit-taking, emancipated minor who takes care of business, and who just happens to be gay.
A lot of care went into the plot of this movie - all the clues make sense - in a Crying Game sort of way.
It gets only four stars because even after being warned how terrible the mother was, I was still unprepared.",1344470400,3,673,4.349206349206349
5089531,3,B007IOVBNG,"some of the worst acting i have ever seen!!! there is not one good actor in this whole thing- trust me not one-
but what a great plot and story-

trust me- there is not one person who can act in the whole movie but is still worth seeing for the plot- elementary school plays have better acting",1341705600,,293,4.051724137931035
8517675,3,B007IOVBNG,It was OK movie,1463616000,,15,3.0
8517676,4,B007IOVBNG,"Well done movie, with an interesting story. It has an ending that might surprise you. All of the actors are well cast, with the exception of the actress that portrays the mother. She is miscast, and her character over acts and is not believable. Thankfully she does not ruin the whole movie. Give the movie a chance.",1443830400,,316,4.56140350877193
8517677,2,B007IOVBNG,"Silly plot, cheaply made, badly acted and horribly filmed. The shot framing, sound and lighting even continuity are all problematic. You can see the ""seams"" in the scenes as the actors visibly turn on and off their characters and emotional faces when delivering their lines. This maybe had potential as a concept but is badly made. I'd give it a pass if I knew it was a student film. I did find myself interested enough to find out what the silliness would lead to so I begrudgingly sat through this thing without fast forwarding, so there's that. There were a few crater sized plot holes that gave me chuckles, so there's that too. The plot starts with an emotionally manipulative story of a boy about to write a thesis on the loss of his father in the 1st gulf war. The plot twists turn silly though perhaps one could find a metaphor in it but I'd be surprised if it was intentional. The plot goes cheesy but the performances so bad it's hard to gauge whether that's due the story or the portrayals. The movie actually is trying to be serious so it's not fun cheesiness. The Sci-Fi tag on this ""movie"" is misleading so you'll be mad if that's why you check this thing out. (** Potential Spoiler - The story does play tricks by baiting an alien abduction element. It played weak and was an emotional distraction. **end spoiler) The lead actor's hair cut is distractingly annoying. I kept waiting for another character to tell him to get his hair off his one eye. All that said, I have to admit there is some glimmer of charisma in this mess. Up-tick to 2 stars for a complete story with a beginning, middle and end and some unexplainable element of charisma. Down-tick to 2 stars for the all around terrible production.",1415836800,,1720,4.516025641025641
8517678,2,B007IOVBNG,"I liked it, but it was listed under gay.  There is nothing gay about this.",1410739200,,74,3.933333333333333
8517679,3,B007IOVBNG,"The story is pretty far-fetched, but there's no question there are parents who would try what the mother pulls off. It's all just a little over-the-top, but with good intentions and the understanding that people want to know where they come from and who they are.",1410652800,,263,4.739130434782608
8517680,4,B007IOVBNG,"Michael Brenton Gordon does a great job of portraying Tim Curtright, a boy searching for the truth about his dad during the Gulf War in 2009's ""War Stories."" Mark Ayesh does a stellar job of playing Tim's ""sidekick"" Austin Davis in much the same way as Tim's uncle was his dad's ""sidekick."" Anyone would be fortunate to have friends like this.

This is a great mystery and drama that is only weakened by the sad performances of Danielle Wolverton as Tim's mom and the actor that plays the high school teacher. The overbearing music in the beginning makes hearing the actor's voices difficult but that clears out fast.

I felt a bit letdown in that I would have liked to see an additional minute or 2 added that shows Tim's life and relationships say,1 year after after high school, that would have been in line with how the movie progressed from Tim's pre-school days.",1404518400,,868,4.62987012987013
8517681,2,B007IOVBNG,"The only reason I purchased this is because my grandson was the young boy in it.  Personally I do not agree with the ""gay"" agenda therefore I didn't like the movie as a whole.  My grandson did a great job on his part though.",1391731200,,224,4.068181818181818
8517682,3,B007IOVBNG,"The story was a good one, but I would agree with other reviewers that the adult acting was, for the most part, very amateurish.  The young acters, especially the lead, were reasonably good.",1387929600,,189,4.7272727272727275
8517683,5,B007IOVBNG,"Despite the low budget, the plot of the movie is worth the watch.  Great movie. Definitely not a waste of time.  Get some popcorn and enjoy the show.",1377648000,,149,4.285714285714286
8517684,3,B007IOVBNG,"Very well intentioned indie film with a nice central performances from the younger cast members. The screenplay wanders a bit and don't look for 100% believable scenes. For example, would a homophobic mom allow her son to have a gay best friend?  But it held my interest and made me want to know how it turned out.",1374883200,2,314,4.508771929824562
