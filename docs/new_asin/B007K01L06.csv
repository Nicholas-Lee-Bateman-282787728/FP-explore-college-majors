5092026,5,B007K01L06,It was packaged well and arrived quickly. No problems at all! My son loves it very much and has asked for more!,1359417600,,111,4.090909090909091
5092027,4,B007K01L06,"I LOVE the Amanda Show.  Even though I was 8 when I started watching this show, I still find it just as funny now as it was then.  I absolutely love Amanda Bynes.  I have almost all of her movies and these Amanda Show season sets Amazon is offering are great to add to my Amanda collection.
There is in fact one problem:
Even though this is called the ""Best of Season 1"", it pretty much features every episode of season 1 except for 4 episodes.  Why these episodes aren't included?  I have no idea.  Season 2 and 3 are complete, but season 1 isn't.  Maybe it's because of copyright issues.  Because of that reason, I took off a star so now it's 4/5 instead of 5/5.  Either way, you still get 9 episodes of Amanda goodness.",1346457600,8,722,4.211678832116788

5092029,4,B007K01L06,"Flashing back big time to the late 90s. After the success of All That Amanda Bynes got her own sketch comedy show. A lot of the great stuff came rushing back as I watched this DVD. Judge Trudy, Dancing Lobsters, Penepole Taint, funny commercials, just so much awesomeness. While I do wish this was the entire season I understand it may be due to music copyrights (since the missing episodes had cameos and musical guests). But look at the glass half-full. Glad to see such a classic 90s Nick Show get a DVD release. Great show, was totally worth it.",1435622400,,549,4.5

5092033,4,B007K01L06,"The Amanda Show has, and always will be, one of THE shows of my preadolescence. The sarcastic humor on the show and skits such as ""When Cheerleaders Attack"" will always be timeless - and I am saying this as a twenty year old man.

However, after purchasing this set on DVD, one thing is quite obvious: the laugh track is almost unbearable. It is nonstop. After a while, my mind must've convinced itself to forget about it and try to enjoy the show. I'm assuming I had a much better toleration and attention span and as a kid.

I still enjoy it and recommend to anyone of any age.",1418774400,,579,4.302752293577981
5092034,5,B007K01L06,"I gave this 5 stars, because every episode is absolutely HILARIOUS, and Idc about Amanda Bynes's reputation, she will always be one of my fave actresses.
Everything about this show is ""Amanda Please""ing!
I highly reccomend this to anybody who loves comedy, Amanda Bynes, and Drake Bell.",1394755200,,286,5.1063829787234045
5092035,5,B007K01L06,"My brother and I used to watch ""The Amanda Show"" on Nickelodeon when we were younger. Classic Nickelodeon never fails to entertain, even if some shows are meant specifically for it's generation. Even though this is an incomplete season set, I'm still satisfied and am not disappointed at all. However, if it is re-released completely, I'll double dip. I also have seasons 2 and 3 as well as the ""Best of the Amanda Show"" single-disc release. This works well because Amazon Prime only has 4 compilations each only containing little amounts of episodes. Well worth the purchase",1391644800,,575,4.938144329896907
5092036,5,B007K01L06,"I agree with all those who have gone before me saying that the Amanda show is great, especially men of legend everywhere. This show is awesome. The sketches with the soup and the general good attitude of everyone involved makes for endless enjoyment. I recommend you stop all that other stuff and just watch this. And watch it again afterwards, you'll want to! Should be marketed as a way to keep kids off drugs since that won't want to do anything but watch this show! Really good, and this dvd has all the best episodes.",1376784000,3,522,4.505263157894737
5092037,5,B007K01L06,"guys the Amanda show is amazing i watched it before. also i watched this dvd and i found it desirable. you should watch it as well, it has all the good ones (i mean they're all the best but still i understand that corporations can't seem to grasp greatness but whatever).

so do it!",1376524800,,282,4.222222222222222
