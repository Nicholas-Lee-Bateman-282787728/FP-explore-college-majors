2812893,5,B000P6R5KC,"The Godannar seriers is a throwback to late afternoon anime cartoon, but with a slightly adult twist. Nothing too risque for viewers above the age of 14 but you would have to see the sheer humor in it. I found it to be an enjoyable series to watch.",1234310400,,248,4.1875
2812894,3,B000P6R5KC,"Perhaps I am just new to the Mecha Anime.  I haven't seen too many of them before.  I just don't much care for a show that has to have charactors that scream the name of the move every single time they use it and unless it includes an abundance of fan service I can't stand the every episode repetition of the same 45 second sequence of the main charactors robot merging with another charactor's.  Got kind of old so I started fast forwarding through them.

If you like these sorts of anime's cool, buy it.  If you are not sure rent this first and see if it's something you are into.",1214179200,3,583,4.216216216216216

VERY FUNNY, highly entertaining, and even emotion gripping (if you get into it like me) tho not too much. BUT, if you don't like that stuff, or Anti-Gravity women parts, then this show isn't for you...",1204070400,,293,4.764705882352941
2812896,5,B000P6R5KC,"This is for the Godannar: Complete Collection.  First off i'm glad that i was able to get this series and in one place as well.  The story basically revolves around Anna and Go, who he saves earlier in the story.  But they get married and even though she's at the young age of 17.  She sometimes does act like a 12 year old still.  But she shows great potential in the piloting one of the giant robots on the base where Go and her mother whom is in charge of the base at the moment.  I don't want to tell the whole story but they are on the verge of getting married when they get an call that a Memetic beast attack is happening.  Its these monsters that they fought a few years ago.  But its back and has started to spread across the planet.  Also introduced early on are 5 other Robot fighter groups and they have a bigger role in the series soon enough.

Just so people know that if they are looking for a kid oriented anime show Godannar..isn't it.  But you can see that from the box cover with the 2 women on front.  There's overt and straight up focus on the females and there (uum huge assets and the jiggling effect) you'll see what i mean and some of the fighter pilots, the Robots and their outfits leave not much to the imagination.  The story progresses over 26 episodes on 5 discs and also goes to the lives of the other people on the base, the mechanics and other folks that work on the robots that Anna, Go, Mira (a person from Go's past) and others.

It's cool that they focus on others instead of just one or two characters and their various struggles with all that is going on around them...beasts attacking, falling in love, first crushes, people from past showing up and relationship issues. All this while fighting breaks out all over the world.  I love anime in general have a great liking towards anime series that focus on Robots and pilots.

Godannar delivers to me on all fronts, voice acting was pretty good, art and the overall direction of the series always seemed to be heading forward even when they were looking back on what had happened so far.

Excellent work...wish it didn't have to end though.",1192752000,14,2130,4.351898734177215

It was a cool anime series, if you are into giant mecha fighting to protect the earth from aliens, which is the typical plot of most of these series. The thing that set it apart from the rest is the soap opera style drama. I'm sure guys will most likely like the fan service part more than anything else, but as they say, 'sex sells.' The character designs were cool and the mecha designs were even cooler. This series obviously had very high production values. So, if you like some serious butt kicking mecha action, fan service and good character development, then Goddannar is for you!",1191110400,7,762,5.8125
2812898,5,B000P6R5KC,"There are already numerous Godannar reviews on amazon.com on for the individual volumes, so I'll just review the DVD release itself.

Like most ADVision thinpack sets, all the extras have been removed, which is unfortunate since Godannar had some nice extras. Mainly, the clean openings and closings, and various pictures and galleries. You don't get the paper inserts either, and the Godannar insert mini-booklets had some nice mini-posters as well as cast interviews.

On the other hand all the packaging is different and kind of interesting for this thinpack release. The box itself is orange overall and contains a terrific picture of Mira, Shizuru, and Godannar on one side (the Mira picture is new) and a picture of Anna on the other side (same picture as the Godannar DVD 7 cover). There are 5 DVDs total, each with 5 episodes except for the last one which has 6 episodes on it. Each DVD thinpack case has an orange cover with a big picture of a robot on it, and each DVD itself has an orange picture with a picture of a girl on it. From first to last, the robot pictures are Godannar (fused), Club Mariner, G-Gunner, Goddiner, and Godannar (blue) with Neo-Okusaer. The girl pictures are Anna, Lou, Shizuru, then surprisingly Luna (pilot of Genesister with yellow hair in pigtails), then finally....Anna's mom?! Yuck oh well. Why not Mira? The Luna picture is new, the rest we've seen before. Kind of weird packaging, but it's for the most part different, and a couple of them are really nice (Mira and Luna).

The DVD menus are also new. They are orange too, and stationary, and ugly. Oh well. The show itself is exactly the same as on the individual volumes. The Season 2 intros in particular remain blurry, which sucks.

Godannar is the best show ever made though and for this price it's a bargain, so I recommend this box set to anyone who hasn't purchased the individual volumes yet. But if you already have the individual volumes, you probably shouldn't bother getting this. In my case, I found a good deal so I bought it just to have an extra copy of Godannar. I paid close to $30 for this boxset, and I paid about $210 to buy all 7 volumes individually (I paid retail price back then, although I got my copies 2-3 weeks before the release dates because of that). This version can also be more convenient to watch if you want more episodes to be on a disc.

Someday I'll have to re-author my own version of Godannar by cutting out the blurry Season Two intros and replacing them with the normal-quality textless Season Two intros found on the original DVDs.",1186099200,7,2571,4.641758241758242
2812899,4,B000P6R5KC,"Godannar get 4 out of five for me. Before my review, his is not a show for kids there is a lot of fanfare a lot. Then there are some rather grizzly transformations.

Now then on to the review. First the good stuff. The best thing about the series is the animation, one word wow. It's smooth, streamline and extremely well done. The voice acting in both dub are also exceptionally well done. The music is about what you'd except for a show like this. The Characters are all likeable and are pretty easy to identify with on a shallow level and nice to look at. The Badies and the Giant Robots were cool looking.

Unfortunately no come the bad parts about the series. One is that all but a few of the characters are extremely shallow and cliche. There is no motives given to the bad guys actions or the good guys beyond evil monster trying destroy world for the heck of it verse good guys trying to save world for the heck of it. However above and beyond all this the biggest problem Godannar has is its lack of depth. Once in awhile it shows a glimmer of it but just doesn't maintain it. The blistering fast pacing of the show attempts to cover for the shallowness and lack of substances and keep you from realizing that you've seen absolutely everything hundreds of times in different stories. Added to this I just couldn't stop myself from really really disliking the main female lead Anna. I didn't quiet hate her but came pretty close. Over all the problems with her character is she's married and is only 17 with the maturity of one thrown into rather complicated situations that are simply beyond her understanding. Sadly this and the shallowness and cliche of everything is prevented the series from getting a better review from me. I would have loved to give it five stars but I would feel to guilty about giving such a shallow series a perfect rating.

Now the all important question. Should you buy this series or not? Yes go a head, it costs less then $40 to buy a box set why not.

Before I go a review of the actual box set itself. The box set is one of ADV's new thin pack packages. Best thing about the box set is the cases are small and don't take up much space. The box for the case is sturdy and well made with nice art work. But that's really all the good things I can say about the box set. Normal I wouldn't recommend getting the box set, like most of the thin box sets. Why you ask? Well for a simple reason is ADV goes threw each disc and removes all of the extra content with the exception of a few trailers on the first disc. This means the textless opening and closings, insert pages even the reversible covers are all gone which sucks big time. If it were a shorter series, I'd say to buy the individual discs. However the box set is less then $40 dollars which is hard to argue with especially since the series isn't worth much more then that.",1186012800,,2869,4.317254174397031
2812900,5,B000P6R5KC,"Since I've already reviewed each individual volume of this series, this review won't go too in depth into the storyline. For a broader more deep review I suggest looking at those reviews.
Anyway this series by far has it all; drama, comedy, action, sci-fi and believe it or not its kinda like a soap opera only more grown up and fun. Now to say I didn't notice the fan service would be a lie. This series has a lot. Sadly the cover of this complete collection really only shows that aspect. Fan service there may be, but fan service this series is not about. This series has a ton of heart with great characters, cool mecha and a storyline that will surprise you at how engrossing it becomes. The animation is top notch and the voice acting is superb. Honestly I think the English voice acting is better and allows you to fully take in the awesome visuals. Ladies, don't think this is just a guys series because of the voluptuous women and the giant robots. The guys aren't bad looking either and it may be shown far less than the women but the fan service is there for you too. Also these are some of the toughest smartest chicks Ive seen in anime, not just pretty faces with amazing bodies. My wife who hates mecha, I repeat HATES mecha, loves this show for the all the things Ive mentioned above.
This collection has both seasons in it for a total of 26 episodes and for $70 retail, and Ive seen it for cheaper at around $55 dollars in stores and at the time of this review about $35 here on Amazon, you are getting an amazing buy. Of course being a thinpack this collection has been stripped of the awesome and numerous extras from the individual volumes, but for half the price of retail and in most places cheaper than that, this is a steal!",1185580800,23,1747,4.361963190184049

2812954,4,B000P6R5KC,"Mech Robot series that are good are a dime a dozen, Godannar falls in to that category, which is good but it left you feeling somewhat unfulfilled. Story wise without spoiling much, in the future, Wolrd is at war with monsters that appeared from the depths to destroy everything, Mech robots are created to combat the plague that engulf them. Each country had one super robot to fight and defend their area. Godannar is from Japan and it's one of the strongest robots from the bunch, US, Russia, UK, and China also had super robots. Theme wise is always, united we stand and divided we fall. Each episode contains lots of action, sexy scantly clad women in outrageous outfits, lots of shouting, and comedy, and story progression that culminate in number 26, which is the last one. Personally, I like it, but it's not for everyone. If you love robots, then give Godannar a try...",1411862400,,878,4.670967741935484

I watched this many years ago, and enjoyed it.  The story is not original, but they throw in a lot of unusual plot points.  I good old series for those who remember the old school anime.",1377993600,2,1064,4.263681592039801

2812959,5,B000P6R5KC,"I love this series and have watched it multiple times alone and with friends and I've never had a bad experience! The characters are great, the robots are made of 100% pure metal awesome, the plot twists are timed and placed perfectly, and the humor is funny everytime. No matter how many times you watch it.

There is the good news now onto the small bit of bad, if you're thinking about getting this series then I truly recommend getting the individual volumes instead of the box set. Each volume comes with a giant smorgasbord of extras such as robot and enemy files, character bios and more! The box set however only has the episodes and if you are like me you like all those little extras!

But if you're tight on cash then get the box set. Either way it's a great series that I'll never stop recommending!",1296259200,,811,4.436241610738255
2812960,2,B000P6R5KC,"I know tastes differ, but I'm having a hard time understanding the high praise others have given this series.  Based on those positive reviews, I purchased the set, but am so very dissappointed.  With almost no real plot or character development, every episode seems to have only one purpose -- fanservice for adolescent boys into really large breasts.  The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one is because, bad as this series is, there are worse out there, and I wanted to distinquish between bad and really bad.

Its not a new idea for an anime.  They have been making this type of show for more than 20 years, and Godannar is not a new show.

But it has a lot of humor and occasionally even manages to push the characters enough that they almost escape the tropes they were built from.

But its also not much more than what you'd expect from the genre.  So I can say that lovers of the genre will love it.  Others will likely grow bored.",1508889600,,505,4.208333333333333
8189646,3,B000P6R5KC,"Bright colors, direct dialogs, dramatic turns, from the very fist, it's obvious that they're going all out for this one. It's a melodrama first, a mecha anime second. The shouting got a little annoying, as it seems every other word is belted out. Anger, sadness, surprise, challenges, not a single opportunity is missed. I like the second season over the first, mostly because it looks at pilots from other countries a bit more, and even the mechanics get the spotlight. It's got fanservice, complete with tight outfits over man a woman parts. I never really understood the point of the rogue mecha pilot. It just felt like a contrived conflict - weren't all the robots known? Government sponsored? And weren't all the pilots known to each other? And the pacing is unrelenting, fight monsters, fight mecha, personal issues, more monsters - geeze! I rather like that this feels like a classic mecha anime that's been updated, but such a major plot hole is too much, especially when coupled with all the shouting and unrelenting melodrama. An anime with good Japanese voice acting, fun designs, solid production, but one that couldn't make me really care about the characters. Ends up a 3 because I'd have to talk myself into watching it again.",1485561600,,1242,4.890995260663507
8189647,5,B000P6R5KC,"- Synopsis: This anime showcases human-kind struggling for survival against mysterious parasitic beasts. The only way for them to combat these monsters is to use giant robots and maintain relationships for positive combat results. Because synergy between pilot and partner is essential to combat effectiveness. Join these unique cast of characters as they set off to defend humanity from monster threats in giant robots.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime has plenty of fan-service, so if that isn't your thing, best to avoid it. There's some nudity, which is fortunately uncensored. Mainly some scenes of boobs and such.

- Analysis: Relationships tend to keep other people going. If not for the power of bonds, life would be even more harsh. This is relevant as many people that struggle through life probably have friends or family members that they can rely on. Those that don't, probably are more likely to give up. In other words, life heavily revolves around the socialization and relationships of others. Especially with like-minded individuals.

- Features: Japanese and English audio, as well as English subtitles. This is an older anime, as well as a DVD format, so it won't have anything to brag about when it comes to visuals. Includes 26 episodes on 5 discs that run about 10.5 hours in total. Rated TV-MA mainly for violence and sexual content.

- Conclusion: The story is simple. It's basically relationships forged from fighting alien-like creatures with their mechas. Reminds me of a mature version of Power Rangers. If you like an old-school feel, as well as hot girls, and robots fighting against monsters, this is a great anime to enjoy.
