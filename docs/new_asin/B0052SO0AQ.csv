8454173,2,B0052SO0AQ,"As I sit here, in the Bay Area, watching this drivel for the first time, I wonder:  what's worse?  Watching this movie, or enduring the actual earthquake itself?  How 'bout we flip for it?

The writing is cliche, the acting is weak, the direction is directionless, and the music is manipulative.  Other than that, it's pretty good!  Oh, that's right; there's not much left.

But the digital transfer is pretty good, even though it's in its original 4 x 3 non-widescreen.  And it was ""free,"" although I pay a lot every month for DirecTV so ultimately, I paid for it indirectly.

I wonder if all the other reviewers, who gave this ""film"" a 5, were directly involved?  I don't feel much objectivity there.  But if you want to watch a movie that involves the Oakland A's that doesn't suck, check out ""Moneyball.""  That'll really rock your world, unlike this disaster of a film.",1407196800,,873,4.633986928104576

8454175,5,B0052SO0AQ,"This movie is well done, it's a part of my history as I lived through this quake. Had it not been for the World Series, my father would have been working under I-880 right where it collapsed. This movie does the incident justice. Also as a side note for anyone wondering why those of us in the bay fear the Giants and the A's going to the world series together, this quake is why! ;)",1378771200,2,383,4.12
