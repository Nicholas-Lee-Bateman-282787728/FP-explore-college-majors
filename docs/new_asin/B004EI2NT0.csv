8426951,5,B004EI2NT0,"This is a prime example of everything an indie film can be. Wonderfully nuanced performances, insightful and clever writing, beautiful cinematography and the pure vision of a spectacular director! Definitely worth purchasing, watching, getting this however you can. Especially if you are a cinephile, super film fan, filmmaker or aspiring filmmaker! Also, if you are an actor, you will be jealous you missed being a part of this...",1470182400,,431,5.352941176470588

8426953,4,B004EI2NT0,"Unmade Beds introduces us to three young people apparently getting by living in a cluttered squat in England, dabbling in several of the arts. An initial reaction is that these are ugly slackers aimlessly going about in an unattractive existence. As we get to know these people begin to understand that they are loyal to each other, attempting to understand themselves and sympathetic to the audience. This may be a generational movie with the younger crowd able to instantly understand these people. Director Alexis DOS Santos is able to make his characters appealing even to an older less tolerant generation. The artistry in this movie derives from the deft movie making that can seduce you into rooting for these people.

Axl arrives in England from Spain, seeking the father who abandoned his mother and his much younger self. He joins in with Mike and Hannah who either live in or run a semi-abandoned building where people can live rent free. It is never clear that any inhabitant of this building has any legal right to be there but it is home to 20 somethings who apparently come and go at will. Mike and Hannah provide for Axl something in the way of adult supervision and advice as well as a way to make money as a fellow artist - nightclub employee.

The practical side of their communal life is relatively unimportant except that it functions. The more important aspect of this movie are the various ways the three central characters fumble their way into a more adult understanding of themselves and life.
Axl is perhaps the most interesting character. Early on it is clear that he is a heavy drinker but once drunk experiences total memory loss. Given his age the tendency is to write him off as a late stage alcoholic. This will prove to be a misjudgment. He will find his missing father but the outcome of their meeting is not obvious or hackneyed.

Mike and Hannah will find love and bungle it. Young love maybe an invitation to play games but too many games is not the way to prove the strength of love.

I am not current enough on the different music styles to correctly identify the soundtrack to Unmade Beds. It is not a style that I generally like but I'm not sure that any other style would have been appropriate to this movie. I will not be buying the soundtrack. But this is the soundtrack that belongs to this movie. Even in the music my initial reaction was to reject it and in the end to appreciate it.

This movie is not appropriate for the very young both in terms of sexual content and complex plotting. For the same reasons I cannot suggest it for a casual afternoon's relaxation. For the right couple this could be a date night movie but I don't think I would spring it on someone without some sense that they might ""get it"". Alexis DOS Santos has made a clever movie that expects you to have patience and a humanist spirit. I can see fans of this movie wanting to watch it many times both for the experience and to pick out things they may have missed in the earlier showings. I can also see a lot of people refusing to give it this movie a chance. I will want time between viewings but I do want it on my shelf.",1413158400,,3147,4.494755244755245

8426955,4,B004EI2NT0,"This film confirms yet again what I have always believed, youth, although great in its own right, is over-rated.  Like the previous reviewer J., I did not really like it at first.  The aimless characters bugged me.  However, I realized that young people, that's what they do, search.  Searcing for identity, love, romance, direction, friendship, anything and everything that is worth searching for.  I did the same when I was their age, only not in bars and faceless encounters.

The music, was also interesting.  Did not like it at first but got sucked into the witty lyrics.

The actor who played Axl reminds me of Elijah Wood in Lord of The Rings trilogy, the same cherubic face and mop of curl hair.  The french actress who played Vera is not a traditional beauty but the more I see her face the prettier she seemed.

If you stick to it to the end, you may love the ending like I did.  It gives hope, big hope for the major characters in the film, Axl, Vera, Mike, and the airport X-ray guy. :-)",1358726400,,999,4.464088397790055

8426957,4,B004EI2NT0,"I hated Unmade Beds at first because I did not recognize it. I have revised this review so many times already that I hope Amazon will allow just one more. I think I can get it right at last.

At first, this seemed like a bleak and depressing picture of young people: of random, meaningless sex, total aimlessness in life, and grating, obnoxious music. They seemed more old and worn-out than young, more dead than alive, and it made me very sad.

But then suddenly I saw that they are exactly like me when I was their age, and if this movie had been made in the East Village of New York City in 1967 instead of London more than 40 years later, I could easily have been in it; and not one word, not one scene, not the tiniest detail would have to change. This is EXACTLY what life was like then.

The life it shows looks bleak and pointless to older generations (that's me now), but under the surface it is a life of unbelievable, matchless discovery and productivity. At the time I seemed just as lost as the kids in this movie do, but I look back on the late 1960s as the most glorious time in the history of the world, a time of unprecedented beauty, change and innovation. I trust that the generation depicted so accurately in Unmade Beds will feel the same about their own youth 40 years from now.

I especially recommend this movie to old farts like me who hate it at first: that may be because it hits closer to home than you expected it to. Let it get under your skin and see what happens.",1297382400,13,1495,4.235087719298246
8426958,5,B004EI2NT0,"As an avid fan of Sundance and IFC Channels, I caught this movie recently and fell in love! Anyone who enjoys indie film needs to watch this movie ASAP. The charaters are real and lovable and searching. The dialogue is poetic and thought-provoking, and the plot is full of fascinating motifs, like the idea of falling in love in your sleep and waking up confused. Watch this movie for the killer tunes if for no other reason, I was rocking out the whole time! (Check out: ""We are Not the Same"" by Good Shoes and ""Hot Monkey, Hot Ass!"" by Black Moustache and you'll see what I mean.)

Although Vera has an interesting storyline of her own, I immediately fell in love with Axl, who has an adorable mop of wild, dark hair and spends his nights getting wasted in a bar (called ""Lost and Found"") and listening to live music. The party scenes are great and almost remind me of the British drama Skins.

Go watch it!",1296000000,7,909,4.404761904761905
