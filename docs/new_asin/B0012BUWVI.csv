I bought 4 others in this series and the 2nd one was a little longer and had various enemy newsreels including Japanese footage . . I can't help but wonder if there might have been a problem when they made these DVD's and possibly only one short film was recorded by accident. If these are actually produced and sold by the National Archives , they are making a nice profit on them since there are no royalties involved.
Don't think I'd trust buying any more of them unless they list how many clips there are and how long the running time is.",1202169600,2,624,4.2521008403361344
8244986,1,B0012BUWVI,"I wasn't sure what to expect. The quality of transfer is great....very clean & clear.
The footage is mostly scenes that you've probably viewed before....But the big downer is the length of this DVD. Although I didn't take a stop watch to it, it's only about 10-12 minutes long! I couldn't believe my eyes. If the rest of the series is like this, I would stay far away.",1201996800,3,368,4.426470588235294
