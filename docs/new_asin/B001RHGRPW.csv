3776113,5,B001RHGRPW,"I saw John Wayne from the time I was very young and went to the Lincoln Theatre in Detroit< Michigan where I was born.  He was just starting and was in the Western pictures with a doubed in singer, I think he was Singing Sam or something like that.  I followed him down the line in his movies, but when The Quiet Man came on the screen, he became my all time favorite.  he is without a doubt a good Republican, and so am I.  Love his movies and copied them all when i could on TCM or Fox when they had them, purchased most, however over time.  I saw the island that he lived on when in CA in 1977 and went to visit the American legion fPost at Newport Beach, CA.  They told us he lives on the island and was not well, the boats would go by and whistle at him.  I wished I had of met him, as I lived in Long Beach in 1952 and then in Tempe, AZ in 1960 and came thru Stanfield where he kept his cattle and had a ranch.  Have pictures of his Newport Beach home and also up in AZ.

I did not expect much in the line of quality when you get 20+ movies for eight bucks, but the video quality failed to meet even my lowest expectations. To fit some 25 movies on 4 DVD discs they compressed the video to such an extent that the movies are painful to watch. The video is very fuzzy and completely lacking in detail, even movies like McClintock (made in 1963 when film image quality was already very good and far better than the image quality on these discs.) The sound track quality resembles the quality of very poor MP3 tracks.

Since this is the only source I am aware of, for Wayne's early 1930's movies, I will keep the set despite its poor quality. If anyone is aware of a source for better quality old-time movies, please post it here. Collectors like top quality. The fact that the movies are antiques, does not justify reproducing them in junk quality!

While I would expect the 1930's movies to be substandard, even some of them were better quality than Mclintock, which should have been at least low level tv quality.

It was so bad, that Im not only going back to where I bought to get my $$ back, and if that fail on that I will do what I can to make sure the biz which is Crackerbarrel, to lose other business.

Anybody who considers this a worthy collection needs to grow up and maybe re-record their particular one off tv or similar.

Even my own 'recording' of McClintock, is of better quality than this.

For me its not even worth 1/5 of what I paid.
If I had gotten this free, it would be in the trash now.

Not a single movie in this collection set (4 dvd's) is worth it in any fashion.

Fortunately for me, most of the pre-1940's John Wayne is not truley worth it anyway in terms of
trying to replace this cd with a properly made versions.
Only two movies were even worth that effort (and I have personal copies (off cable tv).
I have a fair amt of the early movies on vhs anyway, it would have been cool to replace them with this dvd... but never with something so substandard in quality or even production value of the copies they made.

Whether one is a John Wayne collector or not, having this particular set is a joke and

3776223,1,B001RHGRPW,"This collection of John Wayne movies are not good quality. Takes you back to the silent movies where the horses don't look like they are moving naturally .The voices don't sound right either. Bit of a disappointment,too old. Must be the very first movies he made as a young actor in black and white. Not good enough to keep watching,lost interest fast.",1279497600,19,352,4.693548387096774
3776224,3,B001RHGRPW,"This was in fact a bundle of John Wayne DVDs, but what I didn't know was all the movies included were his million year old films that no one has heard of, not his more recent more popular films. I haven't been able to sit through a whole one yet.",1278201600,2,246,3.94
3776225,4,B001RHGRPW,Takes you back to know John Wayne and how he rose to be an Icon.  Simple basic movies when actors did acting and not enhanced by computers.  His walk and manner is developed.  Could be a serial and many same actors in each movie just a different plot.  Enjoyable for those of B/W movies of the 39's ....WG,1277510400,3,305,4.206896551724138
3776226,5,B001RHGRPW,"After checking out these 25 films in Videohound, I found that there are some gems here. Most are watchable and entertaining, but to make it easier for the potential viewer to understand, these are definitely watchable: Blue Steel, Riders of Destiny, Sagebrush Trail, Winds of the Wasteland, West of the Divide, Angel and the Badman, and McLintock. Adding the cost of shipping and handling for these alone (if you can find them), is $21. This is a keeper.",1272153600,72,454,4.833333333333333

3776229,4,B001RHGRPW,"The information provided above concerning the types of programs included in this collection has a couple of errors.  This does not collect two previously released John Wayne sets; rather, it expands the 20 film set with different versions of some titles.

There are not three complete serials in the set.  SHADOW OF THE EAGLE does contain all 12 chapters; however, THE HURRICANE EXPRESS is in the edited, feature length form (80 mins.) even though the opening credits list ""12 Chapters.""  THE THREE MUSKETEERS is also in edited form under the re-release title DESERT COMMAND (71 mins.).  For those that are curious, MCLINTOCK is taken from a pan & scan source.

What's also missing in the above information is that Disc 3 contains 80 minutes of trailers (32 in all).  It should also be pointed out that Mill Creek has packaged the DVDs in little envelopes that sit inside the plastic case.  This might be easier for some people to flip to the disc they want, and I'm sure it brings the cost down for materials.

For the price this is still a good collection to get, but anyone looking for the complete serials would have been disappointed.",1245628800,236,1139,4.741116751269035

There's 20 films here as well as three complete 12 episode serials. The 18 programmers and one of the features are westerns; the serials aren't. In all these, Duke portrays a pilot. An additional bonus TV documentary, ""The American West Of John Ford,""  is hosted by Wayne (and others).

This excellent package is a must-have for all fans of Duke.
