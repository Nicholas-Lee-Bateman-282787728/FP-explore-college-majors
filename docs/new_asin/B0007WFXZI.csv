2246527,5,B0007WFXZI,"This is a splendid performance of Candide. But before you go any further, you should realise that this is a concert performance, not a full scale operatic staging of the work. That said, the singing is glorious and the acting, despite this being a concert performance is outstanding. It is driven to milk all the comic elements out of the play. It all works delightfully. It is so brimful of joie de vivre, it leaves you smiling and humming all day. I must disagree with a previous reviewer who said, Bernstein wouldn't be amused. This is precisely what he would have wanted to achieve.

Sir Thomas Allen is superb as Dr. Pangloss who doubles as the narrator of the concert. Paul Groves and Patti LuPone are both excellent. But the star of this Candide is surely the lovely Kristin Chenoweth as Cunegonde, who in addition to having a magnificient voice shows that she is a natural comedienne and actress. This recording of Candide immediately goes to the top of the list. Now, if only we could have Bernstein's own production of Candide recorded live at the Barbican Theatre in London. That recording under the Deutsche Grammophon label is yet to appear on DVD.

I should comment on the camerawork which received criticism from a previous reviewer. It is a mark of the electric quality of this bravura performance that most viewers don't even notice the occasionally almost amateurish shakiness of the camera. The cameraman was shaky at times and faces occasionally went in and out of focus but a large part of what I initially attributed to poor camerawork was in fact artificially introduced motion artifacts. This is a problem with the DVD encoding and not the camera. These cause apparent jumps in the picture. But this is present only in DVD players with low end video processors. Switching to a better DVD player or processor solves the problem.

The DVD by Image Entertainment is in 1.78:1 widescreen (anamorphic enhancement). Picture quality is very good, clear, sharp and with rich natural colors. The picture is flawless provided you play it on a good DVD player. It comes with 3 audio tracks, DTS 5.1, Dolby Surround 5.1 and Dolby Stereo. Excellent immersive sound. It would have been good if they had included an uncompressed PCM track as well but I suppose that's asking a bit much. All in all, an outstanding concert and one to be forever treasured.

Technical note: As noted above I noticed a strange problem with this particular DVD. It seems to play quite flawlessly on certain systems, yet throw up irritating problems on others. On one set-up I noticed numerous motion artifacts and lots of combing issues. Motion appears jerky and horizontal scan lines appear whenever fast movements occur or rapid scene changes take place. I'm not quite sure why they should be there but I attibute it to faulty encoding or improper flagging. No other DVD exhibits these errors on this particular system. I believe what one of the previous reviewers complained about could be due to this. The problem goes away when switching to an alternate system with a better deinterlacer / video processor. However that does not absolve Image Entertainment from responsibility for producing a sub-standard DVD which requires high end equipment to compensate for its deficiencies.

P.S. Bernstein's Candide can be interpreted in many ways. Some approach it as serious opera, others as light operetta, still others as a Broadway musical or even farce. Liking or disliking a particular production is very subjective. If you adhere to Bernstein's final vision of this work, enshrined in his by now legendary Barbican performance (Final, revised edition, first premiered 1988 by Scottish Opera and later performed with the LSO at the Barbican in 1989 with high powered opera stars singing all the roles), then you will tend to view this more as Opera and consequently your attitude to any performance that detracts from that operatic image (like this one) will be very negative. But you must remember that for many years, and for most Americans, Candide was considered a Broadway musical and at most a comic operetta. The two contrasting visions are equally valid and are a testament to Bernstein's genius and Candide's status as a true masterpiece.",1116979200,135,4237,4.945224719101123
2246528,2,B0007WFXZI,"Unfortunately the new DVD of ""Candide"" is the worst production I've ever seen. (I've seen five, in Los Angeles and New York.)  Kristin Chenoweth is the only bright spot and is a perfect Cunegonde, possibly the best since Barbara Cook originated the role.  The woman can do no wrong. But the director, Lonny Price, should never be allowed to direct again.  Over all, most of the other performances are ultra-hammy - Patti LuPone as the Old Lady - or miscast - the actor who plays Maximilian looks like a geek (the director had the ""bright"" idea to cast someone unattractive on the grounds that his excessive self-love would be somehow humorous. Hah-hah).  The production is also filled with topical updates that wouldn't be funny in a TV sitcom, including one that refers to Donald Trump in ""The Apprentice.""  In short, the production is frenetic -- it certainly moves along -- but is unabashedly devoid of any taste.  But at least, it has the music and Ms Chenoweth, a role she was born to play.  (I sincerely hope she plays it again, but in a full production and with a competent director.) Other than that, I think Leonard Bernstein would not be amused.",1116547200,15,1155,4.688118811881188
2246529,5,B0007WFXZI,"I have been listening to Candide recordings since seeing the original in the 50's  The Cunangonda role has belonged to Barbara Cook until now and she is at least tied by Kristen Chenoweth, who is unbelievable in this performance.  So are Paul Groves, Patti LuPone and all the others.  Sir Thomas Allen does a wonderful job as Dr. Pangloss and the Narrator.

So, perfect singing with a particularly stunning performance by Ms. Chenoweth (look out Ms. Cook and Ms. Masterson).  Let's not forget conductor Marin Alsop who has been a favorite of mine for years.

I don't know what the person who said the DVD was bad was talking about.  I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to all as a must-have.

2246530,4,B0007WFXZI,"As mentioned in other reviews, this production is fabulous! Even if you recorded it when it aired on PBS stations, consider buying the DVD. (no pledge breaks, no cuts!) Also, the DVD has DTS 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 surround audio tracks. With surround on, you feel you are sitting in the audience! The reason I gave it 4 stars, rather than 5-- one disappointment. There is no captioning option. Not even the closed-captions from the broadcast. Having the ""libretto"" displayed, made it more enjoyable.",1116374400,8,494,4.892857142857143
2246531,4,B0007WFXZI,"I have to say that though I would immediately give this five stars just on the production itself, the quality of the DVD sucks. The sound is great...but the camera work is shaky, blurry...the I can't tell if they are moving the camera or trying to pan and scan (though it is in letterbox) but there are times when the digital recording just doesn't mesh with what the camera is doing. Glitter and be Gay is hard to watch because of this. I don't remember it being like this on PBS. But I guess since this is the only version of it on DVD...and the performances by orchestra, stars, chorus and director are all top notch - then by all means get it. Just take a Dramamine before you watch it.",1116374400,3,690,4.2748091603053435
2246532,5,B0007WFXZI,I was very fortunate to be in the choir for this concert.  That being said about 15 to 20 minutes of the performance were cut when it was aired on PBS.  I'm looking forward to owning my own copy.,1115856000,6,195,3.9743589743589745
2246533,5,B0007WFXZI,"I was lucky enough to be in the audience the night this performance was taped for broadcast. The terms ""You had to be there"" can't express the enjoyment of the evening. The entire cast led by the phenominal Kristen Chenoweth was what one might call the ""DREAM CAST"".Backed by the New York Philharmonic, the world's most loved orchestras in the worlds favorite city (New York), Who said you need lavish sets to make this a fun show. One remembers the the music and the performances of the singers and the musicians. I NEVER heard anyone walk out of a concert hall humming the scenery. I wish I could give more than 5 stars, because the stage was full of them that night. To be able to own a DVD of this evening, will enable all those in that SOLD OUT performance to relive that night time and time again.

2246535,5,B0007WFXZI,"If you missed this performance on PBS, be sure to snag a copy of this DVD. This is a brisk, snappy, offbeat, and joyous version of a production that is notoriously difficult to pull off. Kristen Chenoweth's performance (in the role of Cunegonde) alone makes this a must-have. Brilliant!",1110585600,28,286,4.857142857142857
2246536,3,B0007WFXZI,"A good performance, partly staged.  The concert performance conducted by Bernstein is superior.  Why certain scenes were cut is unclear.

From the start it sparkles with wit , the cast are completely at home with both lyrics and music, whilst every movement and gesture are delightfully choreographed . Marin Alsop, who since 2004 has done many remarkable things, including conducting  on two final nights at the London Promenade Concerts, has rehearsed the New York Philharmonic superbly in one of her favourite composers..A triumph.",1442707200,,542,5.352941176470588
2246542,5,B0007WFXZI,"I imagined that I would never need another DVD of this superb piece from Leonard Bernstein, having loved his own version, committed to disc not long before his death. But this one, seen on PBS some years ago, is its equal in many ways, and in some respects goes beyond what the composer himself was able to produce. Chenoweth is wonderful, hilarious, perhaps occasionally squally in the stratosphere of ""Glitter and be Gay,"" but quite superb in comedy. Sir Thomas Allen is magnificent as narrator and as Pangloss, his spectacular baritone, both sung and spoken, with equally stalwart diction, holding the sprawling whole together wonderfully. The tenor Candide is terrific as well, his blocky body containing a voice both sweet and affecting and powerful as the score demands. The production is staged in and out of an on-stage orchestra, and it nearly always is effective, with only an occasional awkwardness in the youthful chorus. My only serious disappointment is Patty LuPone's old lady. She is very funny, as I expected, but generally incomprehensible with an affected accent laid on with a trowel. Still, the production is a delight. I love this piece, and would now not part with either version. I would especially hate to lose Jerry Hadley's very touching Candide, made the more so by his recent suicide, a shocking loss to those who love great singing. I suggest you buy this DVD today.",1440720000,8,1396,4.94468085106383

2246545,5,B0007WFXZI,"This semi staged version of Candide, is lean, funny and moves quickly.  Every aspect of the production is fun and beautifully conceived.  The New York Philharmonic gives the score power that would not be possible in a fully staged version and the typical theater orchestra.  Using actors with Broadway experience gives the piece a theatrical momentum that would not likely be present with performers coming from a classical background.  Kristin Chenoweth, Patti LuPone and all of the others are wonderful.  The Chorus even gets into the act.  The audio is clear; the video is crisp.  The video direction does not detract from the action.",1425168000,,637,5.0673076923076925
2246546,5,B0007WFXZI,"""Candide"" is a problematic work that failed at birth.  The original culprit was Lillian Hellman's plodding book juxtapositioned with Berstein's sparkling score.  People have been trying to solve it's creative riddle ever since the 1960's.  This is certainly the most satisfying version of ""Candide"" we are ever likely to have.  It is glorious! Thank the gods it has been preserved for future generations! I've seen many productions of ""Candide"" and own most of the recordings.  This is by far the best of all possible worlds, indeed! Barbara Cook's original rendition of ""Glitter and Be Gay"" has been the standard for decades much the way Ethel Merman's version of ""Roses Turn"" from ""Gypsy"" was.  For decades now I have seen a parade of female performers try and match, better or duplicate the renditions of the original performers associated with these parts.  All (in my book) have failed.  Until now...I had the pleasure of seeing Patti LuPone match Merman's Rose on stage...I now have Kristin Chenoweth forever on DVD matching Cook's fireworks.  Both are very different in their way, but just as impressive and powerful.  BUY THIS DVD!",1424822400,6,1139,5.075268817204301

2246558,5,B0007WFXZI,"'Leonard Bernstein's' Candide is a great achievement by him.  The music for the show was written by him and produced AFTER the miraculously great show 'West Side Story.'  It never had the success of the earlier show.  But just think of a song like 'We'll Build a Garden' that ends the show (with its obvious musical references to the end of Stravinsky's 'Firebird.'  It is such a touching and brilliant song....  But that is only one of the great treasures of the show.  Of course the thematics of the show weave around Voltaire's classic. And establish the Enlightenment context of the show.  But I for one would not quibble with this.  It is a monumental achievement; and performed on the highest possible level in this non-staged but dramatic version we have here.

But the question I always ask myself about the show is---Why is it not called 'Leonard Bernstein's and Stephen Sondheim's 'Candide''?  For THEY were the principle collaborators in producing its great songs.....  And now we know how great Sondheim is both as a lyricist (as he was for 'Candide'; and as a musical composer---cf. Passion, Sunday in the Park with George, Company, Into the Woods, etc.  In the future it might be proper to recall this when 'Candide' is written about or promoted.",1408752000,4,1260,4.809302325581395

2246573,5,B0007WFXZI,"Candide was the first musical I discovered on my own back when I was in junior high.  It was also my first exposure to a Broadway musical via record album - instead of the standard venue of the movie adaptation.  (When you don't live in New York and you are a young kid it is hard to go to Broadway plays!)

I loved listening to the album. I loved reading the play.  I loved reading the translation of the original story. But I had never _seen_ the play. Until now.

This special made-for-video production is a ""concert musical."" Which is to say that this is not a stage play, complete with sets and costumes and dialog.  Mostly its just the songs, sung by fine Broadway actors like Kristin Chenoweth, Thomas Allen, and even Patti LuPone!

But it is almost a disservice to call this a mere concert performance.  The band here is the New York Philharmonic, composer Leonard Bernstein's alma mater. The actors move in and around the orchestra, wear elaborate costumes, and even drag the conductor into their play (it is great to see the conductor singing along with these catchy songs as she waves her baton). The choir even participates in the action and costuming. Elided dialogue is summarized by narrators who remain in-character.  Fantastic.

And the songs and music are great.  The source is the updated book and songs (I think from 1973?). Chenoweth is a worthy successor to ""my"" Cunnegunde, Barbara Cooke.

Also, this is very much an ""operetta"" version of production.  Lots of laughs and lots of sparkling music.  No hint of the Wagnerian productions from some of the later recorded versions of the play.

Loved it. You will too.",1333670400,2,1635,4.687719298245614

I loved the characters in this show. I especially enjoyed Cunegonde played by the beautiful Kristin Chenoweth. Her comic timing both during dialogue and during her operatic masterpiece ""Glitter And Be Gay"" is just priceless. She has a singing voice that is just perfection. A Song has no better friend than Kristin Chenoweth! The chemistry on stage that she has with Paul Groves (Candide) and Patti LuPone ""The Old Lady"" is so wonderfully apparent. Groves and LuPone show their tallent off as well. The cast really gives a top notch performance. I'll admit I am a big Kristin Chenoweth fan. Watching Kristin alone is watching a superb tallent, I purchased this DVD because of her. I do think, however, the cast as a whole does a kind of a show that shows opera in a more entertaining program. It is a visual delight!

The quality of the singing is quite acceptable; however, the setting with lots of running around through the orchestra (on stage) is at first amusing, then seems amateurish, and finally becomes tiresome and distracting from the singing and music.  The production might have entertained the audience during its public performance, but has not transferred well for repeated viewing.  I saw a properly staged production in Sydney, Australia during the early 80s -- and it was both excellent and memorable.

2246585,5,B0007WFXZI,"This is the only performance of Candide I've seen. I viewed it on Public Television years ago. I finally decided to buy it.
  I thought West Side Story was o.k. and that Fiddler on The Roof was good, if that will give you some idea of my taste in music. I do like very serious stuff like Beethoven,Brahms and so forth. I listen to Bluegrass,Country and Jazz also.
  However, if you just want to set back and enjoy something really funny with good infectious music and wonderful performers, then this is it.
  This performance is played for laughs and I think it is hilarious. The music is great with the opening overture being my favorite.
  Kristin Chenoweth steals the show with her outstanding performance and Paul Groves provides us with a great Candide. The rest of the cast gives excellent performances also. These include Patti LuPone, Stanford Olsen and Sir Thomas Allen. There are no bad performances here at all from anyone.
  This is staged as a stage show and not as a full opera, meaning that the orchestra, choir, conductor and characters are all on the same stage. For me that seemed unusual (that's a lot stuff on one stage!), but didn't detract from the enjoyment of it.
  The conductor, Marin Alsop did a fine job of keeping it all together, with everything that was happening on the stage. She was in the middle of it all.
  All I can say is that I watched this by myself and found myself laughing out loud. Now that's funny!

A DVD of a musical written by one of the best musical theater composers (or composers, period, for that matter) with the music performed by one of the best orchestras in the world (the full-size New York Philharmonic, rather than what today would be the inevitable 12-person pit orchestra) with the revised and much truer-to-Voltaire book and starring at least two of the best all-around musical theater performers working today. As the DVD itself indicates, typically finding a Cunegonde who can hit all of the low and high notes usually means finding a humorless opera singer who isn't at all believable as a love interest. Thank you Kristen Chenoweth for being one of the exceptions to the rule. And thank you Leonard Bernstein, Lillian Hellman, Tyrone Guthrie, Harold Prince, Barbara Cook, Stephen Sondheim, Hugh Wheeler, and all the others who have brought 'Candide' to this current, excellent form.",1264636800,4,915,5.147651006711409

Sound is garbled in places, cameras are focused on areas where nothing is happening, and empty spots on the stage are hit with spotlights that then are yanked away.  The formidable cast are each in fine voice, but their voices don't sound fine when they sing together,  It's the aural equivalent of wearing stripes and plaids at the same time.

But worst of all is the direction of the concert. Candide is a timeless tale, and its power lies in the universal message.  Inserting jokes about catholic priests buying boys to molest, placing a Donald Trump imitator as a judge of the inquisition, and countless other gags not only are not funny, but they show how little understanding of the material the directing team has.

If you are favoring a more ""operatic"" version of Candide probably you would prefer Deutsche Gramphon's directed by Bernstein himself, but if you want a non stopping 116 minutes of top american musical stage and ALSO the purest spirit of Bernstein play, this is the one for you.

2246595,5,B0007WFXZI,"Although this is not the full version of Leonard Bernstein's operetta, it is certainly a spectacular live concert performance from Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall. Everything about this production is superb: the orchestra (conducted by Marin Alsop), clever staging and props, and dazzling performances by Kristin Chenoweth as Cunegonde, Paul Groves as Candide, Patti LuPone as The Old Lady, with supporting roles by Sir Thomas Allen (Dr. Pangloss), Jeff Blumenkrantz (Maximillian), and Janine LaManna (Paquette).

In consideration of ""the best of all possible worlds"", this is certainly the best of all previous Candides to have on DVD. Oh, how I wished I could have been there!, and now I am with this amazing presentation of Bernstein's masterpiece. And for those who only know of Kristin Chenoweth from ""Pushing Daisies"" on TV, her operatic skills and humorous stage presence is a triumphal achievement from my view and will simply astound you. That having been said, I must also admit that the cast is perfectly suited throughout, (both in solo and ensemble chorales). Paul Groves is also superb in the lead and Patti LuPone is (of course) a seasoned pro of the Broadway stage.

I am simply thrilled that this production for THIRTEEN/WNET (Great Performances) was released on DVD for all to enjoy for many years to come. Thank you Ellen M. Krass, Mort Swinsky, Jac Venza and Lonny Price! This production ranks 5 Stars in the company of all Broadway and off-Broadway shows.

2246600,2,B0007WFXZI,"I understand that Candide is satire and so did Leonard.  That being said some of what is in the book and some of what Lenny wrote is meant to be farce, even absurd.  However, a prevailing characteristic of good satire is that it is not all farce.  Buried in the hyperbole is an underlying message maybe even a solution to the insanity that unfolds.  I never could quite grasp that in the book, not until I met this music.  When performed properly there is such splendor, a trip from the highest moments of humor to utter despair, to passionate love, and loveless passion, all in Bernstein's Candide.  Furthermore, with the musical themes developing as the characters do the prevailing message is lucid and perfectly timed.

Unfortunately this performance misses the boat completely.  There is much farce and humor but the rest is gone.  No despair, no real love, no message, just farce and plenty of it.  If all you are interested in is Kristin Chenoweth's voice then this is a good performance to have.  She is splendid.  But, for the love of Lenny, don't consider this a good performance of Candide.

I saw this on PBS and in that performance I'd swear Candide's Lament was missing!  'Candide's Lament' is staple Tenor repertoire and is one of the main reasons the musical is so great. Not to mention the melody from the song is a persistent theme throughout the musical that molds from a lament to the 'Make our Garden Grow' existential affirmation.  How can you leave it out!! And I will never forgive them for laughing in the middle of the 'one' duet at the end of 'You were dead you know'.

If you don't understand than I invite you to listen to 'You were dead you know' from the GP recording and compare it to the same track on the 'Bernstein conducts Candide' album.  The second is much more operatic while the first is more Broadway but regardless, the second is in every way a superior rendition.  The same holds true for every track ... with the possible exception of 'Glitter and be Gay'.  Kristin was made for that song.

Bottom line: Despite what the title says this is not Leonard Bernstein's Candide.  It is an immature attempt to strip the passion from the music and leave nothing but the surface humor behind.  If you like Kristin then I suppose it is worth having, otherwise go for the 'Bernstein conducts Candide' recording (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bernstein-Conducts-Candide/dp/B000001GWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bernstein Conducts Candide</a>).

2246601,5,B0007WFXZI,"This is a wonderful take on one of my favorites. Kristin Chenoweth is indeed superb, the presentation is witty, ingenious, lively, and filled with the sardonic fun Voltaire clearly intended and every production beginning with the first revival production with new libretto (the successor to Hellman's)has aimed for. This one succeeds on just about every level. Chenoweth's ""Glitter and be Gay"" is, I think, perhaps as well as it can be done.

Still, as good as this is, it misses the mastery of the 1986 New York City Opera PBS production introduced by Beverly Sills, executive directed by Hal Prince with Candide sung by an amazing David Eisler, Cunegonde with lyrical perfection by Erie Mills, and the Old Lady by the incredibly hilarious and on-target Muriel Costa-Greenspon.  As good as Lupone is (and she's wonderful), Costa-Greenspon IS the Old Lady! This production is not available, only God knows why. I happened to have videotaped it in 1986 and just recently transferred it to DVD--a bit faded with some lessening of sound quality--but it is still a masterpiece. The program included a conversation between Sills and Prince in the intermission which is very illuminating for many reasons, not the least of which is intimate theater history. Someone needs to kick down the doors of Lincoln Center, PBS, and the New York City Opera archives and rescue  this production and release it on DVD with enhancements and the aforementioned conversation. Please!

In the meantime, this version is very highly recommended. As usual, the finale, ""And Make Our Garden Grow,"" (expertly presented) overwhelmed me and moved me to tears. It filled me with such a love for humanity and our striving to find meaning, my heart nearly broke with it.

It's not possible go wrong with this DVD.",1172620800,6,1781,5.023728813559322

2246603,5,B0007WFXZI,"Voltaire's ""Candide"" is a direct attack on Christianity and a mockery of the idea of divine providence.  Voltaire was responding through ""Candide"" to Leibniz the naive philosopher who used rational arguments to explain God's plan for the world.  Voltaire gives us ""Candide"" to show how chaos and chance rule, not god's loving guidance.  My understanding of the controversy that Voltaire wanted to inflame comes from an entry in ""Journal Encyclopedique"" (written 1759).
Bernstein's ""Candide"" is incredibly brilliant because not only does it capture Voltaire's critique of divine guidance in the world, the operetta also capture's Voltaire's playfulness.  The best example is the song ""The Best of All Possible Worlds.""  This song begins with an attack on formal arguments that the Christian scholastics borrowed from Aristotle: the syllogism.  The Christian scholastics (e.g. Thomas Aquinas) used numbered arguments in a formal form to ""prove"" everything from god's existence to divine providence.  Pangloss's song begins saying ""Let us review Lesson 11, paragraph 2, axiom 7""  This is a mockery of the scholastic form of defending Christianity.  The song continues, ""once one dismisses the rest of all possible worlds, one finds that this is the best of all possible worlds"" this is an mockery of the form of Christianity that was prevalent at the time Voltaire was writing.
My 3 favorite songs from Bernstein's ""Candide"" are:  ""Best of all Possible Worlds"" (attacks a form of Christianity), ""Auto-Da-Fe"" (attacks Christian inquisitions), ""Glitter and be gay"" (a variation on the attack of rationalizing tragedy). The melody of these songs (and the other songs) is contagious and the performances are spectacular.
Bernstein has the character Candide (finally educated at the end) say, ""We will build a small farm, and casting aside all vain speculations as to the meaning of this meaningless world.""

2246609,5,B0007WFXZI,"The first time I watched this DVD, I was a bit disappointed that I was watching a concert opera performance.  There is so much potential for great staging in this wonderful American work.  That disappointment faded quickly in the wake of some wonderful performances.

Before the review, let me also recommend that you read the original Voltaire novel.  It is wickedly funny, and will make you appreciate this brilliant score even more.

""Candide"" doesn't work at all without a skilled orchestra.  I have performed the overture to ""Candide"" on three different concerts. Trust me, there's nothing easy about it.  Up and coming conducting superstar Marin Alsop leads a New York Philharmonic that continues to get better every year.  Bravo to this wonderful orchestra and Maestra Alsop!

As for the cast, we'll start with the highly credentialed Sir Thomas Allen doubling as narrator and Dr. Pangloss.  Mr. Allen has enjoyed a distinguished opera career, and one can certainly see why.  Janine LaManna makes a wonderful Paquette.  She's gorgeous, sexy, and has a beautiful soprano instrument to match.  Jeff Blumenkrantz was hilarous as Maximillian.  Playing Maximillian as gay was an interesting artistic choice, but it worked in the hands of Blumenkrantz.  Broadway megastar Patti LuPone gives us a very nice turn as The Old Lady.  I didn't particularly care for her entrance.  Her (real) name is ""announced"" via cards, by the chorus, and she takes a bow.  Theatrically, she's out of character, and the bow disrupts the continuity of the show.  Her performance was wonderful, so no deductions for silly staging are given here.  Paul Groves as Candide was fabulous.  In addition to bringing a solid tenor instrument to the part, he looked and acted every bit the naive, childlike character Voltaire intended.

Kristin Chenoweth gets her own paragraph.  What an amazing performer she is!  I has the privilege of seeing her sing the role of Glinda (or Ga-linda if you prefer) in ""Wicked"".  She was amazing.  ""Candide"" is a different story though, primarily because of the fiendishly difficult coloratura aria ""Glitter and Be Gay"".  It was astounding.  I've heard two other sopranos sing this aria; June Anderson and Renee Fleming.  Neither of those distinguished sopranos can touch Kristin.  On top of her prodigious vocal talents, she is a wonderful actress and energetic performer.  She's just one of those special talents that comes along all too rarely, and you simply can't take your eyes off of her.

I highly recommend this DVD, in case you couldn't tell.",1167436800,6,2557,5.086746987951807

As a fan of Wicked (Kristin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel, Stephen Schwartz) I love Kristin Chenoweth, and when I found that she was in this, I immediatley purchased it. I have read other customer reviews and some say that while the performance is brilliant, the quality is not great. I have watched this both on a compuer (Windows XP) and on my DVD player (Sony) and have no problem with the quality of the recording at all.

This concert is Leonard Bernstein's Candide, based on Voltaire's Candide. As a musical operetta, the cast is over qualified for it. The singing is beautiful, and the music is done by New York Philharmonic does justice to Leonard's beautiful arrangement.

Great songs from the show include: Life is Happiness Indeed, Glitter and Be Gay, My love, We are Women, and The Sheep Song. However of course, all are wonderfully entertaining.

This concert production, regardless of its gimmicks (the passing of a West Side Story record during ""It Must Be So"", the ""bang"" flag coming out of a fake gun as it is shot off, Donald Trump presiding over the ""Auto-Da-Fe"" proceedings, etc., etc.), is fantastic, mainly due to its stellar cast. I am a huge fan of Kristin Chenoweth, and her performance as Cunegonde is spectacular. Her ""Glitter and Be Gay"" sounds and looks effortless, and her comic timing is impeccable. Paul Groves as Candide is wonderful, and his tenor voice is lovely. Sir Thomas Allen, doubling as the Narrator and Dr. Pangloss, is hilarious and his voice is absolutely magnificent. Jeff Blumenkrantz as the humorous, over-the-top, narcissistic Maximilian is a standout...he turns a supporting role into something to be remembered. Although many of these reviewers disagree with me, Patti LuPone is wonderful as the Old Lady...although she doesn't have an operatic voice, she is really a fantastic actress, and her presence is incomparable.

2246616,4,B0007WFXZI,"I'm very familiar with several versions of Bernstein's marvelous musical Candide. I'd never go so far as to say that this ought to be the new definitive production, but Lonny Price did a wonderful job of reinventing the musical for the concert.

The most prominent productions of Candide were conceived and directed by Hal Prince. While his production was wonderfully innovative in bringing the story back to the fun of Voltaire's original novel (and the fun sound of Bernstein's score) by scrapping Lillian Hellman's poetic, though terribly stodgy, 1956 script and replacing it with a new vibrant libretto by Hugh Wheeler, Prince's version is 30 years old, and we were due for a new envisioning.

I was lucky enough to see the revival of the Prince production at NYC Opera last season, and though still the wonderful musical I love, it showed it age, and felt a little stale. Lonny Price's new conception for this concert was like a breath of fresh air. Rather than try to go back to the serious nature people tend to feel ought to go along with Candide (probably because of the complexity and enormity of the score, though those people are missing the point of the Voltaire novel completely), Price made it more absurd, and brought out the comedy to its fullest wherever possible.

The performances by Patti LuPone, Kristin Chenoweth, Janine LaManna and Jeff Blumenkrantz (all seasoned Broadway performers) as well as opera singer Paul Groves are all spot-on, hilarious, and beautifully sung. The chorus and orchestra are all top-notch, under the baton of Marin Alsop, who appears to be having more fun with the music than ought to be legal.

Now, as this is a concert, some of the plot elements have been condensed, and some elements of the original Hellman book were reinstated, making some of the plot more convoluted than even Candide needs to be. This, I felt, hurt the overall flow of the production. But for overall performance, this is a wonderful production. Also, because of the fun, this is a great introduction to the glorious music to those who are unfamiliar with the musical.",1136764800,8,2092,4.867977528089888

2246619,2,B0007WFXZI,"Until I saw this performance on public TV, I had not liked Candide. But this performance changed my mind, so when I saw it was available on DVD I bought it.

Some of the other reviewers critized the fact that it deviated from the origonal broadway production. Since the origonal production was not very sucessful (at least for a Bernstein musical) it seems quite justified to make some changes.

The trouble with Candide is that the story in completely ridiculous, so any attempt to play it straight will seem silly. Here, all the performers convey the idea they are having great fun doing this ridiculous musical which makes it fun for the audience too. In addition, the conducting and singing are excellent.",1128470400,4,709,4.80327868852459
2246620,2,B0007WFXZI,"Sorry, but Bernstein had wanted a huge, bombastic show as can be witnessed by his last recording with the then still marvelous Nicolai Gedda as the Governer.

Lonny Price's rendition is just a lot of schtick for no good reason but to put the show on at the cheapest cost possible. Indeed, it is a concert but also a bastardization closer to the irrevent debacle that was Harold Prince's version in the 1970's. I cannot believe artists won't return to Lillian Hellman's book. I own a copy and know how this version must have inspired one of the most magnificent scores in Broadway history. It is a shame that this concert will be such a poor reference point for such a crowning achievement.",1125532800,14,689,4.6016260162601625

2246622,4,B0007WFXZI,"Ah, for the love of ""Candide."" If you want the incomparable music sung very well, this is a worthy performance, vocally outstanding in almost every department. The semi-staging, however, is desperate not to lose the audience for a single minute -- hence the crammed-in wisecracks, doltish sight gags, mugging, campiness (""beggary"" becomes a sniggering pun on ""buggery""), and soon-t-be-outdated topical references, as when the Grand Inquisitor turns into Donald Trump telling a condemned heretic, ""You're fired"" as the hapless victim is led off to be burned.

I suppose Bernstein's hapless musical, here stripped of any attempt voltaire's satire, can't be successfully staged in its original form, which flopped with Broadway audiences half a century ago. As its many admirers know, Candide has been through endless revisions since the original run in 1956-57. After the classic cast recording with Barbara Cook and Robert Rounseville, future recordings have been troubled by Harold Prince's notion that Candide and Cunegonde should be played as brainless children.  Turning a mock-operetta, with its acerbic but muddled book by Lillian Hellman, into a broad comic romp turned out to be the last word -- even Bernstein threw up his hands and recorded it that way on DG. His version suffers from variable vocals and more than a touch of the lugubrious, inflated style that the aging Bernstein too often lapsed into. In this concert performance from Lincoln Center, many liberties are taken with story and staging, but essentially it's a complete score. Mediocre lyrics sit side by side with briliant ones, and even the brilliant ones are camped up (even Candide's ineffably touching lmanet,""It Must Be So,"" is desecrated for cheap laughs).

I didn't like seeing this classic score marred by doltish clowning, but I had to admire the excellent singing and playing throughout. Of special delight was the discovry that Broadway baby Kristin Chemoweth possesses a colorature of operatic calaiber, just what the composer wanted.",1124496000,11,2021,5.329153605015674
2246623,2,B0007WFXZI,"The frenetic and inappropriate staging of this concert ruined an otherwise mostly good to great presentation of Leonard Bernstein's score for me. What happened to the director since the concert version of ""Sweeney Todd""? That concert was great, but here the cheap gimmicks/visual jokes employed throughout constantly got in the way of the music.

The director apparently thought that staging ""Candide"" a la ""A funny thing happened on the way to the forum"" would be a great idea, but compared to ""Forum"" the book for ""Candide"" by Hugh Wheeler is much too cynical and just not funny enough to warrant such a decision. There's a vast difference between a Voltarian satire and a TV sitcom, which is why  the topical updates will date this DVD rather quickly ( I doubt that anyone will want to watch it 10 years from today!).

Examples of the director screwing up scenes: A drag show accompanying the ""Paris Waltz"" (this is Paris in the 18th century, not ""La cage aux folles"" in the 1970's). The great duet "" We are women"", one of the highlights in the score,  is interrupted by silly spoken references to baseball and soccer and never again gains momentum. Donald Trump presiding over the ""Auto-Da-Fe"" proceedings. The comic schtick during ""It must be so"" was totally destracting and completely ruined that lyrical song through inappropriate audience laughter.

Kristin Chenoweth's singing was certainly up to the demands of the score which is operatic and not your typical musical comedy stuff.  She performed ""Glitter and be gay"" as a vaudeville act which was  funny per se,  but again, the visual presentation was at the expense of the music. Since Patti LuPone is a Broadway belter and not an opera mezzo, her vocal part was changed to comply with  her vocal limitations (most evident in the ""First Act finale"", where she couldn`t sing the high notes as written). However, her ""I'm easily assimilated"" was great fun. The other singers were good to excellent, with  Paul Groves and Sir Thomas Allen being the standouts. The conducting and orchestra was first rate.

But why an abridged version of the overture?? This is one of the most popular concert pieces of 20th century American music and they play only half of it?

Bottom line: If you're not familiar with ""Candide"", get one of the cast recordings and wait for Bernstein's unmarred by gimmicks Barbican  concert to be released on DVD anytime soon.",1123977600,31,2403,4.889162561576355
2246624,3,B0007WFXZI,"I've heard several recordings of Candide, and saw the Broadway production in the late 70's.  Maybe there isn't a ""perfect"" version, particularly since Bernstein kept tinkering with it.  The text is so synical I wish it were in a foreign language.  How does one ""do"" Candide?  Heavy-handed, preachy, as a light comedy, a farce?  I'd prefer a straight-forward comic approach that keeps the mean-spirited aspects to a minimum.  This version is OK, but lacking what a full-blown production could do.  It's somewhat like the concert version Bernstein himself did for PBS.",1123632000,10,566,5.153846153846154
2246625,4,B0007WFXZI,"Lonny Price has, by and large, directed an extraordinary event and captured it on video for all of us to enjoy.  I felt that I truly had an orchestra seat at an excellent performance - stage-to-video doesn't get much better than that.

Hearing Bernstein's score played by this huge marvelous orchestra and sung by a cast/chorus that has the right balance of excellent voices AND the exuberance necessary for ""musical theatre"" is a treat.

Price has used the very limited staging opportunities of Avery Fisher Hall to bring fun and life to a staged concert.  It reinforces that usually, simplicity is the best choice if the material is solid.

The use of  chorus-as-card-section is great fun.  His casting is great fun - Paul Groves in lederhosen is always a believable innocent Candide. Who'd have guessed that bald, bespectacled Jeff Blumenkrantz  is perfect as the narcissistic Maximillian. Sir Thomas Allen as Pangloss: nothing short of brilliant.  And clearly conductor Marin Alsop and the orchestra are having great fun as well.

What I don't understand is why Price allowed the staging and the actors to drift into ""cute"" and ""indulgent"" at various points in the production.

Cute:  at one of the most touching points of the story - when Candide begins his journey into the world - with nothing but optimism to sustain him - Price screws it up.  Competing with Paul Groves sensitive and beautiful performance of  ""It Must Be So,""  is the cheap gimmick of the chorus passing Candide's beloved possessions down the row and into his roll-on bag .... A baseball glove, a Frisbee, and a cherished West Side Story album (huge laughs from Bernstein fans long before we know what they're laughing at)  then the thump thump thump as the roller bag goes down stairs.  The audience laughs.  It's cute.  It's insy-poo ..... but the staging doesn't help the story. Indeed the staging is clashing with the moment.  This is a moment for simplicity - not a movement onstage, just a pin spot on Candide alone in the world- not a moment to be blown off with ""cute.""

Indulgent:  OK, I'm not a huge fan of Chenoweth.  She's lovely, she has a great instrument ....  But there is a bulletproof shield around her that not even that voice can shatter.  She never allows us to sympathize with Cunegonde and so we really don't care much about her travails.  Chenoweth's  Glitter and Be Gay  is a series of disjointed ""bits""  -  OK, so Chenoweth can sing the notes - so what if she fails to tell a story, to develop her character, or  to be anything other than ... well  Ms. Chenoweth onstage doing some schtick that had nothing to do with the rest of the play?  It isn't clear to me whether Price didn't or couldn't direct Chenoweth - whichever, it was incredibly disappointing.  For this 6 minutes, I wanted so desperately to see young Barbara Cook onstage ... BEING Cunegonde.

If anyone even bothers to read this, BUY THE DVD NOW!!!  It is, overall a great production, you'll have a grand time.  My disappointment is that with half a dozen relatively minor fixes - removing the cute and the indulgent - this would have been an excellent production.",1123286400,29,3132,4.7227356746765246
2246626,5,B0007WFXZI,"I and my friends found this highly enjoyable. The cast is uniformly excellent--in fact Kristin Chenoweth is truly remarkable--although famed Patti LuPone's forced foreign accent make some of her lines unintelligible. Marin Alsop conducts the New York Philharmonic with verve and style. Great fun, and great music.",1122422400,4,313,5.680851063829787
2246627,4,B0007WFXZI,"This is all around an excellent concert production.  As everyone has said, Kristen Chenoweth is a fabuolous Cunegonde.  Her performance of Glitter and Be Gay is stunning -- I watched it three times when I first saw it.  The semi-staging is fun and lively and brings some visual energy to what might have been a static presentation.  Some of the ideas don't work or are a bit too cute, but the effort to enliven the concert experience is largely successful.

I have two reservations.

First, Paul Groves as Candide.  Groves has a lovely tenor voice and he sings beautifully a lot of the time.  However, his lower register is simply awful -- most of the low notes are either growled or missed completely.  I can't believe no one else has pointed this out.  This meant that virtually every song he sings is in some degree ruined.

Second, Patti LuPone.  I have never particularly been a LuPone fan, but even aside from that, whatever appeal she does have does not lie in comedy.  As the Old Lady, her performance is utterly un-funny and un-charming.  Her version of I Am Easily Assimilated is kind of ruined because of this.  She comes across as hard, coarse, obvious and rather annoying.  LuPone is beter in musical roles that are dramatic rather than comic in nature -- e.g. Evita, Sunset Boulevard.  Compare her to true musical COMEDY stars -- Gwen Verdon, Faith Prince, and of course Kristen Chenoweth -- and you see how ineffective LuPone is in this kind of role.",1122336000,12,1465,4.66015625
2246628,5,B0007WFXZI,"As a child I grew up listening to the Barbara Cook version of this performance.  I was so happy that a new version was made.  Kristin Chenoweth proves to be a dominating force on the stage.  Paul Groves portays Candide with an innocence that belies his age...but that is where our imagination comes in.  If you close your eyes and just listen and imagine, this performance is a gem. The orchestration is lush and the staging is different.  This performance delivers and Candide can do just about anything.  Excellent!",1121731200,3,517,4.752808988764045
2246629,4,B0007WFXZI,"I can't get Chenoweth's rendition of ""Glitter and Be Gay"" out of my head.  Not only is she vocally gorgeous, she made me laugh hysterically.

As for the production, it is charming.  I have never seen CANDIDE before, so as an ""introduction"", this DVD serves its purpose.

I can't help but wonder if we are seeing a ""reimagined"" version, though.  While watching it, I thought that the show was probably done more ""straight"" in its earlier inceptions. And after reading some of the reviews here, I was right.

The digital re-framing does not ruin the viewing experience, but it is noticeable. I kept wondering if they'd tinkered with the vertical and horizontal framing of a scene many times -- so, although it doesn't ruin the DVD, it *is* distracting. However, I must admit I love any video that is presented in Anamorphic format -- it looks great on my widescreen TV.  (FOSSE is an example of a first-class digital, widescreen DVD.)",1121040000,13,932,4.751552795031056
2246630,5,B0007WFXZI,"Based on the wickedly funny satire by Voltaire, CANDIDE was originally produced on Broadway in 1956.  The Leonard Bernstein score was greatly admired, as were the lyrics from an unexpected combination of Richard Wilbur, John Latouche, and Dorothy Parker.  Sadly, the script by Lillian Hellman and the production as a whole proved hamfisted, to say the least, and in spite of a legendary performance by Barbara Cook the show closed after a mere seventy three performances.

On-going admiration made the original cast album a favorite in theatre circles, and over the years there have been numerous attempts to revive CANDIDE--but each attempt proved problematic at best.  Even when Hellman's script was discarded, the show simply proved impossible to stage... until 2004, when director Lonny Price staged the piece for a limited engagement at Lincoln Center.

Like most post-1956 directors, Price largely discarded the Hellman script.  He also went quite a bit further: he makes no effort to ""stage"" CANDIDE in a traditional style.  Placing no less than the New York Philharmonic and Westminister Symphonic Choir in the middle of the stage, using a minimum of props and even fewer costumes, Price has his actors romp through the orchestra and play directly and pointedly to the audience--and the result is theatre at its most theatrical and most uniquely powerful.

The cast is superior.  Paul Groves and Kristin Chenoweth offer memorable vocals in the leading roles of Candide and his lady love Cunegonde, and while Chenoweth doesn't manage to best Barbara Cook's memorable performance she at least equals it; in her hands the famous ""Glitter and be Gay"" proves as comic as it is beautiful.  Sir Thomas Allen provides tremendous stability in multiple roles, including the misguided Dr. Pangloss.  Patti LuPone is somewhat less effective; although she performs both script and score with the remarkable vocal skills and tremendous aplomb for which she is so famous, she seems faintly miscast as The Old Lady.  Even so, this indeed Patti LuPone in full stride, and that compensates for a great deal.

Like most theatre-to-film projects, CANDIDE has the occasional photography problem, but over all film director Fritz Zeilinger captures the excitement of this memorable live performance without major gaffes.  If you are a fan of the score who has never seen the play in performance--well, as Dr. Pangloss might say, this is indeed the best of all possible productions.  Greatly recommended.

Well, it's finally here, and EVERYONE should buy it!  It's hilariously funny, the music is superb, and it's just plain fun.

2246632,5,B0007WFXZI,"Not everyone will agree on which production/cast/version of ""Candide"" is their favorite.  Fine.  Go on about your separate ways on that.  But this Lincoln Center production from 2004, a delight to see released on DVD, is what fun at the theatre is all about.

I've listened to Bernstein's 1989 ""final"" version of this operetta so many times I have every note memorized.  This new Lincoln Center version is just as polished, just as marvelously sung, and an absolute joy to watch.  Some of the comic schtick is a bit tired, but not so much that it detracts from the overall fun of the show.  There are some changes to the lyrics early on, but this particular piece has evolved its music and lyrics so much over the past 50 years how can you really nail one version down as the definitive one?

There are some video problems during Cunegonde's ""Glitter and Be Gay"" number, and some too-frenetic editing makes it worse.  But this DVD is the filmed version of one single performance of a total of four staged at Avery Fisher Hall.  It was a production decision to tape just one night instead of taping multiple shows and editing together the best bits of each into one DVD version.  So if there were some occasional focus or digital zoom snafus with the camera operators, well tough tushy -- small price to pay, IMHO.  Other reviewers here say that the video problems are due to technical issues in the pressing/coding of the DVD.  Whatever.  Whichever the case is, it is a momentary gaffe and easily forgivable in light of the overall product.

After listening to various recordings of this work since I was a child in the 1970's, this is the first visual presentation I've seen of it, and I am more than satisfied with it.  And I bet you will be too.

The store I went to to purchase this only had 2 copies in stock.  I bought both of them.  One for me, and one to whomever I eventually give one as a gift.  But I was not about to let the second copy languish on the shelf in obscurity in my small-minded, culturally-stunted small Southern town.
