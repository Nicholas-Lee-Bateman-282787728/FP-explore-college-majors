8083364,5,B000B8I9VS,"Moby Dick has a very artistic feel to it. The story is top notch and the development of the characters is truly great. We see how the future will be like for whale hunters in the future. The whole idea of hunting old space ships that have been abandoned and calling them whales is truly amusing. For those who love a great anime series and a new take on an old great tale, I suggest giving this version of Moby Dick a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1195948800,3,452,4.206896551724138
