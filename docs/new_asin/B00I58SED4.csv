8639333,5,B00I58SED4,I would give this one 10 stars if I could. I first saw this one on channel 13 when I was living in Los Angeles in 1983. I could never find a region 1 DVD copy of it for over thirty years. I now have a region one copy and I must say that this one is worth watching over at least once a year.,1503360000,,290,3.476923076923077
8639334,5,B00I58SED4,"The content was everything I expected. The picture quality was consistent with the standard definition in which the producers made it. A good chance to remember the Eighties. Of course I played the English version, and the voices were the same as I remembered when I first viewed the program, thirty years ago.",1461715200,,310,4.867924528301887
