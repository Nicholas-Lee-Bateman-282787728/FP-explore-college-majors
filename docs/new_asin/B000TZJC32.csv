2912179,4,B000TZJC32,"I am a bit surprised more people haven't reviewed this item. This set is great, whether you're a fan of the live action series or a kid who likes somewhat creepy cartoons. However, this was quite different from the actual HBO series. They did for the most part keep the music and John Kassir once again does the cryptkeeper's voice. The cryptkeeper gets a lot of screen time and makes cameo appearances in many of the episodes. All of the Universal Studios monsters make appearances as well even if they don't refer to them as Frankenstein, et al. Every story involves kids as the main characters getting in trouble with monsters or haunted houses so yes, the stories are a bit cheezy, but still fun. As an old comics fan, they remind me of DC's House of Secrets comic books of the 70's and 80's more than HBO's Tales From The Crypt. If you're a fan of the show or genre you owe it to yourself to get at least one season on DVD. I got mine for under $8 and it was well worth it. I'd be willing to pay twice that much.",1261958400,9,1017,4.247422680412371
2912180,3,B000TZJC32,"As a kid growing up in the 80's, I had the privledge to watch such cartoons as Ghostbusters, Beetlejuice, My Pet Monster, and other greats that warped my little mind. I had no knowledge of this show however, but I'm sure it would have been a regular in my cartoon line up. Now as an adult in my mid 20's, I stumbled upon this DVD. I decided that since my husband and I were such fans of ""Tales from the Crypt"" it was worth a watch... and it was. The cartoons are a bit cheesy (they are from the 80's) but they all had that great morale endings. We have a 6 yr old who is following in our footsteps, and loves the spooky stuff as well. She really enjoyed the DVD! She is watching it every day at this point, so we've decided to buy the 2nd season. Great little throwback to your childhood if you grew up loving that type of cartoon!",1261353600,4,831,4.073170731707317

2912182,5,B000TZJC32,"This is an excellent release for any Tales from the Crypt fan, EC comics fan, or monster-kid of the early 90's. The quality is excellent and the show is just how I remember it. My only problem with this release is the lack of special features, which will not lower my rating because:
A. This was a children's show.
B. What could they possibly include?

It is important to note that this is a Canadian release, which has yet to receive a US license. However, it is Region 1 and will make an excellent addition to all fans of the series.

Now if only they would release Escape from the Cryptkeeper's Haunted Castle game show -- That would be great!",1229385600,4,646,4.375

This is a really good cartoon show, especialy if you're a Tales From The Crypt fan. Those episodes are more for kid than adult, but it's a blast from the past for me, and it's still very good !

This DVD Box Set is a two DVD disc with all the 14 stories that contain the first season. English only language track, 2.0 Stereo.

2912205,3,B000TZJC32,"It seems odd to think that anybody would look at HBO's very adult anthology series, ""Tales From the Crypt"", and think there was material for a children's cartoon--and a game show!--in the idea of a moldy corpse telling stories of poetic justice full of sex and brutality. That's not to say I'm complaining; as a kid, I loved the series! I only saw the cartoon once or twice (I distinctly remembered one about two boys that get sucked into a video game and meet Slugzilla).

The cartoon series isn't any better or worse than innumerable nineties cartoon shows; the animation is mediocre, the stories are broad morality tales and the humor is just as sophomoric as it is in it predecessor. You'll get more than your fair share of puns in this one, I guarantee.

Unlike ""Tales from the Crypt"", this cartoon suffers from a lack of anything really distinctive. The show isn't scary, thought provoking or engaging on any deeper level than in a ""it'll kill half an hour"" kind of way. John Kassar does provide the voice for the Cryptkeeper, though, and that's worth something. Honestly, the host segments weren't that bad; they impressively replicated the humorous tone of the series without getting too graphic or ribald.

The most disappointing part of the show was the stilted animation, which was done similarly to ""Arthur"" and ""The Magic School Bus"" shows from around the same time. The motion isn't fluid nor very detailed. While I can't say I found anything overly interesting with this show, it's a decent way to introduce kids to the horror genre without scaring them silly. We can't let them get too freaked out, or anything.",1410739200,,1627,4.782918149466192
2912206,4,B000TZJC32,If your looking for a top animated cartoon then your looking in the wrong place.....if you remember this from back then it will not hold up to your memories.. if you just like a fun cartoon then click buy it now.  this dvd set is fun (in small doses) for the whole family it usually ends with kind of a moral.so not to bad.,1395792000,,323,4.046875
2912207,5,B000TZJC32,I really enjoy these little stories and love the animation art. This is great for the intro alone! Great to own for any horror fans collection.,1394496000,,143,4.538461538461538
2912208,5,B000TZJC32,"I just re-watched this show again, and wow, this was even BETTER than the first viewing! This is truly the best monster show of all time and in my opinion, better than the original 1980's live-action show! The original is still perfect, but this is superb beyond all comprehension, I HIGHLY recommend this to all Tales from the Crypt fans and fans of animated shows that are about monsters, there are so few amazing ones as this, and this one truly takes the cake! This first season has a TON of vampire's, even the greatest monster ever, such as (the best of all monsters) Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolfman, and The Mummy. This show is all around perfection! There is a Monkey's Paw that grants horrific wishes, a killer car that was obviously based on Christine, many horrifyingly cool vampire's, many zombie's, wax figure's that transport you into a universe of their own much like the movie Waxworks and much, much more of ghoulicious delicious fun! Get this before it gets you!

2912212,3,B000TZJC32,I rated this three stars as I found the animation quality to be sorely lacking.

2912254,4,B000TZJC32,"It was when I was twelve years old that I uncovered this new series they were passing on television. A children-version of the adult and graphic Tales from The Crypt, it featured the perfect John Kassir as the cryptkeeper, and invovled people from the original HBO production team like executive producer Robert Zemeckis. Though this time, this children series would be in animation, a Nelvana production, and would be monitored by psychological experts to make sure that there was nothing traumatising out of those stories. Which I personnally think is ridiculous since there are more violent and inhumane content shown in daytime tabloid talk shows, also known as ""Ambush TV"", (ie: Jenny Jones, Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Montel Williams, etc.) and more innuendos in soap operas (ie: Days of our lives, Bold and Beautiful) than what children watch during afternoon or saturday morning TV, or read in fairy tales or in books.

For this series, we have fourteen stories (two in one episode) that involve ordinary people fighting off or encountering a supernatural creature or environment, from which they grow up and learn life values. Though at times, the story's morale is quoted out loud by the cryptkeeper or by the characters. As if to make sure that we got the concept of the story, which wasn't necessary since by watching the story and seeing the charcters evolve, we can identify the message of the story by ourselves. Which was what the original Tales form the Crypt series did, although through heavy dark humour or macabre irony, from which the cryptkeeper would pinpoint out and laugh it off in his cruel laughter. Of my favorite stories, the ones I loved were ""Gone Fishin"", with an ending much closer to the original series than the other stories, ""the Sleeping Beauty"", ""Gorilla's Paw"", ""This wraps it up"", and ""A little body of work"".

In its production values, the series offers background and character designs very close to what the comic books offered. However, the animation has many bloopers and mistakes such as characters layers passing over or through elements when it shouldn't be, perspective mistakes, drawing mistakes, camera bloopers, coloring bloopers on characters, etc. In the end, some of the animation bloopers made it difficult for me to appreciate what some of the stories had to offer. Not only that, I wish that they could have also put the French dubbing on this disc like they did for Redwall for, like Redwall, that dubbing offered excellent performances from the actors. And even though they sometimes modified or enhanced some of the dialogues which might stand out as bland, they gave richer layers to the storylines and better dialogues which stayed in the context of the story.

Nevertheless, I have to thank this series for if it hadn't been for ""Tales from the Cryptkeeper"", I wouldn't have found out about the original series on HBO or the original comic books that caused such a controversy in the fifties.

In the end, this series allowed me to recollect pleasant memories from my childhood.",1369612800,3,3047,4.980353634577603

2912258,5,B000TZJC32,I used to watch these cartooons on Saturdays as a kid. It is kind of creepy but funny too. Each story has a lesson to learn or be reminded of. I enjoy that most about the series.

2912259,4,B000TZJC32,These were just as good as I remembered. I used to watch every saturday with my sister and dad.

2912261,4,B000TZJC32,"The Tales from the Cryptkeeper was a Saturday morning cartoon, yes you read that right. The stories were great and sometimes scary. I was always excited to watch this show every saturday morning when it came out. The stories range from scary haunted houses to mummys chasing after you. Any kid who has had the pleasure of growing up in a household with parents who have taught them to watch scary movies at a young age, will surely enjoy this one. This is a show that helped bring in a new breed of television shows.

This show helped inspire the creation of the HBO show, ""Tales from the Crypt."" A show that for anyone who loves a good terror now and then will enjoy. This show combined the effects of cartoon and horror at just the right pace. I always wanted more terror and gore but since it was a kids show, I had to make due. Other than that it has been great to watch it again and relive the memories of waking up early to watch great saturday morning programming.

For any great parent who enjoys teaching their kids great things, this is one they should introduce their children too. Every kid will enjoy the stories and for those kids that really get into them, you parents can show them where they got the true inspiration, the EC archives. Those are great comics to read just for the scary stories.

I do hope this review does help a couple of parents decide on buying this DVD set for their kids because the shows today are just so watered down, it's no wonder they spend all their time on their tablets now. Shows like this will bring them back to watching TV again.",1343001600,7,1580,4.36734693877551

8211546,5,B000TZJC32,"In the early 90s, Tales From the Crypt was spun off as a children's Saturday morning cartoon. The name was changed, slightly, to ""Tales From the Cryptkeeper."" This set contains the entire run of series 1 episodes.

Most episodes run around 22 minutes long, and this includes all 13 episodes/14 stories (one episode ran two-- 11 minute stories) on two discs. These are all full frame, which was the production standard from back then.

So, what's the show like?

If you have ever seen ""Are you Afraid of the Dark"" or ""Goosebumps"", you'll have a pretty good idea of what you're going to get here. Each episode features an intro by the cryptkeeper, before launching into an anthology type children's horror episode. Despite having monsters, zombies, vampires, etc--these episodes are kid friendly and each one is aimed at teaching a lesson in a way that is very entertaining and feels far less preachy than some other kids programs. The stories are pretty original, and it's just a very fun show in the vein of its HBO predecessor.

Even as an adult, I still find these stories fun and entertaining. While the stories may not be quite as good as ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"", the animation holds up well and I find it to be a better visual show than its other competitors from that era due to most live action shows from the 90s being so dark and grainy on today's televisions. That's not the case here, the colors are crisp and translate respectably well.

The show is great, the package is great. Really, all that's missing is bonus content. But from a show this old, what can you expect?",1487894400,,1587,4.613475177304965
