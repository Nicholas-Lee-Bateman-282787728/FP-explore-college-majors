8151014,4,B000JJSDFG,"I am a Bette Davis fanatic, so was very happy to get actual THIS IS YOUR LIFE bw DVD. It didn't, however, teach much that most of us don't already know. I did learn some new things about her from her body language and the tenor of the show. Unfortunately, some of the surprise guests did not play a very significant role in her life. If, like me, you want to collect BD's appearances, this should be added to your list.
What was crazy is that anyone would combine two such different actors as Mansfield and Davis in one tape and call it ""Sirens of the Silver Screen."" The most obvious ridiculousness is that Bette Davis, one of the world's greatest and most prolific actors, was never considered a ""siren."" As an aside, Jayne Mansfield came across as a really likable person in her surprise visit from Ralph Edwards, THIS IS  YOUR LIFE host. Hers was actually a more typical show (for those of us old enough to remember the original shows).",1222732800,3,940,4.465116279069767
8151015,5,B000JJSDFG,"What an odd combination but it somehow works. The Bette Davis show is great and it's good to see the whole show. There's no surprises here but it's highly entertaining from start to finish. Filmed in 1971 and the show is in color.
The Jayne Mansfield show is from around (at a guess) 1959 and here we see a different side of the platinum sex bomb - the family side, which is rather touching and sweet.
This DVD is very good value for money as both these shows are of a high standard.",1195689600,3,483,4.204301075268817
