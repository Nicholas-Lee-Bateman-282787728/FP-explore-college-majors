8075531,4,B000A7B5WU,"I would prefer a DVD that flows for an at home workout without being so geared to pilates instructors. I love Stott Pilates, but wish they would make more reformer DVDs that just flowed through a normal paced workout.",1375142400,2,217,4.589743589743589
8075532,4,B000A7B5WU,"Very good DVD.  I was looking for a DVD that would make me feel like I had my own personal guide in the room.  This is very good, although very long for a ""class"" ... 1.25 hours or so.  Great instruction, a little boring.",1369180800,,221,3.977272727272727
8075533,5,B000A7B5WU,The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The exercise is challenging and the pace is just right.  A great addition to my exercise routine.,1200528000,,145,4.76
8075534,5,B000A7B5WU,"This is a great video for anyone familiar with the Pilates Reformer. Not a beginner dvd, but it does carry on from the Stott Pilates Essential Reformer DVD. Moira is an awesome model for the moves, her body awareness is amazing. I bought this DVD first and because I was so inspired, I then purchased the Essential Reformer. Buying both is the best bet.",1194048000,2,353,4.53125
8075535,5,B000A7B5WU,"I got hooked on Moira Stott's (now Merrithew) videos years ago and this one continues her tradition of excellent teaching. The intermediate level really is an advance from the beginning level, rather than a rehash of the earlier techniques. While many of the same exercises are here, the intermediate version provide variations on them to make them far more challenging. Additionally, many new exercises are presented that further challenge both your strength and balance, to say nothing of control. Things like the one-legged elephant, for example, may be a piece of cake with four springs, but wait until you get down to only one or two or a half spring.

If you haven't already mastered Moira's beginning level, you should do so before moving on to this level, because you really will need all the skills from the beginning level to master the skills presented here.

If there's one drawback (and it's only a small one) it's that she moves much faster through these exercises than in the beginning version. But then, that's why we have a ""pause"" key on the remote.

Bottom line: This is an excellent presentation of a fairly demanding Pilates workout. And you'll want to give yourself plenty of time; there's a lot a material presented here. You're definitely getting your money's worth.

NOTE: I use a Balanced Body Reformer instead of the Pilates, but found no difficulty in using the Stott exercises on the Balanced Body machine.",1179360000,18,1435,4.917355371900826
