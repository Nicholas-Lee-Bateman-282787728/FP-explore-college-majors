8324401,5,B000E0EE3U,"I consider myself an empathetic person. Almost to a fault (I've come to realize.) Sometimes that empathy makes me feel weak. For a long time I searched for something to build my inner strength and give me a little extra protection. I don't ever want to become cold and unresponsive to the world and people around me, I just don't want it and them to affect me to the point that I'm exhausted and depressed. I practice yoga and I've tried traditional meditation but that hasn't always done it for me. I was thrilled to find and experience this DVD.
I would say the best way to describe Black Lotus is a sort of cousin of Tai Chi (though admittedly I've only done Tai Chi a few times and I have a good friend who creates ""energy balls"" as is mentioned in the DVD though my friend's instructor uses a ruler to discipline students- No Thanks!)
The very first time I used Black Lotus (I recommend you watch it through first and found it helpful to take notes) I experienced a tingling sensation in my hands and arms that's hard to describe. It was like they were buzzing. I was calm, centered and even more aware all without feeling depleted or soaking in other people's emotions. Especially their negativity. Score! Currently I practice Black Lotus at least once a week.
I now see the empathy I have for others as extremely powerful. Especially when I'm able to practice Black Lotus and protect myself, feel my strength and focus. Next? Memorizing all the moves so I can perform them anywhere- Life Goals!",1441756800,,1501,4.5424354243542435
8324402,2,B000E0EE3U,"The author does not explain the stances very well, in particular the placement of the feet. Should the feet point straight ahead, or should they be turned out at a 45 degree angle? The video shows the author with his feet turned out and lifting the front of the feet slightly in some of the exercises while moving the torso side to side. The author also does not mention anything about breathing. Are you supposed to inhale as you move to one side forming the energy ball between the hands and then exhale while moving back to the center, or are you simply to breathe normal throughout the exercise? The author does not address breathing.

While the exercise does create a feeling of extra energy from performing the movements, it seems to put a considerable amount of torque on the knees, particularly when it calls for turning of the waist 90 degrees while keeping the feet pointed forward. My knees hurt a bit after completing the exercise. It was hard to understand what the author was saying in the video, possibly due to his foreign accent.

Conclusion: The DVD is more of a demonstration video, rather than a true instructional video.

Note: There was no instruction insert with the DVD",1386115200,2,1193,4.671428571428572
8324403,5,B000E0EE3U,"I rarely leave feedback for the items, but I have to comment on Black Lotus DVD. I bought CDs of Controlled Meditative Training (which I like a lot) from the same author and I've got curious about Black Lotus Technique. I have to tell that learning the technique was really easy and fun. The whole complex takes very little time to do and gives me energy, balance and inner peace instantly. I recommend this DVD to every one who likes getting such results quick and easy.",1206921600,8,471,4.488372093023256
8324404,5,B000E0EE3U,"This DVD is by far the best product about dynamic meditation on the market.  It opens a new world of a combination of physical movement and meditation with ease and grace. It is surprisingly simple to follow and then do it yourself.  It also gave me an esthetic pleasure to watch the author do it and a challenge to emulate it. It has become an every day necessity to go through the Black Lotus cycle, the energizing and uplifting results are worth experiencing.",1136073600,16,462,4.554216867469879
