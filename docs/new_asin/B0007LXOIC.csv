8048569,5,B0007LXOIC,"Well, I love the Yu Yu Hakusho series, and I felt compelled to rate this DVD because its the first time since the Dark Tournament that I felt the same kind of excitement when I opened and watched this one.

I wasn't disappointed. The story was strong, new and exciting characters were introduced (as well as old ones) and there was a good amount of action!

In Every Demon For Himself, Yusuke, visits Yomi and proposes a tournament with all demons of Demonworld to decide the ruler of Demonworld. In the second half of the episode, we are introduced to a whole new gamut of characters who will be involved in the Demonworld Tournament, including Yomi's Son.

In The Preliminaries, the tournament begins.  Action galore with old faces and new alike battling for their lives in the tournament.

In The Battle of Father and Son, Yomi faces off against his son in round 1. Its a great match, and you get to see a lot of Yomi's power as a fighter. If that isn't enough, you also get to see Yusuke square off in his round 2 fight.

So if you are a little tired watching episodes that more develop the storyline, and miss the non-stop action of the Dark Tournament, then this volume is for you.  I think the fighting action is only going to get better as the Demonworld Tournament continues...",1114041600,5,1286,4.493562231759657
