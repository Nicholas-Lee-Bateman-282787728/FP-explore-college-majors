It is ok, I will give it to someone who has a different player.",1507766400,,105,3.608695652173913
7874212,4,6304460805,I've never heard of this movie before. I liked Michael J. Fox from his Family Ties days. This looked like a funny and interesting movie to watch. Which it was by the way. I don't suggest buying this because this is not something you would watch more than once in my opinion. I think it would be better to rent it if you want to watch it. Still a good movie.,1158451200,,357,4.042253521126761
7874213,4,6304460805,"I'm amazed I'd never heard of this film before. I bought it because I love Michael J. Fox and it looked like a funny movie. I was very impressed by it! Even though it was obviously a TV movie (there are fades for commercials still intact) and it is pretty low budget in terms of any kind of stunts or special effects, it's really funny and sports a great cast. In addition to Fox, you've got Anthony Edwards, Crispin Glover, Jon Gries, and half a dozen more recognizable names. The movie itself is really funny. It's about a guy (Fox) who likes a girl (Nancy McKeon), but she's dating the self-proclaimed king of the school (Edwards). Edwards' character and his cronies really give Fox's character (and the other non-kings) a hard time. So it's up to the underdogs to prove that kings don't belong in high schools. It's a great movie about friendship and there's even a drag race for an added bit of high school movie fun. Despite its moments of cheesiness, this is a real treat and I'd definitely recommend it.",1030492800,17,1011,4.530054644808743

7874215,5,6304460805,"Back in the 1980s, NBC had the midas touch when it came to making TV movies with the top teen stars of the period. This was the first of many: High School USA. It's also amazing because at the time, the teens of the  cast were top stars:
Michael J. Fox (Family Ties) Nancy McKeon (The Facts  of Life) Todd Bridges (Diff'rent Strokes) Dana Plato (Diff'rent Strokes)  Crystal Bernard (Happy Days) Lauri Hendler (Gimme a Break) Cathy Silvers  (Happy Days)
Even some up and comers like Crispin Glover and Anthony  Edwards have notable roles. This wasn't only an 80s teenfest. It features  some of the teen actors of the 50s and 60s, all who made welcomed returns  to acting through this film. It has a funny plot and entangles many  subplots. If you are a fan of 80s teen flicks, then get this one. It's fun  to watch.",960422400,17,814,4.445945945945946
