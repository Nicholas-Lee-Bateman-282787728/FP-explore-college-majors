2325147,5,B0009VQ7N4,Easy half hour arm workout with quick results!  Tony is pretty funny.  The half hour goes quickly.,1217808000,4,98,4.705882352941177
2325148,4,B0009VQ7N4,"Great arm workout.  I like that instructions are given for the use of both weights and bands giving you multiple options.  If using weights, you will need multiple weights ranging in several sizes, or as Tony uses some of the adjustable weights.",1181779200,9,245,4.809523809523809

2325152,4,B0009VQ7N4,"Great DVD.  Much tamer than some of his other workouts. It works, if you do what it says, and watch your diet.  I like Tony Horton, & have other dvd's of his,(ie. ABS Burner, P90X & P90X2).",1417737600,,189,4.081081081081081
2325153,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Delivered before the delivery date, works great",1416355200,,47,5.857142857142857
2325154,3,B0009VQ7N4,The DVD is great quality; I just didn't care for the content so much.  Someone else might like it though.,1405036800,,105,4.25
2325155,1,B0009VQ7N4,I couldn't make it through this annoying workout with the goofiest instructor.  For sale on Ebay!!!!!  Avoid unless you like goofy instructors who talk a lot and take way too much time between different exercises.,1402704000,,213,5.057142857142857
2325156,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I have successfully lost and kept off 75 pounds after back surgery with Tony and crew!  I bought this to tone in between my Power 90 and Walking regimen.  It is fun, works well and is fast.  Just the thing to do on an ""off"" day.  It has helped dramatically in further toning my arms.  Worth it!",1400457600,,294,4.087719298245614
2325157,4,B0009VQ7N4,"Good workout I totally felt the burn in my arms after doing this workout, the only bad thing is that it doesn't really give u a cardio workout or anything",1395792000,,154,4.166666666666667
2325158,5,B0009VQ7N4,"It's a good no- frills basic stretch divided into three 10 minute segments. Do the whole half hour or just 10 minutes, depending on your schedule.",1393459200,,146,4.653846153846154
2325159,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I work out six times a week-Zumba, Spinning, & Sculpting Classes. I do this workout 2-3 times a week for 30 minutes and my muscles feel great. This workout combines yoga with stretching and muscles love the combination. The yoga poses chosen are not super difficult, and this can easily be done by beginners to intermediate. Tony Horton makes stretching fun.",1379980800,4,358,4.885245901639344
2325160,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I really enjoy this stretching DVD with tony Horton, this DVD has a 10 min power stretching warm-up, and then an additional 20 minutes of more intense stretches, but not too intense. He also shows beginner moves and advanced moves as well. What I really like is it is only a half hour, and the time flys by. I feel like I get a really good stretching routine from this DVD.",1372896000,4,373,4.267605633802817
2325161,4,B0009VQ7N4,"This is exactly what it sounds like, 30 minutes of stretching.  It was odd doing 30 minutes of just stretching the first time but it felt very good afterwards.  Like Tony, I think stretching is very important in a workout and active lifestyle.",1366243200,,243,4.627906976744186
2325162,5,B0009VQ7N4,I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to get back into toning.  I haven't had it long so I can't say if it works but I do know I'm sore the next day.,1363824000,,163,3.657142857142857
2325163,5,B0009VQ7N4,"this video has 2 options the first 10min you can easily do every day, then on the days you want the best stretch continue with the entire 30 min.. love it",1363219200,,154,4.0
2325164,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Excellent DVD. I had seen it before and wanted my own copy. There is a 10 minute segment which
is great if you don't have a lot of time, and a longer 20 minute segment. Highly recommended for a
great stretch.",1359158400,,208,4.097560975609756
2325165,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Really easy to follow for a newbie. I could do just about everything except the chair squat pushups. I will though! Lasts just the right length, Tony is funny! He gets his ""Arnold"" voice on, relatable and lighthearted. Good workout!",1358294400,2,232,4.825
2325166,5,B0009VQ7N4,"This is a wonderful tape as all Tony Horton's tapes are.  It is a great way to get limbered up before a workout or use this as a warm down also.  But do stretch before any workout.  This is my go to tape whenever I have a stressful day and just need to destress.  It keeps me limber and heart healthy.  Try this tape, you will not be dissapointed.",1357430400,3,347,3.971014492753623
2325167,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Great stretch program...I got it to replace the 1 hour 15 minute yoga workout in P90X.  It's not nearly as involved, but a great time-saver.",1356825600,,140,4.6
2325168,5,B0009VQ7N4,"My FAVORITE personal trainers are Mr. Horton, Tony Little, Bob Harper, Jillian Michaels, Gilad and Jackie Warner!
OMG, you get such an AWESOME workout with these guys! These individuals all get 5 stars!",1353974400,2,202,5.151515151515151
2325169,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Tony is one of THE nicest guys around! When I met him, I told him that PHH Stretch is my all-time favorite workout and he was pleasantly surprised to hear that because he said PHH is his favorite, too. Tony is one of the best motivators I have ever met. He is as real as he appears.

If you need a quick stretch to start or end your day, this is it. You can do it for 10 minutes alone or as a warm-up for other workouts, or you can continue on for the full 30 minutes. No special equipment is needed--I'd do the floor moves on my bed. As with all of Tony's videos, there are at least three people in each, performing varying levels of difficulty with each move (easy, moderate & challenging). The on-screen timer isn't obnoxious and you have the option to play it without their music.

I have a form of Muscular Dystrophy and have found that I can do all of the moves here. I can feel they have helped me and can see it in my range of motion. I've shown the DVD to my doctors and they are glad that I have found something that works for me.

I'd recommend any of Tony's workouts to anyone who'd ask but this one will always remain my favorite.",1349308800,9,1143,4.09375
2325170,4,B0009VQ7N4,Love the stretching. The stretching in this video doesn't feel like a chore. The time passes quickly. He shows great modifications as well.,1348012800,,139,5.086956521739131
2325171,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I have the entire Beachbody set.... I love it!  Very easy to do exercises, with excellent results.
My dog just ate my Arm Toner dvd, I'm desperately looking to find another, I enjoyed the workout so much.",1328486400,,204,4.513513513513513
2325172,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Mr Horton might look @ ease & these stretches may appear easy (as all the other ones he has) but if you're out of shape, he'll have you in shape quick. No bouncing but it's the best one he has to begin with. Any & all of Mr Horton's workout dvd's/tapes are fantastic & you WILL see quick results if you stick with it!",1324080000,3,317,3.96875
2325173,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I got this video extremely fast.  I was very pleased to see that it arrived as described, and I have not had any trouble with it.  This video is pretty awesome, it really works my arms out.",1317600000,,189,4.081081081081081
2325174,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I needed a stretching routine for the P90 Master Series plan.  My son's P90X session was too strenuous at my level.  The pre-exercise program stretches were too short.  Even though this is designed as part of the Half-hour exercise program, it fits in very well with the Master Series schedule for the Rest/Stretch day.  I'm even looking at adding it in during the middle of the week-long program schedule.  Well worth the money.",1306713600,8,429,4.821917808219178
2325175,5,B0009VQ7N4,This is a great DVD. The instructions are easy to follow. Tony is fun & down to earth. Great intro to doing any of his more advanced dvd's.,1304899200,2,139,4.0
2325176,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Good workout that completly targets your arm and shoulders, just add in some back and chest moves and your done with a complete upper body workout.",1292976000,,147,4.6923076923076925
2325177,5,B0009VQ7N4,"Tony has this down to a science!  This is just the right routine for the person who doesn't have very much time to get exercise during the week.
Tony and his posse go through the first twenty minutes of the routines rather quickly; then they take a little more time in the second set at more of a yoga pace for thirty minutes.
This is perfect for the person who doesn't have time for his P90X+ Total Body Plus, P90X+ Upper Plus - Abs/Core Plus or P90X DVD sets or is just starting out.",1277424000,5,485,4.159574468085107
2325178,4,B0009VQ7N4,I recommend the Power Half Hour Arm Toner DVD.  You can use either the arm bands or free weights. The workout flies by. You see great results after only using it a few times!,1224288000,8,174,4.117647058823529

8067526,5,B0009VQ7N4,"I love this DVD! The one I had bought years ago succumbed to the dreaded Open Up The DVD Case, Find It Empty Syndrome....I really missed it, so I bought another. Exercise shouldn't be over-thought. When you look at the exercise manuals of long ago, they were almost laughably simple, but they worked. No bells or whistles. I love this DVD for the same reason: simple but effective. A habit that I have as consistent as brushing my teeth every day...just the Power Half Stretch and I'm good to go.",1479168000,,496,4.522222222222222
