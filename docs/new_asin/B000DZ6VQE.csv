It is basically watching classes and does not break down technique. I suggest going to youtube to find breakdowns. Osu",1477699200,,269,4.510204081632653
8102833,3,B000DZ6VQE,Its mostly a video of a Kyokoshin Dojo at practice but it does have a good amount of drills when it comes to sparring for me it was very nostalgic as my sparring instructor used similar techniques in Tae Kwon Do,1428192000,3,211,4.170731707317073
8102834,4,B000DZ6VQE,"The video itself is much like watching a series of classes which provides a nice overview of the art, but not much instruction. The production quality isn't bad, but it's in PAL and that may be an issue for some. Overall, not a bad dvd but definately lacking in the instruction portion.",1295049600,,286,4.519230769230769
8102835,1,B000DZ6VQE,"watching the dvd is like viewing a class with little to no insight into the moves ,DVD is especially  poor in regards to kumite techniches. Big disapointment",1281484800,2,157,4.814814814814815
