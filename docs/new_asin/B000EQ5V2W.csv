8113237,3,B000EQ5V2W,Seller is not to blame. I thought I was getting a great price for the Disney movie and did not pay enough attention to the cover. I'm disappointed but it's not the seller's fault I was dumb.,1422144000,,190,4.162162162162162
8113238,5,B000EQ5V2W,I like this version of Aladdin because it is very special and unique. I also like it becuase it has a black guy in it considering that most of the old school animation films dosen't have black people in them. This version of Aladdin is better than the disney version if you ask me. I grew up watching this cool version of Aladdin. I'm glad that this version of Aladdin has made it to dvd.,1283731200,,388,4.1866666666666665
