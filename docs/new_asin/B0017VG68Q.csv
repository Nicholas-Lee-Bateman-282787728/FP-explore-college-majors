3175673,5,B0017VG68Q,This was a great movie-we knew that we were going to be in the car for about 13 hrs-so I was looking for new things for our 2 1/2 yr old.  This did the trick-kept him entertained for quite a while.,1375833600,,197,3.8048780487804876

3175675,5,B0017VG68Q,"By chance, I saw an episode of Back at the Barnyard and thought it to be entertainingly funny!  I ordered--and received it.  It's great to be able to watch and laugh at the antics of the delightful characters.  I have recommended it to others who just want to see something fun, clean, and great to watch with the whole family.",1366156800,,327,4.416666666666667
3175676,5,B0017VG68Q,I love this movie it is funny I could watch it all the time if I had time I like it because it is funny,1363737600,,103,3.16
3175677,4,B0017VG68Q,"This item was very funny, and it is a good pick for grand children of any age. I bought it for my ex-. He thought it was a good deal.",1362787200,,133,3.466666666666667
3175678,5,B0017VG68Q,The Grandsons really enjoyed this movie. It is in their collection of favorite movies. The video is worth the money.,1357689600,,116,4.85
3175689,5,B0017VG68Q,"Barnyard was an awesome move and these 8 episodes are no different! These episode set is fun to watch for both toddlers and parents too! A home run for those long road trips or just hanging around at the house. I have to say that as an adult I do not mind spending a few moments clutching my ever growing 23 month old son while he enjoys his little movie... LOL, I get the pleasure of enjoying a very funny DVD series plus (more importantly) I get a reason to ""STOP and enjoy the roses"".... the time spent with my son is worth every penny. Great DVD... and great opportunity to just hold your little one!

Five stars for good entertainment for our baby boy... plus a bonus star for allowing us to slow him down for a little parent and baby time!

I hope this simple review helps! Good luck!",1354752000,,790,4.225165562913907
3175690,3,B0017VG68Q,But it's just a collection of episodes from Season 1. It's my Fault for not reading the fine print. The show is very cute though. My 16 month old and my 8 year old both enjoy watching the show. Great for car rides!,1353196800,,214,4.0
3175691,5,B0017VG68Q,This DVD is a great one to have for younger children especially from age 3-6 years old. The animals take on human characteristics and behaviors as they go about doing their fun and sometimes silly activities as they try to avoid letting the farmer and his nosey neighbors discover what they are up to. The humor is such that young children can understand it and let's face it children at a young age love silly things especially talking barnyard animals. One of the great things about this DVD that is about 90 minutes long is that it is divided up into episodes that are about 10-12 minutes long each so its great to use with young children as a reward or short entertainment. Don't be surprised if the adults in your home sneak a peek at what all these amusing and unconventional barnyard animals are up to in their carefree capers on the farm when no one is supposedly looking. Great fun!,1348704000,,891,4.506172839506172
3175692,5,B0017VG68Q,"Grandson loves this movie, already wore one out. Lots of music and movement in the animals. Lots of color, Has some parts may be scary to sheltered children.",1322265600,,157,4.642857142857143

3175696,4,B0017VG68Q,"My twin 10-year-old boys love Barnyard, so if it makes them happy, I'm happy. Their favorite character is Snotty-boy, but this series needs to release more TV-episode DVDs, as this character is not particularly featured here. My big problem is male cows with disturbing, fleshy udders.",1233446400,,285,5.217391304347826

3175698,5,B0017VG68Q,"I absolutely LOVE these barnyard critters--and the human ones as well! The humor is very obviously aimed at adults and is--in a word--FUNNY. On any given episode I can always count on nearly falling out of my seat laughing at least once or twice.  I loved the full-length movie so much I went right out and bought this DVD containing episodes from the TV series.  My only complaint is that there are only 8 of them -- here's hoping they'll release more episodes in the near future.  A very clever, witty, and thoroughly enjoyable show.  Kudos to both the writers and the actors on this one -- these guys are HILARIOUS.",1228780800,11,618,4.54054054054054
