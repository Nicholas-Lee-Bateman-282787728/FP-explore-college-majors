7029205,2,B00U4ZYHBE,Poor quality pixelated copy. If anyone knows how to to get a legit DVD let me know.,1454284800,,83,3.9411764705882355
7029206,5,B00U4ZYHBE,"This is an excellent series that people of all ages can enjoy. There have been some English language episodes created, but in all honesty it is better in Russian (and I don't speak Russian). Most of the cartoon is visual and you don't need to understand the language to understand what is happening or in general what is being said. This DVD works on American players (Zone 1, NTSC). The menu is only in Russian, but there are only two options: play all and choose episode. With so many episodes offered, I'd recommend this DVD over others I've seen on offer.",1447804800,3,559,4.544554455445544
7029207,4,B00U4ZYHBE,"I like high energy little girls.  Expecially when I can't luldlnerstand what is being said.  This is a series of epiosodes of a lettle girl and her friend, a bear.  This is totally from Russia with no english sub titles.  This s a charming, set of five minute episodes.  You'll like Masha's giggle.",1444262400,,298,4.547169811320755

7029213,5,B00U4ZYHBE,"THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT FOR CHILDREN (and adults)!! My toddler LOVES it! Considering all the violence that children watch daily in so many cartoons, this is a breath of fresh air. Actually, this is what children are supposed to watch. This is the kind of cartoons that my generation grew up with (`70s/`80s). I was so happy to find this!",1428364800,2,336,4.711864406779661

It's fun, funny, pretty, and has a story that doesn't need words in perfect order. It flows naturally and entertains children and adults.",1458691200,2,355,4.298507462686567
