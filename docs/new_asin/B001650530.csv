3151970,5,B001650530,"I have a large collection of National Parks. This is the best one I have seen. The time lapse photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent. I  would prefer that the narrative be deleted. Do mountains have a soul?  In my humble opinion, souls are imaginary in humans ( ask your doctor where your soul can be found) and as for mountains, forget about it (ask your favorite geologist).",1385596800,,394,4.614285714285714
3151971,5,B001650530,"I have been lucky enough to visit and stay at many of the National Parks for years but I have never experienced the National Parks from the angle that this IMAX documentary is shot. Patrick O'Hearn is just the right music for this IMAX documentary as well since not too many musicians have been able to give me the joy of music as much as Patrick has in the National Parks, by just laying down and looking at millions of the stars in the sky after a long day of hike after a fine outdoor dinning with loved ones. What a privilege to live in North America and be able to visit such unbelievable places and knowing that no one can take those away from anyone of us for years to come... Bravo, bravo, bravo. An absolute feast for a healthy mind.",1368835200,4,742,4.232394366197183

Good:
Obviously, it's about national parks, and contains really impressive footage, well chosen and thought-out shots.
Most footage is high-definition. Time-lapse effect (everything is sped-up) is nicely used to improve dynamics or point out changes occuring in nature.

Bad:
There are absolutely no sounds from nature - entire presentation is drowned in background music (of acceptable quality, though) and narration.
There are no animals and insects visible (except some unrecognizable, small dark birds in background), which somehow makes the whole film look empty and unnatural. I get that not everyone likes spiders or snakes, including myself... but weren't there any ladybugs or butterflies? Wild cats? Squirrels? What about endangered species like wolves? In all the national parks of all the north America, there is not a single animal worth mentioning and filming?
Narration is less than impressive consisting mostly of empty phrases like ""timeless beauty inspires spirit to be spiritually spiritual"". Nothing is said about geology, botanics, climate, why do these factors combine at these places in such ways to make them so attractive and colorful. It is said, though, that ""Death Valley is a desert and has a desert climate... Mount Rainier is a mountain and has a mountain climate... rain forest gets lots of rain"".
There is a mysterious fade to black transition every few minutes for no particular reason (except to insert commercials, I suppose, if this material is sold to someone interested adding them).

Ugly:
Some scenes are shot with standard-definition camera, the difference is really noticable, for the worse. Some scenes are shot with unknown-definition camera which is badly out of focus.
Some high-definition shots are made with camera with dirty lenses and the dirt is there through several shots. Not the little drops or water or something that can be accepted as ""part of nature""... just some irregular dirt, fingerprints or something...
Some shots are made with 24 fps and poorly, causing bad stuttering, ""upscaled"" to 30 fps.
Something strange happened in editing process, so at the left side there is about 1 inch of empty black space. The width of black bar is not constant throughout the film.
Some scenes have weird pink stripe at bottom, looking as malfunctioning camera.",1244764800,9,2364,5.281914893617022
