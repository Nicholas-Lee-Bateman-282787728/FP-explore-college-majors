8671231,5,B00MAS0974,"Love this movie, I'm a coach and Tony and I trained with IPEC Coaching school at the same time. He was assigned to me as my practice client so we could both build up coaching hours. Holy crap! Did I learn a lot!  Tony's stories of his life were utterly fascinating. He's a wonderful guy, the things he has done are amazing, this movie gives a very nice telling of his story and the story of transgender people. He may have been born female but there is no doubt that he's a man. You cannot watch this movie and not see that somewhere a mistake has been made with all the people in the movie. You get to visit and sit in on the transgender group that Tony started, you get to hear their stories as well, hear their pain. Then you get to visit with the parents group that Tony started. This group got started because the parents would come in to bring their kids to the youth group and they had nothing else to do while the kids met. You also get to visit with the art group that Tony started for younger trans kids.
What you come away with is a great feeling for the difficulty that transgender people face, a great respect for Tony Ferraiolo and what he's achieved and you will also forever change how you react when someone says ""yes, I was born with a vagina but I'm a man!""
Tony is the real deal and this is an excellent telling of his story and the story of transgender people everywhere.",1432512000,2,1392,4.213483146067416
