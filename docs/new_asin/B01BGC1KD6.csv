8750059,5,B01BGC1KD6,"If you enjoyed the manga then you'll like this as well. It follows the manga pretty close with some minor changes which is to be expected with any live action adaptation. Not really sure if this is an ""official"" DVD or a bootleg as is pretty common. Either way I'm not complaining as the quality is excellent. The subs are not perfect but they are pretty good. Since an official US release is probably a ways off (if we even get one) this one is well worth picking up.",1497225600,,468,4.269662921348314
