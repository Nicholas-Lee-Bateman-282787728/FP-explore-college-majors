7786281,5,B01HE8SHSW,"PLOT...
Following the outbreak of a parasitic virus that wipes out the majority of the human population, Emma and her sister Stacey find themselves separated from their parents as it reaches their neighbourhood. Quarantined with no connections to her family Emma with the help of her love interest Evan fights to protect her infected sister and for her own survival.

This is another one of the years best horror releases, a little gem that could be easily overlooked. This movie has a great story that builds up really well with plenty of tension, the cast is great and we have characters here that you can actually start to like, the horror element is cleverly woven into the drama of a girl trying to protect her sister and survive, its not a gore movie but it has its bloody moments and some freaky effects from the results of the virus in different hosts, this is a great budget movie too for what it is, I personally loved every second and came away satisfied I would certainly watch it again.

7786284,4,B01HE8SHSW,"Viral offers a few new takes on the virus/zombie genre and it clings to the usual template, as well.  The script, the acting and special effects are well above the typical movie of this type.  Sofia Black-D'elia and Annaleigh Tipton deliver great performances as the sisters at the center of the action (the males in the film have much less depth- the philandering father and stereotypical high school idiots) and there's a love story that turns out bittersweet, well, more sweet, at the conclusion.  The disease actually has biological science behind it.  If you've ever seen the factual cable series The Monsters Inside Me, you'll be a step up. In short, a very well-made film that you'd be happy to have in your collection, especially if you're a horror aficionado.",1476057600,2,768,4.884615384615385

7786286,5,B01HE8SHSW,"This wasn't your usual screaming teens or blood and guts horror. The plot was frightening and the acting was above average. It was something that you hope never happens. A  form of parasites infects large populations, turning them into monster like killers. This might sound like the same ole type of horror, but it isn't.  As it rapidly spreads, martial law is in effect and two sisters are involved. The movie, in my opinion, is good enough to get attention.",1471478400,2,460,4.7375

7786289,4,B01HE8SHSW,"The film starts out with an oriental virus and then shifts to the school world of Stacey (Analeigh Tipton) and her sister Emma (Sofia Black-D'Elia). Mom and Dad are out of town when the CDC quarantine sets in and the area goes under marshal law. The sisters stick together through thick and thin.

The acting was acceptable with a decent story line and good special effects in that one scene, however the film was weighed down with a lot of no action scenes. Do not read IMDB description unless you want a plot spoiler.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.  3 1/2 stars",1469404800,6,566,4.475728155339806
