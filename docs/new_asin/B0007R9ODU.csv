8050937,1,B0007R9ODU,This is the worst training DVD I've ever seen. The presentations were clumsy and apparently unscripted. I watched the presenter attempt the same step four times before realizing that the result was already on screen. One of my children could have done a better job. It was so painful to watch that I couldn't even finish it.,1259971200,,324,4.701754385964913
8050938,1,B0007R9ODU,"this is probably the worst teacher i have seen, the guy is boring his way in presenting subjects are non-educational. for example he gives you one long verbal explanation of the asp.net enginee, how it works with the isapi filter and he just goes on and on.

It dvd is really not worth buying.",1127779200,2,293,4.425925925925926
8050939,1,B0007R9ODU,"While some of the information offered good basics, most of the content of this video did not offer much at all.

What I liked about the video:

It's on DVD.

Provided an introduction to the topics discussed in the chapters.

Offered basic concepts about what Sharepoint and Sharepoint Portal Servies is and how they interact.

What I didn't like about the video:

Presenter was boring.

The audio is terrible and inconsistent in volume.

The video quality was a bit blurry when viewed on a PC.

THe music was horrible.  ""Digital Juice"" should be banned from making music.

The guy who so-called Mastered the DVD should be out of a job.

I felt that all of the segments that showed the code-behind file and creating custom webarts and event handling should really have been left out.  Those topics are too indepth to be shown in this presentation.  This DVD should've stuck with understanding how to build a site using Windows Sharepoint Services and Sharepoint Portal Services 2003.  That would've been a better method for this DVD.

I'm currently reading a book about Sharepoint Services Product Technologies and I thought the DVD would be a good supplementary to it.  But, as much as the book provides overwhelming detail on the system, the DVD provides overwhelming boredom and incoherent topic presentation.

So, do yourself a favor, search for a better DVD, or buy a good book.",1124236800,6,1382,4.858369098712446
