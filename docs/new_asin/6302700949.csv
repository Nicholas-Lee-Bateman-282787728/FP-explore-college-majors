498450,5,6302700949,"My history teacher originally reccommended this movie to me, and, confidentially, I was a bit skeptical. My father said he had seen it before and also thought it was wonderful, but I still wasn't sure. So one day, I  watched this movie on AMC, and, believe me, I am now in agreement with my  teacher and Dad!! Every single time it is on TV I watch it, even though I  already have it on tape. Just recently I saw the Douglas Fairbanks version,  and I must say that while I didn't feel it was better, and I did not feel  it was worse either, I thought it was much funnier. Fairbanks has you in  stitches while he's running around in his Zorro costume, jumping over  things and throwing food at people. If you haven't seen the Tyrone Powers  version, go rent it immediately!! If you haven't seen the silent version,  see that now, too!! (Don't let the quality of the silent one discourage  you. In the one I saw, the film was constantly going from blindingly light  to almost pitch black. Even so, it is one of the funniest movies I have  ever seen.)

Tyrone Power is perfect as Zorro with those lovely speaking eyes and wonderful sword play.  And Basil Rathbone is  the type of villian that you love to hate.  Throw in Linda Darnell as  Zorro's love interest and the you have a great movie.  The humor is what  holds it altogether and makes you want to watch it again and again.  Diego  making his father a little bit crazy and the govenor a nervous wreck.  I  didn't think that they made movies like this anymore until I saw the Mask  of Zorro.  Not a remake, thank heaven, but with the same spirit and fire as  this one.  As far as I am concerned Zorro can ride forever and I will watch  faithfully.",923875200,,757,4.075342465753424

498526,5,6302700949,"This classic Hollywood film, ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940), takes place in the 1820s California territory among Spanish noblemen.

The hero, Diego (played by Tyrone Power), pretends to be a spoiled wimp by day. At night, Diego wears a mask so that ""Zorro,"" the expert swordfighter, can avenge the local villagers.

Features an epic swordfight between Zorro and the bad guy (played by Basil Rathbone).

The secondary storyline is a sweet romance: the dashing hero gets the beautiful girl.

Great adventure-movie soundtrack, too.

And I was not disappointed. Power brings such a great depth to the film, playing the three sides of Diego De la Vega: the chivalrous gentleman, the lazy fop (a well-thought-out disguise to throw off suspicion), and of course the dashing Zorro. This film also has one of the best sword fights in cinematic history, between Power's De la Vega and Basil Rathbone's villainous Captain. I even think it's better than Rathbone's duel with Errol Flynn in Robin Hood.

This is Hollywood swashbuckling at its finest.  Power is excellent not only as the dashing, heroic Zorro, but also very amusing when he puts on foppish airs to make everyone believe that Don Diego is an insignificant dandy.

Power - in a double leading role - is at his best as Zorro, climbing, jumping, riding and fencing, determined to finish with tyranny and oppression by terrorizing, and retrieving taxation funds and by challenging a cunning officer, proving in public his indifference, his ostentation and irony as a perfect pacifist fop in 19th-Century Spanish California, confusing and deceiving his aristocratic father Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), the deposed Alcalde...

The inspired casting (in supporting roles) recalls ""The Adventures of Robin Hood.""

Linda Darnell is the pretty Lolita, Quintero's charming niece, who loves the mysterious hero and can't tolerate the fop until she is told that they are the image of the same person...

Basil Rathbone, one of the most durable of screen villains who has mastered stage fencing but never won a Swordfight, plays the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale, the Alcalde's military adviser... He is a second-rate soldier of fortune who leads the campaign of frustrating taxation, who considered Diego ""a fancy clown"" but who suggests a practical plan, an alliance for the good of the state...

(Note that this review is for the DVD distributed by Fox Home Entertainment and released in March 2004)

This movie, based on the story ""The Curse of Capistrano,"" is about the son of a Californian nobleman (Tyrone Power) coming home in the 1820s from Madrid, Spain to find his father's land (the father is played by Montague Love) under a villainous dictatorship (the dictator is played by J.E. Bromberg with his assistant being played by Basil Rathbone).  On the one hand he plays the foolish, vain aristocrat, while on the other he's the masked avenger Zorro (Tyrone Power again).  He, as the disguised Zorro, works to restore his father to power and return tax money stolen by the dictator.  As if this is not enough, he even finds time to romance the ruling tyrant's niece (Linda Darnell).

This movie reminded me of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" but without Errol Flynn and the lush, colorful background of Sherwood Forest.  Not only is the storyline (as described above) similar but there are even some of the same actors.  I've already mentioned Basil Rathbone (perhaps most famous for playing ""Sherlock Holmes"") who again plays a similar role as a villain but there's also Eugene Pallette who also plays a similar but expanded role as a friar.  As in ""Robin Hood"", there is a thrilling sword duel between our hero (but in his nobleman duds) and the tyrant's assistant.  (Note that this duel is not as thrilling as the one in ""Robin Hood."")

I found both the cinematography and the musical score quite well done.  The acting especially by Tyrone Power is very good.  I felt that Tyrone Power did not appear often enough as Zorro.

This movie is sometimes slow and lacks energy in places.  I also found that the black and white gave the movie an unintentional claustrophobic feeling.

Finally, the transfer to DVD could have been better but I found it acceptable.  There are two extras on this DVD that I found interesting.

In conclusion, an exciting classic has been restored to DVD.  Be sure to see this movie and learn the true story of Zorro!!

I had never seen a Tyrone Power movie before, but I have to say that starting today I've become a fan.  Tyrone Power gives a sumptuous performance as Zorro.  The movie will keep you interested all along, and the whole cast is one of talented actors.  Better than ""The Mask of Zorro"" with Antonio Banderas, I recommend this movie to any Zorro fan.",1110067200,7,438,4.304878048780488
498791,5,6302700949,"I haven't seen the Douglas Fairbanks version but I do prefer this to ""Mask of Zorro"".

I think I was maybe 13 when I first watched this movie on TCM because my dad was watching it and I was oddly captivated, and now I'm 21 and I still feel the same way.  Sure the dialogue is overwhelmingly cheesy, to the point I'm not sure many people I know would like the movie.  ""Lovlier than a morning in June"" is an especially awful line.  It is ridiculous, empty flattery at best, and not even a compliment at worst, considering that June weather isn't exactly known as the lovliest, at least in CA.  But any time Don Diego is acting his role pretty much makes up for it.  Cheasy with a purpose!  The action scenes are great, especially all the horse chase and sword fight scenes.  I suppose it is my favorite sword fight scene that doesn't begin with both participants fighting left-handed.  Any scenes where Tyrone Power is switching personas are very well-acted, with my favorite being where he tells the priest the truth.  I also love Errol Flynn and Robin Hood esepcially, but I think I like this one better, and I find it to be more re-watchable.

Now it is true that the quality isn't great, and the special features aren't spectacular, but it is priced accordingly, so no matter.  It's like renting it twice!",1109894400,3,1307,4.491525423728813

There's the eye-pleasing art direction (and Linda Darnell!) and scintillating performances especially from Basil Rathbone.

The transfer is adequate, you'll see better than this with other films released directly through the original studio though.

And dialogue laced with wit and humor as well as drama.  Now THIS is what a Hollywood action movie should be!
This is one of the all-time best.  Got the blues?  This ought to chase them right away.  Really got the blues?  Try a double-feature of this with Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood.

498795,4,6302700949,"This is arguably the best film version of Johnston McCulley's costumed swordfighter of old California, beating out both the 1920s Douglas Fairbanks film and the recent Banderas/Hopkins blockbuster (although both are good films in their own rights).
What this film has is Golden Age Hollywood style in spades: glamourous photography, music, and star power. It has less action than you might expect, and Tyrone Power actually spends very little time in the Zorro costume -- he's in his 'civilian' duds for the whole finale. But the film is such good-natured fun and director Mamoulian has such a solid handle on the material that it hardly matters. The romance and comedy are also well executed and finely balanced with the physical action.
Speaking of action, the big duel between Tyrone Power and Basil Rathbone is a stunner, an amazing piece of combat choreography. As a bonus, Fox Home Video has mixed the film in stereo; very rare for a film of the period. The disc also has a 45 minute episode of ""Biography"" about Tyrone Power. It spends only a minute on THE MARK OF ZORRO, but it does show a priceless outtake of Power dressed in the Zorro costume making fun of studio boss Darryl Zanuck. Even if you don't watch the whole documentary, make sure you speed through it to catch this riotous old Hollywood prank.",1075248000,135,1315,4.797356828193832
498796,4,6302700949,"I just bought the DVD thinking it would have been digitally restored or duped from a good print or negative. Sadly, no. There are too many scratches for a state of the art digital DVD. Shame on the producers for not taking the effort to find a better print to work from, or to use computer technology to clean it up. I may miss my guess, but I believe that I have a VHS version that is cleaner than the DVD. That said, this is a classic to have. It moves at a fast pace with no wasted dialogue. Power gives a fine performance as do all the characters, such as Bromberg and Rathbone, with a twinkle of humor. The Darryl Zanuck joke on the extras is fun to see. Shickel commentary is kind of humdrum, and when he introduces Darnell, at her loveliest, as the ""daughter"" I felt hmm Richard you lost me already (she is the niece). I still await a better technical quality version on DVD. For now this will do. Zorro theme was actually done by Hugo Friedhofer,not Alfred Newman.",1069459200,10,972,4.288043478260869
498797,4,6302700949,"For close on to a century now, the mysterious character Zorro has proved a major touchstone to 20th (and now 21st) century storytelling. From early pulp magazine adventures, on up through the early silent years of motion pictures (re: Douglas Fairbanks), then into the serials of the 1930's, the ""A"" list production of the 1940s (the subject of this review), the Walt Disney television series of the late 1950s with Guy Williams and its enormously popular Dell Publishing comic book companion series drawn by the legendary illustrator Alex Toth, a tv cartoon series, and, most recently,  an ""A"" list revival with ""The Mask Of Zorro"", starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas.
  And along the way, what else has El Zorro accomplished besides being enormously popular? Well, for one thing he became known as the FIRST ""super-hero"" with a SECRET IDENTITY. Whatever you call yourself now : Matt Murdock, Peter Parker, Clark Kent,Diana Prince...WHATEVER...you owe your secret identity and crime fighter personas to Don Diego and Zorro, so many years ago. The late Bob Kane always freely admitted that Batman (and Bruce Wayne) derived DIRECTLY from ""The Mark of Zorro"" with Tyrone Power.
  So does someone else, though his own ""secret identity""(John Reid) got dropped...or rather, buried...early on. The Lone Ranger. The mysterious masked man was lifted from Zorro. Even more interestingly, when George Trendle was casting his Lone Ranger t.v. show in 1949 he got most interested in..and eventually hired for the part...Clayton Moore, whom he was impressed with when seen in the title role of a Republic serial.
The name of the serial? ""The Ghost of Zorro"".
  So, friends, this Z-Man is an ENORMOUS cultural icon. If you have seen him in the person of Antonio Banderas you have seen a good, VERY acceptable version of him. But friend, neither Banderas...nor Guy Williams...nor Douglas Fairbanks...can TOUCH Tyrone Power in this, the greatest of all Zorro screen incarnations. This is ""IT"". The picture quality isn't perfect, and the ""extras"" on the DVD are pretty lame, but THIS Zorro movie is THE Zorro movie.
  Here you get Basil Rathbone Vs. Power with blades. Power was a good fencer, but Rathbone was Hollywood's greatest. When you wanted a super swordfight in classic Hollywood you got Rathbone. He dueled Flynn in Captain Blood and Robin Hood, and Power in Zorro. Lost EVERY TIME but made it look good. Made it look GREAT!
  You also see things here that mark changes in the appearance of the character. The mask is used either as an eye mask or a bandanna. Also the cape/cloak is NOT used with the black outfit, ever (impedes sword fighting maneuverability). The cloak is worn only OVER ""civilian"" clothes when a quick-change is necessary.
The cape/cloak worn WITH the black clothing appears for the first time in the Walt Disney t.v. series and is used solely for visual effect. This wardrobe combination, however, has seemingly become standard now and is used again in the newer Banderas ""Mask"" product as well.
  You have no mute (and pretending to be deaf) servant ""Bernardo"" here...another Disney late addition..and no secret cavern hideaway. This is bare-bones Zorro, free from elaborate trappings. But this movie moves with verve and panache and humour and cinematic savvy, and doesn't need the elaborate trappings layered on later by others.
  So saddle up your own stallion, test your foil with a whipping  swish through the air, and ride out into the night (...when the full moon is bright) with the horseman known as Zorro. Cut some Zees. You'll be glad you did.",1068595200,8,3580,5.02195945945946
498798,1,6302700949,"This is the worst transfer to dvd that I've ever seen.  My vhs copy from TCM is much better!  I love the film, but was bitterly disappointed at the shoddy treatment.  Shame!!!",1065916800,13,175,4.40625
498867,3,6302700949,"I've got no complaints about the film itself or the supplementary material (Tyrone Power bio and commentary during the film), but the transfer itself is mediocre. There seems to be a lot of flickering (due to compression artifacts?) -- for example, in the grill at the back of the room from 3:31-3:37 and in the metallic ""decorations"" on the soldiers' chests from 4:34-4:43. Fox didn't seem to have the same problems with The Song of Bernadette, another B&W movie which is almost 60% longer than this one.",1065657600,5,505,4.816091954022989
498868,5,6302700949,Tyrone Power plays Zorro...the liberator of early California from Spain. Excellent swashbuckling action. Co-starring Basil Rathbone.,1065484800,,132,7.3125
498869,2,6302700949,"""The Mark of Zorro"" is the most memorable of the Zorro films made about the black masked crusader, fighting for the people and against the injustices of corrupt political officials.  Zorro (Tyrone Power) must stop Captain Pasquale (Basil Rathbone) from destroying Los Angeles by robbing its citizenry while he romances his gorgeous niece (Linda Darnell).
TRANSFER: Just awful!  Though the original elements were in pretty bad shape, Fox has managed to restore much of the luster of the original camera negative.  There are age related artifacts, but the real problem here is the edge enhancement and aliasing and shimmering of fine details that are present in EVERY SINGLE FRAME of this disc! The audio is remastered in stereo and nicely presented for its age.
EXTRAS: Only a bio on Tyrone Power and an audio commentary by Richard Schickel.
BOTTOM LINE: A thrilling story and wonderful performances ruined by a shoddy transfer.  NO to ""The Mark of Zorro"".",1065484800,6,955,5.063694267515924
498870,5,6302700949,"""The Mark of Zorro"" is in many ways Twentieth Century-Fox's answer to Warners long string of swashbucklers and, in particular, Errol Flynn--and a magnificent answer it is.  The film never lags in its story of the masked avenger by night and stylish coward by day.  Power was in top form in this rousing and exciting film that makes mincemeat of ""The Mask of Zorro"" and any other film using Zorro as a main character--especially the foreign films like ""Three Swords of Zorro"" in the 1960s.
  Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell make a wonderful on-screen couple with their dance in front of her aunt and uncle a highlight of the film.  The music moves and the theme of the film will haunt any lover of film music.  The side players are also perfect.
  In short, as these great film adventures come to DVD, it is great to see that Mr. Power, Ms. Darnell, the villanous Mr. Rathbone, and many of the others will be among them.  Now,please, oh please DVD gods, bring on ""Captain Blood"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" and allow this viewer to die a happy man!!!!!",1065484800,4,1041,4.524064171122995
498871,5,6302700949,"I have been waiting forever for them to release this fantastic film on DVD! Zorro has been called the Robin Hood of the old West and this film was equally as good as the version of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn. It never follows the story line of the original story fairly well, but it captured the essence of the story while making the appropriate changes due to film time constraints. Tyrone Power was the perfect choice for the role as he was equally at home playing the fop or the adventurer with the romantic flair! Linda Darnell was a dream and the supporting cast was excellent in all ways. Eugene Pallette seemed to enjoy playing friars since he was one in both Zorro and Robin Hood. I am really hoping that they do a good job of cleaning up the movie for DVD. Especially the soundtrack, as the music plays a huge role in the romance and adventure. Thanks to whoever decided to put this out on DVD. I can't wait!!!",1045699200,5,924,4.377906976744186
498872,5,6302700949,"I'd rate Zorro just a notch below Flynn's Robin Hood, but just barely.  This is a wonderful swashbuckler, featuring Tyronne Power as Zorro/Don Diego.  He is magnificent in both roles... handsome, athletic, all that you could ask for.  Basil Rathbone is the perfect villian, just as he was in Robin Hood, as Captain Pasquale.  Little is usually said about Zorro's romantic interest, Linda Darnell, but she was sure gorgeous!  And the padre is the same man who played Friar Tuck in Robin Hood... terrific.  The music was perfect, the sword fight at the end was a masterpiece, everything was terrific.
As much as I liked Power in this role, I liked him even more in ""The Long Gray Line"".  Power also served honorably and with distinction in battle during World War II... another reason to like him.",1042761600,2,795,4.759124087591241

498874,4,6302700949,"exclaims Basil Rathbone when he gets a peek into all the loot that's in the coffers he's stealing from Father Eugene Pallette. But of course what he doesn't know is that it was all just put in there by Zorro aka Tyrone Power. ""The Mark of Zorro"" is a very entertaining romp in old California, when the Spanish nobles still had a lot of sway. Basil Rathbone is simply wonderful as the fencing master who takes an instant dislike to Diego, Tyrone Power's true identity. That's because Gale Sondergaard, heretofore Rathbone's mistress, is now casting glances at Power, who is pretending to be something of a sissy. This is disgusting to senorita Linda Darnell, who respects a Real Hombre, like Zorro. Power is drawn to her, not Sondergaard, but romance has to take a second seat to righting some wrongs. Really great duelling scenes, and some pretty advanced dialogue about an analogy between fruit and Diego make for a picture worth seeing.",997920000,,938,4.796296296296297
498875,5,6302700949,"This remarkable film (loosely based on the Zorro stories of Johnston McCulley) has everything one could ask for from a swashbuckling adventure story . . . excellent acting, a wonderful script and the inspired direction of Ruben Mamoulian.  Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, and Basil Rathbone are outstanding as the exciting hero, his true love, and the deliciously evil Captain Esteban Pasquale.  An inspired supporting cast including J. Edward Bromberg, Eugene Pallette, Gale Sondergaard, and Montagu Love convinces you that this is California of the 1820's.  Excellent pacing moves the story forward from adventure to adventure, finally culminating in that magnificent duel between Power and Rathbone, between justice and tyranny.  The clever use of humor, and the innocent yet passionate love that grows steadily between Power and Darnell (the Villain's niece), adds dimension to the characters and makes us care about them.  This is a film that deserves to be seen again and again!",996364800,7,981,5.38562091503268

7829836,5,6302700949,"Tyrone Power was a superstar from the mid-1930s to the late 1950s when he suffered a fatal heart attack during a fencing scene for a film he was producing.

This version of Zorro demonstrates that he was one of the finest fencers of his time having studied swordplay from his youth. Some people said he was the best and others said Basil Rathbone was the best, so in this film we see two masters attempting to 'kill' each other.  Another film that demonstrates his extraordinary skills is The Mississippi Gambler"" that was made when he was 36 or 37. The fencing in it excellent.

This second version of Zorro begins in Spain at a military academy. The only son of a rich Californian is called home before his graduation and quickly begins deceiving almost everyone he meets in order to correct various wrongs. He portrays the gay blade as an eloquent fop to the disgust family and friends, while - in one way or another - disarming the rest of society. As the night begins, so does his crusading.

The film is in glorious black and white; it is exciting, funny, adventurous, and highly entertaining. The special edition copy is very well done and I am glad that I bought it. I highly recommended the film for the extras about Tyrone and the commentary that provides many interesting insights to the very famous director in charge of the production that was beautifully shot.",1508112000,2,1374,4.6419753086419755
