8611144,5,B00F0N7Q1S,"I ordered this one first, instead of the set to make sure it would play in my region.  I was pleased to see that it was region free!  The content is incredible and they used the best technology to make this a 3D documentary. The feature about the making of the video was well worth watching too.",1423440000,2,295,4.157894736842105
8611145,4,B00F0N7Q1S,Excellent and very informativr. I had been to the Galapagos so could appreciate these DVDs,1411257600,,90,5.066666666666666
8611146,5,B00F0N7Q1S,"The 3-D from these SKY - David Attenborough Blu ray's are SUPER !!! Great quality !!!! These are posted everywhere as region B,
but that is not true ALL COPIES ARE REGION FREE and should play in most 3-D players. I have no problems with the three 3-D titles I have purchased from vendors selling SKY 3-D Attenborough BBC Nature Productions. Galapagos has never looked better,
it's educational and the 3-D will knock your socks off!",1399852800,7,431,4.684210526315789
8611147,1,B00F0N7Q1S,"The contents of this 3 part series are fantastic, brilliantly filmed, and educational and this rating pertains to the disc itself and not the content. The contents get 5 stars based on the 2D Sky TV version which I have seen before and am watching again right now as I write this. I bought a 3D TV for Christmas and want to check out the 3D version. However...

Here's the issue...Why is Amazon.com selling Region 2B Blu-rays? American buyers need to be aware this disc may not play on North American Blu-Ray players. Unfortunately I'll have to wait for the Region 1A version.

(PS) When is Amazon going to wise up and put 2 rating scales on their media website; one for content, and one for the media packaging?",1387929600,13,712,4.511627906976744
