As soon as I saw it on Amazon, I had to buy it. It is VHS, another soon to be dead format, but I plan to convert it soon. Basically this video is 6 hours of random cartoons from what can be called ""the golden era"" of animation (before the use of computers really). This includes classic Looney Tunes, an episode of the Groovy Goolies, what looks like the old Casper the Friendly Ghost, an episode of the Fat Albert cartoon, and much more. When I say random, I mean it. I still love this collection though and can't wait to get it converted for my own viewing pleasure.",1437523200,,713,4.136690647482014
