4390984,1,B004JAUDK4,"I really wanted to like this movie but when the previews for other movies started on the dvd, I knew Horrid was going to suck. And it did! Now Horrid was not the worst zombie movie I have seen... Darklands, the Rising wins that award hands down, but it was really close.
So this guy is going to get married and his friends are giving him a bachelor party... it is just too bad that the guy's friends happen to be the biggest TOOLS on the face of the Earth! So they take him to some strip club that looks like it was a set built in someone's basement that had been converted into a den in the 1970s. And then from there they go to some po-dunk town that has nothing but a bar, woods, and possibility some military medical facility (how else would the infected patient made it to that town?).  Sounds like the ultimate of great bachelor parties.  But that isn't what makes Horrid HORRID....  It's the fact that the make-up looked like crap, the acting from most of the cast was stiff and the script /dialog was totally lame, emotionless, monotone, mindless babble.  I have seen better make-up on your average wanna-be ""fan boys"" at zombie walks and better acting in grade school plays. And, I am sure porn from the 1970s has better scripts.  The makers of Horrid needed to spend less time watching Cinamax After Dark soft core porn and Girls Gone Wild and more on character development, writing believable dialog for the script and working with all the actors so they ended up knowing their character and delivering convincing dialog.
And so what have I FINALLY learned....  Low budget zombie movies, unless distributed by a big name studio, are a complete waste of your money and time and they SUCK! No, you don't have to be a total Hollywood tool with a mega bucks budget to make a good movie... you need to take your time and write dialog that real people would say at the appropriate settings and times and find people who can pretend that what is going on in the script / movie is real taking place around them. And make-up... sometimes less is more and no, black lines on the body do not look like realistic veins; colored, rolled up dried liquid latex applied with wet latex on the body looks like veins.",1309478400,4,2209,4.455445544554456
4390985,4,B004JAUDK4,"For an independent horror film, this one is not too bad. It has everything you'd be looking for in zombie flick. Hot chicks, action, a bit of comedy and of coarse zombie carnage.  I would suggest you give it a shot",1302220800,3,214,4.219512195121951
4390986,3,B004JAUDK4,"Look at that great poster,Cool huh ?

This is a Zombie Gone A Hunting in Wisconsin, Yes..No cheese jokes either.

Cast was well versed unknowns probably from plays and commercials.

Effects were out of ""This Is A Zombie Look' school and all right , Some of the bites and tearing will cool though.

Gun shots with computers are pretty effective now and cheap we guess, Because everybody is doing them.

Horrid has a sense of humor,YES...A funny at most times take on goings on and making Whoppee with dead people is kind of creppy when skin is discolored and they prefer to bite then suck.",1301270400,2,588,4.561904761904762
8431826,3,B004JAUDK4,"Horrid begins by showing a group of soldiers running after a scared woman in the woods.  She soon gets shot in the head while encountering a man.  Right when a soldier is about to shoot the man, one of his own soldier guys shoots and kills him from behind.  The soldier takes the man inside a home but suddenly the man turns into a zombie and attacks the soldier which encourages him to leave the house and run away.  Just then the other soldiers barge in and shoot the zombie guy in the head.

We now see a man having an angry conversation on the phone while his wife comes in and says they need to talk.  He pushes her away.  She gets angry and says she's leaving him because he only thinks about himself.  He says he's angry about his car issues.

Another couple discuss a bachelor party in their apartment room.  We now see one of the soldiers from the first scene break into a garage and steal a car.  The bachelor guy and his friends have a party at a bar.  They discuss a bigger party this weekend.  Two men take out the trash and watch an older man drive out of the parking lot.  Inside the bachelor guys have fun with their stripper pole dancers.  Enjoy the nudity fellows!

The friends get into the car and decide to head to north woods.  They arrive at night. A guy says, even though it's his bachelor party, to try and keep his strippers to a minimum.  Huh most guys would never say such a thing!  They break into an abandoned house.  The bachelor asks ""Did you take me here to kill me?"" and his friend says ""If I wanted to do that I would've done it back in town to save myself the gas money"" lol.

We now see a man come home and walk upstairs with a club in his hand thinking an intruder is in his house.  He opens his bedroom door and a man punches him out the moment he walks inside.  The music here sounds like the Rainbow song ""The Gates of Babylon"".  The robber says ""A patient escaped from your facility"" while the guy's tied to a chair.  Meanwhile in the other scene we see the bachelor friends enter a bar.  One guy wonders if something is going on here.  The bartender says lots of folks left town when a company came in and bought land.  They saw unmarked trucks coming and going intended to build a new facility.

We now see an older man who's a doctor yelling at a young man who contacted a disease.  The doctor mentions a disease where patients eat off their own arms and that the disease can spread within a matter of hours.  The doctor needs the young man to get a blood sample.  Back to the bachelors.  They eat a fish flavored pizza.  How absolutely *disgusting*.  Girls come in and the bachelors flirt to them.  One guy doesn't know how to make the right moves and mentions his ill stomach which grosses the girl out.  The bachelors and girls party while a song plays that sounds like early Faith No More.  A couple drinks is all it takes to turn these young men and women into party freaks.

We now see a man trying to drive down the road but the virus he has is getting the better of him.  The doctor recommends making no contact with anyone, and if he does he must kill that person.  At the bachelor party an angry man storms in the bar and asks one of the bachelors why he's hitting on his sister.  He gets defensive and a little commotion occurs between the two.  Meanwhile we see the doctor sneak into a computer room.  A female doctor walks in and thinks whatever he's doing is suspicious so she calls for someone but he convinces her not to.  The way he disconnects the phone for her is suspicious enough, but she treats it as normal!

The bachelors take the girls back to their house much to the anger of that guy who didn't appreciate them hitting on his sister.  These young men and women automatically jump on each other.  The blonde girl tries hitting on the bachelor who's getting married but he gets nervous.  They kiss anyway but he eventually pushes her away for good.  One of the friends walks around with his video camera.  He sees something odd.  A man with bruises and scars on his face.  When he puts the camera down he doesn't see anything.

One of the friends tries to make out with a girl until she suspects her brother is outside and watching through the windows.  That guy who was driving around with the virus comes into the house and tells the bachelor guy that he shouldn't be here.  He needs a blood sample.  One of the friends tries throwing the virus guy out of the house but he pulls a gun and says he needs  blood sample of someone named John.  They wrestle and the one friend is able to obtain the gun.  He tells the virus man to leave but not before he gets his blood sample from the wall.

After he leaves the bachelor and friends talk about the man and why he needed a blood sample so badly.  The friends quickly return to making out wit their girls while the bachelor says ""You've got to be kidding me!""  I agree.  What a bad direction for the story- returning to more sex.  You've got to be kidding me!  Meanwhile the doctor researches something that makes him sick on his computer.

The next day the friend asks the bachelor if he's ready for marriage.  He says he found the right one.  One of the girls (the blonde one) says she feels like she's on fire.  A guy thinks it's her hormones.  The bachelor walks through the hallways and sees the sex massacre that occurred last night.  At the bar the protective brother has a drink and says he's going to beat those bachelor guys up.

When the girls walk into the bar the angry brother asks where they've been.  The blonde girl says something is growing inside of her.  The brother leaves and looks for the men.  Meanwhile a woman pulls over and sees a car parked by the side of the road.  When she opens the car door and goes to look inside, a man grabs her head from behind making her scream.

One of the bachelor's friends sees stretch marks on his belly when he looks in the mirror and wonders what it is.  The friends want to go hunting in the woods.  The angry brother enters the house where the sex occurred last night and has himself a beer.  In the woods the one friend asks the other if he ever took a training course and he says ""You mean shoot my 3rd grade teacher in the butt with a pellet gun?  Yes!""  The angry brother drives away after disconnecting the wires in the bachelor friends car.  They walk down the road.

The angry brother sees a car parked alongside the road and goes to see what's going on.  When he checks out the car a man infected with the zombie virus grabs him from behind and tosses him around.  The brother takes off in the woods but the zombie is hot on his tail.  He bites the brother's arm and drags him away.  At the doctor's office the doctor injects himself with something.  The female doctor wants him to unlock the door but he says his work can't be disturbed.  He says he just needs the blood sample.

At the bar the blonde haired woman eats a burger like a maniac.  The bartender says ""How can a tiny girl like you down so much food?"" and she says ""Just get me another burger man"".  The bachelor and friends walk down the road and complain about being hungry.  They see two cars parked by the side of the road.  When they get to their friend his back is turned and they see him eating a squirrel raw with blood all over the place.  His friends say ""Keep your distance you sick son of a gun!""  At the bar the blonde haired woman sees blood on the neck of the guy beside her and mustard licks him.

A woman in a car pulls up to to the bachelor and his friends.  They mention the deserted cars and the woman says she knows the people who drive them.  We now see a woman going to town on a guy in a truck.  He... is done too fast, hehe.  When he leaves the vehicle, a zombie pulls the girl out of the truck from the window.

The blonde girl and her bloody neck boyfriend drive to the woods.  She says she has a surprise.  She takes her clothes off... then leaps across the seat and bites his neck.  The bachelor friends and the woman suspect something is wrong when they return to the deserted cars at night.  The woman sees dead bodies and freaks out.  They hear odd sounds and recommend driving back to the bar.  Odd the woman wouldn't suspect these bachelor friends might have something to do with the dead bodies.

We see another man and woman go at it.  When the girl jumps on top of him she slaps him around.  She walks away leaving the guy alone to pick his nose.  The soldiers from earlier enter the doctor's office.  He's now frustrated over the lack of blood sample.  The soldiers demand he cease activities and leave the room.  They've been monitoring his room.  He insists his work cannot be disturbed.  The soldiers say they must control the outbreak and say it's too late.  The doctor says all he needs is one more sample and it's on the way.  He can stop the virus from spreading.  The soldiers break in and shoot the doctor.

The bachelor's friends and woman return to the bar.  They mention the cars parked by the side of the road and say they need help.  The one friend who was eating the dead squirrel heads to the bathroom and throws up blood.  The woman says she sees her blonde haired friend outside.  The bachelor's friends recommend leaving that blonde girl alone because there's something wrong with her, but the woman says she might be hurt.  The blonde girl stumbles around outside.  When the woman asks if she's okay she says she couldn't help it.  She's just so hungry.  She then attacks the woman and the bachelor.  She gets smacked across the back by the woman, allowing her and the bachelor time to head back to the bar.

A zombie attacks more men outside before they're able to drive away.  Inside the bar the bachelor and his friends lock the door but... they can't get one door locked in time so the zombie enters and eats the closest guy.  When the bachelor and his friend returns to the main room they see their friend as a zombie tearing his face.  Odd moment there since it looks like the guys face changes shape.  The other zombie in the room gets shot in the head.

The bachelor friends shoot the blonde haired woman too.  The bachelor says ""You can't just go shooting people!"" and his friend says ""They aren't people anymore"".  The woman runs outside asking for her friend.  He appears... as a zombie, and chases her into a house.  While she locks herself in a bedroom he comes up to the door.  His voice turns into a demon as he demands to be let in.  The bachelor and his friend run around outside wondering where to go.  They enter a house and see a couple dead people on the floors.  Suddenly a female zombie comes in and attacks the friend but she's soon shot.  While a couple guys are fishing on a deck by a lake the one guy asks his friend ""Hey, anything biting over there?"" and just then a zombie comes up from behind and bites his neck.  Yeah man, zombies are biting!

The woman who trapped herself inside form her demon-voiced male friend is still worried for her safety.  The guy leaves just for a moment and returns with an ax.  He enters and bites the top of her head.  So much for peace of mind.  Good grief!  The squirrel eating friend attacks his one friend, but the friend is quickly able to beat him to death with a knife.  No more squirrel eating for you!  Two friends take off in the woods in their pursuit for a cabin.  When they enter a man is seen eating blood on the kitchen floor.  The bachelor walks outside to throw up when a soldier appears.  He thinks the bachelor is a zombie and punches him.  He gets up and runs away.  Meanwhile two zombies appear and eat the soldier's neck.

The bachelor runs through the woods and sees a parked vehicle with a dead man inside.  Just then the angry brother from earlier returns.  ""I just want to talk!""  The bachelor runs through the woods.  The angry brother attacks the bachelor but he's able to retaliate by slicing his chest.  The angry brother gets up and continues to run after him.  The bachelor is able to smack him again while hiding behind a tree.

We now see a new woman walk into a house and clean up beer bottles.  It's the bachelor's girlfriend.  Just then the angry brother runs up to the girlfriend but the bachelor intervenes and runs after the angry brother... who's running after the bachelor's girlfriend.  He shoots the angry brother but it's too late- the angry brother already bit his girlfriend.  The bachelor shoots his girlfriend in the head before she's able to turn into a zombie.  He tries to shoot himself but he's out of bullets, so he picks up a metal pole and jams it in his chest.  He dies beside his girlfriend and the angry brother.  We now see three tree trimmers in a forest.  When one of them goes to take a leak a zombie attacks him.  The other zombies appear and attack the rest of the employees.

Horrid is probably a weaker zombie movie.  I like how it takes place in the woods and bar.  No problem with the setting.  But at least half of the story is partying and sex.  The typical things that should be done and over with early in horror movies take up a good chunk of the time here.  The acting isn't that great either.  The story's decent and the deaths are good, so the movie's okay.  I recommend it.",1502150400,,13220,4.28160453808752

8431832,4,B004JAUDK4,"Must see for zombie lovers, and must MUST see for any Wisconsinites! Lots of nods to things only someone from WI would understand, Hodag anyone? Overall movie starts a little slow, but picks up, especially with the chase scenes. Favorite scene hands down is when Matt loses it and when he stands up and it starts to rain- awesome cinematography. Also had a great soundtrack, good mix of music, I especially liked the road trip song in the beginning.",1357603200,,449,4.69620253164557
8431833,4,B004JAUDK4,"This low budget continuity issue zombie film takes place in Wisconsin. The movie opens with military personnel killing an infected human. These are fast moving zombies. We find out the cause of the infection about a third of the way into the film. Infected people sometimes speak with voice enhancers, sometimes without the enhancer, while others are typical blue faced mutes. Make-up was not consistent either.

We then move to the subplot which makes attempts at humor. Matt (Roland James Williams) gets his car repossessed then asks to borrow his ex-girlfriend's car as she is walking out the door. He and Craig (Kyle Berg) have a bachelor party planned for John (Kevin Kiser). After getting thrown out of a strip club, they head up north to a small town so the subplots can be united in zombie bliss.

The acting was at the Mendoza line and the dialouge better than most low budget disasters. The film extra features a band, one that must have been used for a better than average metal sound track. The film has numerous gratuitous nude scenes that make it into both the outtakes and extended scenes, one which included a sex scene with the woman being disgusted and swearing that I thought should have stayed in the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (thank you Liz Ribarchek, Amber Rae Halama, Jocelyn Ridgely, plus an extra and 2-3 strippers) 3 1/2 stars",1348444800,,1369,4.7923728813559325
8431834,1,B004JAUDK4,"This movie was a complete waste of $2.
I knew after 3 seconds that it was going to be lame.
I take chances on indie flicks here & there because sometimes they work out well.
I fast forwarded into several parts of the movie and it was all unentertaining.
Yes, I know it had a low budget, it sucked either way.

I write this because of the reviewer at the top, dude if you are reading this, that was the funniest s!@# I have read in long time. The sheer length of the ""I hate this movie"" makes it even funnier, that you spent the time to write a mini-essay to say things like ""write believable"" dialogue! Are you effing serious dude? ITS A ZOMBIE FLICK, a fun one at that and it does have a sense of humor. Give it a chance, it's worth the rental at least.",1328745600,4,535,4.0
