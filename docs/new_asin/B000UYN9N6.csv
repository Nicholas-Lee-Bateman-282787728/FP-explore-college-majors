8215665,4,B000UYN9N6,"The song Ghost Riders in the Sky has haunted me since childhood well over 50 years ago. I saw Gene Autry's film when it first came out, and now again finally on DVD.

The story moves well, and the plot is a good one about a crooked land deal and a false accusation. The film begins with the title song, which is repeated at a crucial point later in the story, and finally shown again as the film draws to a close.

But the story really has nothing to do about those legendary ghost riders going through the clouds chasing the ghost herd forever. That could make a good plot, which maybe someone will take up someday.
