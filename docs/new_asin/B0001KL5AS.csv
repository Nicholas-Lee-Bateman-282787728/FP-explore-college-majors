2008397,4,B0001KL5AS,Movie covers the topic of the time of the creation of the Jewish state of Israel. I've never paid much attention to this time in history and knew little about the subject so this film has encouraged me to examine this period. Nicely done film with many long shots that illustrate the dangerous migration into an unknown future that the Jewish people encountered after the war in Europe.,1383091200,,386,4.6911764705882355

2008399,1,B0001KL5AS,"This movie was disappointing. It was a series of mostly pointless scenes, with no character development, plot, or even reason. I kept watching because I figured it would have to get better sooner or later.  I was wrong.  Don't waste your time on this one.  All they do is walk around, mutter a few lines, and occasionally die for no apparent reason. I have seen better acting in preschool productions of Ishtar.",1378944000,,411,4.680555555555555

2008403,2,B0001KL5AS,"Amos Gitai has lost something since his directorial debut film ESTHER. In 1985, he took the biblical story of the book of ESTHER and placed it in the ruins of former Arab and Middle-Eastern Jewish area of Haifa, Wadi Salib, that had been destroyed in a 1950s riot.

Gitai's fast moving action film KIPPUR, released in 2000, about the war that Gitai had personally survived as an Israeli soldier, had been 27 years later turned into this movie from his war experiences. (In fact, the final scene of the intense action-adventure war movie KIPPUR actually comes directly from Gitai's personal experience.) ESTHER and KIPPUR were outstandingly good films that made Gitai's career.

Now comes KEDMA (in Hebrew meaning, ""towards the East""). What a cinematic disaster!

Basic story: Opening with a wordless sequence, set in May 1948, in which surviving, Holocaust-traumatized European Jews arrive by boat (named Kedma) in Palestine, eight days before creation of the state of Israel, the oft times controversial Gita's latest examining of his nation's history and challenging contemporary reality focuses on Israel's founding moments. The passengers are anxious to get off the awful Kedma. But British troops try to stop them. They get caught up in poorly scripted retaliatory fire by the Jewish secret army (Irgun?) who try to help the arriving Jews get settled in a kibbutz -- in the middle of nowhere.

Attempting to follow the immigrant/refugees on their first steps in the 'promised land', Gita casts an unflinching eye over the justifications for his country's existence. Putting the issue of Arab territory and their grievances centre-screen [given extra resonance by the current situation in the Middle East] it's also telling about British imperial responsibility for the mess in Palestine. However, at its heart is the story of Jewish and Arab displacements, anticipation, endurance and comradeship; demanding of all sides in its understanding.

There are three small groups of Jewish refugees (two to three per group) from a boatload of people. The movie follows them in an amateurish manner and never drops a hint as to what ever happened to the other few hundred Kedma arrivals. By amateurish I mean, the leader of a detachment of British soldiers urges his men on in American accented English, while one of the Brit soldiers carries an unfurled Union Jack -- presumably so you'll know who the British soldiers are.

Other segements are just plain silly. With British soldiers after them, each of the three groups makes camp fires at each of their rest stops -- as though the British wouldn't spot smoke in the middle of a desert, and the camp fire ashes wouldn't give their positions and directions away.

Then the British are equally stupid: every time they begin closing in on the fleeing Jews (schelpping their heavy valises) and their Israeli commandos -- who rarely fire their weapons -- they begin firing shots at them off camera (presumabaly from a distance). If the British were sincerely trying to round the Jews up for deportation -- or simply to kill them -- then why would they fire lots of warning shots, giving their adversaries many chances to escape?

Then there's a ""classic"" battle scene between the Israeli commandos, accompanied by the newly arrived Kedma-im, and Arabs shooting at them from atop a hill in a building. You can clearly hear gunshots rapidly firing at our heroes advancing up the hill, but there's no sign on the summit of the telltale smoking guns or Arabs firing their weapons.

Maybe Gitai has been out of uniform too long. Alas, from beginning to end nothing is genuine about this movie except the landscape. The only thoughtfully played out scene is that of a surviving teacher, who had just arrived on the Kedma and witnessed the British and Arab battles with the Jews. In the last five minutes of the movie, he breaks down into an hysterical soliloquy that questions and challenges virtually all of Jewish history and its outcome up to his own existence. That was really something.

Overall, the viewer will be burdened by waiting for KEDMA to get better from its opening scene until just five minutes before it ends.",1137801600,10,4166,4.989913544668588
2008404,2,B0001KL5AS,"There are some excellent and very insightful viewer reviews already here on these pages.  I concur specifically with the statement made by the spotlight reviewer:  ""I really wanted to like this film.""  Exactly.  But, wow, director Amos Gitai really makes that tough.  He's the king of the overly long shot.  At the moment you think: okay, sir, let's move on with the story, Gitai's camera lingers, and lingers, and...lingers for minutes longer than necessary.  I should have read my coverbox better: Gitai also directed 'Kadosh' and I had the same frustration there, where viewers were forced to watch the protagonst getting dressed in the morning for what was easily a 10-minute stretch of wordless action bordering on inaction.

When I pulled up the page for 'Kedma' in amazon, it tells me to pair my potential purchase with 'Broken Wings.'  Take my advice and don't do that.  I was totally enchanted with 'Broken Wings' and was making my way though a list of Israeli productions and bumped into 'Kedma.'  I think those of you who liked 'Broken Wings' will be similarly disappointed.  If you want to extend your Israeli-originated viewing beyond 'Wings,' I suggest taking a path well away from Gitai and down a road that includes the great drama 'Time of Favor' and - especially - 'Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi' (a personal favorite).",1109376000,14,1331,4.945945945945946
2008405,2,B0001KL5AS,"I really wanted to like this movie and was excited to see something concerning the birth of the 1948 war for Israeli independence.  Yet, this film was slow, it was too melodramatic, and, worst of all, it was a historical fabrication.  The Haganah and the concentration camp refugees are made to look like the aggressors in the film, which is the contemporary spin put out by leftists like Noam Chomsky but this view is completely false historically.  If a person knew nothing about the 1948 war they would have no idea, after viewing Kedma, that the Jewish settlers were attacked on all sides by the armies of four nations.  This was in response to the UN's mandate establishing one national zone for Israelis and two for the indigenous Arabs in the regions disputed.  The refugees were certainly not the cause of the bloodshed that is depicted here.  They acted in self-defense, but Kedma portrays them as hopping around and throwing Arabs off their land where ever they found them.  Why there is so much self-hatred in Israel is completely beyond my comprehension.",1091491200,14,1066,4.824175824175824
2008406,5,B0001KL5AS,"This wonderful film is yet another tour de force of Gatai's epics regarding Israel wars.  In Kippur he showed us the sting of battle on the Golan.  In Kedma we are shown the all to real story of Jewish Holocaust survivors arriving in 1948 and being instantly thrown into battle for the new state.
The beginnings are on the Kedma, a leaking old ship transporting hundreds of survivors.  They are met at the shore by Jewish Palmach Guerillas, and are immediately fired upon by English soldiers.  This begins one of may scenes that seems more fit for the stage then film, and perhaps is indicative of the writer being more familiar with theatre production.  While shots are heard of camera the English soldiers are seen on Camera trying to hold the Kedma survivors.  Why aren't the Palmach firing on the English soldiers?  Why aren't the English shooting the Pamachniks?  Who is shooting?  Its not entirely clear why the Palmach didn't lay down covering fire and get the survivors away from the beach, and the `battle' doesn't seem realistic.  Nevertheless it paints the symbolic picture of the English, who are leaving Palestine in three days, still trying to interdict refugees who have no where to go.
Throughout the rest of the film we follow the new arrivals as they go from survivors to soldiers.  Several scenes tell the symbolic tale of the founding of Israel.  Many of the longer speeches seem fit more for the stage then screen.  For instance one Haganah Jewish resistance leader proclaims ""Thank God we got rid of Religion'.  IS the statement an irony, or is it simply translated wrong into the subtitles?  Several other `scenes' that appear on the back of the film don't even seem to be included.  For instance the cover shows a woman helping `Manachem' load his rifle.  While we see plenty of this main character we don't seem to ever see his fried help him load his rifle.
The Battle scenes are perfectly fine and show the large numbers of holocaust survivors who sacrificed so much so that their children would have a chance to live free.  Also several scenes show the fleeing Arabs and their interaction with the new arrivals, presaging the current peace problems.  Two long monologues symbolize both peoples feelings. One loan Arab claims that his people will become a `wall' while a Jewish school teacher proclaims that Jewish history should never again be taught the way it had been in Europe.
In the end this seminal work is a wonderful story of the founding of the state, on the personal level, in the same style as Kippur.

2008426,1,B0001KL5AS,"This movie really went no where. It also is apparent it was filmed with a low budget. Character acting was wooden. Scenes with ""British"" soldiers were almost comical.  I turned it off after 30 minutes.  Save your time and skip it",1406764800,,229,4.560975609756097

2008430,4,B0001KL5AS,"Despite the evident Zionist propaganda about ""exile"" and ""wandering"" ""Leaders telling Palestinians to flee"" etc., there are things to like about this film.  However, the viewer should keep i mind that the disheveled motley passengers of the ship ""Kedma"" are not disembarking to Palestine to live in peace with the indigenous people.  These men and women fully intend to supplant the Palestinians, take their land, their homes, even their bank accounts.  They are not heroes at all.  And the fact that they are survivors of the misery of Europe does not sanctify their struggle or make them heroes.  Only about 10% of survivors opted for Palestine (Eretz Israel).  Many peoples have suffered but it characteristic of Jewish filmmakers and intellectuals to isolate Jewish suffering from general suffering overall, suggesting that Jewish suffering is different, different like everything about Israel.  One of the immigrants sees that clearly. For his people, he says ""...grief is more valuable than joy.""  This is a good summary of the utility of grief to Jewish nationalism. (Note:  I deliberately shy away from using descriptors like ""Israeli"" because, first, this is what the State of Israel prefers, i.e. it does not recognize such a nationality, and second, because the Zionist project has had broad backing of Jews worldwide, or at least that seems to be the case.)

All the wrong impressions aside, the film is nonetheless a good, sensitive take on the impossible situation of stealing a country from its inhabitants.",1402185600,2,1522,5.200819672131147

8013591,5,B0001KL5AS,"Gripping, true to life, historically accurate, this film records the unbelievably tough struggle that Holocaust survivors endured to get into the only refuge left to them from 1945 to April 1948, when the British took down their flags and exited a now-partitioned Palestine. The Jewish partition was renamed ""Israel"" and became a state on May 12, 1948.  Less than 24 hours later, it was attacked by five Arab nations.

The film records a group of refugees, Holocaust survivors, arriving off Palestine in the merchant vessel Kedma.  The name is Hebrew and means ""woman of the east""-- ships being until the past couple of years always referred to as feminine, ""she"" or ""her.""  As they wade ashore, they are shot at by British army troops lying in wait.  They have to make it through hostile territory to a kibbutz sitting precariously some kilometers away.  And that is the story, the individuals, little snippets of their past lives, the agonizing journey to the kibbutz.

It isn't all one-sided.  While Arabs living in the Jewish side of the partition had to leave their homes,Jews living in the Arab side did likewise.  But in all honesty, you never hear about the Jews being displaced, only the Arabs.  Still, the shared humanity of both peoples comes through in this film, the tragedy of both sides that goes on today.  The film was nominated at Cannes, and rightly so.  It is a powerful story, beautifully told, the horror and the suffering, the loss, the displacement, the  grief, made all too clear.  Most people today are too young to remember when it was going on-- that is why it is so important that the story be told through the generations.  One of the most poignant moments in the film comes when a group of Arabs, their belongings loaded on donkeys, meet a now-much-reduced group of Jews resting for a few moments from the exhausting, terrifying trek.  A Jewish man asks ""Who are you? What are you doing?""  Answer"" We are running from the Jews.""  Two groups of human beings confronting each other, the Arabs not even recognizing that Jews  they were talking to were Jews, the Jews sharing in the same loss, the same incomprehensible suffering.  It's a moment in film almost unsurpassed in what is left unsaid but so horrendously clear-- that we are all related, we are all brothers and sisters.  Finally comes the ultimate violent confrontation between the two groups.  A soliloquy by a Holocaust survivor is matchless.  It's as good as Shakespeare any day.  This is an absolutely must-see film.",1462406400,3,2509,4.822014051522248
