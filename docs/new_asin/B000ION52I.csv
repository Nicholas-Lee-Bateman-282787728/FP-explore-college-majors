I'm glad to see a Region 1 DVD is now out, I recommend this to anyone and suggest you might want to invite friends over with snacks and wine and watch it without subtitles to add to the fun.",1208995200,,351,3.943661971830986
2659982,4,B000ION52I,"My wife and I saw this last night at the opening night of the Wisconsin Film Festival.  It did not disappoint.  As an earlier reviewer stated, if you are a fan of the James Bond series of films...in particular the Sean Connery version of Bond...then you absolutely MUST see this!  I was thrilled to see it is available in a Region 1 format.  Highly recommended!  :)",1207267200,,365,4.46969696969697
2659983,5,B000ION52I,"I saw this movie at the Portland International Film Festival with a friend of mine.  I wanted to see a French film, and this was the feature that was the most convenient for both of us to attend.  Foreign films are out of my norm for movie watching.

This film is a spoof of the James Bond movies, and they did a wonderful job making Dujardin look like Sean Connery.  For those people who have seen the James Bond films or any film similar to those, this is a great film.  It's hysterical.  I highly recommend this film.",1204761600,,520,4.255102040816326
2659984,4,B000ION52I,"I saw this at a recent Film Festival and was unaware it was out on dvd. Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Sean Connery Bond fan. It appears as the makers of this film went to great lengths to make this parody seem like one of Sean's Bond films. The star is an agent sent to Egypt on assignment.  His 3/4 profile is a dead ringer for Connery. Not only that, his little mannerisms are straight out of Goldfinger or Thunderball. The way he will grab his tie, or button his coat. His face mannerisms. They even dress him in the same gray suit Connery wore in Goldfinger. But its only at certain angles he looks just like Connery which makes it all work. He is sort of a dopey Bond-type. Not a complete knucklehead like Austin Powers or Inspector Closeau. Just enough to make it funny, though he does do some really, really stupid things. Its a very funny movie that I think anyone that enjoys spy films and comedies will enjoy.",1203206400,,932,4.265536723163842
2659985,4,B000ION52I,"OSS 117: LE CAIRE NID D'ESPIONS (OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies) earned the 2007 Csar (French Oscar) in the Best Production design category. The film is based on the original characters of writer Jean Bruce. Back in the sixties, after the international success of the James Bond movies, French producers decided to produce a certain numbers of films based on such popular heroes as OSS 117 or Le Tigre, aka The Tiger. Claude Chabrol, for instance, directed two Le Tigre movies in 1964 and 1965.

Now, if you haven't seen one of these movies, I really don't know whether you'll like this parody.

2659986,5,B000ION52I,"I saw this film in Paris back in April. It had no subtitles, and my grasp of French is not great, but since the comedy is mostly physical, it had me rolling in the aisles.

2660033,5,B000ION52I,"Absolutely hysterical. Some call it a Bond-spoof, but I think it's more than that. It's an homage to the spy thrillers and comedies of the 60's. Jean Dujardin is PERFECT as agent OSS 117. It's pitch-perfect in French arrogance and Peter Sellers-like buffoonery.

2660076,4,B000ION52I,"I happen to have been a fan of Jean Dujardin long before he won the Academy Award for The Artist, and this is one of two spy films spoofing James Bond movies by substituting a look-alike who hasn't a brain in his head and who goes blithely through assignments ridiculing religious and social  traditions - like killing a Muslim summoning the faithful to prayers from his minaret, because the call disturbs Dujardin's sleep.

2660083,5,B000ION52I,"Yes I did order it for the subtitles after seeing some of it online with only French, and I DID enjoy it reading the subtitles on the DVD...  but surprisingly for the same things I saw not knowing the plot, as when I could read the subtitles and understand the plot... i.e. the cigarette smoke wafting upwards while in a 'speeding convertible' (chuckle), playing with the light switch in the chicken house (silly repeated gag), the camera panning away from the start of a romantic scene only go too far and catch the couple in a mirror and retracting abruptly (LOL)...  it all made me laugh at the silliness...  but I have to say it unexpectedly bordered on stupid at times.

Regardless, the effort they made (as seen in the DVD extras, making of.. etc) to recreate a 1955 world visually, and to mimic 60's filmmaking was fun to see, and Jean is fun to watch...  just don't expect the plot to be that interesting, at least it wasn't for me, but the movie was ""fun"" nevertheless.

and the used DVD came sealed and promptly, in good condition.",1394236800,,1041,4.51063829787234

2660117,1,B000ION52I,"Normally subtitles don't bother me, but this movie's did. It was probably because I didn't find the film to be as engaging as to make the effort worthwhile. I found the slapstick below juvenile.",1392681600,,194,4.735294117647059
2660118,1,B000ION52I,"I was expecting some 007 knockoff.  But this was a comedy masquerading as a spy movie.  While I enjoy old French films, this is not in the same category as other Canale + films I have seen",1392076800,,188,4.054054054054054
2660119,5,B000ION52I,I watch this movie over and over. Jean Dujardin is a master of timing. Yes you will have to read the subtitles. Great foreign comedy!,1390867200,,133,4.36
2660120,5,B000ION52I,James Bond spoof  la Franaise. Lots of fun. Even those who don't speak French would enjoy this. More subtle in some respects than Austin Powers.,1389571200,,144,4.76

2660134,1,B000ION52I,A rather stupid and boring attempt at a spy movie. It should be placed in the farce category rather than where it is.,1388448000,,117,4.130434782608695
2660135,5,B000ION52I,This was a very witty and fun Spy flick.  Supposed to take place in 1955 it felt like I was watching a Sean Connery Bond type flick.  I watched the French with English subtitles and the humor was not lost.  Great movie.,1387843200,,219,4.166666666666667
2660136,4,B000ION52I,"Funny, awkward like Cousseau, dresses like Bond but not as nice looking. If not a parody, then a copy-cat film with too much humor to be taken seriously.",1386892800,,153,4.5

2660138,2,B000ION52I,"This was a not very engaging or even funny film.  It did not seem to make any sense, though I know that it was a ""spoof"" on '00'.  Even the subtitles translating the rapid French dialogue did not do anything to brighten up this sad flick.  It just seemed to be a rather haphazard adventure/spy thriller sprinkled with uncertain innuendos.",1383436800,,338,4.6
2660139,4,B000ION52I,"I didn't think I would like this one, but found myself laughing throughout. The lead is so cluelessly full of himself you end up liking the guy and just wanting to see what he will say or do next.  Scenery was not bad either.",1382140800,,225,4.113636363636363

2660141,5,B000ION52I,"I saw this on a tiny B&W set in French with German subtitles late at night in a hotel in Dusseldorf.  Catching only a few words here and there, I still laughed 'til my head hurt.  The first of the enormous series of OSS117 movies to be done as a comedy, directed by The Artist Director Michel Hazanavicius.  Jean Dujardin (George Valentin in The Artist, french superspy Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, OSS117, here) is a remarkably gifted physical comedian.  I can't imagine anyone watching him start to dance with himself in a Cairo nightclub or setting off indignantly to silence a Cairo muezzin who has interrupted his sleep without finding it downright hilarious.  My kids think I'm nuts for loving this movie, but what do they know?",1378166400,,734,4.703125
2660142,5,B000ION52I,"I can't say much more than has already been said - it's a very good film and pretty funny. If you want to step outside the Hollywood box and grab a nice 'foreign' film, this is the one. I will now be interested in seeing other ""OSS 117"" films. As on reviewer said, don't be put off by the subtitles - it's just a very funny movie - had me laughing pretty good.",1377993600,,360,3.9452054794520546

2660165,4,B000ION52I,How OSS 117 ever gets anything done is a mystery but his bumbling ineptitude somehow manages to result in saving the world AND getting the girl. Lots of fun!,1377388800,,157,4.448275862068965
2660166,5,B000ION52I,Great movie! Cannot imagine there is a more politically incorrect film out there than this French masterpiece. Really love it!,1376956800,,126,5.35
2660167,5,B000ION52I,Leave it to the French and wonderful actor Jean Dujardin to do the proper 007 spoof.  This is a funny and fast moving film from start to finish.  If this interests you look for the next adventure of OSS 117 it is a good as this.,1373932800,,228,3.9347826086956523

2660169,5,B000ION52I,"This is a very well done spoof. It is not completely ridiculous like the Austin Powers or Get Smart movies. It creatively comes up with plausible scenarios that are given a hilarious spin. Causing the uprising because the call to prayer kept OSS 117 awake at night was inspired. I love these two actors together, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. Not as much ""chemistry as they had in ""The Artist"", but still uplifting to see them together.",1371686400,,439,4.714285714285714

This is so funny.  It is an absolutely perfect spoof of Sean Connery's James Bond (who I hate; I know I'm probably the only one but Daniel Craig is the best by far; except for Skyfall, again I'm probably the only one who hated it).  It's like British humor, where you laugh when you see it & you still laugh when you think about it even though you're not watching it.  I highly recommend this.",1368144000,3,649,4.086614173228346

It's a modern movie that perfectly captures the techniques, attitudes, and acting of a bygone era, all to the delight of the viewer.  It's an old story that is still completely relevant to this day and age, brilliantly acted, scripted, and filmed.  I highly reccommend this to anyone who says the French haven't got a funnybone.

2660225,4,B000ION52I,"Had to watch this, after seeing Jean Dujardin's brilliance in 'The Artist'! In this French spy spoof, which is slow to start but gets infinitely better as it goes along, Dujardin is like a hot, suave and chauvinistic Inspector Clouseau - not the brightest bulb in the bunch, but still somehow able to find and get the bad guys. The film, very funny in spots, is certainly not hurt by the presence of Berenice Bejo, Dujardin's co-star in 'The Artist' who plays an Egyptian spy whose duty is to help Dujardin's character foil the evil plot.",1357257600,2,538,4.614583333333333

2660227,4,B000ION52I,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago and was taken by its campy nature, its absurdity and irreverence. No, its not a French version of Naked Gun and its certainly not a Bourne or Bond wannabe, its humor, its camp and its a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Unless you speak French you'll be reading the subtitles while you enjoy the french accents and if you're game for that be prepared since European comedy timing is a bit different than what passes for humor here in the States. Overall I really enjoy this movie. Looking for something different? Give it a try, but know that there's no guarantee that you'll like it, only that you'll likely appreciate a different perspective on what passes for humor.",1354579200,3,710,4.469230769230769
2660268,5,B000ION52I,"Like i said, this is one of the best parodies ever done on the James Bond movie's, also you can find back some traces of the Pink Panther and Hitchcock movies in this movie. It shows also some cliches and misunderstandings people from the west had over third world countries and vice versa (even between men and women). I really liked the movie and the OSS actor also does a good Sean Connery impression.",1348444800,2,404,4.472972972972973
2660269,5,B000ION52I,"This movie is hysterical if you grew up watching - or are forced to watch re-runs - spy movies in the 60's. James Bond/Sean Connery, The Saint/Roger Moore, Harry Palmer/Michael Caine, even the spontaneous night club musical number - they're all here.  It helps to know that the OSS 117 book series, begun in 1949 by  Frenchman Jean Bruce, were heavily imperialistic, with the hero bringing Western culture to 'backwards' Third World countries.

Dujardin is funnier than Steve Martin and Peter Sellers combined!! They may have each played a bumbling french detective, but they have nothing on a real frenchman playing the clever but often clueless spy (at least when THIS actor is playing the part!) Dashing, dangerous and a pretty good shot (most of the time), Hubert is France's answer to James Bond and god help anyone on the wrong side of his good intent!  The exotic settings (1945 Germany and then 1955 Cairo), and cheerful performances by the entire cast make this a movie I know I'll watch over and over.  Berenice Bejo is petite, feminine and oh so lovely that it's hilarious when she finally loses her cool trapped within a pyramid. And every scene she shares with the sexy Jean Dujardin as Hubert are sweet and funny. How she keeps a straight face sometimes is amazing! They show a tiny bit of their dancing ability in this movie, (which shows up for real in The Artist in 2011) as she teaches him how to ""mambo"" in 10 seconds. They remind me of William Powell and Myrna Loy of the 30's - they have charm, great chemistry and you wish they'd make 50 films together. Especially if it's wriiten and directed by Michel Hazanavicius. ""How's the veal stew?"".  It's hilarious from start to finish.  And the gag reel is so funny you'll wish you'd been there during the filming. It's a 10 out of 10, 5 tickets, 5 stars, $10, or however you want to rate the best of the best!

2660272,4,B000ION52I,"Recent Oscar winner Jean Dujardin hams it up in a spoof of the gloriously suave and impossibly perfect Ian Flemming creation. Not entirely beating a path toward originality, given '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Secret/dp/B000Y90VO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Secret!</a>', the Austin Powers movies and the recent hit toon '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Archer/dp/B00475B0G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Archer</a>', but well executed regardless.

Director Michl Hazanavicius elegantly captures the essence of the early Bond-isms: The trademark exotic settings (with staged rear projections 'natch), superficial overacting, and the sometimes ridiculous trappings of Cold War spy plot adventures. Seriously, name one post-WW2 bad guy who sought global domination. Bill Gates and the Rothchilds don't count. The former because he didn't have a white Persian cat, the latter because they were already running things since before either of the world wars.

My only complaint: I truly felt they missed the boat on the gadgets. The production would've been so much more enjoyable had they incorporated some of the 1950-60's ""state of the art"" tech. Would've loved if the filmmakers incorporated a laser beam watch or transforming benign objects into a gun.  Honestly, if they had a goofier version of the Scaramanga Pistol - I would've given this five stars for that alone. :-D

Still, pretty entertaining, if somewhat embarrassing to screen - as the generations which can't appreciate the anachronisms of the genre will likely not undertake the effort to understand what Dujardin & Co are spoofing.

To really appreciate what's being presented, I would recommend first screening '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldfinger/dp/B00000K0E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldfinger</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderball/dp/B00000K0E9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderball</a>' - then watch OSS 117. :-D

His performance in this film was superb and dead on. In my opinion, this is probably one of the best spy sattires I have ever seen. I thought the mix of suave James Bond with a mixture of a clueless Inspector Clouseau and Detective Frank Drebin was incredible. There were numerous moments that reminded me of Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun movies. I think having a sauve character that was either conveniently good as a spy or somehow horrendous was a wonderful mixture and made a fantastic character come alive. Also, I loved that the film style was made as if it was produced in the era it was depicting. I thought it gave a nice touch to the film because for me it really set the mood for me in terms of it being set in the 50s.

2660275,5,B000ION52I,"I learned about this movie after seeing the Oscar nominated The Artist (DVD + Blu-ray Combo)also starring Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo and directed by Michel Hazanvicius.

Dujardin bears an uncanny resemblance to Sean Connery which makes him a natural choice for this role. You may be surprised at how gifted he is as a comic actor, and how funny this movie is. Based on a series of French books called OSS 117 by Jean Bruce which appear to spoof James Bond, it's somewhat of a combination James Bond and Inspector Clouseau, and has a wonderful French ambiance, mood and soundtrack. The attention to detail is incredible.

The first of over 100 OSS 117 books was written by Jean Bruce (JB) 4 years before Ian Fleming's 007 James Bond book. The books have been translated into 17 languages and sold over 75 million copies worldwide.

Curiously, even though Hubert Bonnisseur de la Bath is a secret agent, people seem to know who he is. When a fellow agent and his best friend is killed he gets sent on a mission to Egypt and goes undercover as the owner of a chicken factory. An attractive young lady (Berenice Bejo) is his liaison, and he immediately rubs her the wrong way with his insensitive comments. As he hunts for clues he inadvertently upsets the local Muslims, when he silences a Muezzin who wakes him up with his yelling. And there are Nazis too.

I also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OSS-117-Lost-in-Rio-English-subtitled/dp/B0043GY1LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OSS 117: Lost in Rio (English subtitled)</a>&nbsp;featuring the same actor and director. I prefer the Cairo movie as it has both actors from The Artist. It's interesting to watch Dujardin's independently moving eyebrows in these movies.

Dujardin has since since engaged an eyebrow coach to coax those wayward brows into submission in his sublime majestic turn as Georges Valentin in The Artist, which has been winning huge during awards season with 10 Academy Award nominations and seems to be destined for Oscar glory. Recently it won 7 BAFTA Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Music, and Cinematography.

Without a doubt, Jean Dujardin has a strong screen presence and is incredibly skilled at physical comedy and along with his trademark facial gestures that were so endearing in THE ARTIST. The chemisty between Dujardin and Bejo that was so strong in THE ARTIST is missing here. Secret Agent Hubert Bonisseur is a lady's man in addition to being a first class klutz. It's a story we have seen so many times before with the comic spy yet it just does not seem to work well in OSS 117.
Bonisseur is sent to Cairo to investigate the apparent death of his best friend Jack, who is also an OSS agent. He goes undercover as a partner in a poultry company in Cairo. Here the silliness continues with caged chickens as the source of humor. There is even a ""chicken fight"" and no, the chickens are not fighting each other.

A blithe, brilliant French satire of Sean Connery/Roger More-era James Bond films. Comic actor Jean Dujardin grinningly portrays 1950's secret agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, a grinning colonial chauvinist utterly incapable of self-reflection or insight, who swaggers and postures his way through the Suez Canal crisis, waving the banner of France as best he knows how. Bond fans with a sense of humor will delight in this film's spot-on recreation and skewering of the stylistic cliches of those films. Although the humor becomes fairly repetitive and single-note towards the end, this is still a very funny, very fun movie. Definitely recommended!

It's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not, and I won't try to analyze such perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)!

Everything is old fashioned here, from women's clothes (sigh!), Mambo dance, the ""hero singing""... (""Bambino"" sounds like an Italian canzonetta sung in... arabic :)!).

Hubert is physically imposing, but dumb as hell. From all the 007s, he looks like Sean Connery, but is definitely more sympa because he's... silly, speaks his mind all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him. In short, as an anti hero, he rocks :)! Sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh.

Brnice Bejo is the true queen of the film. Graceful, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, to the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts. It's surprising to see her that ""sexy bomb"", thou.

2660423,4,B000ION52I,"Taking French cinema's once much-loved 60s superspy and turning him into a politically incorrect figure of fun, a lot of the historical injokes do get lost in translation, but there's enough going on that's funny enough in its own Austin Powers fashion to make this well worth a look.

Although often regarded as just another Continental Bond ripoff, Jean Bruce published the first of his 91 OSS 117 novels in 1949 long before Ian Fleming reached for his Book of British Birds, and the first of seven `straight' adaptations was made in 1956, six years before Sean Connery was fitted for his tux. Later entries in the series got Frederick Stafford the lead in Hitchcock's Topaz and John Gavin the role of James Bond in Diamonds Are Forever - well, at least until Connery decided to come back after all. But this isn't the Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, aka agent OSS 117 of Bruce's novels. In this 2006 comedy, the character has been turned into a walking criticism of outdated colonial attitudes: he's ridiculously overconfident, has questionable flashbacks of happier days with his dead sidekick on the beach, loves to fight, hates dust, can't understand why Arabs would make up their own language and religion, hands out photographs of the French president to locals as tips and ferments an uprising when he stops a Muezzin from making the call to prayer because it's interrupting his sleep. Smug, xenophobic and pig ignorant, he's the kind of man who'll take an insult for a compliment because he doesn't understand it. Like Inspector Clouseau he's completely unaware that he's an idiot, which is why the character works so well. Behind his blundering ignorance is a mockery of France's colonial past and western arrogance: his attitudes and certainties are as hopelessly outdated as they are delusionally overoptimistic

It doesn't hurt that he looks the part. With leading man good looks and a suit that could have been swiped from Connery's You Only Live Twice wardrobe, Jean Dujardin is exactly the kind of type who would have been cast in a serious OSS 117 film in the 60s. And this really looks like it could have been shot then - the look of the film is spot-on, with its wonky backprojection and that ever-so-slightly-faded colour that was a feature of many early 60s continental Scope films, while the production design looks just like a mid-60s film's idea of the mid-50s.

With so much attention going to the central character and recreating the Sixties style, the plot is pretty slight - it's mainly a chance for Bath to proudly flaunt his ignorance while poking fun at spy movie clichs, Nazis and chickens (the source of the film's best running gag) - and the film itself is often more amusing than laugh out loud funny. But after a slowish start it becomes rather infectiously likeable, and it's worth seeing for Dujardin's rendition of an Arabic version of Bambino alone - it's a real showstopper in the very best sense of the word!

Alongside a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with optional English subtitles, the disc has a decent set of extras - a making of documentary that details the attention taken to make the film look so close to the 60s films it parodies, some deleted scenes and outtakes, nearly all of Dujardin cracking up with laughter.",1232755200,11,3268,4.830357142857143
2660424,5,B000ION52I,"This movie is amazing!  I don't know whether to recommend it as a 1.) hysterically funny comedy; 2.) one of the best James Bond spoofs ever made; or 3.) a brilliantly-conceived artistic exercise in re-creating -- with perfect attention to detail -- a 1950s Technicolor adventure thriller.  It succeeds wonderfully at all three endeavors.

Using 50-year-old filmmaking techniques, director Michel Hazanvicius accurately captures the tone and look of the movie from that period.  His DP uses lighting systems and camera lenses from that time, but I have no idea how he achieved THE COLORS he did, colors we've not seen since Kodak stopped manufacturing those dyes so many years ago!  I honestly was not aware I was watching a movie made only two years ago; I would've figured maybe 1960 through 62.  A jaw-dropping achievement.

Fans of James Bond and/or spy films will be delighted by how the conventions -- and clichs! -- of the genre are dead-nuts PERFECTLY captured, caricatured, and (lovingly) lampooned.

And I would count star Jean Dujardin amongst the likes of Peter Sellers and Steve Martin as one of the greatest physical comedians and actors-manque that I've ever seen.  Simply put, the man's a genius, and I plan on catching up on everything he's done.

I love this movie to death!  And, if you love spy movies and comedies, you will too.  If you enjoy watching a great actor marshal all his powers in a masterful performance, you will too.

2660425,5,B000ION52I,"Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, a.k.a. OSS 117 (Jean Dujardin), is the most incompetent and culturally insensitive spy who has ever lived. However, none of his superiors in the French secret service seem to have noticed. After the mysterious disappearance of his former partner, Jack, OSS 117 is sent to Cairo to complete the assignment that Jack was working on. He must go underground as a poultry farmer and stop an arms smuggling operation involving Egyptian extremists and Nazis.

This is the eighth film to feature OSS 117, a James Bond-esque spy (the first OSS 117 movie actually pre-dated the movie of ""Dr No""). Apparently the previous films in the series were relatively ""serious"" espionage films, made between 1956 and 1970, but this more recent update of the series is played purely for laughs and it succeeds immensely. ""Cairo, Nest of Spies"" is a very silly film that had me laughing harder than I have in a long time. What makes this film so great is the fact that the humour plays on so many different levels. Not only is there a lot of very funny visual humour (simply the expression on Dujardin's face was enough to make me laugh in a number of scenes), but the script is also very well written and contains a lot of great lines. Although made in 2006, the film is set in the 1950's and much of the humour comes from OSS 117's complete lack of cultural awareness and of his patronizing attitude towards all Egyptians.

Don't be put off by the subtitles, this is a great film that will appeal to any fan of spy comedies such as ""Austin Powers"" and ""Get Smart"", even if you don't speak French.",1228089600,35,1604,4.585365853658536

2660427,4,B000ION52I,"This French spy spoof is like a more sophisticated Austin Powers.  It's a send-up of slick, cold war era espionage tales, but with knowing ironic humour about the realities of colonialism and regional  politics.  While not every joke lands, there are a few belly laughs.  It's over-the-top fun that is sure to amuse with a terrific production design and lively score.",1224374400,,367,4.967213114754099

No, that transcript is not excerpted from secret Oval Office tapes; it's an exchange between the cheerfully sexist, jingoistic, folkway-challenged and generally clueless French secret agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath (alias OSS 117) and his Egyptian liaison, the lovely Larmina El Akmar Betouche. The scene is from OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, a gallingly amusing Gallic spy romp from director Michel Hazanavicius.

The director and his screenwriter Jean-Francois Halin adapted the script based on characters from the original ""OSS 117"" novels by Jean Bruce, which concerned the misadventures of an Ian Fleming-esque French government agent. The books inspired a series of films, produced in France between 1956 and 1970.

After a brief b&w prologue depicting agent OSS 117 (Jean Dujardin) handily dispatching a Nazi adversary from a plane (sans parachute) in a wartime escapade, the film flash-forwards to the year 1955. Hubert (as we will refer to him going forward) is sent to Cairo to investigate the mysterious death of a fellow agent. He is assisted by the aforementioned Larmina (Bernice Bejo) and just like an undercover 007, he is given a business front. In this case, our intrepid agent poses as a chicken exporter; and yes, all of the inherent comic possibilities involving this most ubiquitous species of barnyard fowl are gleefully explored (and the credits assure us that none were harmed during filming).

As the intrigue thickens, Hubert encounters some sexy royalty in the person of La princesse Al Taouk (Aure Atika) as well as the usual Whitman's assortment of shady informers, sneaky assassins and dirty double dealers that populate exotic spy capers. In the interim, thanks to his deGaullist stance and blissful cultural ignorance of the Muslim world, Hubert manages to deeply offend nearly every local he comes in contact with. As one Egyptian associate muses to himself: ""He is very stupid...or very smart.""

Hazanavicius has concocted a tremendously well-crafted and entertaining spy spoof here that actually gets funnier upon repeat viewings. Unlike the Austin Powers films, which utilizes the spy spoof motif primarily as an excuse for Mike Meyers to string together an assortment of glorified SNL sketches and (over) indulge in certain scatological obsessions, this film stays manages to stay true and even respectful to the genre and era that it aspires to parody. The acting tics, production design, costuming, music, use of rear-screen projection, even the choreography of the action scenes are so pitch-perfect that if you were to screen the film side by side with one of the early Bond entries (e.g. From Russia With Love) you would swear the films were produced the very same year.

I also have to credit the director's secret weapon, which is leading man DuJardin. He has a marvelous way of underplaying his comedic chops that borders on genius. He portrays his well-tailored agent with the same blend of arrogance and elegance that defined Sean Connery's 007, but tempers it with an undercurrent of obliviously graceless social bumbling that matches Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. One of the film's running gags has Hubert uttering ""deep thought"" epiphanies that belabor the obvious. While getting a massage, he announces: ""I love being rubbed with oil.""  While at breakfast, he realizes: ""I love buttering my toast."" Stopping to gaze at a public fountain, he wistfully offers: ""I love the white noise water makes."" DuJardin delivers these lines with the knowing wisdom of a high lama, imparting a Zen proverb. I tell you, the man is a bloody genius. Not to be missed.",1222732800,79,3870,5.128571428571429

I have no idea what you expect from a movie as everyone's tastes are different... but some of the scenes in this one are absolutely Classic in comedy, IMHO. I'm submitting this review because I'm buying the DVD for my wife as a present... the first DVD I've purchased in a long time.

Hilarious.",1221868800,2,491,4.212765957446808
