Even Nessuno si salva da solo is very good,  I believe that the previous one ""Don't move"" with Penelope Cruz and Castellito as actor and director, was better. Any way, I hardly recommend both. One note, there are no english subtitles in ""Nessuno si salva..."". The subtitles are only in italiano,  for the deaf people",1465776000,,434,4.773333333333333
