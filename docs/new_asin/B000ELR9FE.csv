8110966,3,B000ELR9FE,"In the beginning we see a woman named Serena stick a gun in her mouth, pull the trigger but no bullet comes out.  She eerily walks around the house seeing blood on the walls.  The story kicks in 3 days prior.  A gothic friend named Rachel picks up Serena along with two other girls (one a romantic book reader and the other a freak who likes to make sandwiches in a weird way).  They head to the beach when they have car troubles.

The girls sit around the car stranded for a while.  A REALLY good instrumental song with a build-up to a soaring guitar solo plays, and it's awesome.  They eventually walk down the road.  The gothic girl, Rachel, hears laughing voices call her name until Serena snaps her out of it.  It's hilarious when the girls ask Rachel where the house is and she points and says ""Right there!"" as dramatic piano plays, haha.  Rachel takes out a skeleton key and opens the front door.  While inside the girls think they can sneak outside if someone comes.  Rachel starts feeling her stomach.  Serena worries but she says she's fine.

The girls walk around and find bedrooms.  Rachel thinks ""Something is not right"" (with her).  The girls play with tarot cards, read books and get showers.  Serena cries for some reason.  Lovely piano during this long scene.  Suddenly the woman reading a book gets smacked in the face and the weird sandwich maker girl knocked out by a kitchen cabinet door that swings open.  Rachel runs into the bathroom while Serena is taking a bath and tells her they have to leave.  The tarot cards reveal something evil is here.

Rachel tries to leave but Serena closes the front door.  She asks Rachel to stay here with the girls because there's psychos out there at night.  Rachel agrees to stay up until morning then leave for the car.  Serena has a dream she's arguing with her boyfriend since he was cheating on her with another woman.  The girls walk through the woods the next day and find that their car is gone.  They stay there and wait for a ride.  Pretty soon they walk back to the house but Rachel says it's evil there.  She says ""You'll be sorry"" as the girls walk away.  Rachel says ""You're not going to get me"" as she walks by the river where she heard voices earlier.

Serena and the other girls discuss their past relationships.  Rachel comes back and they all hug.  She can't believe someone stole Rachel's car.  They play around listening to loud music.  No not that kind of playing around.  Dancing!  I love the song we hear.  ""Our love is a no win situation!""  The weird girl sees a weird skeleton image when she looks in her bedroom mirror.  We then see her covered in blood and being dragged away.

Another girl falls down outside and says ""Death comes to us all"" while watching the moon.  These girls had way too much to drink.  Serena plays with a gun she finds in a drawer.  She passes out on bed and dreams about that argument with her boyfriend again.  Serena dreams she wakes up, sees herself in bed, walk down the stairs with lights flickering all around and asks where the other girls are.  Serena walks outside to the river where Rachel heard those voices.  She enters a tunnel and... falls.  She wakes up terrified.  It was just a nightmare.

Serena walks around but can't find Rachel or her friend.  She heads to the river and enters a nearby tunnel.  The book reader girl tells Serena that Rachel and the other friend headed to the coast.  Serena talks about an out of body experience.  Serena takes the book reader friend to the river and asks if she feels strange being here.  The book reader girl takes the road to find their friends while Serena waits at home.  It's night and the girls haven't returned.  Serena grabs a light and runs outside until she gets uncomfortable.  Rachel returns... in the dark which is strange.  She says the place is evil and doesn't know how to stop it when asked.

Serena explains she hasn't seen the other girls since last night.  The lights turn on and they hear their weird sandwich maker friend in the bedroom.  She's actually in the wall.  The door slams and the lights flicker violently.  The girl escapes the wall and stabs Rachel.  We now see the opening scene with Serena sitting around depressed and pulling out a gun.  I forgot to mention she hears a loud voice say ""Serena"" after she pulls the trigger.  This voice is important.  The soundtrack resembles a certain Castlevania game here.  Suddenly Serena hears a loud sound when opening the shower curtains.  She then finds herself in darkness.  She wakes up in a bathtub after asking a man why he's doing this to her and his reply is ""Come find out"".

Serena takes a walk through the tunnel outside again.  She opens a bag before we see her argue with her boyfriend again.  She has an ax to grind... literally!  She walks to the garage and calls in her boyfriend.  She slices the ax across his stomach and kills him.  Serena smacks him several times.  We now see something very different.  A woman hands a man an envelope with money inside and asks if it's enough.  He says it is.  The man pulls over while driving and tosses a bag over a cliff.  Back in that tunnel by the river Serena runs home and cries.  She's traumatized that her boyfriend hit her and that he deserves to die.  The male voice Serena hears says ""It's no accident your car broke down, it's no accident I killed your friends... and it's no accident you killed me"".  Wow this storyline got really good!

Serena freaks out and runs outside.  She watches her evil dead boyfriend flicker the lights in the house.  She returns inside the house... but she really shouldn't have done that.  Serena yells ""Let's do this the right way"" when suddenly she's smacked by an ax and finds herself somewhere else.  She asks if she's in hell as Rachel appears with an ax.  She swings the ax at Serena using one arm.  They both fight over the ax.  After this Serena spits on Rachel after she falls over from a botched ax swing.  I got a strong deja vu feeling like I've seen this scene before, but I've never watched Evilmaker.  Weird.

A man grabs Serena by the throat.  She asks to see his face.  It's her boyfriend she killed but his face is much different.  In the worst acting performance of the film the weird sandwich maker girl appears and says ""Leave my friend alone!"" as she points to the boyfriend.  Serena can't believe she actually killed her boyfriend, but the sandwich maker girl says he only made Serena *think* she killed her boyfriend.  All this time Serena thought Rachel was her best friend.  Now the story gets confusing.  It was the boyfriend who came after Serena, not the other way around... I guess?  The lights flicker heavily as Serena picks up that ax.

Serena sits on a couch and says ""Come out come out wherever you are"" to her boyfriend.  He sneaks up from behind and grabs her ankles.  She says ""What's wrong are you afraid of me?""  ""I'm not afraid of you!""  She smacks her boyfriend around and says ""I don't want to beat you- I forgive you"".  He says ""No"" in another bad acting performance.  Suddenly 80's-like guitar soloing (that same awesome song we hear earlier) and cheesy special effects occur as the boyfriend disappears.  Serena drops the ax and cries.  This whole scene really feels like a mockery of 80's horror films.

Serena appears outside and the book reader girl approaches her.  She says she got a ride with someone, went home, got her car and returned.  She tells Serena she doesn't look fine.  The book reader girls picks something up off the ground and Serena slices her with an ax to end the movie.

I almost gave this movie 4 stars but the story gets really confusing during the final 20 minutes so I can't do that.  I don't know if Serena killed her boyfriend or if he killed Serena.  I don't know what happened to Rachel.  The poor acting is a big distraction and makes me take the story way less seriously.  Too much happens at once near the end and trying to sort it all out is hard.  I'd still recommend this movie, but remember it loses steam at the end.  The first hour was pretty spooky and awesome though.",1500595200,,8096,4.475961538461538
8110967,3,B000ELR9FE,"One Decent low budget B flick and fun.  I love B films. With the film Evilmaker, Get the pizza and popcorn and watch it. I wonder why Stephanie Beaton retired so young. The plots remind me of old time horror comic books. Buy it, you will like it. The second film EvilmakerII is beyond bad. I would give it minus 2 stars. The script just plain stinks,and the camera work is as good as any person who owns a camcorder could make. The new characters are terrible[Beaton is not in this film except in a flashback]. The main character who is supposed to be cop is so miscast that it is not funny. He looks like a bar bouncer in a rundown bar. The music also is also poor in the second film. It is so BAD, it makes the movie painful to watch too. Watch the first movie, avoid the second.",1403308800,,781,4.1381578947368425
8110968,2,B000ELR9FE,"Two movies-in-one here. Evil Maker 1 and 2 gives us a hodge podge of ebb and flow; the fist one is about a group of friends (all girls) that go on a road trip and end up at a house where evil dwells (oops, that's a title to a different movie); the movie bogs down with the obligatory last-act-of-the-movie-first scenario that tells us...nothing...and the movie is about thirty minutes too long at getting to the conclusion, which involves a confusing plot twist and an equally confusion murderous response. eh...okay b-horror with pizza and beer.

The sequel sort of rearranges the storyline from the first film and becomes even more confusing...or maybe it's just confused all on its own...than ever. The sequel is not even good b-horror, but after a few beers you won't care.",1350777600,3,777,4.798507462686567
8110969,1,B000ELR9FE,"Okay, if you include this with 49 other movies for around $20 as I had, you may be incensed by epics such as this.  However, if you actually purchase it on its own, you should be asking yourself just WHO are these people that are allowed to sell camera equipment to just about anyone.  FORGET about gun laws... get an I.D. check on these people.

Oh well, maybe all this explains Obama...

By the by, if you DO happen to be of masochistic yearning, this movie actually does have a sequel equally effective in inducing in most viewers dull mouth-dropping experience.  I understand one can recreate the effect of absinthe by watching both serially, but might I suggest one not do so without the use of a lobster bib unto which to drool.

GO RED SOX !!!",1301443200,,750,4.437956204379562
8110970,5,B000ELR9FE,"I really like this movie. Most people would think this movie sucks because of the very low budget and all that implies, but I think it was done quite well for what it is. Very interesting ambiance, and I liked the music chosen for the movie.",1189382400,3,241,4.260869565217392
8110971,3,B000ELR9FE,"Starring Stephanie Beaton (the ""Witchcraft"" series) and introducing Felicia Pandolfi, ""The Evilmaker"" is John Bowker's first entry in the realm of the ultralow-budget or no-budget B-movie.  You wouldn't know it, though; compared to others of its ilk, he shows more skill (aided by D.P. Joe Sherlock) than most other's tenth or eleventh flick.
B-horror film reviews are a relative thing, as is B-film enjoyment: you like them for thier limitations.  They can either overcome them and work or be overcome by them and end up as camp fun.  ""The Evilmaker"" is one of the former, notable for Bowker's obvious love of filmmaking.  It makes you forget the budget, or lack thereof.  He also has an ""I'm going to make the movie I want to make"" kind of thing going on.  There's no arrogance to it, instead a welcomed sincerity.
Not that ""The Evilmaker"" doesn't follow the expected conventions: Beaton bares her breasts (now there's a title!) several times.  But she also acts (the film opens at it's conclusion with a distraught Beaton putting a gun to her head), and her character (Serena) is more complex than you might imagine.  (So, too, with Pandolfi's role of Beaton's slighlty goth friend.)
The short version: Bad relationship-escapee Serena is convinced to take an obligatory vacation with three obligatory friends but thier car obligingly breaks down near the obligatory haunted house.
What occurs there is not obligatory.  Some might wish it to be --genres are often like comfortable blankets to curl up in and we don't want them unravelling at the end -- but others will find its uniqueness more than welcomed.  Bowker's making the movie he wants to now, going off in unguessed-at direction, getting philosophical, making the plot twist and turn into a shape all his own.  Like it or not, its refreshing, and it shames a lot of other films of its kind for mimicking thier bigger budget counterparts and not being more personal. (At this level -- underground moviemaking -- what's the point?)
Fans of s.o.v. no-budget or ultralow-budget B's should keep an eye out for more from Bowker, Pandolfi, etc. and should check out ""The Evilmaker"".",983232000,3,2137,4.957983193277311
