4763369,4,B005LAII2Q,"This movie definitely is having a rough time with critics and audiences, for various reasons all around. Why though? From start to finish, I was laughing consistently with the goofy and conversational humor of these guys all hanging out and bustin' up aliens together. The aliens looked great (in my opinion) and it was all just a ton of fun. It had may qualities of a campy 80's flick and references abound which made me enjoy a heck of a lot more. Overall, it ain't perfect, but it's a darn good popcorn flick nonetheless.",1344211200,62,524,4.585106382978723
4763370,2,B005LAII2Q,"I think I laughed in The Watch. Hmm, wait! Yes, I did laugh--twice. Don't worry. I won't tell you when I laughed. I don't want to spoil those few delicate gems before they ripen. I will say they both included Jonah Hill and that British guy (Richard Ayoade). Sadly though, but apparent nonetheless, these two tickles in the throat are nowhere near enough to redeem this woefully inept movie.

It all begins with a very suburbanized Evan (Ben Stiller), a man who does everything and knows everybody. Evan hosts the running club, the yoga club, and many, many others while always failing to see that he has no real friends and his relationship with his wife is non-existent. Basically, this guy looks like he just wandered off of Wisteria Lane (hat tip to my wife's favorite mock soap opera). All's well in Evan's little, boring world until strange events start to plague his community. In order to uphold the peace, Evan starts a neighborhood watch. Apparently, nobody really cares about the town's stability because the only three people who show up are Bob (Vince Vaughn), a guy who wants to get out of the house, Franklin (Jonah Hill), an wannabe cop and adrenaline junkie, and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), an oddball new guy in town--by the way, Evan, Bob, Franklin, and Jamarcus, what a combination.

After the group gets together, they decide to go on a stake-out, and from there, you'll lose any lingering grip on the unwieldy plot as all hell unwinds. The movie takes one arbitrary turn after the next until sputtering into a nonsensical conclusion. To be fair, the writing doesn't really betray any desire to have a sensible film. Once, a character even makes the claim: ""We're aliens. Destroying civilizations is what we do."" And this wouldn't be so bad if there was humor and coy surrealism to replace it. Perhaps this would all work if Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller wielded the form they had in Dodgeball instead of attempting the middle-aged-suburban-white-guy-who-just-needs-to-love-his-family routine. But this movie is bent on gushing out relentless potty jokes, dimestore morality, and a cheap plot, all of which prevents it from going anywhere.",1343865600,,2158,4.958563535911602
4763371,5,B005LAII2Q,"I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, but it was a great mix of dirty Stiller/Vaughn comedy and an alien sci-fi genre. Still plays an active participant in the community named Evan Trautwig. When a security guard at his store is brutally killed, Evan is determined to find the killer and bring them to justice, so decides to form a Neighborhood Watch. Only 3 men are interested. Vince Vaughn as Bob, the father of a rebellious teen and wants to party with his new buds. Jonah Hill plays Franklin, the crazy one of the group who failed the written, physical, and mental health tests at the police academy. Finally, we have Jamarcus, a recent divorcee. Together, they form a bond a rid the neighborhood of delinquents and aliens from another planet. It was hilarious and awesome to see these guys fight aliens and save the world from extinction. I would definitely recommend THE WATCH!!!",1343692800,20,900,4.738853503184713
4763372,5,B005LAII2Q,"This film changed its name from 'Neighborhood Watch' to 'The Watch.' A hilarious alien-invasion that entertains from start to finish. Great Acting Performance of cast, and Ben Stiller at his best. A group of guys want to get away from their dull, suburban lives and everyday routines. They conduct a neighborhood meeting for male bonding as they stumble onto extraterrestrial trouble. As a citizen police force, they attempt to defend Earth from an alien invasion. Some scenes are laugh out loud fun. A Great Summer movie, and I'd watch it again. Highly Recommended!",1342396800,13,566,5.096774193548387

4764196,3,B005LAII2Q,"This is a hard movie to grade.  It's a 2 but then again, it's a 6 out of 10 for just plain silliness and fun.  Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, a leaner Jonas Hill, and Richard Ayoade (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-IT-Crowd/dp/B00386US0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The IT Crowd</a>) star in this goofier than most alien films.  After the death of his night watchmant at Costco, Evan organizes a Community Watch program.  He pleas to a crowd at the local football game and eventually enlists three others: Bob (Vaughn), Franklin (Hill) and Jamarcus (Ayoade).

Intertwining with the main storyline is Bob's high school daughter, Chelsea (Erin Moriarty - Hope Schlottman from Jessica Jones) and her numerous beaus including an incredibly strong Jason (Nicolas Braun).  R. Lee Ermey pokes his head out for a short bit as the overbearing Manfred.

There's a lot of juvenile humor, definitely a lot of sex talk and innuendo.  The characters are mostly two dimensional and the writing is just okay.  So what makes this so good?  It's just funny in a very stupid way.  The Watch wasn't likely to win anything of than guffaws of high school boys.  However, it did get me snickering a few times as well.  Richard Ayoade's character is almost identical to Moss from The IT Crowd and I'm pretty sure that's why he was hired.",1454630400,,1350,5.137614678899083

In fact, Vaughn and Stiller are no shining thespians either. Ayoade can be forgiven this one indiscretion, as long as he doesn't let it happen again. The rest of the cast should be driven 100 miles into the desert and made to walk back to Hollywood, barefoot.
I feel like I should be compensated for sitting through this drivel, like a tester at a pharmaceutical lab that gets the stuff that gives him dysentery.

4764556,3,B005LAII2Q,"This should have been really good.  The problems are many.  First: There should have been four to seven more actions scenes.  The script wasn't written to create character fusion and banter.
  Second:  with a good plot There is no need to rely on immature humor- much of the humor was not immature- I'm just saying that it felt like some was thrown in because of the writer's  low self esteem.
  Third: Stiller seemed to have his character constrained in a can.  There were moments that he need to expand his emotions and affect  -from the can- but either couldn't or wasn't allowed to.
  Fourth: The side stories never helped or complemented the movie.  Ben Stiller's character shooting blanks [he's sterile] in no way helps the movie.
  Fifth: ""The Watch"" didn't feel original.  I'm thinking it was based on: ""The Burbs"", ""Evolution"", ""Employee of the Month"", ...
  But, if you haven't seen a lot of sci-fi comedies then this would be great.  If you have seen a bunch Then this is ""OKAY"" but nothing to write home about.

This is probably the worst movie that Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn or Jonah Hill have made. Truthfully, I wouldn't say that I am a real fan of any of them and this did nothing to change my mind. Vaughn plays the same motor mouth that he always does. Stiller plays the annoying  ""normal"" guy that is the hero but not really. Hill plays a wannabe cop with a weapons fixation and disturbing mental problems. The plot is threadbare, predictable, and not the slightest bit believable.

4764676,2,B005LAII2Q,"The Watch
 This two saw blade movie gives the audience no reason to plunk down the admission money.  You may safely skip the details if you like and go on with your life.
 The Watch has an interesting premise.  An alien advance party burrows into the ground beneath a Costco warehouse store and does some exploration while awaiting the main alien horde to arrive.  The Costco is in a small town in Ohio which is made to seem shallow, boring and provincial by the sophisticated Hollywood writers.  The writers haven't decided if they are writing a comedy, an alien adventure or Whos Afraid of Virginia Wolfe and we in the audience are just as mystified.
 Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg collaborated on the writing chore for Superbad, The Green Hornet and The Pineapple Express with uneven but not universally disastrous results.  Superbad in particular, which also featured Jonah Hill, was a brilliant success.  The Pineapple Express was enjoyed by many but The Green Hornet was almost unwatchable.  This duo was joined for The Watch by Jared Stern, most famous for penning Mr. Poppers Penguins.  One wonders what the producers had in mind when they put this writing team together.  The result was un-funny as a comedy, un-exciting as an alien action flick and vapid as cutting social commentary. This script should never have seen the light of day.
 The director of this exercise in futility was awarded the control of a $68 million budget and clearly had no idea what to do with that much money.  His previous Hollywood directing experience was with a film called Hotrod.  I never heard of it either.  He did not have the stature to demand the very best from his much more famous actors and in the large they did not deliver their best work.  Of course, with the lines they were given to recite, it is problematical as to what could have been done.
 Among the leading actors only Ben Stiller seemed to be at the top of his game.  He is a powerful enough personality and an experienced enough professional that he can produce a reliable performance regardless of his direction.  He is always Ben Stiller and you never get some lesser version of him.  Poor Vince Vaughn cannot say the same thing.  He needs to be directed to bring out his best but this time he is left on his own and it shows.  Saddest of all is Jonah Hill.  He had every reason to be glad to be reunited with the writers of his breakthrough movie, Superbad.  He has evolved over the intervening years, becoming more rounded and just plain better as an actor.  Witness last winters Money Ball where he had a dramatic role and excelled.  His writers have left him with more or less the same role he filled as a teenager, but less brilliantly written.  He tried to play down his talent, but seemed to keep floating above the material.  It is past time for Hill to stop with the dim witted bungler role.
 This one hour and 42 minute R rated (for language and a totally un-necessary orgy scene with lots to see) comedy misses on every count, acting, writing and directing.  The producers will be punished in the wallet for their efforts.  Good.",1427673600,,3104,4.607664233576642

4765200,4,B005LAII2Q,"I love each of these actors, and thought they'd be an interesting ensemble cast if the writing held up. I also did not expect this movie to be about what it was about (no spoilers).

Really, I am not sure why it didn't do well in theaters except maybe it's a bit formulaic and slightly crude. It was worth a $3.99 date-night rental, though, just to laugh together at all the, um, boy-parts-oriented jokes (and oh my, were there ever so many).

Plus, Richard Ayoade! Why not?

Pros: You'll be surprised at what it's really about, great actors; relatively non-repetitive crude jokes

Cons: A bit formulaic, a bit crude (for those sensitive types), and Ayoade doesn't get the screen time or writing he deserves",1406160000,,707,4.67741935483871

Is it still funny? Yes. If you are looking for Thorough or Shakespeare, you will be disappointed. This is a good comedy. It is along the lines of Caddy Shack. Caddy Shack is considered a comedy classic. Did Caddy Shack contain crude humor? Yes. Nudity? Yes. Drug usage? Yes. If you are too uptight and puritanical to enjoy the classic comedies of Caddy Shack, The Jerk or Blazing Saddles; you will definitely not like this movie and should immediately check yourself in to a doctor to get the stick removed from your posterior. All I can say is, you don't see an R rated flick and then complain about language or nudity. Hello? R Rating? Use some common sense folks.",1404518400,,826,4.47682119205298

4765350,3,B005LAII2Q,"I watched this movie and I knew NOTHING about it as far as what is was going to be like.  All I knew was that the movie died at the Box Office because some idiot with a gun who was a neighborhood watch guy killed a kid who was also not so smart.  And the circus that surrounded that real life situation killed this film.

And that's too bad, because it's funny.  Totally not what I expected.  I expected a slap-sticky buddy caper comedy, and I got a buddy sci-fi horror (ish) movie.  And it was good.

Stiller and Vaughn are their normal good, and Jonah Hill was perfect in his role.  The character that I really enjoyed was Richard Ayoade's Jamarcus.

At times the movie felt like is was co-sponsored by Costco, Budweiser and Trojan Rubbers, but that's alright.  Each had its own part to play in the film.

While the plot could have been doable, the dialog was so horrible, inane, immature, stupid, dull, vulgar,and  uninteresting. There were deliberate moments of  'touching' and 'emotional' dialog which I can't understand what the purpose was. If you want to know what an untalented 13 year old boy would write about aliens and sex, then this is it. Don't waste your time or money on this one. If you are in the mood for juvenile fun that's okay, but this doesn't have it..",1396656000,,643,4.394957983193278

The yellow banner warning across the bottom of the jewel case is very accurate. Read it carefully before buying this film. There are several lewd sexual language and orgy scenes that had no bearing on the storyline and should have been edited out. The only worthwhile part of the film was at the end when the battle with the aliens in the Costco takes place. If the crude sexual language and orgy scenes would have not been included, I would give this film 3 stars.

Then when the first character starting a solo party in the warehouse, I thought OK, now things are warming up quite nicely.  Once I saw this setting I suspected this was going to be a hilarious movie.  Alas, it was a disaster.  Who expects to see blood splattered in the first scene of a comedy?  It only got worst as the movie progressed.

Because of the constant profanity, I couldn't continue watching this movie.  I held on for about 30 minutes hoping that the profanity would stop.  It never ended during the time I watched.

4765414,4,B005LAII2Q,"When the night security man at the Glenview, Ohio Costco store is brutally murdered and the investigating sheriff proves to be an idiot, the store manager organizes a neighborhood watch to go after the murderer. Serious-sounding, but from there it degenerates in a pleasant enough comedy as only three people respond to his call and none of them really want to be wandering around at night surveilling anything except beer bottles, TV, and women.  When they come face-to-face with the killer and it turns out to be an alien, attitudes changes mightily.  When it's discovered the aliens are headquarters in the Costco basement, it turns frantic. This is a funny movie. It's also rude, raucous and  full of sexual innuendos and shocking vulgarities, an overabundance where one or two would really suffice.  The characters themselves are irritating but still likable and their actions as they ""save the day"" and their town put them in the reluctant hero category. There are surprises in store, as the people they believed to be aliens turn out to be something more surprising and those which the viewer may guess are, turn out to be. Woven into the plot is enough of each man's story to keep him interesting without it overpowering the main idea.  I was glad to see this didn't follow the usual cliched outline and had a few twists and turns along the way. There are a few fatalities but nothing shown onscreen except the demise of the alien which is overkill bordering on the ridiculous.

Normally, I love their movies.

This, however is NOT the type of movie they normally do. The script is very unimaginative. It has a ""seen it all many times before""  tone to it. There is not one  totally new idea in the entire plot.... What there is of it.  The normally amusing cast just don't seem to work well together. Vince Vaughn just comes across as bland, and boring, and really annoying.

Perhaps a more experienced Director could gave kept this meandering mess on track.... But after the first 45 minutes you gotta wonder if it HAD a director.

I really do not understand why any of the big actors decided to take a role in this movie -- must have been some BIG money involved.

The action (if you can call it that) is centered in a COSTCO store and the movie is so full of product placement that it could be classified as a COSTCO commercial.

The characters are shallow and vulgar and the plot (I use that term loosely) could have been written by a few hormonally-challenged teenage boys -- all the humor revolves around crotch jokes, sexual innuendo, and more product placement for condoms.

What little cohesion there is to the story and script went something like this... ""hey guys, we'll roll and you just riff and improvise for however long you feel it... just make it as relentlessly vulgar and sub-juvenile as possible and we'll see if we can cobble this mess together in editing.""

The result is so unendurably bad that it certainly qualifies as a Carlos Danger inspired high farce with the finished product being, for all intents and purposes, a flaccid, humor-free marathon of ""dick jokes"" and other scatological gems that seldom rise above the torso... all loosely framed within a preposterous storyline that has aliens preparing an armed invasion of earth from a Costco Warehouse Club somewhere in gated-community Ohio. An apropos locale since the jokes are manufactured in bulk with only a precious few hitting their marks - the rest inspiring a constipated grimace, uncomfortable groaning and/or lactose intolerance.

The Watch is an unfunny, uninteresting, obscenity... leaving me to conclude that somewhere in a celestial screening room, even Ed Wood is begging for mercy.",1376524800,2,1366,5.223744292237443

I was embarrassed.  For anyone associated with this tomato can clunker.  Hey, I love raunchy humor as much as any ornery sophomore, but the brand (for lack of a better word) of ""comedy"" put forth in THE WATCH was Gong Show.  Drivel.  Unfunny.  Nonsensical.  Lame.  And those are its good points.  When Stiller's character, an uptight Costco manager (yeah, I bet Costco was thrilled to be associated with this wobbler), elects to combat a recent murder by forming a neighborhood watch, it draws the characters played by Vaughn and Hill and some dude named Richard Ayoade to volunteer.  The source of the grisly new crimes is. . .other worldly.  And naturally we the viewers are going to be subjected to the actors mucking it up with some moron wearing an alien suit, paving the way towards a lame pizza supreme ending that will either tempt you to turn off your DVD--or put you to sleep.  Flat, uneven, banal, and boring, THE WATCH is a non-comedy to be avoided like the plague.  It's as if a group of 8th graders decided to get together and perform an impromptu comedy routine. . .only I would have more faith in the 8th graders.

4765740,3,B005LAII2Q,"In Glenview, Ohio there is a Costco run by a repressed manager, and are you surprised that this uptight guy is played by Ben Stiller? Ever the square, Evan (Stiller) founded the running club and the Spanish table at the community center. He and his wife are desperate to have kids. Evan doesn't have any friends. He's that kind of guy.

When the Costco night security guard meets an untimely (and pretty gruesome) death, Evan decides to establish a neighborhood watch, ideally composed of concerned citizens tasked with solving the murder of security guard Antonio Guzman and ""to generally get to the bottom of things.""

What Evan gets aren't civic-minded gents as much as a bunch of yahoos looking to get out of the house and hang out with the boys. Bob (Vince Vaughn) is that loud, obnoxious neighbor you love to hate. Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), shy and recently divorced, is looking for action (and, by action, I mean Asian women). Franklin (Jonah Hill), once an aspiring law enforcer, sees the group as a vigilante squad. This is maybe the most unprepared, most undedicated neighborhood watch ever. And in Glenview, Ohio, they may be all that stand between us and an alien invasion. We are so, so screwed. This is how Falling Skies and After Earth happen.

So, a disclaimer: THE WATCH is more clown house than art house. It isn't something you want to watch in the tea parlor with your aunties and your scones. It's not for delicate ears. This movie is raunchy and crude and vulgar. It's best enjoyed when you put on your frat-boy hat and you've got your immature buddies around. At least the trailer prepped you for what sort of movie it is. I did appreciate that the story didn't minimize the danger of the invaders. These aliens aren't that well established but we note that they're wicked mean and pursue a habit of skinning their victims. The green goo is, of course, an expected by-product. The humor is a cross between Apatow and the Farrelly Brothers. I couldn't believe the crazy things these guys were saying and doing, but, with me, it was a case of shaking my head but laughing, too. The performances, what performances? While I laughed a lot, I couldn't help but view the members of the Watch as shallow cartoon characters. Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill tap into their trademark onscreen personas, so either you like their patented traits or you don't. Either you like Costco or you don't. Either you like exploding cows or you don't.

4765851,4,B005LAII2Q,"The Watch is one of those films where initially you believe it's going to be an extremely awful comedy due to the awkward, rushed, and unfunny jokes constantly blurting all over the place without any rhyme or reason (Vince Vaughn being an extra talkative sex-obsessed moron the biggest culprit of any awkwardness to the storyline flow) but, believe it or not, there actually *are* several moments of science fiction concerning an alien invasion later on during the final 20 minutes.

It's about Ben Stiller's character finally saying enough is enough when an employee of his working night shift at Costco's is brutally murdered by an alien, so he comes up with this idea to recruit a few others and start up a neighborhood watch.  It's basically a group of misfits that have no desire to actually be part of a neighborhood watch and refuse to take the job seriously, so they sit (or cruise) around town making jokes about any sexual-related thing you can imagine.  If you dislike any of this, it's undoubtedly because of Vince Vaughn's character.  He's relentless with the jokes.

Now it's not just the sex jokes themselves that one could easily have a problem with- it's the way they deliberately ruin the flow of the storyline.  You see some viewers are probably tuning into the Watch to see science fiction aspects but... they certainly won't like the inappropriate words coming out of Vince's mouth.  Hey I can hardly blame them either.  Constantly comparing green alien gunk to... you-know-what, is pretty gross.  Sometimes however, the obnoxious and immature nature of the neighborhood watch group manages to be funny (such as, to name one example, after a kid is caught throwing eggs at the neighborhood watch, he's quickly caught and brought to the downtown police station where the neighborhood watch feels the need to question the kid themselves in their own oddball way- a few funny moments occur here).

Rather surprisingly, the storyline improves (and turns serious) later on when it's realized that aliens are actually here on earth and planning to destroy all human life.  The aliens themselves are pretty dangerous.  It's sort of funny watching the aliens throw humans across the room so they slam into walls.  Also when the aliens hide behind store aisles when the fight eventually spills out to Costco's, these are more entertaining segments.  The scenes with Ben Stiller and his wife and the realization that Ben doesn't have the ability to have children are utterly pointless, as are the ones with Vince Vaughn's daughter being disagreeable for the sake of acting like a typical teenager and going to parties despite her father not approving of her lifestyle.  These are awful.  However, how about when Ben and the boys find a helmet that can allow them to blow things up?  Awesome!  I mean *seriously* blow things up in the most explosive way imaginable!

The humor... certainly an acquired taste.  I personally wouldn't blame anyone if they hated the awkward way the storyline is deliberately sabotaged in favor of oddly utilized sex jokes.  You've been warned.",1367020800,,3083,4.970760233918129

4765995,4,B005LAII2Q,I thought this movie was going to be absolutely aweful. It actually was decent! It was entertaining. It kept my attention. Had some decent plot line. Def. some funny jokes. It's worth a watch for sure.,1364083200,,201,4.611111111111111
4765996,5,B005LAII2Q,I thought that this movie was pretty good. it could of been better but i still liked it. i love the characters. ben stiller and vince vaughn were hilarious and so was jonah hill. i thought that the alien effects were awesome. the aliens looked pretty cool. and i thought it was funny that thier hive was in a costco. all in all if you want to relax and have a good laugh and see cool aliens then this movie will do that for you. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1363996800,,484,4.0

There was stupid sex stuff though, so I wouldn't feel comfortable watching it with him.  S&M orgy scene, alien jiz jokes.  Bleh.  It would've been watchable without that, but also the other jokes could've been better. Pretty base humor.  We typically like stupid stuff, but this was even below our level.",1363824000,,434,4.584415584415584

4766050,5,B005LAII2Q,"The movie is fun to watch. I watched it without any expectations. I didn't know what it was or would be about. i guessed. I was wrong. It's about friends, being alone in reality (when you think you have everything, but you don't) and of course, aliens. The movie is very well tied together with goddamn great plot, dialogue and actors. If there was one thing I disliked it's the actor that played a douche bag, simply because he seemed like one. I enjoyed the movie, great special effects and humor. To some people the use of sexual content and swearing may be a little too much. I wouldn't say it was too much. While it's not the first movie about aliens, I think it was a very good comedy with great looking creatures. No bad or cheap CGI animations in here. You should try the movie, it's quite good! I myself will watch it again when the time comes! I know it's hard to please everyone, there will always be unsatisfied people, but to give THIS movie 1 stars? That's just stupid. It doesn't deserve that many bad reviews and whatever 1 star reviewers will say, I will still recommend it!",1363564800,,1091,4.405940594059406

I was in the room as the movie started and from the beginning couldn`t get away.  For a 2012 comedy, very little vulgarity-  and what there was was often tongue in cheek.  The characters are classics;  prototypes of prototypical American men  (and that weirdo Brit). The pace was fast enough for my boys. The movie has a couple of ""moral"" lessons which one can ignore if they choose, bits of intrigue, and lots of out-of-context American snapshots of some of the States more irrational habits..

This movie was missing a bit of the warmth and charm that made Dodgeball so funny. However, this is still worth watching. The acting is all decent throughout with everyone getting at least one good moment.  Although, Richard Ayoade (IT Crowd) is the stand out here I think.

4767141,1,B005LAII2Q,"The Watch is one bad movie, it's badly made, badly performed, poorly directed, left wondering in search of it's self.  It is also tasteless in it's approach to humor and  how it handles it's violence, it is just down right one of the least pleasurable experiences that you are bound to have this year. Already known for it's last minute title change from ""Neighborhood Watch"", to avoid connections in audiences minds with the recent Trayvon Martin shooting. This movie could have been a welcomed timed comment on the violent nature and the dumbing down of society, but instead it is a whole hog embracing of it.

Ben Stiller stars as Evan, your average Costco employee, this is an embarrassing movie long advert for the chain store, who forms a local neighborhood watch after the mysterious death of a friend. He recruits pals Bob (Vince Vaughn) and Franklin (Jonah Hill), and newcomer Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade). Together they discover the problem isn't local gangs, vandals or sex-crazed neighbors, but a full scale alien invasion.

Stiller plays his usual tightly wound character here, a character that is becoming annoying and loosing much interest. Still, Stiller fares better than co-stars Vaughan who's persona has never been  more obnoxious than it is here and the usually reliable Hill as a gun totting misfit/loser/reject is more than a bit creepy.

Written by Seth Rogen (who wisely does not appear in the film, not even an unbilled cameo!) along with Jared Stern and Evan Goldberg, this mix of sophomoric humor and straight foreword alien terror fails miserably at every step. Usually, I'm all over horror-comedy mesh-ups, especially when the frights are played straight as they are here. However, the attempted gross out humor is just not funny, it's aimed at the ten or twelve year-old boy level. For example the aliens' brains are literally in their penises, now if that kind of thing gets you falling down laughing than this is for you, but if you are like most people and have outgrown that level of sophistication you will not have a very good time with the Watch.

Tracking at a dismal 13% on the tomato meter over at rotten tomatoes.com, and already a commercial failure. Only sporadically where there any laughs from the audience I saw it with, and even fewer occasions by your humble reviewer. At a painful 102 minutes long, this is just too much to bare for any self-respecting, and most likely paying, moviegoer.

""Spoiler"" It is yet another story where aliens come to earth and they are evil monkeys. I wish they did it like 21 Jump Street and made the threat be distracted by the incompetent heroes and then busted.  Also the aliens were ridiculous.

Granted, you can't go in expecting an amazing piece of cinematic art. If you want that, go to Sundance. It is a comedy, have fun with it.",1358899200,,508,4.1313131313131315

Don't watch this if potty humor offends you. They talk about all sorts of ""gross"" stuff that I can totally see a lot of more conservative viewers not enjoying.

4767778,4,B005LAII2Q,"Glenview, Ohio is a peaceful and quiet town that is just full of nice people. At least most of them are people! Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is the senior manager of the local Costco store and he is involved in almost every community club in town. He should be as he is the person who started most of them. One evening his night watchman is brutally murdered at work.  Evan is outraged as the police seem to not be actively involved in finding the murderer and he starts a local neighborhood group called the Watch to keep an eye out over the neighborhoods to try to solve the murder and prevent other crimes.

His group only attracts 3 other members who are Franklin (Jonah Hill), Bob (Vince Vaughn) and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade).  As Evan tries to organize this madcap group of misfits into a professional watch organization they uncover a sinister plot in Glenview to take over not only the city but the entire world....

This movie is a hilarious comedy and my wife and I enjoyed it.  It does contain a lot of crude language and sexual content so it is not advisable for children and it is rated R. The storyline is a funny Sci-Fi twist where the Watch team is aware of aliens invading the city with a plot to do even more.  It is up to them to figure out what the plan is while also taking care of their own personal lives.  There are a lot of funny one line jokes but they are mingled in with many crude language comments that seem to detract to the story line.  (it was overdone)

The cast of actors is very good and the talent of the stars carries the movie. The script is weak and depends too much of vulgar jokes instead of comedic innovation that such a powerful cast could have easily pulled off.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is worth watching but I would probably rent it as I can't see someone watching it more than one time.  It is funny and has a lot of good parts in the movie.  Just make sure that you are not offended by the crude language and that your children are not in the room.",1357862400,,2020,4.231770833333333

As expected, all of Jonah Hill's jokes surround the subject of the male member, which are most of the time unnecessary and not funny.  Vince Vaughn definitely stole the show as his usual fast-talking character.  Richard Ayeoade brought his entertaining awkward geeky-ness from The IT Crowd, which you can't help but love!!!

4767965,1,B005LAII2Q,"Hard to watch movie, called ""The Watch"" describes what you will be doing throughout most of this feature length film-Watching your Watch.  One wonders how this script was even accepted.  Even with the like of Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill (I love these 3 comic geniuses) there really is no point to the film.  There is an ongoing subplot with Ben Stiller and his wife (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) not being able to get pregnant (goes nowhere), Jonah Hill is a cop wanna be that lives at home (predicable).  You can guess how the story will play out, but the ride should at least be fun.  It isn't.",1357430400,,593,4.5046728971962615

4768074,2,B005LAII2Q,"Have any of you ever been to Gleview, Ohio? No? Let me tell you something... you're gonna want to go there. It's sunny, the people are friendly and don't even get me started on all of the activities. SO MANY ACTIVITIES! And guess what else? There's a Costco. Yep, a geniune Costco! I love Costco and coincidentally so does the Store Manager, Evan. Glenview is near perfect, well, it is until Costco's trusty night watchman ends up brutally murdered. Evan doesn't take kindly to murderers killing off his staff and defiling his store, so he does what any rational human being would do in this situation--he forms a neighborhood watch. The watch consisting of Evan, Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus make it their mission solve Antonio's murder. But soon several more of Glenview's trusty residents go missing and all evidence points to aliens as the culprit. With these four eclectic suburbanites as Glenview's only remaining hope, is everyone doomed to succumb to the pending invasion?

With regard to The Watch, you're far better off reading my excellent summary than purchasing it. At least I managed to make it sound somewhat entertaining, right? Okay, perhaps I'm embellishing the terriblness of the flick just a little, but it really is bad. Lucky for me, my expectations radar was set to tickle rather than stun, so I didn't have to worry about disappointment or anything. So, yeah, that's a plus. This is yet another one of those not-funny-movies that has marginally funny people in it. You have Vince Vaughn being a total jerk (basically himself), Jonah Hill doing a pitiful portrayal of a bad boy and Ben Stiller doing the""I'm a nice guy who inadvertently gets caught up in crazy hijinks"" thing. SNOOZE. The real people to watch are Will Forte and the rest of the supporting cast. And I can't forget Richard Ayoade. He's hilarious. In fact, watch Flight of the Concords, it's so much better. Okay, back to the movie. Unsurprisingly, it's a total raunchfest, and honestly, I've seen one too many of those lately.

The utter ridiculousness isn't the only thing that had me smacking my head on the table. They dangle this tantalizing science fictiony ""we are already among you, living as you"" carrot in front of you and THEY TOOK IT NOWHERE! Yeah. Basically all of the potentially decent sci-fi stuff was a total red herring. GAH! Here's an idea. Let ME remake the movie. I'm being serious! And look movie producer guys, I'll make this easy for you. We don't have to recast any of it. That's right, we'll keep all the same actors. Just let me put those super exposive ray gun thingys to better use and bring the tone down to the likes of The Faculty or Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Now we've got ourselves a real movie! What do you say? You better act soon! My services are running at a discount (which I attribute solely to the holiday spirit). Have we got a deal?

Food for Thought: The Watch, as a sci-fi film, is just what you'd expect: unremarkable. As a comedy it's sparse and spotty, relying more on the street cred of the comedic actors in it than on the actual comedy itself. There are, however far and few between, funny moments thanks mostly in part to Richard Ayoade and Will Forte. I have to say, The Watch is a rental at most and best viewed while otherwise distracted by delicious sugar plumbs (are those things even real?) or preferably inhebriated off your perpetually drunk uncle's fabulously strong eggnog.",1357171200,,3427,4.7370184254606365

4768411,4,B005LAII2Q,"There was only one thing I knew about The Watch that had me wanting to see it before I even saw the trailer, and that was Richard Ayoade. I have long been a huge fan of the UK comedy series The IT Crowd which Ayoade stars in. The man is a comic genius, and I didn't care what The Watch was about, I was just eager to see one of the funniest character actors I've seen in a long time in a mainstream picture.

The film takes place in a cookie-cutter American suburb of Glenview, Ohio. Evan (Ben Stiller) is manager at the local Costco, who's overcompensates for his male insecurities by taking part in countless clubs and activities, anything but spending time with his hot wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt). Things get shaken up when Evan's friend and Costco security guard, Antonio (Joe Nunez), is suspiciously murdered one night in the store. Evan's solution is to create a new club: the Neighborhood Watch.

Evan attracts only a few eager volunteers: Bob (Vince Vaughn), the man's man looking for some buddies to party with; Franklin (Jonah Hill), the police academy flunky; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade). the quirky and mysterious British lad. The group of misfits get off to a rough start with the watch, which mostly turns into an excuse for most of the guys to drink and get away from their personal troubles. Just as Evan loses hope for the group, they come across a curious lead whilst on patrol one night.

The film then takes a rather unexpected turn. I'd say that turn is rather silly, but it really is on par with the whole movie leading up to it. From the opening scene I knew what I was in for with this film. The raunchy and idiotic comedy driven by sex, beer, racism and other standards of film's in its class is abundant. This genre isn't particularly my forte, but every now and then, one of these moronic comedies is a good change of pace to just let loose.

The characters lack depth, we don't really care about them, and the story is so incredibly zany and silly that it feels like the everything is just drawn in with disregard for coherence. But honestly, that seems like exactly what they set out to do with this film. It's a silly comedy about a bunch of guys, each with their own issues, who wind up in a sci-fi plot. And to be honest, I laughed like crazy. As I said, every now and then it's good to just check your mind at the door. I was due for a nonsense comedy with a wild story and wacky characters, and The Watch delivered. And of course, Richard Ayoade is the icing on the cake with his signature brand of humor.

Some good story ideas, but not a lot of laughs. A lot of chasing and shooting and sex talk and beer drinking and shooting and chasing and bad language. It does have an R rating, but like I said, not really date night stuff. But if you are male and still have an adolescent fascination with bodily functions and fluids and like to play violent video games - you just might enjoy this one!

This steaming pile of Hollywood puke was atrocious. I laughed a couple times in the beginning, but halfway through decided I'd give it a little more time before I'd shut it off. The sad thing is (like a lot of films) this one had potential. I thought I just might enjoy it... and was sadly mistaken. I like the African-Englishman from 'The IT Crowd' and a little Vince Vaughn never did any harm but this thing couldn't be saved by anybody. I actually ended up falling asleep 15 minutes before it ended, still had the rest of the day to finish it, but just didn't want to waste those 15 more minutes. The script was horrible, the jokes were terrible (very childish/disgusting bits of humor, which can be enjoyed if delivered the right way.. 'Bridesmaids' comes to mind in that department) This movie failed. It let me down.. Don't let it waste your afternoon as it did mine. Don't even rent it from red box. The worst comedy since... I can't remember a worse comedy.

4769439,5,B005LAII2Q,"The only down-side to this movie is that it comes across (pardon the pun) with sex, semen and sex pistol. Stiller and Vaughn movies have always had a similar focus. A little bit too much for me, and this movie takes it up another few notches. So, don't watch it at the next family get together, with that special someone you just met, your kids or your grandparents.

It is a GUY movie. It is a Buddy Movie packed with some sci fi/horror/action elements. It is extremely well acted and executed. It has a nice budget behind the special effects and the aliens. It is kinda weird in parts, and down-right disgusting in others.

Apparently, a lot of folks couldn't get past some of the more squeamishly homo innuendos and focus on the male genitalia. I don't know what others have been watching, but this is par for the course in this genre. From Adam Sandler and Kevin James, to Harold and Kumar, to Pineapple Express and Hangover ---Hollywood likes to make it's pro-homosexual point. And it like to get laughs with very base, gutter, and toilet humor.

Frankly, I found ""Harold and Kumar Go to Gitmo"" much more ""offensive"" than this movie. And ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" was way over the top. These movies are made to appeal to older teens and college kids who laugh at certain words being said on TV or in a movie, even if it's Buddy addressing Dick Van Dyke on the old TV comedy.

While this kind of college humor is not appealing to me, I did find a lot to laugh at. As for the movie in and of itself, putting the unfortunate penis-focus aside, it is worth seeing. If that stuff offends you, then skip it.",1355529600,3,1618,4.419463087248322

Turns out, there were 3 good laughs through the whole movie and most of them were really cheap.

In more detail what was sad about the movie:

-Vince Vaughn's creepy obsession with his daughter's sex life.
-Play on stereotypes is offensive nowhere near funny.
-Too many penis jokes to count... not creative either
-The plot is unfortunate and not in a remotely interesting way.
-There are others, but going into further detail would be a play by play of the movie.

In fact, before sitting down to watch it I had it in my head that because everyone in the movie has already established themselves as being capable actors in the area of comedy that my expectations would exceed the acting as well as the movie itself.  I can very truthfully say that the movie far surpassed what I thought its ability to make me laugh would be. These four actors have a really very good comedic chemistry together and NONE of the acting felt strained. At no time in ANY part of the movie did I feel like they were going for laugh...I mean to say that it felt very off the cuff and natural which is amazing considering it is a comedy AND about aliens wanting to destroy the earth at that.

DON'T be fooled by the previews!!! As I said, I did not watch this movie to the END! No matter how much you think that  Stiller+Vaughn = FUNNY... PLEASE RECONSIDER!!!  (Independently)Their previous movies were funny, so I gave this one a chance (way longer than I SHOULD have).
If I was only going to watch a stupid, mindless, funny movie with usually FUNNY actors, ALONE w/ ONLY ADULTS in the room... I MAY have watched the WHOLE movie. BUT, since I was watching w/ my teens, I have to say the language/vulgarity/absurdity was ABSOLUTELTY DISGUSTING!!!

4770131,3,B005LAII2Q,I liked the movie but its different type of comedy I'm used to coming from these two actors. This movie is about space aliens trying to takeover our planet? Science fiction?

Vince Vaughn is the typical manic, cocky, guys guy- but he always pulls it off. Ben Stiller plays the average joe manager of a Costco.

Surely, much better than that movie.

Anyways, I feel like someone MAYBE wrote like half of this movie on some index cards, threw the index cards at these actors and then just filmed them with a lot of expensive sets and CGI.....AND I LOVED IT!

Funny but I thought Jonah Hill, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and IT crowds Richard Ayoade were pretty in tuned with each other when making this movie.
It's not a serious sci-fi flick (obviously) but it's not exactly low budget just low brow (the production was decent just don't expect AVP).
I also found many moments to be completely hysterical more so then some reviewers may lead you to believe.
Speaking of which how are this many people against this movie? In this day and age if you don't know what to expect from a Stiller & Vaughn collaboration joke wise then really stay away from comedies.
And the orgy thing, and the cursing really that bad was it? Hey go watch Jay and Silent Bob strike back, or even American Pie was pretty sleazy all around.
What made these people think this was gonna be the mold breaker?
Overall yes there's an orgy, yes swearing abundantly, yes cheesy lines abound and yes it all works for me.
And yes like in most comedies it ends with a neat little bow wrapped around itself.
So for those of you expecting to see a Stiller/Vaughn/Hill/Ayoade comedy that contains no lewd jokes or antics whatsoever then ya really past this and go watch Facts of Life or something.",1353888000,,1259,4.5506607929515415

In retrospect, it is much more of a success than Men in Black 3 could ever have been but it still suffers from a incoherent script with too many sidetracks toward crude sex jokes than actual storyline focused on an alien disaster but in many ways, it's more interesting that way just like what Paul (2011) with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost done the same thing to the sci-fi genre and Hot Fuzz done to the hard-to-the-knuckles action film genre.

My problems with the movie are (1) it's a 90 minute ad for Costco. Brand placement in film has reached annoying levels (2) The Watch contains mawkish subplots that have no business being in a sci-fi comedy. For example, Vaughn's character is trying to better connect with his daughter, while Stiller has breeding issues with his wife. It's like the miniseries V  intersecting with Thirtysomething. Can we have an alien invasion movie where the hero's ONLY focus is on saving the planet? If a guy is tasked with battling an army of intergalactic mutants, his defective man-goop would be the last thing on his mind. I still recommend The Watch though. It's good for a few big laughs.

4771342,5,B005LAII2Q,"This movie is bound to be a cult classic! I can't understand why it has been getting bashed. I have watched it already 5 times since my girlfriend bought it for me, and I still laugh my a** off at it.

Stiller plays the concerned citizen, who is the manager of a Costco store, and apparently likes to start alot of clubs. Even though Ben doesn't have alot of funny lines, he pulls off his part very well, and the funny lines he does get he hits the bullseye every time.

Vaughn plays the party guy/concerned father part, and he does a great job. He is by far the funniest character, and is back in top form (100 times better than his role in The Dilemma). The condom scene is just freakin hilarious.

Hill plays the wildcard, and that is exactly what he is. He just comes in at the most unexpected times, and hits his mark every time. Though this is not his funnest role, it is far from sucking.

Now onto Richard Ayoade who I have never heard of before this movie. He is awesome, and totally caught me by surprise. I guarantee you will repeat a few of his lines.

As for the story, I don't know what the haters were expecting from a alien comedy, but I thought the plot played out really well. There weren't no real big plot twists, but why should there be, it is a comedy.

The aliens look really good also, and the alien is played by Doug Jones, who has been in Pans Labyrinth as the Fawn, Hellboy as Abe Sapien, and the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four 2. He really understands latex suits and does a wonderful job at helping to bring the alien to life.

Overall, I really enjoy this movie, and love the fact that you can watch it over and over and still laugh, and these days it is hard to get a good bang for your buck, but that is exactly what this movie gives you.",1353628800,,1771,4.1759530791788855

Jona Hill had a minor role .. and again wasn't even funny .. he didn't really do much in this movie .. which was a dissappointment.  Ben Stiller was the biggest dissappointment though.  Even though yet again he played a neurotic weirdo I had higher expectations that he'd atleast hold this movie together.  I don't mind some raunchy topics as long as they are intermingled with some comedy.  This movie was just crude and rude .. which is apparently all hollywood is capable of anymore.

That's all you need to know about this movie, but for those that want more in depth.... this stars Ben Stiller as Evan, a do gooder in his own town, the manager of a Cost Co (get ready for product placements). After a strange attack late at night in his Cost Co left a night watchman uh.... I won't spoil it. The moronic police blame the citizens for not watching over their own town. So Evan / Ben takes it upon himself to start up a neighborhood watch with Bob / Vince Vaugn, Jonah Hill and the other guy. They all meet for the first time at the first watch meeting. Even if Vince and Jonah had been introduced earlier. Vince played the clueless father, Jonah played the super serious militant man and the fourth guy played the quirky dirty minded one. You've got all of the troupes here, even though I feel like Vince and Jonah should have been playing the different roles, but Jonah's age would get in the way.

Anyway, continuing on, by what feels like sheer luck, the discover clues that aliens are in their town. Sheer luck like hitting an alien with an SUV. The plot gets derailed very easily and it feels like fluff meant to pad out the movie. Everything that makes this movie entertaining was in the trailer in the order it is in the trailer.

The film is another failed attempt to mix paranormal with comedy that hardly works (GHOSTBUSTERS being the exception), and we've seen Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, etc., play variations of these types of characters so many times in other films that they seem to be morphing into each other.

Special effects were pretty good, music was well done, and the cinematography were all fine.  As a movie it works.

4771596,4,B005LAII2Q,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

I've never been a huge fan of Ben Stiller, but I love Jonah Hill and I find Vince Vaughn to be oddly entertaining. So with this movie I wasn't really sure what to expect. I wasn't setting the bar too high. All I really wanted was to enjoy myself and that's what the end result was. From start to finish I was laughing and just having a good time.

After watching this I feel safe in saying that this is 100% a dude film. There's a lot of comedy, there's aliens, there's action, a couple of breasts thrown in there. It's a good time. I wasn't really expecting the story to involve aliens, but it ended up working out. Ben Stiller gave a normal Ben Stiller performance, it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill on the other hand... wow! These two were hilarious in here! Then there's Richard Ayoade, someone I've never heard of prior to watching this, who gave a surprisingly good performance.

What this film does well is embrace the fact that it's weird. I was expecting it to be a group of friends that were forced into doing this neighborhood watch, but it's the complete opposite. You have Evan Trautwig (Stiller) who wants to start the watch after someone is murdered. So he tries to get people interested enough to sign up. However, the only three people who show up are Bob McAllister (Vaughn), Franklin (Hill), and Jamarcus (Ayoade). Bob wants to join because he thinks it's going to be a group of guys getting together to hang out and get away from their wives, Franklin is just messed up in the head and wants to take out his frustration, and Jamarcus is someone who is recently divorced that wants to make some new friends. I recently read that Chris Rock was originally planned for Jamarcus, that would've been amazing! Sadly, it didn't happen. Either way these four have great chemistry on screen which makes for a very entertaining experience.

Overall Score: 8/10 - This film is far from perfect, and it can be corny at times, but in the end it's a good time. There's a lot of comedy and just the right amount of action so you don't have time to notice how amateur-ish these action scenes are.

4771675,2,B005LAII2Q,". . .  this movie is a dud.  And I say this as someone who likes the screen presence of Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn pretty much regardless of what the film is about.  But Stiller and Vaughn are not enough to save this film.  It's poorly written.  It's has a poor screen play.  It has a weird subplot about Ben Stiller's character being infertile that has nothing to do with anything else in the film and if I had to guess I would say it was only included in the film to setup Vaughn's character for a string of one liners about dead sperm.  And there are scene after extended scenes of the main characters just riffing on each other as if they shot these guys doing improv and then cobbled together the best insults from one of their sessions and edited them into the film.  It feels strained and staid the whole way through.  The plot is awful and barely thought through.  And by the way- this film might as well be a giant ad for Costco.  It really feels like this movie was paid for by a Costco marketing division.  And not a big thing- but I found it very distracting- was Stiller's makeup.  It looks like his face is covered in crust it is so thick.  I felt sorta cheated by this sloppy hackish production.  I expect better out of Stiller and Vaughn.

The only way I could recommend this film is if you like Vince Vaughn enough to see him deliver some good one liners in a movie that otherwise is awful.  His character and performance is the only thing that held my interest.",1352505600,,1481,4.250896057347671

4771679,2,B005LAII2Q,"""The Watch"" is the story of Costco manager and community go-getter Evan (Ben Stiller), who decides the town needs a civilian patrol.  He starts a Neighborhood Watch, enlisting Bob (Vince Vaughn), who just wants to get out of the house; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a rejected applicant for the local police force; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a frizzy-haired guy of vague ethnicity.

""The Watch"" fails in its predictable, awkward attempt to blend assorted genres into a laugh riot.  The script by Seth Rogen, Jared Stern, and Evan Goldberg is a fruitless attempt to milk gags from an idea that might have looked better on paper than it does on screen.  Director Akiva Schaffer is adrift in trying to bring that script to comic life, with many scenes looking amateurish.

Stiller's blank look is supposed to get laughs, but he comes off as rigid and unamusing.  A subplot involving his sexual difficulties with his wife, Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), might account for his disengaged demeanor, but hardly generates laughter.

Hill recycles his nerdy shnook character from many earlier films and struggles to be funny, but is fighting the sub-par script, while Ayoade attempts to get laughs from describing his character's sexual fantasies.  Vaughn carries most of the comedy weight in ""The Watch.""  His rapid-fire delivery, childlike suggestions, and innocent desire to have fun with the boys are honest and believable.  Even when the script isn't there to support him, he manages to forge ahead, substituting body language, facial expression, and that rat-tat-tat delivery for clever dialogue.

The final third of the movie is filled with CGI special effects.  These days, viewers take for granted the marvels of computer-generated imagery, so creepy, slimy, fast-moving ET's that ooze green blood aren't enough to salvage this pedestrian effort.

4771680,5,B005LAII2Q,"I risked the bad reviews and ended up loving it. If you like 80s horror/sci-fi comedy you will love this. It was like the movie ""Slither"" ""Night of the Creeps""  ""The Lost Boys""  and ""21 jump street"" all rolled into one.

The purpose of this movie is to entertain. It achieves that in spades. The critics are too jaded and cynical for these types of films.

There are a few plot holes but nothing that ruined the fun for me. Also I felt that a lot of Vince Vaughn's lines were NOT funny at all. It came off as pointless dialogue.  Still his subplot was funny and grounded the movie a bit. He gets better as the movie goes on.

Other than that though it was just a straight up fun movie.  Guys bonding and doing cool stuff together, suddenly thrust into an extraordinary situation. Lots of interesting subplots with good pay offs. The whole movie just had a good mixture of action, comedy, sci fi, and heart.

As with all horror/sci-fi comedies its not gonna be loved by the mainstream. Why do you think movies like this are rare? They were huge in the 80s and I for one appreciate them.

This is a good movie to watch with your buddies. I bought it on a gamble and it totally payed off this time.

5 stars for sure. At the very least rent it.",1351814400,2,1241,4.242553191489361
4771711,3,B005LAII2Q,"The Watch (formerly titled Neighborhood Watch until the PC-police arrived) draws easy comparisons to Ghostbusters and it has the comedic energy; it just doesn't really go anywhere. It's been absolutely pummeled by critics but the typical audience in the movie's demographic will likely find something enjoyable about it. Despite a script co-written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, it would almost be a total failure without the comedic skill of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade. If you enjoy their comedic stylings, a line or two will please you but the laughs are underwhelming and often repetitive.

In the small town of Glenview, Ohio, Evan (Stiller) is the senior manager of a local Costco store and an active member in his community. He's your typical overzealous suburbanite. One night a security guard at Costco is killed under mysterious circumstances and Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. He recruits only 3 people; loud and animated Bob (Vaughn), sociopathic Franklin (Hill), and inexplicably British Jamarcus (Ayoade). With Evan dedicating much of his energy to finding the killer he's angered by the other three using the watch as an outlet for camaraderie. Things change when the four find a mysterious orb...and the alien(s) who brought it here.

The Watch is rated `R' largely due to the vulgar humor that's in the same vein as Superbad, The Sitter, and the average Apatow-clan movie. This humor occurs in the context of a sci-fi action film, with a level of alien-related violence a step above the Men in Black series. The premise isn't very fresh, but it's one where you can snugly fit a solid cast and situational humor that the script ultimately fails to deliver. The script is essentially a series of humorless events that give the actors a chance to improvise humorous dialogue, with an unnecessary subplot involving a character's impotence that brings nothing to the movie.

When The Watch works, it's often in small increments. The humor is far from high-brow (the scene that made me laugh the most is about as far from that term as you can get), but that isn't the problem. I don't need jokes that will change my life; I just need jokes that will make me laugh consistently. I laughed a few times, but only sporadically and the only reason I remained consistently amused was the natural ability of the principal cast. The filmmakers owe all the success and humor to them.

One of the funniest moments is R. Lee Ermey's appearance as an irate man who confronts the neighborhood watch. The uncredited Billy Crudup also amuses as Evan's creepy neighbor who the watch suspects may be an alien. I've always found Vaughn's deadpan and caffeinated ranting funny and he provided some of my favorite comedic moments. There's a sequence where the guys have taken a dead alien back to Vaughn's house and begin taking pictures with it (many of them inappropriate). There's nothing original about this scene, but it's so ludicrous and the four actors work so well together I couldn't help but laugh.

I admit to some bias. Because I like Vaughn, Hill, and Stiller it may be easier for me to find enjoyment in this than the average viewer. Vaughn has the ability to stare directly into the camera and make me laugh. However, with the talent present here, this movie should have been much better. It was never a movie looking for critical accolades; it's just supposed to be a dumb, funny movie. Unfortunately it's dumb more than it's funny. Many will greet The Watch with enthusiasm and declarations of ""the critics are stupid!"" Many will greet it with an open-mind, hate it, and take out their hatred on the IMDB message boards with jokes about Jonah Hill's physique. Whatever the case, The Watch isn't boring but it is forgettable and not necessarily worth watching.",1351814400,4,3813,4.896284829721362
4771712,4,B005LAII2Q,"I actually cringed when I watched the Trailer of this movie.  It looked like the worst piece of garbage movie ever created.  Honestly, whoever pieced together that Trailer should never, ever find work in Hollywood ever again.  The Trailer for this movie didn't do it justice.

I was 100% expecting to turn the movie off within 30 minutes, tops.  I expected it to be horrible, pretty much unwatchable, because that's what the Trailer lead me to believe.  In actuality, the movie was actually pretty good.  It had a number of 'laugh out loud' moments.  A number of moments were so funny, that my sides began to hurt.  Yes, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller played predictable characters.  Don't they always?  But even so, I still find their movies entertaining, regardless of their recurring roles.

If you're stuck on a movie to rent, and you immediately dismissed this movie like I did, because of the Trailer, think again.  The movie is actually a pretty decent comedy.  3 1/2 stars, which I'll round up to 4 stars, because of how pleasantly surprised I was, that it wasn't absolutely horrible.",1351728000,3,1090,4.790322580645161
4771713,2,B005LAII2Q,"How much do you love your community? Would you join every civic organization whose goals you support and start your own, if necessary? Would you risk your life defending it?

  Evan Trautwig (played by Ben Stiller) is the most civic-minded member of his hometown of Glenview, OH. As a member of most local community organizations and founder of several, Evan (Stiller) somehow manages to balance all that, a wife, and a job managing the local Costco. When the night watchman, his friend, is murdered, he then starts the one community organization that his town surprisingly does not have: a neighborhood watch. Despite posting signs all over Glenview to alert the citizenry of their first meeting, only three men show up. Bob Finnerty, father and construction worker, Franklin, who had hoped to join the police but was rejected, and Jamarcus who is recently divorced. Finnerty (played by Vince Vaughn) shows no interest in safeguarding the community and uses the watch as an excuse to get out of the house. Franklin (played by Jonah Hill) sees the watch as an opportunity to show up those on the police force who rejected him and engage in acts of vigilantism. Jamarcus (played by Richard Ayoade) is simply looking to meet people while entertaining the possibility that a lonely, attractive, housewife might call the watch for assistance and seduce him. Whatever their differences, they're all shocked when they discover the violent attack that inspired Trautwig to found the watch was perpetrated by aliens.

  I've said it before; I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller. Almost all of his movies are exactly the same. That's only become clearer since he decided the Meet the Parents franchise needed a third, even more ridiculous, installment. As for Vince Vaughn, I've liked some of his work. Not all, maybe not even most, but some. While I don't always like the films themselves, Jonah Hill is always entertaining. I'm not familiar with Ayoade, but he was competent, to say the least. Still, they were stupid characters in an all too familiar situation. Cheap laughs with no originality. Enjoyable, perhaps, but completely forgettable.",1351641600,2,2129,5.034090909090909

Weird things start happening and the new Neighborhood Watch decided to take matters in their own hands.  I won't say what was happening, but it was not at all what I expected!  The movie has some definite fun parts that really made me laugh and I would probably watch it again.

(TOP 500 REVIEWER)  (REAL NAME)

This review is from: The Watch (DVD)
After the night watchman (Joe Nunez) at Costco was brutally murdered and his skin removed, Evan (Ben Stiller) forms a neighborhood watch in his peaceful Glenvue, Ohio community. Unfortunately not many people show up to join the group and all have their own reasons and issues.

Evan- Costco manager. Very straight and needs to be in charge. Takes things seriously, but doesn't take care of business with his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt).

Bob- (Vince Vaughn) Likes to drink and share his man-cave with his friends. Has a teenage daughter (Erin Moriarty) he keeps his eye on.

Franklin- (slimmed down Jonah Hill) Has the best lines. He quit school to become a policeman. He failed the written exam, physical, and the mental health screening. Wants to be a vigilante. Lives at home with his mother. Couldn't help think about George Zimmerman and Richard Jewel.

Jamarcus- (Richard Ayoade) He is from England and has a Korean girl fantasy.

The four guys are considered a joke. When they discover the aliens, they get up for the task.

I loved the use of the classic rock sound track which included The Doors, J. Geils Band, and Chris Cross who provided a laugh as the phone tone for the salty R. Lee Ermey. The humor rolls with the lines like when Bob asks Franklin, ""You failed the police exam, is this illegal?""

There was a lot of good humor. Unfortunately there was a lot of unnecessary crude humor, as the story was funny without it. It didn't need cheap laughs.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs galore. Brief sex and nudity.",1345334400,8,1669,4.724137931034483
4771719,1,B005LAII2Q,"I wish I could give this zero stars. Let's start this way, guess which actor plays which character? One is an overly verbose and touchy manchild. One is a weirdo outcast. One is an overly positive uptight square. If you guessed Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller, you'd be right, because these actors have played these exact same characters many times before. Here's the thing, I liked Wedding Crashers, I liked 21 Jump Street and Meet The Parents. They're funny movies. But stuffing those characters into what amounts to a 2-hour advertisement for Costco wrapped inside a wildly predictable plot.

The only positive to this movie was the performance of Richard Ayoade, who has a nice deadpan delivery to a couple of his lines. I actually felt bad that a talented actress like Rosemarie DeWitt had to lower herself to such a trainwreck, but I guess actors need to work.",1344816000,6,875,4.7947019867549665
4771720,2,B005LAII2Q,"""The Watch"" has been through numerous changes, rewrites, setbacks and problems throughout its history. In fact, the movies development began four years ago in 2008. It was supposed to be a ""Ghostbuster"" thingy. It was at one point supposed to star and be directed by Will Ferrell. Then it went without a Director for a long while. Finally Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg came in to rewrite and SNL's Akiva Schaffer came in to direct. Then the Trayvon Martin shooting happened, and the movie about a group of Neighorhood Watch men faced another challenge. The marketing scheme had to be dramatically changed.

Based on all of these hurdles, ""The Watch"" is not a bad movie. It is gifted with some pretty good humor from the talents of Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Richard Ayoade and Jonah Hill. Ultimately though, the movie could have been so much better. The premise is outstanding. When Ben Stiller's character, Evan Trautwig, is greeted with a gruesome murder scene when he comes to his job at Cosco one morning, he decides to start a neighborhood watch team in order to save his beautiful, friendly and peaceful community. The band-of-misfits are clueless what they will eventually be up against.

Despite three years of development though, the numerous collaborators either left out a lot of creative stuff, had to edit out a lot of creative stuff or overlooked the fact that their movie was in desperate need of something more unique. Too much of the movie relied upon the bitter-batter of its stars, which for the most part is funny, but gets old eventually. Enough time wasn't spent making ""The Watch"" something other than mediocre or run-of-the-mill.

We will probably not know what all happened to ""The Watch"" in its long process or what it could have been, but its ultimate outcome is pretty disappointing. It's too bad though because the humor in the movie is very funny. The actors worked well together, but given the premise of the movie, it should have been so much more than it was. All it ends up being, is a missed opportunity.",1344556800,,2038,4.800569800569801
