5559257,5,B00B5CTS3C,"NY Times Critic choice - read this review to see what they said...

Documentaries about disabilities don't come any smarter or more touching than Mission to Lars, a beautiful sibling road trip tale with a heavy-metal flourish.

Its about Tom Spicer, a British man with fragile X syndrome, which impairs cognitive and emotional functions, and his siblings, Kate and William, who are determined to help him fulfill his long-stated desire to meet Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica. Tom, whose disability can manifest itself in fixations of various kinds, doesnt say much, but one thing he has said endlessly over the years is Want to meet Lars.

So his brother and sister take him to the United States, where Metallica is touring, and make arrangements that they hope might get him a handshake from Mr. Ulrich. But Tom has been living in a group home; his siblings don't really know him well, and they have no idea of the challenges of traveling with someone with Toms disability. Routine is important to Tom, and such a trip disrupts his world so much that his defense mechanisms kick in, jeopardizing the whole effort.

So Mission to Lars is as much about Kate and Williams learning process as it is about Tom and the quest. They slowly come to appreciate their brothers challenges  for instance, an expert on fragile X explains to them that part of Toms trepidation about attending a concert is that for him, the sound is maybe 10 times louder than it is for you.

Do they ever overcome the obstacles and accomplish the mission? Its touch and go the whole way, but by the films end, we know one thing: Heavy-metal drummers can be surprisingly, movingly gracious.",1446595200,,1667,4.770833333333333
5559258,5,B00B5CTS3C,Very touching movie. Shows another side of Metallica specially Lars Ulrich. Me being a huge fan was really impress,1428451200,2,114,5.052631578947368
5559259,4,B00B5CTS3C,"Ummm... so this is a bit unexpected. Mission To Lars was good. I mean REALLY good. What we have here is a documentary about Kate (a journalist) and Will (a film maker) who feel guilty about neglecting their brother Tom (who has Fragile X syndrome - autism with bells on), and so embark on a quest to get him to America to meet his hero, Lars Ulrich.

The storytelling is deeply personal, as Tom struggles with the prospect of being removed from the safe environment of his care home, getting on a plane, and then travelling across the United States to meet Metallica's front man. And when he does.. WOW.

Lars turns out to be a thoroughly decent human being. Clearly he'd be briefed about Fragile X, but he is funny, engaging, understand - and he spends A LOT of time with Tom before a show, even letting him play on his drums.

Are there flaws to this film? Absolutely. Kate and Will are narcissistic self-centred know-it-alls who stubbornly ignore the advice that they're given, only to then wonder why their brother is acting out.

But the film is not about them - it's about Tom & Lars... and gave me a warm glow.
Well worth watching. 4/5",1388880000,6,1142,4.475961538461538

5559265,5,B00B5CTS3C,This movie sheds a light on a disease that was relatively unknown to me and shows the balance between disease and living a life. Metallica has been my favorite rock band for as long as I can remember and Lars went above and beyond anything I could have imagined with this very special fan. The documentary itself is a beautiful snippit of this special man and the struggle that he lives through on a daily basis.,1481068800,,412,4.434210526315789

5559300,5,B00B5CTS3C,"Maybe the most heart-wrenching as well as heart-warming thing I have seen in years. What seemingly starts out as an effort to relieve sibling guilt, turns into a all out cheer fest. I haven't rooted for any thing that hard since Rudy ran out of that tunnel. The anticipation at the end of this film could be cut with a knife...it is exactly what most films strive for. WELL DONE! I absolutely loved this film.",1464652800,,409,4.466666666666667

5559303,4,B00B5CTS3C,"Pretty good documentary! I am a big fan of Metallica, but had no idea this was made. Lars is such an awesome guy; just totally gets Tom's condition and works around it to give him the best time ever. 4/5 stars for some slow parts, and it wasn't edited the best, but these siblings aren't Academy Award nominated directors, so it's not a big let-down.

5559306,2,B00B5CTS3C,"Self-indulgent act by the siblings. They could have taken their brother to a show in UK and not dragged him halfway across the world when they knew he does not respond well to being removed from his routine. They simply wanted to make a movie and this was the subject.

Also, the movie ended at the climax, and did not provide any insight into how the brother settled into life after the show nor his reaction to meeting Lars.",1464566400,,426,4.3924050632911396
