Nevertheless, this is not a bad way to wile away your time without the need for intense involvement. We start with a failed attempt at a murder which has the look of a series of them which have recently occurred. The potential victim is a student of clinical psychiatry, which works nicely since the focus is on the psychological analysis of the attacker who believes he has lived many past lives. Has He? What is behind his beliefs. The plot unravels these hardly very tight knots with a bit of romance thrown in. Not among the better of the Clark based television films.",1306022400,2,666,4.605042016806722

7986627,3,B00008RV13,"I love Mary Higgins Clark books, and ordinarily I love the movies.  However, this particular movie was boring and the acting was mediocre.  Additionally, because there is no ""closed captioning"" it's very difficult to hear -- too many soft voices.  If I were you, I'd stick to the book.",1402272000,,285,4.775510204081633
7986628,3,B00008RV13,"I am a hard-core Mary Higgins Clark fan, and have read almost all her books.  I also like her movies, even if some of them are very amateur. However, Remember Me, While My Pretty One Sleeps, You Belong To Me, Let Me Call You Sweetheart and Moonlight Becomes You were very well done. I decided to purchase this DVD and as hard as I tried, it would not hold my interest.  In fact, it was a major disappointment and I would not recommend this particular DVD.",1375142400,4,455,4.27906976744186

7986631,3,B00008RV13,"I liked this movie. A college student is being stalked by a man that feels he has been with her in previous lifetimes. During one of the lifetimes she commited a murder. She blamed it on him and he was hung for it. ITS PAY BACK TIME.

If the possibility of reincarnation is interesting and you're open to the notion that we come back in many lifetimes to ""pay dues"" and learn from our errors, you will probably find this movie a good flick on Saturday night.

If you find this movie facinating or you are interested in other movies revolving around the idea of reincarnation, you will also like ""Midnight Bayou"".  This movie is excellent.",1328227200,2,638,4.482758620689655
