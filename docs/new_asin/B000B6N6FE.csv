2403505,5,B000B6N6FE,"This updated production of La Traviata, recorded live on Nov. 18, 2004 at the rebuilt Teatro La Fenice in Venice was the performance to reopen the opera season at the legendary theatre after its being destroyed by fire on the night of Jan. 29, 1996. It will stand in its own place among all the La Traviata's for its modern staging and refreshing perspectives. The fact that it used the original 1853 version that was world-premired at La Fenice would make the performance more significant, only that you wouldn't want history to repeat itself in respect to the opening night of La Traviata at La Fenice on May 6, 1853, which was, in Verdi's own words, ""a fiasco"". Robert Carsen's ambitious production, boasting the glittery nightclub scenes and design of large symbolic dollar bills (oddly with Verdi's image in the center) covering and hovering the stage, would certainly be under such risk, but pulled off amazingly thanks to the wonderful cast that takes up the challenge rigorously. As Robert Carsen wrote in the liner notes for the DVD, ""It is sometimes easy to forget that La Traviata is a story about a prostitute, albeit one at the top of her profession."" That well explains the bold approach in this production where elements of sex and money are conveyed not as subtly as one usually expects - right from the beginning, during Verdi's beautiful overture, one is reminded of both.

Patrizia Ciofi portrayed a passionate, struggling, and emotional honest Violetta, who would stay in one's mind long after the play is over. Her Violetta is well sung and deeply touching. With just the right vitality and vanity, she makes the role more compelling than other Violetta's I've seen. Roberto Sacca's Alfredo is adequately sung, but suffered from shortage of charisma in his acting. His tenor voice tends to wobble on the high notes. Hvorostovsky's Giorgio Germont is a father figure who has the strength that's all his own. The intensity of this character comes from his impeccable, smooth singing and nuanced acting (for one thing, he didn't slap the disobeying son). The great scene of Violetta and Giorgio Germont's duet in Act II is one of the many highlights of the night.",1131753600,13,2181,4.878706199460916
2403506,5,B000B6N6FE,"Robert Carsen's modern settting (1960s) for this opera works incredibly well largely because of the committed performances of the three principals: Ciofi is a very moving Violetta, Sacca a virile Alfredo and Hvorostovsky a powerful but nuanced Germont.  The updated sets and lighting succeed better here than in any other modern production of an opera that I have seen, even the giant one dollar bills floating down with Verdi's image on them.  Maazel leads an at times slow but powerful performance of the original score (which contains many interesting earlier and slightly fussy versions of Verdi's later reductions).  This DVD makes a fascinating comparison with the earlier classic, traditional La Fenice performance (Gruberova, Shicoff, Zancanaro and Rizzi); this too will become a classic.",1131148800,9,796,5.455284552845528

2403514,5,B000B6N6FE,"5 stars for Fleming's and Bruson's roles; 3 stars (sorry) for Villazon. Fleming's acting was stupendous; emotionally wrenching but her singing somewhat technically rushed in places...Renee Fleming once said that of all the roles she's played, Violetta was the one she identified the most as the embodiment of her operatic career and from her portrayal of Violetta's anguish, she has the part down superbly... I cried through most of the opera. Renato Bruson's portrayal of Giorgio Germount was equally powerful with his baritone still beautiful at his age ( I think he was 73 at this performance.) though (I felt) he could have given his voice more projection on stage. Bruson's portrayal of the loving father who only wanted the best for his two children was touching and dignified. I felt that he understood that Alfredo loved Violetta and that it would be hard for his son to leave her and therefore pleaded with Violetta to spurn him so he will come back home to his family. He sounded like a father who greatly missed his son. Now, for the first time EVER, I was disappointed in Villazon. For Rolando Villazon this was not his opera and Renee Fleming was not his Violetta. While his voice was in excellent form his acting skills were atrocious in the first ACT. It took him until ACT-II Scene- II to finally get into the role of Alfredo and not merely sing the part. I realize that from the stage, gestures have to be exaggerated to project emotion to the very back of the theatre but his gestures were melodramatic cliches and I was embarrassed for him as he over-acted the party scene in Act-I as he professes his secret love for Violetta. While he  wasn't overly dramatic later when he has his confrontation with his father, he still acts as if he does not seem to know how Alfredo is supposed to feel toward his father's words and his very expressive face gives him away. He finally redeems himself  in ACT-II scene II at Flora's party during the gambling scene by delivering his best acting and singing performance.. From that place onward in the opera to the final curtain he seemed to have finally found his Alfredo. This is not like him at all. Having watched him in Don Carlo, La Boheme, L'Elisir d' Amore( two directorial versions)  and Romeo et Juliette I would say that he is an excellent actor; able to  immerse himself into his characters but maybe it just wasn't so with this ensemble and in this Opera House. With all of the heavy singing parts for Fleming, La Traviata is primarily Violetta's opera so Villazon appears stiff and uncomfortable with Renee Fleming in the First and third Acts. Its not until he takes on the ACT II gambling scene that he realizes that this one was primarily about Alfredo and gets on with being present and being Alfredo.. He also acts like he is a little disappointed in the audience response to him compared to Renee Fleming's at curtain call. After receiving so many deafening ovations from the European opera houses his reception in LA seems a little lukewarm in comparison and his disappointment shows in his face. OR...Maybe he was just having a bad night...! Sorry my beloved Rolando, I can't give you a pass on this one, this was not your best work. Perhaps I need to buy and watch his  Anna Netrebko version of ""La Traviata"" with Thomas Hampson as the elder Germont. You have performed so many times with Anna, that the chemistry generally shows. I do that and let you guys know what I think of the Villazon/Netrebko version",1406332800,,3485,4.660162601626016

2403519,5,B000B6N6FE,This is one of the best La Traviata I own.  I have Ciofi in Lucie and I cannot describe her voice control during the mad scenes.  She is great.  Hvorostovsky is as good as well.,1359936000,,177,4.0
2403520,1,B000B6N6FE,"I looked with interest to watching Fleming in this role, but now that I've watched her I would say that this role is not a suitable vehicle for her. First of all, it's difficult to shine in this role when the soprano who gave its best rendition ever (Gheorghiu's 1994 ROH with Solti conducting) is still well and alive and performs it even now in her late forties. Second, there are issues of affinity, fit, and match, and Fleming and Violetta do not go well together. Third, she tends to be mannered, a problem that undermines her portrayal especially in the crucial act II. Fourth, not much of a chemistry with Villazon...

I like Fleming in Strauss and Mozart, but Verdi in general and Traviata in particular are not her thing.",1356307200,,730,4.572519083969466

2403522,5,B000B6N6FE,"When it comes to choosing one Traviata on DVD the clear front runners are this one and the more traditional Solti/Gheorghiu production from Covent Garden.  While Gheorghiu is magnificent, personally I do prefer this more imaginative production.  Not only that, but the singing is great and the sound superb.  Highly recommended, especially now that is out of print.",1355097600,,365,5.258620689655173

First about the DVD of Verdi's Traviata directed by Domingo and staring Rene Fleming. It is breathtakingly superb. No mincing, mannered posturing in the stage business and enchanting vocal performance.  Also, the supplier, Screaming CD experienced some difficulties with the post, but was professional and very accommodating and I would purchase from them again.

2403524,5,B000B6N6FE,Bought this as an alternate to viewing at a local auditorium. The staging was colorful and the singing was lush This is a good DVD for my library.,1339027200,,146,4.25
2403525,5,B000B6N6FE,The music is wonderful. The singers are moving with Rene' Fleming at the top of her game. The acting is appropriate and believable. Traviata is a favorite and I thoroughly enjoyed this performance,1335139200,,196,4.96969696969697
2403526,3,B000B6N6FE,"First of all the singing is first rate.  Dmitri Hvorostovsky has a magnificant baritone voice that rings out true in this production.  Patrizia Ciofi handles the vocal requirements of Violetta very well.  The images are clear; the sound good.  Now for the staging -- some would call it Eurotrash; others would call it ""high concept.""  I think that the excessive, repeated use of the money metaphor in this production distorted the work and moved too far away from Verdi's intent.  After seeing this production and the Willi Decker production all I can say is that, in my mind, both appear to be the work of nine year olds who keep repeating the punch line of a joke so that we ""get it, get it, get it.""  How many times does an audience have to be ""hit over the head"" with the same idea.  On another note, does Violetta really have to do almost her entire ACT 3 death scene writhing on the floor of the stage?  As long as my eyes were closed the performance was great, but then why buy a DVD?  My final gripe is the use of extreme close ups -- do we need to see vibrating tongues, distended extra jugular veins, sweat and the other signs of the effort these singers are making to produce the sounds required?  A little distance would be more esthetically pleasing and not distract from the music and characters the singers are trying so hard to convey.",1335052800,,1351,4.451219512195122
2403527,5,B000B6N6FE,Beautifully done and absolutely loved this production. Will enjoy watching it for a very long time. My husband I love opera and I expecially love the romantic ones.,1329177600,,164,4.892857142857143
2403528,5,B000B6N6FE,"Call me old-fashioned, but as the curtain rises to the strains of Violetta's party music, I always imagine chandeliers and crinolines.  Ah!  A traditional ""Traviata"" ... there's nothing quite like it!

This live production from Los Angeles Opera is truly classy - as one would expect with Marta Domingo as director.  The orchestra under James Conlon sparkles and glows, and the costumes and staging are just gorgeous.

It must be a challenge for a soprano to find something new in such a famous and oft-performed role, but Rene Fleming certainly achieves it with a beautiful Violetta who is as fragile as crystal, intensely feminine, yet despite her vulnerability seems lit from within.  Her ""Addio Del Passato"" would melt the hardest heart, and certainly wrenched mine.

The story of ""Traviata"" works best for me when the tenor is a little younger than the soprano, and here the casting seems just right.  Rolando Villazn has to be the quintessential Alfredo - wearing his heart on his sleeve and in his glorious voice - a young man experiencing the depths of joy, passion and grief for the first time.  His ""Un Di Felice"" is irresistible, and I've seldom heard a ""Dei Miei Bollenti Spiriti"" that radiates such happiness - all the more poignant in view of what is to come.

Renato Bruson is an impressively dignified Giorgio Germont, whose aloofness stands in marked contrast to his son's impetuosity.  The cameo role of Baron Duphol is also important, and here the sulky petulance of Philip Kraus makes all the more ludicrous the supposition that Violetta has ever been in love with him.

The final scene is poignantly enacted.  Without revealing the ending, suffice to say that it seems to me a fitting conclusion to this beautifully emotive portrayal that Violetta's last gaze should be into the eyes of her beloved Alfredo.

This performance will not date or grow stale.  It is timeless - opera for the ages.",1319673600,,1913,4.879256965944273
2403529,5,B000B6N6FE,"This opera selection is one which I've wanted to view for a long time. Ms. Flemming's performance is without a doubt superb. This is a selection which I will watch over-and-over. The photography makes you feel as if you're at a live performance while audio delivers such quality it is amazing. For the perfect gift or purchase for yourself this production fits the bill! To this reviewer, a 4 Star Performance!",1319241600,,410,4.788732394366197
2403530,5,B000B6N6FE,"La Traviata is a very important opera for me as it was the first opera I went to at the ripe old age of 9. It transformed me and my musical tastes and made me a life long opera buff. I'm now approaching 80, so that's a lot of operas and a lot of Traviatas.(Still my favorite.) I do believe this is the most totally satisfactory one so far. There may have been better Violettas or Alfredos but this production had everything just right. The sets were smashing(I hate these nothing sets of the Eurotrash type) all the major roles were tops ( so good to see the great artist Renato Bruson again) and the comprimarios were all good in their supporting roles. The orchestra under Conlon was sensitive and supportive of the singers. The staging was particularly good. We also heard a more complete score than most productions; with the second verses here and there and two lines of Germont pere in the second act I'd never heard before and, praises be, Oh rio dolor! at the end when Violetta dies. (I had the old Toscanini LP that took 20 minutes off the score and everything was fast, fast, fast!)
Lastly, I was a little unsure as to what Fleming would do with Traviata. Her Manon was as studied and shallow as the character was and thus just right. How would she do this much more complex person in a much greater opera? Well she was perfect. The second act was the dramatic apex of the work; with Bruson a great foil for her great acting as well as singing. Wow! The two together were as moving as anything I've seen on the operatic stage. A last word on Villazon. He was a little too impassioned for me but that's better than just a wimp who stands around sings pretty.(I've seen far too many of those.) He was in great voice here; full, rich, masculine and of beautiful tone. I hope his later vocal problems are over.
In sum: a great production, a super great Traviata!",1307577600,3,1868,4.3861671469740635
2403531,4,B000B6N6FE,"First, I think they all deserve a 'Bravo'! I think it is a well-balanced production. Kind of traditional on its sets, moderate in its dramatic taste...

As other review says, Fleming's Violetta is a little 'too nice' from the beginning. Which makes not dramatic enough to her change of later. Maybe I am wrong. But, I am sure her personality could expand more in this opera.

I have somewhat feel Mr. Villazon is not on his best. After reading other reviews, I understood he had crisis on his voice. I am sure as now 2010, he is doing just fine :)

Ok, As I am a instrumentalist. I have to give some small talk about the orchestra. First, they played very careful. Almost too timid in my taste. It feels like they been warned a fine of 5$ for any wrong notes. Just joking ;) But, seriously, if you compare the same opera with Wiener Philharmoniker with Anna Netrebko, just listen the beginning of the overture, you probably will feel a lot of different in a sense of drama. Well, some people played very carefully, some are more like to take risk if the music is needed to do so.

The sets on stage are 'de luxy'! cloths must be expensive. sure those divas enjoyed :)

The fist act was not as good as the last one. Maybe they were not quite in mood? The chorus at the first act was not quite syn-with-orchestra.

I am secretly thinking the LA Opera are less famous than the MET opera. Because the orchestra is slightly under developed than Met opera orchestra. Maybe LA pays less than MET? I guess so.

It is very nice to see Maestro invited the orchestra came up on stage. It is very rare thing to do in opera or ballet. Most musician are doomed in pit for life and never get up on stage. Thanks Maestro. you don't have to do that, but it is nice.

I would recommend others to compare the 2005ish version of this opera by Anna Netrebko, Villazon, with Wiener Philharmoniker. to see if you like it. There are huge difference between those to production.",1281312000,,1953,4.375690607734807

This was one special night. I could only think of one great souvenir. i wished it had been captured on film so I could relive it. My prayers were met and then it was there.
Amazing,gorgeous and full of beauty. Renee Fleming and Rolando Villazon together as they should be more often. No question as to should you buy this..of course yes. I am a big fan of Renee and seeing her in recital in December for her second visit to L.A. She was a divine Violetta but my favorite role for her was Thais. Renee, thank you.",1257897600,2,766,4.2534246575342465
2403534,3,B000B6N6FE,"I happened to see Ms. Fleming's debut performance at the Houston Grand Opera before she took it to the Met.  She was actually better in Houston than she was in NYC and far better than this performance.  She is THE Prima Donna of the opera stage at this point, but there are others that are catching up to her such as Netrebko.

(Acts I and II)
As to this performance, Villazon is the surprise that he still had his voice with full vigor but somewhat overacted as expected.  Mr. Conlon did not seem to feel comfortable directing this opera.  Fleming does her best when directed by Patrick Summers, Houston Grand Opera's Musical Director (both have recorded together in other settings before with pure beauty).  The other problem with this production was Ms. Domingo's mis en scene.  It seemed overbearing almost in all sets and the layout seemed to push the singers to move along paths made by the sets rather than the sets made to allow the principals and chorus to move freely without thinking of where to place their feet.

Note that neither Ms. Fleming nor Mr. Villazon hit their high notes--it's wonderful when they do (as she did at the premiere in Houston), but it's forgivable today.

(Act III)
Everyone seemed more comfortable and brought this beautiful opera to a higher level than in the first two acts.  Thankfully, because it deserved to have something more positive that I could say about it.  Fleming and Villazon seemed more comfortable at her dying scenes than at the love scenes in Act I.

Still, one can close the eyes and just listen to the music, regardless how well sung.  It's the only opera that I know where 90 percent of the music is known to even those who have operaphobia.  Enjoyable, just not a great production.",1252195200,3,1741,4.647058823529412

2403538,4,B000B6N6FE,"You can always watch a production of La Traviata and if you get bored you can close your eyes and glide through the clouds with the music.  How can you get any better than Fleming and Villazon?  The voices are so good, and the two of them are comfortable with each other.

However, the performance lacks direction.  There were many scenes where the performers seemed to be uncertain as to what to do or where to be.  It did not seem natural.  Fleming and Villazon are the ulitimate in opera today, but they do what their director tells them.  In this case, the performance was lacking.

The scene with Villazon and his father likewise did not seem realistic.  There were too many contrasting emotions; the son was unsure if he was furious, hurt, or shocked, and Dad was making demands but still wanted to be ""Dad"".

Opera has changed drastically over the past 20 years.  No longer do performers stand on stage and sing to the audience, they include acting in their performance.  And when an opera is filmed, there are close-ups and facial expressions with the emotions can make a great opera.

I do not like to compare operas and performances; however, Villazon was superb in the DVD (La Traviata) with Netrebko from Salzburg.  The direction made the difference.  I am not criticizing any of the performers.  I was expecting a 'great' opera when I sat down to watch, and I was disappointed.  I can always enjoy listening to this DVD again.",1234569600,3,1439,4.624505928853755
2403539,5,B000B6N6FE,"I will admit to having some doubts about this performance before viewing it.  First, several years ago, I gave a glowing review to the DVD and CD of the performance under Solti, finding Angela Gheorghiu to be the definitive Violetta.  Second, I have been less than satisfied with some of Renee Fleming's recent performances on CD, finding them to be mannered and self-indulgent.  Well, all my misgivings were rendered unwarranted.  This performance is a knockout.

Admittedly, Renee Fleming has become ""larger than life,"" to the point that it is not always possible for her to disappear inside her roles; you always know that you are watching the great Renee.  But that fact did not diminish her performance, at least after getting past the first act (which for me is merely warm-up for the second and third acts, which, on their own could be the greatest opera ever).  She sang with glorious, refulgent tone throughout, but never let it get in the way of her making a dramatic impact.

Rolando Villazon just about matches Ms. Fleming both in beauty of tone and dramatic intensity.  He may be the most believable Alfredo on video.  And the chemistry between the two leads is palpable.

La Traviata is by far my favorite opera and I have heard and seen it hundreds of times.  Nevertheless, this performance left me in tears.  Admittedly, Marta Domingo directs with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and her costume and set designer follows her lead.  But such is the magic of the performances by the two leads that if I could have only one recording of the opera, I would choose this one, despite the outstanding work of Angela Gheorghiu in her Covent Garden performance.  Renee Fleming gives an equally moving and perhaps even better-sung performance, and Rolando Villazon and Renato Bruson are FAR superior to Frank Lopardo and Leo Nucci (even though, like Nucci, Bruson has passed the point at which he can give a performance worthy of his talent).

This DVD is ESSENTIAL for any opera-lover's collection.",1223769600,7,2009,4.864705882352941

2403541,5,B000B6N6FE,"This production contrasts sharply with the one from Salzburg one year earlier (Willy Decker), and is tons better directed by Mrs. Marta Domingo.
The singers? Renee Fleming, though not as young as Anna Netrebko, is not one jot 'older' in every sense: vocally, visually, pscychologically. Her Violetta is utterly believable, tradition-bound, authentic to the utmost. She is charming, sophisticated, cultured, deeply affectionate towards Alfredo, and has all the hidden dignity associated with a woman of such station in life.
Ms. Fleming demonstrates here that SHE is right now opera's lyrical prima donna; not Netrebko nor Gheorghiu. And I am NOT an American when I state this FACT. The different facets of vocal requirement on the role of Violetta Valery are all fully met by Ms. Fleming. One could not really wish for more.
Villazon here is also tons better than in Salzburg. He is able to bring off much more fireworks than in the earlier performance, which by an large is a one-woman show by Anna Netrebko.
The role of Germont is also wonderfully brought home by Renata Bruson.
The sets and scenary are simply lovely.
For beginners and vertan lovers of Western opera, this production really sets the role model in every sense.

2403546,5,B000B6N6FE,"Beside countless recordings, there are over a dozen video releases of La traviata, one of Verdi's most popular and beloved operas.  So far I have always considered Solti's DECCA performance from the Covent Garden as a benchmark, but this live DVD issue from LAOpera is a worthy competitor indeed.

As a response to Willy Decker highly original, iconoclastic, powerful and intense  Salzburg performance with Anna Netrebko, director Marta (Mrs Placido) Domingo has
chosen a traditional approach but done with immaculate taste, gorgeously colorful sets and costumes. Even she makes, however some minor departures such as the 1st act being set in a roof garden and the sudden, but to me uncalled for appearance of a masked death like figure in the 3rd act. No offence meant, but I feel that these polite changes really mean nothing and done for the sake of doing something different.

Musically speaking, James Conlon's unerring sense of tempi and inspired conducting
provides excitement you can feel throughout and no other American soprano could be
more ideally suited for the title role than Renee Fleming. Her ability to throw herself into the part
with total emotional commitment and her vocal artistry in this very demanding role makes her performance a stunning success.  Her partner, young Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon (also appearing in the Salzburg DVD) with
 his strong, clear voice, dramatic and passionate acting is an instant audience favorite.
Perhaps he will be a possible heir to the tradition of Pavarotti and Domingo. Third in this exceptional trio is Renato Bruson, who at 71 is already a legend creating a stern, elegant and ultimately a very sympathetic Germont Pere  with his powerful, expressive velvety baritone.

Excellent choice for traditionalists, but do not pass by the Salzburg set either.",1211241600,2,1818,5.2020547945205475
2403547,5,B000B6N6FE,"This recording of La Traviata - one of my favorite operas - is a beautiful recording with two awesome performers, Fleming and  Villazon.

2403548,4,B000B6N6FE,"For those who have, and are disappointed with the outdated audio and video quality of the highly edited Zeffirelli film version or feel that the Covent Garden version (while excellent in audio and video and a truly impressive performance from Angela Gheorghiu) is too bland and sterile, I recommend giving this DVD a chance. The audio and video on this disk are once again of a high order, and Patrizia Ciofi shows that apart from having an incredible voice, she is also a stunning actress who is not afraid to take chances with any role that comes her way. Indeed, the transformation that Miss Ciofi goes through in the last act is almost heart-breaking to watch. This is not some glamorized version which portrays Violetta Valery as an unfortunate fun-loving young lady who dies from consumption, but a `pulls no punches' story of a woman who sells her body for money at the start of the story and finds, and realizes what love means, when her life is slipping away.

Robert Carsen's updating of this work is generally successful, though I feel the middle section would have benefited from another interior setting instead of the exterior woodland one. The slightly raunchy cabaret setting in the night club works particularly well in contributing an up to date feel to what is often a prim and somewhat proper party episode. The orchestra under Lorin Maazel and supporting players, especially Dmitri Hvorostovsky all give credence to this being accepted as a quality alternative to other options that are available. Maybe this is not the first version of `La Traviata' that one should acquire, but if you want to see an opera devoid of the outdated trappings of yesteryear and get  something that resonates with what is going on in the world today, this is it. It may not be perfect in all areas (there is a fast forward button to overcome that) but this version is well worth seeing and I would hate to be without a record of Patrizia Ciofi's rendering of this most tragic role.",1207612800,2,1982,4.758720930232558

2403552,5,B000B6N6FE,"In my view, there is only one rival to this set's claim to being best of show in DVD presentations of ""Traviata,"" and that is the DGG set from the 2005 Salzburg production starring Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon. I discount the early '90's Covent Garden set with Ghiorghiu and Lopardo because there is no discernible chemistry between the protagonists and, despite the intelligent staging and Lopardo's accomplished vocalism, Ghiorghiu's otherwise lovely performance is marred by the fact she sings sharp at many of the key moments. In any event, aficionados of the opera on DVD should have both the Ciofi and the Netrebko performances. The Salzburg performance probably trumps this one in terms of sheer vocal brilliance: the combination of Nebrebko and Villzon is breathtaking.  Willy Decker's staging, while ingenious, is nonetheless very 'high concept' and bloodless: it's hard to get a sense of the social milieu that makes Violetta's predicament so harrowing.  The triumph of the Salzburg production, in other words, belongs to the star singers, and the singing is indeed incandescent, as is the sexual chemistry onstage between Netrebko and Villazon. But they are working pretty much in a fuschia-tinted vacuum. The set from La Fenice, on the other hand, boasts an extraordinarily inventive, richly detailed staging by Robert Carsen. The updating to a 1970's Studio 54 scene is probably not for all markets, but it is consistently (and beautifully) rendered and it provides the necessary, harrowing sense of context against which to measure the precariousness of Violetta's situation.  As for the singers, Ciofi is no match for Netrebko in terms of vocal suavity: the sheer sound of Nebrebko's Violetta is a thing of wonder.  But Ciofi, with a reedier and more agile instrument, is a far better actor and she is able to communicate the chiaroscuro emotions behind of vocal line of Verdi's score in a more nuanced and deeply moving way than Netrebko.  I would not want to have to choose between the two performances -- not least because Ciofi's partner, Alfredo Sacca, while good, cannot match the febrile intensity and vocal glamour of Villazon.  Still, if I had to choose, I'd go for Ciofi.",1199750400,6,2202,5.102777777777778

I always tell my friends if they have never seen an opera, ""La Traviata"" is the best opera to start with. I personally went to see this production of ""La Traviata"" at LA Opera and I was very impressed with. The direction of Marta Domingo is very impressive and memorable. Renee Fleming's superb dramatic soprano voice is perfect for playing Violetta. For me she is the queen of the opera today. She was not only singing, but also acting as well. Rolando Villazon has portrayed one of the best Alfredo's. His voice and charisma reminds me of Domingo's. The love between Alfredo and Violetta is so true on a stage that you will easily get involved with the story line. Before when the lead singers were overweight it was very hard to convince us that they were in love. In the real story of La Traviata the main characters supposed to be in their early 20's and that really shows in this wonderful production. I was also mesmerized to see how the chorus sang in the background. The great direction of Mrs. Domingo gives the chorus a new look and life of its own. Back in the days when the lead was singing the entire chorus would look at the singer.  In this production the chorus would do different things and they are all individuals. In a moment you will think you are watching a movie instead of a life opera. You will fall in love with these beautiful characters in this one of the greatest operas ever written.",1199664000,9,1567,4.890977443609023
2403554,4,B000B6N6FE,"This is a most enjoyable DVD - not perhaps the most exciting Traviata out there, but a good, solid, musically polished account filtered through a visually attractive, traditional production.  There are no earth shaking ideas here, but the direction is sensible and straightforward and well executed. Fleming is on good behavior - her Violetta is not to all tastes, but she does a lovely job here. She does not take the high options she did employ when new to the role, but the coloratura of Act one is cleanly handled and she is in solid form throughout. Villazon is lovely to hear, and dramatically quite compelling. Bruson has seen better days, but is still caught in good late career form. Conlon's conducting is perhaps a trifle four square at times, but given the erratic treatment the opera has often sufferred of late, this does bring its rewards. The sound quality is not outstanding - those with fine digital systems may be a bit underwhelmed, but it is higher than average and perfectly acceptable. All in all, a fine, ""reference"" account performed by some of the more enjoyable forces of our day. If you are looking for a basic Traviata for your collection, this well be the choice for you.",1199577600,7,1201,4.746411483253588
2403555,5,B000B6N6FE,"This LA production of La Traviata is the best I've seen so far.
The modern trend of opera productions often starts from a minimalist and avant garde approach. The La Fenice production of 2004 and the Salzburg production of 2005 are clear evidences of the new approach.
May be European audiences love new packaging in their operas (after all, these are `their' operas). As a foreign member of the operatic audience, I only wish that opera productions would stick with the script more in terms of staging and costumes, etc.
Having saw the La Fenice and Salzburg productions before this LA one, I must congratulate the producer Mr. Domingo for bringing this production to live for the benefit of worldwide viewers instead of the connoisseur few.
As for the performance itself, while I fully agree that the Salzburg production boasts of a wonderful Violetta in Ms Netrebko, I would still prefer Ms Fleming's as being more convincing with a transcendental portrayal that uplifts the character of this courtesan to a more humanistic level.
Violetta Valery knows her illness right from the start of the story. Netrebko's portrayal has more postmodern recklessness in it than would otherwise be present in Verdi's script. Her coloratura in Sempre Libera is less than fine, but her voice is superb. Ciofi's Violetta is simply vocally pale by comparison to the other two. Fleming's Violetta, on the other hand, boasts of a three-fold strength - the right voice; not plangent as Netrebko's but `just right' for the character. The three Acts fittingly treated in different moods with the right variations in  timbre. She has the right look, too. Renee's reduced waistline is astounding to any woman of her age. A result of vast efforts at the gym, doubtless. While Ciofi lacks the beauty of this great courtesan, Netrebko (and Gheorghiu) have too much of health and youth (Netrebko in particular, too full-cheeked and healthy through and through) that missed the underlying consumption. Perhaps only Anna Moffo rivalled Fleming in terms of having the right `look' for this character. Then lastly, of course, vocal technique. I have heard Fleming in some vastly inferior recordings. Those were the bad OLD days. Since the beginning of 2007 I have only heard and saw a wonderful operatic soprano whose acting and singing techniques are both hard to beat by any other currently on stage. Well-nigh 50 yet reaching prime after prime vocally! This IS some thing to be reckoned with - can new-comers guarantee this sort of endurance is the next interesting topic to watch out for. Granted that music, like any other art form, ripens with age and experience, a soprano in such top form and with such an curriculum vitae as Fleming bespeaks of a highly disciplined lifestyle resultant from great respect for her art. Such accomplishment really deserves nothing less than admiration and fullest respect from audience and colleagues alike.
So much for Fleming.
Rolando Villazon also shows great improvement from his Salzburg 2005 performance. The voice is much more meaty, his demeanour much more self-assured. There is no longer that `Mr Bean' sort of childishness around him as evident in the 2005 version. This Alfredo is both appropriately debonair and impetuous in turn. If Rolando is able to keep his voice up to this level, he will surely gain his place as being the best Alfredo since Nicolai Gedda.
Then last but not least, the portrayal of Bruson as Germont Sr. By far the best ever to be seen on stage, if not `heard'. I agree that the voice is used - to say that he is 70 years old but the voice is not used would be a clear lie. Again, the universal `old wine' theory - the voice is passably good, still adequate for the role, but his artistry and stage presence on the other hand are both immense. Compare his Germont Sr. with Hvorostovsky and Hampson. The La Fenice production is simply hilarious in getting a vocally superb but otherwise awkward and stiff Hvorostovsky to `play' this role. In their respective productions, both Hampson and Hvorostovsky could not get into the character in the same way as Renato Bruson does here. The imposing encounter in Act II with Violetta demands strengths of character in the portrayal that have to be brought home clearly to audiences in order for them to understand why Violetta is being convinced. Bruson is imposing without being pompous (like Hvorostovsky), insistent without being harsh. His `lecture' to his son in that famous aria is at once vivid and moving.
In conclusion, this is THE definitive La Traviata on DVD, and one really need not look further.",1199232000,6,4596,4.915057915057915

2403557,5,B000B6N6FE,"How I wish I could have been in the house that night! I would have witnessed the definitive staging of Verdi's masterpiece,La Traviata. The principals were phenomenal! Renee Fleming,prima donna assoluta,from opening to closing credits,was Violetta Valery. Her 2nd act duet with the elder Germont and her ""Swan Song"" were master class material. As she ages,she only perfects her instrument. Her tonality,trills and pianissimo only improve with age. She is at the zenith of her powers here. Vocally and visually,she put her stamp on the role.
With this performance, I join those extolling the talents of Rolando Villazon. Don't judge a book by its cover. His instrument combines the machismo of Placido Domingo and the tears of Franco Corelli. The tenor repertory is secure. I hope he has the good sense not to overuse his wonderful gift. He truly is the best tenor on the world stage today.
The distinguished Renato Bruson was perfectly cast as the elder Germont. His instrument bespeaks of natural aging. His tone was beautiful throughout. His 2nd act aria could bring tears to the Devil's eyes!

Robert Carsen was able to set the story successfully in a contemporary world that mixes simplicity and complexity to express deep emotions rooted in love. Patrizia Ciofi in the title role proves to be a convincing Violetta in her stage presence and singing. Memorable are her Sempre Libera and final scenes.  As Germont, Dmitri Hvorostovsky is a highlight of the production. His portrayal is convincing and his voice suited for the role.  The Alfredo of Roberto Sacca is committed to the role, but vocally he is the weakest in the cast.

2403559,5,B000B6N6FE,"Renee Fleming reigns in our opera firmament, and this role suits her like a glove - a suitably worn one.  For this is a Violetta who looks and sounds soiled, as she should.  The demands of the first act require a strong assured voice which she gives it.  At the same time, there is a tired, almost desperate note under the surface of her singing as she contemplates the possibility of true love in a demi-world that mocks the very notion of romance.  By the last act, she is used up and the pathos is almost too much.  When the lovers are reunited, her return to life is actually believable and all the more heart-breaking when it ends so quickly.

This production looks great.  The voices are superb.  The acting suits the story.  The performance rises above the stereotypes of the genre.  We care what happens.  I forgot I was watching a legend perform a legendary role.  And when the curtain fell, I thought ""Verdi would have smiled.""  I have other recordings of this piece.  I could never part with Sutherlands two renditions.  I will continue to prize my Kleiber recording for the revelation it is.  I can even appreciate the opulence of the Zefferelli version.

As usual, Fleming and Villazone sing very well, although I think Georghiu was a better Violetta. Buscon developed a wobble in his louder passages which I found annoying. The staging of this Traviata was the best of the three.

He simply doesn't have the voice for it anymore.  I have heard and seen this great singer in many performances and have always been thrilled by his distinctive voice.  I could recognize it with my eyes closed.  To put it politely, this legendary singer should quietly retire.  Renee Fleming is still in the experimental stages of discovering this roll but she is defintely on her way to becoming a Violetta to be remembered.  She should immediately drop the habit of speaking some of the words instead of singing them.  I suppose it made sense to her for dramatic effect.  Roland Villiazon is stiff and robotic as Alfredo but has some excellent vocal moments.  James Conlon's conducting moves things along nicely but Marta Domingo's production/direction doesn't hold a candle to the sets and costumes Franco Deffirelli did for the Metropolitan which is currently in repertory at that great theater.

2403564,4,B000B6N6FE,"Let us hope that the Alfredo, Rolando Villazon, recovers quickly and in full from the unspecified difficulties that, at this writing, have forced him to cancel approximately half a year of engagements, and may have contributed to performances earlier this year suggesting a vocal crisis. In the 2006 Los Angeles TRAVIATA, he improves on his promising Alfredo opposite Anna Netrebko a year earlier at Vienna (preserved on DG DVD and CD). The phrasing is more mature and pointed, the burnished tone and virile address much as before, and the portrayal marked by less exaggeration and straining for effect, although that last may have something to do with his being liberated from Decker's cretinous  production. He is physically and vocally matched to this role in a way that makes me think of di Stefano, and I hope that the similarities do not extend too far -- a di Stefanoesque premature burnout would be a great loss for us all. He cements his status as one of the front-rank documented Alfredos by making even the cabaletta ""O mio rimorsa"" (no more than pro forma early Verdi on the page) sound very nearly like great music.

Renato Bruson, as Germont pere, has appeared in lead roles all over the world since his professional debut as Count di Luna in 1961, and had reached the great age of 70 by the date of this performance. Germont has long been a Bruson specialty, and he recorded it commercially opposite Renata Scotto and Alfredo Kraus (Muti/EMI) almost 30 years ago, when he was the youngest singer of the principals, playing the oldest character. We all of us are at the mercy of time, and one struggles to write about the new performance without recourse to the patronizing. My first impulse, for example, was to call his work here ""courageous,"" but that would not do justice to the full effect. I suppose the best way of putting it across the plate is to say that you will look long and hard to find a 70-year-old baritone who can perform Germont on this level, and who commits so little for which any apology is necessary. The learned Mr. Davis's editorial review accuses Bruson of mistaking stiffness for authority; I respectfully dissent. This is a Germont who is stubbornly of his time and his milieu, intelligent and capable of feeling but not easily swayed by sentiment, nor dissuaded from a considered course of action. Watch him carefully in the long encounter with Violetta in Act II, consider who Germont is and what he believes, and ask yourself if the veteran Bruson does not get more of it right than at least three-fourths of the Germonts you have seen (if you have such a frame of reference). In the beginning, he is brusque but never menacing or heavy-handed. He has the determination and conviction we want and expect from a Germont, and an appropriate quality of encroaching frailty and mortality that we very rarely get; this colors all of his appearance and interactions. Look at him and listen to him when Violetta repeats back in questioning form, with surprise, the information that Germont has *two* children -- in his short response there is a mingling of paternal love and pride and a distracted quality (as if this has come out absentmindedly), a desire to move the conversation along and continue to drive the agenda. When Violetta asks him to embrace her as a daughter, he seems both touched and slightly embarrassed. In his appearance and manner, Bruson is Giorgio Germont to the life, and for the greater duration of the time he was on stage, I was struck more by how much of that burgundy velvet voice he has left than by what the passage of the years has rubbed away. The fortes are not always ideally controlled, and the climax of the entreaty to Alfredo, the chestnut ""Di provenza,"" does not come easily, but it would be a harder heart than mine that could remain unmoved by this ""Di provenza."" For me, it was the most affecting part of the evening: an opportunity to watch and listen to one of the last living, working links to an idiomatic performance tradition in Italian opera that, if not dying, is certainly not in the thriving estate that it was 40 years ago. While this L.A. audience carries on a bit too much for my taste, stopping the show with applause after essentially every discrete number, occasionally to the detriment of musical continuity, Bruson richly deserves the loud ""bravo"" that some male spectator shouts after that aria concludes, and the ovation that follows. Had I been there, I certainly would have added to its volume.

To Rene Fleming's Violetta, the reaction is more ambivalent. Fleming's basic persona is a warm and inviting one. She looks smashing in Giovanni Agostinucci's period costumes, and she excels as the gracious hostess of Act I. We know precisely what Alfredo means in Act II when he sings blissfully of her ""gentle smile of love,"" for we have already seen abundant evidence of it. The shaping and deployment of the great Act III aria ""Addio del passato"" are clearly the work of a major singer. Too, Fleming has worked hard at the fioritura. In Act I it still *sounds* like work, but it is a dutiful and conscientious effort. The trill at ""Ora son forte"" in Act III is, wonder of wonders, excellent (I even checked it against that of an esteemed recorded Violetta whom one would expect to be better at this sort of thing, and the impression held). Her ripe-sounding tone is not ideal for this part, to my ears, and there are long stretches of the role requiring that she take up residence in high altitudes where she would be more comfortable making only brief visits. She wisely avoids the unwritten high E-flat at the end of ""Sempre libera,"" but does anyone really care anymore? (One breed of Italian opera buff used to claim that any Violetta who failed to sing that note was a failed Violetta, no matter what went on for the remaining two-plus hours. One hopes that this breed has become extinct.) My reservations about the performance are more about questionable stylistic and dramatic choices on the soprano's part than the purely vocal matters. Although this is not as mannered a performance as her most divisive ones of recent years have been, there are oddities. What effect, for example, is achieved -- other than a precious kind of  distinction for the sake of it -- when the musically important word ""misterioso"" (in ""Ah fors  lui"") is minced out in five truncated, detached notes, rather than ones bound together in a legato phrase? Violetta's great plea ""Amami, Alfredo"" near the end of Act II is similarly sectioned out rather than unfurled, although there it seems less a mannerism than an unwisely slow tempo choice; she has to attack it in pieces because she otherwise could not breathe through it. Perhaps the most moving music in the opera, Violetta's ""Alfredo, Alfredo, di questo core"" (sung upon her awakening from her faint at Flora's Act II party), is also too slow -- not only in and of itself but in relation to the ebb and flow of the majestic ensemble of which it is the cornerstone -- and the vocalism is weighted with needless lily-gilding affectations to boot. Often I had the sense that conductor James Conlon was not so much *complicit* as he was *compliant*. Every one of the points of the score where I felt the music was being pulled out of shape so that the singer could overmilk a phrase or exaggerate some dramatic point, was a Violetta passage (Act II's ""Ah, dite alla giovine"" is one more in the pile of exhibits).

A final word on the topic of exaggeration: Fleming's histrionics in the crucial Violetta/Germont confrontation are not well calibrated, and I am not sure whether the blame for this should be laid on her, director Marta Domingo, or both (from prior experience with Fleming and Domingo separately, I tend to suspect the soprano). More subtlety and a gradual build to despair are needed here. Fleming does so much audible sobbing, gasping, and vocal thickening to suggest singing through tears that at moments when the anguish is supposed to ratchet up, she has left herself nowhere to go -- she can only still more heavily underline what she already has been doing. Violetta Valery is a sensitive woman of deep feeling and tragic predicaments, yes, but there are other sides to her: stoicism, a core of iron, and an innate nobility that Giorgio Germont picks up on almost immediately. The Violettas of Albanese and Callas, de los Angeles and Scotto, Caball and Cotrubas, Stratas and (though her complete performance is beset with other problems) Netrebko evidenced this. They were very different singers and very different women, but they knew where the dramatic keys were in the scene, and they knew how to make sure we did as well. This is the greatest shortcoming of Fleming's Violetta and of this entire production -- in such an important scene, this remarkable character is little more than a teary matron hanging over the arm of a couch, all but drowning out the baritone with Lucy Ricardoesque sobs.

The Los Angeles Opera Orchestra and Chorus perform laudably for Conlon, whose work is sensible and proportionate when he is not overindulging the soprano. Marta Domingo's production eschews eccentricity without eschewing initiative -- most of the central action is sympathetically and intelligently worked out, and there are interesting things going on around the margins. I particularly liked the treatment of Annina, whose love for her mistress and grief at her impending loss come through more strongly here than is usually the case (the comprimario singers, this is a good time to say, are uniformly excellent). This surely would be a candidate for inclusion on any list of the most visually beautiful opera DVDs available at present. Decor is sumptuous and colorful (director Domingo herself has a background in design, and her credentials presumably influenced the shape of Agostinucci's costumes and sets). The picture quality has a true cinematic sheen. The ubiquitous video director Brian Large continues to demonstrate that he is ubiquitous with reason; what he chooses to emphasize is always pertinent, often telling. He even gets good reaction shots from the choristers playing guests in Violetta's Act I party, which Domingo has imaginatively staged al fresco.

And so, for a traditional TRAVIATA with state-of-the-art audio/visual credits, a formidable contender. The most ardent fans of Fleming, or those who feel they will be untroubled by what I describe as musical and histrionic infelicities marring an intermittently impressive Violetta, should feel free to add a star.",1195257600,56,10547,4.855555555555555
2403565,5,B000B6N6FE,"This beautifully produced and directed masterwork, with the superb Renee Fleming and tenor dynamo, Rolando Villazon, is really an extraordinary experience.  The magnificently detailed production and the ideal cast of singers, including in a small role Daniel Montenegro (one of the American Tenors from the 2003 PBS concert), is a performance to treasure.  Ms Fleming has instinctively chosen this as the right time for her to take on the role of the courageous and tragic Verdi courtesan and she is on point every step of the way. Maestro Villazon is brilliant and touching and his interaction with Ms Fleming could have set off the fire sprinklers in the theatre.  A not-to-be-missed pairing in a finely crafted production.

2403566,5,B000B6N6FE,"I too was present at LA Opera the night it was filmed. I thought that performance of Traviata was the best opera production I had ever seen. Assuming the engineering is up to par, I'm anxiously awaiting my souvenir copies. Traviata is one of those opera it is impossible to write a list of the best numbers; every track goes on the list.

(Later)- Track 22 of this recording is one of my favorite arias of Traviata because I can sing along. Renato Bruson is a fave baritone; I've got more than a dozen opera CDs with him in the cast. After listening to this opera several times, I realized: ""That's me!"" I yelled ""Bravo"" at the end of that aria: only once. It was perfectly timed. I was at the back of the second balcony but noticed mikes along the ceiling, so high we couldn't see the ceiling in the front of the hall. I was shocked my shout was so readily heard. I hope my appreciation for Bruson doesn't interfere with your enjoyment of the DVD.",1194825600,6,948,4.325842696629214
2403567,5,B000B6N6FE,"I'm a little surprised that some of the reviewers have qualified their recommendations with negative comments, since I consider this not only the best Traviata I have seen on DVD but also a contender for greatest opera DVD ever! But before I drown the reader in hyperbole(as I have been known to do), allow me to step back, catch my breath, and calmly explain why this is a must own for any lover of vintage opera.

Perhaps no opera has been as well served by DVD as La Traviata. Prior to purchasing this, I already owned two excellent DVDs of this opera, so why invest in a third? Two reasons: Renee Fleming and Renee Fleming. I was fortunate enough to see her perform this role live in New York under the baton of the esteemed Valery Gergiev, and in a typically lavish Zefferelli production, in what I believe was her first ever series of performances in the role of VIoletta, and was absolutely blown away, and infatuated, with her lively, mercurial, incredibly sung interpretation of the doomed courtesan. Even in an upper balcony I could feel the waves of this character's overpowering passion. Ever since, I have been anxiously waiting for a DVD release of a Fleming Traviata. I had been hoping for the Met, but after watching this Los Angeles Opera presentation I am not disappointed. This is as good as what I saw in New York, perhaps better.

Fleming doesn't dance across the stage with the same reckless abandon she displayed in New York(at the Met she threw a champagne glass against the wall during Sempre libera), and she isn't as quick out of the gate as Angela Gheorghiu(her opening recitatives are a little underwhelming), but she still delivers a full-bodied and full throttle performance, getting inside the skin of this tragic character(and under the skin of the audience) like no other, making you wish Violetta really could come back to life at the end just so you could hear her sing some more. This is a very brave performance in that Fleming often pulls some vocal surprises, taking the singing in different directions than the listener is accustomed to, and pulls it off every time. Similar to Johanna Meier's Liebestod in the recent Deutsche Grammophon Tristan und Isolde DVD, Fleming gives a softer reading of the powerhouse aria Addio del passato, but no less impassioned, or effective. Fleming might be my favorite Violetta EVER because she injects so much humanity into Verdi's powerful notes.

Renee Fleming is certainly enough of a reason to buy this DVD, but far from the only one. Of course I had heard and read a great deal about Rolando Villazon before watching this, but I don't think I had ever seen or heard him perform. I was startled the second he opened his mouth by the quality of his voice. I'm not sure why(maybe because of his youth and his smallish physical stature), but I was expecting a more high-pitched, less mature voice. His deep, masculine tenor is gorgeous, and perfect for this role. I don't find his impassioned mannerisms inappropriate, on the contrary, they are welcome because they add greatly to the character. In fact, watching Villazon's macho but sensitive pleadings, listening to the ardor in his voice, I felt I finally understood Alfredo Germont. So many tenors play the role as a shy, smitten schoolboy in the first act, then the audience is supposed to buy his sudden transformation into smoldering man-of-action. Villazon smolders from the moment he steps on stage, and in effect provides the viewer with the most convincing Alfredo on record. In his hands, even the sort-of-silly act two cabaletta, one of the opera's rare less-than-sublime moments, becomes a vital part of the score. I, too, was hoping to see Dmitri Hvorostovsky reprise the role of Giorgio Germont, which he performed in New York, I thought Renato Bruson might be too old, but my fears were assuaged almost immediately, he certainly looks the part more than any other baritone, and his voice, while tremulous at times, is still a force to be reckoned with. He also matches his peers in the acting department, his Germont is perhaps even more sympathetic than Hvorostovsky's, and almost certainly more intimidating. The tenderness his character feels for his son is palpable, particularly during Di Provenza il mar, and when he sings Piangi, piangi during his devastating act two duet with Fleming, he is weeping as much as she is! When all is said and done, I wouldn't trade his performance for any other Verdi baritone's.

I can't stress this enough...the vocal and physical performances of the leads are so strong, so impassioned, that the result is an emotionally draining performance that is at times unbearably beautiful.

James Conlon seems to have a deep affinity for this score. He knows just when to speed up and when to slow down in order to afford his singers some breathing room, when to turn up the volume(although the orchestra never sounds bombastic) and when to ease it down so his players can luxuriate in Verdi's tender nuances, and he conducts with an almost Wagnerian dramatic flow. This score(Verdi's elegiac restructuring of, and farewell to, bel canto) has never sounded better, in fact the performance gave me a renewed appreciation for just how great an opera this really is, worthy of the pantheon, full of orchestral subtlety and meaningful vocalism, which is as much as you can ask from any opera. Conlon's interpretation is such a wonderful expereience that mentioning the occasional cut(a practice that usually makes steam come out of my ears) in this case sounds like nitpicking. Marta Domingo's sets are gloriously traditional, appropriately lavish but also very tasteful, even during the Parisian galas. They add to the performance while never trying to overwhelm it. Brian Large's video direction is movielike, appropriate for a Tinseltown presentation. The sound quality is superb, well-balanced. This is my first experience with the Los Angeles opera and I am very VERY impressed.

As of this writing, my beloved Ohio State Buckeyes are 10-0 and ranked number one in the nation, and I just watched a perfect DVD of La Traviata. Can life get any better?",1194048000,48,6129,4.89980732177264
2403568,5,B000B6N6FE,"With so many La Traviata DVD's available that feature ""superstar"" sopranos (Edita Gruberova, Angela Gheorghiu, Anna Netrebko to name but three), I popped this one into my DVD player with some trepidation. After all, Renee Fleming, beautiful though her voice is, has been known to turn a Verdi aria into a jazz number. And Rolando Villazon is a wonderfully expressive tenor, but has a tendency to overact and can wear you out with his flailing about onstage.

I'm happy to report that my concerns were unfounded. As Alfredo, Villazon is in even better voice than he was in the 2005 Salzburg production of Traviata with Netrebko. He has also toned down his physical movements; his acting is an asset here, not a distraction.

Fleming is dazzling as Violetta. I think the reason she sometimes jazzes up 18th and 19th Century opera is that she can do anything with her instrument; this is a unique and special ability that unfortunately has sometimes led her to make the wrong style choice. Here, however, she sings Verdi as I assume the master intended. She pays careful attention to phrasing and is faithful to the score, yet also sings with abandon, making Violetta truly her own. That combination of the seemingly contradictory qualities of control and abandon are what, to me, make for great opera singing. (Those same qualities also describe the unique sound of many Verdi scores.) Fleming brings the house down before she can even get to the famous, ""Sempre Libera,"" by turning ""Ah! Fors'e lui"" into such a bittersweet and moving contemplation on the possibility that love has finally found her, that her exquisite trills at the end will make your spine tingle.

Some people were disappointed that Dmitri Hvorostovsky bowed out as Germont in this L.A. Opera production and was replaced with Renato Bruson. Bruson does a fine job and, in fact, I was disappointed with the usually superb Hvorostovsky when he played Germont in the La Fenice 2004 production of Traviata. He was strangely stiff and remote as the concerned, if overbearing, father. He seemed uncomfortable as Germont (which, of course, may not have been the case two years later in this production). Nevertheless, the veteran Bruson brings the right balance of sternness and fatherly love to the role.

Call me old fashioned, but I love Traviata with lush sets and period costumes. If you do too, you'll drink in the sights here.

I've decided that I don't need to find the definitive DVD of La Traviata. Violetta is such a multi-layered character upon whom Verdi has made such varied vocal demands that I like to savor the highlights each soprano brings to the role: Gruberova's vulnerability and how she seems to literally fade away as she sings ""Addio del passato""; Gheorghiu's powerful and heartbreaking cry, ""Amami, Alfredo,"" in which she turns a few short musical phrases into a stand-alone aria; Netrebko's spontaneity and charisma. And now I can add Fleming to that list. She sings every line with clear intention; not a note is thrown away. Precision and abandon. It's a dazzling performance.",1193961600,163,3066,4.945631067961165
2403569,4,B000B6N6FE,"I would not buy this even though it has Rolando Villazn, but only because I already have the one which also has Anna Netrebko!",1193875200,3,126,4.291666666666667
2403570,4,B000B6N6FE,"First off, Fleming and Villazon are, happily, both in wonderful voice. Hers is one of the most beautifully sung Violettas I've ever heard, and he sings with undeniable vitality here, skillfully alternating forte outbursts with elegant piano shadings. The conducting on this DVD is mostly energetic, save for a few strikingly slow tempos, and the set and the costumes, unlike those in so many recent Eurotrash productions, are generally attractive and as such duly recede into the background, not arrogantly announcing they're the principal reasons for the production.

But there are drawbacks, nonetheless. They keep this, I'd argue, from being what has been hailed as the ""definitive Traviata"" on DVD. The problems lie with the acting of the principals, a concern of prominence on DVD, though how much is owing to them and how much to the possible vulgarity of Marta Domingo's or Brian Large's direction is an open question. First of all, Villazon is allowed to overact to an embarrasing degree. With his furled eyebrows, lurches of the body, and semaphoric hand gestures, he comes to resemble not so much an infatuated youth in an opera as a corny silent movie star hamming it up. To be fair, this is a filmed stage performance and perhaps from the balcony his excesses would not appear so over the top, but the DVD, with its closeness, unfortunately emphasizes them.

Fleming is for the most part more reticent in front of the camera, though her readiness to break into what looks like an apparent hootchy-kootchy sort of dance during the ""Sempre Libera"" reminds older viewers of the superiority of the unforgettably graceful, appropriately waltzing Patricia Brooks. The overdone smooching of the principals, too, given the time period of the setting, seems less appropriate than it does a concession to the low tastes of an audience wanting something ""hot"" for its overpriced tickets.",1193702400,12,1888,5.087096774193548

2403573,3,B000B6N6FE,"It would be good if it is just a CD.

To celebrate the reopening of the premiere venue of La Traviata, the producer really got some funny ideas about Verdi's work.

Modernisation of operas, if not done in good taste, often tends to be disastrous, and this is a typical case.

I do not mind the revealing dresses of Ciofi - in the newer production of La Traviata Netrebko did not have a better 'gown' to cover herself either.

What I do mind is the shock that the production conveys - may be that was meant to be so, but it is quite distasteful in certain respects.

The appearances of props like US $ notes, cameras, TV sets, microphones, spectacles, all smells of cabaret shows or the Rouge Moullin, but those things are obviously quite far off Verdi's script. Would a 1970's Aflredo fall in love with a prostitute that has consumption? (Or may be a drug addict, if the conversion is to be be more complete?)From the moment of the overture onwards, one is being 'prepared' to witness some changes, but as the plot proceeds, the changes are often too unexpectant and sometimes even weird. It is simply difficult to believe that this Alfredo would fall in love with this Violetta.

Vocally, the three protagonists are quite even, with the pair Alfredo/Violetta matching well. Both are smallish voices, effortful singing, but managed quite well. The vocal star is Hvorostovsky, but the role of the Germont Sr. as a whole is a real joke to viewers.

If it was not for Maazel's conducting and Hvorostovsky and Ciofi and Sacca's singing, the production could be called a real disaster.",1177200000,2,1580,4.661870503597123

2403575,2,B000B6N6FE,"Mine seems to be a minority opinion here, but this production was a big disappointment. I was looking forward to Patrizia Ciofi as Violetta because she was thrilling in the recent Lyon Opera production of Lucie de Lammermoor. I was curious to see Roberto Sacca as Alfredo because I've only heard him as a sweet-voiced Mozart tenor (he does a great job of humanizing Don Ottavio in The Zurich Opera's 2001 Don Giovanni). And I expected great things from Dmitri Hvorostovsky who was so good as di Luna in Il Trovatore.

The first surprise was to see Violetta played as a common prostitute instead of the self-educated and refined courtesan, Marie Duplessis, on whom Verdi based the character. To help with this transformation, the director updates the setting to the 1970's, Violetta parading around in flimsy lingerie and Alfredo appearing to be some kind of photographer (paparazzi perhaps?). I can accept the director's choice to focus on Violetta's ""bottom line"" profession, but in Act I, Ciofi and Sacca play their characters as so self-absorbed that they are entirely unsympathetic. How can we believe Alfredo loves Violetta when, as he cries ""mysterioso"" in ""Di quell' amor,"" he's throwing photographs at her (""head shots"" in the trade) and then sings the rest of the duet with his camera in front of his face, snapping pictures? This duet seems like a complete failure to me.

Ciofi continues to disappoint in Act I. She oversings and overacts in her big set piece. I find it painful to watch. In Act II, Sacca's voice comes alive in ""O mio rimorso,"" but why is the floor of the forest covered with U.S. dollars printed with Verdi's picture? I don't get it. (The bills later fall like leaves as Violetta cries ""Amami, Alfredo,"" providing a big distraction in what should be the opera's most heartbreaking moment.) I was hoping Hvorostovsky would save the day as Germont, but he's strangely stiff and remote as the concerned, if overbearing, father. He seems uncomfortable in the role.

Ciofi's best moments come in her death scene, including a haunting rendition of ""Addio del passato."" But on the whole, this production feels forced, from the singing to the acting to the directorial choices. For Traviata on DVD, I recommend either the 1992 La Fenice production with Gruberova, Schicoff, and Zancanaro (Rizzi conducting) or the 1994 Covent Garden production with Gheorghiu, Lopardo, and Nucci (Solti conducting).",1145059200,25,2420,5.0
2403576,5,B000B6N6FE,"Admittedly there are some things to criticise about the underlying concept behind this production (I do not agree with Robert Carson's premise that Violetta was a prostitute.  She was a courtesan, something far different)-- but surely that is part of the fun of seeing new productions.  Fortunately the ""stand and deliver"" static productions are dying off, singers are now expected to be able to act as well as sing; and opera productions are moving in varied directions -- some more successfully than others.  Carson has a basic premise and builds on it in a unified manner.  The production is nowhere near as bad as Mr. Piper's somewhat over-the-top review would have one believe; and I hope that no one is put off by his review.  The ballet which he calls a complete bust is an appropriate campy nightclub production; there is not all that much rolling around the floor; the lingerie is not all that revealing; etc etc.  One should take the time to try to figure out what is happening and why.  As I wrote above, it certainly makes viewing more fun.

The reason I started in this way is because I would hate people to be put off from buying this recording.  The three leads are prime examples of actor/singers, and their performances really should be seen.  Dmitry Hvorostovsky as Giorgio Germont gives a restrained but powerful performance which leaves us in no doubt that this is a man who is used to command, who is never questioned, who is always in control and believes himself always right --until the final act.  Roberto Sacca as Alfredo Germont was a bit nervous at the start, but quickly got into it and portrayed a man who is soft and warm (which is what Violetta iis looking for) until he is crossed and then his passion is aroused and one can see the underlying fire that Violetta was also doubtless aware of.

But by far the star performer here (as in Lucie de Lammermoor) is Patrizia Ciofi as Violetta.  Her body language in the differing requirements of Act I, each part of Act II, and Act III is a marvel to behold.  It is such a strong performance that were the other two not so good, the production would be too one-sided.

Needless to state, the singing is first rate.  The orchestra under Lorin Maazel was also quite good, although because of the power of what was happening on the stage one tends not to pay too much attention to it.

All told, this is a production that should not be missed.  It is different in concept from other Traviatas; and even if you disagree with the basic premise, the acting and singing will hold you spellbound and perhaps will even provoke a tear or two.",1135555200,23,2608,4.572043010752688

Furthermore, hailed as the quintessential Verdi baritone, Renato Bruson thrills as Germont Sr. And, on a purely technical note for the DVD itself, if this country was a monarchy, then video director Brian Large would most definitely be deserving of a knighthood for the skill and artistry he brings to preserving wonderful opera productions such as this for posterity.
