8392554,5,B0039ZBLU6,"Linas Pullis is an incredible talented film maker and actor. Bass Ackwards is very well done and so was a film called ""Rainbow Time"", which is what made me go looking for more Lines films.  I would go as far as saying his work is potentially Academy Award material. I, for one, will be keeping my eyes open for that. =)",1479427200,,319,4.229508196721311
8392555,4,B0039ZBLU6,"A quirky, original, slice of life road movie filled with believable characters and an impressive debut for writer, diector, star Linas Phillips.",1411171200,,144,5.590909090909091
8392556,5,B0039ZBLU6,"Watched Bass Ackwards on a whim and don't regret it at all. Watching this gem is like drifting quietly in a boat down a river - you will enjoy the experience enormously if you take the time to look around you as you go. Linas Phillips gets the idea of the drifting road trip spot on and his frequent encounters along the way provide a series of vignettes which impress by their very non-spectacular nature - no serial killers, aliens, spies or bank robbers - just people of various ilks, each of whom contributes to the overall impressionist human picture Phillips is painting.
In all, this proved a very satisfying movie to watch and in the times we live in, one with a refreshingly mundane, and with it positive, outlook on life. Highly recommended.",1328486400,,751,4.611940298507463
8392557,2,B0039ZBLU6,"Somehow the trailer got me to rent this film. I suppose if you were out of gas, had no cell phone, and you were stuck at a campsite in the woods, and help was not due to arrive for a day or so, watching this would be better that doing NOTHING. Bu it is sooooo boring I started skipping ahead half way through hoping there was some excitement, some action or SOMETHING.

There are many, many films to buy or rent that should be on your list above this one.",1315267200,,455,4.055555555555555
8392558,2,B0039ZBLU6,"I know it is a road movie, but there is way too many shots of just driving for long periods.  Other than that, there is not a plot.  If you watch the DVD extras, you find that is the case.  They made it up as they went along.",1295481600,,225,3.6458333333333335
8392559,5,B0039ZBLU6,"I saw Bass Ackwards recently at Sundance, and it was phenomenal. The acting, done by many ""non-actors"" draws you in, and the writing and improvisation by the film's director and lead, Linas Phillips is heartwarming without being overly sentimental and funny without being cheap. Speaking of cheap, this film was made with a very small budget but looks quite beautiful. It's a road movie, and so it can meander at times, but I dare you to watch this film and come away feeling regret. You won't.",1264636800,2,494,4.755813953488372
