2324167,5,B0009VBTQY,Many people are calling Tony Jaa the Thai Jackie Chan but I think Jackie's got nothing on Tony. He does his own stunts and is just amazing. If you love an action movie this definitely won't disappoint.,1108252800,3,201,4.45945945945946
2324168,5,B0009VBTQY,"Well the plot sure isn't anything to write home about and the acting is not so hot either.  However, Tony Jaa is amazing.  Even it you don't like martial arts movies go and see it anyway.  This guy is gonna be huge.  There aren't very many people who can make up for such a weak story and there are even fewer that can physically do everything this man can do.  Go see it just to witness Tony Jaa defy the laws of physics.  Just amazing.",1108166400,3,437,4.08235294117647
2324169,3,B0009VBTQY,"The beginning of the film is very cultural, but shows a sinister side of Bangkok. Once landed in Bangkok, violence becomes normal. Tony Jaa is very impressive with his moves, but it is overshadowed by the everyday violence. Ting (Tony Jaa) meets his cousin Humlae, aka George, who shuns his rural roots for the fast life in Bangkok. Ting wants George's assistance finding the stolen Ong-Bak head, but George is more interested in how Ting can support his lifestyle via fighting.",1487203200,,478,4.91358024691358
2324170,1,B0009VBTQY,"This production looks like something out of the 1950's. Oh wait, Godzilla vs. Rodan was better than this.",1483574400,,105,4.888888888888889
2324171,5,B0009VBTQY,"i love this movie on so many levels but mostly because of the amazing fight scenes and the authentically simplistic story. The fight scenes are just pure gold... with street chase, tuk tuk change and the final fight sequence in the cave. It opened my eyes to the world of Muay Thai and Tony Jaa.",1482364800,,295,4.381818181818182

2324181,3,B0009VBTQY,"Nothing unexpected from the common asian productions.

The acting is a very rough. The plot is decent. The fight scenes are somewhat entertaining.

Definitely not a Jackie Chan, Jet Li, or Bruce Lee quality movie.

Since this was the first one maybe the new ones are better.",1478390400,,274,4.787234042553192
2324182,4,B0009VBTQY,I enjoyed the movie but I thought it was very bloody.  It brought back memories of another favorite martial artist.  Would have loved a more detailed explanation of the characters.,1478304000,,180,4.966666666666667

2324186,5,B0009VBTQY,"A great intro Tony Jaa and an overall excellent martial arts film, especially since muay thai is often represented well in the genre.  The plot is sort of hokey, but the action more than makes up for it.  Give it a watch if you enjoy martial arts movies.",1477958400,,254,4.270833333333333

2324190,5,B0009VBTQY,A demonstration of the human machine and spirit. Any limits one thought the human body had are dispelled in this action film.  Plot and drama take a back seat to this display of athleticism and martial arts in the raw.,1477699200,,218,4.45

2324195,3,B0009VBTQY,"This is an old movie that I had heard about but never seen. While the dialog was difficult at times and it was presented in a 4x3 aspect ratio, I did enjoy the flick. The story is classic old school where the hero is taught the beauty and form of the old ways that had ideals, values, morals and principals brought into physical form through training the body. Our hero is sent by his village elders to retrieve the idle that was stolen by bad greedy men who will stop at nothing to gain more money and power. This idle or god has been in the village for generations and is believed protection for the village and its people and the people cannot thrive with out it.

2324209,5,B0009VBTQY,"My God, this is an amazing movie! Tony Jaa has the most devastating knees I've ever seen! He beats the living snot out of so many people you will almost get tired of seeing bleeding men beg for mercy (almost). There's a scene where he enters a crime lord's home using only his knee. Then he uses both of his knees to introduce body guards to Sleepy Time. There's another scene where Johnny Nap Time (not his real name) took the ultimate nap with the help of Mr. Jaa's sleeping pill (knee). If Mui Tai kickboxing interests you, if you like to watch grown men get beaten, if you want to scream ""Damn!"" every time someone gets laughably injured, then Ong Bak is just for you!",1475625600,,672,4.341269841269841

2324211,4,B0009VBTQY,"For a low budget international action movie it was not bad. It reminded me of the early Bruce Lee movies. I loved the sub-titles in English at the bottom of the screen. Since the movie is all in Thai you have to read the dialogue. It was funny when an actor would moan and the sub-title would read, ""Thai Moan."" I am looking forward to watching Ong Bak 2.",1475539200,,355,4.159420289855072

2324221,3,B0009VBTQY,"The movie is a bit low budget and the story is something you would expect, that said, it's action packed and it has that old school martial arts kinda action which was really entertaining.

2324247,4,B0009VBTQY,Decent plot with heart. I'm guessing if your looking at this movie you've come for the Muy Tai and in that category it shines. Kind of feels like an eighties movie with all the instant replay on hits but otherwise great combat. Would watch again.,1474675200,,246,4.488888888888889

The gymnastic and martial art ability of the principle actor is the best I have ever seen, Bruce Lee is smiling like Buddha right now and Jet Li must be nodding yes!  The abilities of Japanom Yeerum (Tony Jaa) are showcased in this truly excellent martial arts film, now a favorite!  This is not a mythical showcase like Mortal Kombat, the story line is more roughly similar to Enter the Dragon. It has humor and stunts like some of my favorite Jackie Chan movies (Drunken Master) and Stephen Chow (Kung Fu Hustle),. This movie stands with the best of the genre.  I particularly like the quick replay of action sequences taken from different angles, expertly edited film.",1474502400,,688,4.7

Tony Jaa has me at Awe to say the least. I think Jackie Chan at his prime might not have been as good. Worth watching if you want to be impressed with a human doing things it looks like humans shouldn't be able to do.

I couldn't stand the high pitch shrieks that was the female characters voice. It also had a Horror Film type vibe which I hate, the whole WHY WOULD YOU GO THAT WAY!!!!!

2324645,5,B0009VBTQY,"Tony Jaa stars in this action packed martial arts fest that makes the Matrix shake in it's boots! THERE IS NO CGI IN THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT NEED IT. You will swear you are watching a superhuman being in action when you watch Tony Jaa. IMPOSSIBLE body movement resembling Par Kour meets Muay Thai. I guarantee you you have never seen anything like this! Tony Jaa is a real life superhuman! The story goes that in a small town in the Orient stands a beloved statue of Buddha. Criminals steal the statue leaving the town without their prayer life. A young warrior stands up to the criminals and starts the hunt to get their beloved statue back from the scum who stole it. The young man goes to Bangkok, Thailand  to fight the thiefs. Par Kour, Muay Thai, and acrobatics compared to Bruce Li, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan are the parts of this movie that will utterly AMAZE YOU! Tony Jaa is actually faster and more agile than any I just listed which sounds impossible but is actually true. As stated on the DVD case, we feel we must warn you. This is a VERY violent movie and IS NOT for kids! PREMIUM...VIOLENCE...PERSONIFIED. I cannot put into words or writing the level of gymnastics, acrobatics, and martial arts in this film! Mr. Jaa is a real...life...Spider-Man. See it to believe it!",1452211200,,1290,4.512820512820513

2324664,5,B0009VBTQY,"You know the saying, ""they don't make 'em like they used to""? Well they did in this film. It has all the stuff you love about old genuine action films. And the greatest thing is that, while some may consciously try to capture that magic, I think these filmmakers found it just by doing a great job. Astonishing skills by Jaa; his martial art techniques are amazing. The movie paints a nasty picture of Bangkok, though, which I already pictured as a metropolitan armpit. So it doesn't do well for Thailand's image. But it's a great story of a lone man fighting injustice.
I saw this because of first seeing Skin Trade, a great movie that came out this year about human trafficking. It stars Dolph Lundgren and Tony Jaa, among others. So I watched this to see more of Tony and am glad I did.",1433548800,,789,4.410958904109589

OMG, the introduction of Tony Jaa's fighting with a flying knee kick across the room was.... memorable LOLOLOL. Was a good mix of comedy relief and action. The film makes it a point to emphasise the country's (Thailand) heritage with their faith/culture etc. I consider this to be a classic to Muay Thai as synonymous with Bruce Lee to Kung Fu/Jeet Kun Do..",1419465600,,454,4.6875

All of that aside, Tony Jaa is UNBELIEVABLE.  I've seen tons of Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and other Kung Fu movies.  But some of the moves Tony Jaa does I have not seen anywhere.  And this movie was made 12 years ago!  Tony is on another level and it is a shame he didn't get more roles in Hollywood.",1393286400,,513,4.111111111111111

His best film is the Protector 1 there is a part 2 out but it hasn't came to america yet sadly i know it will kick ass and take names. The movie i got was in pretty good condition it had finger prints on the dvd and a few light damage to the back part of the case there where 2 little tears on the plastic part of the case.

2324727,4,B0009VBTQY,"Tony Jaa does phenomenally showing off the fighting style of Muay Thai and, along with most of the other fighters, is the reason I enjoyed the movie and gave it four stars out of five. The acting is definitely hit and miss and the CG effects definitely do not hold up after ten years. Along with the cheap acting, the story feels very lacking or nonsensical throughout the film. However, there are several awesome fights as well as some humorous points throughout which, in my opinion, more than make up for the poorer moments. All-in-all I absolutely recommend that every martial arts fan watches this and if you enjoy the story (and Tony Jaa) enough I would also recommend watching Ong Bak 2 and Ong Bak 3, although the quality of the fighting and showcase of Muay Thai may not be satisfactory in the two prequels.",1377907200,,816,4.595890410958904

I would say this bluray is even worse than the pretty bad DVD, except that I'm watching this on a larger display, so it's probably about the same.  I know many will say that picture quality doesn't matter with a martial arts movie, but it's pretty disappointing here, since the visuals really are beautiful throughout.  Ok, so what's so bad?  In a word, the video is just soft--incredibly soft, to the point that the picture often seems out of focus on a display > 55'.  It's ok otherwise; no horrible compression and color is alright, but it's just soft to the point of being only barely watchable on a large display.",1375833600,4,694,4.512

2324809,4,B0009VBTQY,"Ong-Bak is an exciting action film starring Tony Jaa. The story follows Ting as he journeys from fight clubs to caves to retrieve his village's Ong-Bak head, which was stolen at the beginning, for his people. Throughout the film, I saw many great, realistic fights and fast-paced chases with unbelievable stunts. Tony Jaa is a stunning force of pure power when he fights, and it's amazing. The film also brings some comedy with Humlae, the clumsy character that always needs to borrow money to pay someone else (we all have that one friend...) Although I enjoyed most of the film, I felt it had some flaws.

First of all, I felt the soundtrack was out of place. The story was serious and the soundtrack had a rap-feel throughout most of the film; it even ends with a rap song. (Not to say rap isn't serious, but I expected different.)

Also, the film seemed to drag on a bit. I felt the chase scenes were too long and could have been cut down. As spectacular as the chase scenes were, it got somewhat old after a while. The film runs at about an hour and forty-five minutes (1:45:??), by the way.

Overall, Tony Jaa's fighting skills are clearly the best part of the film. Fans of martial arts films have probably already seen it, but if you haven't, I highly recommend it. As of 6/10/12, Ong-Bak is available on Netflix Instant streaming with subtitles (didn't bother to check if the English dub was available, sorry.)",1339286400,,1419,4.578740157480315

This film is superb it is actually two parts so get the other disc too ONG BAK 3. But OMG the things he does in either film is without stunt doubles, and literally should be almost non-human. He really exemplifies the true meaning of human potential of the body and the brain. It is an awe striking action packed film of heroism redemption and triumph.

A couple of friends told me that I really haven't seen a martial arts film unless I've seen Ong-Bak, and the new and greatest martial arts actor Tony Jaa.  So, I purchased the film and watched it last night.  Now, I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but in my opinion, I wanted to turn the film off about half-way through, and watch some re-run on cable.  The movie was boring, the story was pretty lame, terrible acting, and except for one great kick in the beginning of the film, I really wasn't impressed with his ""screen"" fighting sequences.  Sure, this Tony Jaa is great jumping over things, but I really wasn't impressed with anything else.  Also, most of the movie was people running through the streets, or chasing each other in taxi-cycles. If you want to see a movie with great story, acting, and fight scenes, buy ""Ip Man""!",1309737600,4,941,4.571428571428571
2324834,4,B0009VBTQY,"Tony Jaa plays Ting, a peaceful villager who is sent off to the big city to retrieve the village's stolen religious relic, for without that religious relic, doom will befall the village. In the city, Ting is out of place and he naturally gets into trouble, loses what little money he has and runs afoul of the thieves who stole the relic. Thankfully, a villager's son lives in the city and he's able to act as Ting's reluctant guide. Fortunately for both Ting and his reluctant guide, Ting happens to be an expert martial artist and Muay Thai boxer.

The plot here is simple and predictable and the acting is just about passable, but neither of those are really important factors because this movie is a showcase for Tony Jaa, and as such it's a roaring success. The chase scenes and fight scenes are top notch and Jaa shines throughout. Whether or not he's going to be the next Jet Li as some suggest, I don't know, but I do know that Ong Bak: The Thai Warrior provides everything a fan of this genre is looking for. Best of all there's no wirework here which is refreshing for a change. This is an action-packed thrill ride that never drags.

Tony Jaa is new in my database. I saw a preview of a film and said ""huh let's give this TONY JAA a look. Well I am here to tell I am thoroughly impressed by what I saw of this Tony Jaa. He's agile and swift; and has kick ass moves. He is definitely not Jackie Chan nor a Chow Yun Fat. This kid comes out with the lightening moves of Muay Thai and defy defining leaps. He has Jackie's need for thrill and stunts and Chow Yun Fat's need for steadiness. BUT... this kid is the new invention of martial arts.",1302739200,,770,4.870229007633588

The story of the first Ong-Bak is a bit weaker and should not me compared with 2 & 3 (which are in a totally different time era).

For the first time we get to see ""Real"" fights with no wires or special effects. When I first saw the trailer for Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior I was sold immediately!! Bruce Lee has always been the best for me and I do love some of Jackie Chan's work. But for the first time I can truly say to anyone that we now have a new martial arstist master who not only has mastered his skills but also shows an unbelievable passion for his art. That comes across in his movies.

Everybody always criticizes the ""storylines"" but it's simple enough to follow and the action to go along with it is more than satisfying! Tony Jaa is the real deal! You won't regret adding his to your martial arts film collection! It's a classic now!

The fights are beautiful, the chase scenes are thrilling, and the comedy gets a bit of a chuckle.

Tony Jaa plays a rural villager who goes to the big city to recover something stolen from his village. In The Protector it's two elephants, and in Ong-Bak it's the head of the village god.

In both movies, in trying to recover the object he's after, Jaa's character falls into a much bigger web of criminal activity. He ends up facing off against a corrupt crimelord and his martial arts trained right hand man (Johnny Tri Nguyen in The Protector and Atthapong Pantanaunkul in Ong-Bak).

While these similarities are certainly not to the credit of The Protector, which came after Ong-Bak, the two movies are very different in the way they unfold and the kinds of fight sequences that are delivered. Ong-Bak isn't the sheer frontal assault that makes The Protector so amazing to watch, but that fact also means Ong-Bak is a more economical film (and that has pluses).

There are some amazing acrobatics on display in Ong-Bak, most notably in the scene where Jaa and co-star Petchtai Wongkamlao (who also appeared for comic relief in The Protector) are running from a crowd of goons. Also, there is an early scene in the village where Jaa is 'practicing forms', which is a nice way to have him show off his skills early on. However, the movie also contains the straight fight scenes fans of the genre want, most notably between Jaa and several adversaries in an illegal Bangkok fight club.

Jaa the actor is much less prominent part of the mix here. In this film, Jaa is primarily a martial artist. In fact, I question whether the number of lines of dialogue he is given gets very far into the double digits. Most of the speaking is handled by the always hilarious Petchtai Wongkamlao, supported by Pumwazree Yodkamol playing a tomboy street urchin whose relationship to Wongkamlao's character is something I still can't quite figure out.

While I could have lived without the Bangkok motorcycle-taxi chase scene, Ong-Bak is an entertaining ride. I'd probably say The Protector is the better movie, but Ong-Bak is the shorter, lighter, and more direct film and is definitely worth seeing.",1295740800,2,2351,4.838308457711443

2324843,3,B0009VBTQY,"Bottom-Line: ""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"" is great entertainment for fans of the martial arts, but it is no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

There is something about a movie featuring the Asian martial arts that just fascinates.  The raw power, the artistry of movement, the delicate ballet of strike, counterstrike, strike and repeat; it is a treat to behold and marvel at.  Who knew the human body was capable of such beautiful, yet dangerous feats?  And so it has been since I was in my early teens; I enjoy watching the fighting unfold upon the screen no matter how bad the story behind the fighting actually is.

Enter ""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"" featuring a new martial artist from Thailand, the lithe and spectacularly flexible and powerful Tony Jaa.

Story-Line

Written and directed by Prachya Pinkaew (The Protector, Chocolate), the premise of ""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"" is rather silly from the Western perspective.  When the head is stolen from the body of a Buddha in Ting's (Tony Jaa) rural village he journeys to Bangkok in order to retrieve it.

As it happens the thief is connected to a bar wherein the criminal element gamble over bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred fighting contests, overseen by a baddie in a wheelchair of all things.  Despite his best efforts Ting is drawn into the arena, as it were.  But that of course is only the beginning of the story.  The rest unwinds on the streets of Bangkok as Ting (Jaa) jumps over under, and through a number of objects not unlike Jackie Chan used to do.

My Thoughts

Yes, there are copious amounts of fighting in ""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"", but the movie is mostly a vehicle designed to showcase the unorthodox talents and martial arts abilities of Tony Jaa, whose proficiency in the martial arts draws natural comparisons to Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan and a host of other martial arts master who came before him to the silver screen.

While it's a safe bet that Tony Jaa probably will not be nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe anytime soon, the man is not in the acting business so-to-speak, he is in the kicking butt business and in that he excels.  He has an engaging presence on screen and has no problem carrying a movie that at its core is a very violent affair, so be aware.  But it is violence that is fascinating to watch unfold up on the screen as Jaa's style of martial arts is different from that which has come before much like Jet Li style of Kung Fu was unlike anything we had heretofore experienced.  Jaa's Thai style martial arts relies heavily on bashing with elbow, knee, and closed fist.  But, it's not violence alone that draws me in, it how it applied with lighting fast speed, and consummate skill.

""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"" is great entertainment for fans of the martial arts, but it is no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Next up Ong-Bak 2: The Beginning.",1292457600,,2857,4.7082494969818915
2324844,5,B0009VBTQY,"I love martial arts movies like ""Enter the dragon"" with Bruce Lee and ""unleashed"" with Jet Li. this movie falls in to the same place but you have to know that this is a different fighting style and all based on muay thai. Really cool movie though. I bought the movie based on the preview and amazon reviews and was not disapointed =)",1292198400,,333,4.301587301587301
2324845,2,B0009VBTQY,"When Ong-Bak first came out in the US, it was -the- martial arts movie to see. I remember working in a movie store and customers constantly asking for it. Granted, we only had two copies available, but whenever it'd come back, it'd be out within 30 minutes. One of the few perks of working there was getting to see movies a week before they came out, and I'd heard many things about Ong-Bak prior to its US release, so of course I rented it. Back then in 2005, I was impressed. I thought this was the best martial arts movie in the past decade. Watching it now though, and especially after seeing The Protector, I can see that Ong-Bak isn't 'non-stop action' as so many people claim. In fact, if you've never seen Tony Jaa in action, I highly recommend the sequel to this, or just go with The Protector. Ong-Bak here is more of 5-6 good fight scenes, and tons of boring story. That's not to say I don't care about stories in movies, but here, it's a waste of time. Just let us see the best martial artist in movies today do his thing already.

You want a story summary? This is easy- the head of a Buddha statue is stolen from a small village, and Ting, a Muay Thai warrior, is sent to find it in the big city. Ting goes through boss battle after boss battle and takes part in one of the most stupidly long car chase scenes in movie history. End.

That really is the basis of the story- give Tony Jaa motivation to fight a bunch of bad dudes. And it's fairly fun the first time around. When Jaa fights the Big Bear character, a big tough guy who's seemingly invincible, we see just how strong the little guy is. Tony Jaa really is this generation's Bruce Lee: his moves are incredible, speed and explosive energy unrivaled, and he does all of his own stunts without any wires, CG or stunt doubles. You can't say that about too many others in martial arts movies. It really does look like he's hitting every opponent with everything he's got, especially those elbow attacks. Jaa has such a diverse move set that it's hard to tell sometimes what's Muay Thai and what he took from other styles because the blending is so fluid. One of the things that I liked about Ong-Bak over The Protector, is that Jaa's character keeps his honor through the movie. He never resorts to dirty tricks or loses his temper to the point where it makes him hurt people even more than he already is.

I'd like to say more positive things about the movie, but it's tough after seeing the true non-stop action flying knee-fest: The Protector. Aside from the opening 10 minutes, I swear there was never more than 5 minutes of non-fight scenes there. Here, the fights make up maybe 25% of the movie. The rest is horrible acting from everyone involved. Ting stays with a guy named Humlae in the city, who's partners with either his girlfriend or daughter or sister (it's never really revealed who this girl is) in gambling and sneaky tricks. They try to get some comic relief out of these two, but it usually falls flat. Just as bad are the sappy sentimental moments, like where Ting hands over some jewelry a villager gave him before he left, but since the scene where he got it was over so quickly, it's hard to feel anything when he gives it away because there's no strong connection. I know it's pointless since this is a martial arts movie, but again, the majority of this movie is dialogue. But then there's the car chase. Hoo boy...this thing...it's basically a golf cart chase in the city with a bunch of thugs chasing after Ting in similar carts. This scene goes on for so long that it's crazy. There aren't any cool parts, and it keeps going, and going, and going. The first time you see it, you might have interest, figuring hey, there's gotta be a payoff, right? Keep hoping.

Here's where the rating drops even lower. The picture quality on the blu-ray is awful. Everything looks grainy, colors change in some scenes, and there's edge halos. 'might as well be watching it on vhs at this rate. The audio's slightly better, though most of the movie is center focused. Basically, this is the dvd carried over to a blu-ray disc with little, if any upgrades.

All the special features from the dvd are back too. The Selected B-Roll is a collection of raw footage of certain scenes like *sigh* the cart chase, one of the fights, and the infamous fire kick shot. It's cool just to see that these are actually being done live and not worked on in a studio later for special effects. But the best special feature is the Tony Jaa demonstration. It's just a few minutes of him doing all of his moves live before a big audience, and if you needed any more proof that he's the man, this is all you need. See for yourself that he really can fly around in-person like he does in the movie. The Eight Movements of Muay Thai is good for any martial artists or people who want to know more about the style, as it's Jaa breaking down the moves. Last is this hilarious French rap music video, and you gotta see this to believe it. The rappers talk about how they wanted Tony to fight them with his Muay Thai in the video, while they were fighting him with their words. 'kinda funny when you figure how well that'd work at any other time. The song'll get stuck in your head because it's catchy. Not in a good way, but it'll at least make you laugh.

I'm not trying to be a hater of this movie. I liked it a few years ago, but now I don't let the 'omg tonie jaw' fanboy-ness blind me. You're better off just searching for clips of the fights from this movie, then moving on to The Protector, which I consider Jaa's best movie as far as action goes. This is more of a demo to show you what he was capable of early in his career, which is still impressive. But for a movie, you can do a lot better.

A simple country fella, with fighting skills, goes to the big city and destroys a gangster and his crew. Back in 1971 kung fu action like this had never been seen on the American screen. It was electrifying. And to be honest, in a crowded saturday night movie theatre (double featured with ""The Omega Man"") the loopy dubbed english dialogue, the simple film style, and the seemingly impossible kicks and moves were greeted with laughs. But it was the seed from which a legend would grow. I felt the same excitement while watching Ong-Bak. A simple honorable man, with incredible skills, cleans house. Using a combination of Muay Thai and moves inspired by studying Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li films Tony Jaa along with a strong base of acrobatic skills simply astounds.

Some of the action that he does, they show it to you from 2 - 4 different angles before they leave that scene, it is that awesome.

The action is great, the acting maybe not quite so much, but no body watches these kinds of movies for it's superb acting and dialogue, right?

I can safely say this is as bad as it gets. little to no upgrade from the DVD. infact, many upscaled DVD's produce greater video quality. A fine action outing, though rather amature especially in scenes like the the go-kart chase. It shows tremendous potential from now action star Tony Jaa, which we have seen fulfilled in more superior films such as Tom Yum Goong (The Protector) and this films sequel Ong Bak 2. Although we have yet to see his real acting chops, no one is watching these films for that. Still, If you own the DVD there is absolutely no reason to upgrade to BD. If you don't own the DVD and cant find it anywhere for a cheaper price then you might want to hold off on a purchase. I suggest sticking with Ong Bak 2 which has an infinitely better transfer though still not perfect.",1268265600,5,968,4.318681318681318
2324864,5,B0009VBTQY,"I was in karate for 9 years and a 3rd degree black belt before my dojo closed down, so it might come as no surprise that everytime I watch this film I can't help but throw a kick or two in front of the mirror. Ong Bak is without a doubt one of the best martial arts films period. Like most in this genre, the story and dialogue are not the best (it's not terrible either), but boy do the fight scenes make up for it. I guarantee you have never seen stuff like this.

As much as I love Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li, Tony Jaa makes them look much less impressive. Okay, I'll give Bruce Lee a pass since he did his thing in the 70's and made martial arts films a household name. We all know Jackie Chan does all his own stunts (at least when he was younger), but so does Jaa, and without the help of any wires or CGI.

If you are like me and sick of seeing people flying around through the treetops and fighting, you will get nothing less than amazingly realistic and brutal fight scenes, complete with more knee and elbow strikes than you can count. Not only can this man kick some booty, he easily glides over cars, runs on top of people's shoulders, jumps through a tight gap made of barbed wire, flips, rolls and jumps in every possible direction.

I own his other two movies, The Protector and Ong Bak 2, and both have some great action as well, but Ong Bak is his best film overall. Whether you are a fan of martial arts or action movies, this is a must buy.

The DVD quality could be better, but from what I read, the Blu-ray isn't a huge improvement.",1266537600,3,1560,4.121710526315789
2324865,3,B0009VBTQY,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time because of the action.

I was fortunate to be able to obtain an unedited Thai version a few years ago.  The stunts and fighting are really up there.

Unfortunately, the US release is not.  The picture quality on the US DVD version isn't great (the colors are washed out) and the music is TERRIBLE.  Had I known that there was going to be this horrible over-dubbing of crappy music, I'd have skipped it (though it was a steal at $5).

I realize that the traditional Thai music at times doesn't mix will with Western tastes of music, but the fact that they LITERALLY just put the new music over the original track instead of remixing it is painful.  There are times I can hear the original music CLEARLY behind it all.  And then there are times that you can't really hear the sound effects because of the crappy dance music.

I can't remember for sure, but it feels like some of the fight scenes have been edited.  It's been a few years since I watched the Thai version in full, but I feel like some shots were cut out.",1266105600,,1063,4.296482412060302
2324866,4,B0009VBTQY,"If you're looking at this item, you probably already know all about Ong Bak. Awesome fight sequences that are about as real as you can get - no stunt doubles, wires or CG, just pure action. Seeing some of the moves in the film is really amazing, and it introduced many to the incredible Tony Jaa. I've been a big fan of it for years and was really excited to hear about a Blu-Ray release was coming.

Unfortunately, this one just doesn't make the cut.

First the specs on the disc - BD-25 (single layer), 1.85:1 widescreen, English and Thai 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio tracks (up from Dolby Surround English and Dolby 5.1 Thai on the DVD). English/Spanish subtitles and 18MBPS bitrate AVC.

I had a feeling there were bad things to come when the Blu-Ray was announced 12 days before it's release (to coincide with Ong Bak 2 on Blu-Ray). My feeling were correct and it seemed like a last-minute effort to port it to Blu-Ray for some extra sales.

Popping in the Blu-Ray, you see some nice, clear visuals/menus.. until the movie starts. At that point everything turns to heavy grain, some rainbowing can be seen, and overall you get a pretty unclear/un-sharp image that suffers from some crushed blacks (when darks get to a point that they lose all detail). A very ugly picture, and something that seems more of a DVD-quality release (and in fact, many DVD's seem to be even sharper/more detailed than this). It's almost as if the camera was out of focus throughout the film. I'd rank it near the bottom tier of Blu-Ray picture quality, and this movie is only from 2003!  Fox has had a history of releasing some sub-par quality blu-ray's, and this is no exception.

Now I'm sure you're asking - that's horrible! Why did you give it 5 stars??

Well, after seeing how badly it looked I decided to pop in my Ong Bak DVD - at that point I realized just how much of an improvement there was. The DVD had terrible edge-enhancement, artifacting and other obvious problems. It really made the Blu-Ray seem like a vast improvement, despite how badly it looked.  It's hard to say where the issue lies - is it with the filmmakers (poor quality film/handling?) or Fox (for poor mastering?)  Either way, it's unlikely we'll see anything better in the future, and for that reason (and the noticeable improvement over the very-poor DVD), I'd recommend it. (tip: Fox titles tend to drop in price - keep an eye out for sales to pick this one up)

It's also worth noting that this is still the ""international"" cut of the film (with soundtrack changes, storyline changes). A nice extra would have been to have the original cut included (but maybe the rights just aren't owned by Fox), similarly to how Ong Bak 2 has 2 different cuts of the film on the Blu-Ray.

The extras from the DVD appear to have been carried over to the Blu-Ray.

I hate to recommend the product when it's 3-4x the cost of the DVD, but as bad as it looks there is a noticeable improvement over the DVD. Just don't expect to see ""Blu-Ray Quality""",1265155200,10,2992,4.530612244897959

Once you've seen all of Tony Jaa's impressive repertoire of tricks -- leaping and vaulting over obstacles, running along the shoulders of his enemies, and throwing various jumping, flying knee- and elbow-strikes -- the physical altercations become a bit repetitive because you've seen him do it before, but I didn't find that this diminshed my enjoyment of the movie too much.

2324881,2,B0009VBTQY,"I would give it 2.5, but I rounded down to two because of all the fives on Amazon.  I read the reviews and was excited after seeing some parts on youtube, but I was left disappointed.  I normally watch films like these with subtitles, but my wife doesn't like that so I used the English dubbing, but I doubt that had anything to do with the atrocious music.

I am a big martial arts fan.  I must have watched ""Enter the Dragon"" 100 times as a kid and loved Bruce Lee's other movies.  Later ""Rumble in the Bronx"" renewed my zeal and I eagerly watched Chan's other films, the old and new ""Iron Monkey"" movies, ""Wing Chun"", ""Tai Chi Master"", the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series and many more.  I saw this film and was excited by all the rave reviews.  This movie doesn't use wire work like many of Jet Li's films and I was expecting something akin to the excellent ""Chocolate"", but this movie has several flaws.

Before going through the flaws, I would like to say that the fight scenes are pretty exciting.  It was nice to see the Muai Thai fighting style which I was unfamiliar with.

First, the plot is poor.  The ""quest"" is for a poor country martial artist to travel to the big city and recover the head of a statue that the village worships.  Apparently they need it back to end the drought that is plaguing their village, but the drought must have started while the statue was whole because he seems to leave almost immediately after the head is stolen.

Second, the music is poor.  It is bad enough that I wish I could have turned on subtitles and turned the volume on my TV off.  I've never heard a score this bad in a movie before.

Third, the movie frequently stops for two replays whenever Jaa does some interesting move (such as jump over some spikes or do the splits sliding under a truck).  Seeing the same move (which frankly didn't seem that impressive) three times took me out of the movie and ruined the flow of the action.  Switching to slow motion from a different angle would have been much better. Jaa performs several acrobatic feats in one chase scene through alleys and streets, but his pursuers keep up with him, I wonder if that is because he was doing those things three times :).

Fourth, several things are just weird.  [some minor spoilers] One instance is that Jaa is basically forced to fight when he steps out in the open towards the clerk that takes bets while the announcer is asking for challengers, yet he is surprised.  Then he gets the clerk to give back the villager's money that his cousin had stolen and bet, but refuses the prize money for winning the fight.  What clerk would just give the money to someone that hadn't bet it when it had been lost?  Another thing is the part that guns play in the movie.  There's one scene near the end when a few people have guns and it is fairly realistic when they avoid being shot.  But later a big fight plays out and the big bad guy only pulls out a gun at the end to shoot him, why didn't the others in there have guns and why did nobody use them earlier?  Another time the bad guy goes through a lengthy speech and tells them that he is now their god and they should obey him.  Then he leaves with instructions to ""kill them quietly"".  It just seemed like he was going to keep them around and use them somehow, but I guess not.  This one might be due to dubbing.  I still don't get why he didn't go to the address he had for the guy that took the head, either immediately when he got to the city or when he was separated from his cousin a few times.  I wonder what he was doing then...

Lastly, except for Jaa, the acting is pretty bad.

How anyone can give this movie five stars is beyond me.  It has severe deficiencies in directing, acting, plot, score and editing.  Don't take my word for it, buy it yourself and then post an honest review.  I was sorry to have made my wife stay up late and watch it with me, and glad when she went to bed 2/3 the way through.",1250812800,5,3952,4.257718120805369
2324882,4,B0009VBTQY,"Stunt-man-turned-actor Tony Jaa makes his starring debut as Ting, a peaceful young villager in Thailand who must make his way to the big city of Bangkok to retrieve the stolen head of Ong Bak, the village's beloved Buddha statue.  Upon his arrival he is instructed to enlist the help of his cousin Humlae (Petchtai Wongkamlao), a selfish gambling addict who defected from the village years earlier.  The statue's head was taken by a low-level drug dealer named Don, as a gift for a powerful gangster with a rather impressive collection of Buddha heads... and a wicked case of throat cancer.

What else?  Just fights.  Lots of fights.  Brutal fights.  Jaw-dropping fights.  As good as they are, they do start to get repetitive after a while, with elbow after elbow applied to the top of bad guys' heads.  Luckily Jaa manages to crank it up a couple of notches for the finale with some fancier kicks, weapons, and stunts.

Jaa is admittedly a big fan of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan and it shows.  Apart from the brutality of the fights, Chan's influence is a little more noticeable, especially during chase sequences, which is where the majority of the film's silliness comes in.  If you've never seen Jaa in action, this is probably the best place to start.  After a view or two, you'll know when to depress the fast forward button and enjoy the best parts, of which there are many.

The DVD from Magnolia has a wonderful widescreen picture with a couple of cool special features.  I could do without the rap video, but Jaa's live performance and Muay Thai feature are very cool, as is the behind-the-scenes segment.  Languages include Thai and English with subtitles in English and Spanish.  If you can't handle dumb then steer clear, otherwise this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Followed by an unrelated sequel.

The plot and the dialogues are a joke. But who cares?

It's definitely worth buying for martial art fan.",1240531200,2,338,4.265625
2324884,1,B0009VBTQY,"This is a review of the DVD itself, not the movie. The movie's as others say -- it's something you watch for the action sets, not the story or script.
This movie didn't seem too different than the American release, and it still has that annoying message to Spielberg that's scrawled on a wall during the early fight/chase sequence.
I got this expecting to see the moving scene where the female lead character's sister dies at the hospital, but that wasn't there, just as it's missing the American release. That was one of the more powerful scenes in the movie, but instead all we get is the sister walking out of the hospital to get kidnapped.
Disappointing, if I could get back my money, I would. Now I'm stuck with almost 20 bucks less and a DVD I won't be watching again.",1240358400,6,774,4.457746478873239

I mean, he's up there with Bruce Lee. No disrespect, but the fighting and skills displayed here are awesome. If you are into good action and fighting, just buy this movie. You will NOT be let down. Muay Thai looks insane. I'd never seen this style of fighting before, but it's very unique and crazy to watch. I need to get The Protector next! lol",1237507200,,522,4.282828282828283

In any other movie, showing instant replays of the same stunt three or four times in a row would be really cheesy. But for some reason when Ong-Bak does it, every replay manages to be cooler than the last. And the pacing is good, too; the action builds over the course of the movie, with quite the finale. Definitely a good movie to watch with a bunch of guys and a pizza. The acting, of course, is mediocre. But its not intolerably so. In fact, for a foreign film, its surprisingly good. Asian films are notorious for their melodramatic acting. Anyway, you don't watch this movie for the acting.

The fights do not have quite the diversity that The Protector does, but Ong-Bak still runs circles around most other martial arts flicks.

This film is a 3 star at best only because I can see their, the film makers, struggle to develope a format to justify some of the crazy fight scenes. Some of these fights were good to watch but the over the top story line got in the way most of the time, martial art films don't have to get  into heavy stories because the focus is on the fighting but this one didn't work for me.",1204848000,,587,3.8916666666666666

2324905,3,B0009VBTQY,"Tony Jaa has an interesting fighting style and on-screen charisma.  That wasn't quite enough to carry this film, though.  Once you get past the poor script, the poor acting, the poor camera work and the poor lighting, you've basically got something that resembles an early 80s action film instead of the slick new films being made today.

Jaa is impressive with his rough and tumble style of Muay Thai fighting, much tougher than Van Damme's style with lots of knees, elbows and head slams thrown in.  Unfortunately, he does more running and jumping in this movie than fighting.  When he does fight, it's either against the type of skinny, scrawny extras who always got mowed down by Bruce Lee by the dozens, or it's against villians who look like the boss characters in 80s video games.  They have names like Mad Dog and Big Bear, they look more weird than tough, and they only have one or two good moves.

Another quirk about this film was the fact that some of the fight scenes seemed to be sped up, making them look like old black and white Keystone Cops sequences.  The fact that most of the fighters appear to be about 3 feet tall on screen made these fight scenes resemble a couple of little kids slapping each other on a school playground.  Maybe that's just the Thai style of film making, though...",1202428800,,1307,4.575107296137339
2324906,4,B0009VBTQY,"Ong-Bak is a throwback to the days when martial arts movies didn't use cgi and fast-cutting to make their stars look good. This is classic wide-shot, single-take, that's-GOTTA-hurt stuff that will leave your gob well and truly smacked. If anything, leading man and crash test dummy Tony Jaa is almost UNDER-hyped - he has the power of Bruce Lee, the speed of Jet Li and the acrobatic agility of Jackie Chan. He also has the voice of Michael Jackson, but I wouldn't say it to his face, oh no. Plot and characterisation may be at a minimum - country boy comes to Bangkok to retrieve stolen head of village Buddha from artefact smugglers: lots of people get hurt - but it has some of the most impressive and exhilarating action scenes in decades. The no-wires, no-cgi, no-doubles stunts are a mixture of breathtaking and foolhardy - this isn't just don't try this at home, kids, stuff, this is don't even try this on a movie set with ambulances standing by, some of which you could never get away with on a US movie set (or any other country with even the lowest form of health and safety standards). One film you definitely don't want to see in FeelaRound.

The cream of the extras is a compilation of Jaa recreating several of the stunts for the film live at displays in shopping centres just to prove that there really was no faking!",1198800000,,1333,4.531120331950207
2324907,5,B0009VBTQY,"One night I was wandering around in the DVD section on Amazon and discovered this movie. Since I had been to Thailand and the reviews were great, I was curious enough to order ""Ong-Bak."" Now mind you, I am a retired English teacher, female, and not given to violence. However, I give this movie five stars for several reasons.

First, of course, is Tony Jaa, an amazing Muay Thai martial artist. Other reviewers compare him with the greats, but I say he is unique, in a class of his own and still young, thus has opportunity to develop his art further. Let me repeat, Tony Jaa is amazing!

However, in addition to Tony Jaa's talents, the movie itself is absolutely worth whatever you spend to get it. The action sequences, not including the martial arts fights, are so cleverly put together. The very first action is an rush by young men in a village to climb a huge tree to retrieve a scarf from its top. Because it is a Thai contest, a cultural thing, American audiences had to be agape at this action. I know I was. Ting (Jaa) wins.

Here is a progression of other action scenes so entertaining:
*Ting and Humlae running through the side streets of Bangkok, trying to escape bullies out to harm them. Hilarious and amazing.

*The race of the tut-tuts. Those little three-wheeled carts are like horse and buggies in New Orleans, a tourist thing. To see them in a ""car chase"" and how they crash and tumble is also hilarious.

*The fights: Some of the early fights are so funny. Big Bear (Australian?) with his Howard Stern hair, the quick-legged Japanese(?) fighter, and the incredible fighter(?) who uses accoutrements to attack Ting: picture frames, broken bottles, tables, chairs, a neon sign, an electric cord, a small refrigerator, a knife--and still loses.

From this point the fights become progressively more dangerous. It is about mid-point in the movie when the serious stuff begins and all fights intensify. The viewer sees Muay Thai in life-threatening action.

This is an incredible film with incredible action, humor, ""car chases"" unlike any you have ever seen, and a satisfactory ending. Highly recommended for its uniqueness all around!! Be sure to watch the Special Features section. It is worth the price of the video! And watch out for more of Tony Jaa!",1198368000,2,2273,4.753807106598985
2324918,5,B0009VBTQY,"When you put Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Bruce Lee in one, you will get Tony Jaa. This was an amazing movie, with amazing fighting scenes and  good acting by Jaa.

2324919,5,B0009VBTQY,"This movie has some incredible stunt work, the jump through the hoop of barbed wire alone was worth the price of the movie, this guy is really good. The plot is nothing special, but, who watches these for the plot?",1191456000,,214,4.375
2324920,4,B0009VBTQY,"There are a handful of movies that have true raw martial arts skills shown and not so much special effect talents demonstrated. Bruce Lee is one that comes to mind most. Although I enjoy Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal's movies and they showed their talents, there were certainly more special effects and stunts than true raw skills demonstrated. This movie shows raw talent and will remind you of the early Bruce Lee movies. I imagine we will see Tony Jaa again soon. This foreign film has English subtitles. Unfortunately they are only for hearing impaired, so you will read it when birds chirp and techno music plays. A minor complaint but a bit distracting. Overall this will appeal to fans of martial arts movies. mainly. I suggest you rent it if you enjoy foreign movies or martial art movies.

Tony Jaa plays Ting, a Thai whose village is invaded by thugs that steal the head of their Buddha. His village pleads with him to get it back since there is a festival coming and he won the tree climbing contest and is a known accomplished fighter. The villagers pitch in and give him all their money for his journey. He goes to Bangkok to look for the men and he ends up visiting an Uncle who is into gambling. He takes Tings money and gambles it away. Ting must then fight in competitions to recover it and the head of the Buddha. Very thrilling fight scenes in different locales. The movie gives a good feel for life in Thailand and has good production values. As for critics, considering the sheer number of martial arts moves in this movie I was in awe of the very few slightly missed hits. Choreographing this kind of movie is a nightmare because if you aren't doing full on hits it is more difficult to show realistic fight scenes. So my hat is off to Jaa for so many moves and so few mistakes.",1188086400,,1801,4.474164133738602

2324922,5,B0009VBTQY,People got to see this movie. Tony Jaa is fantastic in martial arts stunt but true. He is the new Bruce Lee. Now I'm interested on learning the Muay Thai myself.,1178409600,,161,4.225806451612903
2324923,5,B0009VBTQY,"The most successful movie in Thai cinematic history is also the best ""real world"" martial artist film in the past decade.  With all the fantastic wire work in Iron Monkey, Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon it's nice to swing the pendulum back the other way toward what I grew up with, Bruce Lee style raw and powerful, full contact fight scenes.  Tony Jaa is the next Bruce Lee and will surpass his predecessors Jackie Chan and Jet Li.  He has Li's Technical skill and speed, Chan's stunt work and acrobatics and Lee's brutal style with no wires. Jaa is the real deal

This is his first film (staring role at lease, Jaa was a stuntman before this) and this movie rocks the entire way though.  There are only four main fight scenes but they are so well done and with so much intensity it feels like a Bruce lee film or early Jackie Chan (serious Chan, not buster Kenton Chan).  Jaa does all his own stunts, no CGI, no wires.  Jaa incorporated Thai Boxing (Muay Thai) which is not well know but is jaw dropping and painfully brutal.  You can see every bone crushing blow and truly believe it could inflict some real damage.  The music is great and really ups the pace in these hard core action scenes.  Like any good Jackie Chan movie this one also features Jaa is various, seemingly unbelievable stunts that are truly unique to Jaa.  You just have to see it to believe he can do what he can do.

The finally to this movie is amazing, the scene in the cave, raw and so brutal and is shot beautifully with just the right amount of diffused lighting that gives the dark yet visible fight scene and lets you get the mood and still see every blow, crisp and clear.

Everyone likes to rag on the plots of these films; if you're watching this for the plot then you're an idiot.  Sit back and enjoy seeing the beginning of the new king of movie martial arts, Tony Jaa.",1175731200,,1865,4.368115942028986

My son and daughter who are in Thailand with their mother while I am working in Iraq loved it, guess what? The whole family loved it,.. (Their Asian) The movie comes in English, Thai, and other languages, and also has subtitles so you can watch it in the parent language which I feel makes for a better show.

2324929,5,B0009VBTQY,"From a small Thai village the statue of the revered deity Ong Bak is vandalized ... his head is stolen. The film shows how the eight moves of Muay Thai are executed by Ting, the best maritial arts fighter in the village who is sent to the city to find and return this sacred object. The local priest admonishes Ting to use only peaceful means because the moves can be deadly. Ting is given money and valuables by the villagers who aresimple and poor but faithful he will succeed ... He is advised to seek the help of a cousin, who lives in the city. Ting finds his cousin who is less than enthusiastic to receive a visitor from his village. The cousin is ashamed of his village roots, he has taken on an American name and has a girlfriend whom he likes to impress that he is ""cool"" ... unfortunately, he also has a gambling habit that has gotten him into deep debt with the underworld bosses.

After the cousin stole Ting's money and gambled it away, Ting ends up fighting goons sent by the local gangster to put fear into his cousin, essentially pay up or risk permanent injury. Ting's fighting prowess impresses his cousin who gets the idea to have him fight at a local arena against the best fighters where betting takes place. The cousin is certain he will recoup his losses ...Ting agrees on the condition afterwards his cousin will help find Ong Bak. While the story line is basic, the fighting scenes captivate and capture the viewer's attention and hold it throughout the film.

The scenes where Tony Jaa jumps over several produce carts during a chase in the city while knives are thrown at him is astonishing. Another phenomenal scene involves a huge number of three wheeled taxis which are driven by Ting's would-be captors as he fights them off while he is riding in a moving taxi. When they come to the end of the freeway there is an unexpected drop off ... like the edge of a cliff, the freeway is under constructed and incomplete. There is an explosive ending related to the capture of the gangster boss and the *surprise* location of an unprecedented number of Buddha heads which were stolen. This DVD has great extra features, such as a live performance of martial arts by Tony Jaa on stage in Paris during the opening of his film. It also has a rap music video which incorporates phenomenal martial arts performed by Tony Jaa. Some behind the scenes footage features the creation of specific stunts within the film.

2324930,4,B0009VBTQY,"Watch this movie for the incredible action scenes and talent of Tony Jaa. It's very straight forward. This movie never pretended to have a great story line or a rich complex plotline. This movie is purely for the martial artist, or just the martial arts fan, to see some extremely well done stunts and brutally well done fight scenes. Period.

Being a martial arts person myself and having seen literally dozens of martial arts films I can say that this is one of the best done films in the genre involving no stunt doubles, no wires, and none of that other flying nun, cinematography stuff. Do not compare this movie to 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers'. It is not meant to be. Those movies had good storylines, but this movie is meant to be pure realistic action with special effects being kept to a minimum. This movie's purpose is to let the viewer feel the impact of each and every elbow strike, knee strike etc. That's the goal of this movie, for the audience to feel the impact the action has. Not to wow the viewer with wirework and see flying Chinese girls with pretty hair.",1169510400,,1085,4.50761421319797
2324931,3,B0009VBTQY,"For many, Ong-Bak is the very definition of cool, even that insipid quote from Aint It Cool News says so but now and then I somehow manage to avoid the hype and praise and be able to watch a film objectively and not dwell on certain things. Ong-Bak is another one of those martial arts films where we see athletic people do cringe-inducing stuff, not in a ""Fear Factor"" way but we know that if we attempt that, we'll fail miserably. We have Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chow-Yun Fat and Jet Li and now we add Tony Jaa who shows off incredibly limber movements but he just is in a film that just seems faulty.

In a small village, the head of the Buddha statue, Ong-Bak is stolen and sent to retrieve it is Ting, a gifted martial artist. Going to the city, he finds the head but it's in the possession of a crime boss who bets on fighters in a brutal arena where almost anything goes. Befriending a former village dweller named George and his friend Muay, he has to retrieve the statue head back and go through many obstacles and many more men to do it.

Now, the problems and strengths of this film all lie in one scene which is arguably its best: outrunning a whole group of bad guys and the only way to do it is to jump or clear obstacles. Some range from hopping over people or clearing the roof of cars but wait, it doesn't end there, he jumps in a crouched position through a small barbed wire wreath AND he hops on the shoulders of others AND he slides in the splits position under a car...yes...UNDER. But that's not the best part(or worst). You see, either they wanted to make sure you saw it, or they wanted to do a replay to show you how he did it or just be indulgent, they actually replay the move and it gets kind of silly.

When he fights though, it's not as choreograph looking like Jackie Chan but on the other hand, it looks brutal. Quick cuts, fast punches, it's all in there. The one thing though is that you'll notice there's a lot of knees to chests and fists to the top of the head. Most likely the fighting style but it gets kind of old when he does another kick to a chest. Then in the middle of a brutal fight, a bad guy decides to pull a gun. Was he buying his time and toying with him? Or did the filmmakers say ""let's give him a gun when we feel he should have it"". Now if it sounds like I'm super negative I'm not. The film is neat to look at, seeing a body performing all this stuff but at the same time, as a film this just looks undercooked.

It's worth a rental, although I wouldn't say you should buy the thing. It's not a movie like, say, Crouching Tiger or Hero where multiple viewings help, not only for the fight scenes but also the story. Here it's just ""enjoy the acrobatics, and oh yeah, I guess you can watch the story too"".",1168905600,,2761,4.164794007490637

Tony Jaa's Muay Thai style of martial arts is less visually fluid or stylized than traditional Shaolin Kung Fu or Wu-Shu. Muay Thai's appeal is in its brutally powerful movements. There is nothing subtle about a vertical elbow strike to the top of an opponent's skull. ""Ong-Bak"" successfully showcases Jaa's athleticism and martial arts prowess. However he is not an actor who does his own stunts, but rather a stunt man who happen to act. The film-writing, storyline, and acting by the supporting cast are horrendous. There is no convincing or endearing character-development to speak of. Mere caricatures fill the scenes along with a script that could have come straight out of an episode of ""The Power Rangers"".

The movie was great, very entertaining, and has an old traditional story which is a different and welcome change from most of the story-depth-lacking movies of today.  This is a martial arts film that must be experienced.  I just saw Tony Jaa's second film, The Protector in theaters, and it is even better than this one, Ong Bak.  Tony jass is fantastic and his martial arts movies are wonderful, and the reminiscient stories remind of my past since I came from a similar type of poor, small village in another country.  Keep up the great work Tony Jaa for doing what you do best. And thanks to the film production companies that brought this omvie to the USA. As for the music in the film. I wasn't that happy with RZA's music in this movie.  It didn't fit well.",1160006400,2,1074,4.411167512690355
2324949,4,B0009VBTQY,"Recently realizing that Jackie Chan and Jet Li are about done with movie making for the most part, I always wondered if there was anyone who could take over.  Chan and Li are one of a kind and the best out there.  Fortunately, Tony Jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own.  The first thing I like about Tony Jaa is he is an expert in Muay Thai fighting, something new and original for the good guy in a movie.  The next thing I like is that he fights like Jet Li and does stunts like Jackie Chan, though once again he adds his own originality quite often.

Ong Bak is pure action excitement - don't expect a deep story and do expect horrible English dubbing that is just down right annoying (you can still switch to subtitles with Thai spoken if desired).  If these 2 things don't matter to you, this movie just plains rocks.  Its a bit slow here and there, but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights, an incredible club brawl fight, tons of stunts and chases, a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars, a ring fight, and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts, lasting for a good 10 minutes.  I also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid-back hip hop beats.

I'm pleased to say that with newcomer Tony Jaa to the world of martial arts films, the loss of Chan and Li someday soon won't be as bad.  Ong Bak is brilliant action and originality. The only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing, which Chan and Li movies do much better.",1159401600,2,1615,4.248366013071895

asian martial artists), is so balanced in endless actions.

Around 5'-10"" in his height (I suppose), which is a little  taller than Bruce Lee (and much taller than Jet Li), Tony's stern figure presents a male structure that's stronger than a dancer, swifter than a fighter.",1155772800,4,466,4.716049382716049
2324954,4,B0009VBTQY,"Everything you read in other reviews about Tony Jaa and ""Ong Bak"" is absolute truth - there are no wires or CG. And sometimes it seems this guy really outdoes both Jackie Chan and Jet Li (I'm saying ""sometimes"" and ""it seems"" just out of respect to Tony's Chinese colleagues who are still awesome and mindblowing). Jackie and Jet, please do not retire after watching Tony Jaa's movies!

The story-line is rather naive here and the one we've seen pretty often in martial arts cinema. But the plot is actually of no importance - if it was the film wouldn't get that high ratings from viewers. It's Jaa's moves that draw everyone's attention to the movie and what he does is just outstanding. I bet you'll be replaying most of the scenes in slow motion to see how they're done.

But to be honest ""Ong Bak"" didn't impress me as much as another Tony Jaa's film ""Tom yum goong"" which was released two years later - in 2005. Its plot also doesn't matter much and it practically copies ""Ong Bak's"" but believe me - it's by far more spectacular and Tony Jaa demonstrates much more of his abilities there. If ""Ong Bak"" is mostly about fighting, ""Tom yum goong"" shows us more of Jackie Chan stuff like jumping and wall-climbing. Although some like it just fighting considering it more brutal :)

Anyway try to catch ""Ong Bak"" even if you're not a big fan of martial arts cinema - you'll be utterly impressed. The thing that impresses me is that Tony Jaa is very young and he's already rather famous. Not like Chan or Li who appeared in relatively big-budget movies after they've been working in Hong-Kong for so many years. I think Tony will be in Hollywood or under the wing of Luc Besson in no time and he's still got so many years to surprise and amaze us.",1155513600,4,1748,4.45625

Yes, there's some nice moves, some nice acrobatics, but that's about it. Then, you get to the caverns... Oh boy, are you in for a treat if you like your martial arts fast, furious and real (no wires, etc). This parallels Lee's 'Enter the Dragon' in many ways - the finale incorporating fights against mutliple adversaries, through caverns, using a variety of weapons, before the final one-on-one battle with the baddie. Jaa's style isn't as beautiful as Lee's, in general - lots of knees and elbows - but when this guy wants to kick! He just hangs in the air for about a day at a time, legs flying out in all directions. Incredible. And NO WIRES.

This movie has the most ridiculous stunts and fight scenes that I have ever seen.  I keep hearing about Jet Li and how awesome he is, but I would never know because all of his movies (the ones made in America anyhow) are so full of computer generated effects that it's not clear what he's doing or what is a special effect.  This movie has none of that.  No CGI, no wires, no stunt doubles even!  Everything you see here was done by the actors without aid of computers or other tricks of the trade.  And that's what makes this movie all the more impressive.  When you see the stuff this guy does you will be blown away.

American movies have lost their appeal for me; they seem to either not show minority actors in real life-like roles are they show them in the same stereotypical roles.  I love this movie!",1148774400,,513,4.414893617021277
2324961,4,B0009VBTQY,"I've been eyeing this film ever since it discreetly came onto the DVD scene last August. I had heard about it online. I can't remember exactly where but I remember reading about the awesome action scenes and if you know me, I'm a sucker for big, awesome action scenes, particularly ones that involve intense moves being performed.

The plot to this movie is very very simple. When the head of a statue sacred to a village is stolen, a young martial artist goes to the big city and finds himself taking on the underworld to retrieve it. That's it. It's almost paper thin but it doesn't matter cause if you pick this movie up, you aren't doing so for a deep plot.

Tony Jaa is simply stunning in this movie. The moves he pulls off are awe-inspiring. They're wonderful to watch but there is something about them that takes them to the next level: they're real. That's right. EVERYTHING you see Jaa do in this movie he does for real. There's no stunt doubles, no CGI and no wires. It's 100% Jaa and boy, some of the moves he pulls off are astounding. He trained for four years for this movie and it shows big time. Jaa is an utter joy to watch. He's elegant, yes elegant, in his fluidity and the array of moves he pulls off. He uses his elbows, A LOT. You think Tom Cruise went elbow crazy at the end of M:I: III? In Ong-Bak Jaa goes nuts, and it's awesome.

The movie is in Thai but also has an English dubbing. Dubbing is evil so forget about that. The acting is solid for the most part. It's hard to say how they are exactly considering you can't tell how their delivery is, but their performances were solid. Each character was unique but not out there (ok, the voice box guy was different). Jaa though, has no charisma. When Jackie Chan or Jet Li are in a movie, they tell a story and are...well charismatic. Jaa's moves are amazing yes, but sometimes (rarely) they get repetitive, especailly towards the end. The music is funky at times but generic fare here. Nothing memorable or stand out. There's a lot of techno and hip-hop used throughout though and it isn't as distracting as you'd expect. This movie also has the best Thai three-wheeler chase I've ever seen. Probably cause it's the only Thai three-wheeler chase I've ever seen. It sounds extremely lame on paper, but its quite exciting to actually see.

As I said above, the action is top notch. But it isn't flawless. The faults in the action scenes are the director's fault though. He uses slow motion way too much and he shows almost everything Jaa does (and other things that happen) more than once. At least 2-3 times (sometimes more) for most ""events"", as we'll call them, that happen. Slow-Mo is a great technique to use in movie making, but while some things look cool slowed down, other things don't. There are plenty of scenes and moves that were slowed down in this movie that would have been better if they were kept at a normal speed. Jaa is fast and his elegance and fluidity should be shown at normal speed for some scenes. Some things turned out well with the aid of slow-mo but there were some scenes I would have liked at a normal speed. This sounds like a major gripe but it reallyt isn't. It doesn't hinder the movie severely or make it any less enjoyable, its just something that I as a viewer noticed.

There are also some genuinely funny moments, some are even unintentional but aren't what you're thinking. They aren't the ones that are so bad they're funny or ruin the movie. They're the rare unintentional funny moments that are good. One in particular is when you first see what Jaa can do in the boxing ring. When he does what he does I laughed to myself and said ""Ha-ha, that's awesome!"" It's those kind of moments, not moments of cheese.

I'm a sucker for a good action or martial arts movie. I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was not overly complex and was there enough to the point where I stayed interested, but never bored. Ong-Bak was a fun romp. The action was turned up to 12 and it was never boring. I definitely recommend a viewing if you like action/martial arts movies and/or just want to have a good time. It's not a ""second coming"" nor anything that will radically change your views about action movies. Its just a fun movie and nothing more, nothing less.",1148688000,,4263,4.458974358974359

2324965,2,B0009VBTQY,"""Ong Bak"" is a skimpily plotted film that serves as a testament to the incredible martial arts skills of Tony Jaa in the Muay Thai discipline.

The plot commences in a poor rural Thai village where a low level thug named Don played by an awfully dentated Wannakit Sirioput has come to purchase an ancient amulet at the behest of his boss.  When the owner refuses to sell, Don in frustration severs the head of the statue of Ong Bak, a prized good luck talisman of the village and steals it.  Fearing that bad fortune will befall the village they commission local guy Ting, played by the lithely athletic Jaa to reacquire the statue head.

Jaa proceeds to the sprawling streets of Bangkok where he has been advised to look up his cousin Humlae played by Petchtai Wongkamlao to help in his quest.  Humlae, once almost ordained as a monk, however has been corrupted by the Bangkok criminal underground turning into an inveterate gambler.  He finally agrees to help Jaa find Don leading him into a web of corruption including illegal no holds barred fights where millions of Thai baht is being bet.  This leads to a series of martial arts confrontations similar to some previously done Van Damme flicks.  The crime boss played by a grey haired gentleman with an artificial larynx sucks Jaa into combat using the statue head as ransom.

""Ong Bak"" really represents a series of wonderfully choreographed martial arts displays and chase scenes loosely woven together with a very meagre plot.",1142640000,5,1484,4.765625

Tony's air-kicks and elbo slams into people's heads and necks are simply jaw-dropping. The chase scene in the movie through the allyways and streets were absolutely amazing, with Tony Jaa flipping over sharp objects, almost flying gracefully over eye-popping leaps and bounds  --- as if he were half-man/half bird.

The best fight scenes are in this underground fighting club --- and I agree --- the fight between the big long hairy guy and MADDOG was simply priceless.

2324970,5,B0009VBTQY,"Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior bucks the trend of modern films featuring martial arts as an art form as much as a fighting style.  I happen to love films like House of the Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it's still a real treat to watch a martial arts film built on realistic moves and violence.  There's nothing artistic or beautiful about the action in this film; it's just direct, efficient, sometimes brutal violence intended to take a given opponent out as quickly as possible.  This particular style of fighting is significantly different than that of most films I've seen, featuring great use of the knees, elbow smashes that make Dusty Rhodes' old bionic elbow look practically harmless, and some incredibly aggressive jumps from a standing position that usually result in some seriously powerful blows.  It's really in-your-face stuff, and it's just terrific.  Tony Jaa is an amazingly fast, compactly devastating fighter with all manner of slick moves that make him as impressive in retreat as he is in the proverbial fighting ring.

The story itself isn't all that complicated.  Tony Jaa plays Ting, a student of the Muay Thai fighting style, who puts the fate of his small village on his own back after a thief steals the head of the local Ong-Bak statue.  Already suffering, the village believes that doom will fall upon it if the sacred head is not restored.  Once in Bangkok on the trail of the thief, Ting meets up with Hum Lae (Petchtai Wongkamlao), a former resident of the village who survives in the city by conning others out of their money.  Despite a written plea from Hum Lae's father, the con man is almost no help at all, only warming up to Ting when he discovers the guy is an incredible fighter.  Ting had been taught not to use his skills, but there was little choice if he were going to recover the villagers' money that Hum Lae stole from him.  Once he starts fighting, he can't really stop because all sorts of unsavory types are after him, including the guys he is after himself.  Indefatigable in his cause, Ting is more than willing to sacrifice his own life for that of his village, and he may have to pay that ultimate sacrifice as his pathway to the stolen head of Ong-Bak leads through increasingly dangerous men in great numbers.

While pretty basic, it's not a bad story at all - but clearly Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior is really all about the fighting.  You'll find no lack of action over the course of this film, each scene more intense than the last.  Ting isn't a superhero who just saves the day; he takes a pretty good beating over the course of his quest.  One unusual thing about this film is its proclivity to show slow-motion instant replays of much of the action.  This is a little disconcerting at first, then it becomes pretty cool, and then by the end it starts to become a little annoying.  Still, some of the moves are worth a second look, so I'm not going to quibble with the chosen style of directing.

Clearly, this is a film for martial arts fans.  If you don't enjoy movies featuring martial arts action and plenty of it, Ong-Bak will not win you over.  If you like a good fight, however, and want to see realism rather than wires and CGI pull it off, Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior is a breath of fresh air you will definitely want to check out.",1142121600,2,3319,4.580372250423012

2324975,4,B0009VBTQY,"First and foremost, and I am NOT a fan of most of the martial arts movies produced in the past 20 years. The main reason is they aren't really martial arts movies in the first place. I like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for its artistic merits only, not its SAD attempt at martial arts. Hiring actors who know NO martial arts and using wires to make them fly around onscreen will not get you a martial arts movie. A REAL martial arts movie has REAL martial artists in it who don't need to use wires to light up the screen (sorry Jet Li, you only ever made a couple of REAL martial arts movies, and they were made in Asia).

  Which brings me to Ong Bak. This is a REAL martial arts movie!! The things you see Tony Jaa doing onscreen are all ACTUALLY done by Jaa, with no wires or stunt doubles. This guy is AMAZING, and is EXACTLY what martial arts movies have been sorely lacking for the past few decades: real, talented martial artists!

  Just to let everyone know: the martial art style Jaa uses is called Muay Thai boxing, which is a legitimately VERY deadly style- many consider it the BEST overall martial art style in the world. One of the hallmarks of Thai boxing is the extensive use of elbow strikes, which Jaa demonstrates throughout Ong Bak.

  The story in Ong Bak is not much, but if you have watched any kung fu movies, you will know that the story is rarely developed much past the old 'seeking revenge for killing my master' routine. Ong Bak's story is different than that, but no more complex. It really doesn't matter that Ong Bak's storyline is simplistic, since ultimately it works thanks to Tony Jaa's charisma. I subtracted one star since the film editing is still a litle too MTV style (fast cuts during fight scenes) for my taste, although nowhere near as bad as in movies like Hero or Batman Returns. The movie also focuses a little too much on non-martial arts stunts and sequences (cab ride, anyone?) Still, all in all, Ong Bak is the MUST SEE martial art film of the past two decades.

  Tony Jaa does SO MANY amazing things, you may need to rewind several times to take it all in, but by all means, do so. Appreciating this man's skills is a big part of the fun that is Ong Bak.

  The real bottom line is if you like old-school kung fu films (no wires, REAL martial artists, good fight choreography) you will like Ong Bak. If Hero (Jet Li on wires through the whole movie) is more your style, you may want to look elsewhere, although I would still suggest you check out Ong Bak, since it represents what martial arts movies USED to be (and with guys like Tony Jaa around, could be again). If you liked Ong Bak and are searching for more GOOD martial arts movies, drop me an email. I would be happy to give my recommendations for more great old-school kung fu movies.",1141603200,,2799,4.376447876447877

It also makes some of those wire kung fu fights from Jet Li's stuff look lame. No wire supported stunt can match what the human body can do.

About this DVD/blu-ray. This is the French theatrical version. Luc Besson, a French film writer and producer that has done films for Jet Li, bought distributing rights for this film. He cut out a few scenes, gave the film some more powerful sound effects, and gave it a new hip-hop score during some of the action scenes (you can hear a ""yeah!"" and ""what up!?"" and ""rock the beat"" during these action scenes). If you want to see this film in its original version, buy the German blu-ray from Splendid. It has the original uncut Thai version in REMASTERED HD!",1139443200,,1002,4.566666666666666
2324980,5,B0009VBTQY,"I was half concentrating,going between different rooms/making cups of tea etc.and then i was transfixed by the first big fight scene....i'm not normally a fan of violence and it wasn't simply the utterly adorable main star (Tony Jaa)which caught my attention. Quite clearly the lack of technical paraphanalia/special effects adds a special dimension of visceral excitement. I hated Kung Fu Hustle but Ong-Bak is in an altogether different league.

However, i was left feeling dissappointed that i'd missed it on the big screen (DVDS are more like a momento/photo of a particular event than the real thing)so i shall keep my eyes out for future showings!",1138147200,,653,5.160377358490566
2324981,5,B0009VBTQY,"When first I heard of Ong-Bak I thought of movies like Bloodsport and Kickboxer, where the stories of these movies were permanently sidetracked for the action, and a lot of the action was so heavily coriagraphed that it failed and was given moments of slow motion to add drama to the scenes. And, in many ways, I don't think I was wrong to compare Ong-Bak in such a way. This movie, however, is the best of those two, but with something added that makes it one of those all-time best action films. What this movie had that other martial arts movies don't is pride. Let me explain.

The action in the Ong-Bak feels and look real. Though it's obviously coriagraphed to keep the long fight scenes from growing chaotic, the actors really take the blows that are coming their way. These actors bled to make this movie. From the start, when the warriors of a village are playing a game of capture the flag, which is at the top of the tree, you see just how hard these men were willing to work to make Ong-Bak a great film. They fell from the tree, bounced off branches, and slammed, hard, into the ground (which was padded with dirt). Later, during fight scenes, you see heads banging against walls and tables, feet connect squarely with chins, and bodies flying through walls. The realism of these scenes takes away the feeling of heavy choreography, and the fact alone that these men were so willing to take a beating earns this movie my respect.

The story is a simple yet effective one. A tiny village, devoted to Buddha and the statue representative of their god, Ong-Bak, is suffering from drought, and not only that but a thief has taken the head of Ong-Bak. Ting, the Thai Warrior, decides to use his skills as a fighter, something forbidden by his mentor, to try and find the head of Ong-Bak. He must travel to Bangkohk to do so, and once there he meets George, a man on permanent sojourn from his home village, and Muay, a part-time student and full-time hustler. With their help, Ting goes about his search, but during his search he finds himself embroiled in a gambling ring, and one he can only fight his way out of. Though it pains him to have to fight, he'll do anything to save the head of Ong-Bak.

The sheer amount of action in this movie makes it great. Just as you're getting your breath back from the last scene, here comes the next. Most of the fights just start, with very little emotional build up to try to add some generic drama to the scene, and once they start, they last for a long time. Though 20th Century Fox could have done a better job with the subtitles, it doesn't take away from the movie. I recommend this movie highly to anyone who loves action flicks and are tired of the generic American fight films that are coming out today.",1138060800,,2761,4.452569169960475
2324982,5,B0009VBTQY,"Just watched ONG BAK! (aka Thai Warrior) Starring Tony Jaa as a simple country boy who leaves his village on a quest to the  big city where he must hunt down the evil drug lord who stole the head of his village' s sacred Buddha statue.

The impressive thing about this movie is that the blazingly brutal yet lighter than air martial arts action is all done without the benefit of wires or CG.  That fact probably does not mean much until you actually see how Tony Jaa essentially walks on air to escape or defeat his foes.

Jaa trained in the ancient form of Muay Boran for four years in preparation for this film. Muay Boran is a predecessor to Muay Thai (Thai Boxing) that focuses on powerful Elbow and Knee strikes designed to be efficient and deadly. It is not a tournament sport learned for entertainment.  In this way, Jaa seems to follow in the footsteps of legendary Bruce Lee by primarily using moves that are based on real fighting techniques in order to bring innovation to the genre.

Of course, in the interest of entertainment, the moves and fights are all highly stylized, choreographed, edited and played out to enhance the excitement to an unreal level.  But one thing is clear though, these guys are taking these hits for real. When Jaa plants a knee into someone's face, that someone is really getting smacked in the face. Wurd. Though I am sure the kicks and punches are being pulled, they are making solid contact... no camera angle tricks here. Many of these shots are played out repeatedly from different angles in slow-mo just to underscore that fact.

A welcome added ingredient to this film, are a couple of awesome Jackie Chan-esque chase scenes in which Jaa seemingly defies gravity in ways that would make Spider-Man jealous!

Unfortunately, Jaa's Character, Ting, lacks the charisma and personality that make Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and even Spider-Man much easier to empathize with and root for. The script is probably to blame for that though. The story plays out as clich and predictable as any Steven Seagall actioner. But we all know that story is a secondary element in this genre. Jaa's skills are so impressive that he carries this film all the way through, so overall it's pretty entertaining stuff and I guarantee you will make shouts of thrilled astonishment at some of the stunts and fight scenes. I shouted, ""OH JEEZE THAT""S GOTTA HURT!""",1137628800,,2379,4.713253012048193
2324983,5,B0009VBTQY,"Ong Bak is beyond any action or fighting film you'll see this year. Tony Jaa gives you some of the most death defying, bone crushing, just plain old sick and wild stunts and martial arts you can handle. The film starts out a little quiet and then your thrown into a scene where Tony quickly defeats an opponent with one strike. Tony doesn't want to fight because his technique is just that deadly but he is forced to because the head of his village's sacred statue has been stolen. He leaves for the city to find the son of a village resident because he knows the city and can make the search for the thief end faster.

Jaa only runs into more and more trouble because he is so hard to defeat and of course people want to fight the guy that can't be beaten. Time is running out as his village is suffering without the head, there is a drought and the water wale is running dry and food is short. Will he get the sacred head back in time? You truly watch Ong Bak for the incredible fighting and stunts that are just out of this world. Every review is basically going to say the same thing and that's Tony Jaa is this entire movie and keeps it that way to the very end. I recommend you watch this with subtitles because it's way better than the horrible voice over actors.",1137456000,,1270,4.226337448559671

2324985,5,B0009VBTQY,"From Smother Magazine - smother.net:

One of the most devastating martial arts is Muay Thai boxing. The movie is centered around a young villager who is urged to retrieve a stolen Buddhist icon named Ting played efficiently by Tony Jaa. Jaa trained for four years for his role in Ong-Bak by studying the ancient form of Muay Boran, which was the predecessor to today's version of Muay Thai. Without the benefit of stunt doubles or special effects, let alone the invisible strings that were employed in fantastical martial arts movies like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", Jaa flies about the screen and shows off his impressive skills. The plot while somewhat predictably martial arts-esque keeps you interested as you grow vested into the characters. The fight sequences are among some of the most amazing that I've ever seen. Along the way we also get to enjoy the humorous asides that make this movie one of 2003's best martial arts films.",1135987200,,943,4.930817610062893

I just bought this dvd not even thinking they might re-edit it from the theater release and now I'm not sure if the bootleg I watched was the foreign cut or the US theater release cuz I never seen it in theaters so I wouldnt know. But I know that the little edits they did make on this dvd and certain scenes that were cut out and the fact I pretty much watched the better version enough times to notice the difference makes this dvd version WACK as hell. It had a whole different feel to the film overall. It is minor changes they made but they made a big difference. If this version were the one I'd seen first I wouldnt have wanted to buy it. Does anybody know the regular version I'm talking about and know where I can buy that? One little change to help you folks to know what version I'm talking about in case you have info on where to get it. In the first cut of this movie I watched,when Ting first gets to the city he meets his cousin ""Dirty Ballz"" and that was a funny scene but in this dvd version he only calls him ""Humlae"" and just killed the mood of that scene. So if yall know where to get the version I'm lookin for please reply. This movie isn't bad,just this version of it. Other than that this movie is the sh*t.",1135036800,3,1498,4.043771043771044
2324987,4,B0009VBTQY,"In ONG BAK, Tony Jaa is Ting, at first seen to be a quiet and kindly young Thai man living in a peaceful rural Thai village that has as a moral center a large statue of Buddha.  The film begins in a most puzzling manner. Dozens of Thai men surround a very large tree and simply stare at it.  I had no idea what was to happen.  At a signal, they climg the tree, all of whom seek to capture a flag at the pinnacle.  All clamber like monkeys, but it is Ting who succeeds.  What is astounding is that no special effects or wires are used to allow the actors to ""fly"" through the air as in ""Crouching Tiger"" fame. When an actor falls to the ground, he truly falls with bone-thudding results. Although it was not apparent to me at the time, this scene had two purposes. First, the director made it clear that this was no film of special effects. The actors lived or died on athletic ability. Second, the quest for the flag soon morphed in a quest for the head of the village's Buddha that is stolen by a local thug.  It is Ting's quest to recover this head in Bangkok that forms the bulk of the film.

The action of the film is kinetic.  One scene after another allows Ting to show off his considerable Muay Thai fighting skills.  Tony Jaa as Ting reminds me of a young Bruce Lee, both of whom play polite young men surrounded by brute thugs.  In each case, both Jaa had Lee had to retain their inner core of morality and peace.  Lee's fluid style of Jeet Kune Do stands in marked contrast to the more straight line method of elbow smashes and slow motion forward kicks.  The plot is basic and simple.  Ting has to enter a number of cage fights in which he dispatches a number of varied opponents, ranging from Australian pit fighters to Bruce Lee type razzle-dazzle kung fu artists. Yet, it is not just these fights that capture the eye and ear. Rather, Tony Jaa displays an unreal sense of agility and speed that allows him to dive in and out of obstacles that daunt his pursuers.  When confronted by a dozen thugs that Bruce Lee might have dispatched by kicks, Jaa, incredibly, leaps and walks out of danger on their heads, in a manner that Paul Hogan did in the closing scene of CROCODILE DUNDEE.  When these same thugs box him in a narrow alley, Jaa dives over, around, and through a series of obstacles that leave the viewer gasping.  No stunt doubles or wires were used in any of these scenes.  What becomes clear by the closing reel is that Jaa is meant to be seen as a symbol of the uncorruptibility of the spirit as symbolized by the stolen head of Buddha.  Ironically, the spirit of peace that the hoods thought could be purchased by the sale of that head was in reality always there for the asking.  But to achieve that peace, they first had to have a clear mind.  They did not and that is why ONG BAK is more of a paen to the virtues of the simple life than it is a call to the wonders of bone crunching Muay Thai fighting techniques.",1134172800,2,2941,4.2459605026929985

2324990,5,B0009VBTQY,"There is not one single reason to pick up this film - not for the story, the acting, or the soundtrack.  It is what it is:  a clichd story and bad acting all around filling in between a series of elaborately crafted fight scenes and chase sequences.  I won't even bother with a plot description here...trust me, you just won't care.

 But oh, those magnificent fights!!!

I am so in awe.  Tony Jaa is a supremely talented martial artist, and anybody that has anything more than a white belt will instantly recognize just how talented this guy has to be in order to pull off even half of what he does in Ong-Bak the Thai Warrior.  There's no sense in trying to describe him in motion with words, any more than the essence of a lightning storm could be captured in granite.

So, grab your remote and fast forward through the obligatory ""plot"" parts if you are short on patience and hungry for the action.  I count about 5 good extended action scenes altogether, which IMHO is not a bad return on investment.

If karate, kung fu, muay thai or *whatever* martial arts movies are your bag, then this is your film. Just see it (if only the once) to see who's giving Jackie Chan and Jet Li a run for their money.

2324991,4,B0009VBTQY,"btw, just saw ""Ong Bak: Thai Warrior"" tonight, first heard of this film through a martial arts forum I used to participate in.

WOW, this new guy Tony Jaa is a real physical genius...maybe he really is the next Bruce Lee, his stunts are amazing and zero wires, safety nets, or computer enhancement.  In the ""special features behind-the-scenes"" clip there's one scene where you see that he literally sets himself on fire without wearing any protective clothing...nuts!

It was nice to see all the Muay Thai kickboxing moves (elbows and knees) for a change, though he does sell out and throw in some totally unrealistic Hollywood-kwon-do jump-spinning kicks to pretty it up some.  I have trained in Muay Thai myself and can say that about 50% of the techniques he does in the fight scene are actually authentic and street-practical; lest you scoff, 50% is a staggeringly high percentage in this kind of movie!

Well, THIS is definitely not a movie you watch for the acting or dialogue, shall we say.  There are parts which are just BAD and amateurish from a film-craft perspective, but you quickly overlook them as soon as the next round of chop-socky comes up.

Fun and funny though, even if a lot of the ""funny"" was unintentional (i.e. clumsy acting, cheesy soundtrack, etc.), but very fun.  The violence is cartoonish really, Tony Jaa never seems to actually KILL anyone, just incapacitate them, and his character (a Buddhist monk in training no less, LOL!) never shows any real viciousness or bloothirsty enjoyment.

Tony Jaa really EMBARASSES the heck out of Stallone, Arnie, Vin Diesel, Seagall, Van Damme, and all of those other Hollywood posers.  Only Jackie Chan and *maybe* Jet Li come close, LOL it would be fun to have Jaa and one of them go at it.

I have traveled America competing in free-style sparring, and at no point during my travels did I see anyone with the ability of Tony Jaa.  This guy is a walking ball of fire!  And in the movie, he even proves that by kickin' tail while he is literally on fire.

This is the type of movie martial artists love to watch.  It is as close as one can get to watching an actual documentary of a martial arts student trying out his techniques in real life fighting techniques on real people.  The stunts are amazing, every fight scene is worth watching twice!

2324999,4,B0009VBTQY,"In the grand tradition of Return of the Dragon, The Transporter, and pretty much anything with Jet Li in it, Ong-Bak is a grand martial-arts spectacle, with thin shards of plot holding together a lightning-paced succession of dizzying stunts and fight scenes.  As a movie it works reasonably well; as an action movie it works considerably better; as a showcase for the talents of star Tony Jaa it succeeds brilliantly.  Much has been made of the lack of wires, special effects, and stunt doubles in this movie, and rightly so: the ample violence in Ong-Bak is exceedingly blunt in its brutality, with Jaa unleashing his knees, elbows, feet, and fists on a seemingly endless series of enemies.  The fight scenes here have an immediacy that's sorely lacking in modern-day CGI spectacles; while it's rare for me to wince at cinematic fight scenes these days, I found myself doing so several times while watching this one.  The plot isn't exactly anything too tough to get your head around-virtuous villager Ting ventures to Bangkok to retrieve a statue head stolen by a big-city thief, and quickly finds himself forced to use his Muay Thai mastery to achieve his goal-but as a pretext for some clobbering it works just fine.  There's a great deal of both quality and quantity here, as action scenes are never far apart and frequently riveting.  Early on we get a display of Ting jumping through and over pretty much anything you can think of-food stations, a barbed-wire wreath, numerous other people-but it's in the fight scenes that Ong-Bak more than provides its money's worth.  In one completely gratuitous but compulsively watchable sequence, Ting works his way through three toughs in a street-fighting arena, culminating with a guy named Mad Dog who's not above using tables, chairs, pottery, and electricity to win a fight.  Naturally things get progressively tougher for Ting as the plot wears on and he moves higher up the criminal food chain, but hey, no one ever said doing the right thing was easy, even when you can combine stunning power with an apparent ability to defy the laws of gravity that restrain us ordinary men. By the time Ting gets to the final showdown against a wheelchair-bound, throatless overlord and his uber-tough Burmese bodyguard, he's been battered in pretty much every manner possible, but no matter.  If this movie has a moral, it's that those who desecrate the Buddha must die, and apparently in jaw-dropping fashion as well.

I saw this movie as part of an Asian Film Festival at my university. The only prior knowledge I had of this film was that it was from Thailand and that the actors perform all of their stunts without stunt doubles or special effects. Whoop-dee-do, the concept of 'doing one's own stunts' wasn't a completely foreign idea to me (remember Jackie Chan). However, if I didn't know this to be true after watching the movie, I would have thought you were lying to me. The stunts in this movie are incredible!!!

I never thought this movie would be released on DVD in America because it isn't a widely known movie, and doesn't have a big name star. I'm so excited that it is! I was trying to explain to my friends the uniqueness and intrigue of Tony Jaa's style of fighting, but they were too caught up in the mainstream admiration of Jackie Chan and Jet Li (not to say that they aren't great, but they have Hollywood to back them up). Anyway, now I'm glad I can show them Jaa's fantastic talent first hand. I'm sure they're going to want to add this to their movie collections.",1128470400,,1190,4.3558558558558556

And whats up with the dvd cover on the back it has a refrence to this guy's move's would put Jackie Chan to a chaoprator yeh right Jackie could do this movie's intire stunts and fight scenes in 1 day. About the dvd its awful it forces you to read closed captions if you wacth the movie in its original language,how does that get by the people who make this dvd. I understand the need for HEARING IMPAIRED tracks but don't make it mandatory for all.

2325010,2,B0009VBTQY,"The general consensus seems to be that Tony Jaa is the next Jackie Chan.  I flat out disagree.  At the very least, Tony Jaa lacks the cinematic charm and appeal of Jackie Chan, and at worst he lacks the martial arts abilities.

This film had no plot or story, the script may as well have been ad-libbed, and the acting was horrific.  But that apparently doesn't mean much because Tony Jaa is capable of ""tricking"".  I've seen him perform, and I think he'd get his [...] kicked in a real Muay Thai fight; his background is TKD spattered with enough MT to make him look somewhat beliveable.  Otherwise, all he does are tricks.  And they're not even very good tricks.  FLashy kicks and spins which will appeal to a non-martial artist while the real martial artists just shake their heads and giggle uncontrollably at the stupidity of what he thinks is good for fighting.

This rates as the 2nd best martial arts film of all time (1st being ""Enter the Dragon"") in my book. Tony Jaa is destined for a great future in company with the likes of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, etc... He is simply incredible throughout the film. Not much dialogue but he delivers some of the best action sequences I've ever seen on film.

2325015,4,B0009VBTQY,"ONG BAK is one of the best if not the best martial arts films i've seen. If you notice in other martial arts films (not all) they use strings to have the actor fly across the scene when he gets punched in the chest. In this movie, they actually hit the person unless its a punch or knee to the face. This new comer Tony Jaa is amazing which can do stunts and acrobatic leaps out of no where. I've seen a video of a live performance and backflips like he was just simply walking.

One thing i didn't like about this movie is the story line. Oh my god the story was so..... boring at times. The racing scene was not needed or not needed to be so long. All Tony Jaa or Ting in the movie said was ""where is ong bak"", ""help me find ong bak"", or ""hey, you have ong bak, you're going to die"".

One thing why so many people like this movie is because of his fighting style which is called muay thai. Not many movies have shown muay thai to the fullest like Ong Bak. One reason this movie's fight scenes look so repetetive is because muay thai only has a couple moves. I think they pulled it off very well. A very bad thing this movie did was show a stunt in multiple views. It was annoying. And the slow motion shots of him hitting some of the guys was done wrong. You can tell that he is actually hitting the stunt man but also can see how they are ready to get hit.

This is a great movie and very entertaining ONLY IF YOU LOVE FIGHT SCENES! the story is not even a B story, it is like C. You should buy it. This is only his first movie and look how popular it is.

His second movie is called TOM YUM GOONG. It is already out in Thailand. go to tomyumgoongmovie.com",1126569600,2,1659,4.003021148036254
2325016,5,B0009VBTQY,"just rented this movie today, and I loved this movie. Jaa has some great skills in his style of fighting. Great to see someone to do all these moves and not be some stupid slang talking wannabe action star, this guy is the real deal. Ofcourse parts of the story are kinda wierd, but for me the action made up for it. And ofcourse if you read other reviews the few things that were shown three times in a row, didn't mind the sliding under the vehicle angles though. Does set good morals, the bad deserve to feel the pain they give to others in the end, and it takes someone with disipline in life and understanding to get rid of them. I myself liked when he beat the guy who looked like some kind of rodey for a heavy metal band, all them muscles couldn't

stop Jaas character. Some good humor in the movie too, some drama , mostly near the end. If you want to see a real newcommer show you some moves get Ong Bak, don't let the story take you down a little, if you even notice the story through the action.",1126483200,4,1007,4.137755102040816
2325025,2,B0009VBTQY,"I don't care that the Thai Warrior does his own stunts.  I don't care if he doesn't use wires.  All I wanted were well-choreographed fight scenes.  Sure, the Thai Warrior is a very agile stuntman, but the choreography looks like a 2 year old was in charge.  The Thai Warrior does the same moves over and over again - and he always ends each fight with that flying elbow attack.  That move looks boring, and worse, any competent fighter worth his while could probably think of at least 2,000 ways to counter that lame-looking move.

At one in the movie, we're treated to a chase scene that DRAGS and DRAGS FOREVER and EVER.  It seemed like 5-10 minutes of seeing the Thai Warrior jumping in the air and doing splits over various obstacles.  Congratulations to the actor for his agility, but unfortunately for us, it's not very entertaining to watch after the first 2-3 jumps.  If I wanted to see someone jumping through hoops, I'd go to the circus.

Sure, this guy's acrobatic, but the fight scenes are far BELOW par.  If you want to see good fight scenes, go check out a Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan or Jet Li movie.  But if you want to see a 90 minute audition tape for the circus, go watch ""Ong-Bak.""",1126310400,6,1196,4.435779816513762
2325026,4,B0009VBTQY,"Sometime about a year ago my roommates and I were watching this clip on the television over and over again. It detailed a fighter who was doing a bunch of kung-fu-y spinny moves, then advances towards an opponent who...

Roommate: ""He stepped on his face.""

Me: ""Wow. It's like a kick, only--""

Roommate: ""Only he stepped on his face.""

Me: ""How's that possible?""

Roommate: ""I don't know...""

The opponent is Tony Jaa, the star of this film.

In a small, farming village, a young man named Ting is training to be ordained by the monk of the village until a local of the village, who had moved to the city and was visiting, steals the head of the Ong-Bak, the village Buddha. Considering the village's drought and other bad luck, this last problem leaves them with no chance, so Ting embarks out to the big city to recover the treasure.

Once there, he meets up with another from the village, Hum Lae, who has gotten in trouble with some local thugs. Hum Lae promises to help Ting, but only after they deal with Hum Lae's debt and the mysterious shady man who hides behind a glass wall and has his hand on some artifacts.

As kung fu movies go, this one is a stunning example. In a world currently dazzled with wire-fu and long, invested imagery of colors, this one is much more simplistic and as a result, dirtier. Tony Jaa's martial arts are great not because he can spin around seven million times in a second, but because his moves are relatively simple and pack quite a punch. Nearly every hit in this movie looks like it hurts, and the action only gets more and more violent.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that the action scenes are very cleverly built into the script, they're also a bit too long... not because they're never ending, but because the director felt the need to show every important move two or three times over again. Sometimes an action is finished, such as Ting splitting a biker's helmet with an elbow, and then it's shown again, and then again, all in slow motion. It really adds nothing to the movie and gets annoying and tedious.

Still, the tagline of this movie, ""No stunt doubles, no computer images, no strings attached"" definitely helps explain why most of the action in this film looks like it hurts. Together with a really involving story line, it's a film that's definitely worth the watch.

First i'll start off with what's good about this movie, and that is the amazing fighting skills of Tony Jaa.  Unfortunately, the guy couldn't act if his life depended on it.  The story is flimsy, and the movie would have been more interesting if they had just abandoned the plot altogether.  I mean, Tony Jaa's character is supposed to be a buddhist monk?  He has very little virtue, and comes off more stubborn than anything.  Why does it take him so long to rescue the guy fighting in the ring, and why doesn't the guy care about the girl lying there in the apartment about to die of an overdose.  And another thing, the directing was horrible.  I don't need to see every fighting move replayed 3 times in slow motion to see what the guy did.  And then there was that terribly long chase scene right in the middle that I had to fast-forward through.  This doen't compare to the work that Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan have done.  Oh yeah, and even at his age, Jackie Chan could still kick the shi# out of this newcomer.

2325034,5,B0009VBTQY,"""Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior"" combines old school filmmaking techniques and really old school martial arts.  The tagline for this film gleefully announces: ""No stunt doubles. No computer graphics. No stings attached.""  Yes, they are doing astounding and beautiful things with wire work in movies like ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and there would be no ""Lord of the Rings"" without massive amounts of CGI, but there is something to be said for watching a young man race through along the large branches of a giant tree or doing all of the things that Tony Jaa does in this 2003 film from Thailand and director Prachya Pinkaew that has finally come out on DVD here (being a stunt man is a honorable professional, that should be recognized by the Academy Awards, but the fact that some movies use stunt men is taken for granted in contemporary film making).

To be clear, Ong-Bak is not the name of the Thai Warrior.  Ong-Bak is the name of the Buddha in the Thai village where Ting (Jaa), the Thai Warrior, lives.  At the start of the film Ting has been taught all there is to know about the Muay Thai martial arts, after which his teacher kindly asks him never to use them to fight.  But then a bad guy named Don (Wannakit Siriput), unable to swindle a local out of a cultural artifact, makes his anger known by chopping off and stealing the head of Ong-Bak.  Ting is sent to fetch it back, and since he is willing to die to bring back the Buddha's head, using his Muay Thai skills is hardly going to be a problem.

When he arrives in Bangkok he finds Humlae/(Petchthai Wongkamlao), who left the simple life of the village long ago to become a petty criminal named George in the big bad city.  Ting brings Humlae a letter from his father, and we get the idea that there is more to George than being the comic relief sidekick for the Thai Warrior.  George has his own sidekick with Muay Lek (Punwaree Yodkamol), a young woman who says as much in any given scene as escapes Ting's lips in the entire movie.  Getting Humlae to help find Don and therefore find Ong-Bak's head becomes Ting's immediate hurdle, and leads Ting to a local fight club where he shows what a Muay Thai master can do against all comers.  There we meet the real bad guy of the film, the local Godfather Khom Tuan (Sukhaaw Phongwilai), who makes smokes through the hole in his throat and holds up an electronic device to make himself heard.  He keeps making the mistake of betting against Ting, and he does not take his loses lightly.

For most of the film the narrative simply seems like a reason not to have wall-to-wall action sequences, which are certainly the high points of the film.  What makes the fighting look different is the really old school martial arts of Muay Thai, which thinks that driving you thigh or your forearm through the head of your opponent is a good thing.  The comparisons to Bruce Lee has to do not so much with the particular fighting style but the fact Jaa is out there doing this all on his own.  But Jaa is also like Jackie Chan in that he does acrobatic stunts that have nothing to do with fighting.  The first time when we see Ting and he is racing along the branches of the tree is as impressive as anything else in the film, although the boxing choreography does stand out the most.

The photography of the film is decidedly dark, as if every interior and night scene was lit by candles (maybe they were), but you get used to that after a while.  The action sequences are immensely entertaining, which is what you want in a martial arts film, regardless of how they do the stunts.  Still, knowing that Jaa is just out there doing all of this stuff on his own is a large part of the fun and even if you consume martial arts films in mass quantities, this one should still be unlike anything you have seen before (it obviously was for me).  However, I ended up rounding up on this one in the end because I liked the way the film did not back off from the resolution of the Humlae subplot.  Plus the graphic way the film indicates it is not good to cut the head off of a Buddha.",1125619200,3,4076,4.3981358189081226

The plot was cheesy, the acting was worse, the fighting was slick but got tired of the 3 angle instant replays everytime something even remotely cool happened.

This movie is best watch with a group of friends, a few cases of beer, and ad-libing in your own lines as our hero does one after another flying elbow or knee to the neck of his opponents.  It's just like playing Tekin but without the button mashing.",1125619200,2,607,4.2894736842105265
2325036,5,B0009VBTQY,"I saw this movie recently at the Acadamy Theater in Pasadena, California. I was feeling a little under the weather. There were about 20 other somber people in the theater, including my five year-old daughter who I brought with me despite my concerns about the R rating.

Suffice it to say that about thirty minutes into the movie the entire audience was visibly activated and energized by this stone-cold classic-for-eternity. My health had suddenly returned, I was pumped up on massive doses of epinephrine. Folks, this movie succeeeds on every level. I'm not a huge martial arts expert like many of the reviewers, but I was a kid in the late 60's when Bruce Lee (and Jimi Hendrix) ruled the world, and rightly so. This is the only fighting movie which I've seen since which even comes close to one of the better Bruce Lee movies. I will even contend, with some reservation, that it surpasses the Bruce Lee classics: there is humour, dramatic and sophisticated tuk-tuk chase scenes, foot-chase scenes, splendidly convincing archeological sights, and obviously, absolutely SAVAGE multiple fight scenes where good defeats evil with satisfying Dirty Harry righteousness. The fight scenes in this movie are certified artistic masterpieces and deserve their own special place at the Smithsonian. And, even the soundtrack is good, with a pulsating techno-style music that really builds the tension. This movie delivers the goods.

Having been to Thailand several times and loving that country, I was very happy that this movie pays such a fitting tribute to their culture, the Thai kickboxing sport as well as the gentle and happy demeanor of the Thai people.

I should mention that by the end of the movie I had nothing but pleasure in having had my daughter watch the movie and share this unique experience. Goodness prevails over evil. Bad guys die a deserved death. Disciplined boy saves his village through courage, honor, persistence and skill. Wayward soul (Ting's cousin who has gambling debts and other character...flaws) is reminded of his roots through observing the integrity of his friend, and he finds spiritual redemption through his efforts at becoming a good guy once again. Boy returns to village having honored his family and completed the mission...I'm afraid Sesame Street could not teach a better lesson about life and its struggles.

This movie will almost certainly become more famous as time goes on and people outside of the martial arts community learn about it. I left the theater stunned and enthralled. Just awesome.",1125532800,89,2541,5.086330935251799

As far as I can tell, there is only a closed caption ""dubtitle"" track rather than a true subtitle track.  Personally, I can stand these kind of tracks with their ""audience shouting""  and ""man shouting"".  If there was a normal subtitle track I would give it atleast a 4.

2325038,4,B0009VBTQY,"I wavered between 3 and 4 stars on this film, but the caliber of the fight scenes almost pushes this movie to 5 stars.  It is no joke that Tony Jaa could be the next Bruce Lee/Gordon Liu, etc.... (whatever martial arts action star you think is great).  The end fighting scenes were so good that the movie would have been better if they simply cut out the rest.

Therein lies my only issue with this movie; if you have some great martial arts why not weave it together with a better story line.  Although not outright anti-Western, there are some troubling portrails of Westerners in this film.  Believe me, I am not naive and realize what goes on in Thailand (I have been there several times) and there is definitely some cultural significance to the movie's underlying theme... but it hurts the film more than it helps.  The movie then takes several predictable turns and emulates a Western style shoot 'em up, blow 'em up style.  I just hope the next movie involves more of Tony Jaa's talents rather than needless pyrotechnics. I just wanted the buyer to be aware of the rest of the movie (not that it matters that much) since the rest of the reviews focus (quite rightly) on the fighting.

While the acting wasn't top notch, it wasn't all that bad and doesn't kill the movie.

In conclusion, while the storyline is contrived and the plot a bit sophmoric, Tony Jaa is no joke and I am searching for more of his movies as I type.  All action and martial arts fans will be blown away by his ability and presence.",1125446400,,1512,4.445652173913044

Such is the effect of this groundbreaking introduction of hopefully a new wave of martial arts films, which raises the bar for energy, impact, marvel, and physical triumph.  Anyone who is curious about what the human body is capable of (in Jaa's case, it seems limitless) will enjoy this.

2325043,2,B0009VBTQY,"Being a great fan of martial arts movie, I recently watched two martial arts movies from countries other than China and Japan, which where most of the films of that genre come from. The first was ""Arahan"", a spectacular Matrix-style movie that pays homage to everything from Bruce Lee (the main kids hairstyle) and Kill Bill (the main heroines outfit) to the Karate Kid (bumbling loser to respectable fighter under a sensei) and Spider Man (in character development), from South Korean and the more grounded ""Ong-Bak"" from Thailand.

Ong-Bak has a very simple story that would not be out of place in one of those Jean Claude Van Damme movies of the mid-80's. A fighter who plans to become a monk is sent to Bangkok to recover the head of the village Buddha before an important Buddhist ceremony. He is asked to seek out a fellow villager who has become a low level street thug and also teams up with a girl who seems to be in high school or college.

The main character is not a person, but the acrobatics and Muay Thai boxing that make up a large chunk of the movie. As an actor, Tony Jaa is very weak. He is not hardened, he has a soft voice and he is as wooden as he walks. However, for the role of a mere monk, I guess he was well cast. What he does well is jump and fight. Watching American Muay Thai fighting movies (mostly B- movies) it would seem that type of kickboxing is slow and boring, but Jaa brings life into his sweeping kicks and elbows to the head. I was actually at the edge of my seat during his fight in the circle. I'll never say that Muay Thai is ever dull again.

However, the fighting is not supported by strong characterizations. You feel nothing for Jaa or his quest, mainly because it becomes secondary to him kicking some butte. His fellow villager actually gains more sympathy (at the end of the movie) as does the female lead, who's is the most annoying young sidekick I have seen in a long time (displacing Shia LeBeauf in his annoying turns in ""I Robot"" and ""Constantine""). She has a grating high pitched voice and you want her to constantly go away and groan when she always re-appears on screen.

The direction is good and the director captures the action well. However, the movie is more of a throwback to the older Jackie Chan flicks of the 1980's. Jaa seems to have taken to the critics labeling Chan the Chinese ""Buster Keaton"" because he does his own version of running down back alleys from the baddies, avoiding fragile items, leaping over obviously placed obstacles and using everything that is around him as a weapon (but mostly his feet).

So compared to ""Arahan"" and it's high flying special effects, chemistry between the leads and very funny humor interjecting with manga type mysticism, Ong-Bak is a disappointment because the only thing it has is Jaa's awesome kicks and punches. However, when you realize that there were no stunt men, no wires and no CGI, his martial arts are something to behold. It's too bad that the movie and acting sucked and the directing was just average....Rating: C-",1120694400,7,3043,4.545620437956204
2325044,5,B0009VBTQY,"I don't know how many times I thought that watching this unbelievable movie, but it was alot. Tony Jaa can do things that are hard to comprehend at first, thus they've provided replays with multiple angles for the truly insane stunts. I KNOW people got hit, and hit hard several times in this movie, either with knees, elbows, staffs etc. They aint playing around in the fights here by any stretch. Ting (Jaa's charactor)is an a$$-kicker of the first degree, even making Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan look tame by comparisson. I hope to see Tony Jaa in many more films. Doing a 1080 degree jumping kick to the face with your legs on FIRE...just nuts...10 stars!",1120003200,,657,4.6239316239316235
2325045,4,B0009VBTQY,"Overseas DVD version:  Out of Thailand comes this spectacular Muay Thai martial arts film. You'll read reviews where the story is rated as medicore, but go into it with that idea and you'll find the story is a little more above par than expected. It's short, so there isn't quite the designated length to develop characters.

Ong Bak does provide a mixture of credible acting to some less fortunate talent. However, this doesn't hamper the experience at all. Ting (Tony Jaa) goes into the city to track down the village's item that was stolen. In the meantime, he is to give a letter to a former villager from his father and recruit him in the quest. This is where he meets the off-beaten partner and also a girl who is being raised by her older sister. Unfortunately, the older sister is not someone to look up too, and I'll let you experience that on your own.

Here is where I'll sound like a broken record; This movie has some of the best martial art scenes ever to grace the screen. Tony Jaa does his own stunts, no wires, and is very entertaining to watch. There are some jaw-dropping kicks, flips, and bone-crushing chops. HOW PAINFUL IT WOULD BE TO BE ON THE RECEIVING END! It is hard to believe this is Tony's first major role. There is even a Thailand ""Western Movie Style"" taxi chase scene to add to the enjoyment.

I watched this with 5 other people, two of which had to be coaxed to watch it due to it being subtitled and having martial arts. Well, they both asked to borrow it right afterwards. One even called his brother to brag about it 2 minutes after it was done. I'm sounding like I am hyping this up, but it speaks for itself. In the beginning, it seems like it could be a Walt-Disney movie, but almost 1/2 way through it changes tempo.

I am so glad I came upon this movie and read the reviews. People were not joking about the incredible stunts and fight scenes. Different!

Parents beware: The subtitles still do submit a good amount of bad language. I haven't seen the version that was released in the States, but I heard it was cut...and I hopefully it wasn't dubbed.",1119744000,2,2093,4.4375
2325046,4,B0009VBTQY,"Oh Mi God, Oh Mi God, Oh Mi God...

What a shock to the jaded system!

I went into the cinema and sat in an empty auditorium. The place was deserted and I had a damn private screening of this martial arts film from Thailand. To say that it blew me away is an understatement.

There isn't a single CGI shot, no ropes, everything artificial was cast away and what we're left with is an almost documentary realism in the bone-crunching fight scenes. The Muay-Thai fighting style is brought to brutal life in some of the most convincing fight choreography in the history of motion pictures. Forget Bruce Lee and clowns like Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme or even the wire-foo antics of Jet Lee. Tony Jaa brings athletic magnetism and fire to his role as a villager sent out into the big city to restore the missing head of a Buddha statue which was stolen by a gangster.

I absolutely guarantee you that you'll leave the cinema with your jaw stuck to the floor.

Magnificent joy this, old fashioned entertainment filled with screen magic, it's what the cinema was invented for.

What a breath of fresh air this film is! Roll on the DVD...

2325047,5,B0009VBTQY,"It is one the the best martial arts movies I have ever seen. the acting is not that great, becasue the movie is mostly concentrating on Tony Jaa beating the crap out of people. A lot of fancy acrobatic tricks. The were no stunt doubles used, as well as all the ticks were done without any help or CGI. I would suggest it to all the martial arts fans, you will ove this one.

This release has had about 7 minutes cut from the film.  If you are a martial arts fan then you will most certainly be awestruck by either version, so happy viewing.",1118966400,5,340,4.365079365079365
2325049,5,B0009VBTQY,"You can get the synopsis of Ong-Bak from any of the other reviews, so I thought I would just say this.  I have seen dozens upon dozens of martial arts films, and just like anything else, the more exposure you get, the more things tend to just run together.  From the opening tree climbing sequence, I knew this film would stand out from the crowd - and the rest of this jaw-dropping movie merely confirmed my suspicion.  If you like this sort of thing, go see it.  You will not regret it, and if you're like me, you will remember every detail about the experience.  What day it was, the theater where you saw it, etc. - it's that striking.",1110412800,2,639,4.291666666666667
2325050,5,B0009VBTQY,"I just got back from seeing this - I've heard that the plot for this movie was thin  - but I think it was great. It was enough to allow the character's true character (or lack there of) to shine though -  and I think that some of the subtly may have been lost on the American movie goer. I'm glad they kept the sub-titles.

But, this was an ACTION film, and an outstanding one at that. I loved ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" - and while this is a completely different film, I found this to be as refreshing as that movie was. If you like Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"", or Jackie Chan's ""Police Story,"" you might just love this film - it's just as good and I can't give higher praise than that.  2-27-2005",1109462400,,695,4.088235294117647
2325051,5,B0009VBTQY,"Forget Jackie Chan, Our hero is Tony JAA!  Ong Bak has a pretty cool storyline, some ok Dialoug and SUPERB Fights!  The film doesn't have any strings attached, no crappy CGI like the Matrix, NO NOTHING.  ALL RAW AND REAL.  I just saw this film 20 minutes ago and I must say it's the best action film ever made!  I thought THE KILLER was but I was dead wrong.  The story is good but the main point for me was that I wanted Tony to survive, you feel for the poor guy.

The films Fighting and action is No holds bared, Raw and real....as good as it gets.  This film is the Best film you will see this year and you better see it quick cause it's limited release(just like Shaun of the Dead)..

Overall I have to say Ong-Bak has to be the best film I've see in 2005 and IS the best action film ever.  The characters are cool, the dioloug is ok, the story is a like/dislike thing for most people and the action is no holds bared..  I can't even express how amazing this film is.  You have to see it for your self.  Other then that...

FINAL SCORE

5 out of 5 stars.....IT'S THAT GOOD...

2325052,5,B0009VBTQY,"This one is well worth catching at the big screen if it happens to be playing close by, the action is very well done.  If you like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee or Jet Li, than this action adventure flick with plenty of fighting scenes will not disappoint.  The lead character, a young man named Ting, has to leave his village and go to Bangkok to try and track down a religious relic stolen from his village, when he gets there, he, as we might expect, gets more than he had bargained for running into a criminal gang.

While the production was behind our modern standards here in the states, and certainly wasn't as refined as movies like  Hidden Dragon or other modern Jackie Chan flicks, it easily competes with early Kung Fu movies and is on the same level as earlier Chan flicks that were done in China.

The athletic abilities and grace demonstrated by the lead were very skilled, and while some of the action sequences were obviously influenced by some of Chan's work, including inventive use of props and adding some humor to action, there was a lot here that was original in its form, at least to my eyes, and I think there is a big future, perhaps in American films, for the star.

My five star rating is based upon its place in this catagory of film, some of the acting is a bit cheesy, and being subtitled hurts a bit, however, in this genre it's easily a five star flick and I highly recommend it to fans of marital arts movies.",1108771200,9,1435,4.37593984962406
2325053,5,B0009VBTQY,"Simply put, this movie has the most impressive martial arts that I have ever seen. Done without any wires or CGI, the action in Ong Bak makes up for any deficiencies in the plot or acting, something I had thought impossible in a movie until recently. Tony Jaa's stunts and general physical abilities are simply beyond beleif. Watching Jaa jump over cars, run atop his enemy's heads and doing double front flips off obstacles many feet high, the reality of the film is just so much more impressive than big action movies currently replacing their actors with virtual ones. Granted, the Matrix is one of my favorite movies, but the action scenes just don't compare with those in Ong Bak . If you like action movies, you need to see Ong Bak.",1108684800,,738,4.598484848484849
2325054,5,B0009VBTQY,"You like Jackie Chan films? Or remember Bruce Lee? If so, don't miss this one from Thailand, where the film industry is thriving more than ever. And remember the name of Tony Jaa, stunt-turned-actor (incidentally, he was a stunt in the second 'Mortal Kombat' film, and his then co-worker was Ray Park, 'X-Men') Jaa's martial arts skills based on Muay Thai (Thai-style fighting) are simply astonishing.

[NO STUNTS, NO CGIs] Strangely titled film 'Ong-bak: Thai Warrior' is, as the title says, an exciting Thai actioner starring Tony Jaa (real name Panom Yeerum), who plays the hero Ting living in an apparently sleepy country in Thailand. Not exactly, you soon see. In this interesting opening scene, you see these scantily dressed guys climing up one big tree, and during the fighting, they fall one by one onto the ground. This is actually a kind of festival, or ritual, of the hero's village, but what you should realize is, the film uses NO CGIs, NO WIRES ATTACHED.

[FORGET THE STORY] Story? Need one? OK, Tony Jaa's hero has to track down the theives who cut off and stole the head of the sacred statue in his village. With this mission, he goes to town, where he meets one middle-aged man George, and his friend (perhaps girlfriend) Muay. Before you know it, they all got in troubles for the thugs start attack them.

[ACTIONS] Then, actions begin, which are simply eye-poping. One example: in the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the market, running away from the bad guys, Tony Jarr jumps over the tables, stalls, and cars (!) with Jackie's comic timing. And look how he slides into UNDER an RV! To add to them, he leaps through a ring of barbed wires (real ones, I suppose), and comes out unharmed, never stopping a moment!

Himself a Muay Thai fighter, Tony Jaa (or his character) joins in several illegal boxing bouts. You might say you have seen this kind of bloody, bone-crunching fight sequences in the past. Not Tony Jaa's high-kicking that strikes the opponent at the speed of lightening. This sounds like cliche, I know, but it is true, his agile movement reminds me of the deadly power of Bruce Lee and the ultra-fast speed of Jet Li.

And that's not the end, for Jaa does many, many other actions, which I refuse to write about here, for you should see them for yourself in theatres. Again, I say, Tony Jaa uses no stunts, no special effects or no strings. Of course, he will not win the Oscar for acting the hero of this film, but when he can fight like Lee, Chan, and Li, who cares?

My advice: 'Ong-bak' is a must for any fans who love action films. Watch it, and be surprised.",1108339200,125,2596,4.608225108225108
