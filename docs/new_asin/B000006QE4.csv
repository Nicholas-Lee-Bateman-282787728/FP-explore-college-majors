7904746,5,B000006QE4,"This is a great documentary! The Rippers real story is, in my opinion, MUCH more interesting than the myths. You can see clearly in here that there was absolutely NOTHING romantic, heroic, gallant, or sexy about this case whatsoever, as too many people often perceive. But I digress. The reinactments are my favorite part; the discoveries of Polly Nichols(victim #1)and Elizabeth Stride(#3)are SO eerie, as is the attack of Catherine Eddowes(#4), and the readings of the Ripper letters(reading them in the dialects by candlelight are enough to make your hair stand on end.)The discriptions of the victims injuries is just what you need for some nice insomnia. This is just plain scary, and even more so when you know it really happened. If you love scary stories/movies, this is for you!",1041120000,5,787,5.015267175572519
