8338324,5,B000HMHAFY,After watching the video I have a MUCH better appreciation for the Hong Kong airport...both the airport itself and then the transportation network leading to Hong Kong Island.  This DVD was SO interesting and you cannot help but think of all the logistic meetings that occurred behind the scenes and getting this facility to open on time.,1231200000,2,338,4.9298245614035086
