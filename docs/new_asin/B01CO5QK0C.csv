8753477,1,B01CO5QK0C,"This movie and the first part ATTACK OF A KILLER TOMATO is worthless piece of crap. I can't believe those people that review this movie gave it 4& 5 stars. There are 4 to 5 companies ripping off people by releasing some cheap unwatchable movies on BLURAY With a fancy packaging (cover art ,slip cover and case) from 70sand 80s Like ARROW VIDEO, SHOUT FACTORY, KINO LORBER and OLIVE FILMS.The prices are outrages and the movies are unwatchable.",1470873600,,443,4.6923076923076925

Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the produce aisle

I remember watching the original ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES when I was in my early teens, and I absolutely loved it.  Back then, the film was an obscure piece of schlocky filmmaking that was talked about in hushed towns among video store clerks.  The rarity of the film alone was enough to pique my interest, but I was a devoted fan after viewing it.

When I heard about RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, I knew I had to see it.  The same folks that did the original were involved with the sequel, so I figured I could expect much of the same craziness as before.  And sure enough, I was not disappointed.  In fact, I would go so far as to say the sequel topped the original.  And now, thanks to Arrow and MVD, we can now enjoy the insanity of killer vegetables in HD.

I don't care who you are or what your station is in lifeyou have to enjoy this film.  Theres just no way around it.  Its quirky and weird, and it never takes itself seriously.  How could you NOT enjoy it?

RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES is shot decently, although the cinematography is not something youll pay attention to in this film.  Surprisingly, the HD transfer is sketchy; some of the shots look great, while others are grainy and VHS-quality.  This is my sole complaint about the film, and its the reason I am giving it four stars instead of five.  Thankfully, the sound quality is great.

The acting in the film is exactly what youd expect from a picture like this.  Of interesting note is George Clooney, who plays a major role in the plot.  Theres no denying his signature stare or overbearing mullet, but he still does a fine job.  He is accompanied by screen legend John Astin, who portrays the insanely funny Professor Gangreen, and a whole slew of otherwise decent actors.

The plot of RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES is very simple, but that doesnt keep it from being fun.  Theres enough slapstick comedy and subtle gags to please even the heartiest comedy fan.  The film even spends a few minutes shamelessly plugging certain brand name items, in an attempt to appease corporate sponsors.  This is hilarious, especially given the fact Clooney is doing a major part of it.

RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES is a big win for me, and fans of comedy-horror should love it.  Whether you are watching it for the first time or revisiting memory lane, this film should have a definitive place in your movie library.  It is available now, so give it a look.",1469145600,2,2571,4.447537473233405
8753479,5,B01CO5QK0C,"The following review was originally published on my website Mind of Tatlock. Product was provided for review.

As I sat down with a nice refreshing cold can of Pepsi and popped in Big Breasted Girls Go To The Beach And Take Their Tops Off Return of the Killer Tomatoes, I knew that my night was going to be a delight. It could have been the tasty Pepsi or perhaps the crunchy and highly nutritious Kellogs Corn Flakes I happened to be eating that made me smile, but I like to think it was the fact that Return of the Killer Tomatoes knows exactly what I look for in an 80s horror/comedy. In the vein of hits like Airplane! and The Naked Gun, Return of the Killer Tomatoes is a spoof flick turned up to 11. Its an infectiously fun flick with ample laughs, product placement and fourth wall breaking that will make any movie fan smile. It also has George Clooney in it, who I assume doesnt like to admit he was.

Movie Review:

Return of the Killer Tomatoes picks up ten years after the crazy uprising of tomatoes. The Great Tomato War was a deadly time, but mankind was able to exterminate the red menace. Society has now put a ban on tomatoes, which results in our lead character Chads (Anthony Starke) pizza shack having some of the most disgusting pizzas ever.

Professor Gangreen (John Astin), who was behind the original tomato war, wants to bring back the killer tomatoes. He makes a device that when mixed with toxic waste, will turn tomatoes into shirtless Rambo men or sexy babes and the occasional celebrity. Its a rather confusing and nonsensical method using music, but it works. Professor Gangreens servant, the vivacious Tara escapes with a fuzzy mutated tomato and ends up in Chads arms. Chad and his friend Matt (George Clooney) aren't aware that Tara is actually a tomato in human form, but they will soon find out the truth, rocking Chad to the core. Meanwhile, Professor Gangreen sends out his sidekick Igor, an aspiring TV news anchor in the making, to find Tara, while he continues pumping out tomato men to make a giant army to take over the world. Eventually, the budget for the movie runs out and the only way to keep it going is by doing a ton of product placement resulting in a lot of laughs and a couple random cowboys and ninjas.

Return of the Killer Tomatoes is through and through a spoof that never once takes itself seriously. Its the kind of flick that you throw in, sit back and just laugh your ass off at. The plot is paper thin, the acting is over the top and the entire premise of the movie is pure genius. The only thing that could have made this movie any better was more big breasted girls taking their tops off at the beach.

Blu-ray Opinion:

I hate to admit it, but I solely place any sort of disappointment with this release on the lack of substantial special features. Now, Im not expecting a ton of interviews, but I would have enjoyed more. The one with do get with Anthony Starke is enjoyable, though. There is, however, an audio commentary with writer-director John De Bello and the colour booklet is an enjoyable enough read. Still, I really wish we could have had more people sit down and discuss this cult gem.

As for the audio/visual side of the disc, there will be no complaints coming from yours truly. The high definition 1080p transfer keeps the lovely grain intact, with no major damage. The uncompressed PCM audio option is loud and clear, blasting the Killer Tomatoes theme song through your speakers.

Verdict:

Even if the Return of the Killer Tomatoes Blu-ray is lacking features, I still highly recommend picking it up. The movie is a solid laugh riot, with its tongue firmly placed in cheek.",1469059200,4,3658,4.545592705167174
8753480,4,B01CO5QK0C,"Now Attack of the Killer Tomatoes has been one of the first (and that's totally debatable of course) so-bad-it's-good spoofs ever, while Return of the Killer Tomatoes, produced ten years later, came at a time when genre-conscious post-modern spoofs were aleady much more run-of-the-mill - and let's face it, story-wise the movie's not too great, basing itself too much on the original movie, and the characters in this one aren't exactly known for their depth, and even the humour is hit-or-miss ... but if it hits it really hits, there are scenes in Return of the Killer Tomatoes that are quite easily among the greatest comedy moments of the 1980s (and not just because later megastar George Clooney's in them) - including incredibly ill-placed product placement and the likeable determination to bring the film's joke's full circle (watch and you'll understand) - and the whole movie's understanding of genre tropes is just disarmingly charming ... and all this makes this not only a film that genre fans are sure to enjoy but also a near perfect party movie!",1468454400,,1062,4.97191011235955
8753481,3,B01CO5QK0C,"Return of the Killer Tomatoes is the sequel to 1978s Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, a silly film that was endearing because of its self-deprecating humor, over-the-top visuals, and goofy premise. In Return, its ten years after the first incursion by the marauding veggies. The world fears another uprising by the red menace as mad scientist Prof. Gangreen (John Astin, TVs The Addams Family) sets out to pursue his own twisted ends by creating an army of tomatoes made to look like humans, laying the groundwork for the second Great Tomato Uprising.

Director John de Bello has the right instincts about satirical silliness but fails to replicate the loopy tone of the original, despite efforts to make Return bigger, dopier, and more bizarre. The problem with comedy this broad is sustaining it. Though 98 minutes is generally a short running time, here it seems too lengthy. The jokes peter out, the visual gags seem more and more desperate, and much of the humor seems forced. There is also too much self-referencing of the film, which breaks down the fourth wall.

An interesting casting highlight is the appearance of George Clooney, complete with mullet, six years before his big break as Dr. Doug Ross in the TV series ER and eventual movie superstardom.

Blu-ray Special Edition features include new audio commentary with writer-director John de Bello; Hangin with Chad, a new interview with star Anthony Starke; image gallery containing rare behind-the-scenes stills; original theatrical trailer; TV spot; and reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork.",1468022400,,1582,5.196078431372549
8753482,3,B01CO5QK0C,"Review-A show of hands, who misses New World Video and what they meant to the video store experience? To see all these companies today putting out the old New World Video films on blu ray, I am as a fan stoked. Can we maybe get a Night Patrol blu ray? Tuff Turf (one of James Spaders best roles)? Angel? The list can go on and on but at least we got the film George Clooney would rather have you forget on blu ray. The guys who were responsible for the original in the 70s, re-teamed in the 80s to do the first sequel to that film. This film is purposely bad and cheesy, you will find more cornball moments in this film than jaw-dropping. We have the evil scientist Dr. Gangreen who is in his place turning tomatoes which are now outlawed into human using music and radioactive waste. It is up to Chad and Matt to stop this from happening. This film is more cheesy than the first one, where the first one tried to have some serious tone at times to it, this film gets that it is part of a in-joke. There is a bad product placement scene that will make most of us roll our eyes but yet smirk.

 George Clooney really showcases in this film that he is going to move on to bigger and better things. The film really has fun and as bad as this film gets, the fun of this film kept me watching and wanting more bad. The humor in this film is really hit and miss, and maybe some will also infer that it is a lot more miss than I just said, but they cannot deny that this film really is so damn silly that you cannot help but get into this film. I would say the best experience to watch this film, a group of friends all sitting around the tube and just having a blast narrate this film. This film made me cry for the age of the video store to come back again. If this film was made today, they would overthink it and it would line up on the SYFY channel. We need studios like New World and films like this to remind us that sometime life is not about folding your arms and expecting a film to give you what you are entitled about, but just remembering that film is a good medium that should be more respected for what it truly is. Good or bad, this film will make you forget about the outside world for a moment and get dumbed down by its cheese.
