4462360,1,B004SG6B14,"This video is in a foreign language, I think Korean or something. It is of no use to me at all. I was misinformed when I bought it. Not even any subtitles, just gobbledegook. I am pissed. The only reason I gave it one star is because this review won't progress without one star",1353110400,2,277,4.148148148148148

4462362,5,B004SG6B14,"This DVD is a wonderful look at the animals who inhabit Africa and is well
worth the time spent reading it and the money spent buying it.

The seller of this DVD must be commended for incredibly fast service!!",1311552000,3,209,4.358974358974359
4462363,5,B004SG6B14,"We happened upon this movie about 20 years ago on cable, videotaped it and our kids basically wore out the tape with repeated watching.  We were thrilled to find it available on DVD so we can watch it with our grandkids now!  The movie shows the cycle of life and season in the Pre-Namib and Kalihari desert regions of South Africa with a sense of humor that will be enjoyed by young kids to adults. The narration is first-rate, delivered with a dry (pun intended) humor that suits the movie perfectly.  This movie shows the daily struggle for survival by the animals and native people of the region, with humorous attention given to the similarities in behavior between animal and human societies, hence the title ""Animals are Beautiful People"".  The depictions of animal behavior range from poignant to slapstick, keeping a viewer interested through the entire movie.  Be warned, your kids will likely want to watch this one again and again.",1306454400,9,943,4.832298136645963

8439681,5,B004SG6B14,"Love this movie. The scene with the ""drunken"" animals from eating the fallen fermented fruit is absolutely hilarious. Narrator that did this movie also did Gods Must Be Crazy 1 and 2, (also 5's BTW).",1419379200,,199,4.714285714285714
8439682,5,B004SG6B14,One of the best kept secrets in the world of film! The things captured on tape give us a front row seat into viewing these creatures in their natural habitats. I love for my grandchildren to see the souls and humor that exist in the wild. This is genius work and it feels as if it were done today not in 1974. It is timeless and priceless!,1406246400,,339,4.074626865671642
8439683,3,B004SG6B14,"The female actress who played the cook part was terrible. She way over-acted. The play format is awful for a movie.
The singing was boring and not part of the plot.

HOWEVER:  Medea was hilarious as usual and we need more of the same, minus lousy supporting actors and
actresses. Tyler Perry so outshines everyone playing Medea.",1395187200,,328,4.7368421052631575
