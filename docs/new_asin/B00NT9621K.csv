6679508,3,B00NT9621K,"Nicky (Ben Barnes) is an overly cocky punk criminal. His slow witted cousin George (Slaine) does his dirty work as Nicky doesn't have the guts to do his own killing, but he is willing to take the credit. Nicky gets his dream of becoming ""family"" by ""the gun and the knife"" as their code states.

He quickly gets in over his head as he hasn't outgrown being a punk and his cousin causes additional rifts with his free lance schemes.

Nicky is given advice ""When you are young, you have options. Later on you don't. Enjoy the summer, it will soon be winter."" This nice little metaphor was part of the dialogue which I thought was fairly decent. The characters were all the same that we have seen in all these other mafia-crime films. Nicky, our main character is not likeable by design. George becomes our next criminal protagonist, but things change there too. There was no subplot of cops investigating killings or any criminal activity, as the film centered on Nicky, who was in nearly every scene.

While the film wasn't bad, about the waning days of organized crime, it wasn't a film that will stick in your mind. Makes for a good rental.

6679519,3,B00NT9621K,"Set in Boston we meet Nick Tortano (Ben Barnes) he works for Salvatore Vitaglia (Harvey Keitel) in what is seen as the dying days of Sicilian mob rule - with the new eastern Europeans taking over. Nick just wants to be a `made man' and in doing so has become estranged to his father, but has a best bud in George (Slaine) who sort of gives him a leg up - but he has more of  a taste for wanton killing than does Nick.

Throw into the mix a little illicit gambling, the ubiquitous lap dancing club and a stereotype Mafiosi or two and you have the general ingredients for a decent film. But this has all the pieces in the wrong place, the slow burn lacks any menace to keep you interested and when the violence does come it is so rushed that you could almost miss it. There is no exploration of the new wave of gangsters or the police doing a single thing - which is a bit odd but would have added something to an otherwise stagily linear narrative.

No-one was dusting off the awards cabinet for this one either, but Slaine was good and Keitel can do no wrong. Barnes as a lead was just too nice to be convincing, but did a fair fist of it. This is one that is probably ok for a rental with some beers, as indeed I did, but it is no way going to be a keeper. If you love all things mob related then it is probably worth a go, but do not expect to be blown away.",1432512000,,1360,4.011070110701107

I'm not a prude, I enjoy the Godfather series, Good Fellows, etc, but this was boring. Absolutely boring. Ben Barnes' talent was completely wasted in this project. I hope he has better projects in the future because he was the only reason I watched this and I couldn't finish it!",1431388800,,410,4.554054054054054
6679521,3,B00NT9621K,"When a man takes the oath to become a made guy in the Mafia, he promises to put the family before anything else. For most gangsters, this never becomes an issue, but for Nick Tortano (Ben Barnes) it becomes the basis for an impossible decision. A series of events lead Tortano into having to decide between his new family and his old one. Either choice means that someone he loves will become a target, and he has to decide, who in his life is the most expendable. Most films about the Mafia follow a very specific pattern, leading people to say all these films are the same. There is some truth to that, but By The Gun is certainly an exception. The film follows a new member is a small family and the story told from his point of view, giving us a very different look at La Costa Nostra. Ben Barnes stars in one of his first leading roles and was outstanding. Barnes, mostly recognized as an ancillary character from the Chronicles of Narnia series, finally steps into the spotlight and shows that he has what it takes to star. I was impressed with the story and setting of this film, but I wasn't crazy about the cast, in fact, there were several actors who really brought the quality of this movie down, but Ben Barnes wasn't one of them. His performance really added some legitimacy to this film and if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be recommending it at all. By The Gun is not your typical Mafia movie, because Nick Tortano isn't your typical gangster. He has a conscience that comes into conflict with his life of crime at every turn and watching him decide the fate of everyone he loves was really something worth watching.",1431216000,,1631,4.44
6679522,3,B00NT9621K,"The film is about a young guy that wants to be a made man (Mobster) but he is not willing to do the work to get there. Unfortunately, once he takes the pledge there is no turning back. This not my definition of an action film but it had enough to keep me watching. This is a drama about what would force someone to join the mob against the wishes of everyone he cares about. The acting is bearable across the board and the storyline has so much going on that it should keep you interested. There has family drama, peer pressure issues, romance issues and it even makes attempts at comedy. But most importantly what would make this guy finally do the things that the Mob wanted in the first place?",1430611200,2,696,4.28030303030303

6679524,4,B00NT9621K,"There's a lot of predictable storyline in By the Gun.  Wannabe Southie Bawstuhn boy, Nick, has been trying to work his way up the Mafia food chain.  With help from his big bud and protector, George, Nick makes good and earns his stripes.

Down the road Nick starts dating the daughter is another Made Guy.  The girl doesn't much like daddy until she find out he's been killed.  Meanwhile, in a manhunt looking for Nick, Nick's Pop gets popped and dies leaving Nick to fend for younger brother Vito.

It is a rather dark movie.  There's not as much shooting and killing as many films of this ilk.  There is gratuitous violence after Nick finds his newfound girlfriend shot in her bed.

There certainly are worse movies out there and definitely better ones as well.  Over all, this should satisfy the desire for an ""I wanna watch a Mafia movie,"" but it will leave you wanting something with more action.

As a bonus, Harvey Keitel stars.  He alone is worth the price is admission.",1426982400,,978,4.557471264367816
6679525,1,B00NT9621K,"Mind-blowingly dull New York City mob film about a young turk named Nick (Ben Barnes) who dreams of being a made man.  By the Gun very obviously wants to be 2014's answer to Martin Scorcese's classic New York crime films Mean Streets and Goodfellas--especially the former.  By the Gun takes place in a different world than the Scorcese films--the mob has far less influence than it once did and its members are getting old and dying off.  Harvey Keitel's Salvatore sums things up for Nick early in the film--to be a wise-guy now you either have to go straight or accept that you're an island because the idea of the crime family is an anachronism in today's world where most crime is controlled by gangs that couldn't care less about those old Italian dudes playing mafia for the tourists.  It's actually a provocative idea but, unfortunately, By the Gun isn't the movie that's going to tell that story.

I will give this credit to the filmmakers behind By the Gun--they create a world that is detailed enough to feel real and believable--the problem is that they never come up with anything interesting to happen in it.  Ben Barnes lacks the kinetic energy or charisma of a young Robert DeNiro from Mean Streets or Taxi Driver and while you can't really fault an actor for not having the talent of a young DeNiro By the Gun still could have found an actor with more charisma and energy.

By the Gun is a movie completely devoid of tension or momentum or energy--it just crawls with no sense of urgency, challenging the patience of even the most indulgent viewers and missing the most obvious lesson from Mean Streets--energy is contagious.  If you create onscreen movement of your actors and of your camera the audience is drawn in whether they want to be or not.  By the Gun, in contrast, is almost entirely static--a deadly dull protagonist trapped in scenes that go on way too long and never seem to be headed anywhere.

Harvey Keitel and Tobey Jones offer a little spark in small supporting roles.  Ritchie Coster as Tony Matazano is supposed to recall the crazy hoods that Joe Pesci used to play but he comes across more like a silly wannabe than scary real deal.  Leighton Meester as a mobster's daughter that Nick falls for is likable but seems to be in a different movie than the rest of the cast.

There have been lots of mediocre mob movies including Kill the Irishman, Blood Ties, Bad Country and  Rage--home video seems to be littered with these things lately but all of those films managed at least a modest amount of suspense in individual scenes.  By the Gun doesn't have even one single, solitary moment of suspense or dramatic interest--it will very likely put you to sleep if you watch it late at night.  If you run out of sleeping pills you might want to give By the Gun a spin but there's no other reason to endure it.",1426896000,3,2839,4.5810276679841895

6679528,1,B00NT9621K,"Having just watched Ben Barnes in SONS OF LIBERTY I was expecting a decent low budget movie when I put this one in. Instead I found one of the most boring crime flicks Ive seen in ages filled with so many clich moments that it took everything in me to stay awake until the end.

Barnes plays Nick, a low level criminal in Boston who dreams of making the big time and becoming a member of the local mob. Working menial crimes and doing things on the side just to make a living, Nick also has to watch out for his family. For example a family member insults the daughter of a mob boss and Nicks boss (a wasted use of Harvey Keitel) makes him apologize to the boss. Except that this boss insults him non-stop before he lets him off the hook.

When Nick goes to apologize to the daughter as well she gives him a rough time. Of course you know the two of them will end up in love with one another. Trust me when I say this is not a set up for a Romeo and Juliet moment.

Nick continues to desire to be a made man, a killer for the mob, so that he can join the upper echelon. When hes finally given the opportunity he cant bring himself to pull the trigger so his best friend does it for him. Nick gets the credit, is sworn into the mob and then discovers more problems when this same friend kidnaps the mob boss that insulted Nick. With nowhere to go, with no options open to him, the end draws near for Nick and his life of crime.

With some solid locations and decent photography the movie could have been much better. Too many long winded speeches with phony sounding dialogue, a meandering story that never draws you in and some side plots like Nicks father who wants nothing to do with him because of his choices end up making a boring flick that does little more than waste your time. If you feel the need to watch any movie starring Keitel then by all means watch him wasted in this role. As for Barnes I hope he gets better material to work with in the future than this.",1425168000,2,1973,4.143603133159269

6679540,4,B00NT9621K,"BY THE GUN is a well written, extremely well directed and acted Mob movie that suffers from the fact that it was produced on such a low budget that it could not afford major stars to play its key characters.  Indeed, the only recognizable names in the picture are Harvey Keitel and Toby Jones, and their roles are secondary.

I am definitely not saying that stars would have performed any better in the leading roles.  Ben Barnes, Leighton Meester, Ritchie Coster, Paul Ben-Victor and, in particular, Slaine are all terrific in their assignments.  But, the reality is that stars can draw more attention to a picture, and the productions financial limitations doomed the film to a limited theatrical release before going to home video, which is a shame because BY THE GUN  is definitely worth seeing.

Barnes stars as a young criminal who dreams of becoming a made man in the Boston Mob.  His problem is that he does not really have the heart to go all the way, and when he is assigned to carry out a hit, he cannot pull the trigger.  Leighton Meester plays the estranged daughter of a Mafioso with whom Barnes becomes involved and Slaine is his more ruthless best friend.

Directed by James Mottern from a screenplay by Emillo Mauro, BY THE GUN  is an atmospheric, unpredictable gangster movie that certainly deserves more attention than it will probably get because of its limited release.

The Blu-ray/DVD from Millennium Entertainment contains audio commentary by Mottern, Mauro and Barnes, plus several deleted scenes.

6679541,4,B00NT9621K,"As written by Emilio Mauro and directed by James Mottern BY THE GUN is another Boston Mafia flick, but this one is a bit more sensitive to character development and conflicts of the gang world than most. Perhaps most of that is due to Ben Barnes very exceptional portrayal of the lead character, but kudos must be passed around to a supporting cast that is less concerned with star turns then depicting the miasma of Mafioso life, perhaps the most dysfunctional concept of `family' ever created.

Nick Tortano (Ben Barnes) is a smooth-talking, ladies man, ambitious criminal from the streets of Boston. After years spent working for and idolizing the Italian gangsters he finally proves himself to the boss Salvatore Vitaglia (Harvey Keitel) and becomes a made man. However, once inside, Nick conflicts with a moneymaker for the Mafia and begins to drive a wedge between him and Boss. In the sidebars, Nick's `driver' is the fat but fearless George Mullins (Slaine) who makes Nick's initial difficult kill for him, Nick's real father (Paul Ben-Victor) and younger brother Vito (an impressive turn for Kenny Wormald), a love affair with Ali Matazano (Leighton Meester), and various conflicts with Salvatore's enemies. There are some fine minor character roles by Toby Jones, Ron Komora, Tully Banta-Cain, William Bloomfield, Richie Coster and others, but basically this is Ben Barnes film -a confused young man who makes some wrong choices but does so in a manner that keeps our compassion.

Not a great film, nor does it pretend to be, but for a small Indie look at the autopsy of the Boston Mafia it fares well. Grady Harp, December 14",1419638400,2,1636,4.945454545454545
