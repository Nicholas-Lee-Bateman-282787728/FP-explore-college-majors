It's pretty great -- they explain exactly how to build a road and provide interesting visuals. My only complaint is that the DVD is basically just the show -- there isn't a menu or anything. Since it was made back in the early 90s, the film quality isn't great either. Still, it's worth a watch if your kid likes construction vehicles!",1461628800,,443,4.349397590361446

563846,5,6303123279,"My 3 year old son loved this video. He watched it compulsively (as did I, snuggled next to him on the couch.) Years later, I gave a copy to a good friend's son, and It took almost 2 years for his wife to forgive me because all Adam wanted to do was watch Road Construction Ahead. I have now given a copy to my 3 year old grandson, and I hope his mother will be more accepting.
The fascination of young boys for giant construction machines is quite impressive, and the machines in this video are massive, powerful earthmovers. I learned the difference between a payloader and a backhoe, among other things. If you want your little boy to be glued to the tube for hours, this is for you. You may find it hard to pry him away for essentials such as meals, however.

I was so disappointed that they shirked their duty to describe the machines and activities.  Kids are way smarter than the people doing these videos think they are; they absorb and they relate and they 'connect the dots' and are very intuitive.  I hate when people talk down to kids and I hate when videos cheat them out of a great learning experience.  Even so, my grandson watched it 3 times.  It was very short, too.....30 minutes.

We passed it on to another family with 2 boys....and we're now buying the DVD for our 2 year old nephew.  This is the one tape that is an absolute, guaranteed, 100% hit with every little boy I've ever known.  The 30-minute movie takes you through all the steps of road building, from surveying all the way through paving and up to the first car driving on the new road.

Several times the camera zooms in close or moves in slow motion so the kids can really get a good look at what is going on. It is about 30 minutes, which is a convenient length and about right for his attention span. My 6 and 9 year old daughters have even been known to watch with him occasionally.

We showed it to him for the first time when he was about three months old and he was HOOKED!  He's now almost two and it's still his very favorite video.  He'd watch it daily if we'd let him!  Lots of action, little dialogue, lots of things kids love: adults waving at the camera, men shouting ""Come on boys!"" to round up the troups, and of course, a huge variety of earth-moving equipment in both close up and far away shots.

This exceeded my expectations and then some. Not only are they mesmerized for the entire half hour but they have actually learned a thing or two. The action follows the building of a road from start to finish so there is plenty to learn - not just a jumble of big machines footage. And I could expand on the narrators explanations very easily when the boys wanted it. Heck, even I learned a few things. If only all kid videos were this good.",999129600,12,614,4.394736842105263
564440,4,6303123279,"Road Construction Ahead really held my 2-year old's attention.  The focus is on the machines themselves: the loaders, diggers, backhoes, etc.  The only part of this video he didn't like was the sequences of dynamite blowing up the earth, and the cheesy reverse-action video showing the earth reassembling itself (the explosion in reverse).  During this sequence he motivated himself to learn operation of the Fast Forward button on the VCR!
I borrowed this video, and had to return it.  In lieu of this, I borrowed ""There Goes a Bulldozer"" (featuring Construction Foreman Dave), which features a goofy narrator playing for laughs left and right.  Only THEN did I realize just how good ""Road Construction Ahead"" is.  My son kept asking for Road Construction Ahead, even when Dave's video was playing!
I think I can speak for two year olds when I say that THEY WANT TO SEE THE MACHINES.  My son liked Road Construction Ahead MUCH more than ""There Goes a Bulldozer,"" and I highly recommend it.

About 10% narration, and 90% action footage -- the kids won't get bored.  My four year old son would watch this 5 times each day if we let him.  My 2.5 year old daughter finds it much less interesting.
The video takes you through the very start (surveying) to the very end (laying the asphalt) of the road building process  -- with a nice balance of detail and fast pacing.  The music that accompanies the video seems a bit cheesy, but I'm  not going to mark off for that since my son doesn't seem to mind.
