4699929,5,B005HI4LMS,"This is a truly hilarious movie that spoofs the horror genre in a brilliant way. I haven't laughed so much at a film for years. I don't understand why this film hasn't got a wide release. So much of what Hollywood produces these days is a yawn-fest, and here is a funny, original movie that so few people will ever get to see. It's a complete mystery. I eagerly await the DVD release, as this movie will be a gem in my collection.",1302566400,5,430,4.192771084337349
4699930,5,B005HI4LMS,"''Tucker and Dale vs. Evil'' is such a hilarious and original movie. It will be a real shame if director Eli Craig will not make another part for ''Tucker and Dale'' series. It's a really awesome comedy with very well written script. After seeing many Hollywood comedies, this is what I would call a ''comedy of the year''. And the cast for the movie is really great. All actors done a very great job. Exceptionally I love Allison(Katrina Bowden) and those 2 main heroes: Tyler Labine(Dale) and Alan Tudyk(Tucker). They've done a really great job and those 3 are my favorite actors from now on. As for me, I'd love to have a chance to meet Katrina Bowden and Tyler Labine in real life. If that'd be possible I'd love to see them 3 in another movies. It's an exceptional hell of a great movie and it is a must have!
I see no downsides but that I hunger for more : )",1301270400,4,864,4.306748466257669

4699941,4,B005HI4LMS,"RELEASED IN 2010 and written & directed by Eli Craig, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a comedy/horror about genial West Virginian hillbillies Tucker & Dale (Alan Tudyk & Tyler Labine) who visit their newly acquired rundown cabin-in-the-woods wherein they are mistaken as psycho hilljack killers by a group of vacationing college youths.

This is a well-done lampoon of flicks like Deliverance (1972) Wrong Turn (2003) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). Besides being consistently amusing, what works best is that you get to know Tucker and, especially, Dale, as well as the main girl (Katrina Bowden), whos very reminiscent of Christine Taylor (from The Brady Bunch Movie), albeit taller. Freckled cutie Chelan Simmons looks her best clad in daisy dukes throughout. The coniferous woods give away that this was shot in the Great Northwest and not West Virginia, where the events purportedly take place.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 29 minutes and was shot Alberta, Canada (e.g. Cochrane & Bottrel). ADDITIONAL WRITER: Morgan Jurgenson.

GRADE: B",1516752000,,1040,5.178571428571429

4699943,5,B005HI4LMS,"Something for everybody (kidding). Very funny, very dark, very graphic deaths!.
Spoilers herein:
Tyler Labine is funnier than I would have guessed, given his North-of-the-US heritage. Tyler and Alan Tudyk's onscreen bromance is just 2 fairly clueless guys trying to live their dream while a group of witch-hunting teens are ...disposed of in graphic and hilarious fashion, usually by their own hand but with the help of leftover traps courtesy of the previous cabin's inhabitant. The plot is a fun-to-watch twist on the usual murder cabin deep in the woods, resulting in our pair of hapless everymans being literally soaked in circumstantial evidence and the eviscera of a group of stereotypical horror movie teens. There's a graphic gore, plenty of lulz and gigs, a love story plot line. Just a good time all around",1516233600,,816,5.097014925373134

4699954,4,B005HI4LMS,"4/5  TUCKER & DALE VS EVIL gleefully subverts the cabin in the woods horror sub-genre, and does so to good effect. Its gorily comical and manages to sustain what is basically a one-joke premise pretty well throughout the 90 minute running-time. The cast throw themselves into the fray with enthusiasm and Tudyk and Labine in particular are perfect for their roles as the misunderstood, hapless hillbillies. It does test the viewers willingness to accept some unlikely coincidences and absurd pratfalls but the likeability of the two main leads, and the knowing tone of the grisly humour, makes it easy to forgive these shortcomings. Great fun.",1511395200,,643,5.123809523809523

4699997,5,B005HI4LMS,I don't know how no one thought of this idea earlier it's a basic idea that executes with power. The chemistry between the two friends is unexplainable. It's the perfect wix of sweet and spice. It gets a little cheese from time to time. But that only adds to the emotional effects you feel threw out the film. This film is for comedy fan that are sick of the typical comedy's that have come out the last 10 years that are for children. It's extremely dark and twisted. I wouldn't call it a horror but it's not a straight out comedy either. I can't suggest nor speak to kind of this film if I wanted to. 10 outta 10 no doubt.,1492819200,,624,4.1652892561983474

The serene and peaceful nature of the film left me warm and nurtured. In many ways much like ""A River Runs Through It"", the beautiful surroundings and settings makes one wishful to be taken away to a magical forest with a best friend.

Essentially, the good intentions of backwoods country rustic hillbillies Tucker and Dale devolve into a series of misunderstandings  due to stereotypical mischaracterizations; including, accompanying tragic consequences.

Basic story is 2 rednecks (Tucker & Dale) cross paths with some college kids & a series of strange events occur after a misunderstanding & lack of communication (don't spoil the fun for those that haven't seen it). It was enjoyable from beginning to end. The kills were all very well done with some real good SFX. Cast did a great job, especially the actors who played Tucker & Dale. Some good special features on the disc also, including seeing things from the perspective of the college kids called Tucker & Dale Are Evil.

4700223,5,B005HI4LMS,"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is, just simply, pure fun!  The way the film turns horror film clichs on their head is genius, and completely original.  Like the Scream franchise, it mixes in plenty of laughs with some very real scares, which is a fantastic combination.

Tucker and Dale are funny, sweet and utterly likeable hillbillies; naive and good-hearted but not dumb, which gives the film a rare dose of heart.  You find yourself not only wanting the titular heroes to survive, but to have a happy ending.

The film has a surprisingly good-natured spirit, unlike too many horror films that leave you feeling queasy, depressed and in need of a shower.  There's blood, to be sure, and some language, but no nudity/sex or ugly scenes of graphic torture, and even the college kids aren't the totally nasty sleazeball creeps they often are in typical screamers.

You'll walk away with a giggle, a smile, and great affection for these two redneck heroes.  Check it out!",1476057600,,962,4.787878787878788

4700228,5,B005HI4LMS,"I don't know if this one has a cult following, but if it doesnt, it should. While it has a slight Evil Dead vibe, small cabin in the woods and people dying in crazy ways, it has its own originality as well.

Tucker and Dale (Tyler Labine, whom I adore in Deadbeat and Reaper) are friends who go up to Tuckers cabin to fix it up. On their way up, they run into some college kids who instantly judge them as being hillbillies. While Dale wants the kids to like them, Tucker could care less. They continue their way up to the cabin, and upon seeing it, the audience gets an instant creepy vibe, but Tucker and Dale are ecstatic to have a get-away home.

While Dale and Tucker are checking out the cabin, Chad tells his friends a story about a Memorial Day Massacre, and the hillbillies who did all the killing. Through things we see in the cabin, the audience realizes that must have been where they lived.

All of the kids just want to have a good time, except for Chad, who just seems a bit off, and wants to start some stuff with Tucker and Dale. The kids decide to go for a skinny dip later that evening, and one of the women falls into the lake and hits her head. Dale saves her and they bring her back to the cabin. This is where the fun begins.

In a constant stream of miscommunication between the kids and Tucker and Dale, one accidental death leads to more, and finally an all out assault between the two groups. The deaths just keep getting crazier, and the final reveal, isn't shocking but its amusing.

Highly recommend this one if you enjoy the Evil Dead or Shaun of the Dead.",1475798400,,1587,4.259136212624584

Hilarious and although you know people are going to die...it happens in unexpected ways. I would recommend against watching the trailer, though...too many spoilers.",1471910400,,326,4.945454545454545
4700249,4,B005HI4LMS,"A group of college kids head out into the woods for a weekend of tomfoolery at the same time good-hearted hillbillies Tucker and Dale take possession of their new holiday shack. When Tucker and Dale rescue one of the college girls after she injures herself, her friends think she's been abducted. Misunderstandings escalate out of control, until both groups believe they're being hunted by psychopaths and resolve to defend themselves no matter what.

Comedy movies which riff off horror themes have been around for a while now, starting with the magnificent Evil Dead movies in the 1980s, continuing with the likes of Scream and Shaun of the Dead, and recently resurging thanks to the excellent Cabin in the Woods. Tucker and Dales Versus Evil is a fine addition to this pantheon of movies which seek to scare and amuse at the same time.

This is a quite clever movie which invokes almost ever single trope on the horror table: a bunch of teenage kids out in the woods drinking alcohol and taking drugs, chainsaws, people being picked off one-by-one, buildings burning down and a final confrontation in a sawmill. What makes the movie work so brilliantly is that the whole thing kicks off due to misunderstandings and the belief of the characters in what will happen based on their own exposure to horror movies. In fact, you could re-edit the movie to take place entirely from either Tucker and Dale's POV or that of the kids and you'd entirely get where each side is coming from.

That said, the movie doesn't hold an entirely unbiased view of what's going on: our sympathies are firmly with Tucker and Dale throughout the picture. Alan Tudyk (Firefly) plays Tucker, the somewhat more savvy of the two hillbillies (or so it first appears), with his usual brilliant comic timing but the heart of the picture belongs to Tyler Labine (Reaper) as Dale, whose early dumb schtick masks a much smarter and more resourceful person. One of the underlying premises of the movie is that Dale is trying to woo college girl Allison (a sympathetic performance by Katrina Bowden) which initially seems ridiculous but the actors actually sell the idea they might be just about right for one another. These kind of relationships are usually contrived in both horror and comedy films, but this one works just fine.

The college kids are less sympathetic, bringing about most of their stupidity and ludicrously gory deaths on themselves. Debut director Eli Craig seems to take glee in working out how each one is going to meet their end and then outdoes himself with the next one (although the woodchipper scene remains the most memorable death in the movie).

So the film is well-played, hilarious and takes a wry, smart look at the tropes of horror movies that pays homage to them (even fellow horror-comedies, as The Evil Dead 2 gets several shout-outs). The film does have two, relatively minor, weaknesses. First is that it is a little too quick to cut to the chase. Based on the effectively frantic pacing, the movie should really be over at around the 70 minute mark and the team then have to drag out the finale to get the film up to feature length. Perhaps a little more scene-setting at the start and making the college kids more interesting and sympathetic would have helped the audience care more when they start expiring.

Secondly, the film doesn't entirely have the courage of its convictions and ultimately drops in a real murderous killer into the story. I agree that it would be tough to let the carnage keep playing out as the result of a case of mistaken identity (although they do manage it for more than half of the movie), but it would have been interesting to see them try. Having a real bad guy in the film does kind of feel like it's going against its own premise.

Tucker and Dale Versus Evil (****) is spectacularly gory, extremely funny and cleverer than it first appears, but can't quite maintain the brilliance of its first half all the way to the end. But it's still an outrageously entertaining slice of horror-comedy.",1471651200,,4035,4.763948497854077

4700289,3,B005HI4LMS,"Nicely acted by Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk, and with an interesting (for 5 minutes) one-joke premise - the Deliverance-styled leads are gentle and good-hearted, whereas the cute college kids are almost psycho - but in any event, the main similarity between this gore-fest outing and standard issue product remains:  misunderstanding or not, the college kids are still fodder for slaughter.  As I get older, this kind of random horror - comic becomes less appealing to me, but yet I watch, as a former horror fan, the unending bleakness of contemporary horror all the same increasingly depressing. It is, however, somewhat amusing to see the tropes observed and then upended. But MUST there always be a Final Girl? One more interesting, subtle, secondary point - the backwoods heroes are the competent ones, knowing how to woodwork, survive, handle a wood-chipper, understand the weapons, and so forth, while the pampered college kids are picked off one by one generally because of their cluelessness - their worldly inexperience and their failure to understand just how ""things really work."" It becomes a reverse-snobbery, classist polemic after all, and, at heart, virulently Republican. And I don't think I am reading too much into this.  The best element, of course, is the performance of sweet-nature Alan Tudyk, who adds sincere generosity and chemistry whenever he shares the screen - by comparison, the equally adept Tyler Labine is perhaps a shade too caricatured. But by only a shade. A one-joke comedy with an oddly-cast kid villain (dressed for the 1980s, also an odd choice), and with, yes, plenty of gore - the gorehounds will find it a modestly satisfying amuse-bouche. But one cannot help but wonder, at the end of the day, about so many kids dispatched (the body count is, let's see... 10? 11?...), and each with so little mutual regard - did these kids just meet on craigslist one hour before they took off for spring break? Summary: Heartless one-joke horror ""comedy"", with few laughs, lots of gore, a good pair of leading men, a standard-issue beauty-in-peril who does little but look concerned, and - for me - the more-interesting secondary premise - it's not just that the bromancer hillbillies are actually the heroes, sweet-natured and misunderstood, no, but that Tucker and Dale are, in the face of horror and misunderstanding, sensitive, shocked, and, above all - COMPETENT.",1462060800,,2400,5.086294416243655

4700318,4,B005HI4LMS,"Two rednecks, Tucker (Tyler Labine) and Dale (Alan Tudyk of Firefly fame), head out to their vacation home, a cabin in the woods. At the same time, a bunch of college students head out to the same woods for a pot/beer/sex-filled camping weekend. The two groups run across each other at a convenience store and gas station where initial impressions are negative ones. Tucker thinks one of the girls is cute but he gets tongue-tied talking to her, so he comes off as creepy. The college kids come off as stuck-up and better-than-you, none more so than Chad. That night Tucker and Dale go fishing and the college kids go skinny-dipping in the same lake. One of the girls, Allison, accidentally falls and hits her head. Tucker dives in to save her. When he and Dale call out to her friends, the friends all assume they are some sort of hillbilly psychos kidnapping their friend. The kids run away screaming, leaving Tucker and Dale to take Allison to their cabin and nurse her back to health. In the morning, Chad wants to arm up and take her back by force. Things escalate in hilarious and horrible ways from there.

The movie is an amazing blend of horror tropes and comedy. It does a great job of turning expectations on their heads. All of the kills are horrible accidents that are misinterpreted in the worst possible way by the characters in the movie. The college kids think the rednecks are offing them one by one. The rednecks think the college kids have formed some suicide pact. Grim but laugh-out-loud humor permeates the story.

The movie makers could have left this as a blood-soaked comedy of errors but were actually able to add some heart. Tucker and Allison come to an understanding of each other rather quickly as everything else around them spirals out of control. They give the movie some sane, likable characters to root for, something sorely lacking in other horror movies. They actually care about each other and try to fix the situation, though again with comic stumbles that drive the story forward. I found the writing surprisingly intelligent in these situations.

This movie is a one-joke premise, but its a pretty good joke.  Tudyk and especially Labine are very good and the rest of the cast is perfectly adequate.

The hillbillies, played perfectly by Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk, are unique movie creations. They're a pair of good guys who stumble into the perception that they're backwoods killers, and the dumb college students fall for it because they can't see past their own arrogance and prejudices. I couldn't wait to see how the next kid did him or herself in - they were that unlikeable.

We meet Tucker and Dale, two good 'ol boys who are off to spend a weekend at their newly purchased camp.  However, right there is where things go as far from the typical horror movie format.  Tucker and Dale are the ""victims"" of a bizarre set of murders around their camp.  They run into a bunch of college kids, led by a slightly ""off"" leader, who proceed to bumble themselves into an early grave.  Tucker and Dale see this carnage happening all around them and think it is some kind of suicide cult.  Laughs ensure, as we bond with the two hillbillies, as they try to escape the impending fate with their ""college kid psycho killer"".  Go into this ready to laugh.

Or that it's a commentary on how we view people though a system of social inequalities rather then for who they are but... there's a lot more here if you want it. It's a fun romp though some horror cliche, but it also pokes at the construction in most ""cabin in the woods"" style horrors of the middle class college kids defeating the rural, and evil visa via detachment lower class, a construction that I, as an ivy league grad that grew up in a trailer in the boonies, found to be all too true. A fun time, but it also shows us how a word like villain came to mean what villain does (look it up), based on the interaction between classes and the assumptions that arise therein. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, a little more deep then you would thing, and has a good fight scene with a chain saw. You should watch this.",1440720000,,869,4.178571428571429

This movie had a lighthearted twist to all those blood and guts hillbilly chainsaw movies (even though it has a wood chipper in it).  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

4700607,5,B005HI4LMS,"This move was not as funny as I thought it would be, and, in a way, that was OK.

I thought it would be a straight out exploitation parody of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" genre, and it did go in that way, but instead of going for nothing but laughs, it presented likable ""hillbilly"" characters with solid actors, including Alan Tudyk from Firefly, to play them.

So, the movie actually ended up with a plot, and a burgeoning romance between one of the hillbillies and one of the college kids, as they worked out their mutual misapprehensions about each other's strange culture.

And, of course, there was a bunch of silly, implausible slapstick self-immolations as the college kids tried to defend themselves from the crazy Hillbillies, who are actually a couple of sweet, harmless guys.

There are so many boring or awful or mean movies - that think humor involves degrading their characters - that this one is worth the five stars because it is, you know, kind of nice.

Nice does not mean that there are not gross-out scenes in the movie. There is no bad language or nudity, but if you are squeamish about simulated blood and body parts, you should go into this one forewarned.",1431993600,6,1181,4.658653846153846

I'm so glad I continued watching this movie. I feel this is one of the smartest horror movies to come out in a long time. I have told all of my friends about this. I won't spoil the move by explaining the plot. It has been done on so many other sites and in other reviews. Suffice it to say, this movies is not quite what you will be expecting.

There are the partying teenagers, the hot chick who wanders off in the woods, the usual suspects. But all of the characters have a unique twist to them, especially Tucker and Dale.

It's shallow - no, really shallow - but so are the slasher flicks it's sending up, so par for the course I guess. Problem is, Cabin in the Woods is already more comprehensive, Scream is wittier and Scary Movie is more profane, so there's not a lot of room to find a fresh niche. The titular duo have a good thing going, and the core script-flip of teens doing the terrorizing is fun in concept. There's just so little to it beyond the bare bones that it's hardly a filling meal, so the good laughs and splatter effects can't find enough meat to sink their teeth in. Mercifully short, it gets in and out in under eighty minutes, and even then seems a little bloated.",1420675200,,817,4.453333333333333

4700860,5,B005HI4LMS,"I don't say this very often, but just like with Cabin in the Woods, you'll enjoy Tucker and Dale vs Evil a lot more if you don't know anything at all going into it. For the last 4 years, the movie's been brought up by a couple of people I know when talking about some of their favorite comedies and horror movies. For some reason, I never got around to watching it until just the other night. I'd never seen a trailer, didn't read any reviews, and when people talked about it, they never really said much about the plot or anything. Man, this movie is one of the biggest surprises I've seen in a long time, and I haven't laughed out loud this much when watching a real comedy in ages. Tucker and Dale does everything right, and reminds me a lot of a movie like Shaun of the Dead where it's parodying a certain genre but still manages to be a legit film from the genre it's parodying.

The movie starts out with a bunch of typical college kids, driving around in the country. They're headed out to the woods to have some fun and stop by a local gas station to buy beer. They're way out in an area where everyone looks like they just walked off the set of Deliverance, and are getting a lot of weird looks from the locals. Two of these locals are Tucker and Dale. Dale is immediately taken by one of the girls, Allison, but he has an inferiority complex, and is very nervous to walk over and talk to her. Dale tells him to be friendly and laugh a lot. This doesn't work out for Dale, especially since he's holding a giant scythe when he's doing an awkward laugh. Needless to say, the kids hightail it outta there. Tucker and Dale head off too, to repair a vacation home Tucker got, and the kids just so happen to go out skinny dipping in the nearby river while the two are fishing. Allison falls and hits her head under water when she goes off alone, and Dale saves her. Her friends see the unconscious Allison slumped over Dale's shoulder as they yell ""WE GOT YOUR FRIEND!"" to notify them of the accident, but they don't see it as an innocent gesture, then make it their goal to get revenge on the hillbillies. To say that all ""hell breaks loose"" would be putting it lightly.

Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a story about analyzing the situation and finding out what's really going on, and it's even a plot point that one of the characters brings up once things go downhill for everyone. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprise, because so many jokes are sudden, or come back to something that's mentioned early on, like the cabin having a bunch of newspaper clippings from a murder that happened 20 years ago tacked up on one of the walls, along with a lot of bones. Everything is set up perfectly in advance. If you see something that could end up killing someone if they're not careful, chances are that it's going to happen, and it's not going to be pretty. Tucker and Dale, at first glance, seem like dumb rednecks, but they're both pretty intelligent and well-spoken, all things considered. Tucker would be the leader of the two, a little more educated than Dale, and a nice guy, while Dale is less confident in himself (as shown early on) and working on taking action and standing up for himself. He does this the hard way when the kids start attacking their home. I really loved everything about this movie, especially how the duo thought the kids were part of some suicide cult once they start getting themselves killed off. Each death is unexpected while still being predictable, if that makes any sense. One of them was so sudden that I actually burst out laughing and had to pause the movie for a few seconds. Everyone does a great job, acting-wise, with Tucker and Dale being guys you want to win, and most of the kids being so dumb or stuck-up that you want them to get taken out fast, especially their scrawny leader, with his popped-up collar.

The -only- negative thing I have to say isn't anything major, and it definitely doesn't affect the rating I'm giving it, is that most of the best stuff happens in the first half, and after that, it never reaches a point quite as great. The laughs are still there, the action's still there, just not quite as much as before. Still, the movie breezes by with the perfect runtime of an hour and a half, and there weren't any boring moments. This is one movie I could watch on a regular basis, like every couple of months, and not get tired of it.",1416700800,2,4396,4.365079365079365

I think a couple parts could have been done a little bit better as in leading up to the big 'surprise' when you see the direction this movie is all about but I may have been mislead slightly in the trailer. In the trailer it kind of hits you right in your face, the film lets you in on it a bit more gradually. But I'm being picky, I thought it was a good film and so I purchased it.

Dale and Tucker are just a couple of good old boys, heading out to their new ""vacation home"" to do some fishing, drinking and to clean up the cabin and the property. On the way to the cabin, they pass a group of college kids heading out for a weekend of camping. They see the two rednecks, and immediately think they backwoods murders. It doesn't help that when the two groups meet up again at a small store, Dale tries to introduce himself to one of the girls, and following Tucker's advice, convinces the college kids that their first impression is the correct one. When Tucker and Dale run into the group a third time, things really go haywire, and the college kids decide to kill Dale and Tucker.

Funny and twisted, Tyler Labine is hilarious!! This is a comedy made for horror fans, and plays off the tropes of so many backwoods thrillers, you can't wait to see what happens next.",1413504000,,1094,4.384236453201971

Tucker buys his vacation home (scene of a murder years prior). Tucker and Dale go to fix it up and fish. Enroute, college kids pass Tucker and Dale. Among the kids, Dale sees the most beautiful woman he's ever seen and falls in love. At the gas station, Dale tries to talk to her, but the kids misinterpret his awkwardness.

That night, Tucker and Dale go boat fishing. Dale's dream girl goes skinny dipping, but slips, falls, and knocks herself unconscious. Tucker and Dale paddle over and rescue the girl, but the kids (who obviously watched too many slasher movies) think T&D hurt her.

The kids plot their revenge while T&D remain blissfully unaware that anything's wrong  or that Tucker & Dale are now in mortal danger.

4701046,4,B005HI4LMS,"Crawling out of the creepy Canadian mind of director/co-writer Eli Craig, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil takes its cues from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and a few others of similar ilk. It parodies tropes from slasher cinema, most notably The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, Deliverance, and, uh, The Dukes of Hazzard (okay, maybe not the last one). And because it clings to a certain daft logic, the comedy isn't mindless. There's an actual, um, stab at storytellng.

Tucker & Dale vs. Evil subverts the classic premise. Here come those college kids up for some fun at the lake up in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Enroute, they realize that no one had packed the beer, and so there's the booze stop at the gas station. There, the kids are alarmed when they run into two suspicious backwoods types, Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine). Beneath the big laughs there's an enduring life lesson imparted, the one about not judgin' a book by its cover. In fact, these two rustic homeboys are who we end up rooting for.

Ol' Leatherface must've listed his remote cabin in the woods on zillow or on realtor.com because the crib that Tucker purchased as his vacation home by the lake, it sure looks familiar. He'd brung his best bud Dale along to share the good times of lake fishing and pickled egg munchin' and beer guzzling and also renovating a hell of a fixer-upper of a cabin. To facilitate the restoration, there's the wood chipper and the chainsaw, but I'm positive we won't see those again. Tucker and Dale arrive and eyeball the human bones strewn up all over the place, and Tucker observes: ""Whoever used to live here must've been an archaeologist or somethin'."" Heh.

This and that happens, and soon the college kids are convinced the two hillbillies are out to murderize them and do barbaric stuff to their human skins and such. It's a comedy of horrors and severe misunderstandings and skewed perspectives as the kids decide to take the fight to the hillbillies. Eli Craig is obviously well caught up on his slasher film history, and I appreciate his fresh and even inspired approach to sending up a very tired sub-genre. Scenes of a terrorized Tucker and Dale fleeing a group of homicidal teens generate some really good comedy. You'd just have to buy the recurring conceit of people inadvertently coming to a gristly end around Tucker and Dale (thru no fault of their own), the fallout to this being that our southern boys end up looking more and more guilty in the eyes of the college kids. Dale and Tucker's reactions to these horrific deaths are very funny. A very concerned Tucker, at one point, tells the surviving teens (who Tucker and Dale begin to believe have a weird suicide pact going): ""I know you kids are having fun, but I am NOT a thrill-seeker.""

Alan Tudyk is understated, considering. Tyler Labine has the more showy part. They make for two likable good old boys, and they carry the film. Labine is particularly loveable as the sweet teddy bear of a guy who suffers from crippling inferiority complex, never mind that he's got a photographic memory. Their friendship provides the heart of the story. As for the college kids, they're all seriously unsympathetic, with one exception. That gang also seems infested with one supreme d0uchebag of a dude who was the most psyched about hunting down hillbillies. The one exception is the sweet farm girl Allison (Katrina Bowden) who unintentionally triggers the sweeping bloodbath.

Like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, this movie toes the line between send-up and storytelling. It packs in the laughs while making you invest in Tucker and Dale and Allison. This movie was a real surprise for me. I wasn't expecting much of it. Maybe I'd seen too many Larry the Cable Guy shows that left me stone-faced. If you're the sort of person who laughs uncontrollably when someone onscreen has a gory death, well, don't sit next to me, pal. But the way the deaths go down in this one, they're meant to be shocking AND funny. Hell, yes, I recommend this movie.",1406764800,,4041,4.718130311614731

The film falls apart a bit at the end, but by the time the inevitable (unavoidable) final conflict unfolds, the movie already has paid for itself in dark humor.  Less campy than say ""Army of Darkness"" but not quite as polished as ""Bubba Ho-Tep,"" this is a solid movie that may evolve into a cult classic.",1403481600,,475,4.9125

4701097,5,B005HI4LMS,"The first time I watched this movie was home alone one night.  I rarely laugh at funny movies when I watch alone, but this movie is so ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh.  A while later I was with some friends and we were looking for a movie to watch.  We were flipping through the Prime catalog and I recommended this.  We usually play card/board games and watch movies simultaneously.  About 10 minutes into the movie, everyone had dropped their Cards Against Humanity cards and were focusing on the movie.  A week later, I was with the same group of friends plus another 2 who had not seen it, and we started talking about the movie and eventually watched it again.  This never happens.

I really can't say enough good things about this movie.  I won't spoil the plot because trying to describe it would inevitably lead to spoilers, like Cabin in the Woods (but I think Tucker & Dale vs Evil is slightly better).  If you have any knowledge of the horror genre and don't mind gore, I have no doubt that you will love this movie.  It takes such a familiar movie trope and flips it upside down to make it fun again.

The misunderstandings and miscommunications lead to some extremely funny and creative deaths. My teenage sons wondered why I got them such a stupid movie. Then they watched it.

I did like this movie, although there is a lot of gore, it has a comic book or cartoon quality that seems more funny than gross.

4701149,5,B005HI4LMS,"This has quickly become one of my favorite movies. It's such a fun original concept taking the point of view of the ""hillbillies"" instead of the kids. It was fun, entertaining, had me and my friends all laughing quite a lot",1398038400,,223,4.463414634146342

Two lovable West Virginian hillbillies, are headed to their ""fixer-upper"" vacation cabin to drink some beer, do some fishin', and have a good time. But when they run into a group of preppy college kids who assume from their looks that they must be in-bred, chainsaw wielding killers, Tucker & Dale's vacation takes a bloody & hilarious turn for the worse.

Review - 5/5
Just a heads up, this isn't really horror. No zombies, monsters, vampires, or anything else. So if you're looking for that kind of movie move along. However if you want some deadpan comedy, you came to the right place. A fun, bloody good time! It's like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/B001EBYM7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>&nbsp;on acid. And a hot piece of tail as one of the leads. Thankfully it's not a complete sausage fest. The film isn't cheaply made and the story I got a good kick out of. Even my girlfriend loved it and found it funny. She even said she would watch it again and she hardly ever rewatches anything. Be warned this is not for children. Lot's of curse words and violence. But comedy doesn't seemed forced and the two actors playing bumbling rednecks are awesome.",1396742400,,1240,5.2
4701159,4,B005HI4LMS,"This movie had some cheesy parts, but that's what made this movie so funny.  If you like the Scary Movie(s), you will like this one too.",1396742400,,136,4.230769230769231

4701163,5,B005HI4LMS,Hilarious. Definitely not for young children. The two protagonists are mistakenly believed to be serial killers by a group of college students. Throw in a secluded lake and a run down cabin and let the hilarity begin. A lot of blood and gore and over the top accidents. I wished I had seen this movie in the theater. Enjoy.,1396656000,,323,4.491525423728813

Two good natured country boys accidentally become the antagonists in a slasher flick thanks to the cultural misconceptions of some teenagers on a road trip. It is subtle, funny and well acted. I am so glad I own this now.",1395360000,,254,4.425531914893617
4701179,5,B005HI4LMS,It was so funny I loved it. I laughed so hard that I could not hardly breathe. It also is an example of people judging people for there looks or what they wear it has great story line and one of the best movies I have seen on my prime membership.,1395273600,,246,3.843137254901961
4701180,5,B005HI4LMS,Very funny movie. A different view than most horror type movies. Laughed very hard to the point of crying in several spots.,1395187200,,123,4.636363636363637

4701184,5,B005HI4LMS,"I'm not really a fan of the slasher flick genre. I LOVE this movie. It has me in stitches every single time.
If you like movies like Shaun of the Dead, you'll like this one.",1394928000,,173,3.9714285714285715
4701185,5,B005HI4LMS,This movie is just incredible. Surprisingly original. Dialog is hilarious and death scenes are outrageous. I laughed more than I should have.,1394928000,,141,5.454545454545454
4701186,3,B005HI4LMS,"There were a few funny moments in this flick, and thankfully it wasn't over the top gory. But for the most part it was dull and OMG the horribly stupid cliched ending really ruined a halfway decent flick. Sorry, but the young hot psychology student never falls in love with the unbathed overweight redneck. I watched it based on the reviews, and I'm left wondering if we watched the same movie.",1394668800,,394,4.563380281690141
4701187,5,B005HI4LMS,"Seriously funny! It sounds like it wouldn't be worth it but it really is. If your a horror movie buff, you'll think this is the best horror comedy.. Give it a shot. You won't be sorry.",1394668800,,184,4.138888888888889

4701194,5,B005HI4LMS,"Probably one of my top 10 favorite movies. It's very gory, but also hilarious, and has a surprising amount of heart. If you are a horror fan with a sense of humor, or just like a good comedy and don't mind some blood, give it a go.",1394323200,,231,3.9361702127659575
4701195,4,B005HI4LMS,Shows you the reason you should not judge based upon a stereotype. Very clever. I always like Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine. Plus I liked the supporting actress.,1394236800,,159,4.714285714285714

4701197,5,B005HI4LMS,"I like how, FINALLY, the twist is so far off the common path. So many movies following the same genre, start and end the same, this one does not. If your wanting a chuckle i would definitely watch this movie.",1394150400,,208,4.225
4701198,3,B005HI4LMS,"It starts slow but the bodies do pile up eventually. There are a few bright moments to enjoy. Impalements, falling into wood chippers,

4701201,5,B005HI4LMS,Was a very funny movie...very gory but overall funny.  Cast was good plot was funny one of my favorite movies!!!!,1393891200,,113,4.65

4701203,5,B005HI4LMS,Nice spin on the usual slasher film tropes.  My wife and I saw it and thought it was hilarious.  Got this copy for my redneck brother's birthday.  I'm sure he will love it too.,1393459200,,176,4.117647058823529
4701204,5,B005HI4LMS,Starts out slow but gets crazy shortly after. It's quite bloody but it is a comedy. I loved it as much as my friends who urged me to see it. Glad i did. Good entertainment ha ha,1393286400,,177,3.810810810810811
4701205,5,B005HI4LMS,"I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking ""That looks like a good time"" and sure enough, the trailer didn't do this movie wrong, it was a good time (heck, still is)  Now you might think, what sicko thinks gore is a good time and I would probably say no one for real, but when it is in a comedy/horror flick it comes on screen you have to say Ewww, oh god and follow it with a good laugh.

The two poor hillbillys got themselves a vacation home that looks like something out of a horror movie and though there is a few faulty parts that would kill any co-ed student it misses them and just adds one more thing to fix on their list of things to do.  They pull off that good natured country bumpkin so well when the co-eds do show up you sort of feel bad for them having their vacation ruined by their unwelcome presence.  Though there are parts that feel like any other movie of this genre the fact you are seeing it from the other side makes is funny as all get out.

I have suggested this movie to many others and they too have gotten a kick out of it. If you like horror movies with a comedy twist this will tickle your funny bone as well as make you a bit squirmy.",1393286400,,1176,4.051724137931035

4701210,5,B005HI4LMS,Although this is really a comedy - in terms of entertainment value it was very high.  My husband and I laughed through the whole movie.,1392940800,,135,4.4

4701212,5,B005HI4LMS,"Just a silly, funny movie that just makes you laugh, sometimes you don't even know why because it is so goofy.  If you like Harold & Kumar go to White Castle, Dumb & Dumber, Dude where's my car, well then you will bust a gut watching Dale & Tucker Vs Evil.",1392854400,,256,4.019607843137255
4701213,5,B005HI4LMS,"If you have a single satrical bone in your body, this movie is a must see.  It is a great twist of the slasher, Deliverance style movies where the Hillbillys are the bad guys and the innocent college kids are the victims.  Interestingly it also touches on something that is very true, that is, rural folks who live simple lives are often discriminated against by more ""sophisticated"" urbanites in literature, TV, movies, etc. while they are simply trying to lead enjoyable and fufilling lives themselves.  Fun show with a healthy, overdue message.",1392854400,,547,4.923913043478261

4701218,4,B005HI4LMS,I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did. Although it is dark humor it is a fresh punch in the face funny film. Enjoy,1392681600,,129,3.4827586206896552
4701219,4,B005HI4LMS,Surprisingly Funny. Kind of like Texas Chainsaw meets Larry the Cable Guy & Friends. A little slow to start but worth it,1392681600,,120,4.5
4701220,5,B005HI4LMS,"I thought this was another bad straight to video movie, but kept hearing good things about it. I was pleasantly surprised.

4701224,5,B005HI4LMS,this has to be the funniest low budget film I have seen in forever I laughed so hard I cried almost the entire time definitely worth watching,1392422400,,141,4.2592592592592595

4701228,4,B005HI4LMS,This movie is a scream; I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as good as it is. It pokes fun at college kid slasher flick tropes and manages to have a heart. Good stuff!,1392336000,,166,3.911764705882353
4701229,5,B005HI4LMS,If you love horror movies you will love this movies. Hilarious and plays off of every cliche. This movies does a good job of keeping it away from the slapstick comedy of the Wayans brothers.,1392336000,,190,4.457142857142857

It's basically a spoof of movies like Wrong Turn or The Hills Have Eyes but not in a ""Scary Movie"" fashion, it's actually nothing like that - it has it's own story going on in the process.

Sets Hillbillies back 50 years, but DUCK DYNASTY does more harm to them then this film ever will and they are fake hillbillies to boot.",1391040000,,397,4.102564102564102

HOWEVER, what could have been just another flat, mundane and pointless horror comedy, turned out to be one of the funniest misunderstanding films ever made, thanks to the brilliant performances by Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk.. Brilliantly constructed and the timing was perfect. I laughed all the way through. Best part is, that it's not a huge big studio overly-test screened and chipped down to the best consumer marketed version for profits.

This film was a nice surprise. I streamed it on Prime, and now I'm buying the Blu Ray and can't wait to see the extras and listen to the commentary.

Although, I do feel I must take exception with one person who compared this with the style of Sam Rami..and I couldn't disagree more..Sam Rami only wishes he had this kind of skill for timing. I do respect Rami and love the Evil Dead films, but this film isn't at all like those. In many respects, it's way better.  :)",1391040000,,1038,4.6923076923076925

A friend gave this to my husband and I for Christmas and when it started I was a bit surprised knowing our friends have similar likes and interests.  Too funny!  A great spoof movie.  Every story has two sides and this one presents the side of the two ""psycho"" killers.  Wonderful family fun.  Similar to the Monty Python in the gore category.

But rather a fresh twist in a parody of films like wrong turn (because it's the exact opposite.)  Plenty of funny twists, especially my favorite, the chainsaw scene.

I think it's safe to say that you can closely relate this to a spoof movie such as, Not another scary movie. It is a bit gory...well not enough blood and guts for the zombie lover in me. I highly recommend for you NOT to let your younger kids see this if they don't like blood, guts, and scary sounding music. The reason I say this is because I saw that some parents have made the mistake of letting their kids watch this movie and giving the movie a bad review because little Susie could not handle a little bit of blood.

Though the overall pace of the movie picks up, and almost speeds out of control, it keeps a steady and reasonable pace.

It serves that purpose, but it's more a lampoon at all the stereotypical 'horror' tropes and should be labeled as a straight up gore comedy. It had me in stitches. I frequently had to pause the movie because I was laughing so hard I couldn't hear the dialogue. If you're looking for highbrow suspense .. this is not it. If you're looking for a fun movie, this fits the bill. It's quite a clever lampoon. I really, really can't say more without spoilers.",1387065600,,541,4.474747474747475

Terribly funny parody. The kind of bloody that makes you laugh. Worth the watch.

What you can expect us to watch an R rated movie based on blood and gore. It is a dark comedy that had us laughing more and more as the plot progressed.

I see that it made a lot of people laugh, but I was not one of those people. The jokes and gore came in at once after the first hour of boredom, leaving me about 30 min of laughs between the set up and the hugging-and-learning type ending. This was more like a weaker version of Pig Hunt, which I was not crazy about in the first place, but if you like this then you should like Pig Hunt, though it's not as funny and it has more gore.

In this case, it takes the classic model of ""crazy hillbilly killers in the wild"" and completely turns it on its head, with side-splitting results. The titular Tucker and Dale are two good old boys looking to enjoy a weekend fishing and fixing up their new cabin they purchased (a fixer-upper, to put it lightly). They can be a bit dim-witted in some regards, and are simple people from simple backgrounds, but they are also good, honest, hardworking individuals who value the friendship they share and are extremely likable. Meanwhile, some college kids happen to also be camping nearby, who are rather full of themselves and disdainful (and fearful) of hillbilly types. When an accident at a lake at night results in our two heroes saving a young woman from the college kids' group, it sets off a series of events that first convinces the girls' ""friends"" that she has been kidnapped. Following a botched rescue attempt, the clueless kids become convinced our pair are just a bunch of deranged killers, even though it's entirely the dumb kids accidentally killing themselves! Things just escalate and get out of hand from there. It's great fun watching all the ways the kids manage to kill themselves, and manage to convince themselves it's the fault of the rednecks. It reverses what you'd expect about who is the hero and who is the villain, as well as who is smart and who is dumb.",1377993600,,1435,4.767068273092369
4701386,2,B005HI4LMS,"""After watching one of 2012's best films so far, The Cabin in the Woods, and previous types like Shaun of the Dead, The Evil Dead, and ParaNorman this came not of much a surprise as it were moreover another foundation into the horror pastiche/cult film experience.

First and foremost, knowing that it was a Canadian spoof would only conjure up images of 'huh?' but Tucker & Dale works pretty well for the most part like a well-done college film. The special effects, dialogue, and length of time aren't all that stellar but you don't need to take that into consideration for a film like this. To some, it maybe perfect and pretty ""out-there"", in a good way, when you watch it without thinking about it.

The twist of the genre with the college kids causing havoc and the leader's paranoia only manifests a higher splurge of laughter and intrigue into how will thinks go. The climax, cheesy/nonsense attitude, and the subtlety in its humour and use of irony, that follow on the same vein as The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episodes or an [adult swim] 10-minute sketch, are alright here and making you on the edge of the seat at times knowing what will happen to Dale when he meets a klutzy girl. It does skim over a few parts due to its short length and some of the dialogues between T&D do go a little more than necessary.

Don't expect, just like Cabin in the Woods or Prometheus for that matter, when you go into the film because that in the end will determine whether you like this or not!""",1377820800,2,1496,4.512915129151292

This is a nice roll reversal with the characters.  The college kids are not the good guys and the HIllbillies are just flat out good hearted and honest.  My wife wasn't sure about watching this movie at first but she quickly got into it and enjoyed it.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again and find yourself laughing ahead of the funny scenes since you know what is to come.  Well worth buying.,1374969600,,693,4.088888888888889

We were laughing so hard that we tracked down a copy of the movie that very night.  Then, we huddled in front of the screen and giggled, guffawed and snortled our way through this movie like a couple of goofy kids.  We even had to pause the movie a few times because we were laughing so hard.

The horror genre has long since lost its charm for us, so this movie really made our night (okay - it made our whole week!)  It's clever without being too cute for it's own good and even the gory parts (which we usually don't have patience for) were forgivable.  It's a very well thought-out movie and excellently executed - um ... pun not intended ;-)  There was great attention in even the smallest details and we paused often to take it all in: newspaper clippings in the background, opposing characters dressed in outfits that were subtly similar, etc.  I highly recommend this movie for both horror fans and those who have ""out-grown"" the genre.",1373846400,,1101,4.410891089108911

4701406,4,B005HI4LMS,"For plot synopsis, see the product description...

Tucker and Dalve vs. Evil is a fun little horror movie that pokes fun at and pays homage to the gernre at the same time similar to Behind The Mask, and Cabin In The Woods. (These 3 films would make for a great triple feature.). The film zips along at a good pace, and the laughs are constant, and when the pretty girl falls in love with the loveable Dale it feels genuine.

The kills in this movie are played mostly for laughs, often relying too much on CG for the execution. This is my only gripe with the film, the cartoony looking kills sometimes take you out of the experience, becaue they look so fake (Especially the weed-whacker one.), but it doesn't bother me too much, because of the comedic tone set up by the film makers. But it does keep this movie from getting 5 stars from me.

There is also a surprisingly good message in the film about not judging people based on there looks, perhaps I've looked too deeply into the film, but the idea of not communicating and misunderstandings is front and center.

For the most part the acting is great, the main characters are believable, some of the college kids are hit or miss, but luckily the less talented actors get killed off.

The premise: two ""backwoods"" guys decide to go camping and all hell breaks loose when they cross paths with a group of young people near their cabin. There are no bad guys - it's not that type of film (i.e. it's not a slasher flick). but it's got plenty of bloodshed, much of it quite funny.

4701427,4,B005HI4LMS,"Call me crazy, call me corny... but I have fallen head over heels for this exuberant little bluegrass comedy thriller.

Two endearingly dumb hick hillbillies, Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk), are happily settling in for a vacation at their ramshackle cabin in the woods when their bliss is disrupted by the arrival of a carload of mindless college kids.

During a late-night fishing excursion, the beer-loving buddies witness a swimming party and rescue one of the girls from drowning, taking her back to their cabin to recover.

While Tucker spends his day working in the woods, Dale devotes every moment to humbly caring for their unexpected guest. Nice, pretty, intelligent and bland Allison (Katrina Bowdan) quickly loses her initial fear of her bearded, beer-bellied Bear of a host as she discovers him to be awkwardly shy, gentle, sweet-natured and seriously cute. In turn, the self-negating Dale is overwhelmed by the acceptance and warmth of this unattainable dream person. The two develop an unlikely friendship and cozily settle down to await the return of her friends.

This is not how Allison's friends perceive the situation. They have been frightened by tales of bloodthirsty killers in the area and are certain that ""Final Girl"" Allison has been captured by savage rednecks. In their zeal to rescue her, they each rush to the attack - and accidentally cause their own violent, bloody deaths in the best FRIDAY THE 13th manner.

TUCKER AND DALE vs. EVIL, like the classic ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), is that rarity: a Horror-Comedy that honors the genre and works on every level. It can be seen as the Laurel and Hardy version of such rural thrillers as DELIVERANCE and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. In this case the humor is restrained and character-oriented, and all physical comedy stems directly from the situation.

The film's admirable achievement is that it maintains a buoyant sense of humor without ever mocking or compromising genre conventions. The point of view of the two groups of characters determines the alternating shifts of tone. The good ol' boys and their open-minded girl friend see the story as a rustic romantic comedy whereas the shallow college kids exist in a generic slasher-flick dimension, played straight with menacing music and every edge-of-seat beat in place. Whenever the two worlds happen to meet, the resulting absurdity twists the standard blood'n'guts ""Kills"" as a dynamic unity of shock and laughter. The deft balancing of this sharp contrast is the key to TUCKER AND DALE's success.

Central to the movie's charm are the appealing performances of the three leads; especially big -- and big-hearted -- Tyler Labine, whose personal warmth and good-humor make this a splatter with soul.

Add to this a genuinely warm and moving story of love and friendship between characters we come to care for, and you have a one-of-a-kind indie winner to treasure and remember.

And, oh yeah -- it's awesome on eye-poppin' Blu-Ray, sporting an uproarious commentary track by Labine and Tudyk with director Eli Craig, and a short version of the film re-edited to portray The Boys as REAL mountain maniacs.

4701454,3,B005HI4LMS,"This film was only mildly entertaining, which I felt was lousy because I had such high hopes. Essentially, minus the British accents, this movie is like ""Mr Bean with a chainsaw.""
This movie failed on so many levels, but mostly because it was clearly playing to the lowest possible denominator. This is obvious in the way all the possible stereotypes of the characters in this movie were displayed.
Dumb luck also plays an important part in this movie. I know that it's a movie, and since it's just a movie, I should willfully suspend disbelief, but I can't help it. Just like ""I am who I am"", ""a substantially mediocre film is a substantially mediocre film.""",1365724800,,659,4.689655172413793

This is written well also. Seriously, insert big name actor here and this movie is well known. Its funny, scarey and suspenseful. Its funnier every time you watch it.

4701459,5,B005HI4LMS,"I absolutely loved this very dark comedy and I found it even better than ""Shawn of the dead"". Below you will find more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS included.

Tucker and Dale are uneducated but hard working blue-collar people living in a backward area of West Virginia. Best friends since always and best friends forever, they are of course very different - Tucker is more assuming, better spoken, more handsome (or less ugly if you prefer) and somehow more succesful, when Dale is shy, complexed, overweight and in his own opinion a total looser.

The story begins the day when the two friends decide to go on a vacation, to work on a ""vacation home"" Tucker just bought, which is situated in the wild woods, near a lake. The ""vacation home"" is in fact an abandoned, dilapidated ruin, surrounded on every side by a vegetation gone completely wild. But Tucker and Dale never feared hard work and they are very enthusiastic about the task which awaits them - and they also expect to spend some really good time drinking beer, fishing, drinking beer, playing board games and drinking beer.

But there is also a second group of people who came to spend some summer time on the other shore of the lake - they are college students, six guys and three gorgeous girls. One girl in particular will play an important role - her name is Allison (Katrina Bowden) and she is an incredibly beautiful and sexy creature (think about young Denise Richards and you will have an idea).

And then, as it is this kind of film, there is also, unavoidably, EVIL, which in this film comes mostly from misunderstandings, stupidity and prejudices, but is greatly amplified by a growing insanity which affects one of the characters.

The confrontation between the two likeable hillbillies, the nine college kids and the EVIL produces a wonderful, albeit by moments very gory and pretty cruel, comedy. This film is so filled with incredible dialogs, memorable one-liners, great slap-stick scenes and other delights, that at the end I could hardly believe that it lasted only 85 minutes! And from the first minutes to the very end I laughed so hard that tears were flowing from my eyes and my ribs were hurting. I was laughing like a hysterically drunk hyena who is fighting madness and loosing - in fact at one moment my wife and daughters panicked and came running to check on me because they thought I was dying!

Although it is not absolutely necessary to enjoy this film, it can be useful to remind yourself the (in)famous ""Deliverance"" movie. If you never saw it, try at least to read the synopsis and try to find on the web THE scene from the film, the one with Ned Beatty and the two hillbillies... You may also want to rewatch the first of ""Friday the 13th"" films and have at least a look at the trailer of ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". But once again, this is not absolutely necessary.

I loved this film, I am very happy that I bought it and this DVD is definitely a keeper. Enjoy!",1364947200,,2978,4.628787878787879
4701460,5,B005HI4LMS,"This movie is hilarious.  The dialog between Tucker and Dale is great, the situation is not so absurd that you can't see it happening.  This is the route the ""Scary Movie"" series should have taken.  If you like unusual (and slightly dark) comedies this is one to check out.",1364860800,,273,4.530612244897959
4701461,5,B005HI4LMS,"I saw this movie mentioned in a review of great movies done wrong by box office success, and since I'm a huge Alan Tudyk fan, I figured I'd give it a shot. Loved it! It's a very funny movie with an interesting plot. I couldn't believe a gory comedy slasher flick could've even been mentioned as a go see flick for a critic, then I learned why. Watch it, it's funny. I will give no details in giving away its genius. Tudyk is brilliant as always. Very pleased.",1364860800,,459,4.2272727272727275
4701462,5,B005HI4LMS,"""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" takes the redneck backwoods horror premise and spins it on its grizzled head.  Tucker and Dale are a couple of well-meaning rednecks on their way into the deep woods to hang out at their ramshackle vacation home together.  A group of preppy-type college kids see them at a local convenience store and assume that they are a couple of redneck maniacs out to get them.  Things get even worse when one of the good 'ole boys decides to approach one of the sorority sisters and ask her out on a date.  He's extremely nervous and awkward and comes off as pretty creepy so this only fortifies the college kids' assumptions about the redneck buddies.  This is the beginning of a collision course between the well-meaning good 'ole boys and their preppy nemeses who assume nothing but the worst about them.  This  movie is hilarious with lots of crazy splatter effects as the college kids are killed off one-by-one.  In just about every case the college kids' deaths are caused by their own stupidity.  Despite all its goofiness the film has a message about the importance of not judging a book by its cover.  In less talented hands, the movie could have just come off as just stupid instead of a movie with a brain and a heart.",1364688000,,1244,4.563063063063063

4701465,4,B005HI4LMS,"Another semi horror spoof. A friend of mine told me about this movie and said it was a must see. I will admit, there are parts that are very funny.  I think the typical hillbilly in the woods, stranded teenagers motif says it all. If you want silly humor mixed with 80's slasher flick blood and guts this ones for you.",1363910400,,318,4.213114754098361
4701466,2,B005HI4LMS,"I don't know why this movie got such great reviews.  I think even Leonard Maltin gave it a ***1/2 review!  What's that about?  Sure, the movie was pretty funny, but it's never quite as clever as it wants to be.  Also, the balance of comedy and horror leans too far to the comedy side.  Comedy and horror are incredibly difficult genres to balance together.  Some examples of really good ones I can think of are ""Return of the Living Dead,"" ""Ravenous,"" and ""Shaun of the Dead.""  These films were all grounded in a sort of violent reality whereas Tucker & Dale requires some major suspension of disbelief if you're going to go along with the horror element.  The idea behind the film is a clever one, I'll definitely give it that.  The leads are very likable and the setting very comfortably familiar (as far as horror movies go).  But, like I said, I felt that the comedy outweighed the horror and that the movie was a little too goofy to warrant a great review.  I guess I'm trying to say that, as a horror fan, I found the movie too cartoonish.  I think that's the word I'm looking for.  Anyway, I've only seen it once and movies like Tucker & Dale tend to come across better for me the second time around, when I know what to expect.  I'll give it another watch on its own merits, and maybe I'll like it more.",1363824000,2,1311,4.341563786008231

Though bumbling and largely uninformed, they're well balanced by large quantities of humor, charm, and loyalty.

I really enjoyed the ""spin"" that this movie puts on the classic ""college kid horror flick"", spoofing on many of the conventions of the old, tired genre. Oftentimes, it's hilarious. Yet, there was something off about the pacing, which prevented me from getting into the movie full swing. It just couldn't hold my attention. I had to watch it in 20-30 minute spurts, and then come back to it several days later, until I finally finished it.

Everything from the screenplay, direction to the cast performances are fantastically executed. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk, wow! the presence of these two are just enough to draw you to the entire story, everything from their chemistry to their interactions are so believable that you really care for them throughout the film.

It allows me to laugh at what reminds me of ""One of my own neighbors"" without being offended. I think folks are to easily offended any more any way but that's just me.

4701505,5,B005HI4LMS,"I just want to make it clear that I am NOT a horror movie fan. At all. They don't do anything for me. Probably, it's the lack of any real story in them, because, really, what kind of story do you need for a guy to go around killing people in the most gruesome ways possible? And, then, there's the gore, which is not something I need in my life. I mean, I went to see Punisher: Warzone (at the theater!), and that may have scarred me for life. Of course, that may as well have been a horror movie considering the lack of story and the excessive gore. I can count on one hand the number of horror movies that I've seen and thought they were pretty good: Halloween (the very first one, which I saw when I was a kid (I'm pretty sure it was an edited for TV version) over at a friend's house) and April Fool's Day (which I didn't want to watch, but I was kind of stuck at a party, so it was either watch the movie or go sit in a room by myself), which is worth it  for the ending. Okay, so that didn't even take a hand.

That being said, I love Alan Tudyk. Even before Firefly, I thought he was awesome as Steve the Pirate in Dodgeball, and that's where I recognized him from when we finally watched Firefly. Besides, how can you not love a guy that was in Spamalot? As Lancelot, no less, the Cleese character in Holy Grail (or one of them, anyway). So I was really torn when I saw he was in Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, but what a great title, right?

I'm glad I finally broke down and watched it. Yeah, yeah, it has plenty of gore, but it's not exactly the mindless gore of your typical horror/gorefest movie. I mean, in Tucker and Dale, you're busy being shocked or trying not to laugh while it's going on. Like when [spoiler] the ""stupid college kid"" throws himself into the wood chipper. Trying to laugh, or not to laugh, while being horrified is maybe not as easy as it sounds.

Alan Tudyk is, of course, awesome, but so is Tyler Labine as Dale. They have a great buddy chemistry going, but, really, the success of the film is rooted Labine's performance as the best friend and the romantic lead as he chases after Katrina Bowden (from 30 Rock) as Allison, who is also quite good. Jesse Moss pulls off the preppy jerk and could have walked right out of any number of 80's flicks.

The true genius of the film is that it takes the idea of a ""comedy of errors"" and mixes it up flawlessly with the horror genre. It makes me wonder why no one else has ever done this. Or maybe they have, and I just never heard of it, but I'm more inclined to think this kind of thing hasn't been done before. All of the classic horror movie pieces are there: group of college kids going off into the woods, spooky warning from a creepy cop about how ""you shouldn't go there,"" and a ""ghost"" story as a backdrop. Really, I was all set up for the typical horror movie and wasn't actually sure I'd watch the whole thing, even with Tudyk in it.

But you can tell there's something else going on from the beginning, you're just not quite sure what it is.",1359849600,,3027,4.165811965811966

4701508,4,B005HI4LMS,"Two simpleminded hillbillies head for the mountains to fix up their new vacation home, a dilapidated cabin, when they fall under attack by a group of college kids that have mistaken them for psychotic serial killers! Move over, Jason, Horror has a new mascot... Two actually, in TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL! Eli Craig's brilliant satire of the Slasher genre has all of the same sharply-written humor as SCREAM minus the pretentious overtures, turning Horror on its head by playing off of every major movie trope with hilarious results. Simple misunderstandings give off sinister appearances, as the college kids confuse Tucker and Dale's good-natured acts as attempts to kill them! When one of the girls slips on a rock, Dale heroically saves her from the lake, but the teens only see an unconscious body being dragged from the water! As they attempt to rescue her, Tucker accidentally saws into a beehive, and comes charging into the woods with a chainsaw, causing one of the kids to impale himself on a tree branch! Bits like this only cover half of the humor, because the real smarts come out in Craig's witty dialog. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk downplay their roles for maximum effect, providing plenty of laughs and keen comedic timing along the way. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is bloody good fun from start to finish, earning its place right beside other modern revisionist classics like BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON and LONG PIGS!

4701530,4,B005HI4LMS,"Is it any good?

Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a satirical horror/comedy that from start to finish never has any intention of ever taking itself seriously, and in saying, should be viewed that way. In the same vein of `Shaun of the Dead', Tucker & Dale takes all the cliches from the in-bred hillbilly teen slasher flicks switches it up and manages to create a new genre; the accidental slasher film. Tucker and Dale are best buds who just want to drink beer and go fishing down at their dilapidated cabin; sure they're hillbillies but not the `Deliverence' type hillbillies that a bunch of pretentious and extremely prejudice college kids make them out to be. As the story unfolds we witness total misunderstanding through complete idiocy which results in plenty of gruesomely hilarious death scenes. It's easy to see that Tucker & Dale probably wouldn't have worked without the right casting, thankfully Labine and Tudyk work well together and are clearly having a lot of fun. Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a good gory fun redneck slasher horror with no fear of man rape just good clean hilarity; check it out.

4701577,5,B005HI4LMS,"It's either a horror movie masquerading as a comedy, or a comedy masquerading as a horror movie.

Other reviews will fill you in better on the way certain horror movie cliches are basically ""stood on their head"" (and that would include the most frightening horror movie of all time, Boorman's ""Deliverance"") but we might as well be specific because this movie looks like an allegory of contemporary America. You see, one of the biggest cliches in American popular culture is the cliche about rural society, either homespun dumb, closed-minded (read racist) or in the case of horror films just plain inbred and psychopathically violent. These images did not start with horror films, horror films just sort of take these images to extremes. ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" were a cute version of this prejudice against rural folk, ""Honey Boo Boo"" is the latest ""reality TV"" version. Some people have blamed ""liberal media"" but it is probably just a rural society created by city people who got sick of living close to nature in the countryside. Or they are embarrassed by their own relatives.

""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" takes the urban constructed Hillbilly and puts him on his head to create a very clever but caring film that is funny as hell and filled with lots of blood. But almost every death is the result of the ignorance of the ""college kids"" (I mean who would dive at a wood chipper?) I have not laughed so hard at any movie for a long time.

For Tucker and Dale life revolves around beer, fishing and hanging out.  Not the sharpest knife in the drawer or troubled by complex thoughts, they enjoy a simple life.
This weekend, at the ""summer home"", they plan to drink beer, fish and do some repair work.

The college kids are going camping in the woods.  They plan to drink beer, smoke some grass and skinny dip.
This is their break away from the pressure of college.

Both groups stop at a country store and things go downhill from there.

This is a spoof on every mad killer in the woods film ever made.  You can see the jokes a mile away but they are still funny.
Tucker and Dale work as the hillbillies, with no false notes.  Most of the college kids only have to die.

4701611,4,B005HI4LMS,"Tucker and Dale vs. Evil (Eli Craig, 2010)

Back in the day (in the dark ages of 1997) there was a ridiculously awesome TV series called Breaker High that pretty much no one watched. Among its cast of up-and-coming young-and-beautifuls were a pair of young actors who portrayed best pals Sean and Jimmy: Ryan Gosling and Tyler Labine. Three years later, Labine would be making high-profile Hollywood blockbusters like Antitrust, while Gosling had gone into the quirky-indie market with movies like The Believer. Fast-forward ten years... and somehow the roles have been reversed, with Gosling headlining everything from romantic melodramas (I man, crap, he was in a Nicholas Sparks movie ferfooxache) to neo-noir (Drive), while Labine, who's just as talented an actor, is now doing the indie thing. Ryan Gosling is in your face; you have to go looking for Tyler Labine. And here's the best example in recent memory of why you really, really want to.

Tucker (Beautiful Boy`s Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) are two blue-collar guys who are going on vacation for the first time in, well, ever; Tyler scored a great deal on a vacation property in the woods. Or so he thinks: it's actually the former residence of a crazed serial killer, and it's still replete with traps, tricks, and all other sorts of deadly hijinks. Still, the boys are determined to make the best of it, despite a bummer of a chance encounter with some college preppies at a dilapidated roadside gas station (a hilarious homage to at least fifty slasher flicks that have been released since The Texas Chain Saw Massacre). All goes well enough, with the boys managing to avoid getting themselves killed, until they run into the same college kids again while having a moonlight boat trip. One of the preppies, Allison (Piranha 3DDbeauty Katrina Bowden), slips from a rock and hits her head, so the boys bundle her into the boat and take her back to the cabin for medical attention, leading her friends to believe a couple of crazed serial killers have abducted their friend and launch a half-baked attempt to rescue her...with predictable results. From there, the comedy of errors gets funnier, and gorier, as the preps and assorted helpers from local law enforcement keep trying to rescue Allison--who's actually having quite a nice time bonding with Dale and playing board games--and running into the former occupant's traps or stumbling, sometimes quite literally, into fatal predicaments.

There's not much I can say about this other than that it succeeds on all counts, and it does so in the most smashing of ways. It's not only the funniest horror comedy I've seen since the eighties (yes, funnier than Dance of the Dead, Boy Eats Girl, and even Slither), it's the funniest comedy of any stripe I've seen since The Fisher King and Delicatessen back in the early nineties. Wonderful. ****",1351641600,,2857,4.9355509355509355

4701614,5,B005HI4LMS,"To set the record straight on this delightful B-flick, this is Eli Craig's debut that made it all the way to select premiers, including the ever-hard-to-aquire Sundance Film Festival. You don't have to be a fan of slasher flicks or even prescribe to the Predictably Cheesy genre either. Mr. Craig is an obvious fan of both types of films and pairs the main characters beautifully, who by their own rights have some chops in TV and film, Tyler Labine has the critically acclaimed Reaper to his credit and Alan Tudyk can respectably claim Firefly/Serenity.
  Eli Craig does a great job poking fun at the run of the mill but he does it respectably and humorously with plain old comedy, gore, and wit. The chemistry is good between the two friends, maybe a tad shaky on Katrina Bowden's part (thankfully she doesn't own the majority of the screen time), and is not what you'd expect from the low budget. You sci-fi fans will recognize a few of the other actors and also appreciate the twist put on this movie.
  It was a recommend on my Netflix account and I was a fan ten minutes in. Everyone I've referred this to loves it. There's just something endearing and well done about it. It won't help you decide who to vote for the in the next election but it will make you feel good that you watched it.

Tyler Labine and Jesse Moss did some really great work acting out two dynamic roles. The gentleness of one character versus the creepy evil of the other was the ideal contrast. This movie makes me laugh every time I see it. The lines are awesome. The setting and circumstances made for some really unusual action. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. You must watch it.
BTW, I am a redneck with hillbilly family. I love them and I love this movie because it shows how people misread and stereotype us as crazy and mean. The main characters are so likeable! I have a sense of humor about my heritage, so whoever said this review isn't helpful either didn't like the movie and didn't approve of me saying I did, or they have no sense of humor.

But the heart of the movie is the two hillbillies and as said before they do not disappoint. The encounters and miss understandings between the hillbillies and college kids make for a lot of fun. I will be watching this movie frequently and i suggest you check it out as well. The emphasis is more on the comedy in this movie but make no mistake things do get bloody and when they do its pulled of quite well.

Tucker and Dale is not full of bad acting.

Tucker and Dale is not a bad script with crappy jokes.

Tucker and Dale is the best ""bad circumstances"" movie I have ever seen. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Not a minute of it. It won't be for everyone.

A well thought out flick with a twist on the teen slasher / hill billy genre. The tale chronicles two well meaning country boys as a group of teens believe that locals are trying to kill them. Hilarity ensues as the group of youngsters self destruct, much to the amazement of Tucker and Dale who try their best to stop the students from hurting themselves. A highly underrated film and a must see for anyone who enjoys a splash of comedy with their gore. Great acting and high cinematic production values only add to the plots appeal.

Just watched it again for the third time. I can't even begin to express how hilarious this movie is. It only gets better with every view!! I can't recommend this movie enough.",1345507200,,843,4.62

4701648,4,B005HI4LMS,"Set deep in the swampy wilds of West Virginia, Tucker And Dale Versus Evil (2010) is a mostly effective spoof of the backwoods horror genre, as a couple of buddies have some deadly encounters with a group of ""college kids"".  The gore is deliberately overdone, but the humor mostly avoids being too dumb or heavy-handed.  Seeing the numbers dwindle, as the students bumble around in the woods, is mostly a fun time, although the film has a less than perfect finish.

Hillbilly types Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine), are on their way to fix up a cabin in the woods, when they run across a group of students at a general store.  Dale is fascinated by the beautiful Alison (Katrina Bowden), but approaching her carrying a scythe, only manages to terrify her and her friends.  Led by Chad (Jesse Moss), the eight students head into the woods and set up a camp, and are doing some moonlight swimming when Ally trips, and falls into the water.  Out on the lake fishing, Tucker and Dale rescue the unconscious girl, but when they call out to her friends, they mistakenly believe that the hillbillies have abducted her.

Ally wakes up the next day, and finds that her rescuers mean her no harm.  She hangs out with Dale, while her friends have gathered outside the cabin.  Proceeding on some incorrect assumptions, what follows is a series of goofy mishaps, that results in the gory deaths of the earnest but misguided ""college kids"", and a law enforcement officer.  The deaths include a couple of impalements, and one genius accidentally diving into a wood chipper.  The body count continues to rise, until the plot takes a turn, as one of the students is revealed to have a secret agenda.  When Tucker is hurt, Dale steps forward to rescue his new love Alison.

Co-written and directed by Eli Craig, the film gets off to a good start, and moves along briskly.  A backstory involving killer hillbillies emerges as the death by accident ploy has worn thin.  Dale, Alison, and Tucker, make a good team, but with three heroes and only one villain remaining, the writers evened things up a bit, by putting an injured Tucker on sidelines.  So instead of Tucker and Dale gloriously saving the day, we have Dale limply employing some tea leaves, to conclude his grand hillbilly's fantasy.  It's not the most winning of finishes.

While great fun, and definitely recommended to fans of backwoods horror, perhaps the large number of bad horror comedies, makes Tucker And Dale vs. Evil appear to be better by comparison than it really is.  Tyler Labine is terrific in his role, and he and Alan Tudyk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B004ZJZPXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>) make a solid team.  The inability to feature them together at the end, seems like a huge missed opportunity.  The rest of the cast does a very good job, particularly Katrina Bowden (30 Rock), who also works especially well with Labine.",1343865600,,3095,5.162324649298597
4701649,5,B005HI4LMS,"I really appreciated the fun of the twist on plots of the genre. And I cannot stress enough how well Tucker and Dale were cast. Alan Tudyk has got to be one of the most underrated talents on the screen today and Tyler Labine plays perfectly the line between believable hillbilly and ""maybe an evil crazy killer?"" I have recommended it to friends and co-workers alike - not so much as some ground-breaking oscar film, but as a movie that is just plain fun.",1343865600,,455,4.428571428571429
4701650,4,B005HI4LMS,"A really pleasant surprise - at first it seemed it would be just a silly one-off extended skit on reversing the old hillbilly slasher flicks. But it was so well-intentioned and it simply just kept rolling out such hilarious comic scenes that one couldn't help giggling, then snorting, and then outright crying with laughter. As usual Alan Tudyk was great, he is a fine actor, and his comic timing and facial expression are priceless. But the rest of the cast is (for the most part) almost equally as good. A few weak links keep this from being a classic farce - a few of the characters seem penciled into the script and, as a result, come off more than a bit wooden. But overall, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is worth watching  because it works so hard and so competently to be funny, and most of the time, it succeeds. Films nowadays that generate real comedy don't come around all that often. Three-and-a-half stars that deserves the rounding up because any film that can make me laugh on a Sunday night is golden.",1343520000,,1010,4.51912568306011

I don't know why this movie isn't better known; it's hysterical. If I had any complaints, it would be that the jokes sometimes have too much of a lead up, you kind of see the punch line coming a few times. It's hardly trite, though-for example, I would have hardly expected to truly like Allison like I did. (She turns out to be every bit as likable as our poor protagonists.) Bear in mind that this is comparable to ""Army of Darkness"", and can be quite violent at moments. For me, this adds to the humor and to the plot, because it's more apt and surprising in it's rampant silliness. You honestly can't predict just how stupid the characters are going to get-which is hilarious. This is so original. I've already seen it over and over. Never gets old.

I never stopped laughing, and as someone else has already pointed out, the hillbillies in this story are the innocent parties, and the college kids are just plum crazy. While to some extent they college kids and hillbillies are your stereotypical types, but on the other hand, it is the stupid ignorance and innocence of the hillbillies and the ridiculous ideas of the college kids, that gets them all into trouble. Suffice it to say, what this movie lacks in big name actors and budget,is made up ten fold with the story line and hilariousness of the scenarios that poor Tucker and Dale are thrust into, in most cases unwittingly.

4701678,5,B005HI4LMS,I don't want to give away too much in the review but I'll say it's a great funny movie to watch. It's about a group of college kids who are extremely prejudiced against hilly billy folk and one kid pushes them all further down that road because of his family history. Then there is the hilly billy dudes who just seem to be in the wrong place all of the time.,1335657600,,359,4.070422535211268

4701682,4,B005HI4LMS,"""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is a comedy and horror and - believe me or not - romance rolled into one. The Canadian-American film is an instant cult classic like the 80s Sam Raimi films starring great Bruce Campbell. It has interesting characters, clever (and crazy) jokes and capable acting, but its approach to the subject matter is rather an orthodox one.

The film, first-time directed and co-written by Eli Craig, is about Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine), two good-natured guys mistaken for ""cannibalistic mountain people"" by college students. When Dale saves Allison (Katrina Bowden), who fell into the river, these students, who must have seen ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" jump to the conclusion: she is being kidnapped! Led by Chad (Jesse Moss), who obviously has some reason to be enthusiastic, the students attempt to ""rescue"" Allison. Of course, their mission goes terribly wrong.

Part satire and part slapstick, ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" makes a good use of familiar horror movie elements - a rundown cabin in the woods, a chainsaw-wielding killer, etc. - and turn them into blood-soaked gags. Those jokes may lose their humor if overdone, but the film quickly moves on before this happens, wrapping the story up in a more conventional but satisfactory way.

To me, the most impressive thing about the film is characters, especially Tucker and Dale, a horror version of Laurel and Hardy. Well-meaning Allison and her therapy session is also nice.",1335312000,2,1475,5.012244897959183

I don't normally write reviews of movies, but for a low budget film, it doesn't in my opinion get any better then this....a great 'original', as this side of the story is not going to be what you think, has so many twists and turns, it's a great movie! As some one else said, invite some friends over, have some beer and whatnot, and enjoy this movie, I will definitely watch this again later. 10 stars out of 5 if that was possible!!!",1334880000,,849,4.182926829268292

4701691,4,B005HI4LMS,"A group of college kids go out to the woods to party... now wait, before you say ""oh that cliche"" hang on a second. At the same time as the kids go up, Dale and Tucker, a couple of Hillbillies have just bought a vacation home up in the same area of the woods. One night when they be a fishin' they encounter the college kids going for a skinny dip, and one of the kids ends up being startled by them, and falls into the water just after she hits her head on a rock... now Dale and Tucker didn't mean to frighten her, so they help her out of the water and attempt to have her friends come get her, but they get spooked and run off, so they take the pretty little girl back to their cabin to let her rest and intend for her friends to come by soon and pick her up. But her friends think the hillbillies are kidnappers and what not.

Now you can probably see where this movie is going... as the college kids try to find their missing friend, one by one they accidentally start, well, killing themselves accidentally. Now you should get the gist of this comedy movie and what is going on here. Dale and Tucker are innocent and wouldn't kill anyone, but bad luck just seems to follow them around and things just start happening.

It's not the first time a movie like this has been made where someone thinks, or there IS a maniac on the loose and people accidentally die, one such attempt almost worked in ""I know what you did last Friday the 13th"" which had its moments, but this film really nails it in a clever little way that is not only smart, but also hilarious and almost brilliant at the same time.

Definitely worthy of purchasing your own comedy if this sort of thing already sounds appealing to you.",1334361600,,1704,4.220858895705521

This movie was similar to The A-Team, in that I didn't go into it expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.

Basically you have Tucker and Dale that are looking forward to fixing up a cabin they bought and a bunch of college kids looking forward to a week of camping in the woods.  Due to some bad first impressions and some accidents, people start dying and each group thinks the other group is trying to kill them!  It's one of the funnier movies I've seen in a long time.  At no point do you ever really get ""scared"", like in a true horror movie.  I wouldn't let young kids watch it, but people who normally don't like horror movies would enjoy this movie.",1334188800,,897,4.27810650887574

And while some cliche things happened in the movie, enough twist happened, that it keeps you on your toes and wondering whats going to happen next?

I rated it 5 star because of the ending. With the way things were going it actually surprised me.

4701701,5,B005HI4LMS,"If you're a slasher movie aficionado, you're going to love Tucker and Dale vs Evil.  Carefully and cleverly inverting the backwoods-hillbilly variant of psycho-killer movies, T&DvE places two incredibly nice, unbelievably sweet hillfolk centerstage, while the sexy college kids provide the actual evil in this film.  A comedy of errors gone horribly, horribly awry, T&DvE has plenty of laughs that tribute, rather than spoof, the genre it satirizes.  Firefly's Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine are pitch perfect as modern, civilized bumpkins who want nothing more than to spruce up their new vacation home by the lake, while Katrina Bowden actually gets a chance to act in a great Final Girl twist.  The cast of college teens is largely interchangeable, but props go to Jesse Moss for being the douchiest ""prey"" to turn predator to date.

This is a seriously fun movie that has obvious love for its source material.  Fans of the genre - esp. some of the wackier installments (like Nightmare on Elm Street Pt 2 or Jason X) - should not miss this movie.",1333324800,3,1046,4.9147727272727275

4701705,5,B005HI4LMS,"I didn't expect much coming into this movie, but found myself laughing the entire way through. Being from the country, I could relate to a lot of these situations, and every character fit perfectly into their stereotypes, with plenty of pleasant twists.

After I watched it twice on Prime I decided it was definitely worth owning so I could go back to my hometown and show the friends. They don't typically have patience to actually sit through a movie without getting distracted, but I thought this one might just do the trick, and sure enough, we were laughing through the entire thing. For being an apparently low-budget and relatively unheard of movie, this probably had some of the most clever writing I've seen in a modern comedy. Everything, literally everything, was some kind of joke. A lot of subtle humor that can slip by you as well, that I only caught the third time through watching it. Great show, five stars.

As for the mature content, there is a fair amount of gore, a fair amount of misc. swearing and a liberal use of the ""f"" word (I haven't counted but I would say easily double digits for the F-bombs, maybe more than 20)... but aside from that and some brief and distant nudity it is relatively tame (a character wears somewhat revealing clothing as well). That being said, they could have taken a LOT more liberties and this ranks as one of the most tame R rated horror/comedies I've seen in a long time. Probably not suited for young audiences.",1333065600,,1469,4.624521072796935

Well folks, it's not even close.  The acting wasn't even close to how bad I thought it would be, nor was the storyline.  It's been quite a long time that I sat through a movie that I totally & completely enjoyed.",1332979200,,386,4.1066666666666665
4701708,5,B005HI4LMS,"I can't begin to state how much I love this movie. Since coming in I've watched it three times and feel like I could watch it again and still find myself laughing all the way. That's rare these days and for me was a special treat as the same week I first watched it I fell in love with ATTACK THE BLOCK as well. To find one movie that can be rewatched over and over again is rare but two the same week?

While not an outright parody, the movie takes set ups for horror movies that have become rather routine and turns them upside down to make one funny movie. Having recently sat through WRONG TURN 4, this movie was a perfect match for that with the exception that this one was so much better.

A stereotypical group of college students are on their way to a camping trip in the back woods of West Virginia. On the road they are passed by two stereotypically looking redneck hillbillies in their battered old truck. Of course the students conjure up images of killer hillbillies when they see them.

On the other hand we get to meet the pair from their perspective. Tucker and Dale are just two friends on their way to a cabin that Tucker has just purchased. This will be their summer getaway retreat where they can fish and drink beer and have a good old time. Their interest in college kids is for the most part non-existent.

They encounter the same duo when they stop at a general store to buy beer and ice. There Dale tells Tucker that the one girl is really good looking. Tucker encourages him to go talk to them girls and show confidence when he does so by smiling and laughing. Of course when Dale chooses to walk over while holding a scythe and then giggling maniacally the kids think he's a psycho ready to kill them.

Each group reaches their destination and the lead guy with the kids sits at the campfire telling them about a killer who once roamed the woods they are now in. Descriptions of hillbilly killers who hunted down a group of campers set the teens on edge which they break by deciding to go skinny dipping. One of them, Allison, falls and hits her head. Who comes to her rescue but Tucker and Dale, out on the lake drinking beer and fishing. When they call to the kids for help, the kids think they've captured their friend and are eating her face (as opposed to giving her mouth to mouth).

The next morning Allison wakes to discover the two men aren't crazy at all and begins to get to know them. At the same time the students have formed their own opinion. Having seen movies about killer hillbillies, they've decided that Allison has been kidnapped and set out to rescue her. What follows is a comedy of errors where teens view every action as an attack and where Tucker and Dale see each failed attack as being done by crazy college kids who they assume have joined for a suicide pact.

The humor in this film is so over the top that just as you finish laughing at one event another pops up and you start laughing again. One example I can share (since it's in the trailer for the movie) is when Tucker is tossing wood into a wood chipper. One of the kids plans on jumping him. Tucker can't hear a thing over the noise of the chipper and when the kid goes to jump him, Tucker bends down to pick up another piece of wood which results in the kid jumping head first into the chipper. Yes, it's gory but the absurdity of the whole situation makes the entire episode hilarious.

The movie is extremely well made, everything from the sets to the directing to the special effects works perfect. The acting is stupendous, especially from Tyler Dabine as Dale and Alan Tudyk as Tucker. It seems as if they were born for these roles.

As I said at the beginning this movie had me laughing from start to finish. Fans of horror films will no doubt recognize the source material for many of the scenes in the film. Non-horror fans will laugh at the mishaps over and over again. If you're a fan of humor or a fan of horror or a fan of them combined, then by all means you need to have this film in your collection. I'm looking forward to my fourth viewing with my nephew, a fan of both genres. My guess is I'll have to keep my finger on the remote to pause until he can catch a breath while laughing so hard.",1332806400,,4224,4.296482412060302

4701726,3,B005HI4LMS,"One thing is for certain:  Way too many people are being way too generous on these movie-ratings.

Let's put this in perspective, shall we?

First of all, a 5 star movie (to me) means that the movie is basically ""perfect"".  Sorry-I have
yet to see a ""perfect"" movie.  Ratings SHOULD be in at least .5 increments, as to more accurately
give potential viewers more clarity as to just how ""entertaining"" a movie truly is. We are denied this, clearly.
So, having said that, let's get back to the ratings.

A 4 star movie (actually, a 4.5 or 4.75 ideally) would be a movie like ""Braveheart"" or ""Titantic"", ""Ransom"", ""Forest Gump"",
""Man On Fire"", etc.  Outstanding quality in almost all categories.  Premium movies, if you will.

3 star movies account for the majority of flicks that I personally view.  3 Star movies basically means this:  The movie was entertaining at a level that suggests that yes, indeed, the 1.5 hours you invested to watch such movie was time worth ""wasting"" on such movie, but by no means is the movie a stand-out from the crowd, nor a truly ""powerful & engaging"" film.  It's a ""watch once, reap SOME enjoyment"" and move on.  Again, this makes up the bulk of movies out there.

2 star rated movies, obviously, are those that are really just not worth that 1.5 hours of your time.  Other activities in your life to partake in would more than likely be the better route to take, than to sit through one of these movies.  However, the value of a 2 star movie comes into play when the potential viewer truly has NOTHING else to do, and perhaps gained ""salt-sized particles"" of enjoyment.  These movies stink, basically.  A laugh or two, or a scene (or two) brought some value, but nothing else.

1 star rated movies are horrid.  They are/were a waste of time, and often can leave the viewer a bit upset that they just in fact ""threw away"" 1.5 hours of their time.  These movies usually are ""laughable"" in that they just stink that bad.  Not much more to say about these.

So, here we are to this specific movie.  I will not carry on with my review, because truly all you need to know is that the movie is a 3-star movie.  Enjoy.",1331337600,,2143,4.475452196382429

4701728,3,B005HI4LMS,"A very humorous twist on the college kids v. the crazed hillbillies. Lots of stuff to indicate a B movie, but more laughs than a lot of the big budget 'comedies"". Have a few beers, some friends and a good laugh.",1331337600,4,211,4.170731707317073
4701729,5,B005HI4LMS,"This is a great movie that was seriously wronged by the mainstream Hollywood establishment.  I was lucky enough to catch this in a small indie theater in Tucson last year while stationed nearby in Fort Hauchuca, and man was it a find!

In much the same fashion of ""Behind the Mask"" this is yet another brilliantly written satire on the cliched horror genre, but in my opinion this one has far superior acting.  The story revolves around 2 loveable buddies who happen to be hillbillies.  Like most of America, you probably have preconceived notions about hillbillies due to 1. (in my opinion) stuipid, racist horror movies and 2. just the way the liberal media paints anyone who doesn't bow to their idealism.  However rather than falling into the stereotype that the media paints of hillbillies, Tucker and Dale are just 2 pretty average, if somewhat goofy guys who just want to enjoy their vacation home.  Their peace is shattered however when a group of college kids arrive and one of them, Allison, falls into a lake and needs saving.  Dale quickly rescues her but the rest of the kids think the rescue looks more like a kidnapping and resolve to ""kill those evil hillbillies and save Allison.""

Tucker and Dale meanwhile try to make things right but the college kids are deaf to reason and also are terribly accident prone and start dying all over the place while trying to kill Tucker and Dale.  Allison meanwhile starts seeing what Tucker and Dale are really like and starts being their friends and even falling for Dale.

All in all, its a silly, fun movie.  Theres no vicious stereotypes, (except maybe that college kids are stupid which Im sure is one that we can all agree is actually pretty damn true lol) not excessive swearing, no nudity or sex, but plenty of blood and guts, lots of satirical humor and some truly great chemistry between both Tucker and Dale, and Dale and Allison.

4701736,4,B005HI4LMS,"We've had Tucker & Dale vs. Evil sitting in our Netflix queue for awhile. One of our friends liked it so much that - during the movie - she sent us a note encouraging us to see it.  You don't get that kind of endorsement every day, so we set aside time to watch it.  We were not disappointed.

Where to start?  I was crestfallen when Reaper went off the air, so I was delighted to see Tyler Labine back in lovable form as Dale, a hillbilly with a heart of gold. His love interest is the gorgeous but underused Katrina Bowden (of 30 Rock) as Allison. Dale's best friend Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and a bevy of college morons rounds out the cast.  The college kids are off to a party in the woods which just happens to coincide with Tucker and Dale's plans to revamp their ""vacation home."" When the two groups meet at a gas station - Dale forgets to put down the scythe in his hands when he tries to politely meet the college beauties - things don't go well.

If this sounds like the plot of a typical horror movie (well, minus the ""vacation home"" part), it is.  When Tucker and Dale visit the rundown cabin it's a spitting image of the cabin from Evil Dead. It seems the cabin is in the same area as The Memorial Day Massacre, which Chad (Jesse Moss) recounts in curiously lurid detail.  It's not long before everyone decides to go skinny dipping (of course). Things go hilariously wrong from there.

Tucker & Dale alternates between showing typical horror tropes from the college kids' perspective and then giving them perfectly innocent (if unlikely) explanations for them from the hillbillies' perspective. The college kids are convinced the hillbillies are the murderers from the Memorial Day Massacre. Conversely, it's not long before the two buds are convinced the kids are part of a suicide pact, hell-bent on taking everyone with them.

The movie pivots on the relationship between Dale and Allison; less likeable leads would have ruined the movie, but here they're both terrifically cute in a film dripping with gore. As appealing though the burgeoning romance between the furry hillbilly and the blonde college co-ed is, it's the best friends who really cement the movie. Tucker and Dale's relationship never flags even when one of them starts losing appendages.

The one element that works against the film is the titular ""Evil"" of the title.  It's not hard to spot who is the real villain and unfortunately Tucker & Dale telegraphs him a little too early.  That doesn't detract from the careful plotting and clever script, which delivers on all its promises.

Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a love letter to cult horror fans that's not afraid to throw a little love into the plot too.  If you're a fan of Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, or any of their successors you won't be disappointed.",1330819200,,2786,4.611336032388664

4701775,5,B005HI4LMS,"One of the best horror films of all time was SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  It wasn't the first horror comedy (I will always have a soft spot in my heart for LOVE AT FIRST BITE and Roger Corman's LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS), but its success inspired studios to combine two genres haphazardly.  Like various chemicals, horror and comedy work amazingly well when combined in the right proportions; but when mixed wrongly, the concoction tends to explode in your face.

TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is definitely a successful mixture.  The film follows the lovable oaf Dale (Tyler Labine, SONS OF TUSCON), and his good pal Tucker (Alan Tudyk, SERENITY), as they head out to the country their fixer-upper ""vacation home.""  It's a dream come true!  Except for the bigoted college kids who have a very similar idea.  One of the beautiful coeds (Katrina Bowden, 30 ROCK) slips and hurts her head; when Dale and Tucker rescue her, her friends get the wrong idea and scatter into the woods.  They begin to plot their revenge; but what they can't plan for is the fact that stupidity is a two-edged sword.

There's a reason I referred to the characters as ""Dale and Tucker"" and not the other way around: this is Labine's film, and he carries it admirably.  Tudyk is great, too, and Bowden is spectacular (for those of us who only know her from her limited 30 ROCK role).  Of the other kids, Jesse Moss--as the devolving Chad--is the standout.  Eli Craig's directing is very sure-handed, considering it's his first time out, and the script is rock-solid: very subtle, very very funny if you pay close attention.  There's heaping handfuls of gore thrown on top of everything, and just enough of a dark edge to make it interesting.  (Don't worry: it never gets so dark that you stop laughing.  You'll think it's heading there, but it isn't.)  TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is, hands down, one of the best (in fact, one of only a few good) horror/comedies to be released recently.

They run into some college kids that mistake them for maniacal psychos. When Allison of the group falls in the lake, Tucker and Dale save her, but Allison's friends assume they kidnapped her.

4701778,4,B005HI4LMS,"I can't say I recall any precedent for this movie. Though it can be considered an entry into the slasher genre it stands out as being unique in its storyline.

Here's the scoop. A group of college friends are off to go camping in the mountains of Virginia. Tucker and Dale are, coincidentally, going to be nearby to renovate Tucker's new ""summer home."" The two parties happen to run into each other at a gas station/store where a minor misunderstanding ensues. Later that day, as their paths cross again, the misunderstanding escalates to the point where bodies begin to pile up. Things are now so far out of hand there may be no way to get back to square one.

This is a pretty wild ride. Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) do not play the stereotypical hillbillies. They're goodhearted, gentle souls who want to take their less than ideal circumstances and raise them up a notch or two with this summer home. The college kids are are an Okay lot though maybe a bit wary of their surroundings and those that inhabit them. One of their bunch, though, is a nasty sort who is almost singularly responsible for things getting out of hand. Once the ball gets rolling the movie becomes a series of set pieces. You see where it's going. You just don't know how it will get there. Some of the missteps strain credulity but it's still fun to watch.

A fair amount of the budget seems to have been spent on the gore effects of which there are many. They're done pretty well. It's shot and edited well enough to make it work. The acting is decent and the characters are fun. This is just a weirdly funny movie.

But don't expect any of THAT to actually appear in ""Tucker & Dale Vs Evil,"" a clever black comedy that asks, ""What if the HILLBILLIES were the innocent victims of the doomed college kids?"" Tropes are inverted (or lampshaded), there's gore aplenty, and Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine make endearingly rough-hewn heroes.

West Virginia hillbillies Dale (Labine) and Tucker (Tudyk) have just bought a dilapidated little house out by a remote lake, and plan to spend some time fishing and drinking beer. They also end up rescuing Allison (Katrina Bowden), a college student who hit her head while swimming, and she soon finds that these seemingly terrifying hillbillies are actually kind, gentle and sometimes quite smart.

Unfortunately, Allison's friends get the wrong idea, and think that she's being held captive by a pair of chainsaw-swinging psychos. As they try to attack Dale and Tucker, they end up accidentally dying in bizarre and gory ways. As Dale, Tucker and Allison try to defuse the situation, they also have to deal with the increasingly bloodthirsty Chad (Jesse Moss).

I have no idea why it's taken so long for ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" to make it onto DVD, because this movie is absolutely hilarious -- a gory, satirical little comedy that acknowledges every hillbilly-slasher cliche right before turning it on its ear. And yes, writer/director Eli Craig homages many a horror movie, from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Friday the 13th.""

And even though it's obviously a spoof, ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" is actually very well-written -- clever foreshadowing, a shocking climactic twist, and all sorts of hilarious situations that make Dale and Tucker look... well, like psycho hillbillies. For instance: Tucker accidentally destroys a beehive, and ends up racing through the woods, screaming and waving his chainsaw spastically.

And yes, there are lots of OTHER hilarious moments, such as lampshading hillbilly stereotypes (""Oh, I love Earl Grey"") and the college kids' gory deaths (impaling themselves on sticks or jumping into woodchippers).

And the acting is absolutely brilliant. Labine and Tudyk are amazing as the protagonists, respectively playing a sweet timid teddy bear and an outgoing good ol' boy. Yeah, don't judge these guys from their appearances, because you will be ALL WRONG. And the rest of the small cast also does an excellent job, especially given that most of them are shrieking horror movie cliches.

Except in this case, nothing turns out like you'd expect, because those scary hillbillies turn out to be none other than Tucker and Dale, decent and hapless hicks out on vacation in an old cabin, who just can't understand why the college kids are so afraid of them.

That's not to say that it's necessarily Oscar-worthy; it's just that it is so rare these days to see a good premise be so flawlessly executed. The writing is clever, slowly building tension then delivering jokes (or fatalities) before building tension again.

Anyone familiar with horror movies, especially of the ""a group of kids go into the woods..."" variety, will see references to classic elements from favorite films - the haunted-looking cabin in the woods, the use of certain power and hand tools, creepy townsfolk, etc. But the director does a great job of helping the audience to see both the frightening and the ordinary in each of those scenarios. Is the cabin creepy, or just a DIY project away from a great vacation home? Is the local yokel whose laugh makes your skin crawl actually dangerous, or just nervous around pretty girls?  and so on.

Likable lead roles and appropriately two-dimensional secondary characters are ably portrayed by the cast, although the rapport between Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) is truly exceptional and a key reason why the movie works so well.

AWESOME! NON STOP LAUGHS!
I wasn't dissapointed one bit!

This movie had me laughing from the beginning. Well done on all sides, character developement was spot on too, usually there is an overboard on one group, either protagonist or antagonist is horribly under-developed.

The story is written so you can honestly side with the college kids being scared out of their minds. Not hard to do ever since Deliverance. But the movie doesn't rely on dark shots and creepy lurking to make you feel that way like a traditional horror movie would, in part because it's not a straight up horror movie it's actually a Comedy with blood and guts but not so much it's annoying. It has a sunny and happy disposition almost the whole way through despite the communication issues between Tucker, Dale and the College kids.

You really do have to feel bad for Tucker and Dale being stereotyped as axe weilding psychopaths. It's really not their fault they're hillbillies born in raised in WV. But that's what makes this movie so great, the expected stereotype and how these two simple country folk deal with their situation.

The tables are turned this time as Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and his best friend Dale (Tyler Labine) head out to their new ""vacation home"" deep in the West Virginia woods.  A gaggle of college kids are also planning on a little camping and relaxation from the grind of their studies.  Initially the two groups run into each other at a gas station loading up on vittles and beer.  Tucker and Dale fit the killer redneck profile to a tee, but are actually sweet simpletons happy with their fate in life and the fact that they have their wreck of a cabin - a fixer-upper - (previously owned by a serial killer based on the decorative treatments including a wall full of horrifying newspaper clippings).

In the late afternoon, while fishing near a spot the college kids decide to go skinny dipping, Tuck and Dale  rescue one of the coeds who slipped and hit her head on her way into the lake.  They put her in the boat, while the rest of the college kids run away in fear.  With no other simple option Tuck and Dale take the comely lass (Katrina Bowden from ""30 Rock"") back to their cabin unconscious.  Let me digress here for a minute and note that Ms. Bowden is a decent actress but has an Olympic class bare midriff that is terribly distracting for most of the film, so be forewarned.

Katrina Bowden as the heroine Allison plays perfectly with Labine and Turdyk, and the whole cast is great, especially Jesse Moss as Chad, the real nutcase.  Writer/director Eli Craig is to be commended for his debut effort.
The film is quite entertaining and welcomely original in a tired genre.  This is one movie I could see earning a sequel--if it's as good as this one.",1323475200,,926,4.941935483870968

This movie takes where horror spoofs ( Scary Movie specifically) went wrong and fixes a few things. If you took Friday the 13th, Evil Dead, Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and mixed them with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, you would get Tucker and Dale vs Evil.
On a final note; beer cures everything from depression, bee stings and severed body parts.

Although they should of called the film Tucker & Dale vs. College Kids...that is my only complaint!  My wife and I sat and watched this with our 18 year old college student and we laughed our butts off because we know how teenagers act and we could relate!  Although this is a low budget movie it is pretty well done for the special gore effects.  The one-liners from the two hillbillies is what makes this movie though!  For a horror movie...this one is quite original!  Think Evil Dead movies...if you enjoyed that series....you'll enjoy this one!,1322870400,4,696,4.433070866141732

Tucker and Dale at first are mistaken (by college kids) for psycho hillbillie rednecks. We soon see they are just 2 friends that just want their PBR and to go fishing. The kids are so paranoid of Tucker and Dale that, they end up killing their own friends. Gruesome deaths galore here folks.

Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine were both spot on as a pair of baffled country boys completely out of their depth and confused by the absurd situation that they found themselves in.  Katrina Bowden did a good job as the object of Labine's affections (it was nice to see her get a bit more dialogue to work with than you see out of 30 Rock), and the supporting cast performed admirably.

The writing deftly defuses what could easily be a chillingly frightening situation with an injection of perfectly toned comedy, especially in the dialogue exchanged by the title characters.

The fact that Piranha 3D got a wide release while this gem struggled still has me baffled.",1322006400,,772,4.613138686131387

4701812,5,B005HI4LMS,"I am a big movie lover, especially weird unknown outside the box movies so this movies hits my genre perfectly. Before I start reviewing the movie I do wanna say that I typically do not rate comedies very high. I think most comedies these days just arnt funny, maybe I am just picky, who knows.

Here are a few things that stood out to me:

ACTING:
I have never watched a comedy where the main actor (Dale - Tyler Labine) is the only actor with any jokes and the rest are just supporting roles (I don't remember ever laughing at anyone else besides dale) and it not bust. It was like the whole movie they were trying so hard to over-do Dale but it never worked, you still laughed at every word that came out of his mouth.

I really hope to see Tyler Labine in more stuff, he was just incredible in this movie.

STORY LINE:
I loved everything about the story line of this movie. Tucker and Dale just bought a new vacation home in the boonies and they accidently run into some college kids who are creeped out by T&D. It gets much worse when one of the college kids gets knocked out and T&D try to help her but the other kids think they are kidnapping her. It has a lot of twists and turns after that and the ending is great.

SUMMARY:
The whole movie is just brilliantly refreshing and I recommend it to anyone!

4701813,5,B005HI4LMS,"When a bunch of stereotypical college students make stereotypical assumptions of a couple of rednecks, all hell breaks loose in the horror comedy Tucker and Dale vs. Evil.  I don't want to give away any more than that quick summary, as I wouldn't dream of ruining your movie watching enjoyment.

TaDvE, is horrifying and hilarious.  It takes bold shots at The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Evil Dead (I & II).  It works as a comedy and as a gore-filled horror romp.  The rarest of the rare.

Tudyk and Labine have solid chemistry as Tucker and Dale, respectively, and they work well together as an inspired new comedy duo in the tradition of Jake and Elwood Blues and Abbott and Costello.  Their comedic timing in both the physical and the verbal aspects are dead on (pun intended).  I sincerely would love to see them in a sequel.

Director Craig, making his film debut, has a keen eye for action and comedy.  I read in Entertainment Weekly that his mother, Sally Field (!), read the script and approved.  High praise indeed.  Cinematographer David Geddes uses some unusual and effective angles to heighten the tension and the laughs.  Writers Craig and Morgen Jurgenson have created memorable characters placed in a crazy-ass situation.

I loved, loved this movie.  I can see it becoming a cult film being shown at midnight showings in the future.  I'm sure it will become a favorite of mine.

It didn't get much of a distribution into theaters, so be sure to seek it out on blu-ray or DVD.  If you like good comedy and don't mind some red splashing around, this will fit the bill quite nicely.",1321142400,,1633,4.690140845070423
4701814,5,B005HI4LMS,"Director and co-writer Eli Craig's unexpected foray into what at first seems like a done-to-death (pun intended) genre of the stoned-college-kids-in-the-woods-who-meet-a-depraved-and bloody-demise.

But this time, the conceit is turned upside down and inside out when a group of college kids misunderstand the intent of two gentle hillbillies they encounter on their way to a remote woods getaway and beer fest.

What actually happens is, instead of being chased by an inbred psycho, the dumb kids -- in their desperate attempt to escape the assumed horror -- do themselves in.  This massive comedy of errors is sustained almost to the end when it shifts to a more traditional climax.  It all begins when Tucker and Dale (Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk), two benignly sweet backwoods rednecks rescue a pretty college girl from drowning and it is assumed by her friends that she's been kidnapped and tortured.  The relationship of the girl (Katrina Bowden) and the sweeter of the hillbillies is surprising and sometimes touching.  Although there are grotesquely funny bloody moments in the multiple, inventive deaths, this is not a slasher film but a mockery of the genre.

I was not ready for the kid who accidentally dives into the woodchopper in an attempt to tackle his assumed nemesis, but it's hard not to laugh even as the blood sprays.  Tucker & Dale are not Laurel & Hardy, but they evoke a similar kind of affection because we understand and root for them.  This is a borderline brilliant film that is well on its way to genuine cult status.  Tucker & Dale!  May their tribe increase.",1320796800,,1590,4.962264150943396

4701816,5,B005HI4LMS,"Over the years, movies like ""Deliverance"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and ""Wrong Turn"" have turned the 'evil hillbilly' into a well recognized sub-genre of horror. But did anyone ever stop to think that maybe the evil hillbillies were victims? Maybe they were just fighting back against the evil city folk wreaking havoc in their front yards! ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"" is a creative spin on this sub-genre of horror, similar to how ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland"" portrayed a more comedic side of the zombie sub-genre. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine were fantastic as the good-intentioned and lovable Tucker and Dale, and the actors/actresses playing the college kids were easy to hate. Ultimately, if you want a good laugh, don't mind a moderate amount of gore, and enjoy some action and romance, this is the movie for you.",1319932800,,824,4.9352517985611515
4701817,5,B005HI4LMS,"The set up is a lot like the recent installments of the Texas Chainsaw and Hills Have Eyes franchises or Wrong Turn.  A group of college kids go camping in the woods.  They're unnerved by the backwoods, hillbilly-chic locals.  And, naturally, they suspect the worst of them.  Perhaps for the first time in horror movie history, these kids assumptions were wrong.

Tucker (Alan Tudyk; A Knight's Tale, 28 Days) and Dale (Tyler Labine; Rise of the Planet of the Apes, TV's Mad Love) are two loveable, kind-intentioned idiots on a bro-mantic fishing trip.  Their interactions with the campers are misconstrued such that they appear to have performed malevolent deeds.  After nearly drowning, Tucker and Dale save Ally (Katrina Bowden; Piranha 3D, 30 Rock) of the girls.  But when they pull her into their boat and yell ""we have your friend"" to the others, it is perceived that they ""took"" her and then cruelly goaded them.  Naturally, when Ally regains consciousness, she thinks she's been abducted.

Just from the trailer I think everyone knew that this would just ""work"" on film.  This was Eli Craig's first job as director (he wrote this, too) and I'm itching to see what he does next.  He took a smart comic premise and peppered in some solid doses of Sam Raimi-esque gore.  As the kids try to ""rescue"" Ally from her ""captors"" they get accidently killed under silly circumstances delivered with perfect timing.  A true horror hound, I tend to laugh at many of the kills in serious horror flicks.  But this movie invites all to join in the laughter as mulched entrails shower over the face of a mortified friend.

American Psycho and the Scream franchise may have mastered the slasher movie satire.  But this stands out as more of a paramount slasher movie farce, much as Shaun of the Dead was for zombie fare.",1319932800,61,1810,4.768488745980707

The film is silly and predictable, but charming and very clever, while I don't think it's a great film I have to admire it for doing something so many horror comedies fail to do. It made me laugh and I watched the entire 125 minute film, I know it's short, but that's a good thing.

It's equal parts slasher film, comedy of errors, feel-good buddy movie, and unexpected romance. It never gets too complicated or takes itself too seriously but keeps you entertained.  The gore is not over done.  In the beginning it's done as a comedy of errors and misunderstandings.  Later in the movie it's a complete role reversal from the standard horror film plot.  Overall it's a light, entertaining, and funny movie.  Most of the violence is pratfalls with gory results.  This movie is definitely not for kids and it does have it's gory/scary moments but it's almost a stretch to call it a horror film.

While out fishing they watch as a young college girl slips and falls in the water. When they go over to help her, her friends run away. When she wakes up she realizes that she is in no danger, but her friends don't know that and the set out to rescue her. This is one of the biggest surprises of the year. Easily one of the funniest movies to come out, and the only comedy/horror movie I have seen that can compete with ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and ""Zombieland"". The plot and dialog are hilarious and will have you laughing at stuff you wouldn't normally laugh at, like when a kid is ground up by a woodchopper. Which is followed by the line ""You ain't never gonna get that deposit back now."" For fans of ""Shaun"" or ""Zombieland"" this is right up your ally. For those that aren't you may still like this one. Very, very funny and the rare movie that you can put it and enjoy over and over. Definitely worth a watch.

The writing was excellent, so many absolutely hilarious lines I need to
watch it again and again. The setting was good. I was afraid it would
be too gory and it is gory but it felt just the right amount and it was
mixed in with funny. There were many emotions.

Alan Tudyk is brilliant. He is an amazing character actor and I love
watching him and seeing someone new he creates. Tyler Labine I have
been noticing for a while. I love the heart he puts into his
characters.

I think what I loved the most from this movie is how much it made me
laugh and how little it grossed me out. Perfect Halloween movie but not
for kids because of all the deaths.

Eli Craig I look forward to seeing more movies by you. Morgan Jurgenson
awesome lines too many funny ones to remember. Alan and Ty thank you so
much for a great movie. College kids way to go! I left the movie

When fun-loving, hardworking Tucker and Dale put all of their money into buying a new vacation home in the middle of the woods (token cabin in the woods).  They think everything is going to be on an up swing, that's until a group of ""college kids"" (or teen camper slasher victims as we are used to) decide they too need a get away.

When they cross paths with each other the college kids get all nervous and freak out, because as we all know ALL hillbillies are psychos (right?).  This is where the fun begins as a bunch of common misunderstandsings turn hilariously deadly in this fun little film. Misunderstandings that is with chainsaws, woodchippers, spears, scythes, and not to mention guns, this may be the film for you.

The acting is great, the story is very well done and executed.

Alan Tudyk does an amazing job as Tucker, a good ol' country boy who followed his dream of getting a vacation home in the woods with his good buddy Dale, played spectacularly well by Tyler Labine.  They just want to get some beer and go to their new vacation home/cabin, see it for the first time (apparently they bought it sight unseen, which is in keeping with their personalities) and start working on it as it was listed as a 'fixer upper'.

At the store as they're buying supplies they see some college kids and manage to freak them out royally because they're pretty socially awkward.  Actually, that's an understatement.  They're so socially awkward it's just a mess but it's very believable.

The action doesn't take long to get underway and from that point forward it's hard to look away from the screen (unless you're squeamish; there's a lot of blood and gore but it's hilariously done.  I didn't feel that anything was forced except for one small scene with a weed whacker.)

All told this movie is great.  If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead at all, this movie is for you.  And I think it's much better than Shaun of the Dead.",1314576000,3,1351,4.451219512195122
4701845,5,B005HI4LMS,"Ever seen a horror movie with hillbillies in it? They're usually psychotic chainsaw-swinging inbred cannibal psychos who like to murder anyone who happens to drive by.

But don't expect any of THAT to actually appear in ""Tucker & Dale Vs Evil,""  a clever black comedy that asks, ""What if the HILLBILLIES were the innocent victims of the doomed college kids?"" Tropes are inverted (or lampshaded), there's gore aplenty, and Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine make endearingly rough-hewn heroes.

West Virginia hillbillies Dale (Labine) and Tucker (Tudyk) have just bought a dilapidated little house out by a remote lake, and plan to spend some time fishing and drinking beer. They also end up rescuing Allison (Katrina Bowden), a college student who hit her head while swimming, and she soon finds that these seemingly terrifying hillbillies are actually kind, gentle and sometimes quite smart.

Unfortunately, Allison's friends get the wrong idea, and think that she's being held captive by a pair of chainsaw-swinging psychos. As they try to attack Dale and Tucker, they end up accidentally dying in bizarre and gory ways. As Dale, Tucker and Allison try to defuse the situation, they also have to deal with the increasingly bloodthirsty Chad (Jesse Moss).

I have no idea why it's taken so long for ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" to make it onto DVD, because this movie is absolutely hilarious -- a gory, satirical little comedy that acknowledges every hillbilly-slasher cliche right before turning it on its ear. And yes, writer/director Eli Craig homages many a horror movie, from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Friday the 13th.""

And even though it's obviously a spoof, ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" is actually very well-written -- clever foreshadowing, a shocking climactic twist, and all sorts of hilarious situations that make Dale and Tucker look... well, like psycho hillbillies. For instance: Tucker accidentally destroys a beehive, and ends up racing through the woods, screaming and waving his chainsaw spastically.

And yes, there are lots of OTHER hilarious moments, such as lampshading hillbilly stereotypes (""Oh, I love Earl Grey"") and the college kids' gory deaths (impaling themselves on sticks or jumping into woodchippers).

And the acting is absolutely brilliant. Labine and Tudyk are amazing as the protagonists, respectively playing a sweet timid teddy bear and an outgoing good ol' boy. Yeah, don't judge these guys from their appearances, because you will be ALL WRONG. And the rest of the small cast also does an excellent job, especially given that most of them are shrieking horror movie cliches.

""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" is pretty clearly destined to be a cult classic, right alongside other fun spoofs like ""Shaun of the Dead."" Hilarious, bloody and clever.",1313971200,186,2756,5.147651006711409
4701846,5,B005HI4LMS,"I was excited for this movie for a while when I first heard about it. I love Alan Tudyk in basically anything (I was a huge Firefly fan) and Tyler Labine rocked in Reaper. I'm also a big fan of the comedy/horror genre, although the idea of the main characters being hillbillies and it being a spoof... those factors turned me off. I have an unnatural hatred for the ""Blue collar"" humor that's become so popular lately. I hate people with ""redneck pride."" I find the whole cultural phenomenon annoying. So I was expecting a bunch of low brow jokes with great acting, that might average out to still be a fun movie to watch.

But, I was wrong. (Not about the fun movie part; that's still true.) The two West Virginian Hillbillies aren't portrayed overblown parodies of hillbillies that have become popular. They're just regular guys who you actually start to care for and like. The jokes aren't lowbrow at all. They're clever, witty, often perfectly ironic, well-timed and well-placed. There are few movies that make me laugh out loud, even with comedies that I like. This movie had me rolling. I was waking up people in my house from being too loud.

Tyler Labine, despite being a lesser known actor, gets the larger role and he shines in it. Alan Tudyk is a great supporting actor in this though, not letting me down in the slightest regard.

The movie hasn't been officially released yet, and at the time of writing this, there are no negative reviews on Amazon of it. When they do inevitably show up, ignore them. Anyone who didn't like it will have either gone in expecting a straight horror movie or they wanted Larry the Cable Guy in every role. Ignore it. If you're on the fence about watching this movie, I'm officially pushing you off of it. Go watch it.",1311120000,,1762,4.569620253164557
4701847,5,B005HI4LMS,"This movie was terrific.  It was hilarious and well acted.  I really thought this was better than most the crap out there today when I saw it at the Phoenix film festival in April 2011.  Not sure why it has not been either released in all theaters or at least put on DVD, but I will buy it the minute I see that it has been put on DVD.  Truly a funny funny film!",1310515200,,362,3.8513513513513513
4701848,5,B005HI4LMS,"Hillbillies have never been funnier than in ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil"". Ok...maybe they have been but you'd be hard pressed to find an instance.  This is an extremely cleverly written and well shot movie that shows how funny and out of control simple misunderstandings can become. High five to writers Morgan Jurgenson and Eli Craig (Craig also directed and makes a cameo as a news cameraman)

  Best friends Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) finally realize their dream of buying a vacation cabin in the backwoods of West Virginia, so they head up to relax and do some fishing. On the way up they bump into a group of college kids at a gas station also heading up to the lake for some partying fun. Right from the get-go the hilarity starts as Dale tries to talk to one of the girls who gets frightened by his hillbilly appearance and the large sickle he carries over as a walking stick. As the movie progresses Tucker and Dale are fishing at night while nearby the college kids are skinny-dipping.  One of the girls Allison (Katrina Bowden) falls of a rock and nearly drowns if not for the heroic efforts of Tucker and Dale. Unfortunately the kids only see them dragging her onto their boat and believe they are kidnapping her. The movie kicks into high gear as a series of misunderstandings and accidental deaths keep you wondering what will happen next!

  The special effects and gore were really well done on this one and the music score was spot on creating a wonderful feel to the movie. Great acting all around with some really memorable characters.  If you're looking for a well written, funny movie then I highly recommend ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil""
