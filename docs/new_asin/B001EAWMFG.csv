8297427,5,B001EAWMFG,"Great laugh out loud indie film.  A complete surprise with sharp writing and fantastic characters.  Everything comes tighter with this one.  If you're looking for a movie that you can watch with a group and that everyone won't have been seen a hundred times already, this is the one.  Well shot, well acted--great indie effort.",1269302400,,327,4.890909090909091
8297428,5,B001EAWMFG,"Great cast, great comedic timing, and a fun spin on something everyone can relate to!",1231200000,,85,4.733333333333333
8297429,4,B001EAWMFG,Story line was good.  Good guys and girls always seem to finish last.  Some scenes weren't needed to get the message across.,1229385600,,124,4.590909090909091
8297430,5,B001EAWMFG,"This film was hilarious and a great concept--especially because every guy has wondered it--""is every woman in my life in a huge conspiracy to destroy me??"" also for the ladies, it's hilarious to see a guy go crazy trying to figure it all out--haven't you wanted a jerk ex's life ruined and all other girls in his life to screw him over? there are a lot of interesting and funny characters to follow in the plot and some beautiful female actresses. the main guy is likeable enough to be interesting but annoying enough for you to laugh at his misery. the best part is the nursey scene played by an androgenous midget like character with 80's make up and sweats along with the big guy from Fridays with the crossed eye who in the scene has been so screwed over by women that he's absolutely crazy to the point of no return. i really enjoyed this movie--clearly a lot of time went into making it--very professional, yet it still has that wonderful, relatable, indie feel. you've got to check it out!!!",1226016000,3,998,4.519337016574585
8297431,5,B001EAWMFG,"Hot girls, wild and crazy characters & great dialogue. This is the kind of indie film that has a simple story that leaves you laughing while making you think. Mix some David Lynch, with some Farrelly Brothers, and add some old school 70's/80's style - Great cast of actors and new faces. Funny as hell!",1225238400,3,302,4.509090909090909
8297432,5,B001EAWMFG,"This movie was great.  The concept is just hilarious because I actually knew someone who went through a similar situation (a little less extreme though :-)  ).  Anyway, this film is definitely worth watching.",1224201600,,208,5.0588235294117645
