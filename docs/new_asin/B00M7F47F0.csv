6564395,4,B00M7F47F0,"I hope they do a proper transfer of Eyes Wide Shut. I was too young to see it theatrically, and have heard much
of its unique look. I understand it was quite grainy. Also, it would be nice to have the option to see the full screen versions of each movie.
Barry Lyndon presented at its proper aspect ratio would also be appreciated.
I may be wrong about this, but I think there is an error during the fade out in Full Metal Jacket, right where Joker covers his ears to block Pyle's screams. I don't think it is supposed to fade to solid black, I think it fades to a color that compliments the green that dominates the next shot. I understand that A Clockowrk Orange and The Shining have 4k transfers all ready to go, I hope they include them.
If all this is done, I will buy this set, even though I already have all the bluray's that are out. If not, then... there would be no point now would there?",1407196800,14,898,4.166666666666667

There's no need for this box set.

6564409,2,B00M7F47F0,"The wrong image format has the consequence that some sex and violence are no longer completely to see how that was still on the DVD box ""Stanley Kubrick Collection"" in 2001 the case!
Who owns this box or the individual DVDs this box, should keep this.
Now Warner Brothers had even promised never unadulterated almost bring Stanley Kubrick, his works the spectators, so this promise has been thrown overboard. The scenes which provoked Kubrick are in the 16: 9 versions hardly worth mentioning because of the scenes only half can be seen.
Also it is possible to defuse dramatic works!
Every true cineaste and Stanley Kubrick - historian knows that the Master never the aspect ratio of 1: 1.77 rounded 1: 1.78 (16: 9) has used for his works because he has worked with special lenses, lenses and camera angles, always a very different picture aspect ratio revealed to his vision to cater to the canvas!
Such rape in artworks Stanley Kubrick, I can not accept the direct comparison with the DVDs, the right (Barry Lyndon F.: 4: 3; The Shining F.: 4: 3) or optimized aspect ratio (Full Metal Jacket F. : 4: 3; Eyes Wide Shut F.: 4: 3 - without missing image content), was shocking!

Here are the facts with the correct image format that Kubrick took for these works (Source: cinematograph - Stanley Kubrick: Issue 19/2004):

Barry Lyndon: GB / USA 1975
F: 35 mm - 1: 1.66 (5: 3)

The Shining: GB / USA 1980
F: 35 mm - 1: 1.66 (5: 3)

Full Metal Jacket: GB / USA 1987
F: 35 mm - 1: 1.85 (37:20)

Eyes Wide Shut: GB / USA 1999
F: 35 mm - 1: 1.85 (37:20)

The Blu-ray - Box advertises also still with wrong aspect to the above mentioned four films.
All four works have the aspect ratio, according to the manufacturer, from 1: 1.85 (37:20), but the truth is that on the 1 all four films: 1.77 (16: 9) format have been cut, as there are no see bar at the bottom, top, left or right of the screen.
For all the love that's going too far!

Worth mentioning are the two Blu-rays with great bonus material accompanying book, the movies ""Lolita,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001"" In unprecedented image quality.
The aforementioned four films are curiously white in its aspect ratio.
What here Warner Home Video has concocted, probably only know the persons responsible for this box!

Conclusion: Those who can not do without the bonus material should purchase this box or complain to Warner Brothers.
Maybe the box is again revised and you can exchange the four Blu-rays! For example, in ""The Lord of the Rings - Box"" (Blu-ray) then it has also worked, as there was in the first edition so some technical flaws!",1431561600,10,2613,4.532908704883227

Hours of extras reveal the relationship that the director had with the cast and crew and how they were willing to go that extra mile for a cinematic genius. This is a definitive collection for any true cine-phile. It starts with Lolita from 1962 and ends with Eyes Wide Shut from 1999, which was Kubrick's last film. These comprise his last 8 films which to me are his true masterpieces, because he had complete autonomy over how they were made. He only made a total of 13 films in his lifetime with the addition of a few documentaries, yet there is so much to be gleaned from a Kubrick film. To study Kubrick is to study cinema.

As far as Spartacus, I could care less.

Each of his films became a world of its own, and he never revisited a world he had made. He's one of the few directors who has left us an entire solar system of films, each one unique, once and never again.",1408924800,7,420,4.134146341463414

6564422,3,B00M7F47F0,"There is a sleight of hand at play here and everyone who's up-in-arms over how much better the $50 Kubrick Collection is have taken the bait. Please note that as you're sending people your recommendation of the $50 Kubrick set, that isn't the ""Complete Collection"" to which you are referring. The ""Stanley Kubrick: Limited Edition"" set, now out-of-print, is the ONLY set that includes Spartacus. The $50 set DOES NOT include Spartacus nor Dr. Strangelove. It was repackaged to look exactly the same as the Limited Edition (See the attached photos. Note the two extra images in the Limited Edition). Assumedly, this repackaging occurred after Warner lost distributing rights to those two films. Whatever the case, this repackaging was clearly designed to trick you, and when you're writing that you get MORE out of that $50 set, well, you're giving false information. As I write this, the ""Limited Edition"" is listed from Amazon Marketplace sellers STARTING at $269 new and $140 used.

I definitely agree that this set bears too-hefty a price tag and that one extra movie doesn't justify the cost. But the fact is this: There isn't an all-encompassing option right now. In fact, there never was one to begin with. So all that being said, if you do not have the Limited Edition, this set DOES offer more the $50 set: Dr. Strangelove, three ""new"" extras, the book and the Mod repackaging, to be exact.  There's no sign of a Spartacus release and Strangelove is currently out-of-print as an individual disc. Come Christmastime, I would imagine this set will get deservingly whacked down to under $100.  Wait for the drop and purchase it then, because it's definitely worth that much. And quite honestly, I believe that this newer packaging will be better for the longevity of discs, as the Limited Edition's sleeves were horribly designed -- go read all the reviews on how many people scratched their discs just taking them out of the packaging.  I'll even admit, I avoid them because I'm too afraid I'll ruin the discs. That doesn't speak a great deal for the earlier packaging.

Bottom line: If you have these films on blu-ray, skip this set. Skip any set; you have them already! Why are you even here(myself included in that jab)?!  When the 4k discs with the all-new features that don't exist or the ""Actual Definitively Definitive Collection"" comes out, then buy THAT set. But if you don't have these films, this is a great collection and is better than the $50 set. Again, I would wait for the inevitable holiday season price drop or try your luck on the Amazon Market Place and find a used Limited Edition for roughly the same price as this  And definitely pick up the Criterion Collection discs of Paths of Glory and The Killing! You get Killer's Kiss as a bonus feature on The Killing and all three films are treated with such great care as per Criterion's standards. It would be an absolute shame to miss those titles, should they become out-of-print.  And I would say that, unless you're a completist, you can skip the recent Fear and Desire release. Not even Stanley would want you to spend your hard-earned cash on that.

If you do buy this set, PLEASE review it based on the actual set itself. I'm dying to see that book! Entice us skeptics!

--------------

UPDATE: By now, Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove have come out / been announced on Blu since this original review (STRANGELOVE ON CRITERION, NO LESS!!!) Clutter your shelf and get those releases, the $50 set, Paths of Glory and The Killing  That'll be roughly the cost of this set but you'll get 4 additional films(Counting Killer's Kiss on the The Killing disc)! If you're looking for guidance, that's your best / cheapest option.",1407888000,95,3697,4.786499215070644
6564423,1,B00M7F47F0,"As with many many other Kubrick fans I own the other set which as has been said includes both Spartacus and the unrated version (as Kubrick intended) of Eyes Wide Shut and therefore there is absolutely no need whatever to spend over a hundred dollars more for a collection that has less... Even if Spartacus wasn't one of my all time favorite films and even if I didn't already own the other set - the $50.00 price tag on the collection alone and the absolute stunning quality of the Blu-rays such as The Shining and A Clockwork Orange alone on the other set would be enough of a reason to ignore this ridiculous follow-up.
I also wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers here - if you buy the other set and then purchase the Criterion Editions of Paths of Glory and The Killing then you will indeed own the COMPLETE STALEY KUBRICK MASTERPIECE COLLECTION on Blu-ray ... think on this for less than the amount you spend on THIS set you would then have SPARTACUS included and then go on to purchase Paths of Glory and The Killing... Think about it. I know this is Amazon but two times a year Barnes & Noble has a half-off price sale on all their Criterion titles... in July and in November...
Personally I already own the other set plus the two Criterion titles but if you don't own any of them PLEASE DO NOT make the mistake of buying THIS SET!!!! Spend your money better and wisely. Get the other set now on Amazon for $49.31 plus FREE SHIPPING and then in November go strait to the Barnes & Noble site and order Paths of Glory and The Killing on Criterion for a mere $20.00 each!!!!!!!!!!
P.S. if you REALLY want to complete your Stanley Kubrick Collection buy both Fear and Desire on Blu-ray and Artificial Intelligence. Yes, Artificial Intelligence was directed by Steven Spielberg but it was developed by Stanley Kubrick and was intended to be his next film after Eyes Wide Shut and if you watch it and know Kubrick's work you will swear by Jesus that Spielberg was channeling Stanley Kubrick when filming it... it's a unique hybrid of a film part Steven Spielberg and part Stanley Kubrick and although it will never be on my top 100 films of all time that alone is worth owning it for especially if you want to be a Kubrick or Spielberg completest... or both!!!!!!!!!!
********** I'm amending this review though... I still say it's better to get the $50.00 set but I hadn't realized that the $50.00 was different from the Limited Edition Blu-ray that I had purchased 2 years ago... apparently the $50.00 set DOES NOT include Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove, and probably not the extra book too. I hadn't realized it was an ""Essentials"" set containing ONLY the WB films... you still have to buy Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove, The Killing and Paths of Glory separately... thank goodness I have the first set because it also looks like Dr. Strangelove is now out of print and costs $50-60 on it's own... can't really understand that one... but it would STILL be cheaper to buy the $50.00 set and then get Spartacus and The Killing and Paths of Glory than try and find Dr. Strangelove at a bargain somewhere... than buy the newest set! But I guess whatever works! Me I'm just happy that I have the Limited Edition set with everything plus The Killing and Paths of Glory on Criterion as well... oh well...",1407801600,14,3301,4.568296795952782
6564424,4,B00M7F47F0,"I was going to agree with the others that this box set seems to be way overpriced and suggest the Stanley Kubrick Limited Edition Collection, which has all the above movies AND Spartacus, which I got from Amazon in April 2012 for 59.99 which would make more sense, HOWEVER, that box set is now on Amazon for 269.99 so I guess this version is priced better and does include a 78 page book and three documentaries that were not on the Limited Edition box set that I have just referenced.

The title for this new box set says that it is an Amazon exclusive (Whatever that means. I guess it only is available on Amazon).  I agree that if Amazon is going to go through all the trouble of putting together a ""masterpiece"" collection that it should AT LEAST include Spartacus and Paths of Glory, as those should also be considered masterpieces.  Go figure.
