8240905,4,B00117TUY8,Outstanding performance from an outstanding singer. Once you've heard Linda Eder it will redefine how you judge the talent of a singer. I think she's amazing and criminally under-represented on homevideo. Why is this not available on DVD yet?,1373241600,,242,5.230769230769231
8240906,5,B00117TUY8,"It took time to come across this live performance; but I LOVE IT.  It is VHS so I converted it to DVD. Quality is okay, loses something in conversion but the performance is great. You just cannot go wrong with anything Linda Eder does. Well worth having in any LE collection.",1371081600,,275,4.392156862745098
8240907,5,B00117TUY8,"This is a wonderful concert....a great way to introduce people who do
not know Linda Eder to her unbelievable voice and talent. This needs to
be made available again and also put on to a DVD format.",1199577600,2,198,4.378378378378378
