8725544,5,B0128ETY5W,"Royal Opera House production of three of Puccini's most popular operas in one box set at a tremendous price. All of these are well done,but Tosca clearly stands out, with it's showstopping performances of Angela Gherghghiu (in her signature role) and Bryn Terfel, and the deliciously tragic story, this is my favourite  Puccini opera. La Boheme is very entertaining, and has fine production values and costumes as well. Turandot was slightly disappointing by comparison, the performances and story are well done, but odd artistic choices (like the strange masks) and a seemingly cramped set kept it from living up to my expectations. To be fair, Turandot, was always extremely grand in my imagination, probably due to the classic EMI recording with Birgit Nilsson and the extravagantly dressed Princess in flowing robes and ornate head-dress on the cover. Be that as it may, theses are all fine entertainment, and hopefully there are more sets like this to come, maybe with Madama Butterfly. On Blu ray this makes opera lovers feel like being at the theater and Opus Artes other opera box sets are are also completely recommended.",1528156800,,1130,5.075268817204301

TOSCA (5.0 stars)  2011
Angela Gheorghiu is Tosca. Jonas Kaufmann is Cavaradossi. Bryn Terfel is Scarpia. Antonio Pappano conducts. Jonathan Kent directs the stage. Near perfect singing and acting. Gheoghiu is slightly lacking in volume. Terfel's Scarpia is an uncouth monster.

TURANDOT (4.8 stars)  2013
Lise Lindstrom is Turandot. Marco Berti is Calaf. Eri Nakamura is Li. Henrik Nnsi conducts. Andrei Serban directs the stage. Excellent singing; mostly excellent acting. Berti but doesn't do much acting and almost never changes his expression.

8725552,2,B0128ETY5W,"The Tosca is sublime.

Berti is soooooooo bad on the Turandot, he is so musically unaware, pitchy and rushing.  One can only cringe so much.
He must get gigs through politics, he isn't getting them through musicality - surely all of the members of the ensemble and orchestra know it too.  He is garbage.  He is even worse on the met opera 2016 recording.  I am literally embarassed for him.",1468713600,3,390,4.514285714285714
