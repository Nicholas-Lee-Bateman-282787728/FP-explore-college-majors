8257107,5,B00151QYIK,"The pace of the plot definitely picks up with Volume 2 and many clues to the central plot are revealed; there are many intrigues afoot and not everything is as it appears at first.  The action is even more gripping as Volume 1, and everything takes on a much more serious tone.  Still, through the adversity, the emotional bonds of the trio of witches (Sheila, Eva, and the human Arusu) grow stronger in this volume.  Each of the girls find an inner strength which they use to endure the hardships they face.  There is even a hint given about Arusu's long lost father.

In some ways, the device of Magic versus High Tech is a bit cliched; Magic is extolled and High Tech typically denigrated as corrupting and evil.  I kind of prefer the way this is handled in Scrapped Princess, where ""Magic"" is apparently merely misunderstood Advanced technology that has been forgotten by a world that has reverted to the European Middle Ages.  In Tweeny Witches, both exist side by side.  Arusu remains firm in her conviction that ""magic creates miracles"", and once the viewer learns the scope of the impending doom facing the Magical Realm, one comes away hoping sincerely that Arusu is right, in spite of the apparent long odds.  There is also a little hint at romantic attraction between the renegade Warlock boy and Sheila; More him for her, but she doesn't outright reject him, either.  Sheila attempts to save Arusu from the coming Doom by drugging her and putting her on a ship bound for the human realm.  Arusu does appreciate the gesture, but is determined to stay and help her friends once she learns from the witch pirate Lennon that the Magical Realm is on a path to destruction.  Lennon is mysterious and she claims to be a ""mirror"" of Arusu.  It makes Arusu begin to think about the story Alice in Wonderland and how it relates a little to her own predicament.  ""Arusu"" is the Japanese pronunciation of the foreign name ""Alice"".

Arusu's annoying doctrinaire pacifism causes more problems than it solves...again; but Arusu does rise to the occasion to stand up to the pirate Lennon and save her witch friends from certain death by starvation (or having their ship sunk).  In the final episode, Arusu is disgusted by Alieta's use of a declaration of war to distract the people from the growing mounting ecological crises; Unhelpfully, the Warlocks choose this moment to launch a massive attack against the witches, and as the volume concludes, it seems all out war is almost inevitable.  Arusu perceives the senselessness of the conflict, but what can one do when war is virtually forced upon you by the opposing side?  Many mysteries remain to be solved and whet the viewer's appetite for Volume 3!",1229472000,,2700,4.745182012847966
8257108,4,B00151QYIK,"If you haven't seen the first DVD, be aware that I might mention some spoilers in this review. You have been warned!

In the previous DVD, Arusu, Sheila and Eva joined Sigma to find the warlocks' world. Sigma, however, also has ulterior motives to grab the magic book from them to give to the warlocks. The magical world is disappearing, and the magic book would give the warlocks the power of dark magic.

Sigma's technological underground home of metal, electronics and flying machines, is a culture shock. It's almost unfair that the warlocks have this much power. Sheila is awfully glum about the future of the witches' home, and whether Arusu is doing the right thing by saving fairies. Thus, Sheila sends Arusu on a ship to the human world. However, Arusu is in for a shock when she meets a pirate who claims that he is Arusu's mirror. For some reason, he has the book...

I kept most of the details pretty vague, but this series still has many questions to be answered. Arusu mentions the story of Alice, who travels to Wonderland through a magic mirror. Still, it must be strange for Arusu to deal with some guy who keeps saying that he's her mirror. But the emotional tension remains high in this anime, and that's a good thing.

I also enjoyed watching Sheila, who is (thank goodness) starting to question the authority of the warlocks and the witches. Sheila is also spying on her elder witches, to see who is double-crossing them.

And far more mysterious events occur as well. Witches suddenly die for causes that are completely unknown. And the warlocks take their biggest step to try and capture Arusu and the magic book.

This is one of the biggest sleeper hits of 2008. The series hasn't disappointed me yet. While this series is definitely more for kids, based on the storybook style colors and drawings, the action is still intense. There are plenty of magic battles in this volume. And the voice acting is incredible. In fact, there's even a special feature which shows that this is one of the first anime series in which the voice acting was performed before the animation. Maybe this is why the acting performances are so strong in this anime, compared to other anime series.

If you love shojo (girl's) anime, then you definitely cannot pass up on the Tweeny Witches (or Mahou no Shoujo Arusu in Japanese).

By the way, the other special feature shows the animation trailer for the series which they pitched to their producers and the trailer for the finished product. I'd have to say that the final product looks far better than their initial trailer.",1212105600,2,2575,4.694013303769402
8257109,5,B00151QYIK,"As the plot thickens I find myself loving this anime even more. With its unique visual style and fasinating take on magic. This is certainly one  anime to be seen by all who love fantasy. It has quickly become one of my all time favorites.

This disc set splits the episodes up between two discs just like the first set. The special features are located on the second disc. Which include test animation for series. It also includes trailers for Twelve Kingdoms, Twin Signal, GaoGaiGar, and Shinesman. Clicking on the witch emblem there is also a trailor for the upcoming events of Tweeny Witches. It looks very exciting and I look forward to seeing how the series progresses.",1210896000,,675,4.711864406779661
