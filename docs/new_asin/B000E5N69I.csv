2493897,4,B000E5N69I,It seems that Lions Gate cranks out a lot of bargain basement blockbuster wannabe films but this one stands out! I was riveted to the ingenius plot from the start and could not put his movie down! The writers appear to be of a good calibre for a low budget picture and as a result I was glued to my seat to the very end! A lot of indy DVDs put a nice picture on their covers and claim to have an interesting premise but fail to deliver but this one is the real deal- no smoke and mirrors or bad acting here despite the fact that these actors are relatively unknowns! A Lover's Revenge just might be a sleeper hit and people need to wake up and realize that all independent films are not created equal! Rent this DVD- you won't regret it!,1152144000,11,737,4.125

8106071,3,B000E5N69I,"This was alright.  Nothing special, but worth watching if you like thrillers.  The plot wasen't too original, a type of revenage movie.  If you have nothing better to do then its alright seeing it.",1235520000,5,197,4.735294117647059
8106072,5,B000E5N69I,"It's true the acting and casting was superb in this outstanding production.  This really does stick out as being an outstanding made for TV movie.  Few catch my attention these days like this one did.  The plot is about a psychologist radio talk show host who attracts the attention of the murderer of one of her callers she had given advice to. He forms a plot to get into her life to destroy her after believing she influenced his wife to try and break free causing her to get into fatal accident.  William Moses proves himself an impressive outstanding and seasoned actor. Keep your eyes on Moses, this guy is really convincingly psycho.  He's been around since the early 80's and has the evil lover revenge thing down to the tee.  As for Alexandra Paul the psychologist, she was just as good as all the other women in the case.  They were all excellent in this film. Excellent screenplay.",1199923200,19,892,4.572327044025157
8106073,3,B000E5N69I,"Somewhat predictable and some bad acting by the husband (Rob).  Overall it was okay for a 'B' movie.

Some of you may remember Alexandra Paul who played on Baywatch, now she did deliver...job well done.  Oh yeah, the 'lover' was a hottie also.

Rent it, but don't spend alot to buy it.",1193616000,6,285,4.423076923076923
