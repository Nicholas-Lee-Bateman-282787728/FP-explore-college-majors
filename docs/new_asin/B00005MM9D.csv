7945964,5,B00005MM9D,"My lil guys favorite 'Franklin' show by far! And a holiday favorite we watch every year now. We discovered this when my son was 3 yrs old, and he really enjoyed it, even though we didn't know the Franklin show very well. Now at 6 yrs old, he still enjoys it very much, and as a mom I've enjoyed it a lot too. It's about working together as a family, loving your siblings and the fun, magical parts of Christmas! The colorful, soft, good ol' cartoon animation (not computer generated) gives it an even warmer holiday feel. The storyline is perfect for any age, boys or girls, with no scary parts or scary characters. It will quickly become a holiday favorite your family can watch year after year.",1439856000,,696,4.4453125

7945966,5,B00005MM9D,"I absolutely love this DVD.  Since Franklin aired on TV, I always allowed my kids to watxh it.  Franklin teaches kids morals and life lessons, but is not boring unlike some other shows are.  I also enjoy watching as well.  This is a great heartfelt story, and have watched it over and over with my kids.  I urge you, that if you buy just one Franklin movie, that you buy this one.  Its better than the other movies.",1230422400,,415,4.256410256410256
7945967,4,B00005MM9D,"Franklin's Magic Christmas was a delight to watch with my three year old daughter.  The story kept her interest and had a ""magical"" feel.  She requests to watch it again, and again.  A sure sign of a winner!",1009497600,7,207,4.394736842105263
7945968,1,B00005MM9D,"Bah!  Humbug!  Sure the exterior box is slick and the product was promoted well, but the manufacturer chose to release the title in SLP rather than Standard Play!  Thus, the viewer, unless he has a much higher quality VCR than I do, is guaranteed a grainy picture.  Please adjust tracking now!!!  Right!!  The few additional cents it would have cost to produce the video better, apparently were funneled into the profit sheets. (In additional, the cassette was produced with an opaque black lid, so you cannot tell if your offspring rewound it, without putting in the the VCR.)  If you must see this insignificant symbol of corporate greed, rent it.",1008201600,4,649,4.845454545454546
