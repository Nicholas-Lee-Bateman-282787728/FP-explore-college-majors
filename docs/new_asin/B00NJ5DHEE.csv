Refreshing to have a film remind us who we are supposed to be as humans. You need to see this film, it will change your life!",1411862400,,291,4.12280701754386
6661462,5,B00NJ5DHEE,"The Only Oly is a touching story of how one person can make a difference in the world, but you have to be different to make the difference. Immediately, you fall in love with the main character, Spencer, and relate to everything he goes through. It's an emotional story with a positive message that everyone needs to be reminded of. I would reccomend this movie to anyone, young to old and single person to large families. It's definitely worth the watch and will leave a lasting impression on you.",1411689600,,498,4.606741573033708

6661466,4,B00NJ5DHEE,"As a book-reader, I consider movies a waste of time. Even those I truly enjoy cause a tinge of conscience because the time could be better spent learning something worthwhile.  'The Only Oly' re-teaches something unquestionably worthwhile: civilization.
Movies featuring individuals or families blessed with abundant (and unrealistic) resources and whose heroes and heroines perform fantastic feats are exceedingly common; this alone makes 'The Only Oly' stand out.  As I write this review, my pay cuts and years of denied raises meant that family could buy no groceries this week.  This is reality, and the movie family shares my challenges, and they respond exactly as many families do each day.  The characters are well-developed and quite believable because of these realities.
Even minor characters' brief appearances mirror well those all-too-frequent one-dimensional people that we all experience every day.  The core of any story is conflict, and this story's conflict is no more or no less than any other story.  Its difference compared to much of today's fare is a combination of its believability and the equal believability of its characters.  The acting is quite . . . well . . . worthwhile.  This movie was filmed not in a glitzy metropolis, but an aging Oklahoma town that could be almost anywhere.  Therein is its strength.  Since it could be almost anywhere, the issues addressed are those that affect almost everyone.  Rent it or buy it, if your budget can possibly allow.  Its marvelous blend of emotion and thought is a welcome change in movie fare!",1411257600,3,1569,5.109803921568627
