8758967,5,B01EK3ZHG4,"This is a lovely first DVD offering from Kundalini yogini Maria Gancheva.  I have  been following Mariya's 40 Day Kundalini Lounge Weight Loss challenge and look forward to starting every day with her practices.  Some are more strenuous than others.  In this DVD, Mariya provides us with a doable, enjoyable hour of kriya and meditations to sooth and detox.  I understand that more DVDs will be forthcoming from Mariya, and I will purchase every one.  The production qualities, music and teaching are top notch.  I also love Mariya's outfits and appreciate that she does not present in an ""other worldly"" manner in white robes, turbans, etc.

This DVD does not have a matrix function, similar to which Ravi and Ana offer on their DVDs; however, the sequences flow nicely and are chaptered so you can easily skip through meditations toward the end, should you desire a shorter routine.

I confess to being puzzled over one reviewer describing her as snobbish.  I find Mariya to be down to earth, kindly and sweet, as someone who wants us genuinely to succeed.  I also enjoy her adorable accent. Thank you for this practice, Mariya.",1474243200,7,1130,4.863874345549738
8758968,1,B01EK3ZHG4,Probably the worst kundalini yoga DVD I ever bought.,1473379200,,52,4.888888888888889
8758969,5,B01EK3ZHG4,Excellent variation of kundalini yoga.  Quiets the mind and leads you to focus inward as well as stretching and strengthening the body.  One of the best produced yoga videos I've seen.  Will watch again and again.  Hope to see more from Kundalini Lounge.,1469664000,6,254,4.837209302325581
8758970,4,B01EK3ZHG4,"Pros: Lovely music, background, atmosphere, high-quality video.
Cons: guru looks bored/annoyed. This video is for advanced practitioners. Not always clear on the instructions or evenly paced-she seems to want to remain superior to the viewer and enjoys ""showing off"" her prowess.
That said, it only makes me want to perfect even more.
The high-quality, expensive feel of the video (not many on the market) will make me buy again.",1469491200,5,429,5.231884057971015
8758971,5,B01EK3ZHG4,"Mariya does a great job on this yoga DVD.  Its a gentle routine guided effortlessly by this experienced certified kundalini teacher. I would recommend it for a friend- anyone looking to go deeper into the healing benefits of Kundalini should buy this DVD.

The production quality is fantastic, the music and instruction are great!  The mood is relaxing and peaceful.",1467158400,5,366,5.066666666666666
8758972,5,B01EK3ZHG4,"This is a wonderful hour of yoga that will provide so many benefits for beginners as well as those with experience in kundalini yoga.  The instructor eases you into the techniques at a slow pace but many poses can be difficult if held long enough.  I am new to this and had to go at my own pace so used the pause button a lot (on streaming).  I chose this particular DVD because of the other positive reviews and because after watching on Prime for 30 seconds I knew that it would be a great mix between relaxing and working out.

--You won't be intimidated by yoga with this DVD!
--Mariya eases you into the techniques
--Available on DVD or Prime streaming
--Great for all levels
--Can ease back and muscular pain but also great for overall well-being and relaxation",1465948800,8,767,4.457142857142857
