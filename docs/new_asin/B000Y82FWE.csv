3013565,5,B000Y82FWE,"My mother and I used to watch this movie at least once a year, but since I've moved away to college, we've not been able to do our yearly tradition. Thank goodness I got the idea of looking for this movie, and thank god for this seller--they were the only one I could find that had the movie available. I decided to wait and give it to her as a Christmas present and gladly so. My mom was beyond excited and even cried when she saw what the DVD was. We spent the rest of Christmas night laughing, crying and really enjoying the memories the film reminded us of. It has definitely been the best gift I have given so far.",1326153600,4,619,4.12396694214876
3013566,5,B000Y82FWE,"I watched this movie as a little girl and loved it. I use to make my parents rent it week after week at our local video store. When I visited my grandparents in mexico it use to come on regular television. I never got tired of watching it. I couldn't believe when I found it on here now twenty years later. When it arrived I immediately watched it with my mother.

Great tender movie about the relationship of a boy of poor origins and his grandfather. The little boy helps his grandfather set traps for birds in the woods, to then later sell them in the streets of a small town in Mexico. The story however, takes a sharp turn, when his grandfather is imprisoned for allegedly stealing from a local woman. The boy is sent to an orphanarium and gets to talk to his grandpa by the window that faces his cell with the street, those times when he manages to escape from his own. His grandfather, now knowing what it feels like to be deprived from his freedom, asks his grandson to let all their birds free, and never set traps for them again. Very sad, but nice story.",1323734400,4,1065,4.298507462686567
