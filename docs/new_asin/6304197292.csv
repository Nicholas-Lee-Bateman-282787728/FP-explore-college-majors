7865218,3,6304197292,"Unfortunately Gracie Allen and Bob Burns part is the sub plot of this story. The main story is good but I wish it had been switched. Dixie Lee (Mrs. Bing Crosby) has a nice voice and a good presence. It's a shame this is the only movie with her in print. She plays a girl who has dreams of stardom only they go nowhere. Luckily she meets a struggling songwriter and the two find work together at a music shop and love. But she feels bad about her vaudeville past and doesn't feel worthy to him. Gracie and Bob track her down, members of her past vaudeville act. There is a classic scene where Gracie gets out of a ticket.",1081728000,3,621,4.183333333333334
