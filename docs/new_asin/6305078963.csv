Man, oh, man! David Hand did an amazing job creating and producing the eye-catching and sweet Animaland cartoons overseas in England! I can totally see his Disney training and style shining through in every single animated frame of film...although it is mixed in with some Looney Tunes and Walter Lantz cartoon styles as well. And that's not by coincidence or by random chance either! David Hand worked with, studied with, and collaborated with some of the best and some of the brightest within the cartoon/animation business back in the 1930's, including the iconic Max Fleischer (Popeye cartoons)!

I really got a big kick out of David Hand's biography as well. Never knew that he worked on all those old great Mickey Mouse cartoons and that David Hand was the Supervising Director overseeing the entire production of Disney's Snow White and Bambi feature film releases and that he was second in command and only answerable to Mr. Walt Disney himself!

Me, personally? If I was at Disney and was Walt Disney's right Hand man (LOL, bad comedic pun, I know...), I would not have left Disney's empire. I would have stayed and drawn and directed cartoons until Walt Disney retired me or moved me up into another creative position at Disney. I mean, why move to England and start all over again? And the answer comes from the biography: a huge overseas movie company  is going to give me more money and will give me my own cartoon studio to run and manage however I see fit. ...So, yeah, I can sort of get David Hand leaving Disney under those reasons.

All in all, though, I was truly blown away by how really fun and entertaining these 9 cartoons from Mr. David Hand's brilliant technicolor mind are! I'm hoping that Mr. Hand worked on more cartoons than these and that someone will discover them and that there will be even more Animaland DVD volumes to come. If not, and these are all the David Hand cartoons that there ever will be, I'll still pull this DVD out from time to time. You know, just to ponder what could have been.

However, without a shadow of a doubt, David Hand's fantastic body of work and his pivotal legacy to the exciting world of animation lives on! Ya' feel me?",1507420800,,2408,4.654117647058824
7882797,5,6305078963,"This is the sweetest collection of old cartoons my kids & I have ever seen.  Been searching for a copy of our own ever since the libraries copy became worn out.  They are too old for cartoons now, but we all still enjoy it very much!",1235692800,,233,4.043478260869565
7882798,5,6305078963,"A film archivist in Burbank, California named Ken Kramer bought several reels of movie film, paying $50 to the guy who was selling them just to get rid of him. The haul was mostly movie trailers. Then, he struck pure cinematic gold. Four of the reels contained a series of theatrical cartoons that were thought to have been lost forever. The 9 cartoons had the look and feel of vintage 1940s Disney with a liberal splash of Looney Tunes lunacy. Each was identified as ""A David Hand ANIMALAND Cartoon"".

A phone call to Leonard Maltin revealed David Hand to be the same David Hand who was Walt Disney's supervising director of the animated features ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Bambi"". After progressing as far as he could in the enforced anonymity of the Disney studios, Hand was lured to England by J. Arthur Rank to establish a similar animation studio on the British Isles. The ""Animaland"" cartoons were released theatrically in Europe but could never find an American distributor, possibly because of pressure from Warner Bros., MGM, Columbia Pictures and Hand's former employer, one Walter Elias Disney, all of whom had their own thriving animation divisions.

When the Rank Organisation closed Hand's studio, the fate of the ""Animaland"" cartoons remained a mystery for the past 50 years. Hand returned to the USA and turned his back on animation. He spent most of the rest of his career producing industrial training films. In Europe, 4 ""Animaland"" cartoons eventually turned up and were released on home video overseas. They were thought to be the ONLY extant specimens.

Flash forward to Ken Kramer's incredible find. The 9 cartoons are, to date, the biggest collection from the series. The good news is that David Hand's son, David Hale Hand, agreed to their release on home video in the USA. Since David Hale Hand owns the American rights to his father's work, there are even plans for an animated feature film starring the cast of the ""Animland"" cartoons.

Many of the cartoons feature Ginger Nutt, a fiery red squirrel who's easily as cute as Thumper the rabbit from ""Bambi"" but can be intimidating enough to fend off the 3 forest troublemakers Corny Crow, Dusty Mole and Loopy Hare. Ginger Nutt's love interest is a female squirrel named Hazel. The rest of the cartoons are one-shots with obbligatory production numbers about such species as the cuckoo, the duck-billed platypus, the ostrich, the lion and the house cat.

Anyone who enjoys classic Disney and Warner animation won't be able to stop watching these cartoons. They offer a glimpse into another cartoon world located somewhere between Disney's unrelenting cuteness and Warner Bros. Looney Tune madness. There's also a sense of sadness of what might have been, had David Hand been able to continue the series.

Thanks to this collection, Animaland will always be around, waiting for animation aficionados to pay a visit.",1195948800,4,2904,4.965020576131687
7882799,5,6305078963,"I first saw some of Hand's ""Animaland"" cartoons on a classic cartoon program that airs on cable every Saturday morning, and was completely enchanted.  Apparently, Hand had worked for Disney, and when he went out on his own, the wonderful feature cartoons he created were not shown in the U.S., although popular in his native England.  (My assumption is that megalomaniac Disney had a hand -- no pun intended -- in that.)  Some of these beautiful cartoons were lost for over 50 years.  Now that they have been rediscovered, ""Animaland"" and its creator will receive, albeit very late, the veneration in the U.S. that they and he so richly deserve...at least that's my hope.

If you are a fan of ""Bambi""-era Disney cartoons (Hand was supervising director on ""Bambi""), pop in this DVD, sit back, and enjoy Ginger Nutt and his friends...and hearken back to a more innocent time.

There is a brief biography of Hand included on the DVD;  I'll admit that, in my hurry to rave over ""Animaland,"" I've not yet watched it.  So if any of my information about Hand is incorrect, I apologize...and will correct it soon enough!",1191801600,2,1112,4.755208333333333
7882800,4,6305078963,"David Hand's Animaland cartoons are an interesting historical oddity with a lot going for them despite their problems. Part of the Rank Organisation's attempts to build a post-war British film empire when the UK briefly banned all American films in 1948 to boost the local industry (which explains the proud boast `Made in Cookham-on-Thames' on the end credits), they boast some fine animation but fall down on plot and characters. Somehow occasional stars red squirrel Ginger Nutt and his girlfriend seem such close relatives to Chip `n' Dale and Thumper that the very, very well spoken received English pronunciation just seems plain wrong. Ginger's also not a particularly memorable character, so the cartoons that rely more on spot gags than plots fare better. But the animation is certainly lavish, as you might expect from the director of Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Before UPA introduced the minimalist/economy of line concept that would lead to TV's limited animation techniques, these boast detailed backgrounds and rich, warm colors (even though the DVD transfers are clearly - albeit understandably - a few generations away from the originals). Nearly all of them have something going for them: The Cuckoo boasts a wondrously vivid dream sequence in monochromatic color that's a close cousin to Dumbo's `Elephants on Parade', The Ostrich finds itself falling in love with and becoming a hieroglyphic, 'The Platypus' has some wonderful animation in and under a stream and in 'The House Cat' a kitten's imagination turns a curtain ring into a tiny man in a bath-towel to torment. Probably more for animation aficionados than general audiences, but certainly of interest.",1157760000,4,1695,5.231617647058823

7882802,5,6305078963,"Animaland is an exceptionally clever and enjoyable collection of cartoon shorts, with the unique ability to keep the attention of both children and adults. David Hand and his production team did not simply mimic the style of Disney's cartoons, but tried to push the envelope, developing clever plots, strange characters, and sometimes surreal settings. Most of the shorts are fast-paced action stories, with minimal dialog. When the characters do speak, they often have British accents. Some of the shorts are introduced by an off-screen British narrator, who, parodying instructional nature films, gives ""scientific"" information about the lead animal. The original music is catchy, perfectly timed with the visuals, and provides good instrumental sound effects. The animation is sophisticated, as we'd expect from Hand's reputation as a key Disney animation director. My favorite is ""The Ostrich"" in which a male Ostrich steps into a two-dimensional Egyptian Hieroglyphic to pursue a female Ostrich. The vocal lyrics to that segment are hilarious, and the animation mesmerizing.
A few comments on the reviews below. Comparisons with Disney characters are misleading; Animaland characters have personalities of their own - often very British. The audio to the DVD is fabulous in view of the date of the source material. Yes, the cartoons are charming and comparatively wholesome, but we're not talking Teletubbies here. The two words I'd use are ""zany"" and ""intelligent"".",1033862400,8,1471,5.513274336283186
