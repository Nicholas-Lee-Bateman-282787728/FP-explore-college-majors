WWE Championship Match

Edge (c) vs. John Cena vs. Triple H (fans' choice)

This will be a great match just like it was at Backlash back in April. I'm expecting ""The Rated-R Superstar"" to retain the WWE Championship here. I was reading some spoilers and it said that Cena was going to win the title at SummerSlam, but Edge was going to win the title back at Unforgiven in a brutal TLC Match. It also said the that around November, Edge would have the title. Edge is scheduled to lose the belt at the Royal Rumble to Triple H.",1155340800,,615,4.398230088495575
2629128,3,B000H6SXWE,"THIS WAS A VERY WEIRD PPV BECAUSE OF THE MAIN EVENT AND THE MATCHIES ON THE CARD SEEMED MORE LIKE RAW MATCHIES HERES THE CARD

UMAGA vs KANE

THIS WAS DECENT I THOUGH KANE WAS GOING TO WIN AT FIRST BUT OH WELL 7/10

6 MAN TAG TEAM TORNADO MATCH

MURDOCH & CADE vs CRYME TYME vs CHARLIE HASS & VISSARA vs THE HIGHLANDERS

INTERCONIL CHAMPIONSHIP

JEFF HARDY champ vs CARLITO

I DID NOT VOTE FOR CARLITO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SELTON BENJAMIN THE PERSON I VOTED FOR WOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER MATCH WITH JEFF HARDY BUT WHAT WE GOT WAS SOME GOOD ACTION KINDA BORING IN THE MIDDLE BUT IT PICKED UP ALOT IN THE END CARLITO NEEDS TO STOP FLYING AROUND THE RING SO MUCH AS YOU SEE IT IS COSTING HIM MATCHIES 7.5/10

TAG TEAM MATCH

D-X vs EDGE & RANDY ORTON

I REALLY DON'T CARE FOR DX THAT MUCH SMIPLY BECAUSE THEIR TOO OLD AND THEY HAVE DONE WAYYY TO MUCH IN THEIR CARRERS TO BE ACTING LIKE 16 YEAR OLDS I LIKED BETTER WHEN TRIPLE H WAS THE BAD GUY AND SHAWN MICHAELS WAS THE GOOD GUY SO TO THE MATCH GOOD OLD 1980S STYLE TAG MATCH COULD HAVE BEEN LONGER AND BETTER BUT STILL VERY GOOD 8.5/10

WOMENS CHAMPIONSHIP

LITA vs MICKEY JAMES

THIS MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER THAN THIS I MEAN THE FANS PICKED A LUMBERJACK MATCH I PICKED NO DQ MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT BOTH WOMEN CAN REALLY WRESTLE SO IT WAS VERY DISSAPOINTING 5.5/10

WORLD TAG TEAM MATCH

THE SPIRIT SQUAD vs RIC FLAIR & ROWDY RODDY PIPER

FIRST OFF THE MATCH IS PRETTY BORING AND RIC & ROWDY WHERE GREAT IN THEIR DAY FLAIR IS 57 YEARS OLD SO WHEN HE WON HIS FIRST WORLD TILE HE WAS ABOUT 32 AND THAT WAS IN 1981 SO THAT TELLS YOU HOW OLD HE IS RIGHT THEIR PIPER IS UP THEIR TO AND KENNY FROM THE SPIRIT SQUAD IS WHAT 20 SO IN THAT CASE RIC FLAIR IS 37 YEARS OLDER THAN KENNY ANY WAY BORING MATCH 6/10

CHAMPIONS OF CHAMPIONS MATCH

OK WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS MATCH IT WAS GOING PRETTY WELL INTILL SOMETHING I DID NOT LIKE HAPPENED BIG SHOW WAS OUT FOR BASICLEY THE REST OT THE MATCH AFTER GETING KNOCK OUT ON THE FLOOR THEN I DID NOT LIKE THE ENDING AT ALL BUT IS WAS OK NOTHING REALLY MAIN EVENT WORTHY 8/10

OVERALL THIS PPV KINDA SUCKED THEIR WERE A FEW GOOD MATCHIES BUT THE MAIN EVENT DID NOT HAVE THAT MAIN EVENT FEEL TO IT THE PPV IS MORE A RENTING MOVIE THAN ANYTHING LIKE OWNING BUT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD RENT BEFORE BUYING TO SEE IF IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY",1165190400,,2516,3.9820359281437128
2629129,3,B000H6SXWE,"1. Kane vs. Umaga- I was hoping for a little bit better of a match from these two but I felt not much better. A lot vetter than there unforgiven match but could have done better. It was still decent but seemed more like a filler to me. A lot of big man action here but there was no dumb ending nice and clean so when all is said and done not a bad match. Winner Umaga. Match Rating 6.5/10.

2. Cryme Time vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Merdoch vs. Charlie Hass and Vicsera vs. the highlanders- This seemed like another filler to me. I would have rather had a nice one on one match for a number one contender but this turned out to be a mess. About a 6 minute match which was the right time. Cryme tie won which was good but not that good of a match. Winner Cryme Time. Match Rating 5/10.

3. Jeff Hardy vs. Carlito for the itc title- This match winner was predictable and I

Have gone with Shelton but carlito but on a strong match hear. This was the first good match of the night as there was a lot of nice high flying moves including a drop kick in mid air to Jeff Hardy. Slowed down a litlle bit but there were a lot of near falls where I accaulty thought that carlito was going to win the title. Nice match. Winner and still ITC champ Jeff Hardy. Match Rating 7.5/10.

4. DX vs. Edge and Randy Orton- This was a good match. Not as good as I thought it was going to be but still a very good match. I liked the fact the bishoff was the ref as it surprised me when he turned heel. It was for the most part just a soild wrestling match about 18 minutes but a lot of it was controlled by edge and orton. Things got interesting when edge speared bishoff. Bishoff ended screwing DX out of the match and michales went after him and edge came out of knowere with a sick chair shot to the head. Another sick shot by orton to the back of HHH and a beautiful RKO on the chair finsished it. Winners Edge and Randy Orton. Match rating 8/10.

5. Lita vs. Mickie James for the wwe womens title- This is not what you are expecting form these two. I think it had to do with the lumberjack rule. The match seemd to drag as I could not get into it at all but the next time I think these two could do a lot better. Winner and new wwe womens champ Lita. Match Rating 5/10.

6. The spirt swuad vs. Rick Flair and Rowdy Rowdy Piper for the world tag team titles- This match also did not seem to click for me. Maybe it was because we had two people who were almost 60 years old and a tag team champs that have been being squashed by every tag team there is. Overall it turned out to be better than I thought. I could see how it made sense in a way to put the titles on flair and piper but at the same itme I do not think it was the right call. Winners and new wwe tag team champs Rick Flair and Rowdy Rowdy Piper. Match Rating 6/10.

7. Booker T vs. John Cena vs. Bug Show for the WHT- This was a good main event. No were near last years main event tripke threat but still a unique idea. The only bad part about the match was it was very predictable who was going to win the match once they decided whose title was going to be on the line. It started oyut good with all three of the people in the match but the one part that I did not like about this match was it was mnore one on one action because big show fell on steel steps and he sold it like he was out for 10 minutes. Good near falls but K-Fed screws cena. Winner and still WHC King Booker. Match Rating 8/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Cyber Sunday 2006 a grade of 46/70 which is a 66% barley making this a good ppv. I would say this had way to many fillers and I could not get into this match at all. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreictae that. Thanks for your time.",1163462400,6,3746,3.9262187088274043
2629130,3,B000H6SXWE,"WWE Cyber Sunday seemed almost like a three hour Raw episode instead of a real ppv, which is a surprise since Raw had been on a role with their own ppvs. Although the main event was passible, and the DX/Orton,Edge match was good as well, most of the matches were short and not as exciting as they could have been. Fans of John Cena or DX will not like the ending of their matches, just to warn you....

Umaga vs. Kane:
The choices people could choose were Chris Benoit, The Sandman, and Kane. Kane won with nearly 50% and the match began. A lot of power moves as Kane repeatedly punched Umaga in a corner at one point. They fought outside the ring and Umaga at one point missed a clothesline and hit the ringpost. Back in the ring Kane was on the top turnbuckle and Armando Alejandro Estrada tried to distract Kane, but Kane pushed him off and jumped off the turnbuckle right into a Samoan Spike. Umaga hit a second Samoan Spike and got the pin. 7.5/10 [Okay match, but I thought Benoit would get the vote]

Texas Tornado Tag Team Match
Cryme Tyme vs. Lance Cade/Trevor Murdoch vs. Viscera/Charlie Hass vs. The Highlanders:
Wild brawl from start to finish, which is what the crowd wanted it seemed. Short match and there was way too much action to call. At one point Viscera/Hass had the upper hand, but then the highlanders came in. But at the last minute Cryme Tyme came in, took out Robbie of the highlanders, and got the pin. 5/10 [Way too short, only 5 minutes or so.]

Intercontinental Championship
Carlito vs. Jeff Hardy [Champion]:
Carlito won with over 60% of the vote. Pretty good match between these two, but at one point the crowd started chanting, ""boring"" for all the bear hugs Carlito kept doing. A lot of back and forth action, and at one point Carlito and did a series of moonsaults and covers, but Jeff kept kicking out. At the end of the match both were on the same top turnbuckle, but Carlito got knocked off and Jeff hit his Swanton Bomb for the win. 8/10 [Besides the boring chants this match was decent.]

DX vs. Edge and Randy Orton
Special guest referee - Eric Bischoff:
DX came to the ring and really took a long, long time to talk to the crowd. Eric won the voting and came down, then Edge/Orton with lita came down as well. The match was good since all four men are very solid wrestlers. At one point very early in the match HBK went for a sunset flip and pulled Edge's pants down so he mooned the crowd! As it was expected, Bischoff was in favor for Edge/Orton so he allowed of double teaming and when Shawn got crotched on the ropes Bischoff said he didn't see anything. Near the end of the match Edge accidentally speared Bischoff and a second ref had to come down to the ring, but Bischoff pulled him out of the ring during a count on Orton. Edge then blasted Michales with a chair, and Orton hit HHH with a steel chair in plain view of Bischoff, and got the win after Bischoff counted to three. 8.5/10 [At least they saved some credibility Edge and Orton had as a team. A very solid tag team match.]

Women's Championship Tournament Finals
Diva Lumberjack Match
Mickie James vs. Lita:
Both women threw each other out of the ring and women from ECW, Raw, and Smackdown threw them back in. There was actually a few botched spots between the two, which was a surprise since both are really good women's wrestlers. Anyway a few moves here and there, and at one point both fall out of the ring and a swarm of women attack them and throw them back in. Lita eventually got the win after Mickie was distracted by Victoria. 6.5/10 [Not a very good match, seemed rushed and way too short]

World Tag Team Championships
The Spirit Squad [Champions] vs. Ric Flair and Roddy Piper:
This was okay to see the old legends get one last run with some gold. I can't remember the last time Piper had a tag team championship over his shoulder. Short match again, and Flair made Mikey tap out to the Figure Four Leglock as Piper took Kenny out. 6/10 [finally the spirit squad lost their titles, they've had them since April!!!]

Champion of Champions Match
World Heavyweight Championship on the line
The Big Show [ECW] vs. Booker T [Smackdown] vs. John Cena [Raw]:
This match had no disqualifications or countouts since it was a triple threat match. At one point Big Show had the steel steps and tried to take Cena out, but Cena hit Show's knees and Show fell face first into his own steps! The fight continues and at one point Cena takes out Show and Booker and Sharmell runs in but gets an FU for her troubles. As the ref tends to Sharmell, Kevin Federline of all people runs in and hits Cena with the championship belt. Booker T recovers and pins Cena to retain his title. 8/10

WWE Cyber Sunday is not one of the best ppvs of the year. Most of the matches were less than 10 minutes and none were all that good. However I will still recommend this to rent and watch for the DX/Orton, Edge match, The main event, and even the IC title match. However it seems sad that the WWE creative team has to resort to using Kevin Federline to get ratings in.",1162771200,6,5060,4.392742796157951
2629131,5,B000H6SXWE,"WWE is losing and losing superstars day by day, they are losing great ones, they lost so many superstars that i cant even count. And who do they lose it to? TNA, their competition

the reason for that is because Vince McManhon is stupid like sshh t

the main reason the superstars left WWE is probably because of low salary, or not as high as TNA would offer

i feel really bad for the WWE because im a huge fan of WWE and it sucks to see Christy Hemme, Sting, Christian, Kurt Angle, Trish Stratus left WWE and came to TNA and sure more leaving on the future

8136975,4,B000H6SXWE,"Taboo Tuesday or Cyber Sunday--I guess no one cares what day it is. In any event, a good show. I guess many people in the world of wrestling have had unbeatable streaks--especially if you're being pushed as an unstoppable heel. I know Kane has been there, so no big shakes if he lost to Umaga.

I guess the biggest draw for this event was ""Champion of Champions,"" pitting all the champs from each show against each other. Good thing King Booker won or the Big Gold would have gone to that cesspool EC-dub. Pretty good match for the Women's title, too. Some funny backstage skits--don't know if it was DX or the 2 World Champs, but they were funny.

Overall, a pretty good show if you like professional wrestling...",1523404800,,714,4.5271317829457365

CYBER SUNDAY 2006

At this event the fans voted on all kinds of things from matches to opponents. So the power was with the fans on this night every year.

1. UMAGA VS KANE-it was kind of a no brainer who the fans were going to vote for here. Kane had had problems with Umaga and was also the closest to beating him. So Kane was chosen as Umagas next opponent. The match was a good big guy versus big guy bout with momentum switching at different times. Still in the end Umaga remains undefeated.

2.[TEXAS TORNADO MATCH]CRYME TYME VS THE HIGHLANDERS VS LANCE CADE AND TREVOR MURDOCK VS CHARLIE HASS AND VICERA-naturally with four teams all going at it at the same time this was a fun match. The action was fast paced with each team getting in moments and spots. The match was shorter than I thought it should have been with Cryme Tyme coming out on top. They also steal Lawlers laptop after the match.

3.[I-C TITLE]JEFF HARDY VS CARLITO-this match was much better than it was given credit for. Hardy lets loose with his quicker style while Carlito tries to ground him. The fans aren't into this one as much but I thought it was a good match. Hardy keeps the title after a few near falls, still wish Carlito won this match.

4. DX VS RATED RKO-Randy and Edge blamed DX for all their troubles and fallers so this match was put together. The fans voted for Eric Bischoff as the special referee and up until the end he was doing a good job. DX of course worked well together here but Edge and Orton were just as good controlling a good portion of the match. Thanks to Eric the get the win here and it was a big one.

5.[DIVAS TITLE LUMBERJILL MATCH]MICKEY JAMES VS LITA-this match was a good one between two of the best even though I don't like Lita. Good back and forth action with all of the other Divas on the outside. Lita ends up getting the title here.

6.[TAG TITLES]SPIRIT SQUAD VS RODDY PIPER AND RIC FLAIR-the youngsters versus the legends in this match right here. Two of the greatest of all time take on the Squad with the tag belts on the line. The action is what you would expect from this match. The legends take the tag titles here in something special for them and the fans.

7.[WORLD TITLE]BOOKER T VS JOHN CENA VS THE BIG SHOW-in this triple threat match the fans voted for whose title would be on the line. In the end they decided Bookers World title should be the one. This was a fun match in which Show demonstrated his strength although he was out of the match for a while after taking some steps to the face. For most of the match it was really Cena versus Booker which was good. Cena seems to have the match won until K-Fed gets involved which leads to Booker keeping his title and winning the match. I was so glad that the King won this.

Bonus

1.[TAG TITLES NO DQ MATCH]RIC FLAIR & RODDY PIPER VS RATED RKO-this match happened the next night on Raw I which the new champs defended the titles against the team that beat DX. This was actually a good match with Bischoff as special referee once again for Rated RKO. Of course the younger guys control most of the match with Piper and Flair having their moments as well. DX comes out at the end of the match and HBK delivers some sweet chin music to Orton costing Rated RKO the titles. Nor sure how I feel about how Randy took the super kick.
You also get interviews and such as bonus features. This was a good event from Raw and I must say that I kinda miss the brand PPVs, kinda.",1401840000,,3457,4.280245022970903

8136981,1,B000H6SXWE,"Umaga vs. Kane

Another pretty solid offering from these two. This was the first sort of inkling of the kind of energy Umaga could bring to a match and sort of the end of the total-Kane suck-a-tude we've seen from him over the past few years. Decent action with some very fun brawling. Nice match to kick off the night. **1/2

Tornado Tag Match

Cryme Tyme vs. Lance Cade/Trevor Murdoch vs. Viscera/Charlie Hass vs. The Highlanders:

Wow, this was a huge waste of time. Absolutely nothing going on, plenty of blown spots to go around for everyone to boot. Thankfully this was short and rather painless. 1/2*

Intercontinental Championship

Carlito vs. Jeff Hardy-- Tons of the 'you do a move, I do a move' stuff that is absolutely slaughtering the Raw mid card these days. This was absolutely awful. There were some fun flips to keep the crowd from passing out forever, but other than that, this was absolutely 'just there'. *

DX vs. Edge and Randy Orton

Special guest referee - Eric Bischoff

This was decent enough. Compared to what the rest of this feud had in store, this was great. Edge and Orton get their only win of the series, but the level of cheating was a little much. Sure, heels cheat to win but the way this was booked, it made it look like Rated RKO would have never had a shot at winning had they not had all the help they did. Unfortunately, that perception would be more than re-inforced over the course of the feud. **3/4

Women's Championship Tournament Finals

Diva Lumberjack Match

Mickie James vs. Lita:

Had this been given about five more minutes, i'd have possibly had it a little higher. Lumberjack matches are usually pretty shoddy these days, but these two at least made the most of it. Decent back and forth action as can be expected from these two. **1/4

World Tag Team Championships

The Spirit Squad [Champions] vs. Ric Flair and Roddy Piper:

I'm sorry this was terrible. I love Flair and I beyond love Piper, but this was just a title change that shouldn't have ever happened. Piper looked absolutely terrible and there couldn't possibly be a way to make a bunch of young wrestlers look as bad as they did. Had the tag belts meant anything these days, this might have had some more emotion behind it. *1/4

Champion of Champions Match

World Heavyweight Championship on the line

The Big Show [ECW] vs. Booker T [Smackdown] vs. John Cena [Raw]:

I TRIED like crazy to get into this match but it never once pulled me in. The storyline leading up to this was bad, the dynamic in the match was odd, and the crowd seemed to care less about the fact that it was going on. Big Show seemed to be the resident stud here. His interactions and back and forth with both Cena and Booker worked surprisingly well enough although the same can't be said for Cena and Booker on their own. The ending didn't bother me all that much, as the whole K-Fed thing was the Andy Kauffman thing reincarnate. Decent enough stuff, but just exceedingly flat. **1/2

Overall: Absolutely awful show. I felt like it had a lot of potential to be quite good but with the ridiculousness of the DX-Rated RKO match and most of the other stuff being paint by the numbers (you can't plan out a match when you're deciding who you're facing a minute in advance... and no , WWE do not rig the votes.). This is about as good as you can expect WWE to be with this kind of format. Hopefully though, this show will be on it's last legs.",1174003200,3,3430,4.491143317230274
8136982,3,B000H6SXWE,"Cyber Sunday was the third annual event where they had the fans vote on stipulations for matches throughout the night...however just like last year; WWE influenced the fans to vote how they wanted for the most part.

Kane vs. Umaga - The fans voted in Kane so he could get revenge on Umaga for kicking him off RAW.  Kane has been the first person to give Umaga some real competition & their previous two matches have been the best on both men's careers for the better past of the past year.  This was no exception and a good ""big man vs. big man"" bout.

Texas Tornado Match: Cryme Tyme vs. Highlanders vs. Cade & Murdock vs. Hass & Viscera - This was just a short brawl and seeing how Cryme Tyme was the only team in this match not to be buried by DX...you just knew who was winning this one.

Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Carlito - Well, the match itself was decent but you would expect more from these two as the crowd started to chant boring because of Carlito's bear hugs.  It picked up at the end but again, it was slow at parts.

DX vs. Rated RKO with Eric Bischoff was the special referee - Besides Coach, you didn't really know who if Vince or Bischoff were going to be the referee until DX did a skit earlier in the night implying that they wanted Bischoff as the referee.  The match was actually DX's 2nd best match since reuniting (Hell In The Cell was the first) as they didn't just beat up & dominate their opponents & Rated RKO left with some credibility unlike every other team DX faced.  Bischoff didn't play a factor until the end but again, a good solid match.

WWE Womens Championship tournament finals/Diva Lumberjack match: Mickey James vs. Lita - Well, the match itself as good but this was just a way to get all the divas out on the show which took away from the match itself.

World Tag Team Champions Spirit Squad vs. Ric Flair & Roddy Piper - This match was short & sweet as it was meant to be the ""feel good"" moment of the night as the two legends won the tag team titles.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. World Champion King Booker vs. ECW Champion Big Show - Throughout the night, there were skits where Booker tried to cut deals with both Show & Cena (including pimpin' out Sharmell for a night) which had heavy influence in the fans voting for Booker's title to be on the line.  The match itself again was good as most triple threat matches are.  The ending had K-Fed appeared & cost Cena the match setting up their New Years Day match on RAW.

DVD extras include the Piper/Flair vs. Rated RKO match the next night on RAW where DX got their revenge on Eric Bischoff, the WWE legends celebrating with the divas, an interview with Umaga & Estrada, and a promo for the Cena/Federline match.

Again, this PPV was passable as I've seen worse (ala ECW's the next month) but in the end, I would get this as a rental & from there, make your own opinion.",1172275200,8,2883,4.330855018587361
