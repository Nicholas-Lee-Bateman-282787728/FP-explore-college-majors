8176784,5,B000NDEPZ0,"I love it, I love it, I love it!!!  It takes me back to my native island of Trinidad.  Even if you are not from Trinidad or the Caribbean, I still believe that you will love it.  It's amazingly wonderful.  I can't wait for season 2.",1244505600,,232,3.9782608695652173
8176785,4,B000NDEPZ0,"This show is one of those totally surprising behind the scenes ones that no one would have expected to make it big.  Lol ok it didn't really make it big but it really is one of those series that just gets better and better as time goes by.  Though not initially intended as a comedy it is a truly hilarious experience as it gives a nostalgic slightly overdone and pseudo-semi-realistic portrayal of Trini-life.  Liming, commess, ah set ah bacchanal not to mention macos everywhere!!!...Can't wait for the later seasons to see the ""where is Mr. Du Soleil"" storyline. All in all a true trini cyah go wrong getting this set.",1211155200,,621,4.627272727272727
8176786,4,B000NDEPZ0,"This is just so so hilarious! It reminds me a bit of when I used to go to the plays in the Central Bank Auditorium in POS. I loved Westwood Park and I have the First Season DVD set. I would totally collect the DVD series if they are released. I presently live abroad and whenever I need a good dose of home (which is actually fairly often), I just pop in Westwood Park and I get instant kicks! Now granted, the acting is by absolutely no means believable... and the dialogue even less so. Just don't expect anything even in the realm of Emmy or Oscar material. Still, I thoroughly enjoy it. I'm waiting anxiously to purchase the rest of the seasons. PLEASE RELEASE THEM!! I want them all! I mean, really, it's just toooooo funny :)",1211155200,2,731,4.304347826086956
