2610726,5,B000GG4Y46,"In this Dora adventure, Dora goes around the world collecting friendship bracelets.  I really liked this dvd because it gives a child the sense of belonging to the entire world and that everyone in it is their friend.  Well done dvd.",1208390400,,233,4.658536585365853
2610727,1,B000GG4Y46,"The product description says that there is a Spanish track.  (I.e., mainly spoken in Spanish with English words sprinkled in.)  However that was not the case when I received the video.",1204502400,4,184,4.903225806451613
2610728,5,B000GG4Y46,"Where Blue's Clues once entertained my son for hours several years ago, this time around my daughter gets her entertainment from Dora the Explorer. Dora does the same thing Blue did, though, and that's teach kids things while having fun.

In the main episode, Dora's World Adventure, Dora teams up with Swiper and her other regular pals to rescue the friendship bracelets that have been scattered all over the world. To save Friendship Day, the pair will have to journey to France, Tanzania, Russia, and China. This is another exciting adventure that shows the true meaning of friendship.

Other episodes include Journey to the Purple Planet and The Golden Explorers.

Each episode teaches more Spanish words, which is a great plus to this series. All three episodes stress friendship and working together, which is especially beneficial to young children.",1179100800,5,856,5.143884892086331
2610729,5,B000GG4Y46,"What can I say, she loves it even though she already has the book. She likes her Dora adventure doll,too which greets you in 4 languages. All the more reinforces what she already read and watch, that she's able to point out the different continents in the globe.",1178928000,,262,4.479166666666667

2610731,1,B000GG4Y46,"The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends.  Their mission is to save ""Friendship Day"" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped.  It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken.  And what's more, the plot is really boring.  Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid.  The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY.  Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.

Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different.  It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice.  Dora sounds older.

There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them.",1163116800,2,707,4.584
2610732,5,B000GG4Y46,"Love Dora going to all these different places!  We even bought a doll from EBAY to go with this dvd called ""ASIAN BERENGUER BABY GIRL DOLL"".  The daughter loves to pretend with the Asian doll that they are going to China.  Too cute.",1161475200,3,232,4.348837209302325
2610733,4,B000GG4Y46,"There are 3 episodes on this DVD.In World Adventure Dora and Swiper travel to four different countries(France,Russia,Tanzania and China)to return the friendship bracelets Swiper has swiped. In Journey to the Purple Planet Dora and Boots meet five space creatures and travel with them to help them find their way back to their planet. This episode was only shown very few times on Nick's Dora series. My three year old granddaughter really likes this episode and watches it first. The third episode is The Golden Explorers which is the name of Dora's soccer team. They win their match against the other team which consists of very large dinosaurs.",1161043200,14,646,5.046728971962617

8131869,5,B000GG4Y46,"My children (ages 3.5 and 1.5 love the first episode ""World Adventure"" and if I would them, they would watch it over and over (which they have both asked to do).  Especially the older child seems to be quite taken by the different cultures shown in this episode (the child is quite aware of different cultures from home and school and seems quite fascinated to see them in a Dora adventure).  Of all the Dora DVDs, they love this one the best (because of the ""World Adventure"" episode); it is the only one they have asked to repeat watch back-to-back.  But they are much less keen about the latter two episodes, and choose not to watch them (we use the episode selection feature); in the case of the ""Journey to the Purple Planet,"" notably it is a repeat, as it is included on another Dora DVD (Best Friends - Dora and Boots, I believe).",1463961600,,837,4.422077922077922
