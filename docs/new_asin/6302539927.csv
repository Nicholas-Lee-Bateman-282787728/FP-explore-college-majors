7827811,5,6302539927,"Hi, This is the best Hard Rock concert/documentary movie I have ever seen! Why I only recently heard of this is a mystery but it seems to not have been given the praise it deserves. All for a good cause as well! It's political and shows the young people of Russia standing up for freedom and what they believe in. The concert is played in front of over 1.2 million people, yes that's correct over 1.2 million!! Incredible!!! All just two days after a military coo where many people sadly were killed. As for the live acts. Of course both AC/DC and Metallica were awesome but I think without a doubt AC/DC showed the most energy on stage and were the pick of the live bands. Metallica were great as well and I thought the Black Crowes were really good and added variety with a more bluesy sound to the usual hard rock and heavy metal bands that played at the festival on the day. Not a mad Pantera fan (they're ok) but still thought they put on a good live show. The whole movie is great and all bands put on a great show but the last two acts of Metallica and especially AC/DC steal the show with awesome performances. This is a must see for any hard rock or heavy metal fan or may I say and music lover.",1171843200,2,1204,4.216450216450217

7827813,5,6302539927,"If you want to see one of the most fantastic performances by Metallica EVER, then you'll want to buy this. Yes, Pantera did a fine job & AC/DC was cool too, nevermind the others...METALLICA stole the show. The song that was truly inspiring was ""Creeping Death"". The song tells the story of Moses going before the Pharoh in Egypt, to deliver a message from God to ""let my people go"" or suffer the plagues I will send you. In this performance, the sky is in twilight, the wind is blowing steadily and the band is primed. You can feel the energy in the crowd & on stage while James & Jason belt out the powerful lyrics. The ""die"" chant was particularly brutal with Jason throwing in ""mother-f*#kin'-DIE!"" in with chants. It is a reminder of how Metallica used to be: Brutal, Aggressive, and Uninhibited in their pursuit to be the baddest in the bunch. They do seem to be returning to those roots on their latest CD (St. Anger), which I also reviewed on this site, but we'll see where it goes from there. In the meantime, while you're on your way to picking up ""St. Anger"", order this video in you're in the mood for some classic Metallica beating up on your eardrums old-school style!",1054857600,5,1181,4.472222222222222
