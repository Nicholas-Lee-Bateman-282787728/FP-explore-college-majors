8175388,4,B000N6UFEC,"I just ordered a 7 dvd set from the Watch me learn website, they have a 50% off sale for school, not sure if it's a limited time offer sort of thing. It  as just under 80 dollars with free shipping for 7 dvds. You could also get 5 dvds for just under 70 with,I assume,free shipping. The psychologist recommended these modeling videos when my son was evaluated and diagnosed with Autism, he is almost 6 yrs old now. He just started kindergarten and is having a lot of trouble adjusting. I couldn't imagine paying 30 bucks per dvd, so I checked craigslist, and found the website charging 15 per dvd, but with major discounts for buying sets. I will update my reviews once I receive and use them. Save money look around! :)",1441929600,,720,4.373134328358209
8175389,5,B000N6UFEC,I ordered almost all of these for my 3-year-old nephew who was diagnosed on the autism spectrum. His mom says that he will just sit and watch them and that they have been really good in helping him with social skills and verbalizing.,1376265600,2,233,4.441860465116279
8175390,3,B000N6UFEC,"I ordered this video for my son who is 4 and has autism.  I thought it would be great for him to see social situations and maybe learn a few games.  It was a great DVD, however I only gave it 3 stars because it is quite short for a video that cost $29.99 and a little bit of what I like to call a ""budget"" film.  It is also quite basic, so for my son who has aspergers it didn't teach him much but he certainly enjoyed it and learned how to play ""mother may i"".

Basically if the video was $15.99, I wouldn't be complaining and it would have received 5 stars.",1372032000,6,559,3.8771929824561404
8175391,5,B000N6UFEC,"DVD is very good, i recommend it for autistic children and children with social skills and communication delay. Children play very naturally, unlike some other DVD's where it appears as though they are 'acting'. There is an older child and some young children, there is a mix of group of children, visuals are used. The thing i like the most about this DVD is that it is very natural and my autistic son likes it a lot!

8175392,5,B000N6UFEC,"I recommend this movie for anyone who's child is on the autism spectrum.  It's really good for learning play date skills.  It demonstrates popular games that kids play like charades and playing catch.  The DVD is done well as it keeps kid's interest while they learn at the same time.  I like the way they learn social gestures and comments too, as this is really important for kids with autism and pdd.",1259366400,12,403,4.555555555555555
