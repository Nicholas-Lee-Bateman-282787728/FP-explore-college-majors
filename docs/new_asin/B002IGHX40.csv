3936588,4,B002IGHX40,"The other reviews for this DVD are correct. It was taken from a VHS source and the audio is distorted. As someone who worked on the project I can say that the earlier version reviewed on this page was not supposed to be released to the public, but that a very good quality copy has now been issued in it's place. We regret some people have purchased an inferior product and if they would get in touch with Topics Entertainment a newer and much better disc will be exchanged. You will like this show. It's very similar to the Over America series, also seen on PBS, showing Colorado in all it's magnificent splendor.",1282608000,13,614,4.442477876106195
3936589,1,B002IGHX40,"I have purchased other movies in this vein, but the transfer to the DVD is awful. It was probably transferred from a very poor quality VHS tape. The music is garbled. The video quality is so poor that we could not identify what we were seeing on the screen.  The colors were terribly distorted.  It is very unfortunate that a movie with such great potential has not been transferred from a better source.",1255132800,14,404,4.52054794520548

8370946,3,B002IGHX40,"I absolutely fell in love with this video of Colorado landscapes on VHS back in 1994 when I purchased it during a PBS money grab, and the music just blew me away. I even recorded the soundtrack onto a tape cassette so I could listen to it in my car.  I found this DVD (elsewhere) and grabbed it up right away.  Boy, was I disappointed to hear that the soundtrack was not the enchantingly beautiful one I loved from the VHS! I think perhaps one or two of the chapters may have the original music.  Some songs used instead of the original are vocals, and the singing distracts from the lovely visuals.  What a disappointment!

Oh, the video quality is very good.",1452384000,,660,4.377049180327869

8370952,1,B002IGHX40,"I'm glad to know that the DVD that I purchased of this item was universally bad--otherwise I might have tried to buy a different copy of it.  I agree with what the other reviewers said--music so fuzzy and garbled it is hard to listen to, and I really wish the different sites flown over were identified.  I have the VHS edition of Colorado Landscapes, and the music is much clearer.  The sites were not identified on the tape, but there was a card in the box that helped you to figure out where they were flying...  (I wanted the DVD as our VHS player is on its last legs...)",1330992000,,575,4.247706422018348
8370953,1,B002IGHX40,"In addition to the poor video quality, the filmaker never bothered to tell, either verbally or with labels, the location of the individual scenes.  Colorado is a big place.  It would be nice to know what we are looking at.",1283299200,8,222,4.525
