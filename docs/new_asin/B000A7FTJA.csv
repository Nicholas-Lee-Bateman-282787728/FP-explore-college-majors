2377717,5,B000A7FTJA,"""The possibilities are endless"" says one of the scientists in a poorly recorded dialog about radiation and mutation. Then we arrive at the remote village, where the cruel radioactive octopus man mauls victim after victim by slapping them with rubber tentacles. Eventually, they capture the beast by encircling him with gasoline and setting it afire -- thus robbing him of his oxygen supply. A truly awful film, not worth watching unless you enjoy watching films that aren't worth watching ... which I do.",1338422400,,504,5.0843373493975905
2377718,5,B000A7FTJA,"I love cheesy movies. I love this movie. It is one of my favorite of the cheese genre. When special effect are done by what looks to be a very special crew, that's when i am happy. There are several quotable lines and plently of things to laugh at. Some voices are obviously overdubbed and just rediculously amazing. Octaman will always be one of my favs. I suggest everyone watch this movie at least once, or your life will be incomplete.",1301270400,,439,4.432098765432099
2377719,4,B000A7FTJA,"""Octaman"" (or ""Octoman"" if you use the spelling on the back of the DVD case) is a tremendously entertaining grade-Z sci-fi movie that should have been made in the 1950's, but was actually made in 1971. The DVD is ultra-cheap, which is a shame: it plays when you put it in the player; there's not even a menu. The film launches right into some ponderous narration on octopi and gets down to business quickly with an insanely cheap monster by anyone's standards. Quickly some researchers find a screaming baby octopus and put it in a bucket, remarking on how unusual it is. (""It must be a hybrid of some sort."") The father of the kidnapped rubber baby octopus is watching all this unfold and has plans for retribution. I was particularly smitten with the prismatic effect of the octa-vision, while the Octaman as shown only has two eyes. Small touches like that really distinguish this film. Later that night the stalking Octaman (who really only seems to have six limbs, though there are sprouts near his heels, so I'll cut Director Harry Essex a bit of slack on this technicality) rescues his progeny. Do not miss Octaman cradling his son (or whatever) in his arms...I mean tentacles.

After that stirring opening, the plot grinds to a shuddering halt while the movie plods on...and on...and on. While this film reminds some people of ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", to me it seems positively ""Zaat""-esque, only much cheaper (if you can believe that). The film features terrible lighting and really muddy sound, making keeping up with the dialogue a chore (believe me, it's not worth the effort). At one point there's a multi-second picture blackout that made me wonder if my DVD player had suddenly malfunctioned. Nope; it's just an artifact of a terrible transfer.

The Octaman eventually kidnaps Susan Lowry (Pier Angeli, who died of an accidental barbiturate overdose immediately after filming this) from the omnipresent Winnebago, and releases her from his burly tentacles only when frightened by flashlights. You will not believe how they eventually subdue him (by robbing him of his oxygen supply) and put a net over him. He escapes (of course) and taunts people in a camp, but luckily Susan, in a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, can reason with him.

After a dramatic log winching subplot, there's a showdown of humans versus Octaman in a cave (this part reminded me of ""Zontar: The Thing From Venus"") which should be exciting, but is actually turgid and quite boring. Octaman creates a mini-avalanche burying them in the cave, setting off hysteria about how they'll never get out, although they do in about five minutes. The cast runs for the safety of their Winnebago, and surprise! Guess who's inside? If all this sounds exciting, just wait for the dramatic conclusion and Octaman's sad demise. But wait...is he dead? You be the judge.

This film has a lot to recommend it to B-movie buffs: terrible concept, a beyond-ludicrous monster, a few actual stars who apparently really needed work (Angeli and Jeff Morrow), and a ponderous script. This would have made a superior episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", and is fun to watch for bad movie fans despite the often slow pace. Recommended for lovers of men-in-rubber-suits monsters everywhere.",1280620800,4,3265,4.941712204007286

2377721,5,B000A7FTJA,"This is one of the all time great bad movies ever. If you love films that are so awful they transcend badness to become awesome - this is one of those rare gems. Everything in this film delivers what you would want. The monster suit, the direction, the acting, the cinematography - on and on.

It's not that the film didn't have some talented people involved, but the overall effect is one of hilarity. I mean the film is called Octoman - what did you expect? A friend of mine knew Kerwin Matthews and told me he seemed rather embarrassed of the film, but there was no need. It's a highly enjoyable and fun movie that kept me entertained from start to finish. Few films of this type really work, and this is on an Ed Wood level of greatness. Mr. Know it all apparently doesn't know this film, because he missed the boat completely with his review. It isn't a ""good"" movie. Duh. It's better then that. It's Octoman!

Hard to find. But for lovers of trash cinema - it's worth it.",1253836800,,977,4.333333333333333

2377723,1,B000A7FTJA,"I have wanted to see this film for years. I had seen many still shots of this famous suit in my monster magazines as a kid. Fortunately, it came on one of my HD channels recently.......Unfortunately it's a pretty bad movie! Some problems stem from a low budget and some bad acting/writing. Kerwin Mathews(The 7th Voyage of Sinbad)stars and he does what he can with the script, which seems like it borrowed a lot from 'Creature From The Black Lagoon' The film suffers from some confusing lighting problems which make it look like it's daytime one second and then when they change the camera shot, it's in the blackest of night!? While Rick Baker's Octoman suit looks kind of cool, it's movements are hampered by the film's low budget. The film's only interest is to see Rick Baker's early FX efforts(he also played the Octaman). It was cool to see Kerwin Mathews again and Pier Angeli(Somebody Up There Likes Me) too. I give it 1 1/2 stars.",1205107200,,939,4.62874251497006
2377724,5,B000A7FTJA,"This movie is a blast! Evidently made by the writer of the original Creature from the Black Lagoon, this closely follows the plot of that film, though no spear guns are used here. The story follows a small expedition in the Mexican wilderness, studying the effects of industrial pollution on aquatic life. The most noticeable effect is a man sized walking octopus (although he only has 4 tentacles).

This critter takes a liking to heroine Pier Angeli, who died of a drug overdose after making this movie, and puts a hurtin' on team members with his arms-, oops, I mean tentacles, while trying to take off with her.

B movie veterans Kerwin Matthews and Jeff Morrow help round out the cast.

The main problem this flick has is that the night scenes are too dark, it's hard to tell at times just whats going on. The monster suit is really cool, and some baby mutants the team finds are genuinely creepy, with the mewling noises they make. All in all, a great b movie from the 70s, check it out!",1179878400,4,993,4.5055555555555555

2377728,3,B000A7FTJA,"""Wrapped in Terror, Written in Blood!""

THE STORY: A scientific teams investigates rumors of an aquatic manbeast terrorizing a small village. Eventually they discover the bizarre part human, part octopus hybrid. Their attempts to capture it for study cause death and misery for all involved in this thinly-disguised re-write of The Creature From The Black Lagoon.

THOUGHTS: This is yet another one of those infamous movies that's so bad it has to be seen to be believed. Unfortunately OCTAMAN is pretty tedious and at times even the heartiest bad movie fan will have to fight to stay awake. It does have some wonderfully awful things going for it though, if you're willing to submit to the punishment. Make-up F/X legend Rick Baker created one of his earliest efforts with the Octaman suit. A nice try, but certainly not scary in the least. Looks more like a villain-of-the-week from Power Rangers than a terrifying man-monster. Kerwin Matthews was a swashbuckling stallion in 1958's ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" who battled cyclops, dragons and all matter of fantastical frights. Cut to 15 years later and the only thing Kerwin battles here is extreme boredom. He probably took the role just to pay his rent. Kinda sad, actually.

THE DVD: The audio & video quality are decent but the transfer does not appear to have had any sort of re-mastering or restoration work done to it. Focus is soft at times and many night scenes are quite murky. Audio is okay, but nothing to rave about. Still, it is cool that this obscure Z-classic is finally out on legit home video. Even so, if you've never seen it you may want to either rent or download a sample of this from the internet before deciding to buy. I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie unless you're a cult film collector or a movie masochist. If so then you've just struck gold with OCTAMAN. I give the rubbery reject a modest 3 STARS.",1390089600,,1892,4.762195121951219
2377729,1,B000A7FTJA,"""Octaman"" is a horror film from 1971. It's rightly regarded as a turkey. All the usual ingredients are there: lousy special effects, embarrassing monster, bad acting, illogical plot, and so on. It also has that strange charm which marks out turkeys from films that are merely bad. Indeed, ""Octaman"" is a cult classic. This is the 40th anniversary re-release.

The movie features what has to be the ultimate cryptid: a humanoid octopus, spawned in Mexico as the result of radioactive fallout from Hiroshima...I think. One of many unintentionally comic moments is the scene where the monster (a veritable killing machine) turns out to be vulnerable to flashlights! Come again?! :D

The one-star rating from my part could just as well be a five-star rating, depending on how you think hilariously nonsensical horror movies should be rated...",1377043200,,838,5.154411764705882

2377732,5,B000A7FTJA,"Let's check list this film: Cheesy monster check, descent acting check, a ring of fire check, weird check, gore check, descent to below basic characters check, fun check, Rick Baker's glorious effects check, and from the 70s check. So a stream leading from the ocean to a vast desert/canyon-like valley in Australia has allowed for radioactivity to cause octopi(plural for octopus) to mutate. Said octopi go down said stream and live in a swampy setting. Octaman is just an over sized octopus who just so happens to have the sort of shape of a man. A family and other people go to said valley for vacation and are killed off one by one by the beast who's just protecting it's offspring. In good ole' monster fashion it kidnaps the female lead who's become the beast's love interest and takes her away. The film ends with the survivors lighting a ring of fire around the Octaman which takes away the oxygen from the creature killing it sadly Johnny Cash's song ""ring of fire"" never plays while it occurs. Yes this film is sleazy and cheesy but fun some may find it difficult to sit through but if you love cheese, are a die hard monster fan like my self, or love sleazy b-movies you will enjoy this flick. This is the film that rocketed Rick Baker's fame who would later do the effects for the great b-movie The Bat People 1974, the John Landis horror-comedy spoof of 50s sci-fi Schlock 1973 the ape suit looks gorgeous, It's Alive 1973, It's Alive 2 1979, John Landis's greatest horror-comedy film An American Werewolf in London 1981, Michael Jackson's Thriller music video he did the werewolf and zombie makeup,The Thing with 2 heads 1972, The Excorcist 1973, King Kong 1976, Track of the Moon Beast 1976, Squirm 1976, The Incredible Melting Man 1977, The Funhouse 1981, The incredible Shrinking Woman, Videodrome, Ratboy 1986, Harry & the Hendersons he even wore the suit he made, Missing Link 1988, Wolf 1994 and a lot more. Octaman is one of my favorite films and it's just so fun to watch I'd really like to own a miniature figure of the Octaman or the actual suit that's how much I love this thing. The disc includes: Main feature, trailers, bonus film about a giant flaming ball that rolls over people which was kinda fun, an interview, and scene selection.

Step right up folks and see the eighth wonder of the world--Octaman!  Part Octopus, part man, all mutant!  And don't you dare care about the story because it's only a service to set us up to see ample footage of the shambling and rambling sink-clog-suck-sounding creature of warped wrapping violence known as Octaman.  Seriously, that is the reason to see this flick and it gives you a lot of quite good footage of the monster.  What a great suit design (yes, yes, for the time).  It would have been that much better if they could have managed to make that mouth move and articulate but, still, I would have been happy to have been able to wear those rubber tentacles at Halloween time (I even tried to make a copy suit but it didn't turn out).

And for those of you who care about extra value you don't just get this marvelous movie but also a ""worst movie ever"" runner-up in the sci-fi low budget what-dun-it thriller ""The Cremators"".

Watching this monster walk with tentacles that looked more like pointed shoes was hysterical.  The camera work was very trippy (all right, amateurish, I was trying to be kind).  They also managed to throw in a message about ecology and recycling.  Loved the burning ring of fire sequence.  Wish I could say something nice about the bonus movie, The Cremators, but I can't.  The lighting was awful; at times everything else in the scene was lit but the actor's faces!  There was a running gag with a dancing hippy on the beach that made no sense whatsoever.
