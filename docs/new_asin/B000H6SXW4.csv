2629663,5,B000H6SXW4,I grew up on AWA and this brings back great memories.  It tells the story of Vern Gagne in a heartfelt way and documents the rise and fall of the AWA.  One has to give credit to the WWE for allowing this project to go forward as it does not paint a positive picture of Vince McMahon and Hulk Hogan's role in the decline of the AWA.  Yet it accurately protrays the great strength and ultimate failings of Vern Gagne in his management of AWA.  In the end it is a great testimonial to the impact Verne Gagne had on North American wrestling.,1164758400,2,537,4.184466019417476
2629664,4,B000H6SXW4,"This is one of the better dvds that WWE has released thus far.  Perhaps its best quality is that there is the least revisionist history of all the WWE dvds.  I get incredibly annoyed with revisionist history and it really distracts from the overall product on several of their dvds.  With this one, they seemed to have let the Gagne's tell their story as they saw it as well as some other people.  I learned quite a bit watching it.  The Hogan departure and the training side of AWA were two great segments.  There was also a decent piece on the history of the various regions in existence when the AWA was created.

The documentary also brought back some great AWA memories...and some bad ones too.  The main critique I have about the dvd is the fact that it wasn't released as a 3 or 4 disc set.  Instead, it's an interview dvd with some extras and a dvd full of matches.  The match selection is decent but with four decades of wrestling to choose from, there were plenty of alternatives to the matches on the disc.  There are a ton I would have liked to have seen included most notably the Hennig vs. Bockwinkel match that aired on New Year's Eve (an hour long, which might have factored in to the decision).

Overall all an excellent bargain and definetely worth picking up for younger fans and old schoolers alike.",1164499200,,1319,4.45
2629665,3,B000H6SXW4,WWE has managed to release another dud. The DVD is boring especially in the beginning but towards the end it finally picks up. The footage could have been a little longer and more informative. And more matches could have been added. It seems as though the WWE only wants to focus on the former AWA stars that went onto WWE and no one else. The box art should have been a warning. So once again the WWE tells a one sided story...,1164153600,6,428,4.2317073170731705
2629666,4,B000H6SXW4,"When the WWE announced this set, I really thought they would butcher the AWA's legacy and put their

own spin on everything. To my surprise, with a few exceptions, they told the truth for a change in

this documentary and gave credit to Verne Gagne for all his accomplishments in making pro wrestling

what it is today.

More than Vince McMahon, Verne Gagne deserves credit for making wrestling into the cultural phenom

it has become, because it was Verne who paved the way for this to happen. The documentary acknowledges

Verne as wrestling's first big television star. The man had endorsement deals, appeared on the Steve Allen

Show and was responsible for helping to make wrestling one of tv's first hit programs when it launched in

the 1950s. It's hard for people to imagine this today, and it did have a lot to do with the lack of stations

to choose from, but Verne's wrestling show drew a 24 rating at it's peak. A 24! I think the highest rated

RAW was a 6.2, Verne had 24 million homes a week tuning in! This was huge and it laid the foundation

for promotions to promote their product and get fans to go to the matches. All this is talked about in

the documentary and Vince gives Verne the credit.

All the great characters and personalities that many young fans believe got their start in the WWF, actually

started in the AWA and that is finally talked about on this DVD release. Mean Gene Okerlund, Jesse Ventura,

Bobby Heenan, Iron Shiek, Ricky Steamboat, Adrian Adonis, Sgt. Slaughter, Jim Brunzell, Shawn Michaels,

Curt Hennig and Hulk Hogan all developed their characters in the AWA before going to the WWF. The best

part about this DVD release is that you finally get to see this legendary footage that a lot of fans, myself

included, have only read about. It's really great stuff. The promos and the matches are from that old

school mentality of pure wrestling that I miss so much with today's promotions and it's great to see it

showcased here. I only wish that they had included more. Just like with the ECW release a few years back

that was only a 2 disc set, I really think 2 discs don't do these promotions justice when you try to put

together a retrospective collection. You need at the very least 3, with 4 discs being preferred. I mean,

they gave Hogan 4 discs in his DVD set, Bret Hart and Roddy Piper 3, they can't do the same for ECW

or the AWA? With that said, there is a lot here and they seemed to have selected the best matches from

the AWA and include them in the set.

Overall, the documentary was good and will really open the eyes of younger fans who think wrestling

begins and ends with WWE, that the foundation to what we know today was really built by the AWA.

Only a few complaints with the documentary. First, they seemed to repeat many things in the begining,

which dragged the pace down a bit, this may have been done to stretch the documentary out, I don't

know. There are also a few laugh out loud moments, when laughter wasn't intended. For example, when

they talk about Hulk Hogan leaving the AWA and not keeping his commitments to wrestle some shows

that he had cut tv promos for weeks in advance and the Gagne's accuse Vince of telling Hogan NOT to

keep those commitments, Vince has the nerve to say ""he doesn't remember if he did or didn't say that

to Hogan"". Give me a break! Signing Hogan was a HUGE deal for Vince and the WWF national explosion,

and he doesn't remember anything like that? I mean, the AWA was about to strike a national tv deal

to bring wrestling to Saturday nights on CBS (later, Vince did this with NBC and Saturday Night's Main

Event), but when CBS saw that Verne lost Hogan, the deal was over before it began. Hogan jumping

was huge and Vince can't remember details about it? Highly unlikely. This, along with the slow pace

of the documentary at times and lack of a 3rd disc brought my rating down, but it's still a must buy

for ANYONE who claims to be a wrestling fan. Young fans raised on WWE may find it boring, but old

school fans like myself will really enjoy it.

2629669,5,B000H6SXW4,"This dvd will show us some of the best wrestling the 80's ever saw. As a big wrestling fan, i hope the WWE puts out more dvd's like this one, focusing on promotions such as the NWA (WCW) and AWA that gave every wrestling fan great memories. They should make a ""Best of Starrcade, or Best of Clash of the Champions"" dvd. I have big expectations on this one and know the wwe won't let me down...i hope.",1156896000,2,400,4.141025641025641
2629720,5,B000H6SXW4,"This is a Great DVD. I Love The AWA. It's too bad WWE worked their hardest to bury The AWA on it. Verne Gagne was one of the greatest wrestlers ever, greatest promoters ever and also created and trained some of the greatest wrestlers ever. Hulk Hogan was made by Verne. Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Vader, Scott Hall, Shawn Michaels and Curt Hening. In 1984 when Vince decided to make his move to kill the territories and be Number One the major company he wanted to kill and put out of business was AWA. AWA was almost as good as WWE and to be the best you got to beat the best. Vince did some dirty tactics by paying talent he took from Verne to not finish out their dates to hurt Verne's company. It was a very personal battle and a lot of bad blood in WWE vs AWA. Verne made some mistakes like every human being does. He tried to take too much money from Hulk Hogan in his Japan money and merchandise sales. Losing Hogan was the start of the downfall as Mean Gene, Heenan and Ventura among others followed The Hulk as it was clear WWE was becoming Number One and they just offered a lot more money.

  The AWA dvd covers the pre Hulk days with the great stars like Nick Bockwinkel, The Crusher, Baron Von Raschke, Larry The Axe Henning, Billy Robinson, Larry Zybsko, and many others like Mad Dog Vachon. It helped educate me on the past of The AWA as AWA was 1950-1991. The AWA was before my time but I have seen a lot of AWA towards the end 1984 to 1990. I loved it as though AWA was suppossed to be struggling to stay in business I still thought AWA was great.

  In 1984 Rick Martel was made AWA champion he was great. 1985 AWA had The Roadwarriors who were just coming onto the scene. I always thought Martel was a great wrestler and champion. He wasn't a Hulk Hogan but he was great. I remember in WCW at the end of his career in 1998 he had great TV Title matches with Booker T that stole the show. AWA had The Roadwarriors who are the greatest tag team ever. They of course didn't stay forever but they have a big place in AWA history. Martel of course left for WWE like others.

  AWA getting on ESPN was a big deal in the Mid 80's helping them stay alive. Verne really new talent and he would spot them like The Rockers Shawn Michaels arguably the greatest wrestler ever! Scott Hall he spotted who when he came into WCW in 1996 formed The NWO making Wrestling Huge Again. Curt Hening for the time he was in AWA as AWA Champion was great but he left for WWF which caused him to have to drop the title to Jerry Lawler.

  Superclash is covered. Superclash is a wrestling payperview where all the remaining territories and promoters banded together to try to fight against WWE. I liked Superclash's but they never could beat the WWE as the other promoters couldn't work together. Jim Crocket of the NWA on the first Superclash tried to sign away some of AWA's talent. If you can't trust who you are working with you shouldn't work with them. Still Superclash was remembered as a great event. Superclash 2 had Curt Heninng beating Nick Bockwinle in an awesome match for The AWA title. Superclash 3 was epic Jerry Lawler and Kerry Von Erich had a great match.

  There is mention of Verne of making himself Champion too many times maybe. Billy Robinson in most AWA fans eyes should have won the belt. But Larry The Axe and Baron think it was because Verne knew he wouldn't leave his own company and would always draw money. I think like they said all the other promoters made themselves the champion because they could rely on themselves as in the days of territories a wrestler could leave the territory and hurt it. I would have like to see The Baron be AWA champion as well as Hogan but Verne did the right thing I believe by keeping Nick and himself champ as they weren't going to leave the company and always could deliver.

  Jerry Lawler claimed he was never paid for Superclash 3 so he refused to defend The AWA Title so Verne stripped him of the title. Verne's son said it was Jerry Jarrett who didn't pay Lawler on a shoot interview. I don't know who to believe. Nevertheless The Title was to be won in a battle royal and Verne's Son in Law won the title Larry Zybsko. Larry was a great champion and during the dying days of The AWA was great. Towards the end The AWA just ran out of talent. The people that stayed in The AWA were the loyal wrestlers.

  Verne also gave Eric Bischoff a break and Eric would later give Vince a dose of his own medicine buying all his talent and stars putting him on the break of going out of business. Verne found a lot of people who were just starting in wrestling who would go down as some greatest wrestlers and most influential people in wrestling. Paul Heyman was at The AWA too.

  In the end Verne was inducted into The WWE Hall Of Fame. It was the right thing for Vince to do and it was nice of Vince to give Verne his moment of recognition for all he did for wrestling as a wrestler and a wrestling promoter.

  This is a great wrestling dvd it's very through. I found out a lot of information on Verne's background which was great. I think there was a lot to cover but they did a good job. The AWA was great and thanks to The WWE we were able to learn about it. One of the flaws on the dvd set is the matches are clipped and shortened. Some matches are in full. I think WWE could have put more in full great AWA matches. But the documentary was well worth the price alone.

  Rest in Peace Verne and Long Live The AWA!!!! Cheers and Enjoy!",1444089600,,5513,4.247846889952153

We would be seeing the likes of Bobby ""the Brain"" Heenan, Hulk Hogan, Sergeant Slaughter, The Midnight Rockers, and so many others who were part of this great wrestling association until its demise in the early 1990's. It brought a lot of great stars who would go into the big spotlight of the WWE. They either began, rejuvenated, or wound up ending their careers in the AWA. I remember watching it a lot on ESPN and other stations that carried it and now it is just a memory. As a wrestling fan, I enjoyed a lot of these different wrestling associations that were small and had a lot of great talent among the ranks of who wrestled.

2629778,5,B000H6SXW4,"I grew up in Minnesota during the 80's and every saturday morning there was WWF and AWA on at different times.  It was the best of both worlds.  AWA was the hometown wrestling organization for us, it was Minnesota born and bred.  It was grittier and rougher around the edges then the smooth shiny polish of WWF, and we liked it that way.

I had no idea that the downfall ultimately came down to management decisions, and how they pushed viewers towards WWF as a result of these poor decisions. Sad that it went down the way it did.

When you look at all the legendary talent they put out over their many years, you have to have respect for them.

The documentary disc is very interesting, and worth watching to understand where this group started, learn that Vern was the one who set the pace for wrestling organizations to get on TV, how many legends he trained and employed who ended up making bigger names for themselves elsewhere, see the successes, and ultimately, the downfall of the storied organization.

The second disc has some of the old school classics that made me love AWA as a kid.  I totally marked out while watching it.  Brought the kid out of me, was fun to have a blast from the past.",1412553600,,1204,4.4363636363636365

Verne Gagne, for all his marvelous achievements as an athlete, Marine, student, amateur and pro wrestler, and promoter, simply did not use the dynamite he had in Hulk Hogan. He missed the boat in the 1980s and never recovered. With that said, this DVD is loaded with great matches, some not viewable anywhere else (Except the WWE Network), and the documentary itself is a who's who of old school pro wrestling. The Gagnes really did train just about everybody you've heard of from the 1970s-1990s. It's great if you want to know more about non-WWE wrestling and see figures like Nick Bockwinkel, The Crusher, Baron Von Raschke, and other greats whom did not frequent the NWA or WWF but on rare occasions.",1396656000,,844,4.633333333333334

The documentary was interesting because of the way certain AWA guys (namely Vern & Greg Gagne) kind of tip-toed around their anger over Vince raiding their roster.  I got the feeling there was some resentment there, but being a WWE product we don't get the whole story.  Anyway, I think you'll enjoy this if, like me, the only AWA you remember is watching it on ESPN and by then it was at the brink of extinction.
The matches?
Overall, decent.  Definitly old school wrestling here.  It was cool to see some early Hogan and Rockers matches.  Plus a chance to see why Bockwinkel is regarded highly were a bonus.

It started smelling bad to me when they made Adrian Adonis wear a dress and it only got worse from there. I bet you never see an Adrian Adonis tribute since they ruined his career. Shame on vince mcmahon for taking something fun and entertaining and turning it into something dirty and disgusting. Verne Gagne never had that vision for the sport(loosley calling it that.).He still beleived in real men with real skills(demonstration of) and not to many cartoon gimmicks. I can remember watching the A.W.A. and loving it when i was kid. Stan Hansen was there Champion for awhile and one of my favorites. everyday after school i would rush home to watch the A.W.A..Thats why i enjoyed this Dvd so much it was really well done and i thought pretty classy for the WWE. Besides a great documentary there are alot of great matches from past AWA stars.

I grew up watching matches from every promotion and I've got to say that there could've been at least a 4-disc set as mentioned above.

2629853,2,B000H6SXW4,"Let me first say I am not a wrestling fanatic.  I haven't followed wrestling since the Monday Night Wars.  But I guess I was feeling nostalgic and bought the documentary style DVD's.  The AWA was one of those promotions that was big when I was young.  Because of my memories, I was looking forward to watching this DVD.

First, let me start with the biggest problem....The majority of the matches included are edited!  That's right matches that theoritically should be the best matches the AWA had were edited down.  Why?  It makes no sense and was extremely disappointing when something like that isn't mentioned anywhere.  If they actually told you the matches were edited, I wouldn't have bought the set in the first place.

Second problem was the documentary.  While I found the WCCW documentary was really solely about the Von Erichs, I at least enjoyed it.  There really wasn't anything great about this documentary.  It glosses over how Vince raided the AWA to create his first big set of superstars - using tatics that frankly should have landed in a lawsuit.  It glosses over what caused the decline of the AWA beyond the loss of this first flight of stars.  It just seemed to be a DVD thrown together because the WWE had this footage and wanted to use it somehow.  The fact that the AWA did have SO many of the superstars the WWE first became famous with should have made this a great story...but it fell flat.

Finally, why is Ric Flair on the cover?  I know Flair spent the first 2 years of his career there...but he wasn't a superstar for the AWA.  He isn't even mentioned on the DVD except at the end when he appears in a list of names that Verne Gagne trained.  It was an obvious attempt to try to sell more DVD's using a little cheap advertising.  But there were so many stars that were great in the AWA that he really didn't need to be included.

Overall, just a complete disappointment.  The WCCW documentary has a few problems but it was so much better than this one.",1304553600,7,1986,4.50140056022409

The ring product was about as good as a indy show with some over the hill guys still trying to make a buck...which actually it pretty much is.  Here the best are highlighted...which all bolted to NWA, Memphis and of course the then WWF.  Of course they are highlighted by Vince because they are actually his guys, thankfully since allot of the performers Verne used were about as impressive as Boris Zokoff at best. How this promotion ever made a dime is beyond me, the matches are put together so horribly, especially Vernes.  During the comback there are always lock-ups...it makes no sense.  Again watch ESPN Classic if you don't believe me...horrible wrestling.

Verne gagne almost single handed created all the stars who would move on to make WWF. hogan,grahm,slaughter,jesse the body,mean genne,HBK,crusher,mad dog,dusty rhodes....the list goes on. they all went through AWA, and almost all of them were molded there. this also tells the story of when mcmahon started his hostle take over, how the AWA, and NWA tried to join forces to slow vince down. i cant really explain how great this dvd, and story is. i thought i knew alot about wrestling, but i learned alot seeing this. if your a fan who is interested in the history of the biz...you almost have to have this. plus there is a 2nd disc with matchs and outtakes.",1264204800,,1078,4.395

I wasn't as bothered by what was on the dvd's as much as what wasn't. Huge talk about the Road Warriors and the Freebirds and yet no matches to be found. What gives??? The match with Curt Hennig and Nick Bockwinkle is by far the best on the dvd. The Midnight Rockers cage match againest Playboy Bddy Rose and Doug Sommers is a close 2nd. We really could have used a 3rd disc. The AWA was around for over 30yrs and this is it!!! I have read bad things about Verne Gagne,but is there any sucessful owner/promoter that hasn't taken knocks over things real or imagined? I did like this overall because of the history of the sport. That seems to be missing now and is totally been molopolized as it was back in the 30's and 40's. The interview segments with Bockwinkle were great.

The bottom line is that the AWA WAS the best at the time (until the late 80's and early 90s).

2629889,1,B000H6SXW4,"I have no extraneous insight into AWA before watching this DVD.  But with only this DVD as reference, I see AWA as a business that failed simply because it lost some great superstars early on to the WWF, and lost some TV stations later on.

There's not much insight into the backstage going-ons of the business.  The entire first 20 minutes of this 1 hour and 40 minute documentary is devoted to such hyperbolic extollation and utter ass-kissing of Verne Gagne that the people talking about him instantly lose all credibility.

Can you honestly believe a man who says that Verne Gagne was AS FAMOUS as friggin JOHN WAYNE or CARY GRANT?  Anyone who truly believes that is quite frankly delusional, and/or lives in a world revolving around wrestling and wrestling alone.

Nothing backed up these claims or numbers, not even the footage.  They showed some clearly BS pictures of Verne as a wrestler, with a full head of hair and a rippling muscular body, then proceed to show footage from the same era of him almost completely bald on top, and as flabbily built as the average wrestler of the pre-WWF bodybuilder/steroid days.

I wouldn't doubt Verne's skills or fame if they hadn't insanely inflated it, and start talking about how Verne was an innovator of such styles and moves, while the footage shown in concert with the commentary almost shows the complete opposite.  Verne's ""quick style"" move consisted of a lazy tripping of an opponent by tripping his leg with his hand.  The ""high flying move"" was a rope-assisted headscissors to take an opponent into the ring.

From there, the documentary does start going in on the star power Verne created or brought in, and the building up of a vast and powerful wrestling program that was the WWF of its day it seemed.

And yet of all the praise and extollation being given onto AWA and Verne Gagne, none of it ever really points out specific incidents of genius booking or well-executed writing or the in-ring product beyond clips of people doing basic 80s wrestling, with the occasional break-out clips featuring the likes of the Midnight Rockers or Curt Hennig and others.

Once the problems begin with AWA, it starts to tell of supposed ""big mistakes"" and stupid ideas AWA suffered, and how Verne failed to keep up with the times.  But the biggest problem in this is that they don't tell us HOW.  HOW was a certain event a big mistake?

I am a little child of 20 who only really started watching wrestling in 2000.  I don't know what the situation in AWA was.  That is why I turn to DVDs like this to LEARN about wrestling history so I can appreciate it with the old people, too!

But how am I supposed to know that a collaboration show featuring all the best AWA talent and all the best NWA talent on one show was a total failure and a huge mistake?  They imply that perhaps it was due to the timing---it was the week after Survivor Series, so perhaps all the wrestling fans who'd spent 30 dollars on that were suddenly too broke a week later to pay for another PPV event of the same price.

How am I supposed to know that a certain PPV event with such huge build behind it was a catastrophic failure despite such great extollation and virtues being cast upon the talent and the performance?

Why does Verne not pay Jerry Lawler accordingly after he wins the AWA championship, then paint Lawler out to be the jerkass when he runs back to Memphis with the AWA belt and no intention to wrestle for Verne until he gets rightfully paid?  Why does Verne refuse to pay Hulk Hogan his due cut of Hulk merchandise when he's becoming the absolute biggest wrestling star in the US, then raise all sorts of hell with him leaving for the WWF?  Why did Verne sell Hulk merchandise while Hulk was in Japan, and not give Hogan any part of that cut?  What roles did these events play in AWA's gradual downfall?

And then comes its downfall.  What the hell happened?  I wouldn't know from watching this DVD.  From what I saw, the AWA started to mysteriously suffer a huge buyrate drop in their PPVs, and the WWF upped the pressure on them, and then AWA suddenly died and was sold to McMahon.  At least I think that's how it happened.  So much time was just spent on Verne Gagne, Verne Gagne's refusal to accede to McMahon's initial offer to buy AWA for millions, and Verne Gagne and his family mourning after AWA dies.

To make some company comparisons, the waning days of AWA, as portrayed in this DVD, seemed to mirror those of the WWE today.  This wasn't like WCW where the company heads seemed to be throwing random words in a pile of glue and making storylines and random SWERVES based on what words stuck, while buyrates plummeted into fractions of 0.0something and ratings shriveled to the 1's and 2's.  This wasn't like ECW where the company was completely broke for the last year of its life, before having its TV deal pulled and being left completely dead in the water and 8 million dollars in debt.

The DVD is more about Verne Gagne than it is about the American Wrestling Association.  If the DVD had a nose, it would be so thickly brown as to be darkly black.

In my view, this DVD's WWE equivalent would be ""McMahon"".  And that's not a compliment.  ""McMahon"" didn't claim to be a history of the WWF/WWE; it was a ""biography"" of Vince McMahon.

That's what this DVD is.  A ""biography"" of Verne Gagne.",1233014400,2,5348,4.534932221063608
2629890,5,B000H6SXW4,"With 13 matches spanning nearly 20 years, along with interviews with many of the stars - Verne Gagne and his son, Greg, Hulk Hogan, Baron Von Raschke, Bobby Heenan, ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund and Nick Bockwinkel - the two-DVD set is an important addition to the video library of any wrestling fan.

Founded by the legendary amateur and professional wrestler, Verne Gagne, and Wally Karbo, the American Wrestling Association was based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and operated from 1957-1991. The documentary portion provides a complete overview of the company's operation, with the matches from 1971 to 1988, and 10 of the bouts from the 1980s.

The AWA had a nationally-syndicated program throughout its existence, ran major shows - a forerunner to the WWE's WrestleMania spectacles - and marketed itself through a cable-TV program in the 1980s. Verne Gagne was not only the owner, but trained many of the wrestlers and held the company's world title 10 times.

The AWA revolutionized the industry in many ways, which makes the limited scope of this release a major drawback. But it would arguably be an impossible task to contain the cost by releasing a series of multi-disc, boxed sets. The project editors at WWE - owners of the AWA footage - did as good a job as possible to satisfy older fans who remember the AWA, while placing the company in a proper historical perspective for the new generation of enthusiasts.",1198627200,4,1412,4.97457627118644
2629891,5,B000H6SXW4,"Admittedly, I was quite ignorant of the AWA prior to purchasing it. What I knew of it was from about the mid-80's onto its end. I wasn't impressed by it as a young man but now that I've seen a good portion of its history thanks to this release, I have a new appreciation of what that league meant to this industry.

My eyes widened at all the stars that were grown there. I knew of Verne Gange, Greg Gange, Curt Hennig, Larry ""The Ax"" Hennig, Nick Bockwinkle, Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, the late Ray ""The Crippler"" Stevens, Mad Dog Vachon, Baron Von Rashke, The Crusher, Dick The Bruiser and a few others. I didn't know, however, that Dusty Rhodes, the late Dick Murdoch, Wahoo McDaniel, ""Superstar"" Billy Graham, Ricky Steamboat, Bob Backlund, Wendi Ritcher, Ric Flair and a few others got their main start there.

Often forgotten because either the WWE, World Class or the old NWA made them such stars is that the AWA helped The Road Warriors, Shawn Michaels (during his Midnight Rocker days), Scott Hall (prior to his Razor Ramon days), The Fabulous Freebirds, the late ""Sensational"" Sherri Martel, Madusa Michelli (aka Alundra Blayze from her WWE days), Paul Heyman (Paul E. Dangerously) and others during their historic careers as well!

What's sad is that a lot of stars and promotional things that made the AWA such a power during the 70's and early 80's were copied to some extent by Vince McMahon and WWE. Don't get me wrong, Vince made them his own BUT no one is going to convince me that he wasn't at least influenced by the AWA.

What's also sad is that if Verne would've just kept up with the times, the AWA MIGHT still be around now! Still, he seems like a good old man. He's one of the few wrestlers I wouldn't mind meeting. I would probably just let him talk because I would love to hear some great stories from him. Nick Bockwinkle and Bobby Hennan would be two others too.

Anyway, to concure with The Main Main, this set is worth it for the documentary alone! The extras are pretty good but the bonus matches I found a bit lacking because half of them are only partially shown. Beyond that, I still give this set 5 stars because of the documentary.

Highly recommended for any serious pro wrestling fan that wants to learn more about the history of the business! AWA used to claim it was the major leagues of professional wrestling. Well, for several years, it indeed was!",1196985600,2,2390,4.533642691415313
2629892,5,B000H6SXW4,"To my knowledge, this is the only authorized look at the AWA's history.  The documentary included on disc one is pretty thorough and interesting.

It's a bonus that they included matches as well on disc two (as well as the bonus material, of course).

I remember watching many AWA events when I was a child here in the San Francisco bay area at the Cow Palace, etc.

Here's hoping that in the future they release more AWA material with more matches, etc.

Definitely would recommend this to old school wrasslin' fans.",1186963200,,517,4.637362637362638
2629893,5,B000H6SXW4,"I watch them in Wrestlemania, Summer Slam, Survivor series and the Royal rumble. However, where did these wrestlers come from and how did they get started? Just like any other profession, before you make it to the big leagues you have to pay your dues somewhere. The AWA Wrestling association so you how the wrestlers got there start and the dues that they had to paid to before making it big in the WWF. Sergeant Slaughter and Jerry Blackwell take on the Road Warriors Hawk and Animal for the AWA Tag Team Championship. The Incredible Hulk Hogan takes on Mr. Saito and Dr. Dave Shultz in a handy cap match. You'll here Mean gene Okerland name mention as the time keeper. Rick Martel and Tito Santana face of against Jim Brunzell and Greg Gagne for some AWA Gold inside of a steel cage. You'll also see the East and West Connection also know as Jessie The Body Ventura and Adorable Adrian Adonis. Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwenkle takes on terry Allen who went on to WCW as Magnum TA. Now let's talk about the legend of Andre the Giant. Andre was born may 19th 1946. His grandmother measured in at 7 foot 8 inches. At age 12, Andre was already a very big boy standing 6'4 and weigh over 200lbs. Andre was working as furniture maker when he was approached about being a wrestler. Andre started wrestling when he was 17 years old. At the age of 19, Andre was over 7 feet tall and 335 lbs. One of Andre matches in AWA was against Jerry Blackwell who weighs over 473 lbs himself. This was a $5000.00 slam match on 11-4-80 with the first wrestler to slam the other gets the cash. Andre was introduced to his first battle royal on October 17 1982, where the winner of this match gets 100 thousand dollars. Some of the wrestlers that were in the ring at the time were jerry Blackwell, Jessie Ventura, Bobby Heenan, Nick Bockwenkle, and Ken Patera. Then on November 11th 1982 Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant teamed up together to face the Nick Bockwenkle, Ken Patera, Dungam and Heenan himself. Wahoo McDaniel also made his debut in the AWA in 1969 before he went to WCW also. Other wrestlers that came up through the AWA were The Fabulous Freebirds, Curt Henning, Rick Flair, and Magnum TA. Larry Zbysko, Superstar Billy Graham. If you think that Vince McMahon is the only owner to get into a ring then you never saw Verne Gagne wrestle. I believe that most of Vince McMahon's ideas in the early years were taken from the AWA. At Wrestlemania, two when Rowdy Roddy Piper faces Mr. T in a boxing match that idea had already been used by the AWA. The idea of the Heenan family also was used in the AWA. Vince didn't make Hulk Hogan the legend that he is because he also use the same name in the AWA it was also funny watching Mean Gene Okerland move up the ranks from a time keeper, to doing locker-room interviews to doing wrestling commentary. The match between the Andre the Giant and Big John Studd at Wrestlemania one as the 15 thousand dollar slam match also came from AWA. If you think about it, most of McMahon idea came from other wrestling organization. If you really watch this DVD, you'll fine that if it wasn't for the AWA, I don't think the WWF would be where it's at today. In addition, you see that some of the wrestlers were in two different organizations also. For instant Ric flair was wrestling in the AWA at the same time that he was wrestling for World Championship Wrestling. Overall, I give this picture 10 weasel stars because it was such a revelation as far as understanding the world of professional wrestling back in the late 70s and early 80s.",1174694400,3,3565,4.460949464012251

However after watching this you can make your judgment of whether to judge Vince Mcmahon on whether he killed the AWA or it was something else.

It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyways)- It was a different time of wrestling. I still enjoy some of todays wrestling and personalities, but it's not quite the same. This DVD is a small dream come true for us who were there and actively following these titans. I loved the documentary, although I agree with a few others here in wishing there was more. More matches from the 70's is my only minor complaint. They could also have a whole DVD of just ""war stories"" from Brunzel, Raschke, etc. Also, another DVD could be filled with the pre- and post-match interviews, which are almost better than the matches themselves.

This is the 3rd attempt at WWE telling the history of another promotion & based on their previous two DVD sets of promotions, this documentary was either going in one of two directions. It was either going the way of ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" where they spent time & went into heavy detail about how it's ideas had a heavy influence in professional wrestling today...or ""Monday Night War"" where they heavily focused on the negatives of the company & downplay the influence that company had on professional wrestling. Well, this DVD I saw went the way of the Monday Night War where I just saw a burial of the promotion by everyone involved except the main players of the company. And by the way, Ric Flair isn't interviewed or even mentioned until the closing the of documentary when they were naming off the wrestlers Gagne trained despite being on the cover, talk about false advertising! Bottom line is that this DVD follows the path of WCW in ""Monday Night War"" & Ultimate Warrior's DVD in which they build them up only to completely knock them down & out by the end of the feature.

Verne Gagne's background growing up kicks off the documentary along with the story of how the National Wrestling Alliance was born & eventually split up into the WWE, AWA, and NWA. How Gagne ran his territory & trained wrestlers followed by his innovations into the wrestling business (ala ""The Wrestler"" movie) are also glossed upon along with his strict rules & his idea of keeping ""kayfabe."" From here you'll get introductions into the early AWA stars such as Bobby Heenan, Nick Bockwinkle, the High Flyers, Texas Outlaws, Baron Von Raschke, Jesse Ventura, Superstar Billy Graham, Mad Dog Vachon, Gene Okerland, and others. The documentary takes a turn for the worse here as they cover Hulk Hogan breaking in and how Hulkamania was beginning in the AWA before Hogan leaving over money issues. Other talent started to talk about how they followed Hogan out of the AWA & were paid more money not to finish out their contractual agreements that Vince denied despite what the actual talent said. The title reigns of Rick Martel & Greg Gagne are briefly talked about in a negative light along with Larry Zbyszko's later in the documentary with Jerry Lawler saying he only got the title because he was Verne's son-in-law. The idea behind the SuperClash events were talked about and the reasons why that concept just wasn't working between all the promoters involved. The Stan Hansen title reign was discussed to the point to where it made Verne & the AWA look like complete idiots for giving him the title when his loyalties only lied with himself & working in Japan. The ESPN deal they had along with the new generation of talent coming into the company such as the Road Warriors, Sherri Martel, Eric Bischoff & the Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty) is reduced to the idea that they only came into the company so they would get noticed by Vince with Sherri even admitting it. The entire story behind Jerry Lawler winning the title in a unification match and all the politics behind the match is talked about before Lawler explains why he never defended the title & still has it with him today. The idea behind a Team Challenge series that happened in the dying days of the company are discussed along with a state lawsuit that eventually ended the company. They end the documentary on a positive note stating the story behind Verne's induction into the Hall Of Fame despite people like Ricky Steamboat not approving of it.

The DVD extras include interview outtakes such as Jim Brunzell telling stories about ""ribs"" in the company, the entrance & exit of the Freebirds told by Michael Hayes, Eric Bischoff telling the story of him coming into the AWA & eventually being an announcer, and several wrestlers talking about a plane ride with Mad Dog Vachon. The real gem of the interview outtakes were several stories by Nick Bockwinkle talking about things like a joke Bobby Heenan played on an announcer, his longest night of wrestling, and his favorite match. Along with outtakes were various AWA promos with Gene Okerland featuring Bobby Heenan, East-West Connection, and Mad Dog Vachon with a pine box.

The second disc is complete with 13 matches BUT only 5 are shown in full...and one of them is already available on another DVD set. All the clipped matches show around 10 mins. of the match AT THE MOST with most of them having interview segments before & after the match. I mean it comes off at highlights more than actually wrestling matches. The only matches shown in full are a cage match between the Midnight Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Somers (not the match on HBK's DVD), High Flyers vs. Nick Bockwinkel & Ray Stevens (with the introduction of Heenan as their manager), Pat Patterson & Ray Stevens vs. Billy Robinson & Frankie Hill, and two AWA Championship matches featuring Curt Henning vs. Nick Bockwinkel & a unification match with Jerry Lawler vs. WCCW Champion Kerry Von Erich (same match on ""Greatest Stars Of The 80's""). The other clipped matches are: Verne Gagne & Mad Dog Vachon vs. East-West Connection, Verne Gagne vs. Nick Bockwinkel, High Flyers vs. East-West Connection, Nick Bockwinkle vs. Hulk Hogan (not the match on Hogan's DVD), Jesse Ventura vs. Baron Von Raschke, Hulk Hogan vs. Mr. Saito & Mr. Hatori, and Road Warriors & Paul Ellering vs. The Crusher & Larry Hennig & Curt Henning.

Overall, I was heavily disappointed as I just felt that this company to be around as long as it was & bring in so many legends to this sport as it did, it just painted an ugly picture of this company & I felt Greg Gagne's induction speech of this dad at the Hall Of Fame did more justice to the company than this DVD did. So much information on here was incorrect like Jim Ross talking about how the Mid-South/UWF promotion didn't want to participate in the SuperClash PPV but yet the UWF was absorbed into Jim Crockett Promotions around a year before the PPV, AWA legend Dick The Bruiser wasn't even mentioned once, and they put over the fact that Greg Gagne was AWA Champion (including a picture of him wearing the belt) when Greg never held the AWA Championship.  This is only good for some archival footage & to see the old wrestling legends like Nick Bockwinkel & Baron Van Raschke but nothing past that. I recommend for a rental & see where you go from there.",1166054400,18,6569,4.6594827586206895

The top 10 AWA wrestlers from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s were Verne Gagne, Greg Gagne, Nick Bockwinkel, Bobby Heenan, Jim Brunzell, Larry Zbyszko, Pat OConnor, Curt Hennig, The Crusher and Mad Dog Vachon.",1525651200,,280,4.62
8137117,5,B000H6SXW4,I remember watching the AWA on ESPN  great memories in fact I remember owning the action figures and ring from the AWA.  I have the original AWA  VHS tapes that were sold at Kmart  like The Road Warriors road to the championship and others still . I purchased this DVD  when it was released and seeing the matches and the documentary was well done but I think it's long overdue for the AWA and WCCW to get follow up DVD sets I know a lot of us 40 yr olds who grew up watching wrestling want to see WWE release more 3 disc sets of AWA and WCCW so hopefully it will happen there again WWE Network has a lot of WCCW footage but AWA has been ignored so there's good and bad with the network options.,1509408000,,695,4.043795620437956

The only thing missing was Joe Zweiback and his Gera-Speed ads!  I thought this was an even-handed treatment of Vern and the AWA, meaning both sides were presented.  I was a big fan of Vern but I understand things can get dicey in business sometimes and pro wrestling was definitely big business.",1492387200,,439,4.4625

8137124,5,B000H6SXW4,"This was a fairly well put together documentary. Vince McMahon and the WWE machine made sure that certain aspects weren't brought to the forefront which could diminish younger fans opinions of what the AWA was all about. The matches were pretty good but a few older matches would have helped make this DVD set an even better representation of the AWA. Of course, in the end, none of the WWF/E's competition can be allowed to look better than what Vince created. With that in mind, I would recommend this to a fan of professional wrestling but I can only imagine what Greg Gagne would have done with this.",1457740800,,604,4.601851851851852
