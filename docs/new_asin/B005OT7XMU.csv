4854567,2,B005OT7XMU,Michael Gough plays a zoo owner who uses his animals to kill anyone who threatens the future of his business.  This is a pretty mediocre movie other than a couple of amusing scenes where Gough gets to address his lounging big cats as if they were humans listening to Shakespeare--otherwise this is slow moving and not very suspenseful.,1331769600,,335,4.775862068965517
4854568,3,B005OT7XMU,"Low-budget producer Herman Cohen fashioned a series of British horror movies in the late 50's and 60's, but he may be best-remembered for three dark thrillers; all starring the late-great Michael Gough. The most obscure, and now finally available, is ""Black Zoo(1963)"", from Warner Archives on DVD-R. Gough stars as a deranged private zoo owner in Los Angeles, who eliminates his enemies, one by one, by leading his ferocious, wild animals to their homes at night. Graphic violence follows. But ""Black Zoo"" is a let-down, after the tingling ""Horrors of the Black Museum"", also starring Gough. ""Black Zoo"" has some style, and the color photography of Floyd Crosby, but Gough is left un-checked, his over-the-top ranting does not help a stagnant screenplay. The cast is good, including Hollywood veterans Jerome Cowan, Elisha Cook, Jr., and Edward Platt. ""Black Zoo"" was released by Allied Artists, who absorbed ""poverty row's"" famous Monogram Pictures in 1953. ""Black Zoo"" is released in an 88-minute brilliant-color widescreen 16x9 DVD transfer. But don't look for any extras. There isn't even a chapter stop.",1322265600,,1109,5.271186440677966
4854569,5,B005OT7XMU,"The movie relationship between actor Michael Gough and Producer Herman Cohen can never equal the linkage of actor Vincent Price and producers James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff but in the case of Director Robert Gordon's production of 'THE BLACK ZOO', it sure as hell comes close.  Not only is it Gough's best spot on performance, it also gives older actors such as Jerome Cohen , Virginia Grey, and Elisha Cook Jr. time to strut their stuff and show off their talents plus a number of exotic animals (way ahead of its time in relations to the modern time Ohio incident) and a biting(no pun intended) performance by actress Jeanne Cooper to make it the most important purchase for horror fans this year.  Over the years, film cultists (me included) have seen pan and scanned duped red or pink faded Cinemascope 16mm prints to the point of being on Kool-Aid Vision overload, suffice it to say that Warner Archive have transcended the DVD-R made to order releases by issuing the definitive version of this underrated guilty pleasure preserving it in all of its 60's glory with gorgeous color and crisp sound.  The film resembles an old Monogram/PRC Poverty Row pot boiler from the forties with George Zucco in the Gough role but Cohen gives the film an edge which is probably, besides his Sherlock Holmes brilliant thriller Director Sydney Hayers 'A STUDY IN TERROR'- 1965, his best production ever.  Its almost a clone of an AIP Roger Corman Poe film with names like Pat Dinga and Director of Photography Floyd Crosby in the credits but it also has a beautiful music score by Paul Dunlap to shatter that mirage.  To show a cult of spiritual cultists involved with the mantras of exotic animals was a bit of a stretch back in the early sixties but it works just fine today. The graveyard burial scene of one of Gough's animals is worth the price of the disc alone with all of its fog shrouded glory. Warner Archive releases it in a stunning 2.35 widescreen transfer and makes you want to scratch your head as to why this film doesn't have a better reputation among Horror fans.  If you love 60's guilty pleasures, click the add to cart button and add this gem to your collections, it's just that good and see Michael Gough reveling in his perfect character mindmeld.",1319414400,11,2269,4.674185463659148

8481873,5,B005OT7XMU,Michael Gough in another horror with plot similarities to Horrors of the Black Museum and Konga. Still a fun fim though with excellent quality disc. High recomended. In 'Scope.,1388188800,,176,5.103448275862069
8481874,4,B005OT7XMU,"The ""BLACK ZOO"" was the 3rd film Michael Gough did in collaboraion with Herman Cohen. The other two were the cult terror classic ""HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM"" and the ludicrous but highly entertaining ""KONGA"". They would do one more film together where Gough is dispatched early into the movie and that was ""BERSERK"" starring an over the top Joan Crawford. In this chiller Gough plays a private zoo keeper who uses his animals to liquidate his enemies, such as an unctious realtor (Jerome Cowan) who wants to buy his property, a busybody talent agent (Virginia Grey) trying to ruin his marriage, or a sadistic and inept groundskeeper ( Elisha Cook Jr.) who delights in torturing Goughs prized tiger. None of these people engender much sympathy. In fact the audience may even be rooting for Gough. Although he is more subdued here (and putting on an american accent) Michael Gough still manages to find some scenery to chew. Whether he is lashing out at his wife or brutally beating Elisha Cook Jr. Gough's villainy shines thruout. One minor point if Goughs character is murdering these people to save his beloved animals why does he keep his pets outside in the cold and rain? The only real victim in this thriller is Gough's wife, (played sympathetically by Jeanne Cooper)because she is married to this tempermental, violent, and selfish maniac. Another victim is Carl (effectively portrayed by singer Rod Lauren) as Gough's mute assistant who reluctantly takes part in each murder. He is mute because he witnessed something shocking Gough did years ago. Others in the cast are the pretty and sensual Marianna Hill as a young art student who has a crush on Rod, and Ed Platt as the chief of detectives who must of used this job as a training ground for CONTROL, because his staff are about as effective and intelligent as Maxwell Smart. Also look for actor George Barrows as Victor the gorilla. Sharpeyed fans will recognize his suit as the same one used in ""KONGA"". The disc is presented in widescreen with radiant Eastman color. No more pan and scan with faded colors. The picture and sound are sharp and crisp. The casing is excellent with the original poster on the cover. The only drawback is there is no trailer or special features. So step right up and see if not the greatest show on earth than one that will at least chill you to the bone.",1349136000,3,2349,4.7317073170731705
8481875,3,B005OT7XMU,"BLACK ZOO marks the third and final teaming of producer Herman Cohen and actor Michael Gough (GOFF) and the results are definitely mixed. This is a pity because the other two movies, the incredibly lurid HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM and the deliriously outrageous KONGA are guilty pleasures of the first order. ZOO doesn't quite measure up to the other two although it does have its moments. The biggest problem is the screenplay by Aben Kandel and Herman Cohen. Although responsible for the first two films, they ran out of steam this time around. This screenplay is not lurid or outrageous enough and it recycles themes and plot development (young assistant to do his dirty work, unhappy female partner) from the others. It may have been cheaper to shoot it in America (and these were certainly not big budget productions) but this one really looks cheap from the claustrophobic sets in pastel colors (which resemble the choices you had in purchasing an American Motors vehicle) to the frequently non-existant use of lighting and that kept constantly distracting me.

While technically inferior to the first two, BLACK ZOO is graced by a number of fine performances from Jerome Cowan's sleazy developer to Gough's tormented wife as played by future soap opera star Jeanne Cooper. Former child star Virginia Grey is very good in her small part as Cooper's agent and Elisha Cook Jr is...Elisha Cook Jr. There are a couple of outstanding scenes that linger long after the film is over. One is the sequence where Gough entertains his big cats with an organ recital while they lounge on furniture just like domestic ones. The other is the funeral of a tiger which is staged as if it were one of Roger Corman's Poe films. When I first saw this back in the mid 1960s it was on TV and it was in black & white (which probably ""colored"" my view of it). This Warner Archive DVD-R is a high quality transfer that preserves the original widescreen aspect ratio as well as the 1950s color scheme. I only wish that it contained subtitles so that I could really follow and enjoy the ""remarkable"" dialogue. While not his best, this rarity is still a must for fans of Michael Gough.",1331942400,4,2165,4.727513227513228
