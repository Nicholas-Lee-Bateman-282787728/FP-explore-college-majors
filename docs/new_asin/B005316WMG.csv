On the surface, this is a comedy about love gone wrong. On a deeper level, it's about learning about one's true self, seeing others truthfully, and being real. Romance is nice and all, but what comes after the gloss is gone? How does a couple live?

Karl and Su Jung almost married, but she ran away from the wedding. Devastated, Karl moves away, changes his appearance and his life, and comes back to Korea handsome, svelte, and a champion. Su Jung, she of high ambition but little money, is stuck in a dead-end job. Karl concocts a revenge scheme, and Su Jung falls into the trap.

Or does she?

By the end of the story, Karl learns she loved him all along but wanted him to be his own man, earning his own way in the world, and Su Jung -- who always knew people are more important than money -- learns how to communicate that to him.

There's also a major theme of love not being dependent on appearance, but on the character of the individual.

There are laughs, tears, and a few ""boo, hiss, throw popcorn at the screen"" moments that just make the ending all the sweeter.

Recommended viewing, with good English subtitles.",1375833600,,1208,4.4389140271493215
