8717750,4,B00Y9GQTC4,"I agree with James Morris' earlier review in many respects.

First: I also had issues with the Blu-Ray DVD. My Blu-Ray player would say ""error there is no disc."" I double-checked to ensure the listing was correct (i.e. Region Free/Region 0) and also that the actual DVD itself said it was a Region-Free Blu-Ray. I also double-checked to ensure that the Blu-Ray Resolution wasn't the new Ultra 4K, etc., that does not necessarily play on all older Blu-Ray players, and found it was not. The blu-ray player had the same specifications as other Blu-Ray Players I had. I was forced to exchange the Blu-Ray DVD for a regular NTSC DVD. (I would recommend future buyers just skip the Blu-Ray, even though sometimes it appears at a lower cost.)

Filming: I found the filming uneven. It was jerky at times. Also, the decision to film many shots over the shoulder of a lady (in what appears to be the mezzanine) was decidedly odd to me. Really? Why? Part of the (usual) bonus of the filmed versions is one gets nice close-ups and does not have to crane one's neck into odd positions in an attempt to see around the taller person sitting in front of you. Perhaps it was in line with the director's visions to be inspired by Manet's paintings, since so many French impressionists loved painting scenes of the balcony/audience in the theatre, but in reality it was quite distracting.

Singing: I am not an voice expert, and come to opera more from a theater background, but I thought the singing of Damrau was quite good. At times I found the pacing of the music/conducting a bit on the slow side and I've heard/watched/seen live Traviata's conducted at a slightly faster tempo.

Acting: Damrau is a good actress and definitely pulls off the role, though she doesn't do the ethereal, consumptive beauty that Stratas does in the Zeffirelli film. Alfredo was okay, but nothing special. The Germont was solid. I actually rather liked the Baron (beats me why).

Sets/Costumes: Decent, but the sets were a bit sparse. I didn't love the ""split' stage look -- for instance, Act 1 had the party on one side and a huge bed of Violetta's dominating the other side, with no walls or doors between them (I guess I had to imagine them.) Act 2 had a tree with a bench, and then a huge staircase (Flora's party) also co-existed at the same time later in the act. I found these choices rather odd. Not to mention it tended to limited actors to one half the stage at times. Costumes were decent, if a bit on the austere side, but they worked.

I've read that the director was inspired by Manet/French Impressionism when creating this production, but honestly, if I hadn't heard that, and if you didn't have this huge painting of Olympia hanging over Violetta's bed in Act 1, in addition to Aninina being cast as a black woman (to echo Manet's painting), I don't honestly think the Manet influence is particularly strong. I've seen other production that do a better job of taking inspiration from paintings, if that is a direction to go; so that disappointed me, as I was curious to see where that aspect would go. (It didn't really seem to go anywhere; not to mention I was distracted trying to figure out if the singer as Aninna was in Blackface...)

Conclusion: I'd put it in the middle of my Traviata DVDs. Damrau definitely helps make-up for other issues, but since I am equally concerned with acting, set, costumes, directing, I'll leave this in the middle. I still prefer Zeffirelli's film and his Teatro Verdi (with Scott Piper and Renato Bruson) staged versions; I also like the Royal Opera House version (which I have with both Fleming and Gheorghiu.",1499731200,,3629,4.6609375
8717751,4,B00Y9GQTC4,"First, a note on the quality of the disc.  When I sat down to enjoy the Blu Ray of La Traviata starring Diana Damrau, I popped the disc in the machine and received an error message stating, cannot play this disc.  As I was looking forward to watching it, I requested a refund from Amazon and ordered another copy.  When I received the replacement, I immediately put the disc in my Blu Ray player and found to my relief that it loaded just fine and began to play.

The next night, I sat down to enjoy the opera, put the disc in the machine, and immediately got the error message, cannot play this disc.  After removing it, cleaning it and reloading it three times, I finally got it to play.  Please note that this problem has not influenced my four-star rating.

Next, a few complaints about the production.  I didn't really mind the threadbare sets; however, I found the camera to be quite jerky in spots.  In addition, the cameraman chose to line several shots over the shoulder of a woman in the audience, and her profile dominated the screen throughout several key scenes.  This became most annoying as the piece proceeded.  Finally, I found that the English subtitles did not match the libretto for a great deal of the first half of the opera.  For these deficiencies, I am subtracting one star from what would have otherwise been a five-star review.

As for the performances, Diana Damrau as Violeta and Ludovic Tzier as Giorgio Germont were both outstanding.  Ms. Damrau deftly handled both acting and singing, and she was delightful.  Mr. Tziers reading of the part of Alfredos father was one of the finest Ive seen.  Although Francisco Demuro as Alfredo was merely adequate, his performance did not detract from my enjoyment of the proceedings.

On the whole, although I have withheld one star for the inadequacies of the production, I nonetheless heartily recommend this performance of La Traviata for the superior singing and most enjoyable acting of Diana Damrau and Ludovic Tzier.",1497139200,,1992,4.744186046511628
8717752,5,B00Y9GQTC4,This production is amazing. Diana's portrayal of Violetta is by far my favorite. Her singing and acting are incredible. The staging is fairly classic if at sometimes minimalistic. If I had a criticism it would be that I don't like the camera angle from the crowd.,1476921600,,263,4.739130434782608
8717753,5,B00Y9GQTC4,"After getting 3 defective blu-ray discs of this performance I ordered the DVD and it was worth the wait. All the singers are outstanding; it is the production by Benoit Jacquot that makes the difference--also the gripping filming that is intimate but also makes you aware you are watching a live performance.  The design of the work is clearly borrowed from the paintings of Edouard Manet and not just because his ""Olympia"" painting hangs over Violetta's bed and Olympia's black maid becomes Violetta's.  The men look like they have stepped out of Manet's male portraits--a convincing and novel touch.  It all makes for a compelling production of an old war horse. Conducting relatively slow and heart-wrenching.  Highly recommended.",1443744000,3,733,5.186440677966102
8717754,4,B00Y9GQTC4,"Some years ago, we reached the same point with opera DVDs that we had reached a couple decades earlier with CD recordings: the most popular standard-repertory works were already generously served, and record labels began with justification to look on a new release as an unwise investment. Would collectors in significant number buy a recording of a warhorse opera (say, TOSCA) starring Thus-and-Such when they may already have Callas, Tebaldi, Milanov, Price, Freni, Scotto, Caball, et al., and even a few singers from the digital-recording years? The advent of DVD gave performers active around the turn of the millennium a chance to have their work preserved in iconic roles such as Violetta, Mim, and Tosca, roles they would not have been able to record in a studio in that time. Now, once again, we are at a saturation point. New DVDs of operas such as LA TRAVIATA do continue to appear, but not so frequently as before. The labels are choosier with what they pay to license and distribute, and streaming video looms as the method of the future. Even a performance in the popular Met Live in HD series is not as likely to make it to DVD/Blu-ray as it would have been seven years ago. When a TRAVIATA from some theater does make it to physical media, the experienced collector, who probably owns six or more TRAVIATA DVDs, asks first of all if it is special enough for him or her to bother.

About the performance of Diana Damrau here (Paris, 2014), the answer is yes. Damrau took a path to Violetta Valery contrasting with that of her exact contemporary Anna Netrebko (both born 1971). Whereas Netrebko sang Violetta in her early years of international stardom and then retired the role, Damrau waited until she was a couple years past 40. At that point, she confronted it in a series of productions of different types all over the world within a concentrated period. The present one, directed by the filmmaker Benot Jacquot, is perhaps best praised as supportive of her. This is a star soprano's show, a generally traditional in-period staging that makes attractive stage pictures while being too spare to be called lavish. There is never very much decoration on the stage, but what there is (for example, Violetta's ornate Louis XVI bed visible in the first act) is eye-catching. Jacquot's lighting designer, Andr Diot, works in such a way as to throw attention onto the characters, not their surroundings. There is coal-mine blackness around the actors and the few props. The first scene of Act Two, running from Alfredo's solo through the father/son confrontation, is played outdoors beneath a tree, beginning dark and getting still darker (Violetta writes her note to Alfredo by lantern, and deep shadows fall over the men's faces in ""Di provenza""). Some ideas do break with tradition, such as the treatment of the chorus in the two party scenes as immobile, faintly menacing and decidedly not festive in attitude, as well as some gender-bending entertainment at Flora's. But this is on the whole a tame show that will not shake anyone up.

Damrau plays a Violetta of style and wit early on, strength and resolve later. She is not so convincingly frail as Patrizia Ciofi (the Robert Carsen production from La Fenice) or Teresa Stratas (the Zeffirelli film), but few Violettas are. Damrau makes a lovely appearance, creates a character who is both sympathetic and admirable, and seizes stage opportunities with enthusiasm. The production accommodates some big, vivid, old-time-opera physicality from her. Above all this, her command of the music is complete. This time one does not have to talk of a Violetta who is vocally ideal for some of the role and less well suited for the rest. Damrau came to it at a time when she was more of a Countess than, as in previous years, a Susanna. She was continuing to perform the bel canto repertoire on which much of her reputation rests, but she had acquired greater breadth of sound and richer colors with it, and a Violetta needs these once the florid demands of the first act have passed.

Everyone and everything around the diva seems a shade paler next to her. Francesco Demuro (Alfredo) and Ludovic Tzier (Giorgio) are appealing singers who do contribute valuable things. Demuro is light of voice but a real Italian Alfredo, bringing welcome crispness to his words. He is youthful and good-looking, though more so in repose; the physical effort of singing is not kind in some of his close-ups. Tzier's musicianship is scrupulous; he clearly articulates each note within phrases many baritones gloss over and flatten out. But both men have been directed in a way that deprives them of fullness in personality. Alfredo is just good-natured and callow, Giorgio just serene and tactful. Both characters can be more interesting than they are in this staging. There are good voices and good faces in the smaller roles, but Jacquot does court controversy in one respect: he prominently displays Manet's 1863 painting ""Olympia,"" in which a bedridden woman is attended by her black servant, and he has his staging mirror it. Annina is portrayed by a Central European mezzo who is clearly not black but has been heavily darkened, much more so than is customary in other Verdi operas today when this is still done. Mileage will vary on whether this could be called offensive, but it is an uncomfortable sight. This is a shame, as the payoff for such a literal artistic homage is small, and the singer performs her role sympathetically. All of the assisting artists here earn the same compliment, including Damrau's husband, bass-baritone Nicolas Test (Grenvil).

The performing edition, regrettably, takes a number of traditional cuts one would have expected in a new TRAVIATA production 50 years ago, but which usually are opened in these circumstances today. The most conspicuous is the denial of Tzier his Act II cabaletta. Demuro does get to sing a verse of ""O mio rimorso,"" and he (like Damrau) is permitted his interpolated high note. Damrau also sings both verses of ""Addio del passato,"" arguably the high point of her musical and dramatic performance. In keeping with the whole undertaking, Francesco Ivan Ciampa's conducting is helpful and occasionally indulgent to the soprano, generous in rubato, and the Parisians create a seductive sound. One might wish for more energy and stricter rhythm at points, but this is well played in its gentle, affectionate way.

There are other obvious first choices: The 1973 Scotto/Carreras performance in Tokyo observes many of the same traditional cuts taken in the above and reminds us of the old ways. The first Fleming DVD (2006, Los Angeles, conducted by Conlon) is a conventional sauage-curls-and-hoop-skirt show, very well filmed, with glamour voices and a more complete edition of the score. The 2004 Carsen/Maazel, starring Ciofi, Sacc, and Hvorostovksy, is a challenging and powerful stage production, updated in its look to a more recent era. That the present DVD gets into the discussion with these is almost wholly due to Damrau's absorbing and intelligent work in the central role.",1442707200,17,7086,4.961279461279461
