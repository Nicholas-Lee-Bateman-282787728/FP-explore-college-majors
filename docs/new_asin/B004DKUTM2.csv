8425607,1,B004DKUTM2,"I have a desk top computer with built in TV/DVD/Blue-ray.  The New Gregorian-Vol 1-video Anthology Blue-ray that I ordered and just received will not play on this computer. I am thinking this DVD may be from a different region than the US or Canada and therefore will not play on my my computer/TV. Therefore, buyer beware. If you purchase this disc, as I did, you may end up throwing it away or dumping it in some junk box in the attic, just like I did. Fools and their money soon part.",1329264000,,487,4.351648351648351
