2807022,5,B000P0J060,"The best recommendation I can make for this DVD is that it increased my appreciation for Roky Erickson's music--and I've been a fan for 20-plus years. In my opinion, the feature documentary would probably rate four stars. But despite some muddy sound and disjointed storytelling, I'm sure glad the film was made. Being a longtime fan, I knew the basic Roky story (minor fame with the innovative 13th Floor Elevators, followed by a marijuana bust that led to a damaging stint in a high-security mental institution, followed by a sporadic career in which Roky created brilliant music in the brief intervals during which he was able to function well). But this movie fleshed out his life story, making clear that Roky had schizophrenic tendencies all his life (apparently inherited from his mother's side; what little we see and hear of Roky's father - all but accused of molestation by one of Roky's brothers - gives that much more insight into the Erickson family tragedy).

What really makes this DVD are the bonus features: about a half-dozen songs from 1977-84, a few spoken-word readings from Roky, and two ""postscript"" mini-documentaries from 2005 and 2007 (the film was completed in 2002). The 2005 documentary shows the build-up to Roky's comeback show at the Austin City Limits festival, and shows Roky much further recovered than he appears in the feature. It's truly inspiring. The 2007 postscript leaves the story a little up in the air--Roky wins his independence in court. You can see that Roky still lives in his own world, and probably can't live truly independently, but you get the impression he'll be OK with the support of the family, who are all in a much better state with Roky doing so much better.",1184716800,5,1719,4.886986301369863
2807023,5,B000P0J060,"I saw ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" last night, along with a live performance by Roky Erickson and the Explosives. This movie documents Roky's mental health decline from illegal drug use as well as his stay at Rusk State Prison (after a regrettable and dubious insanity plea for possession of marijuana) to his youngest brother Sumner's battle to become Roky's guardian.

In the beginning, the movie details the rise of the 13th Floor Elevators as well as several musicians commenting on the influence of Roky and the Elevators on rock and roll. The remainder of the movie vividly shows Roky's mental condition as well as the chaotic living conditions Roky seems content to remain in. More correctly, it's not that he's content to live in these conditions, it's that his mother's complete control over him and her distrust of psychiatry prevents him from getting the treatment that would benefit him.

The Erickson family could be considered the original Osbourne's, one big dysfunctional family. Much of the movie focuses on the daily interactions between Roky and his mother in Austin. There are also brief interviews with three of Roky's four brothers. The fourth brother, Sumner lives in Pittsburgh next door to Roger Erickson, Roky's father. Sumner maintains that through extensive counseling, he has been able to break free from his mother's domination and hold over him. As a result, Sumner becomes determined to wrestle Roky from his mother's guardianship so that he can receive proper treatment and medication.

Although the movie does not outright condemn Evelyn Erickson for her mismanagement of Roky, it does show that Roky improves after living with Sumner for a year, receiving counseling and presumably medication. However, Sumner's somatic treatments do come off as a little goofy and ""new age-ish."" And yet when Sumner's therapist asks Roky to sing a song, he picks up a guitar and starts playing and singing like the past tumultuous 25 plus years were but yesterday. And fortunately for us, this is how Roky is when he plays live. It's as if the fog of schizophrenia, depression, and drug use is lifted when he picks up a guitar.

In a telling moment, Sumner somewhat tacitly acknowledges that maybe his mother did the best she could with Roky when he admits that that caring for Roky is a challenge.

Incidentally, if you go to Roky's web site, you can donate to a trust fund to help Sumner fulfill his dream for Roky ""to know permanent abundance, dignity, and wellness, in his life.""",1184457600,18,2496,4.961722488038277
2807024,5,B000P0J060,"This is a wonderful film and is a must have for all Roky Erickson fans.  I had the privilege of seeing the premier of this film on July 13, 2007 in Austin, Texas in celebration of Roky's 60th Birthday.  It was an outstanding experience.  To top things off, after the film, Roky gave an absolutely amazing live performance with his current band The Explosives.  What a night.  Roky and the Explosive rocked like no one I've seen do in a long, long time.  The band was tight and under Roky's leadership, literally brought the house down.  Outstanding!

The film provides a good deal of insight into Roky's life beginning with his childhood in Austin, Texas throughout his legal and psychiatric bouts and issues.  What was amazing to me, was to see how, at a time in his life while under the guardianship of his mother, it seemed as though there remained no desire whatsoever (and perhaps ability as well) for Roky to continue to create and perform music, which he is so gifted at doing and so clearly loves to do.  Seeing his band perform after the film, was proof that Roky Erickson is back, is alive and well, and is in tip-top form!!

You're Gonna Miss Me contains early film footage of the 13th Floor Elevators, including a wonderful clip of their appearance on Dick Clark's American Band.  In addition to a great amount of really great nostalgic film footage from the initial days of the psychedelic era, the film is sprinkled with appearances from Erickson family members and friends, Austin law enforcement officers, and commentary from Roky's many admirers, including Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top and the great Austin, Texas artist Jim Franklin.

Although I have been a rocker and music fan for many, many years, I have actually just discovered and turned-on to Roky's music.  I am so glad I did.  Purchase ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", you won't be disappointed.  Then proceed to explore Roky's music, if you haven't already.  Oh yeah, do try to catch him in concert if you have the opportunity. Again, Roky still rocks with the best and will absolutely blow your mind.",1184371200,13,2065,4.691666666666666
2807025,5,B000P0J060,"""I, Roger (Roky) Erickson, do hereby declare that I am not a member of the human race (not an earthling) and am in fact an alien from a planet other than earth."" His quote intrigued me to watch this movie. Even though I was a novice in psychedelic music and I didn't know who Roky was, the movie was fascinating enough to intrigue me; ""how is he doing right now?""

There are a lot of biography movies about the dramatic, somewhat unfortunate life of extraordinary people. You might assume that You're Gonna Miss Me is just one of them. However, the difference between those and `You're Gonna Miss Me' is that this is an on-going story about a sublime musician.

The movie genuinely follows Roky Erickson's prosaic, isolated life. He is a quiet person, walking around his house like a zombie. But once the movie has shown his performance footages that were recorded when he was in the limelight back in 1970s, it definitely gives you nostalgia, but you can't help but wonder if you could ever see him performing like he used to be. And the real world doesn't let you down by making it as just nostalgia because you actually can see him at the concert. Yes, he still rocks.

Thanks to his brother, now he has overcome his inert attitude; he has been performing at many concerts. I was lucky enough to see him singing and playing guitar on the stage the other day; it was such an unforgettable experience especially after watching You're Gonna Miss Me.

2807027,4,B000P0J060,"Roky erikson destroyed his life with drugs. Usually that's the end of the story and I have several friends that are quite dead from drugs. However roky was a very good musician and pioneer.  this film shows us the shell that is left over , at the end of the movie we see him starting to come back. And in reality the man recovered a lot. Which is not in this movie. But he did go back to music! And now functions pretty well with help. But during the time of this film he was a shadow of a man.  I wish they'd added that to it later on because this ends with him still a shell like being.  I love the guys music though , especially the 13th floor elevators. the first psych rock band ever.  But if you watch this one , just remember that due to his brother he did return and is well enough to rock out in concert! Which is not what you would expect most people don't return from decades of heroin and lsd damage to become functioning again. This is the story of roky and his start of recovery.  Several other band members he knew weren't so lucky! the guitarist of the elevators was shot to death by his stoned wife! In 1978. His brother also escaped drug abuse , so that's another good part of this movie. THE dvd looks pretty good and the story is worth watching. Only it ends before the man's return to music which by any standard is a miracle.",1369785600,,1347,4.125954198473282
2807028,4,B000P0J060,"Documentaries are a film genre that one can find either interesting or boring.  Truth IS stranger than fiction, and this documentary is interesting in portraying a ""genius"" and his fall.

I never heard of Roky Erickson or ""The 13th Floor Elevators,"" but I'm not a huge music history buff.  I just happened to snag this dvd at a local store because the topic sounded interesting: A truly gifted musician (writing and singing) fell from grace (so to speak) after using bad drugs.  After a period of time, he just lost his passion for music.

Well, the movie begins with the youngest of five children attempting to become the guardian of his oldest brother through the Texas court system.  The mother is shown as a woman who believes that she can provide the best for her mentally-destroyed son, Roky, by not allowing him to take medicines to help him psychologically (the ""I don't believe in medical science"" bit"").  The documentary moves from the past history of Roky from his rise to fame to his problems with adjusting to reality and a mother who isn't able to fully understand why her son(s) is the way his is.  It is a fascinating documentary, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!

Although my knowledge of music history is lacking, I couldn't stop thinking that the story of the musician Roky Erickson may be similar to Syd Barrett.  As a person who likes biopics, this documentary is on the same level as fictional accounts of Sid Vicious ('Sid and Nancy'), Jim Morrison ('The Doors'), and Ian Curtis ('Control').  With this movie, the background story of Roky is what makes this a great feature.  I learned about someone who was highly influential in the world of psychedelic music, not just a fictional representation of such a person.  You meet his wives, child, and girlfriends, as well as ex-band members and doctors.  There was quite a bit of research put into the documentary, and that is admirable and invaluable!

I had some problems with the movie, and these may be more personal than universal. There is a missing brother who is not included in any of the footage.  The other two middle children are unable to fully reveal their feeling towards the lawsuit (they seem to purposely be distancing themselves from the documentary).  The father is the most complex character, but he is so distant that little is revealed about him (other than he lives next door to the youngest son and is nearly catatonic and anti-social).  The interviews with famed people of the musical world drop away in the last third of the movie.  There seems to be footage missing of the 'present' that creates bias on the filmmakers' part.  Perhaps it is already too lengthy of a feature?  I don't know.

I enjoyed this documentary.  For me to not give 5 stars is difficult, but my opinions in the preceding paragraph are valid reasons for me to not give 5 stars.

4 of 5 Amazon stars.  Worth a view, especially for those who enjoy music history.",1368316800,2,2941,4.686159844054581
2807029,3,B000P0J060,"You're Gonna Miss Me (Keven McAlester, 2005)

You're Gonna Miss Me, which looks at the post-musical life (one cannot call it a career) of psych-rock pioneer and legendary schizophrenic Roky Erickson, is one of the most harrowing things I have ever seen on celluloid. It is also well-nigh incoherent, and since I watched it I've spent a good deal of time weighing whether this was intentional on the part of McAlester (The Dungeon Masters), as a kind of mirroring of Erickson's own thought processes, or whether that even matters (as clever/possibly brilliant as the idea is). I've come to the reluctant conclusion that it doesn't, and that something a little more straightforward would've gotten the job done a lot better than this did--which I rush to add in no way mitigates the straight-up creep factor this movie produces, which is almost unheard-of in the documentary realm.

We begin with an arresting scene, in which Roky's little brother Sumner Erickson is testifying that he, not their mother, should be Roky's legal guardian, alleging that, basically, she's messed him up for the past thirty-five years. Powerful stuff. We then trade off scenes of Roky's life today with documentary bits about the rise and fall of the 13th Floor Elevators and the Aliens. (We eventually come back round to that courtroom scene towards the end of the film, after we've gotten to know Roky's mother even better than we've gotten to know Roky.) Pretty basic documentary technique, but (a) the historical bits seem almost unfinished; there's little snippets of interviews at the beginning with big-name folks like Patti Smith and Billy Gibbons, but those die off pretty quickly, and (b) the present-day bits featuring Roky seem as if they're there solely to create that creeptastic atmosphere, as contrasted to the present-day bits featuring Roky's mother, which are equally creeptastic, but at least move the story forward.

But my ultimate complaint is that the film raises a lot of questions, and then never even attempts to answer any of them. The most obvious is how much of Roky's current state has to do with his incredible, massive drug abuse, how much has to do with the electroshock treatments he was subjected to while locked up in an asylum, and how much is genetic. (I'm no psychologist, but it seems to me you can't watch this movie and not come away well aware that crazy runs deep in the Erickson family.) Perhaps there is no real answer, at least not a definitive one, but no one even tries. We get a lot of bitter sniping from various family members, all of which goes nowhere. Etc. There are a lot of very interesting threads to be found here, but all are left ragged and incomplete.

With a little more planning, a little more asking of the right questions, this could have been one of the great musical documentaries of all time. As it is, it's remarkably like the music of Roky Erickson and the Aliens--a curiosity that seems earnest, but that still has someone in the background looking at how to best hook the rubes come to look at the freaks. ***",1365724800,2,3061,4.813688212927756
2807030,5,B000P0J060,"Way back in the 1960's there was a band called The 13th Floor Elevators.
There was a lead singer in that band of incredible talent named Roky Erikson.
Roky coined the term ""psychadelic rock"".

This is the story of this musical genius's descent into madness.
He was busted back in Texas with one joint of marijuana and was sentenced
to three years in an asylum for the criminally insane.
He wasn't insane when he went in, but he was when he came out.

Fast forward to a few years ago and we see Roky living with his mom.
He has dozens of old televisions all tuned to either static or
home shopping channels in all the rooms of the house.
His old band members tell him he's going to the store with them, but
they bring him to where they are playing, put a guitar around his neck,
and push him out on stage. But tragically, even this doesn't bring
Roky back to sanity and his former musical talent.

This is as good a documentary as I've ever seen. I especially loved the
scenes of Roky singing, both in the old band and in his later years.
His voice is a classic rocker's voice, and his song writing is up there with
the best. I had never heard of him but now I want to get a few of his
songs.

There is a thin line between genius and insanity and we see this gifted
singer and songwriter walk the tightrope between the two. His
family is pretty far out there also. If you love rock music especially you
will enjoy this documentary. It is happy and sad and hopeful. And some of the music is great.",1340409600,2,1495,4.198606271777003
2807031,5,B000P0J060,"Roky Erickson has one of those great voices that seem to come out of the ether and define what we now come to regard as essentially psychedelic. You can't escape its magnificence anymore than you will never tire from hearing it.  That it comes from such a sweet guy and, as we learn from this documentary, traversed a path that could easily have ended in tragedy only enhances its brilliance. His is a story that seems to traject us to a time and a place that mixes an eccentric and talented family with the archaic marijuana laws of the period to put Roky in a setting that hopefully wouldn't happen today. That he has come out the other side to be once again performing and establishing his place as one of the pivotal figures in our Rock 'n' Roll history is wonderful and no doubt enhanced by films like this.",1265155200,3,812,4.413333333333333
2807032,5,B000P0J060,"Way back in the summer of 1986 I bought my first copy of Rolling Stone magazine. In between articles about Van Halen and Jay Leno were the music reviews. One of the reviews covered an album by someone named Roky Erickson; I remember the article mentioned that he had once been with a group called The Thirteenth Floor Elevators. I never heard anything else about Roky, but somehow that review stuck in my mind.

More than 20 years later, I came across this ""biopic"" about Roky. I read the synopsis and I was hooked. Roky had once been near the top when the Elevators seemed poised for stardom. In the years since, he'd been diagnosed as a schizophrenic, been confined to mental hospitals, and disappeared from the music scene.

The human drama abounds in You're Gonna Miss Me. There is something about unfulfilled potential that fascinates. The unanswerable question ""What might have been?"" nags at me. Roky's family was tortured (to say the least) and their conflicts came into the open when they tried to decide how to care for him. You're Gonna Miss Me bares many family secrets.

My only complaint about this film is the volume. The sound is clear, but the music scenes are much louder than are the other scenes. I had to adjust the volume throughout.

Don't miss You're Gonna Miss Me (haha).",1264204800,5,1296,4.671052631578948
2807033,5,B000P0J060,"This excellent documentary about Roky Erickson gives us great insight into his life so far as well as his success in the music industry. Sadly, we also witness his slow but sure descent into schizophrenia after using LSD over 300 times and other drugs as well. This story has it all: a broken family in which little is actually discussed; an ill son being cared for by a controlling mother who (very conveniently) does not trust psychiatry to help her son Roky; divorce; bands inside a high security psychiatric hospitals with murderers as members of the band--and even more.

The movie flows well and there's little that could be edited out; it's all very interesting and Roky's story is told with great sensitivity and respect. His voice WAS incredible--and it still IS! He can still play guitar, sing well and jam with his band in live concerts after considerable counseling and psychiatric drug treatment for his schizophrenia. The cinematography is excellent and the interviews with Roky's brothers, his two ex-wives, his son, his mother, his father and others really impress me. It's also quite a testament to Roky's talent to have greats like Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top and Thurston Moore from Sonic Youth comment on just how influential Roky and the first band he played with, The 13th Floor Elevators, really were. There's also excellent archival footage from American Bandstand when Roky and the rest of The 13th Floor Elevators played on the show hosted by Dick Clark; and even the still photos of Roky back in the day are wonderful.

As others have noted, the film opens with a court hearing about guardianship for Roky; the judge decides that Roky's brother Sumner would be a better choice for guardianship than Roky's mother who clearly has problems of her own. It's great to see Roky's transformation while he's living with his brother.

It may well seem as if I've given the whole story away; but I assure you I didn't. The stories we get from Roky's two former wives are incredible; and there's yet another brief interview with a former girlfriend of Roky's that I also liked. The archival footage is electric in ways that words cannot express and the time Sumner interviews his own father about Roky is also quite interesting. There's quite a story about what happened to Roky when he was caught with a single marijuana cigarette; be on the lookout for that!

The DVD comes with some nice extras. In particular, I liked the deleted scenes and the brief extra about the filmmakers. I'll let you discover the other bonus features on your own!

This documentary is quite powerful, moving and memorable. Indeed, you'll be rooting for Roky just as I was because he is truly a decent human being with many charming qualities even when he's not feeling well. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy biographies and people who enjoy rock from the 1960s. In addition, people who like films that show the disabled struggling to achieve their goals despite the odds would do well to add this to their collections.",1258070400,2,3029,4.8173076923076925

2807036,4,B000P0J060,"""You're Gonna Miss Me"" is a creative, superbly made documentary on the life of Austin rock legend Roky Erickson. Fans should be warned that the film isn't a music video or a retrospective of any kind, and so shouldn't be approached as such. It is not even ""entertainment"", though it's very engaging, moving and even suspenseful.  Those seeking only Roky's music should just skip to the Extras (although there you'll find his full reading of ""I Know the Hole in Baby's Head"", which strongly hints at the dark real-life stuff in the film). Only some brief interviews with folks like Thurston Moore and ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons give the film any commonality with typical music docs.

Rather the film is a harrowing, painful and unblinking story of personal survival. It portrays, with incredible up-close intimacy, Erickson's lifelong schizophrenia and the chillingly dysfunctional and tragic family from which he has no means to distance himself. You'll find yourself amazed that he's still alive and getting by - in his own odd way - after all he's been through.

Most of the film documents Erickson's day-to-day life with his mother, and we soon realize she's as toxic a presence in his life as mental illness or state incarceration ever were. Think of the Pink Floyd song ""Mother"" and you'll have some clue about this woman, who is nonetheless a sympathetic figure herself. She plainly cares and means well. Most interestingly, she's very musical and artistic herself - and nearly as eccentric as her son is.

One of Roky's brothers (a classical musician) finally stages an intervention. A Texas court appoints the brother as Roky's sole guardian; at last getting him the proper treatment he so badly needs. While the film doesn't have a ""happy"" conclusion, at least it ends with Roky being much more stable and contented than he'd been in years. Those closest to Erickson describe him as always being very likable and sweet; and this quality still shines brightly forth from him despite everything. I very much wonder how he's doing today.",1219104000,5,2039,4.953216374269005

2807038,3,B000P0J060,"Roky Erickson and his band, the 13th Floor Elevators were  a 60's rock band that seemed on the cusp of great success. They achieved a small amount of fame and this was greatly due to the power of Roky Erickson's voice. (It's very easy to believe that Janis Joplin was greatly influenced by Erickson as the film contends.) As with many other bands of the era, the group experimented heavily with psychedelic drugs. When Roky combined rampant drug use along with a preexisting mental illness he began behaving much more erratically, and slowly began fading away from society.

""You're Gonna Miss Me.."" attempts to fill in what has happened to Roky in the twenty or so years since he disappeared from the public eye as well as show his current status. As it turns out, Erickson has been living in Austin under the care of his mother who has made him virtually unavailable to any other members of his family or doctors to help him with his illness. Indeed, one of the first times we see Roky today he is enraptured with a Mr. Potato Head doll. A huge rift has developed within his family, as it appears that Erickson's mother is also in dire need of some psychiatry as well. The creators of ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" have certainly chosen an interesting subject, and generally present it well. They did a fine job of capturing Roky, his living conditions, and his relationship with his mother. They also managed to locate more than enough footage throughout the years to document Roky's unraveling.

Despite the compelling material, there are a number of problems with the documentary. First, there is only passing attention paid to Erickson's father, brothers, or son. There was obviously much that had happened over the years between the family and Roky's mother that was not discussed during the documentary. I felt that those people had a lot to do with the story, but I was never allowed to really get to know them. There was even a remark made in passing during the film that Roky's father may have molested one or more of his sons, but for whatever reason the filmmakers chose not to investigate this further. The ending of the documentary left me wanting as well. There was a long period of time that Roky was in therapy and was taking medicine that the audience does not get to see. We jump from Roky being almost completely out of it to somewhat coherent months later. It would have been fascinating to see Erickson slowly reemerge. Although we get to see Roky pick up the guitar the guitar again, he clearly had a long way to go, and I'm sure the movie would have played better if the filmmakers had continued following Erickson for a while longer. (Luckily the dvd bonus materials help achieve that sense of closure the film lacks.)

The 13th Floor Elevators still have many fans today (some of them famous musician tons in their own right), and Erickson's fall into the depths of mental illness is an interesting and tragic one. The viewer can't help but feel that if the right actions had been taken at any number of critical times in Erickson's life that he might have avoided a large number of his problems.",1199145600,13,3116,4.6394927536231885
2807039,5,B000P0J060,"The story of Roky is complex to say the least.

But without the genius of Keven McAlester guiding this ship of a film, it could easily have been a disaster of nonsense. Instead, it is a gripping story that has viewers talking about it years after first seeing the film.

Roky was a special person who touched a lot of lives. He had to fight his demons for a long time. Some brought on my himself, others of which he had no control of. I wish it had been more current, as Roky has become touring again. But, for those who did not know all that went on during these times, it will be an interesting movie. For those that are new to Roky and the Elevators, be sure and find the ""Easter Everywhere"" album. It was as good an album for it's time as anything that was being done in the late 60's. As a group, they were miles ahead of anything going on in anywhere in the states.",1193270400,5,762,3.9869281045751634
2807041,4,B000P0J060,"A sort of 'Clockwork Orange' rock and roll documentary about Roky Erickson, lead singer of renowned late '60's garage band, 13th Floor Elevators, (who have gained deserving greater fame today than they did in their brief history), and his plunge into druggie mental illness and subsequent controlled sanity. It's another dysfunctional family documentary, like Terry Zwigoff's docu on underground comics writer, Robert ""Crumb"", where family members are revealed as social oddballs whose own sad turn of events rival the main pathos. Erickson was a heavy drug user, singled out by drug enforcement and finally busted on a marijuana charge and confined to a crude Texas mental institution for the criminally insane for three years, where, of course, he started a band, which included, for instance, a child killer on drums. Upon release he is a total social misfit, addicting The Cartoon Network as his new drug of choice. The film is not complete without the DVD extras which add a needed conclusion, (otherwise the skepticism is, once a heroin addict ...), but you'll have to decide if genius is lost between the pre-saved Erickson, reciting a harrowingly dark poem about family life in a drug induced stupor, and the post-saved rock 'n roller, likely to be found in a Starbucks signing autographs, and who the freaks are; the lunatic jumping the barbed wires of prison to go get high, or his symphonic tuba playing straight laced brother in a 'mommy loves me' session with his therapist.",1189382400,2,1487,5.048780487804878
2807042,4,B000P0J060,"Roky Erickson is/was crazy, right? Well...wait until you get a load of his mother. While I definitely do feel sorry for her, her lack of faith in psychiatry displayed in this film almost angers me. Who knows? Maybe Roky could've had a more lucrative career if it wasn't for some of the stuff that happened. If it wasn't for his courageous brother, we might've never even seen this film. Or a completely different/ultra-sad film. Either way, the ending will manage to both depress & make you happy at the same time. A little more live footage would've made this a 5 star DVD.",1186704000,3,574,4.58252427184466
2807043,1,B000P0J060,"This film is interesting in a family's treatment of a mentally person who really just happens to be famous. It's kind of like all the recent documentaries like Stevie and Capturing the Friedmans in this sense. Kind of makes you squirm kind of makes you watch on (I guess for some). But as an examination of a very talented person who fell on very hard times due to schizophrenia which may be genetic or may be pushed on by acid or shock treatment it left me feeling sad and empty. It shows everyone's view of Roky through their own self-interest. I think most people in this film have little understanding of mental illness. The seemingly sanest younger brother even blows it on his mentor's (and his belief too I'm sure) thoughts that Roky had to go mad because there was so much chaos on in the house so little lack of love. My guess is...probably not... given the mental illness of the mother and the symptoms of roky. Schizophrenia just doesn't manifest itself because there is too little love in the house. If so, many depressed people would become schizophrenics. I'd prefer just to hear Roky sing and watch some performances. I think he'd be happier with that too - with that being his legacy, as opposed this film which forces itself into his private world.",1186099200,9,1265,4.601769911504425
2807044,5,B000P0J060,"Not often do stories of the rock N roll greats of our time end as positive as Roky's. As a long time fan of his music (since I heard Burn The Flames in Return Of The Living Dead) I was really excited to hear about this documentary, which is so much more than just a documentary. Roky did get a bum rap when he was admitted at Rusk State Hospital, and despite his mothers efforts, he really had a hard time throughout the 80's and 90's. Luckily, Sumner, Roky's brother was there for him. You realy get a feel for how much of a caring person Roky's brother really is. If it weren't for Sumner, Roky might not be hear to share his music with us. While this story starts out kind of grim, it ends with Roky breaking free of his past demons, which were truly real to him. It brought a tear to my eye seeing Roky take the stage again for the first time in almost 20 years. The guy always had this sutble gentleness to him and his voice was always so pleasing to the ear, especially to me because I love Rock N Roll and Roky is very influential. I hope to hear a new album from him. At 60 years old, the future seems bright for Roky who, along with his brother Sumner, helps to maintain health and stamina, as well as promote Roky's return to music. This is a magical look at a tragic character who pulls through to prove to the world that you can turn your life around and defeat depression and schizophrenia( whch really doesnt even exist). I look forward to one day seeing Roky perform. I totally recommend this documentary, it is really awe-inspiring. Here's to your health and happiness Roky. Also, get The Evil One and Don't Slander Me as they are classic albums by this highly influential character.",1185062400,11,1699,4.29595015576324
2807045,5,B000P0J060,"This is a great DVD but too truly appreciate it you need to see the Extra Features Postscripts which show you exactly how Roky's story has ""ended"" happily for the moment. The funny thing is, too me Roky, other then looking disheveled, doesn't really sound all that nuts & came off alot more ""Normal"" then I thought he was, although you can totally recognize he was in a depressive state, for lack of a better word, compared to how he is today after his brother helped get him much healthier, mentally & physically. Without his mother's help beforehand, I doubt he could have survived, albeit she didn't steer him to proper psychiatric/medical help. I didn't realize his work after the Elevators was so good & as a result, I'm buying a collection of his ""Solo"" work too. I was under the wrong impression that he lost his musical ability after the Elevators because of his ""problems"", but it appears that is totally untrue as his stuff sounded great.",1184976000,7,948,4.648809523809524

8188001,5,B000P0J060,My brother has owned this since it came out & I finally saw it last weekend. I HIGHLY recommend this documentary on Rocky and his family but you can't stop at just the end of the movie! You must watch the extra footage showing his emancipation! You or anyone you know suffer from mental illness? This movie is for you! Now Thurston Moore and Gibby Haines don't belong in this documentary because they are ignorant people and their idiocy is exhibited in the clips that are shown. The casting director made a bad decision but overall this ROCKS!,1459296000,,544,4.561224489795919

Youre Gonna Miss Me chronicles the troubled life of singer Roky Erickson. Erickson is best known for bringing psychedelic rock to the masses in the mid-1960s with his group The 13th Floor Elevators, but his life took a strange left turn after he was arrested for drug possession in 1969 and pleaded insanity to avoid a ten year jail sentence. The plea was accepted, and Roky was sent to Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane for a three-year stay, where he was subjected to intense electroshock therapy that left him far worse off than he was before entering the facility. The bulk of the movie covers his ups and downs in the years following his release, which include bouts with schizophrenia, drug addiction, his strange relationship with his mother (who seems somewhat disturbed herself), and his sporadic musical output which was surprisingly strong despite all of his other problems. The story is interesting enough that you don't need to have any prior knowledge of Rokys music in order to enjoy it, but for those who are familiar with his work, the film gives new insight into the man behind it all. If you saw Youre Gonna Miss Me in the theater, the DVD is still recommended thanks for the wealth of bonus materials, including a segment which covers the five years after the completion of the movie, during which time Roky was placed into the custody of his brother who helped him get mentally and physically healthier than he had been for decades, enabling him to go back out on the road and perform for a new generation of adoring fans. It gives the harrowing story a happy ending that it wouldnt have otherwise had.",1451001600,,1702,4.848797250859106
8188003,3,B000P0J060,"Even though ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" is a choppy, disjointed documentary, the filmmaker manages to keep it interesting with old clips, comments from Billy Gibbons, Patti Smith, family members, and former Elevators bandmates. Poor editing may have omitted many important details, and sadly, as a result, more mystery pops up than was likely intended. Is Roky's whole family cursed by mental illness? Why does Roky's father seem more like a vegetable than his non-medicated, acid-casualty son? Is anyone including his mother and brother truly acting in Roky's best interests? At his age, does he really want to be burdened by stardom, or would he rather be making music in relative obscurity?

Still, my biggest question remains....Was the filmmaker intruding on Roky Erickson's privacy in the making of this film? Was Roky too polite to refuse, or was he too distracted to care? A good deal of this documentary shows him shuffling around his apartment in partial squalor. Was this footage really necessary in getting a better understanding of Roky Erickson? To me, it just confirms the fact that ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" asks more questions than it gives answers.",1448323200,4,1158,5.126984126984127
