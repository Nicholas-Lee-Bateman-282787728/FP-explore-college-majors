1261709,5,B00003BE37,IT WAS EXCELLENT. VERY HOT! HOT! HOT! IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES OF THE CONCERT I SAW IN NOVEMBER '99.,951782400,4,105,4.3
1261710,5,B00003BE37,"Recently I've got three music DVDs of Mariah Carey/#1's, George Michael/Greatest Hits Collection and this, which definitely IS the best. The show was so well prepared and exciting that I could watch this three  times a day. I can say I was totally mesmerized by the Latin pop. Ricky did  a great performance with his unique and wonderful dancing and of course his  lovely BIG smile. The special minutes with Jose Feliciano and Santana was a  sweet moment also. His explanation about his country and earlier career  with rare footage was impressive. I think this must be even better than the  previously released DVD(""Video Collection"").
The video/audio  quality is great. One disappointment is that the running time is too  short(only 45min). So I want more of Ricky Martin. Ricky, I want your  concerts in Korea!",950400000,9,813,4.962962962962963
1261711,5,B00003BE37,I received this video as a gift but I had wanted it for a long time.  I purchased his video collection and that was great.  This video shows how good he is in concert and just how cute he really is!  His performance is  great and it shows how great his stage presence is.  I only wish I could  have been there in person.  The behind-the-scenes footage and where he  personally talks is also great to see!  Buy this if you really love Ricky  Martin!,949017600,12,448,4.1647058823529415
1261712,5,B00003BE37,"I was personally there at the Live taping of the concert and the video is just as spectacular as the taping,especially when they showed the part where he sang,""Woke up in New York City"".You couldn't see the  effect until you saw the Special on TV or the video. This is definitely a  Ricky Martin Fan must have item.",945561600,31,315,4.413793103448276
1261713,5,B00003BE37,Ricky Martin is the best don't ... Ricky has a great voice and his songs are very well written. And he's very handsome too!,945475200,5,123,4.166666666666667
1261790,5,B00003BE37,"I remember watching this on TV and taped it them.  Somewhere along the way I lost the tape and finally found it on here.  It is a FANTASTIC show!!!  A must have for anyone...no caveats, just anyone who likes music!",1257811200,,214,4.3
1261791,5,B00003BE37,"Wonderful Concert outdoors in front of twin towers
Gorgeous dancing by Ricky & dancers WOO HOO
Really enertaining! Wonderful sound & singing
Beautiful Ricky Martin keepsake",1204675200,,172,5.653846153846154
1261792,5,B00003BE37,"Wow the whole show was entertaining. It felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with Ricky, the dancers and the band. The whole concert was great and really entertaining, it felt so much like Carnivale.",1073088000,6,223,4.6
1261793,5,B00003BE37,"Originally I had seen this on TV.  I now own the DVD.  It is about 45 minutes long and it is very lively.  Let's face it, Ricky Martin is not the best singer out there but he is the most entertaining dancer I have ever seen.
I absolutely love this DVD.  It is also sort of nice that it is less than one hour.  I can always manage to squeeze in an hour of viewing just about any time of the week.",1045699200,2,395,3.768292682926829
1261794,5,B00003BE37,"What can I say?  Wow....this DVD is stunning! I picked this up at the video store because I like Ricky's music. Being a video freak I then started to take it back because I later discovered that it's not widescreen. I'm really glad that I didn't.
I saw this live on my old television set, but since my new HDTV and 5.1 Surround Sound purchase, I wanted to view it on DVD. The quality of the video and audio is outstanding, and it really gives you the feeling that you are on the front row of a live concert in New York City.
The background for this concert is the New York City Skyline with the Twin Towers in all their glory. Time of day changes with the beginning songs in full daylight and continuing as the sun sets and the skyline becomes beautifully lighted. There's a couple of songs with legends Jose' Feliciano and Carlos Santana and Ricky sings all of his upbeat easy to dance to latin hits. But my personal favorite is his love ballad, ""She's all I Ever Had"".
It ends up with a fireworks display out in the harbor but the real fireworks happen on stage. He's one of very few singers who can actually dance as well as sing. And even though my last name is Martin, I'm not related to Ricky in any way (wish I were). So if you like his music buy this one. You won't regret it.",1011225600,10,1284,4.198380566801619
1261795,5,B00003BE37,I had the honor of being there and it was the happiest day of my life!! The video is beautiful and it expresses everything he wanted to say about himself and our beautiful island! Lucy,997488000,2,184,4.285714285714286
1261796,5,B00003BE37,"Despite the thousands attending the concert Ricky seems to have a personal bond with each person in the audience. That comes through on the video also. You feel like you are seated in the best seat watching this  spectacular show. And spectacular it is! With bungee jumpers, fabulous  dancers and backup singers and unbelievable musicians Ricky puts out a  first class production",963014400,6,379,5.080645161290323
1261797,5,B00003BE37,"If you're as unfortunate as I am to not have seen Ricky Martin live in concert before your own eyes, then this is the next best thing!  It really shows how talented Ricky is, to all you non-believers: he's much more than  a pretty face believe me!  He dances non-stop all the time and sings both  his English hits Livin' la vida loca, She's all.., Shake your bon-bon and  Spanish hits such as Mar&iacute;a, Copa de la vida and Lola, Lola plus a great  trio with Santana and Jos&eacute; Feliciano.  And this is what I really like about  this VHS/DVD: You can really see him up close, the cameras aren't swinging  back and forth and up and down or focusing on the audience, they're on  Ricky 95% of the time!  The sound is very good so the power in the drums  and the horns (the band is great!) and of course in Ricky's voice comes  very well across. I also like the short bits in between the songs which  show Ricky singing with little kids or walking the streets of Puerto Rico.  And it doesn't hurt to see him in those Armani outfits, Oh my GOD!  If you  really like Kiki but are afraid of buying VHS/DVD with bad quality, don't  be afraid about this one because this tape is as good as it gets. BUY IT  NOW!",960336000,25,1209,4.223684210526316

1261799,5,B00003BE37,"I just want to say that the dvd I watched was incredible. i mean it is kind of impossible to use an adjective to describe how fantastiv it was to me. The quality was perfect (Audio/Video). But really short I expected more  time. But well the real perfume comes in small bottles! so to sum it up if  you are a real fan you must get it now. by watching it you will dance, sing  and feel as if you were in the best seat in front of the concert!, yeah,  believe i am the biggest fan of ricky in lima, peru i have all the three  dvd's of ricky martin ""the ricky martin video collection"",  ""one night only"",and.....""it's a crazy life"" all these  videos were bought from amazon.",957484800,20,671,4.155038759689923

I remembered watching the television special and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ricky is full of energy, sounds great and of course he looks great too.  The concert is great fun.",1433808000,,291,4.538461538461538
