8268316,5,6304595344,"I must admit that the action and thriller genre of the movie scene is not generally my choice because of the excess shooting, blood, gore, and profane language that abound in most of these flicks;however, A PRAYER IN  THE DARK provides a refreshing change.  The movie contains enough violence  to make the plot seem plausible, yet the crux of the movie is devoted to  finding a nonviolent solution to the family's hostage situation.  Lynda  Carter gives a powerful performance as a Quaker who truly believes in  focusing on the positive qualities in all people.  After numerous backsets  in her character's plans to resolve the situation, one of her adversaries  makes the comment that after all they have been through she is still trying  to keep everyone safe.
Some critics may charge that this doesn't depict  real life.  I say--WHY CAN'T THIS BE REAL LIFE?  We see so many people in  our society imitating the violence from movies.  Maybe someone will see  this movie and realize there are better things to imitate.
This is one of  the best movies that I have seen in a long time.  Lynda Carter and the  remainder of the cast give stellar performances.  Top-notch writing,  directing, producing, and cinematography are strong points of this movie as  well.

8268317,5,6304595344,"This movie was certainly a thriller, but not to satisfy those looking just for cheap blood and guts.  Most of the action is mental/emotional effort, though there were scenes of physical violence.
How do you handle  violence to yourself and your family when you truly believe that all men  (and women) are your brothers and your personal commitment is to do  violence to noone.
The plot is credible and complex.  The acting was for  the most part good with moments supreme. The story leaves one looking  inward with the serious question,""What would I have done?""
This movie should be made available more generally.",921024000,6,613,4.893203883495145
