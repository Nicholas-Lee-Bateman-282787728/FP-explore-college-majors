4109262,4,B003CJXJ5E,"Jon Hamm does a great job here as a detective whose son goes missing and who also ends up investigating another case of a missing boy from 50 years earlier.  Much of the movie is given in flashbacks, while the present shows what a strain the detective is under because of the conflicts with his wife and his own strong feelings.

James van der Beek, a long way from Dawson's Creek, also turns in a good performance as a hired hand who knows something about the 1958 case.

4109263,5,B003CJXJ5E,"I watched this movie expecting to see an ordinary murder mystery. Instead, I was deeply moved by the story of one man's journey to redemption and the unbearable grief a father sustains at the tragic loss of his child under circumstances that lead the fatheer to blame himself.

A policeman (actor John Hamm)investigates the discovery of a child's body in a box in the foundation of a 50 year old building and determines that the death of the child is connected to the disappearance of his small boy ten years before. Meanwhile, a parallel story is occurring some 50 years before to another man (actor Josh Lucas) and the disappearance of his small boy. In each cases the father took his eyes off of his child for a short time and in each case the child disappeared, never to be found.

Now, the detective searches for what happened to the boy in the box, hoping to somehow find his son alive. As the suspense builds and the two stories begin to head toward an intersection, the emotional intensity of the movie takes it from an ordinary whodunnit to tour de force of the power of love, grief, and reconciliation.

The acting is superb, the directing is gifted, and the simplicity of the various settings and characters remind me of another great movie based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize winning ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".",1269129600,39,1321,4.660944206008583

4109265,2,B003CJXJ5E,"This movie had okay cinematography but it was over-acted and the plot seems contrived (WARNING: BAD MOVIE SPOILER ALERT!) It takes a while to get going and once it did, I already figured the ending out. Maybe I've just watched too many mysteries and crime shows so I know what to expect. Even so, the ending was way too obvious and even if I had not figured it out, I still would not have been happy with the resolution. I don't like having a mystery spelled out for me and this movie involved no critical thinking skills. It seems like it was meant to be a mystery-thriller but the problem is...it's not mysterious or thrilling in the least. I would call this movie a crime drama because it literally tells you everything and it comes off more like a true crime show but it isn't nearly as satisfying.

The movie focuses on two fathers, one modern day cop that had his son vanish 8 years ago. The other father is seen in flashbacks from 1950's and his missing son is found in a box buried in cement many years later. This could have been a great premise for a mystery-thriller...Cop with missing son tries to solve the 50 year old murder of another man's young son...not such a bad idea...The writers just were not creative enough to fill in the blanks with likable characters, believable actors and a story that is interesting. A good mystery usually isn't action-packed and I expect somewhat of a slower pace and more detail than an action movie...but this movie just dragged and anytime it tried to be suspenseful, it just didn't deliver. It wasn't an action movie but it wasn't a ""thinking"" type of movie either.

A good mystery story should make you think and keep you guessing. It should have a few red herrings, clues and a reason to care about the characters. This movie had none of that. The splitting of the stories and the back and forth flashbacks make the movie seem choppy and you never really feel fully connected to either character. The cop is emotionless and stoic one minute and emo the next. His character makes no sense. Then we get the stereotypical ""gorgeous but hurt wife who is ready to get a divorce"" sub-plot where the missing son is ruining the couple's marriage and the dad won't empty out the son's old room...Gee, I didn't see that one coming! And let me guess, they try to work things out in the end? Could this movie be more clich?

The wife and the husband also look YEARS apart in age to the point of it being laughable. The son went missing 8 years ago and he was ten at that time. That means the couple has been together 18 years. Rhona Mitra is gorgeous but his movie was made in 2009! In real life she would have been 32 or 33 when this movie was filmed but she looks well under 30. I won't fault a woman for having great skin (I am a huge fan of Rhona, I love her style!) but I will say that someone should have considered that on camera, she looks about 10-12 years TOO YOUNG to have a son who is 18! If the guy looks like he is in his 40's, the wife should look about the same age. She looks more like his daughter than his wife. In one of the very first scenes in the movie, husband and wife are lying in bed together and his face clearly looks a lot older than hers and this scene honestly comes off as a little creepy.

The ""flashback"" dad from the 1950's you never really feel that sorry for because he is an idiot and in real life he probably would have asked ""Gee, who was the ONLY one who knew my kid would be alone that night?"" What parent acts like this? He goes around frantically looking for his son, doesn't suspect the OBVIOUS person that the audience has already identified if they have a brain, THEN we're supposed to believe he just gave up looking and told the rest of the family that he sent the boy to a mental asylum. A good parent doesn't go frantically searching, then suddenly say ""Oh well"" and lie about it. How are we supposed to feel sympathy for a father who hardly even looked for his missing boy? He doesn't care about his own kid but somehow the audience magically should.

Did these writers ever watch true crime shows where real parents are sobbing 30 and 40 years later saying, ""I still want to know what happened to my baby, I will never stop looking!"" or did the writers just pull this ""poor 50's dad"" character out of their butt at random? Very little was done to build sympathy for either dad. We feel sorry for the kids but it almost feels like the writers were exploiting the subject of child abduction just for the sake of using it to make a movie. They didn't do a lot to convey the real sadness, the emptiness and the loss that parents must feel when they go through something so horrible. The movie is almost insulting in the sense that it just glosses over these heinous crimes, gives us nice looking actors and lines that sound ""written"" but it doesn't touch the deep human emotions of what it really means to NOT know what happened to a loved one. The story gets thrown in our faces like ""This is what happened"" but we don't really find out why and we don't get to see justice done in the end.

Both main characters seem dim-witted. You would think a cop would be more observant, tougher and that he would figure out the mystery before the audience does. THEN, the plot drags on even more and takes us by the hand, explaining everything that happened as if we are little kids. The movie also shows us exactly what happened in flashback form and the audience knows before the detective figures it all out. Why bother having a hero detective in a movie when the audience is smarter than he is? Every mystery must have the ""Ah HA!"" moment but by the time that rolls around in this movie, I was like ""Yeah, yeah...I knew who it was already.""

The cop goes mental when the news headline reads ""Boy in the Box"" instead of being happy that the case is getting the attention of the media and might turn up leads. Like, what is so offensive about it? Cops deal with the media all the time and have to see gruesome things every day. The cop freaks out and goes emo over it saying, ""He is a person, NOT a boy in a box!"" Um...excuse me Mr. cop...you uncovered the skeleton of a boy...and that boy was in a box. Should the headline have been, ""Unknown young person found in wooden container underground"" or was this just a scene put in there to attempt to tug the heart strings of the audience and convince us this character is secretly sensitive and bothered by his own missing son? Well, it failed...this audience member wanted the cop to stop whining and get back on the case.

Many of the scenes were over-acted and the ""boy in the box"" freak-out scene was the crowning example in this movie. A real cop would have better crap to worry about than the media's choice of headlines.  The tough as nails detective I wanted to see is the guy who goes, ""Boy in a box? Great...it's a tacky headline but maybe the article will bring us some new leads. Let's get back to work and solve this thing!"" The detective in this movie obviously isn't that guy. It would build sympathy if the hardened cop cried over the thought of his own son ending up like the ""boy in the box"" but it doesn't make sense for him to go emo over the headline and complain about how `offended' he is to the reporter. A real man CAN cry and that can be very powerful in a movie. But instead of a good crying scene, he berates the press over a headline when they are the ones trying to help him get the story out there. Cops see things like murder, rape, drugs and the worst of humanity. It would probably take a lot more than a news headline to offend a cop.

The movie is also very somber which is to be expected but the audience isn't rewarded at the end. The resolution wasn't satisfying AT ALL! When the cop finally grows a pair and figures out what is going on, we don't get to see a good climax in the end. We get to see the cop punch the bad guy, when the bad guy already looks 100 years old (in really obvious bad makeup and painted on tattoos) limping and shackled in prison. Honestly, this is a pathetic ""climax"" to an already bland and boring movie. The audience would love to see a child killer fried in an electric chair, shot in the head by cops for trying to escape, or sentenced to a billion years in prison where he gets molested in the shower by inmates daily...But NO! We get to see a cop punch the guy, knowing the cop will probably be sued for it and knowing the guy is already in jail and will croak shortly anyway. We don't even get to SEE the bad guy croak. His jaw isn't even broken. What a lousy ending! Of all the possible endings, why did the writers pick THIS one?

This movie is a basic mystery-drama and it would have been better chopped down to an hour long show and written as an episode for a popular crime TV series. There wasn't enough ""meat"" in the story to make a full movie. Audiences have seen a lot when it comes to mystery/thriller/crime mash-ups. Sometimes they work, other times they don't. We've also seen a lot in the way of ""child abduction"" movies and if someone is going to make a hit movie in a tired genre, that means coming up with something original. A good full-length movie needs some type of twist or something to keep the attention of the audience. This movie lacked that special spark that a good mystery-thriller movie should have.  It's kind of like someone watched a few true crime shows then made up some forgettable character names and called it a movie script.

This was not a horrible train wreck movie, it was just forgettable. It's one of those movies that had potential and probably looked good on paper but in the end, it just didn't come out good on screen. I could picture this as an obscure TV show episode but it probably wouldn't even be interesting enough for CSI or one of the really popular shows. It might have even been an interesting idea for a book and given a lot more potential for character development and suspense. A book might have also been able to get inside the minds of the main characters and make them less one-dimensional.  The problem with splitting a story 50/50 in a movie is that we're only getting 50% of each character and that is 100% lame. Two stories in one movie can be awesome but this should have either been more the cop's movie, or the 50's father's movie. To try to shove both stories into the spotlight equally just didn't work.

This movie is a fine example of the ""cookie cutter"" movies that Hollywood cranks out on a conveyor belt every time a particular genre has a big hit. If you want a riveting, edge-of-your-seat child abduction mystery, there are much better ones out there and they were made ages ago. If you want a crime-thriller movie, watch something else. On a final note, if you really are interested in watching ""Stolen"" you are going to have a LOT of fun finding it because it shares this unoriginal title with several other movies and books. Maybe a few people will actually get lucky and click on the wrong thing and find something way more entertaining than this boring dreck!",1385164800,4,11049,4.346414728682171

This movie featured two of my favorite actors -- Jon Hamm and Josh Lucas.
While this movie is about the horrific subject of child abductions and murders, the focus is necessarily on how each father copes and survives.
For me Josh Lucas' character is more memorable and touching because he is a genuinely good man put in an impossible situation and forced to endure yet another gut-wrenching loss.
How and why anyone would abduct and murder a child is not explained to my satisfaction in this movie.  I guess that explanation would be another movie in itself.

4109274,4,B003CJXJ5E,"When you watch a lot of independent and direct-to-video films, you see a lot of garbage, but occasionally you find a gem that makes it all worthwhile, Stolen, is one of those gems. This story was so intriguing and well written that I was absolutely blown away. The film is about a detective whose son went missing, without a trace, eight years ago. The trail is cold and he's beginning to accept that he will never find him, when a local construction crew finds a boy in a box. The body has been there for at least fifty years, but the case awakens something in the detective who has to learn the truth. From there, quite ingeniously, the film is divided into three different stories, the story of the boy in the box, the detectives investigation, and the story of his own child. It was seriously like watching three different movies at once, and they were all great! The cast was pretty phenomenal too, as this was a very hard thing to pull off, but they did it seemingly with ease. Josh Lucas just blew my mind, giving an unrivaled performance as the father of the other missing boy. I've seen him in things before, but nothing was as memorable as this. Stolen is a film that consists of three stories in once, that will pull on your emotions and have you on the edge of your seat.

To make it even better, it's the story of the loss of two children decades apart, that dovetail into each other.

4109278,5,B003CJXJ5E,"To be honest, I watched this movie because I wanted to see Jon Hamm from ""Mad Men"" in a movie.  However, I am a mystery buff and I soon concentrated on the story itself. The story is somewhat low-key, but excellently done.  I appreciated that it was not overhyped and that it had a realistic ending.  Not all endings have to be cliffhangers.  It was based on a true story.  Jon Hamm plays a police detective whose son went missing eight years ago at age 10.  He bears the guilt of having left him for a few minutes and came back to find him missing.  He has searched all these years and it has become an obsession, endangering his marriage.  A body is found at a construction site and at first it is thought to be his son because of similar items packed in the box with him  However, this skeleton is felt to be at least 50 years old. So the detective works this case not only for the family out there missing a child all these years, which he can identify with, but in hopes of finding his son.  In solving this crime, it does lead to the resolution of what happened to his son.  It felt gritty and realistic to me and the acting was excellent.  To the man who could not figure out the flashbacks, it is true that Jon Hamm and Josh Lucas look a lot alike and that may have been confusing as it flashed back and told the story leading up to when the first boy went missing.  They were two separate men who lived at different times, but looked a lot alike.",1342051200,2,1455,4.1535714285714285
4109279,3,B003CJXJ5E,"This is very well done but do not get it if you're looking for slasher-variety gore, as its advertising suggests.

4109280,3,B003CJXJ5E,"Tom Adkins (Jon Hamm) is a detective. His son goes missing. After 8 years they find the body of a child buried at a construction site. The boy is not Tom's son but that of a child that died 50 years ago. The movie flashes back to 1958 and builds that story for us. The movie then bounces back and forth in time to tell the story of the incident and the investigation. Tom Adkins suspects Bert Rogianni (James Van Der Beek), a man in prison serving time for the same type of crime.

The film uses long scenes showing faces while playing a slow piano tune as an attempt to make us feel sad. It also peeks at the incident causes a rift between Tom and his wife (Rhona Mitra). The editing could have been better. The DVD cover calls it a ""thriller,"" but I found that the slow moving crime drama mystery lacked thrills. It is a movie about the obsession Tom has to find his son and how it destroys his life, but the theme wasn't well developed.

4109281,3,B003CJXJ5E,"Stolen is about a man who takes his son to a diner and after using the bathroom, he comes back and discovers that his son is missing. From here, panic obviously sets in, and the storyline is underway.

What makes Stolen a pretty confusing film is the way it jumps around from when the father was spending time travelling around town searching for work and a place to live with his son (along with his other children) and back to current times and the ongoing investigation in search for clues pertaining to *anything* concerning the disappearance of his son.

Unfortunately, the plotline jumped around from past events to current events at *such* an awkward and clumsy pace that I honestly spent most of my time questioning what exactly was going on. As a result, I *think* I understand the ending (at least the film wrapped up THAT in a logical and easy to understand way) but many of the other events went completely over my head.

First of all -I realize this makes me look like an idiot- but what exactly was going on with the investigator and the father? Were they the same person the whole time? Somewhere along the way I had to stop and ask myself ""Are they one at the same?"" I wasn't able to differentiate the two men, and that's just... weird, haha.

You see, since the storyline would constantly jump around from the past when the father was spending time with his son, to a man searching for clues pertaining to a little boy who disappeared many years earlier, they both appeared to be the same exact man but... that can't be correct because it would lead to an inaccurate portrayal of a main character.  In other words, if they were the same man, for some highly unusual reason, he didn't age at all.  Something about the storyline completely confused me here.  Hmmm...

I get the feeling watching the film a second time won't make it any easier to understand either- I need someone to literally spell it out for me and tell me what actually was going on the entire time.  Then throw in the wife and... wow, now it gets significantly more difficult to grasp the storyline.

I can't spoil the ending because that's a jerk-ish thing to do when writing a movie review, but the very final segment didn't make a bit of sense to me, and this is because of the man and his wife.  Without spoiling what happened, the fact *she* made an appearance at the very end -and didn't age at all- is another confusing element to the movie and causing more aggravation for me.

Besides that, the film has its share of dry spells pertaining to the storyline with too much unnecessary drama and pointless conversations making it feel more like a film appropriate for the Hallmark Channel.",1310688000,2,2679,4.546777546777546

The sub plot, which takes place 50 years earlier, is at least a little interesting. The two plots develop (or not) and then at the end when you realize how they are connected, it's completely anti-climactic. I thought Jon Hamm would save it, but no. The only redeeming quality is Josh Lucas, the main character in the sub plot. He's the best part of this movie and an actor that I hope to see more.

The script was weak.. the lines were hokey and unmoving, though over-acted for drama and forced pain.  The kid from the 50's that goes missing was poorly acted.  Lots of continuity errors in hair, dress, actions, photos.  I guess if you'd never lived in the 50's/60's, you'd never think of this stuff, but it ruined it for me in the flash-backs.

Be forewarned though, this story of abducted and missing children is very, very grim. The acting is quite good, and the technique of telling this story, switching back & forth between two time lines, is done decently.  The movie is a bit slow as others have commented, but given the subject matter, this only adds to the sense of terror and despair.  This movie relates to a narrow range of people who have had these horrifying kinds of experiences thrust upon them. For the rest of us, it is nothing short of our worst fear as parents, and this film will leave most of us greatly disturbed.  Two stars for the acting and directing, but the subject of the film was too overwhelming for me.  I had to put on a kinder, more upbeat movie right away.

There are so many movies out there where the actors don't appear to feel anything deep enough, like love  or heartbreak or desperation; consequently neither can the audience. This story of these two fathers who so very much love their sons is well-done, with excellent acting by both Josh and Jon. For the most part, the transition from one time setting to the next is easy to follow; a fact that is so important in these kinds of movies.  Contrary to what some others have said, the manner in which the incident takes place in 1958 is both tense and disturbing because this father does not have anyone who cares, to help him look for his son, and Josh's performance as a distraught father is so well done that it's upsetting to watch.  Rhonda Mitra is good in her role, also. In fact, if a person really gets involved in the story, as opposed to looking for ways to tear it apart, the whole picture and all the characters work well together. The picture does start out slowly, but then, it's not a fast-action movie to begin with, and the manner in which the two stories gradually come together help to make it a film worth watching.",1290643200,2,1184,4.472222222222222

Blu-Ray being released June 29, 2010

""Stolen"" was directed by Anders Anderson and written by Glenn Taranto. It stars Jon Hamm as Detective Tom Adkins who in investigating his own son's disappearance comes across the body of another boy who was stolen from his father, Matthew Wakefield played by Josh Lucas in 1958. The story goes back and forth between the two as the Detective closes in on the truth of what happened to them.

This story is much more about Matthew Wakefield than Tom Adkins. We follow Wakefield as he falls into a downward spiral about to lose his house, losing his wife, having to send two of his sons to live with family, and trying to find and keep a job while taking care of his third son with special needs. He finally nabs a construction job, but that quickly falls into jeopardy when given the ultimatum by his boss that he can't bring young John with him to work any longer.

Tom Adkins loses his son early on in the film when young Tom, Jr. disappears from a diner they were eating in while Tom, Sr. was in the restroom. For eight years, the burden of the loss eats away at Tom and at his marriage with his wife, Barbara played by Rhona Mitra. Tom will not allow his son's room to be touched so it is left just as it was and the constant reminder of their son's absence tortures both parents.

Both men lost their sons around the same age and both deal with their absence/death painfully by staring into space with intensity as the strong, silent types. In the uneven storytelling and the flaws that both men carried in relation to how Wakefield acted before his son disappeared and how Adkins acted afterward to his family, while it was easy to imagine how difficult the loss would be to any parent, I didn't care particularly for either of them. Both instances happened very quickly and both men were partially to blame for the circumstances.

The movie jumps around just when you're beginning to get into one story or the other. The most disappointing aspect of the movie is its predictability. At no point in time was the identity of the villain doubtful to a point where I almost thought it HAD to be someone else, but no, it was the obvious choice. The selection for casting was an interesting one, but that lent to the transparency of the big reveal. The ending creeps up for a lightning fast resolution and felt anticlimactic since again, the whole course of events was anticipated.

""Stolen"" isn't as dramatic of a thriller who-dun-it as it could have been, but anyone who is a fan of these types of child victim/kidnapping stories for the heart-wrenching factor might still enjoy this, especially if you are a fan of ""Mad Men.""

Bonus Features:

There is a trailer and a making of featurette where cast members Jon Hamm, Josh Lucas, James Van Der Beek, and Rhona Mitra as well as the young actor who plays John Wakefield, Jimmy Bennett. They talk about the challenging emotions and themes the story puts upon them and how the who-dun-it mystery unfolds and is pretty average as far as making-of's go.",1283817600,3,3046,4.565934065934066

Despite the grim subject matter, it was not tense or disturbing. It is definitely worth watching once.

There are some elements of the movie that bothered me. I was never convinced by the killer's motivation--if he really even had one. Do police officers and reporters often work crime scenes together? Why were things always spilling, dropping, breaking, and slipping away (coffee, batter, etc.)? What was it in the water that made most of the men plain and all of the women beautiful--Morena Baccarin as a lonely wife of a gas station owner!?

Although not an especially memorable movie, your time spent watching it will not be wasted.",1279929600,3,853,6.041322314049586
4109290,3,B003CJXJ5E,"This was a good idea. A detective's son is kidnapped and after 8 years another boy's body shows up at a construction site. The problem is this boy's been dead for 50 years. But the detective sees similarities in the two cases so he's all over it. The movie then volleys between the story of the old murder and the detective's investigation of his own son's case.

This is an intriguing premise on the surface but it doesn't come off. The movie is a slow ride and some of the plot elements, such as Josh Lucas' hooking up with a married woman with a violent husband, just don't make sense. Then there's the climax. This is the scene where everything is supposed to come together and it falls flat. This is a poorly written scene containing some skewed logic and it felt lousy that I had to sit through this slowness to get to this scene and be fed this garbage.

The acting is decent though nobody is really straining their milk. The production values, music, etc. are all decent. This fails at the script level. I gave it 3 stars but it could easily slide back to 2 and a half. If you think you want to see a movie like this try reaching for Gone Baby Gone. It's much better.",1278028800,6,1175,4.288288288288288
4109291,4,B003CJXJ5E,"STOLEN is a small budget film that deals with a major problem - loss of a child by abduction and the desperate need to find that child despite the passage of many years. Writer Glenn Taranto and Director Anders Anderson present two cases of kidnapping and murder, space them fifty years apart and interconnect the two stories in a way that is both disturbing psychologically and confusing as a film.  It works on many levels and the absence of information about motivation interferes with allowing this movie to be more powerful.

Ten years ago police officer Tom Adkins, Sr (Jon Hamm) left his only son Tom Jr. in a diner for a moment, only to return and find him missing.  His abilities as a law enforcement officer and his guilt as a 'negligent' father erodes his life and his marriage to Barbara (Rhona Mitra): he is unable to give up the search for his missing son despite the ten years of absence, a factor that practically drives his marriage to divorce.  A body is found in a box and Tom Sr immediately thinks it is his son, but investigation reveals that it is the body of a child that has been dead for fifty years.  The film then begins a series of flashbacks to a story fifty years ago when a young father Matthew Wakefield (Josh Lucas), having lost all of his money and home and facing the resultant suicide of his wife decides he must place his three children with relatives: one son, John (Jimmy Bennett), is mentally challenged, and Matthew's relatives will only take the two 'normal' boys, leaving John to live with his unemployed father.  Matthew finds a room for the two of them and begins works at a construction site, John tags along to be with his dad - a problem for the boss of the construction site.  Matthew forms friends with Diploma (James Van Der Beek) and Swede (Holt McCallany), is diverted by a sexual liaison, and during that time John is abducted.  We lose track of Matthew at this point, but jumping back to the present the discovered boy's body proves to be John Wakefield and this discovery consumes Tom Sr to uncover the murderer of the Wakefield boy, hoping that in some way it ties in with the disappearance of his own son. The plot becomes a bit murky at this point and a bit to 'rush to climax', but needless to say the murders are connected and Tom Sr and his wife are able to come to grips with the fact that Tom Jr is lost forever.

The film is shot in a a somewhat sepia color when dealing with the murder of fifty years ago and remains dusty appearing through the present - not unlike the soil that has hidden the uncovered truths so well.  The acting is fine, with some very fine cameo appearances by Johanna Cassidy as Tom Sr.'s mother and Jessica Chastain and Rose Montgomery as the feminine influences.  The makeup artists have done the film a disservice as they try to age people fifty years as the film winds down: to say more would be to give away the ending.  But the reason the film works is the commitment behind relating these tragedies on the part of all concerned.  It is especially noteworthy in that it is the work of a relatively inexperienced writer and director.  Grady Harp, June 10",1277683200,,3148,4.471204188481676

4109293,3,B003CJXJ5E,"""Stolen"" is a story about Detective Tom Adkins' (Jon Hamm) obsession with finding the killer of his ten year old son.  His son disappeared without a trace eight years ago and Tom cannot let go of his memories.  He keeps his son's room as it was that day, nothing has changed. He and his wife have put their lives on hold until there is a resolution to what happened to their son.  A suspect in prison will not confess, and will soon be released. Tom has interrogated him several times and is now asked to stay away as his anger and suspicions become non-productive harassment.

As the film opens, a body of a boy brutally murdered in 1958 is uncovered at a construction site, and because two clues seem familiar to both cases, Tom becomes obsessed with investigating this cold case.  He finds that the boy murdered belonged to a unemployed family man who recently lost his wife.  There is a gut feeling that somehow the two boys' deaths are connected and Tom is the hound of heaven leaving no rock unturned.  Even if he can prove a connection to the deaths, can he handle the truth.",1276819200,,1082,4.461928934010152
