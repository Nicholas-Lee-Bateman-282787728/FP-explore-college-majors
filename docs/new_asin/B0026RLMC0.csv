3856865,5,B0026RLMC0,I got this to keep my 7 year old grandson happy when he visits.  He will watch this for hours if you  aren't careful.,1411084800,,117,3.8333333333333335
3856866,5,B0026RLMC0,Ice Road 3 was just as great and enjoyable as the other two. Can't stop watching it when you start.,1400976000,,99,4.0
3856867,5,B0026RLMC0,Excellent Series to watch in the evening. It is fun to follow their stories on the road and who they are as well.,1391385600,,113,3.9565217391304346
3856868,5,B0026RLMC0,Our uncle enjoys the Ice Trucker series and he has Season One and Two DVDs so this completed his set!,1389657600,,101,4.1
3856869,5,B0026RLMC0,great information on ice road truckers and what they do and what type of weather conditions they go through and how they act and be competitive with one another when delivering their loads on the haul road.,1383091200,,206,4.594594594594595
3856870,2,B0026RLMC0,It's a great season that had me on the edge of my seat but I didn't like the fact that Hugh and Alex were treated practically like dirt by the Carlile truckers especially when that Jack with the white mustache got frustrated and decided to abandon Alex which no one should EVER abandon their convoy partner and if the weather was going to be bad Jack should of at least been smart enough to let Alex know to sit tight until it passes over since he is the one training him. Plus the things Jack said about Alex when he got frustrated with him chaining up if I were Alex I would have tore that man a new one! Just proves that Americans are less patient and are more interested in their own self gratification than the well being of their convoy partners. It also proves that Americans like to make the world think they are better at everything and the rest of the world is unintelligent compared to their superiority over the rest of the world by seeing how the people at Carlile train the Canadian truckers and made them appear dumber on the show when actually it's the other way around. I never liked Alaska nor did I care about their haul road they make a big deal out of. Seriously all it was is driving on ice/snow covered pavement which a third grader can do. Canada is where the real ice roads are because they actually drive on an ICE ROAD over most of the time a large body of water and Hugh and Alex are the real ice road truckers not the Alaskan wannabees.,1382659200,,1465,4.273381294964029
3856871,5,B0026RLMC0,Now I have season three and four.  I enjoy watching them again.  Alex and Jack are the best with Lisa a close second.  Can't wait each year for the new season.,1382227200,,159,4.064516129032258
3856872,5,B0026RLMC0,"It's a great show to watch to see just how dangerous and vital a job these men who drive through the thick of winter, slick roads to keep those in need supplied, especially the oil fields and the native villages.  Could learn a thing or two about driving on winter roads back in the lower 48",1380931200,,291,4.196428571428571
3856873,4,B0026RLMC0,Shows you how much you need to know to drive on these crazy roads -- mechanical expertise is a must.  I wonder if I'm the only one out there that thinks Hugh is a jerk.,1377129600,,168,3.8
3856874,3,B0026RLMC0,"The producer is also the narrator. He is totally redundant repeating all these disasters that could but never happen. The computer graphics are amateurism and the phoney screams of driver, supposedly plunging off cliffs or sinking into the depths of a frozen sea are quite annoying.",1376956800,,282,5.1521739130434785
3856875,5,B0026RLMC0,"Just amazing to etch these episodes. Looking forward for the latest episodes to watch. Kind of driving expertise they show, unbelievable. I can't even think of driving in these tough driving n weather conditions. Hats off.",1376179200,,222,5.194444444444445
3856876,4,B0026RLMC0,I like shows with real people doing real jobs. It's a pretty good show. I will be watching more of these if they put them on prime.,1376179200,,131,3.888888888888889
3856877,5,B0026RLMC0,Good show. Gives you an overview of what it's like to do this kind of work. Also you get to see a lot of different terrain/country.,1374624000,,131,4.076923076923077
3856878,4,B0026RLMC0,Interesting people doing very difficult work in tough weather.....no wonder they get paid well for the risk of being frozen to death!,1374624000,,133,5.090909090909091
3856879,3,B0026RLMC0,If you have a while to kill and like to listen to kids fight you will like this show.  The country side is beutiful and some of the contint is great but the fighting goes on to long,1374451200,,181,3.763157894736842
3856880,3,B0026RLMC0,Keeps you on the edge of your seat at times!  Interesting watching the personalities and egos of the truckers interacting!  And it's great seeing a female trucker finally!,1363737600,,171,5.071428571428571
3856881,4,B0026RLMC0,Enjoy the suspense of not knowing what is around the next curve.  Tricks for dealing with the extreme cold are interesting.,1363219200,,123,4.857142857142857
3856882,5,B0026RLMC0,My son loves all of the ice road truckers movies. he wants all of them for his collection!! Can't wait!,1361318400,,103,4.2
3856883,5,B0026RLMC0,"Watching these brave truckers makes me appreciate how  we would not be where we are if it wasn't for truckers! All our goods come by truck, and for the people of Alaska, it is doubly important. So, i love to watch these truckers and thier perils they have to face with one of my eyes open!",1360454400,,289,4.160714285714286
3856884,4,B0026RLMC0,"Ice road truckers is a good series and certainly makes people who have never driven a tractor trailer realize that its not as easy as it looks. The show follows likeable people who you cannot help but root for (well at least most of them). However it the does have one flaw as a show, it can be a little redundant repetitive. Im sure that is only because we are the viewers and because we're safe and warm at home and not climbing a four thousand foot ice covered pass in a 40 ton truck. For the most part this show is great it is real people doing real work. Its one of the only shows i know of that gives truckers the pat on the back that they have certainly earned. I grew up around truckers so one thing i notice from time to time is they show the wrong truck when talking about a driver. Such as when they are talking about Lisa on occasion they'll show a KW T800 when she drives a KW W900 that is something most viewers wouldn't notice but i figure for a complete review i should mention it.

Overall IRT is a great show that will give you hours of entertainment ESPECIALLY if your a trucker/grew up around them/ or intending to be one. This show is worth the money, 4 out of 5 stars, the only reason it is not 5 out of 5 is because it does get slightly repetitive.",1352937600,,1271,4.084
3856885,5,B0026RLMC0,"the product was amazing, there is so much detail about every driver and about how they get the ice roads ready for driving on",1350691200,,125,4.25
3856886,2,B0026RLMC0,"I am highly disappointed in the outcome of this package.  It not only DOESN'T fill my entire TV screen, but also it has fewer episodes than what they showed us on History Channel in 2009!

I was expecting to see 16 episodes available in package, and failed to see the product details further down its page on Amazon.  That was MY fault, obviously, but what really angers me the most is how small the picture is when played from my new optical drive.  Season 4 does NOT have this problem, and there are all 16 episodes in that package.  However, I've played that season so many times I thought it was then time to watch a different season.  And since Season 3 was my original favorite of the ""Ice Road Truckers"" series, I chose to go with that.  Amazon needs to improve the quality of their DVDs based on TV episodes, in my opinion!",1346630400,2,831,4.357142857142857
3856887,5,B0026RLMC0,"I watched this show on Netflix and was so hooked, I HAD to order the series online! I don't know how anyone could criticize this movie the way it's made. Lisa Kelly makes her debut on the Alaska ice roads--over 450 miles of deadly twists and turns on icy roads, and she is my personal hero with her extreme confidence in taking these risks carrying these loads in sub-zero temperatures, which is something MOST guys won't even do since they feel more intent on watching this show in their comfy lifestyle and don't seem to understand what these truckers face. You pay close attention enough, you'll get white-knuckled yourself just watching the dangers these truckers go through, especially the dangerous Atigun Pass and it's multiple avalanches. The ""Rollercoaster"" part of the road is dangerous enough for me to say, ""No way!!!"" when I think about driving that in a regular car, but here are these amazing people taking that dip every day with a new load weighing tens of thousands of pounds and do it with barely a grimace or a second thought.

Hugh ""Polar Bear"" Rowland is back in action with his Canadian style of humor taking the roads as a rookie. I tip my hat to him, saying, ""Not bad!"" when you consider he conquered the roads his own way, but unfortunately, not as the top scorer as he was in the first two seasons, which were done on HIS home turf if you consider the reason why. And the reason also because he had to spend a week training for the risks in what to expect while truckers like Jack Jesse, the Virginian who takes to heavy-hauling on the Dalton Highway like a pro, and Lisa Kelly are already on the roads battling the elements.

Alex is one of my personal favorites. I worried about his health probably as much as his family members when he went into the hospital in Season 2 and kept wondering, ""Is he going to recover and truck some more after this?"" But he makes a big comeback in reply to his fans with a big consideration for getting the job done with a smile on his face and that cool goofy laugh of his. 5 stars all the way! I hope we get 20 seasons more of these guys!",1335312000,,2101,4.412371134020619
3856888,2,B0026RLMC0,"What was made into a series, could have been done in a single one segment of 45 minutes. I found it very redundant and over dramatized. I found the first series done in India somewhat more interesting.",1328486400,,201,4.45945945945946
3856889,4,B0026RLMC0,"Ice Road truckers 3 has a new location,some new truckers,a lot of the same problems all in Blue Ray,so it looks better than ever. The new location is Alaska and it is some really tough roads to drive on,but Alex is back from his health problems from sesason 2,it's good to hear that crazy laugh of his. Hugh the Polar Bear is back too so him and Alex can continue the dash for the cash. A new trucker is Lisa who noy only a good trucker she is good looking to boot,so that should keep guys watching,Jack is a new trucker a pro on the ice roads and some other new truckers,if you like seasons 1 and 2 you will like this one too.",1310601600,,627,4.064516129032258
3856890,5,B0026RLMC0,"Season three is more about trucking, less about childish drivers and their antics when NOT in the cab (like season two). This season IRT went to Alaska's tundra, river and sea ice roads with more scenery and way more treacherous weather conditions. There are no roller coaster roads or avalanches to worry about on Canada's ice roads. I found season three to be very interesting and extremely entertaining.",1303516800,,406,4.985294117647059
3856891,5,B0026RLMC0,Excellent show. I missed much of the episodes on TV and was so excited to see it available on line.,1297036800,,99,4.0
3856892,5,B0026RLMC0,"I watched this show on the History Channel and decided that I would like to have a copy of it so I could watch it again.
The show follows several truckers who haul freight in Alaska. They mainly follow the Dalton Highway from Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The show is primarily concerned with trips taken during the winter season when the roadway freezes over. Sometimes, freight is hauled over frozen lakes and rivers, and there is danger of the trucks falling through the ice.
The worst thing about watching the show on the air is that just at a very suspenseful moment, the viewer is abruptly thrust into a commercial. Consequently, the best thing about the video disks is the absence of commercials.
At the time of this writing, there are four seasons of ""Ice Road Truckers,"" of which this is the third. Season four is currently being shown on The History Channel. If you are a fan of the show, I recommend this collection.",1276560000,12,931,4.614457831325301
3856893,5,B0026RLMC0,"I'm hooked, I'm a trucker and I watch these all the time. I have made some changes in my own driving decisions since watching those who work hard and are professional. Finding slackers and trouble makers are a dime a dozen. Its all about getting the job done, Hugh and his ol friend get it done. Its tuff work and he is a tuff worker. Know many aspects of your job and you will be a valuble asset to your employer.
Don't complain do the job, when your the best of the best then you can talk smack to others. Hugh has his act together.
Ice road truckers is a video that anyone who has a place in their heart for big rigs, big hauls and edge of your seat excitment needs to see this. Its awesome!",1271462400,4,694,4.072992700729927
3856894,5,B0026RLMC0,This is a great show that truly shows the life and adventures of these men and women.  You always here about the ice roads now this lets you strap in and see what its all about.  The hard work the fear the heart pumping adrenaline.  Truly a must have for any semi lover and driver or anyone who has ever wondered about whats up north and who lives there.,1269993600,3,354,4.101449275362318
3856895,5,B0026RLMC0,"If the first episode is any indication, Ice Road Truckers Season 3 will be the best one yet. I think what sets this one apart from seasons 1 and 2 is the Haul Road leading up to the ice road. I've been on the haul road up to Coldfoot and this brings back great memories. If you like extreme weather, trucking, incredible scenery or even just learning about Prudhoe Bay, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. Both Hugh and Alex are back once again (even though they didn't drive in the first episode). I hear season 4 is underway on the Haul Road (Dalton Highway) once again. I hope that's true because I can't wait for season 4 and I just started season 3. Enjoy!",1265328000,3,657,4.264
8353533,5,B0026RLMC0,Good show.  But.. their getting alittle silly with how dangerous these roads are. This Alaska road is too fkn dangerous. Crude oil aint as important as a persons life !!,1527033600,,169,4.633333333333334
