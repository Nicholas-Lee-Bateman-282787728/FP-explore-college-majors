8562797,5,B00B5AIB50,"The Austrian conductor Herbert Von Karajan goes from strength to strength. Look at his vast number of recordings available on Amazon, YouTube and elsewhere. His reach has never been wider. He's more accessible now than he was in his lifetime. His recordings have made him immortal - as he expected they would.

`When he said ""This is for future generations"" I realised: Good heavens, he wants to live on!' recalls one of his colleagues in this documentary.

Karajan himself says: `I believe we can have more than one life. And I'll be back, I can tell you that!'

In truth, he never went away. When he died in 1989 he just shifted into another realm. And here he is now as large as life - close-up - making his recordings. Hence the title of this documentary:- ""Karajan - The Second Life,""  where we see the maestro rehearsing, performing and working with musicians and technicians. The director Eric Schultz has unearthed a mass of interviews where Karajan explains what he was doing, as well as privately recorded telephone conversations and archive film.

A jet-setting superstar, Karajan once held, simultaneously, six of the world's most prestigious musical posts, including director of the Salzburg Festival, artistic director of the Vienna State Opera, and conductor for life of the Berlin Philharmonic. He achieved international fame through his best-selling recordings and quickly mastered 78 rpm discs, television, vinyl LPs, tapes and digital CDs. Now we can see him on DVDs and the Internet.

Karajan had a remarkable talent for extracting beautiful sounds from an orchestra. This documentary shows how he did it. The film analyses how Karajan made his recordings with explanations from those all-important, but shadowy people behind the scenes - the recording engineers with whom the conductor worked so closely.

What we have here is a master class in how to record classical music by one of the supreme masters - Karajan explaining his techniques and people who worked with him adding their comments. Karajan was a pioneer who took recording seriously. By the mid 1950s the technology had advanced sufficiently for him to achieve technical and artistic perfection

Eric Schultz says he had two aims with this documentary - to show Karajan at work in the studio and concert hall and `to revive awareness of something that risks being lost from sight: the music recording as an autonomous work of art.'

Karajan was one of the first to realise this was possible. Tape recording came in during the 1940s, vastly improving the quality of recorded sound. Soon after the Second World War EMI's Walter Legge brought Karajan over to London to conduct the Philharmonia, an orchestra he founded mainly for recordings. Long before the Beatles burst upon the music world Karajan was recording at Abbey Road and elsewhere - his career rescued by an Englishman.

As the producer Andrew Keener remarked: `In the Philharmonia, Legge created an orchestra the refinement of which Karajan had never previously encountered. Between them, they made recording a recognisable art form in itself for the first time. They shaped the aesthetics of classical recording.'

When Karajan became conductor-for-life of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1955 everything came together and he was able to achieve technical and artistic perfection. With twenty years conducting experience behind him Karajan had immense authority and he was now in charge of one of the finest - some said the finest - symphony orchestra in the world. Stereo was coming in and, for the first time in history, it was possible to record nearly the full range of sounds audible to the human ear with minimum distortion. Add to that the long playing record and Karajan's recording career took off into the stratosphere.

One of the contributors to this documentary claims Karajan `spent more time in the recording studio than anybody else - ever. An enormous number of sessions.'

The idea was to produce not only a work of art, but enable the listener to hear the music as Karajan himself heard it while conducting. If you've ever wondered what it was like to conduct one of the great orchestras of the world such as the Berlin Philharmonic, or the Vienna Philharmonic, then these recordings will tell you. You can hear the music as Karajan did. `Only in a recording, and not if you sit in the hall, do you gain an impression of the sound that the conductor heard on the podium,' he says. `Just name one concert hall where any four listeners have the same acoustic impression! In one seat it will be fine, in another absolutely dreadful. The hall manipulates the music. And when it finally finds its way into the ears of the listeners their ears will manipulate the music as well.'

Karajan found he could bring out details impossible to hear in a concert hall. `Sometimes it's so beautiful it's almost frightening,' he says.

Other conductors just performed the music and let the technicians get on with it. Not Karajan. He realised he needed a different technique from the concert hall. So he immersed himself in the whole recording process. He wanted to know where the microphones were positioned and how the sound  balanced. It was no good giving a stunning performance if it was wrecked by badly positioned mikes and clumsy levels and mixing.

And you needed to perform in a hall with the right acoustics. That's obvious now, but listen to many of the Toscanini recordings made in a notorious radio studio with no echo. However lively the performance the acoustics killed the music stone dead. And Toscanini never noticed! Nor did anybody in the radio studio. Karajan discovered the Jesus-Christus church in Berlin could enhance the sound of his orchestra. In this film we see this church where he recorded many of his legendary performances - including Wagner's Ring cycle, Impressionist music and much more. It's a beautiful red brick 1930s building - modern, but not too modern - light, airy and with a congenial atmosphere. No wonder the Berliners gave their best when working here.

Karajan wanted to produce a transparent sound where every note was precisely played and audible. He wanted a luxurious sound - nothing thin and tinny.  Sloppiness was unacceptable. 'He disentangles the textures, makes polyphony transparent in the midst of all the colour', observed one critic after listening to Karajan conducting Wagner. 'At times the effect is that of chamber music.'

Karajan objected to the term. 'I do not make chamber music,' he said. 'I produce music in which the design is clearly identifiable. The complex structure of the Wagnerian melos, with four of five themes interwoven simultaneously, can only be perceived in that way ... When we did ""The Ring"", people said it was ""chamber music"", but I would deny that. It was the full Wagner orchestra, with full sonority, but played with real subtlety and the full range of dynamic levels.'

The secret of producing a beautiful sound was obsessive rehearsals until Karajan got everything right. Early in his career, he discovered if he first mastered the discipline of a rehearsal he could later conjure up a near-perfect performance in a live concert.'I cannot teach you how to conduct,' he once told a group of student conductors. 'But I can show you how to rehearse in such a way that, when you come to the concert itself, you will barely need to conduct.'

As this film shows Karajan cared about details - barely audible nuances that when taken together produced an extraordinary sound. He insisted on a flawless performance. But perfection has its dangers. It can kill spontaneity. Karajan wanted energy and movement. 'Fill those notes with life,' he told his musicians. At his best he produced exquisite sounds - a lightness of touch, joie de vivre and sonority - what one critic called a mix of ice and fire.

The American opera singer Jessye Norman said, `Herbert von Karajan always rolled out a magic carpet for us, the singers. With him, our musical work took on another dimension.' His subtle accompaniments lifted the singers, but never drowned them out.

Some critics, such as his biographer Richard Osborne, recognised early on that Karajan was creating something extraordinary - something revolutionary. Others were indifferent, or hostile.

The music critic Martin Bookspan refused to discuss Karajan recordings in his column in ""Stereo Review"". In 1970, in response to a flood of letters from readers asking why he ignored Karajan's recordings he wrote:- `I find Karajan's work antithetical to my tastes ... I like sweep, passion, and chance-taking in my music, and respond coolly, if at all, to the taut, the controlled, and the precious ... there is a quality of rigid calculation to much of Karajan's music-making that is downright offensive to my ears.'

Damn you ears Mr Bookspan! You turned your back on the man Sir Georg Solti said `was perhaps the greatest conductor of the 20th century.' You ignored Karajan when he was producing legendary recordings - one of the great events in the history of music. You refused to listen when readers told you something astonishing was happening.

Others showed a similar myopia. Few, however, could match the visceral hatred displayed by the music critic Norman Lebrecht. When the centenary of Karajan's birth was celebrated in 2008 he exploded in ""The Independent"" newspaper. Lebrecht rained down curses on what he called `the clapped-out legacy of Karajan that impoverished classical music' ... `Karajan is dead,' he raved. `Music is much better off without him.'  And Lebrecht boasted, `On the only occasion he asked to meet me, in 1985, I decided to decline the offer of an interview, preferring to observe him at a distance...'

Poor Norman - too high and mighty to meet von Karajan! Perhaps if he had he might have learnt something. The great advantage of this film is we can watch Karajan at work close-up. We can judge for ourselves whether he was a serious musician, or playboy. Close-ups are more revealing than distant views. They show a man dedicated to music.

At the height of the Cold War, when Berlin was a divided city and under constant communist threat, Karajan kept returning to perform and record - keeping alive a great artistic tradition. He stayed in hotels instead of living in Berlin. And was he stuffing himself with champagne, caviar, truffles, rare meats and wines? No, the hotel bills reveal he kept going on apple juice and salad as he performed live and recorded.

Karajan constantly experimented. Sometimes he was less successful. But it's not a crime for a performing artist occasionally to fail. What matters are the successes and Karajan produced an astonishing amount of high quality music.

This documentary concentrates on the conductor's work in the sound studio. We see the vaults where all the original recordings from 1938 until his death in 1989 are preserved. Modern technicians can dub them off digitally and make adjustments so the sound is better than ever.

To find out more about Karajan's work in opera and on film and video (which he also pioneered) then look at Robert Dornhelm's film ""Karajan - or Beauty as I see it"" and ""Herbert Von Karajan - Maestro For The Screen"" - a film by Georg Wubbolt. And if you want to find out all about his life then there's Richard Osborne's sumptuous biography ""Herbert Von Karajan: A Life in Music"" - over 800 pages long.

Karajan was a controversial figure - a visionary and paradoxical man. The philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin claimed he was, `A genius - with a whiff of sulphur about him.'

Writing in ""The Telegraph"" during Karajan's 2008 centenary the critic Ivan Hewitt declared , `Something creepy is happening in the world of classical music.' He deplored the release of a 'tidal wave' of  Karajan CDs and DVDs. 'Karajan isn't being celebrated because he was an especially profound musician,' claimed Hewitt. 'He's being celebrated because he was enormously successful and enormously rich. No one ever nominates Karajan's recording of a work as their favourite, though his version might come in at number three or four.'

That last comment provoked Michael Henderson to remark in the same newspaper - 'Heavens above! Has he never heard either of Karajan's Rosenkavaliers, his Falstaff, his Mahler Ninth (live or studio set), his Sibelius Seventh, his 1960s Beethoven cycle, any of his Heldenlebens, or, best of all, his Meistersinger?'

Accuracy, as Henderson pointed out in his article, seldom bothered Karajan's more acerbic critics. That point was only too clear when Hewitt went on to say he was 'always repulsed by the Karajan phenomenon, and the whole culture that went with it: the shunning of creativity...'

'The shunning of creativity'?  ... Where is this critic living? A glance at this and other documentaries, as well as Richard Osborne's biography, shows how ill-informed this remark is. Karajan was involved in the most intricate details of creative music making. We can see for ourselves the maestro at work in numerous videos - rehearsing and recording. The evidence is there. It proves the critics wrong.

As for Hewitt accusing Karajan of the 'turning of music into a luxury consumer item' ... No - the conductor recorded music of the highest artistic quality with some of the greatest musicians of his time. And he made this music available to the widest audience outside the concert hall and opera house at a reasonable cost. Karajan was an autocrat who democratised music.  He was popular because he was good. And his best still sounds good. That is why his music still speaks to people today.

The violinist Krzysztof  Polonek, who appears in this documentary, admires Karajan's skill and artistry and has no doubts about his abilities: 'One word that always occurs to me in connection with him is ""serious"". He was always serious. I don't mean deadly serious, but always totally focussed on the matter in hand.'

Exactly - Karajan was a serious musician. It is stupid for critics to claim otherwise when evidence that refutes what they're saying is easy to find. Critics may disparage or ignore Karajan, but modern technology has enabled him to circumvent them. Karajan can now reach a global audience on the Internet. If you type his name into Google you'll find over 750,000 entries. You can watch him conducting on YouTube. Thousands of Karajan's recordings are available on CD, video and websites. And new discoveries are appearing all the time as long-forgotten recordings tumble out of the archives. Millions of people are listening to his music. Perhaps music lovers and the public know better than those who carp.

People seldom put up statues to critics. They are of little importance. But you can find a statue of Karajan in Salzburg. His real monuments, though, are his recordings, the best of which sound as fresh and vibrant as the day they were made. In 2008 Norman Lebrecht claimed 'Karajan was a moral and creative nullity. His myth does not survive the test of time.'

But it has! He's more popular than ever. Karajan lives on. He is immortal. Cry your eyes out Norman Lebrecht. You, too, Ivan Hewitt. Karajan has triumphed again.",1412985600,21,15143,4.969553183076314

8562800,5,B00B5AIB50,"I have seen a number of documentaries on Karajan....but this one held my interest the most.  It shows him fully engaged in an impossible quest to attain his artistic vision in the recording studio.  He was a complex and demanding taskmaster, not especially sensitive in the area of interpersonal relations (Aspergers?), a deficit which he admits and ultimately a tragic figure despite his many  achievements.  The interview with Karajan filmed not long before his death comes as quite a shock, his aged drained appearance quite different than a few years earlier and his rather dismissive opinion of his recorded legacy with his Berlin orchestra not really something I expected.  When I saw Karajan conduct Heldenleben on one of his last North American tours, he was barely able to make it to the podium where he sat as he conducted.  On the final chord he expanded his arms straight out to the side and the Berlin Philharmonic produced a sound that I had never heard before in the concert hall.  It was not of this world. It felt as though he would simply levitate and soar upwards.  I'm a Furtwangler man so this transforming experience was not something I really expected, given the reputation that Karajan had in many circles of being technically accomplished but too self-involved and superficial.  Thus began my serious reconsideration of Karajan's place in the pantheon of great recreative artists.  This documentary contributes a great deal to this discussion and will be of interest to those who are fascinated by this larger than life conductor.",1376352000,30,1555,4.992248062015504
8562801,5,B00B5AIB50,"I have probably watched every Karajan documentary that's been released on VHS and DVD over the last 25 years (""Karajan in Salzburg"", ""Karajan, or Beauty as I see it"", ""Karajan: Maestro for the Screen"", etc.)  This is one of the best, due almost entirely to the loads of rare footage I'd never seen before.  The focus is on Karajan as a recording artist in the last 20 years of his career.  So there are the requisite interviews with Anne-Sophie Mutter, Brigitte Fassbaender, and others.  No terribly fresh or arresting points are made, but the rehearsal sequences and snippets from live performances and the footage of Karajan in the recording control room are truly invaluable.  You get to see a side of him that is all too rarely displayed in the more glamorized and carefully staged stock footage.  The snippets of him coaching Thomas Stewart as the Wanderer in Siegfried, or yukking it up in the control room with Michael Glotz and the sound engineers, or those from the live performance of Mahler's 5th (complete with his post-performance exit to the wings were he signs autographs for fans in between bows), for example, are fascinating to watch.  Much attention is given to Karajan's relationships with his producers and sound engineers and his attempts to make his recordings reflect the orchestral sound he heard at the podium, rather than as one might hear it as an audience member sitting in the concert hall.  Again, for admirers of Karajan and his recorded legacy (even if you have mixed feelings about them, as I often do) this is incredibly engrossing documentary.",1373414400,25,1579,4.887640449438202
