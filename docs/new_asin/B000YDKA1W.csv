3027108,5,B000YDKA1W,"My son is two and has had these videos for about 6 months.  He can identify every letter in the alphabet and is counting almost to twenty now!  I work with him a lot, but I would say these DVD's are a great help because his favorite Sesame Street characters make it fun and present the info differently than I do.  Both of them are an essential part of our Sesame Street collection.",1243296000,19,382,4.205479452054795
3027109,5,B000YDKA1W,"After watching ""123 Count with Me"" a few times my 22 mo. old son was counting to ten!!  I can't tell you how long I tried, but this video made it click!  The ABC one is good too and he has definitely learned to identify letters from this video.  Both videos are educational and very fun!!",1241308800,2,288,4.107142857142857
3027110,5,B000YDKA1W,"This is my first time giving a review of anything and I am happy to do so!  The Seseme Street 123 Count with Me/Learning about letters has been the single most important video I have bought for my son.  I bought this and two other Seseme Street learning videos and I have witnessed my son, who is 2 years and 2 months old, recite the alaphebet & yesterday he acutally counted to 11 (with no help from me), while he was in the bathtub!  I am blown away!  My son loves Elmo and all the characters in the DVD.  I have told everyone who will listen about our amazing success!

3027111,5,B000YDKA1W,Love these 2 videos.  My son is obsessed with letters and numbers and these are great.  I can even watch them without going nuts.  We love Sesame street for their great programming.  These are a good investment.,1238630400,2,211,4.621621621621622
3027112,5,B000YDKA1W,"My son is learning counting, the alphabet, and the English language so quickly from the exposure to Sesame Street.  This DVD combo is a big hit with him.",1237939200,2,153,4.464285714285714
3027113,5,B000YDKA1W,"My grandson LOVES this dvd(I started with the Letters), the episodes of which his mother had also enjoyed many years ago.  The repetition and lively muppets are holding his attention at four months.  He bounces up and down during the parts he likes and cries when the dvd is over.",1234915200,15,280,4.58
3027114,4,B000YDKA1W,"My kids (3 and 1 and a half) love Sesame Street's Count on Me 123 video. They were a little younger when I first bought it and while the storyline (Ernie finds a 'Furry Arms' room key on the street, returns it to the hotel & starts teaching everyone how to count) went over their heads at first, the catchy tunes, skits & scenes (mainly from the early Sesame Street episodes) soon caught their attention. There's a cohesive plot & everything links well.

Now my 3-year-old knows most of the words and even my one-and-a-half can say some numbers - it's a great video, fun to watch even for adults, and I highly recommend it.

Learning about Letters is more of a cut-and-paste of other Sesame Street skits & scenes - not that this isn't good, just that it's standard fare. I like that they are taken from the earlier Sesame Street episodes as I prefer the quality then. And my one-and-a-half year old loves the ""C is for Cookie"" song that I remember from back then!",1210464000,41,963,4.435028248587571

I just have 1 problem with 1 of the DVD's. the learning about letters with Cookie monster, is the same as another DVD I have called learning about letters with Big Bird. so the DVD with Cookie monster isn't really Cookie monster teaching about letters. was disappointed in that 1. otherwise, I do like the Sesame Street DVD's. my grandson really gets into them",1451433600,,378,4.656716417910448

However, these are two very good videos and i look forward to my infant enjoying them and learning along with sesame street.  My older children did not have sesame street, and i'm pretty sure tv time with Caillou or any of todays other shows is a brain drain as opposed to counting and phonetics songs.

It is FUN not just for the children, but for the parents, grandparents and daycare providers that you will find yourself singing, ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, that's how the numbers go....."" as I do but my husband does as well!

3027315,4,B000YDKA1W,"Update to my last review...it wouldnt be fair if i didn't say that my toddler after a couple months really really LOVED 123 count with me. i guess he was too young for it earlier....because of this dvd he counts easily. the only complaint is that he sometimes tries to act like the crabby rabbit benny...in fact that seems to be his favorite character, so he shouts and screams at the television along with Benny....not good reinforcement of good behavior

I was really excited to receive these dvds in the mail, however i have to say that i was disappointed. The learning about letters dvd is particularly BORING! The 123 Count with me is ok, a bit too much talking to keep my 14 month old's attention. We own other sesame street dvds...the kids favorite song collection and he absolutely loves them. Unfortunately I would not recommend this to anyone!",1315180800,,853,4.6866666666666665

There is no comparison.

I like Sesame Street and wanted my kids to be able to watch some of the stuff that I grew up watching, but for at least my sons, Seasame Street isn't an option.

For numbers, I haven't gotten any of the Leapfrog dvd's because the reviews are mixed on them. But I can say my kids did NOT like this Sesame Street #'s dvd either.",1309651200,31,615,5.898876404494382
3027327,5,B000YDKA1W,"This DVD set is awesome. We have had it since February, my son turned 2 in April and he can count to 10 on his own and identify most letters (we also do other learning activities besides this DVD, but the songs help him to keep track I think, and we often sing them in the car).

To those who gave a negative review about the bunny on the 123 count with me...they don't have a sense of humor! By the end of the DVD Vinny is singing along with everyone else, and if you watch the whole DVD it teaches kids to not let negative attitudes get them down - Ernie keeps on going despite what Vinny says/does.

Great DVD to start your toddler/preschool kid on the ABCs and 123s. Plus if you watched Sesame Street as a kid in the 70s/80s, there are lots of clips you will probably remember!",1306454400,,781,4.131578947368421
3027328,5,B000YDKA1W,This video gives me flashbacks to my childhood. My one year old son always stops to watch the puppets when they sing and consequently loves it when I count or say the alphabet in song form. It's a way better option than some of the more annoying (albeit educational) videos out for kids.,1304899200,,287,4.433962264150943
3027329,4,B000YDKA1W,My son has watched this a couple of times already and has already started counting to 3. I  love this more than the newer versions of Sesame Street. My son also loves it too. He absolutely adores Cookie Monster.,1302825600,,211,4.410256410256411
3027330,5,B000YDKA1W,"He is absolutely enjoying this.  I bought this along with some of the leap frog series, and I must say, it is a very good investment.",1301875200,,133,4.115384615384615
3027331,5,B000YDKA1W,The 123 DVD taught my 2 yr-old daughter to be a strong 1-10 counter with strong NUMBER SENSE.  The 123 makes understanding counting concrete.  The Letters DVD taught my two year old all of her letter names.  That's a lot to gain from a DVD set.  Now we're on to Leapfrog for more advanced concepts.,1301529600,,298,4.363636363636363
3027332,1,B000YDKA1W,"My 2 boys, 2 and 3.5 years old didn't like these at all. They took stuff from the late 70's / early 80's for these dvd's. My 2 year old loves basically every dvd that has something to do with numbers or letters... but he never paid attention to these. So we gave these away after a couple weeks.",1300492800,24,295,4.016949152542373
3027333,5,B000YDKA1W,"I love these DVD's for my 2 year old. I was look ing for entertaining short videos for learning the alphabet & numbers. The videos are only about 30 minutes long, just enough to keep my toddler interested! They have all the scenes and characters us parents grew up with, and a mix of cartoons in between. I think these will definately help my 2 year old get a jump on learning the ABC's & 123'S!!",1299542400,,396,4.223684210526316
3027334,4,B000YDKA1W,"I purchased the 123 Count with Me/Learning About Letters DVD combo for my 22 month old son and after watching it twice a day for one month, he began reading our neighbor's license plates! I feel that the Learning About Letters DVD has benefitted our son the most. This video shows each letter of the alphabet for a few seconds and gives multiple examples of their usage, such as: ""Apple starts with 'A' and airplane starts with 'A'."" Parker loves to watch Ernie in the 123 Count with Me video, but he is not as confident in his numeral recognition skills as he is in his letter recognition. It would be my assumption(which very well could be inaccurate) that this is because there is more music and conversation and less emphasis on the numbers themselves. Both DVDs have great entertainment value for toddlers and adults, but Learning about Letters is, in my opinion, the better of the two.",1289347200,8,891,4.6455696202531644

3027353,3,B000YDKA1W,"I got this dvd hoping for Sesame Street magic. While Learning About Letters was great, I was very disappointed in 1-2-3 Count With Me. It was just...blah. The plot was thin and confusing, the counting sequences were confusing, it just didn't do anything for children just learning to count. It had a few classic moments, but overall was not worth buying. I won't show it to my child. I recommend buying Learning About Letters separately.",1255478400,7,437,4.84

The first was lost and my 2 1/2 year old kept asking for it (123 Count with Me).  In the first couple of weeks, my 2 yr old was signing one of the songs where he was counting to 20.  The music sticks with you.  We have not watched Learning About Letters as much so I don't have much to say about it.  123 Count with Me is played several times a day and when it is not playing, my son is walking around the house singing the songs.  I would recommend this product as a learning tool as well as for any child that enjoys music.",1247097600,5,676,3.8550724637681157

3261605,5,B000YDKA1W,"My son is two and has had these videos for about 6 months.  He can identify every letter in the alphabet and is counting almost to twenty now!  I work with him a lot, but I would say these DVD's are a great help because his favorite Sesame Street characters make it fun and present the info differently than I do.  Both of them are an essential part of our Sesame Street collection.",1243296000,19,382,4.205479452054795

The Seseme Street 123 Count with Me/Learning about letters has been the single most important video I have bought for my son.  I bought this and two other Seseme Street learning videos and I have witnessed my son, who is 2 years and 2 months old, recite the alaphebet & yesterday he acutally counted to 11 (with no help from me), while he was in the bathtub!  I am blown away!  My son loves Elmo and all the characters in the DVD.  I have told everyone who will listen about our amazing success!

3261611,4,B000YDKA1W,"My kids (3 and 1 and a half) love Sesame Street's Count on Me 123 video. They were a little younger when I first bought it and while the storyline (Ernie finds a 'Furry Arms' room key on the street, returns it to the hotel & starts teaching everyone how to count) went over their heads at first, the catchy tunes, skits & scenes (mainly from the early Sesame Street episodes) soon caught their attention. There's a cohesive plot & everything links well.

Now my 3-year-old knows most of the words and even my one-and-a-half can say some numbers - it's a great video, fun to watch even for adults, and I highly recommend it.

Learning about Letters is more of a cut-and-paste of other Sesame Street skits & scenes - not that this isn't good, just that it's standard fare. I like that they are taken from the earlier Sesame Street episodes as I prefer the quality then. And my one-and-a-half year old loves the ""C is for Cookie"" song that I remember from back then!",1210464000,41,963,4.435028248587571

It is FUN not just for the children, but for the parents, grandparents and daycare providers that you will find yourself singing, ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, that's how the numbers go....."" as I do but my husband does as well!  I continue to purchase this DVD as gifts for all I know with toddlers.  I recommend this DVD to EVERYONE with children!",1355875200,,358,4.235294117647059

3261812,4,B000YDKA1W,"Update to my last review...it wouldnt be fair if i didn't say that my toddler after a couple months really really LOVED 123 count with me. i guess he was too young for it earlier....because of this dvd he counts easily. the only complaint is that he sometimes tries to act like the crabby rabbit benny...in fact that seems to be his favorite character, so he shouts and screams at the television along with Benny....not good reinforcement of good behavior

I was really excited to receive these dvds in the mail, however i have to say that i was disappointed. The learning about letters dvd is particularly BORING! The 123 Count with me is ok, a bit too much talking to keep my 14 month old's attention. We own other sesame street dvds...the kids favorite song collection and he absolutely loves them. Unfortunately I would not recommend this to anyone!",1315180800,,853,4.6866666666666665

There is no comparison.

I like Sesame Street and wanted my kids to be able to watch some of the stuff that I grew up watching, but for at least my sons, Seasame Street isn't an option.

For numbers, I haven't gotten any of the Leapfrog dvd's because the reviews are mixed on them. But I can say my kids did NOT like this Sesame Street #'s dvd either.",1309651200,31,615,5.898876404494382
3261824,5,B000YDKA1W,"This DVD set is awesome. We have had it since February, my son turned 2 in April and he can count to 10 on his own and identify most letters (we also do other learning activities besides this DVD, but the songs help him to keep track I think, and we often sing them in the car).

To those who gave a negative review about the bunny on the 123 count with me...they don't have a sense of humor! By the end of the DVD Vinny is singing along with everyone else, and if you watch the whole DVD it teaches kids to not let negative attitudes get them down - Ernie keeps on going despite what Vinny says/does.

Great DVD to start your toddler/preschool kid on the ABCs and 123s. Plus if you watched Sesame Street as a kid in the 70s/80s, there are lots of clips you will probably remember!",1306454400,,781,4.131578947368421
3261825,5,B000YDKA1W,This video gives me flashbacks to my childhood. My one year old son always stops to watch the puppets when they sing and consequently loves it when I count or say the alphabet in song form. It's a way better option than some of the more annoying (albeit educational) videos out for kids.,1304899200,,287,4.433962264150943
3261826,4,B000YDKA1W,My son has watched this a couple of times already and has already started counting to 3. I  love this more than the newer versions of Sesame Street. My son also loves it too. He absolutely adores Cookie Monster.,1302825600,,211,4.410256410256411

3261828,5,B000YDKA1W,The 123 DVD taught my 2 yr-old daughter to be a strong 1-10 counter with strong NUMBER SENSE.  The 123 makes understanding counting concrete.  The Letters DVD taught my two year old all of her letter names.  That's a lot to gain from a DVD set.  Now we're on to Leapfrog for more advanced concepts.,1301529600,,298,4.363636363636363

The videos are only about 30 minutes long, just enough to keep my toddler interested! They have all the scenes and characters us parents grew up with, and a mix of cartoons in between. I think these will definately help my 2 year old get a jump on learning the ABC's & 123'S!!",1299542400,,396,4.223684210526316
3261831,4,B000YDKA1W,"I purchased the 123 Count with Me/Learning About Letters DVD combo for my 22 month old son and after watching it twice a day for one month, he began reading our neighbor's license plates! I feel that the Learning About Letters DVD has benefitted our son the most. This video shows each letter of the alphabet for a few seconds and gives multiple examples of their usage, such as: ""Apple starts with 'A' and airplane starts with 'A'."" Parker loves to watch Ernie in the 123 Count with Me video, but he is not as confident in his numeral recognition skills as he is in his letter recognition. It would be my assumption(which very well could be inaccurate) that this is because there is more music and conversation and less emphasis on the numbers themselves. Both DVDs have great entertainment value for toddlers and adults, but Learning about Letters is, in my opinion, the better of the two.",1289347200,8,891,4.6455696202531644

The plot was thin and confusing, the counting sequences were confusing, it just didn't do anything for children just learning to count. It had a few classic moments, but overall was not worth buying.

The music sticks with you.  We have not watched Learning About Letters as much so I don't have much to say about it.  123 Count with Me is played several times a day and when it is not playing, my son is walking around the house singing the songs.
