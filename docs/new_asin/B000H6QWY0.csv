8137081,5,B000H6QWY0,"Actually thought I had rented a documentary on Roswell.  Didn't realize Spielberg had produced/directed a miniseries in 2002.  The series chronicles 50 yrs. of alien abductions from 3 American families.  It begins with the infamous Roswell crash.  The series was fantastic.  The acting was excellent.  You actually felt you were living during the time period.  Almost wishing you were during the first 20 yrs.  It had the ""Spielberg magic"" touch.  All of the actors were great.  But, I felt compelled to state the depth of Hawkes' acting abilities.  At times, I was almost mesmerized by his blue eyes and the realistic ability he brought to his character. The touch was so realistic, I wondered just how true many of the events could have been, esp. the ""cover-up"" by the gov't. after Roswell. The ideas/explanations with a litle girl (Dakato Faning) narrating, lead me to see how easily ""conspiracies"" were believed by so many people. All-in-all a great story to enjoy.",1333756800,2,970,5.0
