2730280,2,B000MFXTY2,Slow-paced story about the daily lives of policemen in Paris. Not much action or drama-mostly boring.,1192147200,,101,5.375
2730281,4,B000MFXTY2,"(3 1/2) While watching `Le Petit Lieutenant' I had to keep asking myself, `Why is this movie anything better than a  US crime series?'  Often watching foreign movies, I have to back up and say, 'How can I judge this movie?'  After all, there is a temptation to give a French movie an unfair advantage or to demote its value based on American standard or yardstick.  Either way is an insult to everyone.  Comparing, `Le Petit Lieutenant' to `Law and Order,' a fine American crime series, yielded some results.  While the developments and investigations in the movie remind one of any crime series, some elements definitely put this movie ahead.  The authenticity of the characters seems even more vivid and real.  Especially the dialogue reveals a good deal about the nature of France's police force and more than a self-examination of French culture.

The movie begins with the graduation of the titled character, Antoine Deroue're (Jalil Lespert) from the police academy.  He's already an elite member of the force, a lieutenant, but still a new fish in the pond.  He's left his school teacher wife behind in Le Havre to pursue his career in Paris.  His new supervisor, Caroline Vaudieu (Nathalle Baye), is a sort of ""super cop"" from a ""family of super cops"".  Newly reinstated, she is greeted enthusiastically as she returns after two years of complications only hinted at as a recovering alcoholic.  His new division comes across with great authenticity.  His initiation includes the escapades of his colleagues and their conversations are full of sentiments about their work, specifically, and about France in general.  Included are unvarnished prejudices of foreigners; something that sets up the main plot well.  In one conversation, one officer after a few beers offers eloquently:  ""Paris now sucks.""  In the discourse they decide the turning point was 1995.  One of the brightest lights of the force is a colleague of Moroccan decent who shares that it took him years before he was accepted as one of group.  During the engaging prologue, we see the run-of-the-mill development of Antoine develop until early on when he runs into a rare case of real import:  A Polish man, seemingly homeless, is dragged up from the Seine River and revealed to have been cruelly murdered.

`Le Petit Lieutenant' works well because the dialogue is excellent, the action feels real, and the complications and setbacks develop naturally.  In one of the scenes, I was truly moved by the unexpected.  A development took a while for the characters to get over as well as for me as I watched.  There is also effective humor.  In one scene, Antoine and his supervisor are smoking marijuana in a park.  A nightfly comes by to mooch a drag from their joint.  Parting, he warns them, ""Watch out.  This place is crawling with cops.""

In the end, that's how 'Le Petit Lieutenant' is distinctive.  The details show some of the futility of a young, dedicated man in emotional times with absorbing characters and the repercussions of their lives.",1184025600,8,3022,4.922772277227723
2730282,2,B000MFXTY2,"This thriller moves very, very slow and is constantly sidetracked by meaningless subplots. What is the point ? Where is the story ? Where were the editors ?",1181952000,,156,4.607142857142857
2730283,5,B000MFXTY2,"Jane Tennyson (Helen Mirren in the PBS series, ""Prime Suspect"") and Caroline Vaudieu (a thoughtful, sad, tragic Nathalie Baye in this film): the comparisons are inevitable. Both are Chief Inspectors in charge of an all man team of detectives, both have problematic personal lives and both suffer from alcoholism.
But whereas Tennyson is like a feral cat, ready to pounce, full of rage, Vaudieu, though equally as competent as Tennyson, is laid-back, thoughtful and able to lead a group of hardened, seen-it-all detectives with her keen sense of propriety, her innate humanity and well-honed ability of always doing the right thing professionally. Vaudieu leads by example; she never falters. On the surface Baye's Vaudieu is in control but beneath that faade she is psychically falling apart: the sobriety she so desperately fought for is weakened every minute of every day by loneliness and thoughts of her  deceased son.
On the day that she returns to work after a leave, a new recruit, the ""petit lieutenant,"" Antoine Derouere (a naive and personable Jalil Lespert of Laurent Cantet's ""Human Resources"") arrives having just finished at the police academy. He is assigned to be part of Vaudieu's group.
In most films of this ilk, Vaudieu would eventually and naturally fall into bed with Derouere (his wife decides not to come with him to Paris from Normandy, so he is alone). But not so here: their relationship is refreshingly professional yet they grow to like and respect each other.
Director/Writer Xavier Beauvois directs with in an extremely understated manner: many scenes seem improvised and many of the actors are so natural that they seem like non-professionals. But Beauvois is after something else here than we usually find in a policier particularly if you compare ""Le Petit Lieutenant"" to the recent ""Miami Vice"" or even Michael Mann's ""Heat."" Beauvois's film is natural, organic, and almost documentary-like: the good guys are as flawed as the bad. The line between good and bad, love and hate is blurred, smudged as it is in Life.
In his quest for authenticity, Beauvois may give us too much detail: the checking and re-checking of facts and case leads, the repeated stake-outs, the interrogation of the same witnesses over and over. But this is a small gripe for what Beauvois has accomplished here is to raise the bar on police dramas. There are no exploding cars, hardly any car chases. The drama in ""Le Petit Lieutenant"" is the drama derived from lives well observed, of lives perpetually in danger and on the edge and the thoughtful and distinctive manner in which Beauvois cohesively manipulates these factors.",1178064000,8,2635,5.057471264367816
2730284,5,B000MFXTY2,"Director Xavier Beauvois, with the intelligent and sensitive script he co-wrote with Cdric Anger, Guillaume Braud and Jean-Eric Troubat, allows us, the viewers, to look inside the minds and lives of those people who commit to police work in a manner that pays homage to a maligned group and reinstates our visceral support to the spectrum of on the edge terror mixed with spaces of ennui that these people endure.  LA PETIT LIEUTENANT is not a crime film: it is a deeply touching inside view of the men and women who protect us.

Opening with well-staged Le Havre Police Academy graduation images Beauvois focuses on newly graduated Antoine Deroure (Jalil Lespert) as he says goodbye to his family and his wife Julie (Brangre Allaux), a school teacher who pleads with Antoine not to leave Le Havre for Paris, the destination Antoine seeks to prove his desire for an active detective career. The kind but inexperienced Antoine takes up residence in Paris and is assigned to a homicide unit with equally inexperienced young men who learn the ropes of owning a gun, the embarrassment of performance problems  at the shooting range, the awkward first 'arrests' and interrogations, and the endless hours of sitting at a desk waiting for activity.  Newly assigned as the head of Antoine's unit is Commandant Caroline Vaudieu (the extraordinary actress Nathalie Baye) who has just come off a two year sabbatical to recover from alcoholism and the associated death of her son from meningitis. The manner in which these people bond is quiet and sensitive and when finally a case comes to their attention - a man found dead in the canal - the force joins begins what they all need to do: the killer must be found.

Clues are explored, people are traced, and Antoine and Vandieu form a particularly close bond, Antoine reminding Vandieu of the son she has lost and Vandieu providing the model for his career.  Tension mounts as the criminals are pursued, coincidences occur and a tragedy cracks the bond of the group, affecting each member of the small force immeasurably. It is this very human happening and its effects that wind the movie down to moments of painful acceptance of the life of police people.

The entire cast is first rate and provides ensemble acting that is among the finest on screen.  But the portrayal by Nathalie Baye is so multifaceted, embracing the inner trauma of personal losses not only of those she loves but also of her own sense of dignity as she faithfully attends AA meetings, that her performance is triumphant.  Jalil Lespert also captures the fine line between innocence and experience that makes his portrait of a new detective not only completely credible but also one that leaves a mark on the heart. The direction and the cinematography by Caroline Champetier keep the film nearly monochromatic, the only color that is left to shock us for a brief moment is the red blood at moments of tension.  And the lack of a musical score keeps the tone of the humanity of the film intact, never reducing it to a bombastic Hollywood chase and kill film.  This is a little jewel of a film that deserves a very wide audience.  Highly Recommended.  In French, Polish, and Russian with English subtitles.

2730285,5,B000MFXTY2,"This film, the sort of work Graham Greene without condescension called ""an entertainment,"" is a fine achievement within the confines of its modern Parisian police story limits, confines it is intelligent enough not to transgress. However, it does happily push against these confines to the fullest allowable extent, becoming as a result not just a thrilling melodrama, but also a surprisingly affecting one.

At the outset, it spends a fairly liesurely time telling us about the home life of a new cop (Jalil Lespert) eager to make his mark and a veteran of the force who takes him under her wing, a recovering alcoholic and grieving mother (Natalie Baye) anxious to return to police work where she has in the past found some meaning in her otherwise troubled life. Both Lespert and Baye turn in wonderful performances, and they are ably abetted by a supporting cast which has not a single weak link. Further, when things go wrong for these central characters in the latter portion of the film, the liesurely setup has a great payoff; we care about their misfortunes to a greater extent than we would those of merely stereotypical police drama characters. All in all, this is a finely crafted melodrama without pretensions, and wholly enjoyable as just such.",1176249600,26,1258,4.933962264150943

2730287,5,B000MFXTY2,"Writer/Director Xavier Beauvois's 'Le Petit Lieutenant' was shamefully under-appreciated during its recent Stateside run.  How under-appreciated?  How does a $148,000 US take grab you?  Ugh.  It was never distributed more widely than three theaters. Double ugh.  I call it shameful because this is an outstandingly well-made film.  Good enough to garner Csar nominations (those are France's Oscar-equivalents) for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay.  French treasure Nathalie Baye walked away with Best Actress award. She locked it up with a climatic scene in which she walks alone, speechless, for over a minute.  Beauvois's camera catches the most amazingly subtle stuff in her face.  And, no jokes here about the irrelevance of French cinema to most mainstream American audiences.  This police procedural is a great film regardless of origin.  The title and first 40 minutes of the film are a bit of head fake - you think it's about the Lieutenant.  It's not.  It's about Baye's character.  That's all I'm going to say without giving anything away.  Do yourself a favor and rent this DVD to make up for missing it in the theaters.",1169164800,3,1180,5.169312169312169

8168471,3,B000MFXTY2,"Trailing a slew of awards and superlatives, French flic flick Le Petit Lieutenant is a film of two halves, the first half following a recently gradated young plain clothes cop through the traditional rites of passage - dealing with drunks, his first autopsy, trying to persuade his wife to give up her job and move to Paris with him, getting drunk with the boys, making that stupid mistake that threatens careers - the second half following Nathalie Baye's returning detective as the pressure makes her relapse back into drinking, the two linked by the pursuit of a pair of Russian muggers with a penchant for leaving their dead or dying victims in the canal. The case is followed in unsensational police procedural fashion, the few acts of violence and the one chase sequence underplayed effectively. These cops follow the rules, act and talk like real cops rather than movie cops and the mistakes they make are believable ones rather than movie ones. No-one takes the law into their own hands or goes rogue and the film unfolds in a naturalistic, genuine documentary approach, which means no excessive shakeycam or unnaturally processed orange and teal color palette.

What definitely doesn't feel real but seems common in a certain sort of policier is the absurd preponderance of movie posters dotted around the walls - Once Upon a Time in America, Saving Private Ryan, Podium, Taxi Driver, Un Flic, Seven, Reservoir Dogs, When We Were Kings and even a still from the Sicilian Clan make it look more a film distribution company's offices than a police station at times. Whether it's because of that unfortunate tendency to remind you of movies rather than the real life it strives for elsewhere or perhaps because at others it's almost a little too observational rather than drawing you in, it never quite packs the emotional punch you feel it aspires to when the inevitable error of judgement has disastrous consequences, though that's no fault of the excellent performances from Baye, revealing much by seeming to do little, a likeable Jalil Lespert and Roschdy Zem. Only the extended final shot is problematic, shifting from the character's confusion and discomfort to a couple of moments when it appears that they're consciously looking at the camera rather than, as presumably intended, the audience. As a result it's a good, engrossing movie that never makes the leap to a great one because it never quite makes up its mind whether it wants the audience to be unaware that it's just a movie or directly reminded of the fact.

The transfer is acceptable but not outstanding with the only extras a trailer and a photo gallery.",1351555200,,2633,4.914606741573034

8168475,2,B000MFXTY2,"One of the greatest storytelling tricks is to take normal, ordinary people and thrust them into extraordinary circumstances, and see what they do. This film attempts that lovely device. I read all these glowing reviews, and jumped in. Sounds likr the kind of film I'd enjoy. But I didn't. Thankfully, I rented rather than purchased this film. Because, though what everyone says about its not following convention and avoiding cliches and its gritty slice of life are all true, it still isn't good cinema. When you take out all the stereotypes and traditional plot devices and cardboard characters these films so often have, you have to replace them with something. And they didn't. This is one slow film.

I know what they were trying to do. I just didn't really care. I liked the characters. I thought the development skilled. It is beautifully filmed, well acted, and sensitively directed. There is just not much there. We are left to intuit and interpret and wonder. Too many long shots with nothing going on.

The director chose to film the most part of LE PETIT LIEUTENANT in a documentary and neutral style, in order to underscore the secret motivations of the two main characters of the film: the naivety, the selfishness and the vanity of the young lieutenant, blinded by the image of the police forces he forged himself, and the inner drama of Nathalie Baye who doesn't manage to overcome her son's death.

AO Scott in his NYT review of this film likens it to HBO's 'The Wire' in its truth and detail of the life of a young lieutenant in the Parisian plain clothes detective unit. In this film the police eat, drink, arrest the perps, follow leads and look for the big case that will make them famous.

Le Petite Lieutenant, Antoine, played by Jalil Lespert,  is from a small town, and after he graduates from the academy he wants to work in the big time, Paris. He is assigned to the detective plain clothes detail. At about the same time, Caroline Vaudieu, played by Nathalie Bayes,returns to work after 'drying out and becoming sober'. She returns as the head of the criminal unit. She is welcomed back by the team and as the film unfolds we learn more about her and her life. What we do learn right away is that she is a tough,intelligent boss and she takes the new Lieutenant under her wing.  One of their first cases is a dead body that washes up on the shore. This seems like a run-of-the-mill case until something unfolds that is so shocking that every one's life is changed. This is a film that deals with life and death, and it gives us a real sense of what it is like to work with this Paris detective group.

We get to know all of the people who become Antoine's friends. The members of this detective unit, the wife he has left behind because she did not want to move to the new city, the families of the detectives and how they run their lives. We eat dinner with them and follow their conversations. We meet Antoine's new landlady who lets out rooms to the single police. We learn how the unit works, the drunk tank, how to run a case and how each member of the unit thinks.

""Nominated for six Csars, including best picture and deservedly winning best actress for the great veteran Nathalie Baye, ""Le Petit ""Lieutenant"" is successful on two parallel levels. But, always lurking behind the tedium is the sense of impending danger, the idea that it's in the nature of police work that things could explode at any moment. With its exceptional restraint and psychological complexity paying full dividends, ""Le Petit Lieutenant"" makes that contrast and its consequences unforgettable. "" Kenneth Turan

This is a film that deals with life and death, and it gives us a real sense of what it is like to work with this Paris detective group.  I find it a stimulating but laid back look at crime and the consequences.

8168478,5,B000MFXTY2,"I find that sometimes watching a police movie is an excellent way to get acquainted with a local culture, after all 'CSI:Miami' is almost a documentary and after the 'Wire' I swore that I will not set my foot within 100 miles of Baltimore.

'Le Petit Lieutenant' illustrates the simple fact: apparently French  really are different. For example, it is socially acceptable for a Chief Inspector to steal a sac of marijuana from Narcotics division, roll a reefer and share it with a subordinate after work. It is also acceptable to share the said reefer with a passerby. It goes without saying that it is acceptable for a passerby to ask in on the action and be kindly welcomed. Fascinating. There are quite a few little revelations like this throughout, some are quite strange and some sort of make sense.

Some notables include:

1) There is a A.A. in France! And they do the same 12 step program! In French! Now, how cute is that
2) Apparently there is still gulag in Russia. When people escape from it they end up in Cote D'Azure and Paris. This happens so often that Gendarmerie actually has a direct phone link with la Rus that is also used to to email photos of suspects to each other.
3) French cops for some strange reason are almost always plain clothed.
4) There are no fat people in all of France.
5) A typical lunch is quite different from the US, for example order of couscous, or steak with fries or rabbit stew are all valid choices in a neighborhood brasserie. I guess that explains #4 above.
6) There are women on French SWAT teams
7) Women are generally good looking, even the ones on the SWAT team
and
8) There are French cops of Arab descent --I actually think it is exaggeration and was put in for political correctness reasons

Without going into much detail or giving up the plot, this is actually a really nice movie, it is a bit slow at times, but the plot works, the sequence of events is believable (if sad at times) and it provides for a much welcome distraction from endless Law and Order reruns.
