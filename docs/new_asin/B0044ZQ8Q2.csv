I bought this Blu-ray disc from the UK two months ago, and I rate it very highly for Mattila, for sound quality and for Robert Carsen's staging (which is not traditional).",1294358400,4,335,4.694915254237288
8416390,4,B0044ZQ8Q2,"Bought this a year ago, played it once and shelved it. For me, it's wasn't the equal of the Glyndebourne production, missing its earthy realism, and Mattila not quite capturing the burgeoning, girlish sexuality Nancy Gustafson finds in the Katia. Additionally, the secondary roles weren't realized as clearly, Felicity Palmer in Glyndebourne  producing a cameo as the overbearing, sadistic mother. Above all, I found Carsen's set a distraction with dancers pulling out all the stops to stay upright on tippy, floating boards.
Giving it a second try, I must say I've modified this view considerably. In contrast with Glyndebourne, this production brings out the work's symbolism and if that sacrifices the feel of rural Russia, the deep-seated prejudices and superstitions and basic instincts of the peasantry, it retains and even enhances the sense of claustophobia that oppresses and eventually kills Katia. I still think Glyndebourne's secondary roles are better realized, all of them a bit undercharacterized here. But Mattila's Katia is a valid alternative to Gustafson's, more mature certainly and her frustrations more complex, a mix of thwarted ambition and disillusion perhaps. Carsen's set still annoys (floating opera has become a bit of a cliche) but I have to say his portrayal of Katia's suicide is far more convincing and emotionally excoriating than Lehnhoff's.
Sound and video on this blu ray are outstanding and here I have to tip my hat to FRA. The second time I tried it, their disc wouldn't play on either of my machines. My Amazon return deadline was long past so I wrote to FRA who replaced the disc at no cost. Excellent customer service and the replacement plays beautifully.",1486598400,,1699,5.178181818181818
8416391,1,B0044ZQ8Q2,"This opera's venue has been ""revised,"" from a sea town, in 1860s Russia, to what appears to be the 1940s, on a floating, reformable pier. Don't waste you time and money, as I did.",1460332800,,179,4.294117647058823
8416392,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"Ktia Kbanova is Janek's 6th opera. He wrote it between 1919 and 1921, when he was in the throes of a great yearning for the company of Kamila Stsslova, a married woman whom he had met in 1917. Ktia's is a tragic story; in the temporary absence of her husband, she has an affair with a younger man, Boris; and then, overcome with guilt, she throws herself into the Volga. Although I have known and loved much of Janek's music for 50 years, and had opportunity to play some of it; until now, I had not heard any of this music.  It is powerful stuff, and in this production it is sung and played superbly well.  Some of the orchestral writing, and its playing under the direction of Jii Blohlvek is absolutely spine-chilling, especially in the first scene of Act 3. Karita Mattila as Ktia is outstanding, and Miroslav Dvorsk as Boris is also excellent.  This recording is also notable for the appearance of Oleg Bryak in the role of Dikoj. Together with his colleague, Maria Radner, he died tragically in the GermanWings plane disaster on 24th March, 2015, and to date this appears to be his only commercially available recording. As evidenced here, he was a fine singer, with a powerful stage presence in his role as a rich merchant, and harbinger of doom for the guilt-ridden Ktia.

Robert Carsens production is dominated by water, in which all life began and on which all life depends; one day it may wash away all trace of us. In nature water is a powerful element, and on stage it is powerful symbolism.

8416393,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"I saw this opera in Prague and the young guy sitting next to me (a set designer) recommended this DVD as the best opera production, settings, performances etc. he had ever seen.  So I tracked it down and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  The DVD is good quality, the presentation excellent and of course, the music absolutely rivetting.  The singers are amazing and you will have hours of enjoyment (if not fun!!) watching and listening.  The production itself is super minimalist and creative, but pays great respect to the music of one of the world's greatest composers, Janacek.",1390867200,2,583,4.8
8416394,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"Leos Janacek composed a significant part of his work in the last two decades. A fulminating love with a young, then 25 years old, did the inspiration of the Czech composer emerge so overwhelming. The Smart Little Vixen, The House of the Dead, The case Makropolus and Katia Kabanova belong to this period of great inspiration. The three-act opera Katia Kabanova is, along with Jenufa, the masterpiece of the composer. Inspiration to the high threshold, which represents the pain of human love.
 Very personal song, written with short, repetitive phrases that do not conform to any genre. Janacek's operas have great arias and recitatives with characters rather simple, humble and some complex. The work is important in his music, which shows the personality of the characters. The orchestra narrates the action and it expresses profound emotions. The reports are supporting. Janacek constructs melodic lines appropriate to each character in his operas, music that reflects the feeling and character. In a unique beauty and lyricism that makes you cry the coldest of macho.
The recording released on DVD and Blu-Ray and the label Framus held at the Teatro Real in Madrid in 2009, has all the beauty of music by Janacek and more. A deep reading, novel and unique director Robert Carsen. The water surface present in all the stage and throughout the presentation is the main character of the events. Symbol of the Volga River, around it goes all the drama. Everything is Minin, with the absence of scenery and a light gradient in the background, which alternate colors in accordance with the unfolding of the piece; the backlight is mixed with a mirror that reflects the water scenes in a beautiful effect visual. An interpretation unforgettable, flawless and unity throughout the presentation. Modern opera of the highest quality, differentiated reading with intelligence following the libretto.
 The singers do not put your feet in the water: the dancers, nymphs or true lost souls of the Volga, shaping pieces of wood as the course of action. End up being part of the scenery. More chilling effect. Carsen often opts for speech over singing. The Philip Hirsch presented Rigoletto at the Teatro Municipal of So Paulo in 2011 used this same feature of the water surface in the third act. Must be pure coincidence.
Karita Mattila is a balance between singing and acting, in love and runs away from the tacky Katia is a seductive and melancholy. His voice has supreme issue, weight and a vibrant tone. One of the best performances of soprano video. The other soloists are in a state of grace: all interpret and assume their roles with realism and sing with consistency and safety.
  The Orchestra of the Teatro Real Madrid plays with passion and enthusiasm, seems familiar with the difficult passages of lyrical Janacek. The governing Jir Behlolvek is powerful and stable. Understand the pervasive music of the composer and transposes into the theater. The digital image on Blu-Ray is of great quality, and interviews with the director and the conductor further enhance the ideas contained in the function. One of the best releases of 2011.

DVD CRTICA: O Espelho d'gua de Katia kabanova.

  Leos Jancek comps parte expressiva de sua obra nas duas ltimas dcadas de vida. Um amor fulminante por uma jovem, de ento 25 anos de idade, fez a inspirao do compositor tcheco aflorar de maneira arrebatadora. A Raposinha Esperta, Da casa dos Mortos, O caso Makropolus e Katia Kabanova pertencem a esse perodo de grande inspirao. A pera em trs atos Katia Kabanova , ao lado de Jenufa, a obra prima do compositor. Inspirao elevada ao limite, que representa a dor apaixonada do ser humano.
 Msica extremamente pessoal, composta com frases curtas e repetitivas que no se adaptam a nenhum gnero. peras de Jancek no tm grandes rias e sim recitativos com personagens simples, humildes e alguns deles complexos. O importante em sua obra  a msica, que mostra a personalidade dos personagens. A orquestra narra a ao, e nela expressa profundas emoes. As falas so coadjuvantes. Jancek constri linhas meldicas adequadas a cada personagem de suas peras, msica que reflete o sentimento e o carter . De beleza nica e um lirismo que faz chorar o mais frio dos machistas.
A gravao lanada em DVD e Blu-Ray pelo selo FraMusica e realizada no Teatro Real de Madri, em 2009, tem toda beleza da msica de Jancek e muito mais. Uma leitura profunda, indita e singular do diretor Robert Carsen. O espelho d'gua presente em todo o palco e durante toda a apresentao  o personagem principal dos eventos. Smbolo mximo do Rio Volga, em torno dele se passa todo o drama. Tudo  mnino, com a ausncia de cenrio e uma luz em degrad no fundo do palco, onde cores se alternam de acordo com o desenrolar da pea; a luz do fundo se mescla a um espelho que reflete as cenas aquticas, em um lindo efeito visual. Uma interpretao inesquecvel, irretocvel e com unidade durante toda a apresentao. pera moderna da melhor qualidade, leitura diferenciada com inteligncia que segue o libreto.
 Os cantores no colocam os ps na gua: as danarinas, verdadeiras ninfas ou almas perdidas do rio Volga, moldam peas de madeira conforme o desenrolar da ao. Acabam sendo parte do cenrio. Mais um efeito de arrepiar. Carsen muitas vezes opta pela expresso em detrimento do canto. O Rigoletto de Felipe Hirsch apresentado no Teatro Municipal de So Paulo em 2011 utilizou esse mesmo recurso do espelho d'gua no terceiro ato. Deve ser pura coincidncia.
Karita Mattila encontra um equilbrio entre canto e encenao, foge da cafonice apaixonada e faz uma Katia sedutora e melanclica. Sua voz tem sublime emisso, peso e um timbre pujante. Uma das melhores atuaes desse soprano em vdeo. Os demais solistas esto em estado de graa: todos interpretam e assumem seus papis com realismo e cantam com consistncia e segurana.
  A Orquestra do Teatro Real de Madri toca com paixo e entusiasmo, parece familiarizada com as difceis passagens lricas de Jancek. A regncia de Jir Behlolvek  possante e estvel. Entende a penetrante msica do compositor e a transpe no teatro. A imagem digital em Blu-Ray  de grande qualidade, e as entrevistas com o diretor e o regente realam ainda mais as ideias contidas na funo. Um dos melhores lanamentos de 2011.

8416395,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"Janacek (1854-1928) in 1919,at the age of 65, composed in the last ten years of his life, four major operas,and works such as the Sinfonietta and the Glagolitic Mass. These last operas made little headway before the Second World War, apart from Jenufa, which made his reputation in Czechoslovakia and the German speaking world. His preoccupation with Moravian folk music, enriched his music language.

Katya Kabanova was adapted from a Russian play by Janacek. His inspiration for Katya was Puccini's Madam Butterfly and a Mrs Stosslova,38 years younger then him and married,so was he.  He met her while on holiday with his wife in 1917. This was a one sided passionate relationship on his part which resulted in over 7OO letters. She was the inspiration for the other three operas. She never understood him or his work.  The premiere took place in Brno in November 1921.

The opera takes place in a small Russian village around 1860. Katia is bullied by her mother in law,and has a husband Tichon who is weak. She has an affair with Boris while Tichon is away. She then tells everyone. Boris is sent away to Siberia, where else, filthy swine. Katia(Katya) then commits suicide in the nearby Volga. In case you think this is all very depressing, this opera is Janacek's most lyrical work and has some extremely beautiful music. No wonder Janacek was inspired by Butterfly. This opera has the same effect.

The new edition of this opera has been prepared by the late Australian conductor, Sir Charles Mackerras. He went a long away in promoting Janacek. The Orchestra of the Teatro Real, Madrid, is conducted by Jiri Belohlavek in a very passionate fashion. Ladies be prepared to weep. Men resort to the traditional stiff upper lip. Directed by Robert Carsen. He uses the river Volga,represented by water on the stage. Ladies dressed in white, place planks in various postions, to represent walkways, a house and garden. You may sniff and think, modern rubbish. Far from it. Katia is sung by Karita Mattila. She makes the part real. All the singers and choir are good. The costumes seem to be set in the 1910's. I may be wrong. Minimalist staging with effective back drops all make this a very emotional experience. An extremely wonderful performance and should be in every opera lovers collection.",1309392000,11,2297,4.87948717948718
8416396,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"Every fan of Karita Mattila will adore this.  I wish they didn't have everyone walking on floating boards over water, and indeed it's a miracle no one fell in, but aside from that, the production is sparse and concentrated, focusing on relationships, which is what Mattila does best.  She's super, as she always is in Janacek.  Beautiful, sustained notes full of emotion.  Although getting to the end of her career, she manages always, through gestures and expressions, to convey youth's mixed feelings and thoughts.",1306713600,,516,5.107142857142857
8416397,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"This is a very concise opera as operas go, less than two hours. Every single word and note is there for a reason, thus a minimalistic staging is a very appropriate one. The stage is on water which, in addition to the symbolism of the Volga River, creates beautiful effects and images. The reflections on the water and the waves on it fill the stage without having to have anything else. This is a case were a great filming director created images and effects that are much better than what you could see in the theater, mostly by using different view angles and different reflections. Bluray serves this staging perfectly giving striking details of the waves on the water. Janacek music is just beautiful, helping express the characters internal thoughts and feelings. Katia's music couldn't be better created to makes us feel her struggle with herself and the sincere and pure qualities of her soul. Mattila does and incredible good job with her voice. Her acting is sometimes hindered by her fear to slip on the wet floor showing some hesitation in her movements. The cast is good and into their characters. A modern interpretation that enhances the composer's work. Strongly recommended",1301788800,3,1189,4.891089108910891
8416398,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"I liked Robert Carsen's stage design for the NY Met production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eugene-Onegin/dp/B001CZVVW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eugene Onegin</a>, where he employed a large three-sided ""light-box"" with minimal props, but made use of the lighting and autumnal colours to perfectly complement the tone of Tchaikovsky's dramatic and emotionally turbulent opera. Carsen's Brechtian design for Katia Kabanova at Madrid's Teatro Real in 2008 is similarly austere and emotionally resonant, and again it seems to me to be perfectly complementary for an opera whose storyline has the potential to be melodramatic, yet is served so much better if it is coolly and delicately underplayed.

The emotion is downplayed in this production on almost every front of the theatrical presentation to better let the music and the singing speak for itself. The staging is restricted to boarding that is rearranged by what seems like water-nymphs or drowned lost souls, and rests on a couple of inches of water. The intention is to evoke the presence of the Volga, where the drama takes place in the little town of Kalinov, and emphasise the importance of the location and the significance that water plays throughout. If the concept is a little over-pronounced, it nonetheless proves highly effective, creating a calming impression, occasionally showing ripples and casting reflections on the mirrored background. With the use of lighting - impeccably lit and coloured - it establishes a perfect location that connects with the emotional resonance of the drama, without being too heavy-handed or obvious in the symbolism. It just feels absolutely right and it looks marvellous.

The reason why it feels perfect, is that it supports the important elements of the performance without imposing a false presence that could either overstate or take away from the intent of Jancek's score - wonderfully played by the Teatro Real Orchestra conducted by Jiri Belohlavek - or indeed from the fine performances and singing. Katya is a complex character who undergoes some quite brutal treatment and yet remains despite of it all in thrall to her interior life, and it's all too easy to highlight the grimness of the external drama at the expense of the beauty of the person inside. The only other staging I've seen of the opera placed emphasis - quite effectively, as it happens - on a recreation of a grim East European tenement block - but the concept here seems much more imaginative and in tune with the tone of the music. The contrast in Katya's personality can also lead to over-emphasis bordering on madness, but Karita Mattila finds a perfect balance here in her acting performance and in her singing, exuberant in the right places, despairing in others, but reserved and internalised where necessary at the key moments.

Everything is pretty much as it should be in terms of the technical specifications of the FRA Blu-ray disc. A 1080i encode, presented in 16:9 widescreen, the image looks slightly soft, perhaps on account of the low lighting, but it fully captures the tones of the subdued but limpid lighting. The soundtrack comes with the standard PCM and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes, both of which perform well. The surround mix disperses the orchestration effectively, but on an empty stage the singing can seem a little echoing at times. It's never less than powerful however. Really, High Definition and opera is a match made in heaven and this disc shows why. The Blu-ray includes a 24-minute interview with Robert Carsen and Jiri Belohlavek. In the spirit of the production, the booklet includes a detailed synopsis that doubles as a fine interpretative essay on the opera.",1295395200,11,3731,5.256711409395973
8416399,5,B0044ZQ8Q2,"How likely can it be that TWO (2) DVDs of an opera by Leos Janacek would be released in the same year, 2010, and that both would be musically excellent, and yet that the two would be so utterly dissimilar in dramatic concept that it makes sense, for a Janacek fan at least, to hear and see both? Well, friends, that's what has happened, and our beloved amazoo-keepers were understandably befuddled by the coincidence. This production, starring Karita Mattila in the title role, became available In Europe months ago but not in the USA. Meanwhile, the other production, starring Angela Denoke at the Salzburg Festival, was available month earlier, and I reviewed it almost immediately. That five-star review got magically posted on this product page. I notified the zookeepers and lo! the glitch has been fixed.

Here's a portion of the review I wrote about the other DVD:  In a Janacek opera, it's the orchestra that narrates, that expresses the strongest passions and comments most profoundly on the 'content' of the drama. ""Katia Kabanova"" is a tragic story of emotional abuse, adultery, betrayal, and suicide. The human drama could scarcely be darker, and yet without a speck of Pucciniesque melodrama. This bleak scenario, nevertheless, is wrapped in a rapturous orchestral 'commentary' that affirms the beauty of passion, the immanence of the Life Force even in cruelty and folly. Janacek's passion for Life swells in all of his music. The five operas of his that you're likely to hear/see are all tragic, all psychologically and intellectually dark, but the music soars above depression. The sheer glory of Life transcends the pain of Living.

That other production stages the opera 'anachronistically' in a Soviet-era housing project; it treats Janacek's love-suicide drama as a social tragedy in a specifically dysfunctional family and community. This production takes the diametrically opposite approach, eliminating even the 'peasant village' setting of Janacek's libretto, and universalizing the themes of tragedy. I sincerely do appreciate both concepts, but I'm almost certain that most audiences will prefer the second, especially since it's beautifully executed.

In this production, the stage is flooded with an inch or two of water, representing both the river that is central to the drama and the fluid beauty of LIfe as it flows past us. Water spirits -- I THINK that's what they are, as well as being dancers and chorus -- slide wooden gangways from configuration to configuration to represent the scenes of the village, and the singers chiefly act their roles on these gangways. Almost all the cast goes barefoot in the shallow water, slithering through it to make shimmering swirls and eddies under the lights. It's all as beautiful as starlight on surf, and above all it frees the audience's imagination to attend to the affect of the music.

Karita Mattila is divine. Whoever sings Katia needs to be divine. Denoke is very fine vocally, in that other production, but Mattila was born to sing this role. All the other musical elements are superb as well, making this one of the very best opera DVDs I've ever heard/watched.

Here's a list of Janacek's nine operas, with their English titles:
Sarka (1887)
The Beginning of a Romance (1894)
Jenufa (1904) - available on 2 DVDs
Osud (1904) - available on CD
The Excusions of Mr. Broucek (1920) - on CD
Katia Kabanova (1921) - on 3 DVDs
The Cunning Little Vixen (1924) - on 4 DVDs
The Makropoulos Case (1926) - on DVD
From the House of the Dead (1927) - on an excellent DVD

One might get the impression that Janacek's day has dawned!",1294876800,19,3603,4.985024958402662
