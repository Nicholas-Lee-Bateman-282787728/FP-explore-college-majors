8061850,3,B0009J6KI8,"If you like silly, comfortably familiar spaghetti Westerns, then here you go. If you want to see a really good movie, then look elsewhere. But if you want to turn off your mind and watch the bullets fly then this is your flick. The acting is pedestrian (except for the horses -- they did really good jobs), the script predictable and quality of the picture is poor due to the (I guess) deterioration of the film. What I really liked were the horses. There is a lot of charging around on horseback here and a bay even pretends to act up as part of a stunt. But some of the horses were really beautiful. I focused as best I could and widened my eyes -- some of them look to be pure-blood Arabians. Since this film was shot in Israel, perhaps the local horses used in the film included many Arabs and half-Arabs. Also two gorgeous draft mules.",1503792000,,840,4.322784810126582

8061858,4,B0009J6KI8,"Set in the mediterranean and in the exotic Moroccan city of Tangiers. This B&W film has a subtle but suspenseful feel. The treachory and plotting of the main characters especially George Sanders as a soldier of fortune, gives this thriller a ""Bogart-like"" feel.

Based on a premise of rescueing six people from a political refugee ship, Sanders finds more than he bargained for when he encounters a wealthy and worrisome widow (Agnes Moorehead), a shady sea captain and a dengerous dame with amorous intentions.

A web of intigue mixed with greed, revealing a shocking double cross and unexpected ending.
