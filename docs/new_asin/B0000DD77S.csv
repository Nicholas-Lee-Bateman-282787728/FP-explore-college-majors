1924236,5,B0000DD77S,"Born To Be Bad is a very good pre-Code film even though it had to be somewhat reworked at the last minute because the new Hayes Code was becoming the law of the land. The plot moves along well; I wasn't bored for a minute and the snappy one-liners, especially by Loretta Young, Jackie Kelk and Cary Grant make the picture even better! The cinematography and choreography work well and the quality of the print, which I watched on television, was actually rather good! There's also some suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat.

When the film starts, we meet Letty Strong (Loretta Young), a promiscuous woman who gets paid to spend romantic time with men. Letty became pregnant and unmarried at the age of fifteen and it was only through the kindness and generosity of a stranger--now a friend, named ""Fuzzy"" (Henry Travers), that she and her son Mickey (Jackie Kelk) were able to survive. Although Letty looks happy when she's an escort, in reality she is angry with the world and she teaches her young son Mickey to lie, cheat, steal, skip school , literally fight for what he wants and more so that he won't grow up to be taken advantage of the way she was.

One day Mickey is injured when a truck driven by the president of Amalgamated Dairies (Malcolm Trevor, played by Cary Grant) hits Mickey. Although Mickey's injuries are really not serious, Letty and her crooked lawyer Adolph (Harry Green) concoct a plan to get as much money as they can out of Malcolm so Letty and Mickey never have to worry about money again--and Letty can stop being a paid ""romantic"" escort for men. Yet the court trial doesn't go as planned--Letty loses her son to the court and social workers. When Malcolm intervenes to take Mickey in and raise him as his own along with Malcolm's wife Alyce (Marion Burns), Letty sees an opportunity to steal Malcolm away from Alyce and live a life of incredible luxury.

Of course, there's more to the plot; I won't write much more to avoid giving out spoilers. Suffice it to say that the plot remains intriguing.

I highly recommend Born To Be Bad for fans of the actors in it; people who enjoy films from the pre-Code era will want to get this film as well. True, the Hayes Code made the final edition of the film more mellow; but it still has enough of that pre-Code quality to it that I always enjoy!",1358035200,,2328,4.49645390070922

1924238,4,B0000DD77S,"I bought this DVD mainly because I really love Cary Grant in just about anything (well, there's a couple of his films that are stinkers but that's for another time). One of my all time favorite films of his is The Bishop's Wife, which also stars Loretta Young. It's really hard to imagine Loretta (usually the pious pillar of virtue in most of her films) actually being the bad girl from the wrong side of the tracks - but that's exactly what she is in this film. If you like Cary Grant (or Loretta Young), it's worth it to buy this DVD (even better when it's on sale).",1320278400,4,569,4.277777777777778
1924239,3,B0000DD77S,"""Born to be Bad"", made by Twentieth Century Pictures before they merged with Fox, is a fast moving pre-code melodrama possibly made as Daryl F. Zanuck's response to Warner's ""Baby Face"" and MGM's ""Red Headed Woman"". The interest in the film today is that Loretta Young plays against type as a promiscuous dame with an illegitimate son whom she raises to defy any sort of authority. Young is on record as loathing the film, not the least for the morals, or lack of, which the film depicts. However, that judgement ignores that here is the sexy radiant Young playing a tough  broad very convincingly.  A wooden Cary Grant plays opposite her.

The print is OK and there are no extras. The DVD is quite expensive and only worth seeing for Young.",1236297600,5,741,4.641221374045801
1924240,3,B0000DD77S,"Effective Pre-Code drama starring Loretta Young in a role light years away from her virtuous characters in films like ""The Bishop's Wife"" and ""The Farmer's Daughter"".

BORN TO BE BAD stars Cary Grant and Marion Burns as married couple Malcolm and Alyce Trevor, whose lives are almost destroyed by scheming single mother Letty Strong (Loretta Young), when her son is injured by one of the milk trucks owned by the Trevors' large dairy company. Taking Malcolm all the way to the bank - literally - Letty's blackmail and bitchery eventually leads to her predictable ruin...

Marion Burns gamely plays Grant's rather passive and uninteresting wife (she was much more enjoyable in Monogram's ""Sensation Hunters"" which is available via Alpha Video); BORN TO BE BAD is mainly notable for the pairing of Grant and Young, thirteen years before their most celebrated co-starring vehicle, ""The Bishop's Wife"".

Co-starring Jackie Kelk and Henry Travers, BORN TO BE BAD will interest Cary Grant completists and Pre-Code fans; the performance of Loretta Young should make it a worthwhile title for casual viewers as well. (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1213056000,4,1143,5.269230769230769

1924242,2,B0000DD77S,"Movie: **  DVD Quality: **  DVD Extras: ****

I've seen enough of Loretta Young's and Cary Grant's early work to know that this movie surely represents some kind of nadir for both stars.  Despite their considerable skills, no one could possibly turn this sow's ear of a script into anything resembling a decent film.  Loretta plays a 22-year-old never- married mother of a 7-year-old son; the kid is being raised to be just as morally compromised as Mom.  Enter Cary as a victim of one of their scams; before you can say, ""What the hey?!!!?"", Cary and his wife are raising Loretta's son ... Loretta's moving in on Cary to get her boy back ... Cary's wife is all-forgiving of her husband's dalliance ... Loretta does the ""noble"" thing by walking away and abandoning her son to Cary and wife's care.  This all takes a scant 61 minutes that drags on f-o-r-e-v-e-r because no one does anything but talk, talk, and talk ... oh! they also slam doors - lots of doors - in Cary's lavish mansion.  It couldn't have been fun for the actors to make this rubbage, but at least they must have known enough to stay away from the finished film!

Certainly whoever wrote the insert notes for this Fox Home Video release never watched the movie!  They identify Cary's character as a ""dairy farmer"" (he's actually the very wealthy head of a dairy corporation); they name aged 50-something character player Henry Travers (Clarence the Angel in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") as the actor playing Loretta's 7-year-old son; and they describe the film as a ""heartwarming, well-made classic"" as well as a ""gripping classic"" (maybe they had this confused with Cary and Loretta's later film, ""The Bishop's Wife"", which really is a classic).

I doubt that whoever was in charged of transferring the film to video paid much attention to the movie, either.  The picture is grainy throughout with some noticeable jumps (indicating bad splices); and the sound is frequently muddy as well. At least Fox doesn't claim it was restored.  There is a nice selection of trailers from other movies Grant starred in at Fox, including ""I Was a Male War Bride"" (1949), ""People Will Talk"" (1951), ""Monkey Business"" (1952), ""Kiss Them For Me"" (1957), and ""An Affair to Remember"" (1957) ... but the trailer to this film isn't among them.  There's also a small photo gallery.

Overall, I can't in good conscience recommend this DVD to anyone except the most diehard Young and Grant fans.  But if for some reason you insist on watching it, check out the jurors in the trial scene ... doesn't the man on the front row to the right of your screen bear a resemblance to the producer of the film, Darryl F. Zanuck?",1102032000,43,2658,4.696120689655173
1924243,5,B0000DD77S,"I don't want to be too extensive. I only want to tell you this short (61 minutes of running time) Pre-Code, is a goody-goody, with Cary Grant, and especially Loretta Young, who is great in it...she looks ravishing, great gowns, slim-fitted, beautiful face-eyes, fresh beauty, great spunk.

I cannot understand why (I've read it) Loretta was ""stereotyped"" and ""dismissed"", mainly in the 1930's as being a so-so or bad actress, and being only a ""clotheshorse""...untrue...she's radiantly good (Well BAD) (chuckles) here.

It's difficult to think of this LORETTA...when one thinks of the 1940's Loretta in ""The Farmer's Daughter""....or her other teaming with Cary Grant, the excellent & cute & sentimental ""The Bishop's Wife""...a completely different stuff.

I wanna watch more early '30s Loretta, not only her virginal-good characters (like ""Zoo in Budapest"" (I'd ""kill"" to see this one) or ""The Crusades"" (here she's mostly ""decorative"" IMHO)....but stuff like ""Midnight Mary"" (I've read it's TOP) ""Employee's Entrance"", ""Taxi"". ""The Hatchet Man"".....

The quality of the DVD is pretty good.

Pre-Code lovers watch it!",1095120000,18,1116,5.465116279069767
1924244,2,B0000DD77S,"""Born to Be Bad"" is a very uncharacteristic Cary Grant movie. Uncharacteristic because it's at the beginning of his career, features him in an almost non-comedic role and has him cast as a man double-crossed by a woman of easy virtue in an almost maudelin plot. The story concerns Grant hitting the son of a woman of easy virtue (Loretta Young) with his car. He then having to make the mends. The rest is pure melodrama but pulled off with such panache that you'd scarcely mind any of the hockum. Truly, this is a very, very good movie.
TRANSFER: Unfortunately the same can't be said for FOX's transfer. We get a very dirty, very gritty, very grainy transfer that - although free of digital anomalies - is so heavily damanged by age that seeing the film is hardly worth the effort. Black and contrast levels are extremely weak, fine detail is lost in practically every scene and the ravages of time are glaring and obvious throughout. The audio hasn't been cleaned up either for a slight hiss and some unexpected pops along the way.
EXTRAS: Trailers from the other Grant films. Boring, unworthy and disappointing.
BOTTOM LINE: Someone should point out to studio executives that films pre-Star Wars are worth the time, effort and, oh yes, the MONEY that is required to make them sparkle like they did when they were premiered. Really, history is getting shafted here!!!",1075248000,23,1368,4.7521008403361344

8000704,3,B0000DD77S,"Loose women, you know, tramps, have never had an even break in the cinema as the film under review, Born To Be Bad, once again demonstrates. And that is rather a shame since as an old reprobate corner boy who got mixed up in his fair share of trouble just for having grown up on the wrong side of the tracks and had been dragged into the life of the simple reason that it looked interesting, more interesting than whatever was being prescribed for the poor working people in the old neighborhood, including my parents, can sympathizes with a girl who has to do what a girl has to do.

So yes, I could sympathize with Letty (played by a too beautiful Loretta Young) as she does what a gal has to do to keep a roof over her head. Oh yeah, and here is the twist line on this one, and keep a roof over her very young sons head. See Letty was attracted by the bright lights early, got caught up with something, someone who promised her the moon and then left her high and dry. Not a very good fate now, but probably worse back in the time of this film in the 1930s.

The way this familiar story goes is that once Letty had crossed the line (had a child out of wedlock) she was damaged goods, she was any mans woman. And she played that part to a tee she since she still had some dreams of turning her good looks and world-weary and wise ways into a pot of gold. And she got a chance, a fortuitous chance when her son Mickey, at seven going on eight already heading on the wrong road, got hit by a truck. Got hit by a truck owned by rich and prosperous Mal (played by Cary Grant). So she does what any self-respecting corner cutter would do, hires a lawyer to milk the situation for what it is worth. No go though since guys like Mal do not become rich and prosperous by being conned by little tramps. Mickeys so-called injuries were exposed as a hoax in court by Mals high priced legal team. Worse, the judge tried to move might and main to have Mickey taken from her and had him placed in an institution. While Letty might have been less than the ideal mother she did really in her own way love her son and so she maneuvered her way into having childless Mal and his wife take the boy in. But that was only for starters since her real plan was to seduce Mal and use that evidence to blackmail him into giving up Mickey. But if you were paying attention you know that Mal did not get where he was by playing the fool, well fully playing the fool. Sure he fell for Letty, fell hard, but two things got in the way. Mickey liked his new set-up and Mal really wanted to set up a life with her. In the end though she gave him the air, and after some anguish left Mickey in place too. Like I said Hollywood has been tough on loose women, you know, little tramps.",1429660800,2,2751,4.121042830540037
8000705,5,B0000DD77S,"The highlight of this movie is Loretta Young playing a single mother and leading a wayward life. In fact she plays a bad mother completely ignoring the welfare of her son and even goes to the extent of bilking a fortune (in a fabricated law-suit) from a wealthy couple played by Cary Grant and Marion Burns. This is one of the several movies that Hollywood made openly challenging the moral code prescribed by Hay's office. Many reviewers have rated this movie poorly, since it deals with a 'trashy' story. I liked the performance of Loretta Young doing her best to portray the ""image"" of a bad mom. Cary Grant's performance is acceptable. In fact he had just finished doing his best performances with Marlene Dietrich (""Blonde Venus"") and May West (""She done him wrong"" and ""I'm no angel"").",1415232000,,791,4.739130434782608

8000707,4,B0000DD77S,"Love this film, one of the last of the pre-production code movies.  Loretta Young, as the single mother with a son just out of reform school, shows some legs and flesh in a bathrobe early in the film while playing around with her boy.  Then, when her boy gets run over by a dairy truck driven by the company owner, Cary Grant, the later apologizes for the incident, so much so, that he and his wife adopt the boy after the judge rules that the boy's mother is unfit to raise a child due to her wild, aloof, manner.  When the boy comes to live with the company owner and his wife, he becomes homesick for his mom and tries to run away.  But, mom tells the boy to stay with the couple, leading to an attraction between bad girl and company girl.  This movie was made by 20th Century Pictures (later 20th Century Fox when it merged with Fox) and borrowed Grant from Paramount to team with studio player Young.  Their chemistry couldn't have been better.  He debonair and suave, and she the deviant mom.  And opposites win out, here.
