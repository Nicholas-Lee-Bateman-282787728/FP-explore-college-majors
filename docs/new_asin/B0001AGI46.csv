1984188,5,B0001AGI46,"Relatively unheard of in the states until its release last year, this Italian gem from 1954 unveils the unmistakable comedic skills of an unknown Marcello Mastroianni and almost equally unknown (cinematically speaking) Sophia Loren, whose performances here are the European equivalant of those of Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn films of the late 30`s. These two bounce lines off one another effortlessly, at times speaking over and under each other at breakneck pace, their timing impeccable and jarring, their physical gestures and tapdancing body language in itself hysterical. Add Vittorio De Sica`s suave, smooth-talking, sleight-of-hand magic to the mix and what you have is a bawdy, blissful, charming Post-War comedy from that time period. Alessandro Blasetti`s direction is skillful and artful, making this a must-see if you`re a fan of any or all of the three leads. The only negative thing is that, like most imports fom those days, the only dialogue that`s subtitled is the essential dialogue, so other witty lines are omitted completely, which is a shame because it would be even funnier if we had translations of ALL the dialogue. The pricetag is hefty but the payoff is big, I recommend this one highly.",1267488000,6,1215,5.235897435897436
1984189,5,B0001AGI46,"If you're a red-blooded male with a pulse - who is conscious and still breathing - you'll appreciate this classic Italian farce and its ravishing main attraction.  Mere words can't begin to describe the breathtaking, 19 year-old Sophia Loren.  Trust me; my eyeballs still hurt from popping out of my head!  (...Oh yeah, I almost forgot - what's-his-face and whosis are in it, too.)",1258416000,6,381,4.921875
1984190,5,B0001AGI46,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie; It's fun and interesting to start out with, when Sophia Loren and her pals try to steal poor Marcello's beloved taxi, and Loren is unbelievably sexy, but the movie really takes off with the entrance of Desica who seems to be having the time of his life as an older thief bemoaning the crude methods of the younger generation of thieves. This movie is almost like Bringing Up Baby Italian Style; the wacky unpredictable woman and the befuddled bumbling man who is both in love with her and totally exasperated with her. Best of all, the movie gets better and better, climaxing with a terrific farcical sequence aboard a bus and culminating in a police station/courthouse scene that once again mirrors the American comedies of the 30's only with a distinctly Italian Flavor. Well worth seeing for so many reasons!",1231804800,5,858,4.804054054054054
1984191,4,B0001AGI46,"It is quite a kick to see Ms Loren and Senori DeSica & Mastroianni so ageless! They look practically the same decades later as they did in this 50s flick, ""Too Bad She's Bad"". Marcello is the beefcake straight guy, Sophia is the devastating lure and Vittorio is hilarious as a hapless ageing carpetbagger and thief. And the old cars are great to see in their real original condition.
This Morality Tale is told with humour in the poverty of post war Italy. You get a sense of the renewal of energy of a people who were kicked around by the fascists then intruded upon by the allies. The characters seem to be breathing easier a decade after the war's end and the fun has come back into the Italian psyche.
Of course, Sophia's luscious beauty is enough but seeing her with her colleagues as they were beginning their breakthrough into international stardom is a treat, too.
I really enjoyed this romp into Italian cinema history but the gags are still funny - especially Vittorio's little hollow thief satchel that is mechanically faulty preventing him from successfully robbing people - a very funny tongue-in-cheek metaphor for the haplessness of the post Mussolini infrastructure.",1217808000,,1182,4.827586206896552
1984192,4,B0001AGI46,"A very entertaining film, the first teaming of the 3, as you most likely know. And Sophia. Oh my! So beautiful at such an early age! They just ran this on TCM, great print, so you know the DVD will look good as well. Was shocked to see a very brief nipple slip, as she was changing behind a bush while on the beach....if she had stopped one foot sooner, she wouldn't have shown anything! thank goodness she went just a little further! :)",1212710400,6,437,4.214285714285714
1984193,5,B0001AGI46,"A fun film to watch. Great Italian sense of humor. Sofia at the time when she and other actresses like Marilyn Monroe could show some curves and not be considered obese (as our anorexic actresses of today's film industry are.) The group of pickpockets and scam artists are hilarious and Marcello Mastroianni as a cabbie more obsessed with his shiny car than with his passion for Sofia (or is he) is a comic example of the boys with toys complex.
Director Alessandro Blasetti never was fully appreciated in America, therefore his two other hits ""Altri Tempi"" and ""1860"" were never put into USA format.",1200096000,9,600,4.778846153846154
1984194,4,B0001AGI46,"This movie was enjoyable to watch for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was to witness the first time that Sophia Loren, Vittorio de Sica, and Marcello Mastroianni act together in a motion picture. It was a pleasant experience to hear ""La Loren"" speaking her native language after being so accustomed to seeing her in American pictures over the years. She displays much talent for comedy. Mastroianni, who was relatively unknown when this movie came out, ably shows his comedic ""chops"" and you know he is destined for greatness in the cinematic world. Vittorio de Sica, as always, is a thorough delight to watch. Seeing this picture made me want to find other Italian movies he made. If you can understand the language, this picture is even more enjoyable, but if not, I would still recommend it for the stars in it. Some of the best movies ever made are subtitled, and it is a provincial mind that dismisses these movies out of hand because they are either too lazy to read the subtitles or fear that they will not be able to follow the movie because the subtitles get in the way or go by too fast. That's what a pause button is for! Try it! You'll like it!",1188086400,23,1169,4.492957746478873
1984195,4,B0001AGI46,"Charming and funny. Loren, Mastroianni and De Sica have great chemistry from their very first collaboration! More than 50 years after it was made, the movie is still fresh and will keep your attention.",1186444800,10,201,4.9411764705882355
1984196,4,B0001AGI46,Great movie.  Kept my interest.  Sometimes movies this old will seem boring to our modern short attention spans but I never fast forwarded.  Loren is great.  He's great too.,1091836800,12,173,4.862068965517241

8009231,3,B0001AGI46,Just to let people know. The version of this film by Video Dimensions appears to be a burned (DVD R) type.,1443398400,,106,4.095238095238095
8009232,5,B0001AGI46,yes another one for my collection.sophia loren is just stunning.a must for all loren fans,1434240000,,89,5.0
8009233,5,B0001AGI46,"First Sophia Loren a ever saw, and it was LOVE at first sight.  What a beautiful and talented woman. wish I could have been her leading man.",1425340800,,140,4.185185185185185
8009234,3,B0001AGI46,"Too Bad Shes Bad is a very early teaming of the legendary screen couple Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren. The plot revolves around a family of thieves headed by Vittorio De Sica in post-war Rome and the guileless cab driver who gets romantically tangled up with the leaders daughter. It is all harmless if unremarkable fun with rapid fire dialogue: if you don't know Italian, be ready for some subtitle speed reading.

Three stars only (as in Its OK) for the Roman locales (almost no traffic around the Coliseum!), the joy of watching the leads and the tack sharp Anamorphic print (it will cover your entire HD flat panel without zooming in the picture - a rarity in Video Dimension releases). Recommended only to devoted fans of the leads; others might do better renting. Its not that special, but then there is the EXTRA!

The EXTRA: Much more interesting is the Luchino Visconti short subject My Turn starring Anna Magnani playing herself in a personal anecdote she shared with the director. Its all about stubbornness - diva style, and it is hilarious.",1424563200,,1061,4.824175824175824
8009235,4,B0001AGI46,"This is definitely a classic.  I got it because of Sophia Lauren, just to see her in her youth, which never died.  So I like it, of course I don't like the language being in Italian, but subtitle helps.",1418860800,,202,4.153846153846154
8009236,5,B0001AGI46,"What a find!  Just recently discovered this movie and what a treat.  For those who want to see the beginning of the Loren-Mastroianni magic together in cinema, buy this!  No doubt that the same magic that Hepburn and Tracy conjured up is matched by these two.  I believe Sophia was only 20 when this was filmed but her talent and beauty was already evident.  Add in the role of Vittorio de Sica (who would go on to direct these two in many classic Italian films down the road), and you have a delightful evening of watching three talented performers on the verge of becoming iconic stars.",1384128000,,588,4.509433962264151
8009237,5,B0001AGI46,The interplay among the three stars is what makes the movie. The plot is thin but is more than made up just watching the three. It is easy to see why Sohia & Marcello were destined to be stars.,1377907200,,193,3.9743589743589745
8009238,5,B0001AGI46,"This is a lovely movie with fantastic shots of Rome from the early 50s! I am a huge travel buff and those scenes of Rome were excellent!
And Sophia Loren is still a teen in this movie but Oh, mio Dio! lei  bella!! (Oh my God, She is BEAUTIFUL).
She sings like a canary and lovely acting.
Marcello Mastroianni is such a darling in this movie! Loved his character here...
Vittorio de Sica is so smooth in his acting. He gave the movie the much needed balance, what with the two dynamite twosome of Loren and Mastroianni.
And the B&W quality of the movie just adds to the nostalgic atmos of the era...
Great movie and a must have for all collections and lovers of either of the leading pair.
I worship the ground Sophia stands on and this goes to the top of that lovely collection.
If after reading this review, if you are still wondering why you should buy this, then this is really not for you. I say just look for a Jennifer Lopez blob instead..if you have any second thoughts about adding this to your collection ;)",1360713600,2,1016,4.319371727748691
8009239,4,B0001AGI46,"Delight in the Neapolitan trio of Loren, Mastroianni and De Sica.  Loren is enchantingly ornamental.  This is a charming and ageless con caper, Italian style!",1280880000,,158,5.28
