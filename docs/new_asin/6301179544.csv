313242,3,6301179544,"It's rather formulaic and predictable, and replacing A. Michael Baldwin with that kissy-faced failed model who can't act his way out of a paper bag was a terrible casting choice, but it does serve to advance the story arc somewhat. Thankfully, A. Michael Baldwin comes back into the series for 3, 4, and 5.",1499385600,,306,4.685185185185185

313244,5,6301179544,"This largely serves to continue the story and madness of Phantasm (1979).  If you enjoyed part 1, youll enjoy this.  If not, you wont.

So here we are 8 years after the events of Phantasm (1979) with writer/director Don Coscarelli (Phantasm 1-4, The Beastmaster, Bubba Ho-Tep).  A psychic girl (Paula Irvine; Phantasm III), Liz, has been keeping tabs on the Tall Man with her premonitions, Michael (James Le Gros) has just been released from a long stay in a psychiatric facility, and Reggie (Reggie Bannister; Phantasm 1-5, Wishmaster) somehow doesnt remember that anything from part 1 even happened.  Reggie and the psychiatrists say it was all just a dream Michael manifested to cope with the loss of his brother.

After Michael has a premonition that Reggies second house would explode (one in 1979, one now), now with his wife and child within, as a result of the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm; Phantasm 1-5, Subspecies, Wishmaster) and his army of ugly evil dwarveswell, Reggie just decides to believe Michael that evil is behind it and they set out searching the country for the Tall Man using Michaels newfound powers of dream clairvoyance.

 PSYCHIC-AMNESIAC SEQUEL SIDEBAR: Okay, this gets a bit confusing.  Completely different from Phantasm (1979), amnesia and psychic powers are prominent themes in this sequel.  There is no explanation for Reggies amnesia regarding the events of part 1, yet once he decides to believe Michaels story, he behaves as if he always knew everything about the Tall Man, his evil dwarves, his extra-dimensional nature, and his vile plans for our dead.  Likewise, Michaels powers just seem to be there as if they were always there.  As they are presented to us, these things are treated as if they have been constants.  Moreover, we now have psychic Liz and the Tall Man using telepathy.  Just go with it.

There are some great shots of country sidesa nice and unexpected touch in an 80s horror film.  During their trek they prepare, making a four-barrel shotgun and flamethrower, and follow the dilapidated remains of ghost towns and mass exhumed graveyards in the wake of the Tall Mans murderous influence as he builds his army of the dead.

Their journey finds many strange things, among them a woman with an awesomely gory slimy monstrous parasite delivering the Tall Mans messages, disappearing dead naked women in the morgue, a cute hitchhiker named Alchemy (Samantha Phillips; Dollman), a chainsaw fight with a low blow, a funny sex scene and, of course, the return of the blood-lusted spheresi.e., the floating metal balls from part 1 which now have some mechanized upgrades. You cant discuss these movies without mentioning the balls.  The effects were great, with the murderous chrome spheres flying throw the air (excellent and seamless rotoscoping, by the way), unsheathing blades and drills and buzz saws, impaling victims, and drilling into their heads!  The gore is sufficient as blood gushes in bright red and mustard yellow.

Overall the gore is very satisfying.  One of the ball scenes is among my favorites when the ball enters a mans back, bores through his torso and up his throat, and out his mouth.  The finale also has a melty, gooey flair to it.

Boasting a lot more dialogue, the Tall Man is somewhat hammed up in this sequel. But this is not a bad thing at all. Its a tad cheesy, but a lot of fun. Even more fun are the evil dwarves, which are far more numerous than part 1. We also see more about their creation and their other dimension as we pass through the gateway to another world again.  We don't really learn anything more than we knew in part 1, though.  The Tall Man is transforming dead people into his growling hooded dwarf servants and there is a portal to another dimension, to which he apparently outsources this labor forceto dosomething.  Maybe part 3 will have some answers.

Like part 1, the surprise ending is totally random, makes no sense at all, and hinders the series ability to continue to a part 3.  But, also like part 1, it seems more concerned with being looney than credible.  Perhaps it was all just a dream.

WHERE IS THIS ALL GOING SIDEBAR:  These somewhat sci-fi concepts from Phantasm (1979) are introducing us to a greater theme that is only partially realized in part 1, and unfortunately no more so in part 2.  As if world-building, youd think Coscarelli is setting the stage for something of grander scale by letting us know that these things exist, without getting into the whys.  In part 1, Michael visits a creepy fortune-teller and her telepathically linked granddaughter who subject him to a Dune-like fear box test.  But why?  Why are there truly supernatural diviners and why do they prepare young Michael for his future challenges (i.e., the Tall Man)?  Why does the Tall Man turn into a young woman, in a lavender dress in part 1 and the form of the cute hitchhiker in part 2, and why not someone else?

Theres a lot going on here.  The Tall Man is reanimating human corpses as evil compact dwarves so that their now denser bodies can handle the greater gravity of another planet, in which the dwarves serve as slaves.  We don't know why, or to do what, or exactly where or for whom.  This is all somehow revealed to Michael (through a telepathic link perhaps) when he momentarily passes the portal and witnesses the harsh world on the other side in part 1.  Is it Hell, or another planet in a nearby solar system?  Did this permanently give him the psychic powers that we find now in part 2?  Are there other portals?  Is the Tall Man the head bad guy, or the equivalent of a Vegas pit boss or regional salesman/recruiter?  Who knows?  After watching parts 1 and 2, we sure dont!  As far as ambitious stories go, Phantasm 1-2 are like the horror Avatar (2009) of the 1970s.

Unfortunately, after setting the stage we don't seem to take it anywhere new in part 2.  And yet again, Coscarelli uses a rather A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) style ending that could only confuse us more.

What makes this movie work is how satisfyingly unusual the story is.  Its weird and doesnt make much sense.  That said, I remain quite impressed with this original product.  This film may not feel organized, but it still has a lot of good to offer the genre and its story stands out even today.",1497139200,2,6287,4.720183486238532

313280,5,6301179544,"'Phantasm II' is one of my favorite horror films. I saw this one before seeing the original (this one came out when I was 17; the first came out when I was 8) and loved it. It was this film that inspired me to see the original that was just as likable. Director Don Coscarelli keeps a tight pace with this one, tighter than the first one but still quick enough to understand. Some reviewers are disappointed that Michael Baldwin did not return for this one; while he would have been good to see reprising the role, James LeGros still does an admirable job in the role of Mike. Returning from the original cast are Reggie Bannister as Reggie & the late, great Angus Scrimm as the menacing, villainous Tall Man. Scrimm's intimidating, menacing presence really makes the film chilling and frightening, especially where he is seen striding through Reggie's home after attempting to capture young Mike in the film's opening sequence, then again at the funeral home where he menaces Father Meyers (Kenneth Tigar); 'You think that when you die, you go to heaven! You come to US!!' (referring to the Lurkers, or zombie dwarfs). The flying silver & gold spheres are in a class by themselves, as they take on a life of their own pursuing Mike & Liz around the funeral home. Paula Irvine as Liz & Samantha Phillips as Alchemy also turn in solid performances.

This Blu-Ray is loaded with extras that make it much more interesting. Included are documentaries on the making of the film which include interviews with Don Coscarelli, Angus Scrimm, Reggie Bannister, Paula Irvine & Samantha Phillips as well as 'Wishmaster' director Robert Kurtzman (who worked on the film's effects & makeup). Also included are deleted scenes, TV spots, trailers and marketing material slideshows (posters & still photographs). Compared to the DVD release, which only contained the trailer as a special feature, the Blu-Ray is fully loaded with extras on the film. This makes it much more interesting to fans of the series.

I am more than impressed with what has been put together for this one. Phantasm fans will want to make sure they get this one!",1488758400,,2119,4.786885245901639

313285,4,6301179544,"Watched this one hot on the heels of the remastered version of the first movie. Of the five movies released thus far in the ""Phantasm"" series, this is the only one given a relatively decent budget (a little over $3m back in 1987) thanks to the fact that it was distributed by Universal Pictures...who unfortunately dumped it on the summer 1988 movie season, where the real blockbusters buried it. Don Coscarelli finally had the cash to back up his vision, however, and as such managed to make this the best-looking of the series.

""Phantasm II"" is basically a road trip movie, with our heroes Mike and Reggie tracking The Tall Man across the country in an effort to finish him off once and for all. Cue lots of action sequences, exploding houses, blood spray, long tracking shots down mausoleum hallways, and of course...flying silver balls. Despite Coscarelli's claims that it is the most straightforward and linear of all five movies, trying to figure out exactly what's going on with this surreal rollercoaster ride is missing the point. Just strap in and enjoy it!

Scream Factory have done another terrific job with the transfer and packaging. Although not quite as pristine as the newly remastered original movie, ""Phantasm II"" has a solid 1080p transfer that looks passably good on high definition TVs. It's safe to say that this is probably as good as the movie is going to look for the foreseeable future. Where this release REALLY shines is in the extra features. A number of behind the scenes documentaries are packed full of revealing tidbits, with the cast and crew members (including the late Angus Scrimm) weighing in on the shooting experience. A documentary on the special effects is particularly interesting, and shows exactly how some of the film's key sequences were put together in all their gory detail.

As with other Scream Factory releases, this is a solid, competent presentation of a classic horror movie that fans will probably want to pick up if they're upgrading from DVD to high definition. Assuming that you don't have most or any of the extras, then it's worth the price to pick this one up.",1483488000,4,2124,4.84573002754821

313402,5,6301179544,"I got sucked into Phantasm Remastered (which is great) after not seeing it for 30+ yrs and decided to check out this sequel. Never saw it when in theaters. Its a pity that Universal made them replace Mike with an up and comer. Sure he's a nice guy, but didn't really like him in other stuff I've seen with him in it either. The gratuitous sex/romance stuff adds nothing to the story and probably another Universal studio decision.

Anyways,this is still a fun sequel! I think it continues the story well and overall it was really enjoyable. Makes me want to watch the followups.

313476,4,6301179544,"While thinking what my favorite 80's horror movies are, the Phantasm series completely slipped my mind!  I forgot all about being a kid in the late 80's and being scared watching a metal ball fly through the air with sharp blades attached to it, and carving up people's foreheads.  Angus Scrimm, the talented man who plays the evil Tall Man, also supports several midgets in his sick game of being fascinated with... whatever it is he's trying to accomplish.  I probably should have watched the first Phantasm before seeing this one because I get the strong sense I missed some crucial storyline segments that would have explained the midgets, the Tall Man himself and the metal ball.  Despite not knowing for sure what's going on, Phantasm II delivers on a really good horror film.  I'd like to know if Stephen King wrote this story because it has that familiar/unusual feel to it.

Anyway the story is about two men who make it their mission to search for the Tall Man after he invades the home of one of them.  Oddly I can't figure out who the actors are in this film so I can't mention them by name to make my review more readable.  Sorry.  The scene in the beginning gives me chills.  It's when the midgets and the Tall Man invade the man's home, and basically try to take him away.  However he fights them off while sneaking around and hiding throughout his home.  You can tell this is an 80's movie because there's just that array of weirdness to it that I can't explain.  It's like Phantasm isn't quite an older movie with faded picture quality, but it's not loaded with top notch cinematography either.  That's what makes the 80's so special- the way the way horror films *look* is a major charm.

While I'm never quite sure what the story is about other than heading to the desert mountains in search of the Tall Man and finding empty graves realizing that the Tall Man has passed through (again, had to see the first Phantasm to what the Tall Man's agenda is) there's a lot to love about this movie anyway.  The acting isn't as cheesy as you'd expect, while the storyline is interesting it's probably hardly ever chilling due to the cheese factor being apparent (and also due to the writing never relying on atmosphere- small problem there) and this Tall Man's presence is always exciting because you just KNOW he's up to no good, but for a while you can't figure out why (and because I haven't watched the first movie is several decades, that movie probably explains why).  And yeah, that metal ball that flies down hallways and attacks people is just so creepy because even when the actors try to run into different rooms, that metal ball with is carving intentions has the ability to drill through doors and continue the chase!  Really creepy and Stephen King-like.

This is a slight spoiler, but when the metal ball attacks the wrong person and drills itself through this man's body, I'm not sure how the man and woman running around avoiding it could be so confident that the metal ball wasn't going to pop out of the man's ripped apart body and continue the chase!  I would have kept running seriously.  They were too confident it was over at that point.  And I LOVE the ending!  I won't spoil what happens but it's pretty creepy and a fitting way to end the movie.  Overall this is one horror movie that might leave some people thinking it's a comedy, but actually it's a pretty good horror film in its own right.  It's just a different style of horror writing than we're accustomed to.",1460332800,,3504,4.559105431309904

it also has the now defunct MCA Logo during the opening anyone who grew up in the hay day of the home video boom
will immediately remember this logo it was on almost all Universal Studio films

The PQ is pretty decent over all it's a massive step above the VHS version (It's on the same page as the original bare bones version of Phantasm II on dvd)
I'm pretty sure though the cover art was full across the front
The back has a interesting right up
Laserdisc usually had some of the most over the top film breakdown
(There is a YouTube channel  HillbillyDVDReviews)  he does LASERDISC LITERATURE:  which is very unique and fresh to say the least
I still have this LD even though i have the Collector's Edition BR/DVD Combo
I still love the cover art

Phantasm II is one of the best horror sequels of the 1980's
It mixes gore, humor and a little T&A
It's also the only Phantasm film with a massive budget MCA got behind it and gave it a national theatrical run (Unlike the original that became more a less a Grindhouse style midnight movie that found the massive cult following on VHS)
The Budget: was  $3,000,000  and it's insane they got so much out of $3,000.000

And lets face it, the effects are way better.  On the other hand, Coscerelli had to choose between using A michael Baldwin & Regie Bannister in the film.  Universal Studios wouldn't let him do his usual surrealistic style in this one.  And The Studio Crimped his style.
  But overall the movie isn't bad.  It's an enjoyable watch.  And Shout!/Scream! Factory did a great job of the transfer.  And the extras were great!",1426032000,7,586,4.538461538461538

313673,3,6301179544,"Bombing at the box office in 1988 (probably because it's nigh incomprehensible), ""Phantasm II"" is the sequel to the 1979 original. The protagonist is 19 year-old Mike (James Le Gros), who's released from a metal hospital and immediately teams-up with middle-aged Reg (Reggie Bannister) to hunt down the mysterious Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), an otherworldly mortician who plunders whole graveyards, as well as the sleeping, with the help of hideous little gnomes and baseball-sized spheres that can saw into people (?). What does the Tall Man do with the bodies and people? I think he turns them into more diabolical gnomes. Who knows? Paula Irvine and Samantha Phillips are also on hand as Liz and Alchemy.

While this is a unique, colorful and fairly entertaining horror flick, it's hampered by an incoherent story, cardboard characters, a low-budget cartoony delivery and a dubious cast. One example of the ""cardboard characters"" is Reggie, whose house and family are blown to bits and yet he gets over it immediately with zero signs of grief. Despite this, it's hard not to like Reggie and root for him & Mike as they go on the road in search of the Tall Man; they're unlikely, but amiable protagonists.

Really, everything about this film is bizarre; I've never seen anything else like it. Even the casting's bizarre. For instance, the villain is played by some tall, skinny old guy who lacks the charisma of, say, Christopher Lee to be fully effective. It's the same thing with the girls. They're not bad, but they're hardly ""Friday Girl"" material, but - then again - this may not be a bad thing because they reflect real people rather than actors with Hollywood good-looks.

As noted above, the story - or the way it's told - is nigh incomprehensible. There's a lot of action and things to perk your attention every five minutes, but everything's just so muddled, gaudy and comic booky, which may be part of the movie's charm. I can say this: it's likable.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area.

The second installment takes the characters out of the hazy nightmare world of the first and thrusts them into a crisis of the real world - an evil systematically consuming small towns.  What was uncertain in the original film is made concrete here.  Moreover, the heroes of Phantasm are now on the offensive, pursuing the Tall Man and his minions across the Northwest.  Of the four movies in the series (so far), this is the most action oriented.  The third movie, though similar to the second, is the most comedic of the three.  Finally, the fourth in the series loops back to the mysticism and surrealism of the first.  I can hardly wait for the fifth installment in 2015!",1419292800,,803,4.685714285714286

One night i could not sleep and figured why not give this a shot,so i watched it and was instantly in need of the first movie. I think the story is incredibly interesting. The characters are right on for a 80s movie. The gore is cool to me,it's the oldschool before CGI and i just can't get enough. I accidentally came across one of my favorite movie series(Phantasm 1-4)  Since seeing this i grabbed the first one,then the 3rd one and just paid 35$ for the 4th one on amazon yesterday. These movies are cool if you have never seen em before,or if you have seen number 1 then this story you will enjoy. It goes deeper into the story,explaining a bit more where the tall man is from and what his plan is. The lead character Mike is growing up and out of the hospital to go after the tall man and come across a girl he dream about to somehow protect her from the tall man. They all seem to have something to do with the tall man,the girl that Reggie picks up hitchhiking i honestly can say i saw that coming as soon as i saw them pick her up. This movie is great,the kills are always cool. Weather it's from the tall man,the gremlin things or the orbs this movie kills.
I would suggest pickign these ALL up if you can find them. They are a unique staple in American Horror and these movies will be lost in time if people don't keep them playing showing them to friends. I'm telling you this movie series is great. My personal favorite movies of the series is #2 & #3 because they just have that 80s feel to em that i love,and grew up watching. As a kid born in 1990 i'm telling you this is oldschool and it kills. I say go get it and enjoy.",1402012800,,1855,4.181564245810056

313874,4,6301179544,"This is one of the more interesting horror movies I saw as a kid.  It was scary to me when I saw it and it was also very odd.  It was made in 1988 and it looks and seems very cheesy, but I think its still interesting to watch, it reminded me of Evil Dead or Army of Darkness.  Maybe that's why I liked it, because it has the same spirit as those movies.

The movie is a sequel to the first Phantasm where all of the characters are introduced.  The most important character is the Tall Man, a tall elderly looking man who runs a local funeral home.  He has super strength and can also give other people visions, often by influencing their dreams.  Throughout the movie the characters are haunted by him, they always fear or sense his presence is close, he is the ultimate figure of death through a fatherly figure.

The basic plot is that the main characters, Mike and Reggie, team up to go eliminate the Tall Man.  There's a cool scene where they are in a gun store and they put together their weapons to take down the Tall Man and his evil minions.  One of them puts together a flame thrower and the other builds a four-barrel shotgun; any gun enthusiast will go nuts seeing it.

The Tall Man and his gang hangout at the local funeral home, which was shown in the first movie, and offers even more mystery this time around.  From the outside, the home looks like a typical 2 story house, maybe 5 or 6 rooms at most.  However, when the characters go inside(to find a missing girl), the place is made to look huge: they race down long hallways, there's like 100 rooms, a huge basement and doors that go into other dimensions.

I won't say much else, but the end scene in the funeral home is great.  If your into horror or 80s flicks, then I would say you'll be into this one.  If you've seen any of the Phantasms before, I think this is the best one, its almost like a remake of the first, done more effectively.  I recommend.",1389657600,,1925,4.2445054945054945

As for the story line, this movie pretty much requires you to have viewed the original Phantasm movie in order for you to really appreciate watching this one.  This movie literally picks up pretty much right where its prequel left off, without much background info for new-to-the-series viewers to go on.
This is sort of a comical action/horror movie.  Definitely keep in mind the word 'comical'. This movie is meant to be laughed at and not taken all-too seriously.  It is a fun movie to watch and overall, I rather liked it. Honestly, I had a hard time deciding whether to give this movie a 3-star or a 4-star rating.",1388016000,,780,4.630434782608695

If you you are wondering why you can't find Phantasm I it is because it was released in most places as The Never Dead. You don't need to see it as this film neatly summarises the first film in the opening few minutes.
This is a highly entertaining film for those that enjoy their horror with a laugh and a scare and absurdity. C'mon who isn't impressed by a 4 barrelled shotgun and a chainsaw  sword fight.

313935,5,6301179544,"The second and possibly best entry in the franchise, PHANTASM II is one of those rare sequels that is even better than the original. These films are unique in the horror genre, groundbreaking achievements in storytelling compared to it's competition from the time they were made through the present day. The film plays out like an unsettling dream, haunting and compelling at the same time. Predating the CGI FX of modern film making, everything you see was done in the real world, and they still look amazing and believable.
I have always been of the opinion that not enough films have good cemetery scenes, and on that note, this is hands down the best cemetery film I've ever seen. Most of the film takes place in a cemetery and mausoleum to truly creepy effect. Don Coscarelli's script makes bold leaps to bring us disturbing ideas and images without feeling the need to explain much of anything. And yet, it has a smooth flow that leaves you with a very entertaining viewing experience that leaves you wanting more. Luckily, there are two more entries in this series.
Perhaps the greatest strength of the film is in masterful inclusion of flashbacks to the first film, expanding on the storyline from the end of the original and tweaking the details to set up this sequel. You can totally watch this film without ever seeing the first, but I recommend watching them all. If you like horror films with more than the typical killer in a mask storyline, you owe it to yourself to check out these films.
The DVD is sadly lacking in special features. Parts I, III, and IV all have commentary tracks, behind the scenes features, and other little extras. As my favorite film in the series, I would love to hear from the actors and writer/director about all the experiences they had in creating and filming this movie.

313953,5,6301179544,"This film is fantastic and possibly the best in the franchise (though all 4 had their charms). Phantasm is a surreal experience about three friends (Mike, Reggie, Jody) who investigate local disappearances connected to The Tall Man. Angus Scrimm plays the alien who destroys towns and plunders graveyards. Phantasm II picks up where the first left off and introduces Liz into the story. It is more linear and less surreal than the original. Phantasm II is the ""big-budget"" Phantasm and is easily the slickest and best looking. Phantasm was never popular with mainstream audiences who disliked the disjointed and dreamlike qualities so it remains an underground cult favorite. They replaced Michael Baldwin in favor of James Le Gros here (he looks more like Brad Pitt than Baldwin but he has great chemistry with his co-stars and does a terrific job). There is over 90 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary.

Special Features:
Audio Commentary -- Director Don Coscarelli is joined by actors Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm.
The Ball is Back (HD, 47 min) -- Recent interviews of Don Coscarelli, Angus Scrimm, Reggie Bannister, Paula Irvine, Samantha Phillips and others.
The Gory Days (HD, 22 min) -- Interview with make-up effects specialist Greg Nicotero.
Short Film (SD, 19 min) -- Tall Man turned Abraham Lincoln by Rory Guy (aka Angus Scrimm).
Workprint Scenes (SD, 19 min) -- Alternate, extended and deleted scenes.
Deleted Scenes (HD) -- Restored from Coscarelli's collection of archival 35mm elements.
Behind-the-Scenes (1080i/60; 18 Minutes) -- Two shorter featurettes about makeup and effects.
Still Gallery (HD)
Trailers (HD, 1080i/60, SD) -- Three theatrical previews are joined by three TV spots.

Buy this Blu-Ray! It is the best version of Phantasm II available. The 2009 DVD was a no-frills release. My only complaint is James Le Gros was not involved in the bonus supplements filmed for this release. Where is the Region 2 five-disc, 4-film Phantasm Sphere: The Complete Collection (2003 DVD Box Set)? The original film remains a classic but hasn't aged as well as the sequel. Phantasm III is a major step down but it did have its moments. Phantasm IV works as a minimalist capstone for the quadrilogy (it is more loyal to the Phantasm universe than the third installment).",1376697600,3,2301,5.10079575596817

Phantasm II is a great movie, but it is not as scary as some of the other movies I have seen.

Phantasm II is a great movie and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, but not as scary as Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th.",1375920000,,626,3.859375

The things I love most about this movie is it goes so far beyond the original in scope and really opens the story up.  It becomes a really cool road picture in a way with great visuals and no short supply of inventive ideas.

There were a lot of really great horror films during the '80s such as The Thing, Evil Dead I & II, Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead, A Nightmare on Elm Street (just to name a few), but to me Phantasm II is as good as anything else that came out during the era or any other era for that matter.

This is just a fun movie that breezes along without ever a dull moment.  It was surprising to learn that Don Coscarelli accomplished everything with just a 3 million dollar budget because it definitely looks much bigger.  They blow up two different houses in the film, but you'll have to view the supplementary materials to learn how they did it (Hint: They actually only blew up one house for real).

Anyway, the Blu Ray itself looks great.  I watched it right after receiving it, and then watched it two more times again despite having seen this film 10 times already.  Don Coscarelli definitely knows how to make entertaining movies that look much bigger than their budgets.  If you're not familiar with his work, you should especially check out the original Phantasm along with Beastmaster and Bubba Ho Tep with Bruce Campbell.",1374364800,,1544,4.462633451957295

Mike (some years later) is in psychiatry treatment since no one believes his story about the ""Tall Man"" .  He learns how to be released from care so he can go home and continue his search for the formidable ""Tall Man"" and to stop him from trying to take over town by town.  His friend Reggie (Reggie Banister) is on the outside waiting for him to be released ready to back Mike up.

314024,4,6301179544,"""Phantasm II"" is one of the best representations of the Hollywood horror movie boom of the 1980s. After years of genre filmmakers scrambling for cash to get their productions up and running, many studios were looking to cash in on the terror craze. Universal chose to throw money at ""Phantasm"" and give it the opportunity to go bigger and better.

""Phantasm II"" picks up immediately after the first film. Mike convinces Reggie they must track down the Tall Man before he and his minions kill everyone in their path. The two go on the road, traveling one dead town to the next while following a trail of unearthed graveyards.

Director Don Coscarelli did what any filmmaker would do in his position. He took the studio's money and ran with it. ""Phantasm II"" is a horror spectacle to be seen. He ups the ante on everything. There are huge explosions, more mechanical flying balls, and things get visually existential to the point of confusion. It's not a bad type of disorientation. It reminds me of a terrifying version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and other films that don't fully explain what's going on.

""Phantasm II"" will make viewers fear not only how they might die, but what could happen to their bodies and souls after wards. What could be worse than being conscience in your body but not have control over yourself? Thankfully, my beliefs give me a level of comfort the Tall Man would tell you is foolish and false.

The high-definition audio and video transfers for ""Phantasm II"" will make fans of the series happy. The picture is clean and we're given a choice between a 5.1 surround sound and 2.0 stereo mix. Both guarantee a good experience with plenty of sound effects that blend well with the dialogue and musical score.

Shout! Factory provides all sorts of special features just the way we've come to expect. Audio commentary is supplied by director Don Coscarelli and actors Angus Scrimm and Reggie Bannister. We also get new in-depth interviews with Coscarelli, Scrimm, Bannister, and Paula Irvine. There are also plenty of featurettes on the production of the film and the special effects. Trailers, TV spots, work print scenes, and deleted scenes round out the bonus material.

""Phantasm II"" serves as a nostalgic look back at a special era in the history of horror films. It was a time where practical effects still ruled and green screen didn't dominate every frame. Great gore and a truly creepy storyline make this a welcome addition to any genre fan's home movie collection.",1365638400,3,2498,4.811188811188811

314026,5,6301179544,"Many people were first introduced to the tall man by this film.  This ran pretty regularly on television back in the late 80's into the early 90's.  This may not be your favorite of the Phantasm's.  I prefer the original...but that being said this has so many extras in it that it is hard to not prefer it until they do the original on blu ray.  The first film was more mystery sci fi and this is a much more direct action horror film.  The extras include 47 minutes of Don, Angus, Reggie and most folks in the film.  It also has commentary from those first three on this.  It also has a 17 minute special called gory days just dealing with the gore effects.  To top it all off the tall man included a film from his collection where he plays Abraham Lincoln.  The only person missing from the extras seems to be Michael's replacement James LeGros.  Whether he refused or was not asked to do anything with the extras I don't know.  Michael Baldwin of course is in all the other films and James got this role mainly because he was a bigger name and Michael didn't act really after the first film so the studio said they had to have a working actor.

The film itself is of good quality.  I don't think they could really get the print to look much better.  It does have some artifacts and things with the black levels but that is minor nit picking at what so far is the best looking of all four films due to the blu ray release.

The sound is in 5.1 but you won't notice too much use of the back speakers.  The spheres do fly left to right or vice versa in the speakers but weren't as pronounced as I expected.  Still the sound was very adequate and I had no issues with it.

Overall this is a great addition to a horror collection.  Shout Factory puts every bit of effort doing these films.  They take these things seriously and you can spend days going over the extras and listening to them all.

If you like any of the films then you will appreciate the upgrade of this one and pray that shout factory gets the others to upgrade them.",1364428800,6,2033,4.215025906735751

314074,5,6301179544,"Producing a sequel to a unique horror film like ""Phantasm"" had to have been a challenge, but somehow writer/director Don Coscarelli managed to strike gold twice. Arriving nearly ten years after its predecessor and in a decidedly different climate, ""Phantasm II"" shifts gears from the creepy, dream-like original to a unique action/horror hybrid and passes with flying colors. While the tone is noticeably different from the first, most of the elements that made the original so special are re-arranged to make something altogether different and ultimately, well, fun.

Picking up where we left off in the original, Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Mike (re-cast from Michael Baldwin to James LeGros) effectively send the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) packing. Unfortunately, after spending a number of years in a mental hospital, Mike starts having visions of his foe as well as a mysterious young girl (Paula Irvine). Together with his surrogate big brother, he goes on a cross-country quest to track down the Tall Man and defeat him once and for all.

""Phantasm II"" is a rare case of a sequel breaking away from the format of the original and succeeding in its own right. The film makes nods to horror movies of its time -- there's a bit of ""Elm Street"" and ""Evil Dead"" sprinkled throughout -- and it's remarkable how well it comes together. Coscarelli does an excellent job of keeping the pace going while balancing ambitious ideas and bizarre special effects. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, but that's part of the film's charm. Bannister is as game as always as the loveable Reggie, while LeGros steps into Baldwin's shoes effortlessly. The two have excellent chemistry together and the journey they take is every bit as fun and the frenzied finale the film offers.

From front to back, ""Phantasm II"" is good old spooky fun from the late `80s as only Coscarelli could deliver. And if that's not enough for you, there are still two more enjoyable sequels to plow through. ""Phantasm II"" is but a landmark in one of the most bizarre and unique horror series of its time.",1335139200,2,2081,4.90625

314077,5,6301179544,"Phantasm II is a seriously underrated classic. If you don't think a low budget horror sequel can rise to the level of art, then read no further. The camera work and cinematography are exquisite, with the camera always crawling, panning, or hovering menacingly. It's sort of between what you might see in a Dario Argento or Sam Raimi film.

Those who would dissect the plot are, I think, missing the point. It moves with a dream logic, and throughout, characters are never entirely sure if they are awake or asleep. The Tall Man is simply a primitive evil source who Mike and Reggie alternately hunt, or are hunted by. Along the way there are beautiful women, mutant dead dwarves, parallel dimensions, abandoned towns with empty graveyards, homemade super-weapons, malicious metallic orbs, and fantastic amounts of gore.

The visuals, while obviously dated, still hold up amazingly well. I personally find a certain charm to the old school grab-bag of make up, mechanics, and slick camera tricks. No CGI here, folks.

While the characters are cliched to a degree, the actors all bring some extra personality to their roles and there seems to be some genuine chemistry among the cast. Some diehard fans of the series dislike the fact that the original actor who played Mike was replaced by a new one, but it did not bother me. Of course, Angus Scrimm steals every scene he appears in, as the Tall Man.

My guess is, if you don't already relish this genre, this film will not convert you. But for those who like their horror topped with heaping amounts of imaginitive bloodshed (often served with chainsaws and blowtorches), this is a fun ride.",1313452800,,1641,4.829181494661921

It's one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The plot is discombobulated; the acting is mediocre; the dialogue is too weird; there isn't suspense or intrigue; and it was very boring and vapid.

314140,4,6301179544,"...Regarding the R-1 DVD release of ""P-II"" I'd forgotten that it was *FINALLY* available. However, I'd already circumvented ""Sorry-versal's"" squeezing the gonads of fans of the movie several years ago by purchasing this movie on DVD from a U.K. vendor. Upon hearing how ""Sorryversal"" continued to thumb their noses at the fans by offering a DVD release not worth celebrating, I'm feeling no driving urge to replace my U.K. edition.

I did want to share one bit of important information, however, regarding many people's disappointment with the fact that A. Michael Baldwin had not been retained to reprise his role as Mike.

For those who are laying the guilt trip at the feet of Don Coscarelli, please don't.

The decision to replace Baldwin was *NOT* Coscarelli's; he was merely giving in to the pressure placed upon him by the ""suits"" at ""Sorryversal"" (who always seem to have it in their minds that they somehow ""know better"" what the people want than do the people who are actually making and attending those movies). In order for Coscarelli to be given the final 'green light' on the project, the assho... uh... I mean, the ""suits"" at ""Sorryversal"" demanded that he eliminate one of two principle actors set to reprise their original roles -- Don C. reluctantly made the regrettable & unfortunate choice of letting Baldwin go in favor of retaining Reggie Bannister, who was undeniably the wiser choice.

I suspect ""Sorryversal"" would've made more money with this movie, and that it would've definitely been much better received, if they had allowed Coscarelli to retain both returning actors, but the jackof... uh... the ""suits"" wanted a ""name"" more than they wanted to appease the audiences who were responsible for making the original ""Phantasm"" such a cherished classic.

This movie compares to the way Evil Dead II continued it's
series. A bigger budget, a good update to the story and
new actors in the mix.
The story continues from part one and explains what happened to Michael
after he was pulled through the bedroom mirror at the end of the
first film.
Due to a new actor being played for Michael's part, the
end of part one was re-filmed to include the new actor (James Le Gros)
as well as an older Reggie (stilled played by the great Reggie Bannister).
This film was made ten years after the original so the small adjustments
were needed to continue the series.
Even without the original actor who played Michael back in 1978(Michael Baldwin)
the film still does a great job of moving on.
The real stars of the movie will always be The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) and The Spheres.
They're back both bigger and badder than the first film.
Wait till you see what the Gold Sphere can do!

314272,5,6301179544,"I have been a huge PHANTASM fan ever since I saw the original in the theater back in '79.  I loved it so much, that frankly it took me awhile to get around to seeing this first sequel, released about 9 years later.  I guess I've had a lot of disappointment with sequels over the years.  When I finally did see it on VHS maybe a year or two after its release, I was a bit let down.  They had a different actor playing Mike, and the overall feeling just wasn't the same.

That being said, I've come to appreciate this film more and more with each viewing.  Sure, it's got a different feel to it.  At times it plays more like a full-bore action movie. But the way it unfolds is essential to the storyline of the entire series, and does a great job setting up the two subsequent sequels.  For me at least, after repeated viewings, it became increasingly evident that it really is an absolutely perfect sequel to the first film.  I even came to truly enjoy and appreciate James LeGros' portrayal of Mike. Reggie Bannister is great, as he is in everything he does.  And I don't need to say anymore than has already been said at length over the years about Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man.  Pure sinister evil.

When my VHS copy finally wore out, I had to content myself with a VHS television copy (probably even edited - I don't remember).  Then one day a couple of years ago, I found out about the Anchor Bay Region 2 Silver Sphere edition with all four films on DVD, and I jumped on that, even though I had numbers 1, 3, and 4 already on Region 1.

Needless to say, I will pre-order this as soon as I finish writing this review (I'm shocked I didn't pre-order it first).  If ONLY there would someday be a PHANTASM V, but that possibility becomes more remote with each year that passes.  I just hope that Hollywood doesn't decide to remake or ""re-envision"" the first film or the series.  Not a good idea.

If you love PHANTASM, buy this DVD.  It's what U.S. Phantasm fans have been waiting for, for a long, long time...

The Tall Man is back in the sequel, and maybe better than ever. He even earned himself an early nomination for a 2009 Woody Award for best backhand. SLAP! He's got a sweet band of elves at his side. One must have been the lead singer in a ""The Reflections"" cover band because he had Sid's moves down to a T. The balls are also back in this one as fierce as ever. A big difference in the sequel was Reggie's level of awesomness. He looked like McQueen in 10 years so you know we added a star for that. However, the biggest difference between the first installment and the sequel is that the first film was more of a psychological thriller and this one was a more straight forward horror flick.

Your pal, Sid the Elf, totally dug this movie. The only thing we were on the fence about was: Is this movie B? Let's consider these three points. One, Clint Howard's fatter stunt double was in the movie. Two, It was clear that French's yellow mustard was spurting from The Tall Man's head after he was struck by a ball. And three, the ending was very abrupt, a telltale sign of B.

314359,5,6301179544,"The events of the first movie are a blur in the mind of Mike, who now finds himself being released from a mental ward after his initial run-in with The Tall Man. Enter Reggie, beloved Ice Cream Truck Driver and survivor with holes in his memory, and things seem to be coming back into place. The only problem is that Mike wasn't made, that The Tall Man is still moving from town to own, and graveyards are still emptying.
Everything keeps on keeping on - and then some.

So, what is The Tall Man? Nobody really knows. He appears and then people begin to die, and the cemeteries begin to fill. The bodies then start to vanish, and ""things"" begin to take their place. This is explored more in the 2nd movie, but the answers only bring about more questions.
It's kinda beautiful in a strange sort of way, too.

While the first Phantasm is the one people really remember, the 2nd is really the one that took Phantasm to a new level by introducing it to special effects and to some rather frightening scenes. Anyone that has seen the movie will recall ""the back worm"" calling card that The Tall Man leaves behind, and anyone that has seen any of the other movies certainly remembers the flying pool balls. The one thing that this movie adds is gore, lots of gore, and a story that is just as vague (and somehow fulfilling) as the first one.

When you look at the movies, none of them really stick into any order and, in this one, ou certainly have some interesting problems that come with sequels. I personally found a few of the angles fun (and somewhat interesting) when they were approached, and I liked some of the things they did with Mike. In the first movie they tormented him to the point that it seemed like death would be kind. In the second the movie finds itself pressing onward and upward, taking anything that connects our two characters to ""the real world"" and using that against them.

While there are a lot of people that do not like this movie, I saw it years ago and have always had it on my mind. Sadly it is the only one of the series to not make it onto DVD, but that doesn't really speak on the quality of the movie.
Like any of the Phantasm movies, they are acquired tastes so I can't say ""it is for everyone."" Still, what is?",1186790400,,2245,4.338095238095238

I know I'm definitely not alone in saying that, and for a horror movie series, that may sound strange. But, if you are like me, then you understand 100% what I mean. There's just something intangable that attracts me to Phantasm. It reminds me of staying up past midnight on Saturday nights as a kid, in the dark, with just the t.v. on. It was a treat. Phantasm 2 has fantasy, horror, gore, action, graveyards, flying spheres that protrude cutting devices to slice your ear off, undead, and a fantastic villian is is always pursuing the hero, Michael. Phantasm is a cult franchise. It a must see for all horror fans.",1184544000,,717,4.523076923076923

314364,5,6301179544,"When I was younger I saw Phantasm one night on T.V. when I was flipping channels. You know, one of those nights when it's late, it's the weekend, you feel good, and you're all alone and all you want is to see a movie that makes an impact on your life somehow. Phantasm IS one of those movies. It is, to me, the impidimy of what a horror movie should be. Graveyards, darkness, fog, monsters, evil powers, zombies that are actually scary, and a sweet 1971 Hemi-Cuda. The ""ball"" is the most revolutionary idea to come to horror movies. I was so excited after seeieng it I went to the video store and to my sheer pleasure, there was part 1,2, and 3. Each one takes up from where the last one ended. I absolutely LOVE the Phantasm series more than any other series.

I feel as if the series was taylor made for me. It touches a primal fear in me that is both scary and exhilerating. The Tall Man is so cool !! The flying ball(s) and the sound they make is Phantastic !!

I couldn't care less who owns the copywrite to the series. Yes, I adore Mike and would've loved to see him in part 2, but, dammit, I want the BOX SET !!!!!!!! I know I speak for other fans.

Quite simply, the Phantasm series holds a very special place in my heart. It is what movie making should be.

Don, if you are reading this, thank you so much for bringing joy into my life. I'm sure you aware by now that you have quite a cult following !!",1165708800,15,1411,4.12
314365,4,6301179544,"I took off one star for a few reasons.

I didn't even understand when I first watched this movie that the one guy is supposed to be Mike from Phantasm 1.  In fact I'm still not sure if it is.

The plot is hard to follow.  Reggie blows up Mike's house at the beginning but I guess that was only one of Mike's nightmares at the insane asylum.  In reality it is Reggie's house that gets blown up later with his family.

Without watching part 1 I don't see how anyone could comprehend this movie.

Everyone in the movie seems to already know more or less what the Tall Man is going to do.  I guess this is necessarily so because they found out in part 1.  But the great thing about part 1 was nobody even knew about the Tall Man at the beginning.  It was the mystery and gradual discovery that made part 1 so tremendous.

There's a lot of symbolism in this movie related to religion.

The priest character has some weaknesses but he does save the lovely heroine.  (You always need someone with a wide forehead in these movies.)

To me there are many hidden meanings in the Phantasm movies.

This is the sequel to probably the greatest horror film of all time.

Even a Phantasm movie that isn't perfect is far above most other horror films.

I hope they release that box set in the U.S. I will buy it.

314366,5,6301179544,"I love this series I gave this Film 5 stars. The reason thIS is Crap is because Phantasm 2 is NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD. Why? I have no Idea. The UK Region 2 has all four films on DVD and a Cool DVD Box Set it the shape of a BALL. They say the reason for the two not being on DVD  had to do with Copyright issues but, that makes no sense because you would think if there were Copyright problems they wouldn't be for sale in the UK. I think The Rights to all four movies should go to Don (THE REAL MASTER OF HORROR). Phantasm one, three and four belong to MGM part two belongs to UNIVERSAL. I don't think Don shoud've let them produce part 2 because they wouldn't let him cast Mike Bladwin to reprize the role that made him a star. I'm glade that there are squals (sp) but, Phantasm was intended to be a stand alone film.

314367,5,6301179544,"Don Coscarelli demonstrated his talent in first ""Phantasm"" and now he was granted a bigger budget by Universal Pictures. And extra money appeared to be quite useful. We got the same grim and atmosperic movie but with better special effects and more advanced technically. Money allowed to build beautiful and extended interiors, make the picture spellbinding, increase the number of killing spheres and expand the cast - therefore we got to see wonderful actors here like James LeGros as Mike and Kenneth Tigar as a charismatic priest.
And although ""Phantasm II"" has a bigger calibre than the previous one it is still very atmospheric and claustrophobic. If the first was more of a little mystic film, the second grew up to be an action horror road-movie. And it served him good. As Don Coscarelli mentioned in his commentary track, you may like this film or not, but you will not deny the fact it's a film of great imagery. It is picturesque indeed. There are plenty scenes you can get pleasure watching, even if you had watched them separately, not in chronological order, not knowing the plot. ""Phantasm II"" is just beautiful. And it's not that slowly-paced as other ""Phantasm"" series, it's much more active and intense.
This film of great imagination is one of my all-time favourites. I just bought the British 5-disc sphere edition. Guess soon it'll be released in America too.",1133222400,10,1381,4.905982905982906
314388,5,6301179544,"PHANTASM 2, like the original, is a brilliant film for several reasons. Its chief strength, however, lay in its script. On one level, it utilizes classic horror movie elements: nightmares, grave robbers, the haunting mausoleum and cemetery, the menacing man who watches over everything, etc. But then it incorporates that with classic sci-fi elements: reanimation, the alien race conquering humans, transports into other dimensions, etc. Unlike the original, this film is tempered by a sweet but not saccharine love story and a good smattering of humor.  All this, which could have been muddled by someone else is deftly directed with low budget (but very effective special effects) by Don Coscarelli.",1090886400,9,701,5.372727272727273
314389,5,6301179544,"Phantasm II (1988). Rated ""R"". Running Time: One hour, 37 mins.
Directed and written by Don Coscarelli.
Produced by Dac Coscarelli, Robert Del Valle, Roberto A. Quezada.
This second Phantasm begins where the first film, PHANTASM (1979), left off and takes you seven years later.  In real time it was nine years before they finally made this sequel.  That is why everyone looks more mature.  James Le Gros takes over as ""Michael"" for this film only.  But A. Michael Baldwin can be seen in flashbacks.  Reggie Bannister and the Tall Man Angus Scrimm are back and so are those deadly silver spheres.  I'll keep the plot a surprise for you, but this sequel is more big-budget.  They go all out for this one and is very enjoyable if you like suspense, horror and more gore.

Filmed in San Fernando Valley, Long Beach, Santa Paula, Valencia, Chatsworth, Hawthorne, Highland Park, Los Angeles, California.

Funny sex scene.
  If James Le Gros looks familiar, twelve years later after this film, he had a regular role in the tv series ""Ally McBeal"" in 2000-2001.

Phantasm 2 picks up the story ten years after the 'events' of the first film (this being made in 1988, ten years after Phantasm 1) with an overlapping prelude and some catch up with the surviving characters. Quickly the movie settles into the chase thriller format, with Reggie and Mike's hunt uncovering town after town destroyed by the Tall Man. Writer/director Don Coscarelli both retells the story and expands the scope of the first film, but the results, while certainly atmospheric, are mixed. In the end P2 is nothing more than a stylish, more plot focused retread, rather than expansion, of the Phantasm mythos.

314392,2,6301179544,"This had the potential to be one of the truly great horror sequels of the 80's. In a decade of Halloween inspired ""slasher flicks"" the Phantasm franchise had a golden opportunity to show its' originality. However such is not the case... well not quite. Phantasm 2 did return to the screen the vision of a true auteur of the genre Don Coscarelli, but his vision is badly flawed this time around. This, I'm sure, is due in no small part to his affiliation with the studios. His ground breaking original was done independently and so he had the final say on the production. Unfortunately Universal forced him to explain every nuance of the film so you always know whether it's a ""dream"" sequence or not, and for those not sure that's a bad thing. Infact that was the key to the originals genius. Not that it realy matters this movie still lacks coherence. On top of that is the fact Coscarelli does very little to continue the story, unless you consider a few more apparatuses for the flying spheres to slice and dice with a continuation. He does have his endeavors, though they tend not to please. One such example is the inclusion of Liz and Alchemy. They have no real purpose in the film besides serving as faces to talk to and,concerning Alchemy, Reggies labido. The movie does benefit from beautiful photography, creative direction, and fine acting from the likes of Reggie Bannister and of course Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man. Also Phantasm 2, along with Halloween 2, features amazing continuity in it's opening sequence, with the original Phantasm scenes interjected seamlessly. Even title music is a slight improvement over the original. Despite these developments Phantasm 2 is still lacking. Coscarelli shows us more, and with less cash, in Phantasm 3: Lord of the Dead. In the beggining of that film the director shows the Tall Man stepping through the dimensional forks to dicard of his own body! He also rudely kills off Liz showing she has no place of importence in the Phantasm saga. Phantasm 2 does utilize it's bigger budget (you can't realy call 2 million dollars immense though) to fill the screen with an aray of dazzling efects, unique props, and well staged stunts. To bad they forgot about the story.",1001203200,8,2220,4.753886010362694
314393,2,6301179544,"While the original ""Phantasm"" wasn't one of my favorite horror films, it did have some good, low-budget shocks and quirks.  Now comes ""Phantasm II,"" a more expensive but just as plotless exercise following the exploits of the wonderfully malevolent Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), who truly deserves his own franchise.  Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Mike (a miscast James LeGros) spend half the movie traveling cross-country in search of their adversary, finally tracking him down in the familiar morgue setting.
""Phantasm II"" doesn't improve on its predecessor as far as coherence goes, and the first half of the film might lull you into a stupor, but the final act is (surprisingly) exciting and original.  Writer-director Don Coscarelli wisely gives the Tall Man more screen time, and puts some new twists on the murderous flying sphere.  Good scenes include a chainsaw duel, a priest getting strangled by a crucifix on a chain, and a sphere turning one of the Tall Man's minions into hamburger.
However, despite a solid third act, the only people likely to enjoy this film are those who were ballistic over the original ""Phantasm.""",999302400,5,1128,5.114130434782608

314438,5,6301179544,"Phantasm II (1988)
Phantasm II is the sequel to the 1979 horror  classic,Phantasm. If you ask me,it's just as good as Phantasm,if not  better.
The story is simple. Michael Pearson (James LeGros) talks his  doctors into freeing him from a mental hospital. Michael has been in a  mental hospital for quite some time,due to his crazy story about the events  from Phantasm (the hooded midget monks, flying spheres,etc).Michael  convinces them that those were just leftover nightmares.
The doctors  foolishly believe Michael and let hime free. He  contacts his long-time  friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) into  stopping the sinister mortician  known as ""The Tall Man"" (Angus Scrimm).""The Tall Man""  is a very tall mortician who is strong enough to lift up a casket and  multiple people. He targets a beautiful young girl named Liz (Paula  Irvine),who Michael & Reggie intend to rescue then destroy ""The  Tall Man"".
This time their not un-prepared. Michael & Reggie  break into an  abandoned hardware store and take some powerful weapons in  the  process. Makeshift flamethrowers,quadrulple-barreled shotguns,  chainsaws,power drills,and various other weapons are used as Michael &  Reggie hunt down ""The Tall Man"".
The special effects are  excellent (the finale is very cool), the story great,the acting wonderful  (Angus Scrimm is brilliant as ""The Tall Man""),and the film a  thrill ride from start to  finish. Phantasm II is in my opinion the best of  the entire Phantasm series. I would highly suggest you buy it now. It's one  of the most entertaining,engrossing,scariest movies your bound to see. An  underrated classic (besides it's predecessor).",965865600,8,1647,5.328125
314439,4,6301179544,"To give a cheesy-yet-kickass horror movie a 5-star rating is a little over-the-top, but none the less I really love this one!
So the plot is a little thin, so the acting is marginal, so the story's predictable...so  WHAT!  Don't be expecting the inspiration for ""Saving Private  Ryan"" here!  And most of all, WHO SAYS HORROR MOVIE SEQUELS SUCK?  ""Phantasm II"" is 20 times better than the first one!  This one  has so much more action, cool weapons, hot babes, and gross effects!  That's probably the highlight, actually...the gross effects caused by the  cool weapons.  What can possibly be better than watching Reggie kill 4  mutant dwarves with one thunderous blast of his wickedly insane 4-barreled  shotgun!  I can't think of anything more fun to watch on a friday night  than Roller Derby on TNN! Ok, I can.
""Phantasm II"" is not  only the most underrated horror movie ever, but it's my personal favorite  horror movie ever!  (Besides ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of  Darkness"" but those are so funny I can't call them horror and keep a  straight face.)  ""Phantasm II"" is a lover or a hater, depending  on what you like.  I love a good horror movie where the good guys kick the  bejesus out of the dastardly villain, and Tall Man is definitely dastardly.  Dastardly enough to make 3 more sequels (or was it 2?) At any rate, don't  bother with those (as you could've guessed.) This second installment is by  FAR the best of the series and at the price amazon is currently selling it  at, think about it: you have NOTHING to lose!
