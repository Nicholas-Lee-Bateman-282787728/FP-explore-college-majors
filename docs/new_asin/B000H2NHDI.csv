The entertainment factor is great, you laugh at Bob Hope and his on-stage humor with the actresses, and cry while watching the hospital visits.  It makes you realize what a great man Bob Hope was, compassionate and caring, and willing to put his life in danger for the troops.  The video is actually shorter than what is stated in the introduction.  My guess is that some things were left out, possbibly due to copyright restrictions.",1236556800,,608,4.532110091743119
