Not only do you get the entire series, but you also get the first episode of Ultraman, the first 2 episodes of Spectreman, and the Johnny Sokko movie Voyage Into Space. None of which are included in the Shout! Factory version.",1366416000,,338,4.467741935483871
8390120,3,B0036Q2RQK,"I love this classic series. Bring me back to my childhood. The video quality is fair at best and the DVD are the home made style, burned DVD-R. I doubt that this is a legal edition. Bumber.",1288396800,13,189,4.135135135135135
8390121,1,B0036Q2RQK,The first copy that I recieved was smashed during shipping and had 2 disc #6 and no disc #7 and was very poor quality. This is not an oficial release.,1283472000,22,150,4.033333333333333
8390122,1,B0036Q2RQK,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY!!!!
There are rumors on the internet that MGM has quietly ended its DVD-r program. This was the way that MGM was going to release Johnny Sokko. So, I decided to buy this release, what a mistake. Copied from sub-standard vcr tapes, with video glitches and drop outs. Quality looks like LP speed tapes. The 8th disc, ""Voyage in Space"" has a Toshiba dvd recorder menu. This is obviously a bootleg, and on dvd-r's, which Amazon fails to mention. There are better source prints available. I will be sending mine back, immediately!!!",1281916800,44,547,4.768421052631579
