8204559,1,B000S6LS98,"These people leaving good reviews are lying. This film was so bad that I rushed to go trade it in the next morning at best buy's dvd trade-in for select blu-ray's sale. I understand the meaning on the film and what happened, but there are still alotta holes. And what is up with the stupid snakes. This movie is so low budget too. I could go on and on.....",1318896000,,356,4.173913043478261
8204560,1,B000S6LS98,"For those of you looking to spend your money on a good movie, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!  The first part of the movie was interesting, but then it was all downhill from there.  There is a voodoo premise that was poorly done.  Some research would have been helpful, and might have helped the ending make more sense.  The plot was extremely predictable.  The ""surprise"" ending was lame to say the least.  The acting was halfway decent, but it couldn't save the movie.  There are vague flashbacks throughout the movie that are supposed to tie everything together, but it holds like thin spaghetti.  Bottom line is just nail this one in its coffin and bury it quickly!!!",1227744000,6,661,4.637931034482759
8204561,4,B000S6LS98,"I originally bought this movie because of the RENT-head in me saying: ""Wilson!""  But I thought that would be the only good thing about it.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be.  All three of the actors did a great job, especially for filming the whole thing in about eight days.  Of course, the RENT-head is still preferential to the scenes with Wilson in them... he's so creepy in this movie, he makes you squirm in uncomfortableness.  Surprising to think Angel could ever make someone feel anything but happy.  Overall, well made independent film, good acting, interesting story, out-of-the-box, and Wilson.",1219795200,,620,4.857142857142857
8204562,1,B000S6LS98,A perfect example of how a DVD cover can seduce the viewer...what a disappointment!!!Let's hope SAW IV DVD is better than this excuse for a horror flick.,1200182400,3,153,4.703703703703703
8204563,3,B000S6LS98,"This movie was alot better then what I thought it would be. I usually don't watch horror movies with a majority black cast because they usually suck,but this one was good...",1196380800,8,173,4.612903225806452
8204564,5,B000S6LS98,"Having watched horror movies for over 40 years it's hard to find a new wrinkle. This film however does just that. The acting is actually quite good and the cast does a good job in selling the story. Mr Porter gives a frightfully convincing performance and pulls you in so that you can practically feel the fear. The story is well written and not the same old plot that's just retreaded with only a few changes. If you give this movie a chance it will grab you and pull you in before you know it and you will find yourself on the edge of your seat. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a real horror story, the kind until now I didn't think they made anymore. I look forward to seeing more movies like this and hope to see alot more of Charles Porter in front of the camera in the future.",1189728000,14,792,4.14935064935065
