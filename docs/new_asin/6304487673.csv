888121,5,6304487673,My second favorite Jackie Chan film next to Fearless Hyena. The action is non-stop and goofy. In case anybody is wondering this works on American Bluray players along with any American ps3 and ps4. This release also includes English subtitles which is nice.,1419552000,,257,5.0
888122,1,6304487673,"I got the item on time but it didn't work! I e-mailed the seller and he sent me another one  free. It didn't work as well. So to make sure it wasn't me, I let my brother try them on his dvd player and he said they didn't work either! I hate giving bad reviews but this dvd does not work.",1284249600,,287,3.7049180327868854
888123,4,6304487673,"THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT REALLY SHOWCASES JACKIE CHAN'S INCREDIBLE MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS. IN THIS ONE, A MAN NAMED TIGER GETS INJURED AND DRAGON [JACKIE CHAN], HIS BROTHER, IS CHOSEN TO REPLACE HIM FOR THE LION DANCE COMPETITION. HOWEVER, DRAGON DISCOVERS THAT HIS BROTHER TIGER IS THE RIVAL LION DANCER IN THE COMPETITION. SOON, TIGER CONFESSES EVERYTHING TO THE MASTER, AND WHEN HE THROWS HIM OUT, DRAGON GOES TO SEARCH FOR HIS BROTHER. VERY EXCITING, AND IT'S ALSO FUNNY. ANY FAN OF JACKIE CHAN SHOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE. THE LAST FIGHT OF THE FILM IS VERY FUN TO WATCH AND IT SHOWS JUST HOW GOOD JACKIE CHAN ALWAYS WAS. A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES JACKIE CHAN.",1059436800,,657,4.6239316239316235
888124,3,6304487673,"It's almost funny.  Jackie Chan in the late 1970's, early '80s.  No stunts that mark his later career, this all about straight fighting at slow pace, one in which you notice the plotting and plans.  The villian here almost seems to outshine Chan in terms of fighting and martial arts.  Still, you see Chan's Buster Keaton-like humor develop here.  It doesn't matter how bad the dubbing is, as Chan's physical mannerisms are still a joy to watch, even if it's no where near the calibre of Drunken Master 2 or Mr. Nice Guy.  If you buy this, you get a little bit of martial art's history. . .namely, seeing one of Jackie Chan's low-budget steps towards becoming a screen hero.
Granted, some of this [is not so good], but it is fun to watch a master in the early stages of his career.",995760000,,781,4.426573426573427
888125,4,6304487673,"By far one of his greatest films i have seen.  Not far behind Snake in the Eagles shadow.  The action in this one is top notch, and some good humor as well, but not corny like many of his new movies.  I could watch these types of movies all day. It's got it all, including a long, amazing final battle with some of the most impressive styles you'll see. A must have for any jackie chan fan, or i should say any martial arts fan.",972777600,2,428,4.011764705882353
888126,5,6304487673,This movie was incredible.  The dragon scene at the beginning is just plain cool.  Some of the stuff he pulls with day to day objects and such are amazing.  Also this is one of the funniest Jackie flicks in existence.,916876800,,217,4.375

888223,5,6304487673,"I saw this movie when I was a little kid without subtitles. I rented it from some small video store. I had no idea what the plot was. It didn't matter; this movie was all about the action. Watching it again now, years later, I noticed that the action sequences are much more choreographed, choppy and slower. Today's action sequences are so much faster, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.

AND... the final scene at the end is amazing! The villain's kicks, wrist locks and holds were crazy! A friend used to attend his Hapkido studio in Toronto and I met him when I visited. A nice man and very respected by all his students.",1483747200,2,630,4.294117647058823

888226,5,6304487673,One of those classic Jackie Chan kung-fu movies from the past.  Always fun to watch and those fight scenes are just eye-popping to watch!,1482710400,,137,4.708333333333333
7872765,4,6304487673,"Dubbed in English, this movie has loads of well-choreographed kung-fu fight scenes.  A nice intro at the beginning of the movie with lion dance competition.  His kung-fu brother whom Jackie Chan loves, ends up being greedy and takes a bribe to win the competition on behalf of the competitive kung-fu school (villain).  In protecting his kung-fu brother, Jackie Chan takes all the blame for losing the competition and the naked girl his brother had in the kitchen.  His master knowing Jackie's brother is a trouble maker kicks out the brother.  His brother later ends up doing another bad job of helping the competitive school break out a jail bird.  Jackie and his brother, both from the same school, each own the same fan.  Mistaken by the police to be the same person due to their ownership of the fan, the police started chasing after Jackie due to mistaken identity.  After the police finds out that they got the wrong person, Jackie was let go while getting to know the police chief.  Jackie was then able to save his brother one last time by getting the police chief to agree that if he can capture the real villain behind the jail break that his brother is off the hook for the helping with the jail break without knowing what he was getting involved with.  Not the strongest story, but better than most other kung-fu stories.",1518480000,,1334,4.662393162393163
7872766,2,6304487673,"Some of the main villain's martial arts are very good: about 15 minutes at the beginning of the main fight at the end. Otherwise, the film is terrible.",1518307200,,151,4.428571428571429
7872767,5,6304487673,"Wonderful movie and important in the history of martial arts film. At first glance it's your typical Saturday Morning chop socky from the 1970's with the stereotypical awful lip sync and English voice acting. If you can get past that, this is a very neat fast moving film with some light comedy and tons of great fights.

The interesting thing is that Young Master is Jackie Chan's first real coming out show, where he showcases his unique talent at choreographing and performing fight scenes. Most of the early fights are filmed in an extremely old school method, very rigid and formal; almost like a dance routine. But Jackie's character in the end breaks out into his own much looser and more free flowing fight style which would become his trademark. Anyone who's seen either Drunken Master movie will immediately recognize a very familiar scene - this film was Jackie's test run for that character.",1518134400,,903,4.863636363636363
7872768,5,6304487673,"Has some great humor and action, even if cheesy. Shows off Jackie's martial arts talent as well as his quirky personality. I enjoyed the extended scene in the house when he cleans himself up after his tumble into the swamp. Very entertaining movie.",1514246400,,248,4.790697674418604

Hard to believe he was ever in such incredible shape, but this movie gives the first of the Drunken Fighting he later becomes famous for doing.  If you enjoy Jackie Chan this is a MUST SEE MOVIE !!!!",1503792000,,302,4.375
