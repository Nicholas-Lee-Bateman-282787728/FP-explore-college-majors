8608658,4,B00ERH12V8,It was a cool little piece on a really rad band from down under.,1464912000,,64,3.642857142857143
8608659,5,B00ERH12V8,"Band members commentary, footage new and old, licensed music, humor and solid production are, to me, essential to any music documentary. This has 'em all and then some.",1461110400,,168,5.035714285714286
8608660,5,B00ERH12V8,"This is one of the most amazing rock documentarys Channel 83 has ever seen. It is worth having Amazon Prime just to have access to this film, which most likely isn't widely available outside of Australia. When I was living in Australia in 1989, I had been told about the Cosmic Psychos as a punk band I should listen to. Like many others it seems, I didn't take that tip seriously because I thought the Cosmic part of the name sounded crook. Turns out I not only missed some of the best music of the period but also missed out on what influenced a great deal of the Seattle Grunge scene a couple of years later. Even if you are not tuned in to the music, the story behind these guys is effing fascinating. Must see!",1456099200,,715,4.264705882352941
8608661,4,B00ERH12V8,"If you enjoy rockumentaries, this is great fun. Not for kids. Several grunge luminaries make appearances. I found it inspiring, in a ""do what you want"" kind of way.",1439510400,,164,4.689655172413793
8608662,4,B00ERH12V8,"I was lucky enough to watch this doc at the Empty Bottle in Chicago with the blokes you can trust sitting right behind me at the bar. This is a genuinely moving film, at times hilarious and at times heartbreaking, but always compelling.",1427500800,,236,4.511627906976744
8608663,5,B00ERH12V8,Fans of the band will enjoy this for the backstory and interviews.,1426982400,,66,4.583333333333333
8608664,5,B00ERH12V8,"This is an amazing documentary about a band that does not get the props they should on the best of lists and influences.  Great turns by Eddie Vedder if you don't  like the part about the coin game and Eddie, you are not a fan of rock n roll!  Get it now!",1405555200,2,255,3.8653846153846154
8608665,4,B00ERH12V8,"It probably helps if you're already a Cosmic Psychos fan, but the documentary is engaging and well done. Follows their career from the start until the current day.",1393372800,3,163,4.857142857142857
