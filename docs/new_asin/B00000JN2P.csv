7912747,3,B00000JN2P,"This movie got so close to being something special, but never managed to get much better than mediocre. The story is almost good. It's definitely one of the better attempts at storytelling that I've seen in softcore. But in the end, there are still too many flaws, plotholes, and stretches of lame, pointless dialog to ever be anything but a softcore story.

It also doesn't manage to make much of an impression as a softcore movie either. There are only five sex scenes. Four are boy/girl and one is girl/girl. Most of the scenes are too tame and too short. The best one was Lisa Boyle's boy/girl scene, and even that one is only decent. There are also a couple of strip scenes, one of which also has Lisa, but that's it.

There's confusion about this movie regarding its unrated versus R rated status. I've heard that there is only one version of the movie and it is unrated even though the back of the packaging claims that it's R rated. Having now seen the movie, I'm inclined to believe this. The sex, although still too tame for my tastes, was more explicit than anything in the few truly R rated softcore movies that I've had the misfortune of viewing.

But this is not something that I would recommend anyway.",1114300800,3,1217,4.5227272727272725

at the bar scene the bartender should speak or swear to the owner after he bang the phone.",1054857600,,182,4.515151515151516
7912749,3,B00000JN2P,"The plot and acting is just like one of those midnight movies-actually it is. ANyways, the dissapointment was that the front cover shows Nikki nova who goes by her real name Nicole Italiano-zaza and yet she is only in the beginning. I only found Nicole and lisa Boyle worth watching. The other scenes were just okay or duds. By the way, if you are looking for special features on this dvd, don't bother.",990230400,3,403,4.534246575342466
7912750,3,B00000JN2P,"This movie actually surprised me. I have a great love of B-movies and I assume that is why Amazon recommended it to me, but I had never heard of it. I decided to take a chance and picked it up.
The storyline is cohesive. The acting is somewhat better than the acting in similar films (especially on the parts of Lisa Boyle and Colleen McDermott).
Though there is of course ample sex, it doesn't seem overly awkward or contrived. It works in the context of the picture. (With the possible exception of a single scene involving Kira Reed, whom I normally love in these movies).
In general I respect the niche for low-budget erotica, but its always a pleasant surprise when one comes along that makes a decent movie on its own merits even without being judged as a soft-core flick.",974851200,10,778,4.524822695035461
