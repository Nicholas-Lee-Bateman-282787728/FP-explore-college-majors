Here, we have a male protagonist, vs. female.  The poor fellow finds himself being squeezed out of his advertising firm, with his boss using the tired scapegoat excuse: ""what can I do? my hands are tied; my ASSOCIATE insists that you leave.""  What associate???

The idea of an influential yet invisible associate captivates our victim.  Why not employ such an illusion too?  Before long, he's jet-setting about, getting calls from Paris' elite, even the Finance Minister and the Pope.  There's no limit to what can be accomplished when your partner stands atop an infinite pedestal.

Here is where this film diverges from the modern remake.  We proceed to explore the elevated theme of business illusion, while Whoopi pursues a story more along the lines of gender and racial discrimination.  The man in this story is not fighting prejudice; he's exploiting high society's weakest foible.  It's a case of Ali Baba gaining access to untold riches simply by uttering the words ""open sesame"" -- only in this case, it's ""my associate"".

I often feel that there's a fine line between success in business, and utter failure.  This movie proves it.  Entirely plausible, it's the story of how little it takes to succeed.

-Did I mention the catchy jingle?  The soundtrack is great.",1166400000,5,1413,4.894514767932489
