8175384,5,B0002S65XG,"I first read about this movie years ago, as it was reviewed in the now defunct, ""4080"" Hip-Hop/Rap magazine. This is when it was called ""The Cheapest Movie Ever Made"". I was curious about it, but was unable to find it in any video stores. I finally found iot a while back on this site and was pleased by what I saw.

Unlike many low-budget films, this one did not have a grainy look, as far as the print. The background music actually fit the scenes and was not cheap sounding and corny. It featured some veteran actors,( Art Evans and Reynaldo Rey), which added a more professional flare to the film. And the story and plot were actually funny, as well as the acting.

I'm sure anyone who has ever struggled to get a film or any project together media-wise, with little or no money, can relate to the character Sherlock.  His friend Mango Slim, means well, but his ideas actually hurt more than help Sherlock's vision.

The bonus features are also nice. I'd seen A.J. Jamal on several comedy shows, including ""Def Comedy Jam"" has always been hiarious and the live in concert clip is an added treat.

If you like indie comedies, scoop this one up.

Note: This also the first filmed appearance of LisaRaye (The Player's Club).",1438992000,,1225,4.520361990950226

AND MAN, DID THIS MOVIE STRUCK ME! IT ALMOST KNOCK ME OFF MY FEET WHILE I WAS LAUGHING!

SECOND, IN ALL THE WORLD, THIS IS THE CHEAPEST MOVIE EVER MADE! ACTUALLY, THEY WANTED TO NAME THIS MOVIE: ""THE CHEAPEST MOVIE EVER MADE"".

IT IS PRECISELY THIS CHEAPENES THAT MAKE THIS MOVIE SO ENDEARLING FUNNY: IMAGINE WHEN THE ""DIRECTOR"" SAID TO THE ""PRODUCER AND WRITER"" THAT HE COULD MAKE A $10,000.00 MOVIE LOOK LIKE A MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE AND STARTED TO ACCOUNPLISH JUST THAT. IMAGINE THEN ""SUPER SPY 008"" THE FIRST BLACK SUPER SPY FIGHTING A GROUP OF BAD GUYS WITH A COAT HANGER BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD A ""REAL"" GUN. OR WHEN THE ONLY STUNT DOUBLE FOR EVERYONE (MAN OR WOMAN, BLACK OR ASIAN) WAS INTRODUCED AND THE ""PRODUCER"" OF THE MOVIE POINTED OUT THAT THE STUNT DOUBLE WAS A TALL WHITE DUDE WITH A MOSTACHE AND BEARD. THE ""DIRECTOR"" SAID THAT IT WAS THE ONLY STUNT DOUBLE THEY COULD FIND FOR $20.00 A DAY PLUS FOOD.

THIS IS A GEM OF A MOVIE AND I CAN ASSURE ANYONE WHO MAY BE THINKING OF BUYING THIS MOVIE THAT IT IS A FUNNY, IRREVEREND AND REFRESHINGLY FUNNY MOVIE.",1112745600,,1251,4.333333333333333
