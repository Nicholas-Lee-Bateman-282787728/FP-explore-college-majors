8291190,3,B001D263GE,"Four more episodes from Betty White's first major sitcom vehicle, LIFE WITH ELIZABETH.  Running between 1953-55, the show revolved around ordinary housewife Elizabeth (White) and her husband Alvin (Del Moore).  In quite a bold step, storylines took on a non-linear pattern, with the on-screen narrator (future game show host Jack Narz) taking us through various ""incidents"" in Elizabeth and Alvin's marriage, as opposed to regular 25-minute, self-contained stories.  In the early days of TV sitcoms it was highly unusual, and still is largely unheard-of today!  This was, at least, partly done because the producers weren't sure if they wanted to syndicate the whole show or just highlights from certain episodes....remember this was the early days of television production and ground was still being broken.

LIFE WITH ELIZABETH originated at the Los Angeles station KLAC-TV in 1952, where both White and Moore were employed at the time.  The show started out being aired live with a studio audience as part of a larger, five-hour block of variety entertainment.  White won her first Emmy Award for her performance as Elizabeth.

Betty White's charm shines through in every single episode; not to mention her strong chemistry with co-star Del Moore.  Loie Bridge has a recurring role playing the couples' interfering old neighbour, Chlorine Skinridge.  The humour is very benign; not like the slapstick of ""I Married Joan"" or the crowdpleasing, laugh-a-minute ""I Love Lucy"" by any stretch, but still very worthwhile.

Episodes:

1#  - Elizabeth poses for Alvin, who has developed a new interest in photography.  Bewildered Elizabeth ruins Alvin's breakfast and ironing during a busy morning.  An afternoon visit from Mrs Skinridge dissolves into farce.

2# - Elizabeth and Alvin quarrel over the ""suitability"" of nursery rhymes when a little niece comes to stay.  Elizabeth must face the prospect of Alvin going away on a business trip.  A quiet camping weekend in the woods with old friend Moosie turns out to be anything but.

3# - Elizabeth tries to keep Alvin's attention away from an expensive antique lamp she's just purchased.  Alvin's attempts to speed up Elizabeth when they are running late for a dinner-date go horribly awry.  Elizabeth and Alvin rehearse with Alvin's ""soft-headed"" boss Mr. Fuddy (Ray Erlenborn) for their annual revue.

4# - Elizabeth and Alvin attempt to decipher a letter written by Elizabeth's mother.  Elizabeth isn't looking forward to spending the evening at Alvin's bizarre ""Snake Lodge"".  When Alvin's slow-witted friend Richard (Dick Garton) is fired, the pair try to help him in figuring out another job.",1283040000,3,2645,5.257756563245823
