8194731,5,B000Q6UZUS,"In an interview, Martin Scorsese praised Kill, Baby, Kill as Mario Bava's masterpiece.  Blood and Black Lace takes that title for me, but only by a hair's breadth.  Each movie shows how a genius like Bava can take a genre movie and transform it into something that goes beyond the genre itself.

In Blood and Black Lace, the genre is of course the whodunit police procedural, this time in a glamorous setting.  However, Bava's real focus is not the Relentless Cop methodically tracking down The Killer, but on the sleazy underside of the outwardly beautiful characters that populate the film. The murders that occur are not devised to move the plot along - they are in a real sense the movie itself. They are brutal even by today's standards. (Keep in mind that some of the murder scenes were slightly edited for the American release, so try to view a complete version like the first VCI release).  To all this Bava adds his incredible genius for color and mood.  The result is a symphony of color, vice, beauty and murder.

Kill, Baby, Kill was the stupid title given to the American release of Operazione Paura (Operation Fear) by its distributors.  The genre here is the gothic horror-mystery.  The best ones create and sustain a mood of uneasy terror, an atmosphere that pervades the entire film.  And Kill, Baby, Kill certainly does that. Bava was not interested in turning this aspect of the genre on its head as he did with Blood and Black Lace. What he does do is consistently intensify virtually every aspect of it.  He shoots the film using a claustrophobic and believable 19th century Italian country village set. Every little detail of the costumes and the interior settings is true to the 19th century before the invention of electric illumination.  Where Bava transforms the genre is with color.  What's the first thing most people in the viewing audience of the time associated with a gothic movie? Black and white of course.  Bava certainly used black and white to great effect with his earlier film, Black Sunday. As he did with Blood and Black Lace, Bava adds his perceptive genius for color to intensify mood.  Unlike Blood and Black Lace, however, the color is not all garish and intense primary colors - it is predominantly an incredible, delicate, subtle sepia that makes the characters and sets look like mid-nineteenth century paintings.  The dark is master of the night, evil dwells within it, and there are no anachronisms to pull one out of its spell.

The village is populated by superstitious peasants who live in unspoken dread and fear. As the movie progresses, it quickly becomes apparent the source of their fear is not ignorance and superstition - it is something real, lethal and remorseless. And what is this agent of terror and death?  It is a young, seemingly innocent girl who giggles mischievously - and who just happens to be a ghost-like but incredibly powerful demon of revenge. To see her is to die a helpless violent death - by self-inflicted murder.  Not suicide, which is self-willed, but self-murder imposed by a malevolent and powerful external will.

Here I will stop. Both Kill, Baby, Kill and Blood and Black Lace contain enough elements to fill volumes and here the space is understandably limited.  My advice is to view each of these movies several times and decide which one you like best.  I like both, but I like Blood and Black Lace just a tiny bit more. Both movies stand on their own, but I find them even more incredible viewed in the context of the history of 20th century film.",1367539200,,3540,4.75
8194732,5,B000Q6UZUS,"Over the years,  many critics and fans of Euro Horror have written and given their opinions on this incredible work and now Anchor Bay Entertainment has released the definitive version (sans Blu-Ray) of Director Mario Bava's masterpiece 'KILL, BABY, KILL' aka 'OPERAZIONE PAURA' aka 'CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD'- 1966. I just had to put in my two cents in reveling in its DVD presentation of its original 1.85 transfer with gorgeous color and richness of image.  This is the version included in the second Mario Bava box set presented by Anchor Bay and it is the  European cut in Italian with English Subtitles for the first time so you can throw away all of your budget, DVD-R's, low grade transfers, etc. and watch this film the way it was meant to be seen.  One of the greatest ghost stories ever filmed, graced with a subtle screenplay by Bava, Romano Migliorini, and Roberto Natale, flawlessly photographed by Bava and Romano Rinaldi with an icing on the cake music score by Carlo Rusticelli used again in Bava's beautiful essay on sadism, 'THE WHIP AND THE BODY' aka 'LA FRUSTA E IL CORPO'- 1963,  it has influenced the works of such great directors such as Martin Scorsese, Guillermo Del Toro and even Federico Fellini using the visage of the ghostly little girl in his wonderful segment 'TOBY DAMMIT' from the anthology film based on stories by Edgar Allan Poe 'SPIRITS OF THE DEAD' aka 'HISTOIRES EXTRAORDINAIRES' -1968. The pinnacle of Bava's work as an artist, this film is an incredible achievement and deserves to be in every serious film buff's collection.",1349049600,2,1568,4.814126394052044
8194733,5,B000Q6UZUS,"This is a true Bava classic! Everybody interested in Italian Horror Films should have this one (and all other Bava Movies). ""Kill Baby Kill"" is next to ""Mask of Satan"" and ""Lisa and The Devil"" essential Bava.
The film is simply perfect- its evocation of terror and fear in a small town is very believeable. But the best thing is the atmosphere - it's claustrophobic and doomed from the first images. The way in which Bava works with colors and decorations is unparalleled.
The story itself (a ghost eeking for revenge) is quite simple as most good stories are.
The picture quality is very good (I`m stil dreaming of a complete Bava release on Blu-Ray111) and you get the uncut version.
Highly recommended!",1249257600,3,705,4.739837398373984
8194734,5,B000Q6UZUS,"Operazione Paura (literally translated as Operation Fear), is Mario Bava's 1968 gothic masterpiece.  Released in America as Kill, Baby... Kill!, this supernatural chiller draws not on gore for terror, but atmosphere.  Graveyards with wisps of dancing fog, gloom-shrouded alleyways, decaying architecture and the sparse, forbidding landscape are the true stars of this film. As with most of Bava's works, the storyline and acting is somewhat commonplace; it is Bava's skills as a director and the cinematography he demands for his films which sets his works apart from many of the other Italian horrors to hit the drive-ins and grindhouses from the `60's through the `80's.  Seen forty years later, Bava's ability to create such atmospheric films with the budget available is still extraordinary.

A fearful young woman runs from some unseen malevolence through the ruins of a rundown Transylvanian courtyard.  Up stairs and onto a platform, the woman seeks refuge from whatever stalks her; then, with a shriek, she falls from the platform onto the sharp spikes of a wrought-iron fence.  The silhouette of a small child darkens the wall beside the fence, laughing.  Thus Operazione Paura sets its tone, and all before the opening credits role.

Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) is summoned to an isolated village to perform an autopsy on the impaled woman by Inspector Kruger, who is investigating the death.  The young doctor soon learns the superstitious citizens of this village believe the town has been cursed, and that the spirit of a seven year old girl, Melissa Graps, haunts the town, killing with a glance and seeking revenge for her unfortunate death some twenty years earlier.  As the doctor arrives at the gates to the city, the silhouetted forms of four men stealing away with the coffin for burial in an attempt to prevent the autopsy foreshadow the resistance that is to be met with from the locals.  To assist with the autopsy, Inspector Kruger selected Monica (an early role for Erika Blanc, who would soon become a famous vixen of Italian horror), a local who left the village at an early age and only recently returned.  The autopsy is performed as scheduled, and the fear escalates.  Local residents begin killing themselves after reporting to have seen Melissa Graps.  Despite the fact that it is unnatural to touch the dead for an autopsy, someone is planting silver coins into the hearts of the dead.  People begin to venture to Villa Graps, former home of Melissa Graps, which is still inhabited by the reclusive Baroness Graps, Melissa's mother.  In the most chilling and memorable scene, the hand Melissa slaps a grim coated window; her pale face then slowly becomes visible.

Generally, there are to two color schemes used for Kill, Baby... Kill!.  The tangible and natural scenes of the film use a nearly monochromatic palette, shades of reds tinted with browns, while the supernatural occurrences tend to be filmed using complimentary colors, vivid greens and reds.  This is most noticeable in Villa Graps, where entire walls are lit green and reds pour through doorways.  Effective for the most part, but the number of fluorescent green spider webs hanging from ceilings only allow the viewer to suspend disbelief for a limited amount of time.  The stairway of Villa Graps likewise is lit from below with orange, and the lighting from above is a cold blue.  This use of color lends a sense of vertigo to the spiral staircase, and in all the complimentary color scheme scenes, adds to the implied conflict on screen.  Implied conflict is central to this tale, so the complimentary scheme is a logical choice.  The struggle of science and superstition, good and evil, natural and supernatural is both as basic and complex as red and green.

The unique way in which Bava directs the camera will occasionally require a bit of getting used to for the uninitiated viewer.  A scene with the camera zooming forward and up, then down and back and up, over and over captures the point of view of Melissa as she swings, overlooking the local cemetery at night.  This swinging point of view continues perhaps a bit too long, before the camera falls back and captures a view of the graveyard with Melissa swinging before it.  Obtrusive use of the zoom feature reoccur throughout the film, and while not as zoom heavy as a Jess Franco film, for instance, just as unnecessary.  The ability to capture the interplay between light and shadow, to transform a breathtakingly beautiful landscape into a surreal, gothic environment of isolation and decay, and construct such realistically detailed, atmospheric sets give any viewer cause to forgive the experimental cinematography.

This film is not to be missed by anyone interested in horror genre films or Italian cinema.  Bava has been referred to by some as the Italian Hitchcock, and this film is one of the reasons why.  At one point, Warner Brothers' studios attempted to convince Bava to move to Hollywood for a contract with them.  He turned them down, however, preferring Italy and its cinema to that of Hollywood.  If Bava did not wish to move to Hollywood, his influence did, as can be seen in films by such directors as Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino and David Lynch.",1220745600,,5249,4.974799541809851
8194735,4,B000Q6UZUS,"Okay, it's a stupid title for a movie, and it sounds like it belongs to a cheap slasher flick.

But fortunately Mario Bava's ""Kill Baby Kill"" is much better than its hokey title suggests, as one would expect from a giallo master. Instead of a slasher movie, it's a gothic horror movie with impalements, ghosts and magic. It has all the beauty -- and terror -- of a decayed fairy tale.

When a young woman leaps onto an iron fence, young Dr. Eswai (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) is called in to do an autopsy, with the help of beautiful Monica (Erica Blanc). He finds a coin in the girl's heart, and none of the townspeople will tell him -- because if they do, they will suffer a similar fate. Eswai doesn't buy all this superstition.

He's even more annoyed when local sorceress Ruth (Fabienne Dali) begins using her powers to protect a young girl from a childlike specter -- little dead aristocrat Melissa Graps. But as the bodies pile up, and Monica is plagued by bizarre nightmares, Eswai must accept Ruth's help to save Monica from the ghost, and an evil baroness.

This is more gothic horror rather than straightforward ""giallo,"" but it has the cinematic touches that Bava was known for. Bava fills the run-down village sets with broken doors, coffins, and long fluttering canopies. It's gothically delicious. But he also adds dreamlike touches -- the village is full of mist, tombstones, and green, blue and red lighting. He packs this movie so full of visual opulance, it's like being locked inside a beautiful nightmare.

And he has a knack for the really spooky stuff too. A bouncing ball, childish giggling, and a little girl on a swing become really horrifying, not to mention all those impalements on everything from fences to, uh, candlesticks. Two particularly eerie scenes have Eswai chasing himself through endless rooms, and Monica running down an endless spiral stair.

The ghost story itself is quite simple, and the secret identities of two characters are quite obvious. But fortunately, this doesn't detract from the atmosphere. How could it? ""Kill Baby Kill"" is steeped in atmosphere from the first creepy scene, and rather than building in suspense, it runs steadily all the way to the end.

And the cast helps. Despite the emotionless dubbing, Rossi-Stuart and Blanc both do outstanding jobs, but the best performance of the movie belongs to Fabienne Dali, as a tragic sorceress who is trying to save the village from Melissa's revenge. The scene where she mourns her dead lover is exquisite.

""Kill Baby Kill"" is a gorgeous, creepy ghost story, with good acting and stellar direction. Definitely a must-see for fans of atmospheric cult horror.

(Having fun, R-beyotch?)",1199232000,,2686,4.898678414096916
