8168127,3,B000MEYKBE,"I watched this DVD today as a Netflix rental.  It is certainly relaxing, a moving meditation.  Usha's voice is soothing, with the British Indian accent.

The DVD is structured into several parts.  First, there is the asanas.  Each asana is connected to breathing, always through the nose.  Clare demonstrates the movements while Usha narrates, and a bar across the screen explains the benefits of each movement.  This is not a difficult yoga sequence comparatively - it focuses on breathing, loosening the joints and relaxing muscles.  It focuses on the areas where pregnant women may have pains or complaints, like the back, ankles, etc.

Then, the DVD has a long relaxation and breathing section.  Be sure to have several pillows to support yourself in relaxation, otherwise you will get all cramped up lying on your floor like me.  The meditation is very  mindful, moving your focus around your body and then integrating your focus into the whole.

Next, there is a short section on birth, using yogic breathing through birth.  I wish it had been longer as it was just what I was looking for.

Finally, the video finishes up with Usha and Clare talking about proper eating and exercise for pregnancy.  I could have done without this but it's probably necessary for some people.  It discusses natural remedies for indigestion, the right foods to get the vitamins you need, and how to relieve constipation through food.  I must be eating healthy as I haven't had many digestive issues in pregnancy.  I fast-forwarded through the section of exercise - I just did an exercise video and already do a lot of other exercise, so I didn't need to hear a lecture on it.

Overall, it is worth watching once.",1243036800,3,1699,4.833333333333333
