1658439,2,B00005RZQT,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie after reading the book.  The book is absolutely wonderful.  The movie came across to me as slow and not near as entertaining as the book at all.  I would reccommend it if you haven't read the book, but if you have, you may be disappointed witht the quality of the movie.",1173657600,2,322,4.333333333333333
1658440,5,B00005RZQT,I saw this movie on a cable network one day and fell in love with it.  I ordered it and have just about worn it out watching it myself and showing to all my friends.  Never before have I watched a movie that will make me laugh one minute and cry the next.  Why in the world this movie wasn't released to the big screen remains a mystery to me.  I would like to see a Part 2 of Walking Across Egypt.,1173312000,,398,3.817073170731707
1658441,5,B00005RZQT,"I had not planned to watch this movie (never heard of it, I guess it went directly to video) but a co-worker just kept INSISTING.  To shut her up, I took it home from the library expecting to do a lot of fast-forwarding.  Surprise!  It is a wonderful .. WONDERFUL movie.  I can't say enough good things about it.  A total delight.  Great acting. Great story. Great moral.  I ended up buying a copy for myself and have watched it several times.",1153872000,17,443,4.329268292682927
1658442,5,B00005RZQT,"This movie is a gem and definitely warrants a place in the family video collection.  [June 12, 2007 edit: in addition to this review, the comments associated with same may help you to decide whether you agree].

The movie opens by trailing a little stray dog as it winds its way through visually stunning southern (United States) geography, eventually along a waterway up onto the porch of Mattie Rigsbee, an elderly widow, expertly played by Ellen Burstyn, where the dog's unexpected arrival sets off a cascade of events where the journey is at least as rewarding as the destination.

The story moves steadily and effectively through a continuous stream of interpersonal exchanges and juxtapositions that serves to create ongoing alternating tension and release.  Mattie attends church and hears a sermon on ""the least of these, thy brethren,"" and is moved to act upon her faith with childlike simplicity and sincerity by bringing cake and iced tea to juvenile delinquent Wesley Benfield, the dog catcher's nephew; this stands in contrast to the hypocrisy of the preacher who delivered the sermon, which becomes exposed by the end of the movie.  Mattie's advanced age stands in sharp contrast to Wesley Benfield's youth.  Yet, for all their differences, they are well matched.  Mattie tells Wesley he ought to have his mouth washed out for using a bad word; yet, she does not flinch at all when he mentions his first ""roll in the hay.""

Mattie takes life as it comes and handles every situation with aplomb, yet, Mattie's basic competence and resilience are not at all recognized or appreciated by her own middle-aged daughter who wants to move Mattie to a retirement center.  In contrast, Mattie's elderly neighbor accurately observes (to Mattie's son) that Mattie is happy and can take care of herself as she has been doing for some time.

Mattie's reference to a gun Wesley has brought into her home as a ""tool of the devil,"" smacks of an underlying gun-control agenda and does not ring true with the southern culture or values I have seen firsthand for most of my life.  The movie -- which contains scant objectionable language, the fleeting reference to premarital sex (mentioned above), and some mild violence -- shatters more stereotypes than it reinforces, by far.

In the end, Mattie realizes with joy that her belief in there being ""some good in that boy"" is well placed.  She dons the lavender suit she had set aside for her burial and excitedly sets out to rescue the stray dog and the boy, both in the ""nick of time.""

I am so impressed with this movie that I plan to read the book!",1146096000,14,2596,4.8175675675675675
1658443,5,B00005RZQT,"Although it's nice to see young hunk Jonathan Taylor Thomas in a bathtub scene, Ellen Burstyn is the heartbeat that drives this great little film.  It never got released to theaters, just direct to Blockbuster and beyond.  That's a shame because director Arthur Allan Seidelman captured some great shots of Florida that deserve to be stretched across a large cinematic canvas.  Wonderful ensemble cast, I especially loved Gwen Verdon, but then I always did.  For once, the film is every bit as good as the novel.",1139529600,6,512,4.9186046511627906
1658444,5,B00005RZQT,"Once in a while a movie comes along that is so refreshingly poignant it makes an impression.  WALKING ACROSS EGYPT is one of those quiet little gems that are hard to come by.

Ellen Burstyn has one of her best roles in years as Maddie Rigsby, an elderly woman who putters around her house and even though she manages to get stuck in her easy chair when the cushion collapses, she's still pretty durable.  After a sermon at her local church regarding do unto others, Maddie takes it on herself to visit the young nephew of the local animal control man, and takes him her pound cake and iced tea.  Wesley is a hard-nosed, cynical young man, who has gone from orphanage to foster home to the juvenile detention center for stealing a car.  Wesley asks Maddie if she is his grandmother, giving us our first inkling into what Wesley has missed in his life.  When he and another fellow inmate escape after tangling with the musclebound Johnny, Wesley sees Maddie as an easy mark and charms his way into a place to stay for a few days and to steal money so he can go off to Florida.  Maddie also has a grown son, who is in his late thirties without any romantic involvements, and a daughter who thinks Maddie should opt for a retirement home.  It isn't long before Maddie and Wesley develop a strong relationship:  she throws him in the river to make him learn to swim; takes him fishing; treats him special.

What makes the movie work so well is Burstyn's believably real performance; she doesn't try and act like a former Oscar winner; she's tough, touching and ultimately heartwarming.  Jonathan Taylor Thomas scores big as Wesley, his pumped up bravado swiftly replaced by a sense of wonder as he discovers things he's missed; Mark Hamill is fine as Wesley's uncle, the animal catcher who marvels at the changes in his young nephew; Judge Reinhold and Gail O'Grady are effective as Maddie's children, he a little more accessible than O'Grady's cool aloofness.  Harve Presnell and the late Gwen Verdon are funny as Maddie's dotty neighbors and Pat Corley offers a fine sheriff.

WALKING ACROSS EGYPT is a quiet, yet majestic film that tugs at the heart and its ending which seems to be heading to tragedy has a redemptive and satifying conclusion.",1138665600,56,2242,4.6313131313131315
1658445,5,B00005RZQT,Thought provoking!  Do we mean what we say or are they just words?  Amazing possibilities if we take to heart what is said and believe.  I'm referring to the preacher's sermon on Matthew 25:36.  Interesting his reaction later to someone taking to heart what he said.  Sadly typical.  Walking Across Egypt was like a breath of fresh air or a swim on a hot day in a favorite swimming hole.,1119657600,13,387,4.457142857142857
1658446,3,B00005RZQT,"Quite unexpectedly, I was invited to watch this movie by two acquaintances who had read Clyde Edgerton's book which inspired this adaptation.  They knew what to expect.  I did not.  At first, I found it difficult to watch the scenes of the youth in detention, and thought the old lady was silly.

This film was produced by an Independent studio with a far-out name to be viewed only in the U.S. and Canada; maybe other countries would not understand the coloquial dialogue.  Based in North Carolina, the accents were a little affected, but here in East Tennessee I am learning they speak their own type.  You have to hear it to believe it.  It's almost like a foreign language.

 The subject matter is as old as life itself.  Title of her favorite hymn and a saying she has when a stray dog enters her limited existence and she has no time to care for it.  Early on, a humorous occurrence changes her life when she gets stuck in her rocking chair while watching her favorite soap operas on television.  Thank goodness, she has called the animal control and the dogcatcher enters her house after he hears her calls for help when he comes to take the dog.  Mattie, played by Ellen Burstyn, is lonely because her children check on her intermittenly at their convenience, but she does have nosey neighbors who have to know every little thing going on.

She's rescued by Lamar who has to break the chair to get her out as she is so tightly wedged in; in the process, his wallet slips out and, when he calls about it, she insists he come to get it at meal time.  He offers to repair the chair and she (nosey little thing) reads a letter which is sticking out of the wallet he left on the table.  He has a nephew in a lot of trouble.

Sixteen-yr-od Wesley, played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, is an orphan whose life is threatened in a pre-pen environment, a place she has no idea of the reality as she unknowingly ""adopts"" him as the grandson she's yearned for -- someone who needs her.  He was convinced she just had to be his grandmother, since he had no knowledge of his mother or family except for uncle Lamar.

Her middle-aged, pompous son was too heavy for the ladder which comes apart in the middle and is left hanging from the gutter.  He discovers Wesley there doing chores and foolishly insists on doing the work himself.  The daughter wants to transplant her to a retirement home to be near people her own age.

Her involvement in helping this young boy revives a life gone to seed.  Wesley couldn't get enough bubble baths, but was afraid of water when she took him fishing at the spot where her father had taken her in times past.  It was freakish how he learned to swim.  He is a product of his environment, and this film shows the harsh reality of life as it still is in certain situations.

The ending is touching as she revives her strength and has a reason to live.  She's like a new person with a pride not just in her 'good cooking' skills but with a purpose, a destiny to help another human being she considers as 'the least of us' as interpreted by her Baptist preacher.  He needed to practice what he preaches, as does his interfering wife who looks like Namuni Young, who want to ostracize Mattie -- who shows them a thing or two.

There were 'laugh-out-loud' parts of this movie, and some which may make you want to cry.  If you are feeling low or things just aren't working out, this book will revive your faith in humankind.",1105920000,9,3443,4.419047619047619
1658447,5,B00005RZQT,This movie is awesome.  I highly recommend this to everyone. It is great for decent family entertainment.,1100476800,,105,5.176470588235294
1658448,4,B00005RZQT,Walking Across Egypt has a misleading title many will think they are about to view a travelogue.  How wrong they will be!  This is an enjoyable movie about second chances and seeing beyond the exterior.  At times it is stereotypical of the south and church goers but its message is worthwhile none the less.  I would recommend this well-hidden gem of a movie.,1086912000,4,359,4.650793650793651

1658485,4,B00005RZQT,I read the book and then watched the movie.

1658508,5,B00005RZQT,"How this movie has gone ""under the radar"" is beyond me.  This movie is my #1 choice for the ""surprisingly great movie that nobody seems to have ever seen or heard of"" category.  As a Christian, I enjoy movies that bolster my faith.  This one did that, though it is done in such a way that I believe you could not be a Christian and still very much enjoy this movie.

This movie shows a ""simple"" elderly woman that heard what the Bible said about something (that her ""religious"" pastor preached on) and decided to take it at face value and actually put it into practice (imagine THAT!).  Later on, we even see the pastor that preached on it and fellow congregants get upset because she did so (which sadly doesn't seem too far from what might really happen at some churches).

Besides the excellent message of putting your faith into practice by actively LOVING (and then seeing all the ""religious"" people getting up in arms about it!), the result of that love in helping to change old ways and ""break through"" to a hardened person is present, as is one of not just sitting around waiting to die as an elderly person.  This is GREAT stuff!

There are two versions of this movie out there: the original and a family-friendly edited version (put out by Feature Films for Families). The original has some bad language - mostly of the milder variety though there are a few briefly uncomfortable scenes with sexual references (but no sexual situations). While I generally very much dislike movies with cursing and can't say I liked the language, it was generally within the context of the ""hardened"" boy and the language improves as things go along. In some ways, it actually could be argued that some of it adds to the story and helps deepen the impact of the message of the movie, which is something you can't say about 99% of the bad language in most movies. As mentioned though there also exists a family-friendly edited version. The edited version eliminates ALL the bad language and also makes several other changes including eliminating a major (and funny) scene involving the presence of a gun, and shortening fight and smoking scenes. All told it's about 10 minutes shorter than the original.

I'm honestly kind of torn which I prefer. The original is a bit more realistic, which given the fact that a central part of the movie is the effect that love has on a ""hardened"" youth, does help hammer that in better. By the edited version removing the language, and some of the smoking and violence-related stuff of the youth, the transformation that you see occur doesn't pack as much of a punch in my opinion. And the removal of what I consider an important scene involving a gun was a shame in my opinion - it, along with a few other removed scenes, I felt helped the movie more than it hurt it. On the other hand, if you really just want to see a sweet story without having your ears assaulted with any bad language and/or want to let kids see this movie too, then the edited version is the way to go. My ideal version of this movie would be a cross between the original and the edited. There's definitely a few lines and some bad words I would remove, but generally I would leave the rest alone. Although, as mentioned, I do not generally support bad language in movies, in this case, at least in regards to the language that the kid uses, it is actually called out as bad by the woman and as he learns from her and receives her love, his language improves. So it actually leaves the viewer mostly in a state where they generally don't see the language as cool, but rather something to be avoided.

If you do watch as a group (as a family or a church group), some good follow-up discussion could be really helpful. There are some great messages in this movie worthy of discussion. This is one movie that really could be a great one for church small groups to watch and discuss.

And for non-Christians, this is still an enjoyable ""low key"" movie with a great story!  It is mostly a low-key drama with some ""unique"" comedy (though genuinely funny in certain places), so as long as you don't expect to constantly laugh or be enthralled with action every 30 seconds, you'll probably like it just fine.

Though this is a lower-budget type movie, the acting is pretty well-done and believable, and generally I have no complaints about the filming style or picture quality.  I hope some day this comes out in widescreen on Blu-Ray, though I suspect I may be waiting for a very long time.

Pick this movie up if you get a chance - I doubt you'll be sorry. :)

While reading the book my wife and I laughed out loud and did the same while watching the movie.  Have to admit the movie was much more dramatic than the book however loved seeing the characters come to life on the screen.
Would certainly recommend seeing the movie however please read
the book first.

1658510,5,B00005RZQT,"The first time I watched this excellent film (I really can't add to what has already been written), I knew I had to share it with a young friend and his siblings.  So I purchased this version of the movie (assuming all were the same)to give to them.  However, unbeknownst to me, the movie I had originally been given was edited for family viewing (i.e, no obscenities).  This movie version has not. I was shocked when I learned of this because that's the last thing these children need to have reinforced.  They hear too much of it as it is. So, buyer beware!",1303689600,3,559,4.398058252427185
1658511,5,B00005RZQT,A very good movie! I would watch this again and recommend for a family motion picture to share with young people. It is the kind of movie that makes you believe their are good people in this world and care about others. Acting was excellent!,1301875200,,241,4.377777777777778
1658512,5,B00005RZQT,"Have loved this movie for a long time.  Reminds us to make room for others who need a helping hand.  It also challenges us to do something for others, even if it costs us more than we planned.  Quite a few laughs along the way, yet it helps you see how some people in society suffer more than we realize.",1291766400,,304,4.033333333333333

Also is a lesson in how we should treat people who are less fortunate than we are.  I had never heard of this movie until a couple years ago.  I have been searching for the DVD ever since that time.

1658517,5,B00005RZQT,"I read the book first and was sure I would be disappointed with the movie. Wrong. Even though the movie had some big name stars the story was the star. Seldom is a senior citizen the focus in a movie and usually they are portrayed as addled, sticky sweet or mean as a snake. They got it just right this time. The story in a nutshell is that those who don't have a family want one and those who do have a family don't appreciate them. This movie has a beginning and an ending with a middle that worked. How refreshing. I loved the small, unpretentious book and loved the small, unpretentious movie. Its a small miracle.",1279584000,2,618,4.2905982905982905

When we saw it had come out on DVD we bought that thinking it was the same movie. Well it is except that a WHOLE BUNCH OF CUSSING has been added to the DVD version, and in this parents opinion, is completely unacceptable for the young audience it was intended for. Why anyone would add cussing to a family film is beyond me but I felt the need to warn other parents because theres a lot of it. Buy the VHS version NOT the DVD version. Now we're stuck with the DVD and I wouldn't even sell it because of the language. We'll have to spend even more money now to get the VHS version and I guess we'll destroy the DVD.",1276992000,2,736,4.01360544217687
