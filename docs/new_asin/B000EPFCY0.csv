2526891,5,B000EPFCY0,"""Cross of Fire"" chronicles the rise and fall of David Curtis Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana in the 1920s.  Known as ""Steve"", Stephenson was a power-hungry man who had no qualms about removing anyone who got in his way on his climb up the ladder toward political power.  He aspired to the Presidency, ridiculous as that seems.  John Heard is perfect as the charming, sociopathic Stephenson.  Lloyd Bridges and Mel Harris give straightforward performances as Stephenson's defense attorney and victim, respectively.  Well-researched; accurate, deserves more attention.",1232755200,13,594,5.413043478260869

8112608,5,B000EPFCY0,"I had seen the TV movie years ago and never quite forgot it.  Still pertinent today, even though the events took place in the 1920s.  I've shown it to a couple of my friends and they have enjoyed it too.",1484611200,,203,4.05
8112609,4,B000EPFCY0,A docudrama of the secret history of the rise and fall of the KKK in 1920's America.  Everyone should watch this movie and realize how easily people can be mislead into doing the wrong thing.,1447200000,,191,4.457142857142857

8112611,5,B000EPFCY0,"Saw this as a TV mini-series some years ago.  CROSS OF FIRE is based upon a true story, depicting the rise and fall of the charismatic but sociopathic leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana during the 1920s.  Incredible as it sounds today, Indiana was one of the nation's greatest strongholds of the Klan in the 20s.  John Heard does a remarkable job of portraying KKK Grand Dragon D.C. ""Steve"" Stephenson, who had top politicians in his pocket and believed he was above the law--in fact, stated that he was so powerful that he WAS the law in Indiana.  Transcripts from the actual trial were used in the courtroom scenes.",1433808000,2,620,4.558558558558558

8112614,5,B000EPFCY0,"The story is based on the true story of a charismatic  Ku Klux Klan leader in the 1920's, how he influenced good, conscientious citizenry of the Midwest to join and celebrate the Klan. It became almost completely respectable to be a part of it.  But  then his ego took over completely.  He ultimately caused the death of a well-liked and respected townswoman, leading to his own downfall, and the Klan's loss of power.  It's so difficult today, here and now, to realize the following this group achieved, that so many people can be persuaded to believe in something so ugly when it is disguised as high morality.  Although the film was made some years back, it's quality stands the test of time.  It is well-acted and is well worth watching, whether as pure entertainment or a bit of surprising history.",1403827200,7,803,4.692857142857143
8112615,2,B000EPFCY0,Great interesting intriguing movie opens your eyes about your own country and it Dark history . Makes me wonder how this could happen in the country that was built on freedom for all,1398556800,,182,4.545454545454546
