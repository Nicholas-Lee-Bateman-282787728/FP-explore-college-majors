7536412,1,B017XZUT3C,"Bill Murray is a hugely entertaining guy who can do pretty much anything he wants. He can sing, dance a little, and if he needs to get dramatic he's not so bad at that, either. One thing he can't do is save the terribly outdated and unfunny Rock the Kasbah, a film about awful Americans and the horrid things they do in the Middle East. It's bad enough to offend audiences on multiple continents.

With direction by Barry Levinson one might think it would have the same cultural smarts as his Good Morning Vietnam, and maybe it would if Mitch Glazer wasn't the screenwriter. Glazer, a Murray confidante who most notably worked with him on Scrooged, must secretly hate his friend for putting him through this mess. Murray plays down 'n out rock music manager Richie Lanz, a guy with an inflated ego and sense of self (his favorite lie is that he discovered Madonna) whose practice has hit the skids. He's working out of a rundown hotel and his only client is the barely-talented Ronnie (Zooey Deschanel) who also works as his secretary. The film is basically a bunch of random encounters with characters you won't ever care about, and the plot kicks into gear when one such meeting leads to Richie taking Ronnie to Afghanistan to work a USO tour.

Of course it's a disastrous idea; Kabul turns out to be a complete war zone (shocker!!) which freaks out Ronnie. But she's totally cool with the weirdo gun-toting mercenary (Bruce Willis) who easily picks her up at the hotel lounge, and then whisks her away under the cover of night. Richie barely seems to care that she's gone except that he no longer has an act, no money, and no way home. That we never see her again is barely an issue, but such is the lackadaisical treatment of all the relationships in this film. Richie makes friends with a pair of loudmouth American gun dealers (Danny McBride and Scott Caan) who set him up for a gun smuggling run. Why does he do it? Who knows, and it doesn't really matter. Richie also becomes fast friends with a local prostitute (Kate Hudson) looking to retire, but not until she screws him so good that he makes her his partner-in-crime or something.

After a wildly inept and unfocused hour what marginally resembles a plot emerges when Richie hears Salima (Leem Lubany), a young Pashtun girl singing in a cave late one night. Women are forbidden from singing in her culture and to be caught doing so could mean death, but what the heck, it's a sign from God or something so Richie becomes her manager in hopes of having her appear on Afghan Star, an American Idol-style reality show. The film settles into a half-baked empowerment story about women in the Middle East breaking free of the shackles placed upon them. Maybe that would be a fine path for Glazer's story to take if he had started it about 45 minutes earlier, but the vast majority of the film consists of Richie bouncing around like a marble and getting into bizarre situations. While billed as a comedy there are practically no laughs and the mood is surprisingly grim. Are we supposed to find it funny when Richie's caravan gets bombed and everyone nearly dies? Or how about when he gets shot in the middle of a firefight? Or when Salima is threatened with death? Oh, what knee-slappers those moments were.

Rock the Kasbah establishes no lasting emotional connections between any of its characters. A scene between Richie and his estranged daughter might as well not exist, except that it sets up a baffling mid-credits sequence that will leave a bad taste in your mouth. By then you'll be willing to eat a handful of desert sand than endure another minute.  The film is loosely based on a true story about the real Afghan Star show and the women who literally risk their lives to get on the stage and sing. A documentary was made about it and is far better than anything Rock the Kasbah has to offer.",1448323200,8,3862,4.591304347826087
7536413,1,B017XZUT3C,"This movie sucks. Predicable, boring, Bill murray's acting effort reminded me of someone who is about a week away from retiring. You know the type.  Physically they show up to work, but mentally they checked out a year ago.  They're of no use to anyone anymore. But they used to be good, back when they gave a crap, so you wish them the best and give them a little going away party.  Here's your retirement cake Bill.

7536415,5,B017XZUT3C,"I did not have high expectations for this movie, especially after watching how it begins (with Bill Murray's character Richie Lanz lying to an older woman with a weird singing style that she ""has talent"" just so he can bilk her out of a promoter fee of $1,200).  I thought, ""Another cheesy little film with a plot derivative of all other cheesy little films, I am sure.""  But over and over again the film proved me wrong.

Sure, I could have done without the Pretty-Woman-cliche Kate Hudson plays (prostitute who is not only drop-dead gorgeous but classy and smart about business) and many other improbable aspects of the plot.  But still:  Zooey Deschanel's character is hilarious, the first time you see Bruce Willis he is genuinely scary and psycho-looking (after that his character is never again scary or even interesting), the story is not at all predictable (until near the end) . . . BUT!  The real gem is Bill Murray, who is just HILARIOUS.  For me, Bill Murray is not always a joy to watch, but he certainly is in this film.

This could literally be one of Bill Murray's finest performances, and that is saying a lot.  Groundhog Day may be a better movie, but the character Bill Murray plays in Groundhog Day is not as funny as the character he plays in this movie, Rock the Kasbah.  I am serious.  Being upbeat and always able to see the silver lining in every situation is Richie Lanz' job as a promoter, Bill Murray is completely believable as Richie Lanz, and Richie Lanz is, quite simply, very fun to watch.  This film is a comedy because Bill Murray is the star AND the 'comic relief.'

You know why this film has so few 4 & 5 star reviews?  Because the film is sympathetic towards natives of Afghanistan and realistically portrays the devastation which U.S. involvement in that country has wrought -- period.  Too many Americans do not want to be reminded of the negative consequences of our military presence, and the discomfort this film no doubt causes them completely outweighs the humor of the story.  At least that is my conclusion, based on things I have read in Amazon reviews.",1499385600,,2102,4.62533692722372

While fictional, the film is loosely inspired on.a real tv show Afghan Star in which contestants perform in an American Idol style competition. I wish the ending was more well developed.

7536442,2,B017XZUT3C,"The first 30 minutes or so of this film was pretty good, but then it suddenly shifted gears from a well-paced, light-hearted comedy to a humorless drama that seemed to drag on forever. It's like they took two different scripts and tried to splice them together somehow. Bill Murray's performance was really the only thing that held the movie together from beginning to end.

Probably the most puzzling part of the movie to me was how they wove some hilarious parts with Danny McBride into the storyline and then just suddenly disappeared his character. Honestly, there were no big laughs after his character disappeared and after that the movie just seemed to drag on and on. Bruce Willis' part started off amusing enough, but then just swerved into a lame drive-by performance as well. Kate Hudson... Unconvincing and DOA insofar as humor goes.

If you are a HUGE Bill Murray fanboy this might be worth your time. If you are expecting a comedy I would definitely avoid it though. It's a movie that had a lot of potential, but just ended up dying a slow, humorless death.",1472947200,,1071,4.721925133689839

And if you didn't know there was an ""American Idol"" type show in Afghanistan, go ahead and watch it. You aren't human if you don't smile a lot during this one. If you see Afghanistan and are expecting 13 hours, American Sniper, and Zero Dark Thirty.... this isn't that. But there's a lot of good here. One Afghan actor in the film who portrays the singers father said it's the first time in 78 roles that he wasn't cast as a terrorist.

7536464,3,B017XZUT3C,"Bill Murray can and has singlehandedly saved or moved a film along the path to success.  Alas, this film does not rank among them.  Actors, even famous ones, pick their projects for reasons other than art.  Or pick them for reasons other than entertainment.  Ah well, this at best average time waster will not rank among Murray's greatest moments.
  Murray plays a Hollywood promoter at the end of his career and at the end of his rope.  He grasps at the chance to get  some income by taking his 'talent' (an under used Zooey Deschanel) on a tour of American Army bases in Afghanistan for the USO.  Things go badly wrong, naturally, shots get fired and we guess but we never see people actually die.  As social commentary it has a certain limp feeling to it.  We see hard faced locals often, hear death threats often but never actually see any carnage.  Nor to we see an American whore in Kabul (Kate Hudson, also ill used in the film) ply her trade, we just hear about it.  Fans to movie guys-this does not make drama.
  Scott Caan and Danny McBride under play their roles as despicable arms merchants.  Cann always delivers but McBride surprised me in his atypical low key (for him) performance.  Bruce Willis walks through an undemanding role as a hired body guard.
  New actress Leem Lubana plays Salima, a local girl who the promoter manages to get on Afghan Star, a popular TV show with a huge viewership.
  We like to see Leem in her brief time on screen and we like a lot to hear her sing.  The two songs she sings are both wonderful.  Both songs come from the talent of Cat Stevens.  If not for those two songs and Leem's heart breaking voice, the film would totally waste our time.
  The film was made largely in Morocco, a much safer place to film than Afghanistan even today.
  Hudson and Deschanel went to high school together and both can act if given better material to work with.  They also worked together on ""Almost Famous"".
  Ironically in a film which pivots on Muslim barbarity and violence, the two songs that make the film are products of Cat Stevens.  Stevens changed his name to Josef Ibraham after his conversion to Islam.
  The story has occasional parallels to the life of Afghani singer Setara Hussainzada who appeared on Afghan Star in 2007.  She now lives in semi-seclusion, her fame has endangered her life in Kabul.",1466208000,,2348,4.54916067146283

7536482,3,B017XZUT3C,"I doubt if there was a mainstream movie from 2015 that was lambasted more by critics (8% on the Tomatometer) than this comedy.  So going in I had very low expectations.  But with a stellar cast, I figured what the hell.  Bill Murray is the one redeeming value in the film, but even he only elicits a handful of laughs.  He plays Richie Lanz, a washed up talent manager, who may or may not have once been well known.  As his sunset years approach his only act is singer Ronnie (Zooey Deschanel), whose best gigs are in local bars.

With some coaching from a drunk in the audience, he decides to take Ronnie and go to Afghanistan and play for the troops.  Ronnie is unconvinced but goes along, but once arriving she decides this isn't her idea of fun.  She takes Richies passport (?) and money and gets out of Kabul on the next camel with help from an American mercenary (?) played by Bruce Willis.  We never see her again.  Richie cant get a passport from the Embassy for 2-weeks (?) so he finds some companionship with a couple of small arms dealers (Danny McBride & Scott Caan) who give him the opportunity to run some guns to a tribal leader out in the suburbs.

Richie also finds solace and companionship with Merci (Kate Hudson), a prostitute who lives in a trailer behind a picket fence.  Yes Kate Hudsons character is so hard up she has to go to Afghanistan to sell herself (?).  In one scene, she has to close up shop early so she tells the waiting line of a dozen men or so, no STDs today, sorry.

When Richie hits the village a couple hours away with his guns for sale, hes invited to stay over, along with his cab driver (Arian Moayed) who also acts as his translator.  He hears a young woman singing late at night.  Shes singing Cat Stevens classics and has a beautiful voice.  So Richie gets the bright idea to enter her into Kabuls TV talent show, their version of American Idol.  But, thats a no-no in Kabul, let alone in rural Afghanistan.

The biggest problem with this Barry Levinson bomb is that it is directionless, both literally and figuratively.  Once in a while a little serious talk creeps in.  Richie begins to doubt his own self-worth.  Characters drift in and out.  Guns aren't fired when they most likely would have been.  Guns are fired out of the blue.  Is the movie as bad as everyone suggest?  Well, no, at least for me.  Is it a good movie?  Oh, hell no.  As soon as it hits free TV go ahead and watch.  Youll only be out 106 minutes of your life.",1461974400,,2480,4.328260869565217

 women from singing(especially in English), a penalty that could bring even death.  Murray must overcome the cultural bounds to get his new found star the prominence she deserves.  Kate Hudson adds a little, Bruce Willis adds nothing.  Murray is Murray, if you enjoy his blase way of acting.  The production gives a feel of being in war torn Afghanistan and that's a plus.

7536644,2,B017XZUT3C,"It seems that ROCK THE KASBAH can't go wrong with its great cast,  well-respected director and writer. Yet, unfortunately, it goes wrong..very wrong. Here's Bill Murray playing several characters from the classic Saturday Night Live days but all rolled into one annoying, dishonest, and pathetic former rock manager. Richie Lanz (Murray) supposedly discovered Madonna and was tight with other rock stars of the day. Although it's not clear as to how true these stories are, we do seem him in a shabby room in Van Nuys, CA offering to manage seriously untalented singers for an upfront fee. The scam is the thing of broken dreams in Los Angeles. He does have one amazingly talented singer Ronnie (a very likable Zooey Deschanel and it does seem like the lady can really sing) and somehow they are booked to do a USO tour in Afghanistan.

The war zone soon terrifies Ronnie and she runs off with Richie's money and passport. Trapped in Afghanistan,  Richie accidentally gets involved with gun-running thugs and an exotic hooker (Kate Hudson). The gun runners drive around Kabul in a convertible with a serious ""don't mess with me driver"" and make an offer Richie can't refuse.  Can Richie be redeemed in the end when he discovers an Afghani teen with an angelic voice?Can he get her on the Afghani version of American Idol?

There is just so little to enjoy in this mindless film. Even star talent, a respected director and writer can't save this wreck. Murray is annoying and obnoxious in typical Murray fashion throughout the film. Believe me, I like Murray but he seems lost in this film. There is a brief spark of magic in Murray as he sneaks off to say goodbye to his daughter through her bedroom window unbeknownst to his ex-wife. Sweet scene that proves Murray can do comedy and drama together.",1455580800,6,1799,4.790322580645161

The movie takes inspiration from the real American Idol inspired TV show Afghan Star and a female singer, Setara Hussainzada, who performed without a Hijab at one point. The basic premise of the show that a woman has never appeared on the show is also not true.

Bill Murray wandering through the dessert wheeling and dealing is great. But the movie treats a complex culture and political environent like a cartoon. All of the talk about the main character potentially being killed just made me think of Malala Yousafzi and made me cringe.

7536710,4,B017XZUT3C,"I say if you're a Bill Murray fan then you should check out this movie. If you love old Murray -- most notably Stripes -- then I think you'll enjoy this. Its not bad. There are some bizarre characters and scenes that don't feel fleshed out, but it's Murray being Murray. What else could you ask for?",1450137600,16,299,4.2631578947368425

8740951,4,B017XZUT3C,"This one was pretty much trashed and dismissed by the elites and ignored at the box office but really needs reevaluation.  Simple message.  Rock 'n' roll heals all wounds.  So if you have a seemingly unresolved conflict just kick out the jams.  I love the fact that the conduit to peace are a couple Cat Stevens gems.  Flick has legit rock cred dropping asides about Eddie Money, Alabama (?!), and the Bangles.  Bill Murray is incapable of a bad performance delivering an affectionate account of a marginal rock promoter dropped into the Afghan war zone.  Good turns by Bruce Willis as a mercenary and Kate Hudson as the requisite whore with a heart of gold.  Names escape me but the Arabic actors were quite good particularly the winsome lass trying to break into the Afghan version of ""American Idol"".  A definite sleeper worthy of your attention.",1532217600,,849,4.760273972602739
