Anyway, the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because rarely, the video would jump (not too often though). Plus! If this was on DVD, I would have given it a full 5 stars because the video wouldn't have jumped because it is on DVD",1421193600,,344,3.7916666666666665
7879030,4,6304791305,"i had become attached to the original TV series voices, and when i purchased this tape...i was really dissappointed!  (also, the ghost cat i found INCREDIBALLY annoying...).  nevertheless, i was still humored by Ryoga's ""cat habits.""  in the second episode, both akane and ranma's fathers become enemies over a game/food ""dissagreement""....it was humerous, but not the best i've seen.  (i loved how Soun chockes on the potato, though...^-^).  Definately not the best Ranma, but you'll get a couple laughs.",998265600,,505,5.341772151898734
7879031,4,6304791305,"Takahashi Rumiko has a hold over some to the creative control of her Ranma anime series, something which is often not seen when something is moved from manga or text to anime.
I orginally bought this video because I liked the character Ukyo, hoever the manga version visually did not do her any just in appearance.  The story is exactly the same as the manga, not surprising since the video and manga are published by Viz.  It is funny, though not the funniest, but Ranma does get himself into a bind with women, again.",979689600,,519,4.51063829787234
7879032,5,6304791305,"Ranma 1/2 continues to be hilarious!  In this one, you meet Ukyo, okonmiyaki chef.  And guess what-she's also yet another one of Ranma's fiancees!  To find out more, watch this video!",960595200,,183,4.838709677419355
7879033,3,6304791305,"If you've gotten attached to the great voice actors/actresses from Ranma 1/2: Outta Control or Hard Battle, you will be sorely disappointed. The voices change dramatically. In addition, the tape ISN'T 52 minutes long,  it's 46... and about 8 of those 46 are previews for other Viz Videos.  Besides that, both episodes on this tape/dvd contain references to another  episode... so be prepared to surf the 'Net to find out what's going on...  unless you're such an otaku that you already know... it's good, but sort of  a let down from what you might expect.",960508800,3,556,4.810526315789474
