8725449,5,B0125KPHYG,"These are the ABSOLUTE best I've seen on these titles.  Believe me I have bought some of these shorts many times over. I had given up after buying the same crap time and time again over the last 30 years.
 The music tracks by Ben Model are terrific.  I wish that they would put real covers on these and not this terrible generic one for each volume.  It made me think this was a rip off until I was told that the great Model was involved with this release.  I will be picking up other volumes when I can (retired and living on SS..sigh) and will report on each one as I do.
Next to the wonderful German set of all the surviving MGM/Roach silent OUR GANG shorts from Kinowelt , this is no doubt the best collection out there featuring the OUR GANG silent shorts.  These are all Pathe/Roach shorts from 1926-1928.  Pre MGM.
There is some evident restoration here and these are all the uncut two reelers to the best of my knowledge.
There is room for improvement, but compared to what I have seen, these, apparently from transfers done in-house, are probably the best the films will ever look.  Yes, these are a bit scratchy and possibly from home 8mm, but most Pathes only survive in these versions.
They even seemingly have re-created the original Pathe open titles on a couple.  Bravo to Reelclassicdvd.com for going the extra mile!

Here's what you get on this volume:

1. TELLING WHOPPERS (1926)  Good one for Farina fans.  There's Tuffy the bully is after him.  Re-created titles and inter-titles.
2. SEEING THE WORLD (1927) A travelogue with the Gang and James Finlayson.  They are actually on location at various European sites.  The reproduction of the opening Pathe titles is perfect.  The kids sing Our Country Tis of Thee and Model does as well.  So great to see this without the usual needle drop music that doesn't fit.  What a treat to have these original piano scores that perfectly fit the film.  This is a bit too dark, but this is the problem with ALL prints of this title.  Here it's very enjoyable.
TEN YEARS OLD (1927) Gorgeous copy of this.  With original titles for sure.  This may be a 35mm print here.
BABY BROTHER (1927)  Ditto.  This is heads and hooves over any copy out there.
THE SMILE WINS (1928)  Re-created titles and it looks like they inserted new inter-titles.  Many of the copies of the Pathes only exist with the inter-titles missing.  Again, this company is going the extra mile.

This is the 5th of 5 volumes so far.  I bought this one because some of these are titles that were scarce and /or I had them in un-watchable condition.  I hope the other volumes are up to this level.  I have a feeling that they are.  Can we hope for more of these??
Again, get rid of these covers as they look like cheap worthless bootleg crap.  I passed on this a bunch of times without even looking at the description.  I thought this was another Classic Video Streams type of overly priced release where they go on YouTube and give you the same muddy, pixlated 10th generation VHS copies for their material.  This is the real deal and needs to be supported by the Little Rascals fans.
What I wouldn't do for a set of all the surviving OUR GANG/LITTLE RASCALS silent Pathe shorts in this kind of quality!",1449446400,4,3224,4.479381443298969
