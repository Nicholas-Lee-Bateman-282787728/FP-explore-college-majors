8461229,5,B00581DANA,"I strongly recommend to watch ""Last Days Here"" first, which is a phenomenal documentary about the singer of Pentagram, Bobby Liebling.
You will understand the whole story behind this great concert and will see the DVD & included interview with different eyes. Perhaps you will get a  Pentagram fan - like me. By the way, the DVD of the concert has a great picture & sound.",1389830400,,372,4.636363636363637
8461230,5,B00581DANA,"Like one of the other reviewers said, watch LAST DAYS HERE so that you ""get it"".  This video is simple in its greatness.  It is only a 3 or 4 camera shoot but it is excellent!  The video reminds me of a retro 70's concert shoot.  Pro but vintage looking, very cool.  The sound is top notch.  If you want to see a nice PRO current recording of the band, this is it!  Now go buy EVERYTHING else they did!",1356307200,2,402,3.95
8461231,5,B00581DANA,"I don't write reviews very often, but for this DVD I just had to.  This band is amazing in every way. Buy this DVD, buy their albums.  You won't be dissapointed.",1339804800,2,161,4.161290322580645
8461232,5,B00581DANA,"Great video and sound quality throughout, a really fine production. Song selection is awesome, music and vocals sound great. Wish there would have been a little more to the DVD case, like a liner or something. If you're a Pentagram fan this is a must have. If you like Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus, Blue Cheer, Blue Oyster Cult, or acid rock/stoner metal in general you'll enjoy this!

A word of warning for those who've never seen Bobby Liebling before - he's like the sun, don't look directly at him! ;) And Victor Griffin is a badass on this video.",1337731200,5,549,4.545454545454546
8461233,5,B00581DANA,"First off, watch the interview with Bobby Liebling.  It will give you an insight into him as a person.  It will help take the edge off of Bobby's eccentric performance; for those not prepared for it.  The music is unbelievable.  It's hard to believe that they had not had a bigger career.  Most of it equals or is better than Black Sabbath's best stuff IMO.",1316649600,8,357,4.430769230769231
