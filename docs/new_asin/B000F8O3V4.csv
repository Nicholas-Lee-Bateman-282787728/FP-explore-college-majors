8119048,1,B000F8O3V4,This is not part of the What's New Scooby Doo Volume set. It shows Volume 2 on the picture and clearly shows that 4 episodes are on the DVD ... but it is actually only 2 episodes from that volume ... NOT the full volume as pictured. I ordered it and got the wrong one .. sent it back and they sent me the same thing a second time. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon ... but I was really frustrated that I couldn't actually get a PERSON to understand my problem. I just kept getting these emails back from someone who obviously didn't read my email or understand what was going on ... maybe it was automated .. who knows! I finally just gave up and found it at Walgreen's for $5.99. Bottom line ... don't order this if you want Volume 2!,1168041600,4,725,4.076923076923077
