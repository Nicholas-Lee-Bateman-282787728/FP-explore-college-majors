5888205,5,B00E3PLMS2,"This DVD by Mr. Hawking and friends is really an instruction in modern physics, and is very good!",1430179200,2,97,4.444444444444445
5888206,1,B00E3PLMS2,"We are living in a new Dark Age, the Lite Age of superimposed superficiality. This DVD [and the book]  is reflective as a very problematic, deeply troubled BUT visually slick thesis well beyond the scope of true science. Questions and problems: 1/ Is Hawkings tragic physical condition a result of a failed evolutionary path  presumably, his conclusion  or is it a genetic [information] code defect or mutation of disease and death? Mutations are degradations in genetic [information] code yet evolution theory is they essentially result in new speciation! 2/ There is a very pronounced materialism, naturalism and -- yes, even for an alleged big picture astrophysicist  small-minded reductionism bias. Either there is ONLY matter and energy or is there is matter, energy and mind -- i.e. God, Mastermind and the biggest picture? True knowledge empowers, like energy. 3/ Either AMAZIN evolution is true  matter came alive and morphed into the natural miracle of 100, dozen ton+  whales  or amazing GRACE is true: man is fallen, biased, debased, shallow, twisted and micro-minded but saved and transformed [Romans 12:2] by Christs work on the cross. CROSS referenced reality is Christianity.  The theory of evolution is real   it exists  but God is true.  Man is real, too, but untrue, needing salvation from the hell-bent world and worldly.  4/ Whom has the bias? Is science vs. superstitious religion true or true science AND PC scientism  vs true [limited] science and a super natural true God: Mastermind or Creator and re-Creator to resurrection? The latter transcends the worldly, PC superimposed superficiality.  5/ There is absolutely no awareness of the highly deceptive S-matrix: Satan, [fallen short] sin and worldly systems [including PC scientism]. Why? The reductionism bias?  Is there no [dark or lite, superficial] evil spirit vs. Holy Spirit dimension and conflict, a war in the heart of the mind? That would be in ones emotions and e-motive and problem defining and solving intelligence vs secularized, defective intellectualism.  6/ At one point the narrator said the Big Bang -- without a banger-God -- happened so fast there was no time for a divine presence  and, thus, there is no god.  God is in eternity, outside time but impacts events in time.  From eternity, time is like a ruler and there can be divine interventions. 7/ Theoretical physicists seem to have this almost addiction- [sin?] like, blinding  preoccupation with matter in super-small, sub-atomic particle [formation] physics.  Are they career$ bia$ed? God is about vocation or calling.  What about information and disinformation [deception and lies] of the S-matrix? Information is everywhere, much trivial or not accessible [God] due to the S-matrix.  Information is instantaneous, faster than light.  What about in formation or organization, a function of consciousness of a Mastermind? The DVD is totally oblivious due to a profound bias yet organization  and counter-intelligent human chaos --  is a key dynamic of our universe.  8/ The film seems to ascribe the creation event  without a Creator -- as a sort of [perfect] quantum wave collapse as at the end and there are infinite, mostly failed universes. For an effect [the universe] there must be a cause or causal agent. That is science.  Spontaneity is not science; creation is super natural.  9/ The string [you along] theory segment is laughable.  Ten dimensions to reality? Really? No common  all true  sense? We are supposed to believe [as true} that there is some super sub-atomic dance of particles [displayed in living color] creating reality? 10/ There must have been a couple dozen screen displays  of Steven Hawkings Grand Design during the program. Why? Did we miss or forget the title? Why the similar eye-above-glasses shot many times? What about insight which sees the invisible vs. eyesight for the visible? 11/ At one point reality is deemed only personal yet this thesis is that Hawkings is THE reality. 12/ Conventional science is about proof, not theoretic speculation as much of this amalgam of science and PC scientism. True [singular] God, not [fallen] man made up religion is about revelation. You cannot prove the existence of God, who is revealed. 12/ We are to have faith in science? What is the scientific answer to human addiction, with denial, politicization, murder, war, chaos and destruction? Does sin and evil even exist from Hawkings [restricted]  scientific perspective? 13/ The string [you along] theory results in an infinite number of universes, with different rules or sciences. It used to be called PARALLEL universes with an infinite number of yous with an infinite number of others collapsing the quantum wave into infinite specific manifest actions.  From a Christian, true or upright resurrection perceptive the singular Kingdom of God is upright or PERPENDICULAR to the fallen, biased, debased, shallow, twisted and micro-minded worldly. You have but one life [in time] but have eternal life: with or apart from eternal God and Thy perfect kingdom come, fully manifest:  The eternal In Formation [Organization] Age[less]. 13/ Cited scientists Newton and Maxwell are know to have godly Christian beliefs. God wants to us to more FULLY understand His creation and the human plight.  Why did Hawking depart from a couple of his heroes? In summary an almost worthless, shallow thesis of the anti-thesis or Anti-Christ vs. Christ, the true thesis.",1427846400,,5435,5.210586881472957

5888209,4,B00E3PLMS2,"I watched Stephen Hawking's Grand Design with an open mind and I learned a lot actually. What surprised me was Stephen Hawking's declaration that philosophy was dead. To me it is very much alive. He then went on to philosophize about the meaning of life and concluded this: ""Meaning itself is simply another piece of the model of reality that we each build inside our own brain.""

Personally I think the meaning or purpose of life is to love God and to be loved in return. I did not find much about God in this presentation. Stephen Hawking also has a very casual view of free will. He sees it simply as choices we make. He does not get into depths about evil and good and how free will would not exist without evil.

He also has some interesting views about the nature of reality. I found the section on the table leaving the room when you are not there to be sort of comical. Of course the table is still there. But it added some humor.

This ends with contemplations about string theory which I actually felt I knew a little about. What I noticed mostly after watching this visually stunning show was that the world seemed more beautiful. It was as if all my five senses had been turned on full blast. Even peeling an apple was an interesting experience.

I just wish Stephen Hawking believed that God wants a personal relationship with us. Otherwise life has little meaning. This program also deals a little with evolution. Stephen Hawking talks about the brain being so wonderful but he doesn't seem to believe that God designed it that way. I feel Stephen Hawking is missing out on a whole other world in regards to the spiritual dimension.

5888210,4,B00E3PLMS2,Divided into three sections or headings. Each easy to digest. Each thought provoking. No preaching.,1404950400,8,99,5.666666666666667
5888211,5,B00E3PLMS2,"WOW, this is a DVD that will blow your mind. I knew that Stephen Hawking was a genius, but this just solidified it for me. In watching this he brought up ideas and principles that I had never considered. I for one know that I learned a great deal in watching this and I know that you will too. Be ready to be taken on a journey that will open your eyes and your mind!

8600680,5,B00E3PLMS2,"The best of Stephen Hawking.  An explanation of science and rational thought trumping religion and philosophy as we proceed into the 21st century.  Wonderful explanations of current hypotheses of the universe(s), their formation, and inflation theory giving us an insight into relativity, quantum theory, M theory, and multiverses.  Makes one feel so small and insignificant in such a magnificent and awe inspiring way. Should be a required read.",1458691200,,446,5.529411764705882
