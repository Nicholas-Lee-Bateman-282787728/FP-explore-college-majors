8530317,5,B008U0XMXY,"For anyone looking, the description says to note that The Proprietor is in PAL format only.  I just ordered The Proprietor DVD from Australia (October 2014) on eBay and it's in NTSC format and region free (region 0), and plays just fine in my U.S. (NTSC/Region 1) DVD player and Mac.

Same cover art.  Dated 1996.  Manufactured by Shock Entertainment.  The number under the bar code is 5021456184248.

If you really do have a PAL-only copy you can convert it to NTSC with a program like Aimersoft Video Converter Ultimate.",1412985600,5,522,4.7444444444444445

8530320,1,B008U0XMXY,"At this price, over $400.00, I was expecting all their best movies. The Amazon site did not list the movies in the collection so you don't know what you are getting. Boy, was I disappointed! Where was ""A Room With A View"" and ""The Remains of The Day"", two of their most famous films? I was expecting a complete retrospective of their work and got the dredges of their early and lesser later work. I could have just bought each disk I wanted for $20.00 and saved over $300.00. What a rip off. Never again. I consider it Amazon's fault for not listing the films in the collection on their site. I am very unhappy.",1351296000,33,611,4.321739130434783
