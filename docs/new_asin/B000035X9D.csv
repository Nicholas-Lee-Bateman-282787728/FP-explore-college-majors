7916654,5,B000035X9D,"When I bought this video I only knew I wanted to learn how to throw a castnet. Man, did this video pay off. I had previously been attempting to throw a friend's 4 foot bait net. It was only a ball of nylon after each cast. After getting, watching and applying the information from this video I was immediately throwing an 8 foot bait net. Two or three days practice and the net was sailing out in a perfect circle every time. I then got a 10 foot mullet net and was throwing it perfectly everytime. I cannot give too much credit to this video. I will relate one story. Shortly after I got this video I was standing on a dock with 3 white booted local fishermen. The fishermen along the Florida panhandle are serious guys. They told me to throw my 10 foot mullet net. They would evaluate my performance before I could fish along side them. I cast out my net. They all saw how effortless I threw the net as it opened into a beautiful circle. They asked me where I learned to throw so well. I confessed it was in my backyard in central Georgia, BUT, mostly from ""The Art of Castnet Throwing"" by Wheeler Enterprises. They all agreed I could throw with them that morning and asked where they could get a copy of that video.",1239840000,,1218,4.254310344827586
7916655,5,B000035X9D,"A great instructional video!! This video covers throwing all size nets. It also covers how to look at your practice throws and identify problem areas.
He covers catching bait from a dock, a boat, and standing in the water.
I would have to say if you intend to throw a cast net, or even if you already are decent with one, this video is well worth the money.
The instructor Warren Wheeler deserves a big pat on the back for making a video which simplifies the art of castnet throwing.",1218585600,,483,4.377777777777778
