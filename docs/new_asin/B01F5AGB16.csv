8760149,5,B01F5AGB16,"I LOVE that I read I review that said it DOES play in North American players!!Doro NEVER disappoints, and on Blu-Ray...yes please!!Longtime fan from the beginning!!I was stationed in Germany from '84-'88 and saw Warlock in small clubs in '84 and '85 and even back then SO fan friendly. I met her many times before she was 'big' and now still meeting her when she comes my way, loves when I show her pics from her old Warlock shows back when she was in Warlock. Saw her open the '86 Monsters of Rock in Nurnberg, Germany(actually, at that time it was West Germany)and I was front row and they rocked SO hard!!When Bon Jovi came out next we were booing him...and other things I won't mention, but they were just such poseurs, and sugar sweet, pop metal, etc;,hey I was only 23 and wouldn't do it now,but they weren't well received after the mighty Doro led Warlock!!)) she was SO much better than him, blew him off the stage. She takes so much of her time signing for everyone!!Truly classy and the undisputed Queen of metal!!!SO much great stuff here, I'm loving it!!",1503360000,,1066,4.528497409326425
