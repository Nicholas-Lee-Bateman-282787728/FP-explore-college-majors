8082453,3,B000B6KRC4,"If you want to watch the big Ronnie trainning some basic exercises, you will see it on this DVD. But don't expect a full documental interview or something like Arnold's first movie. This is very simple and basic. Looks like somebody take a domestic camera and start recording Ronnie on his trainning. Anyway you will see him doing what 99,9999% of us will never can do :)",1310342400,,371,4.552238805970149
8082454,5,B000B6KRC4,"My first Ronnie Coleman DVD and really enjoying it and watched it a couple times already. Inspirational in how he enjoys his life and how bodybuilding fits with it.  He is old school in his approach of powering thru basic exercises to get the job done in the gym.  His eating is typical lots of chicken, but surprised at all the BBQ sauce and the french fries and ketchup, but with his workouts he's burning the calories to handle it.  I want to get some of his other DVD's now this one was a blast.",1265328000,,499,4.231578947368421

8082457,5,B000B6KRC4,"This video may not be instructional but definitely motivatinal. Ronnie is a definite lock for Bodybuilding HOF. His freakish size and unimaginable strength will make any people who are or aren't bodybuilding fans look in awe. What makes Big Ron so special is his friendly demeanor and great down to earth attitude. He is not the type of person who rest on his laurels but a person who is focused on being the best and while keeping himself grounded. On top of that, he is a funny guy with simple country type quotes. ""Ain't nuthin but a peanut"". ""Light Weight BABY!!"" ""Nuthin' to it but to do it.""",1193097600,4,597,4.537037037037037
8082458,4,B000B6KRC4,"If you are looking for an instructional DVD to help guide you towards building an impressive physique, look elsewhere.  If you are not into bodybuilding then this DVD will probably not appeal to you at all.

However, if you are into bodybuilding, and if you just want to see one of the greatest Mr. Olympias breaking down barriers in the gym, if you are looking for something to make your jaw drop and have you questioning your own definition of ""intensity,"" then get this movie.

Clearly there will always be debate in our circles as to what defines an intense workout, what defines a good physique, or even what defines a bodybuilder.  We can debate intensities and volume parameters, high carb versus low carb with refeeds, or how to best develop the outer sweep of our thighs all day long.  But there is not much debate when it comes to the amazement most feel when watching some of Ronnie's training scenes in this movie.

To be a little more specific, you'll get to see some of Ronnie's day-to-day activities.  You'll see him driving his nice cars, getting a massage, cooking food, and going to Black-Eyed-Pea every day.  Some of this might get a little bland, but this DVD is worth the price for the training scenes alone in my opinion.

Again, for those not too interested in bodybuilding or for those looking for instructions, this is probably something you should skip.  But for those of us who are into the sport, this is, in my humble opinion, one of those DVDs you write down in your ""must have"" list.",1180742400,21,1514,4.594795539033457
