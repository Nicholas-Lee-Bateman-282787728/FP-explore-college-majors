1392782,4,B0000542C4,"This is another example of a product delivering a pretty good movie but a very good DVD.  ""Rated X"" is watchable and engaging, but ultimately doesn't add anything new to the often-seen story of would-be movie moguls finally making it big but then being brought down by the excesses of the high life (in this case, cocaine).  Of course, if that's what really happened to the Mitchell Brothers, I guess viewers can't complain much about seeing it all before.  In any event, what puts this DVD over the top are the bonus materials: we get several generous interview segments with the Mitchell Brothers' famous discovery, Marilyn Chambers, who elaborates on the action in the movie (no pun intended), and equally generous interview segments with an assistant district attorney integrally involved with all the legal troubles the Mitchell Brothers had in their 1970's heyday.  Between the movie and extras, one gets a comprehensive and satisfyingly entertaining snapshot of the characters in question and the overall mood of the era.",1120521600,3,1028,5.101190476190476
1392783,2,B0000542C4,"This movie could have been handled so much better.  Doesn't help that the brothers Sheen wore terrible bald wigs which were so noticeable in parts it made the film so silly.  Just keep your eye out for the really shiney moments when the wigs look so plastic.  That aside, what is wrong with this film. Besides the fact it did nothing at the box office, the film just doesn't have enough punch to pull you in. I really felt nothing for any of the characters involved, and you need to be able to do this to appreciate a film.
The Sheen brothers team up again for this film (remember ""Men at Work""?). Someone must have told them that they make a good combination, but I am afraid that this partnership couldn't save this film.",1077580800,,723,4.380597014925373
1392784,5,B0000542C4,"I saw it on cable and knew something about them but I didn't know that they were pioneers of the porn industry.  They put a soft-core actress Marylin Chambers on the map.  The brothers Artie and Jim Mitchell went through ropes with the government and the mob to produce their movies.  Their personal lives are another story.  Jim was a bachelor while his brother was twice married and divorced.  Jim Mitchell was the brother who kept things afloat despite his drug use.  His brother Artie, was into parties, guns, and sex.  After the courts decided to end porn films, they went into the live sex business.  However, Jim needed to get away which did him some good.  He had to kick his drug habit once and for all.  Meanwhile Artie who had a second wife and two sons was still destructive to himself.
Throughout the movie it was Jim who was his brother's keeper which he could no longer do.  It's one thing to help a family member who will help himself.  It's another when that member is destroying himself intently while hurting others around him.  Artie felt like he was always in his brother's shadow.  Jim, as always is there to protect him.  Both Sheen and Estevez, real-life brothers, do a good job at portraying the characters and their attitudes.  It is a good role for the both of them because Estevez has his head above the water like Jim, while Charlie Sheen has been known for being reckless and has a past drug history.  This was a good role for the both of them.",1074384000,2,1474,4.481203007518797
1392785,4,B0000542C4,"I stumbled across this movie one late night. Normally dramas are not my bag. I like Sci-fi and action/adventure what can I say. But I found myself drawn into the film, particually by Sheen's preformance. The film does have it's shortcommings. But overall it is a stark and very upfront portrayal of the people and events.
  It shows how easy it is for things to spiral out of control and how guys who had everything could never be satisfied. Give it a go. You may be surprised with what you find.",1013126400,3,496,4.43956043956044
1392786,5,B0000542C4,"Another fine performance from Martin's young men. A very fine, convincing performance by Charlie and Emilio, well a perfect performance as always. A directorial triumph from Emilio, fresh from his Vietnam epic 'The War At Home', Emilio projects the life of the Mitchell brothers with great verve and vigour, and not a little gusto.
Glad to see Emilio and Charlie starring together after such classic's as Young Guns and Men at Work.",999129600,,432,5.013888888888889
1392787,5,B0000542C4,Great film by Emilio. For the budget he had it turned out nicely. One of Charlie's greatest performances.

1392788,5,B0000542C4,"Once you get past the allure of pornography, Rated X is the true story of two troubled brothers who strike it rich in every respect (money and women) in the earliest incarnation of the modern day porn world.  Loosely based on the intense biography, X Rrated, Rated X is also the directorial debut of Emilio Estevez.  Now before you laugh, Estevez has a strong command of his vision and crafts a startiling, dark world where a pair of brothers fall into drugs, sex, and money and slowly unravel into despair and mental illness.
Charlie Sheen gives the performance of his career as Artie Mitchell, a drug addled, womanizing, porn producer who is eventually gunned down by his brother Jim (Estevez).
'Rated X' shows the earliest struggles of the porn industry against censorship and obsenity and its triumph into the mainstream with the production of 'Deep Throat' and the Mitchell Brothers' classic 'Behind the Green Door.'  Eventually, amid the atmosphere of drugs and organized crime the industry falls from the lofty heights of those seminal porn films into a mockery of jokes and sex.
This is an excellent companion piece to PT Anderson's 'Boogie Nights.'  Where as 'Boogie' deals more with the personalities that existed in the hey day of porn, 'Rated X' gives us the struggle with authorities over obsenity, the triumph of the porn film with a story and the decline into kitch, cliche, and video.
Sheen and Estevez's performances are strong and vivid, especially in the sceens together where it is obvious (based on Sheen's drug problems) that the brother's are pulling from emotions they have felt in their lives to add realism to the lives of Jim and Artie Mitchell.",980208000,26,1672,4.897526501766785

1392800,5,B0000542C4,This is a good film meaning its choppy and has a feel like a real porno from the early 70s.

1392807,5,B0000542C4,"Jim Mitchell's whole life, he has rescured his baby brother, Artie. Artie misbehaves in school around age 12, and Jim runs to save him from a paddling. He tells the princable dad does not beleive in violence.

Artie needs a lot of help, because dad is a vengeful man. He gives Artie the belt. Days after, dad takes both boys on a collection run, with a shot gun.

Jim had the edge over Artie, and in the late 1960s, he is in UCLA film school, learning to make avant-gaurde films. Artie wonders the country, looking for industrial jobs.

Being tight, big brother invites little brother to join his film crew. Alligned with the times, Jim has big, artsy ambitions.  Problem is, no money.

To solve this, the Mitchell brothers decide, over a joint,  to make skin filcks to finanace the art films. The art films, of course, never materialize. The porn does, and the boys soon find themselves getting arrested.

This is all great fun. This is the era of Lenny Bruce, key parties. Playboy was showing the stuff downstairs. Bill Kunzler was defending Jim Morrison. Oh! Calcutta and Hair were big hits. Mainstreem hits. Hell, Midnight Cowboy just won best picutre with an X.

Artie has an idea: why not make a nudie art film--something that will make money and suit Jims avant gaurde ambitions. Behind The Green Door was born, and Artie was directing. But Artie does not know his lence from his wine bottle, so Jim has to start from scratch.

Dispite another arrest in trial, Green Door his a smash, and soon, that's millionaire Mitchel to you. Both Mitchels marry their sweathearts and start work on an even bigger project: a porn bible epic.

Trouble is, the 60s joints have become 70s cocaine. Every day. With morning eggs bacon OJ and coffee. With the white powder magic, any idea you have is brillant: opening a pepsi, eating mounds of food, or spending millions on a Cecil B. Damille skinfest.

Sodom and Gamhora bombs. But the brothers still have their mansions,  theatre, prodcution company, and drugs. By now, the 70s is turning to the 80s, both guys are too strung out to make films. The 60s art venue becomes the 80s strip joint.

Jim can handle coke, and eventually, quits, with no help. Artie can't, and he gets incresingly viloent. He takes up his father's love for guns, and  beats his wife when she shakes hands with her tennis teacher. He also has the bright idea to drag his kids deep into the ocean on a platic raft, and almost kills them. Guess who saves the three.

Artie tries to stop with Jims loving help, but can't. He is GONE! He walks , a beast in a death fog: rants and raves, points his guns at family, frineds, anyone who impeedes his own destruction. Soon, he gets the idea that Jim his a worse addict than he is--Jim still smokes Morlboros. He calls his ex, his mom, and Jim, ranting that Jim must die.

Jim walks into Arties house, shooting and killing Artie.

The Sheen brothers are perfect at capturing the dynamics at work. Artie resents Jim's help and compadence, and Jim can't help but making a life of saving Artie. They are  so emeshed, it is any wonder one killed the other?

The period set design is spectacular: 60s and 70s interiors are exactly what I remember houses looking like when I was tiny. There is hot orange in 1968 and cool blue in 1974. There are no larva lamps or stereotypical devices to hammer you that this is the time period. Everything is organic: you are THERE.

Emelio Evestazes directed this. He uses artsey tricks, but keeps them to a minimum, and only uses them when they fit: a shaking camera at the end to convey Artie's coke-induced mental break. They work well. He has a feel for time, people and place, and nails it.

I wonder why Martin did not play dad. Too busy being president?",1249344000,5,3745,4.543154761904762
1392808,3,B0000542C4,"Emilio Estavez directed this, but one wonders why.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that a movie about two porn movie directors is not going to win any Academy Awards.  What was Emilio thinking?  You can play it as tragedy.  You certainly can't make heroes of these guys.  I guess what he was thinking was this was a part of America from the sixties to the nineties in the twentieth century--this was the reality and let's tell the truth.  But somebody else might say, why bother?

Most critics and viewers would call this a prize turkey, but...but is there some redeeming social value?  Charlie Sheen and Estavez star as the brothers Mitchell, two entrepreneurial guys who stumble from the free love scene of the sixties in San Francisco to the cash cow of the first widely distributed porn movies, including the infamous ""Behind the Green Door.""  Maybe there is a kind of free speech angle here, with the porno boys fighting the good fight against censorship and Big Brother.  On the other hand, there is a didactic tale here about how success corrupts and how sex, drugs and rock and roll--forget the rock and roll; this is almost pure sex and drugs--how sex and drugs may lead you to make a movie called ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" which may suggest that you ought to be starring it in.

Charlie Sheen is very good and so is Estavez.  His direction is also not bad.  The movie moves right along and the degeneration of the brothers is well expressed.  Megan Ward had a chance in a supporting role here, but she failed miserably, possibly because how could she feel any connection with a role that made her the quasi-tolerant, quasi-suffering wife of a man who makes his living pandering to lust (and indulging his own) while smoking, drinking and snorting anything he can get his hands on?

Not pretty.  However, I wouldn't be surprised if someday in the distant future, long after I am gone, in some social science class at say Cal Berkeley this movie is played as augmenting an anthropological study of a certain segment of our population in the later part of the 20th century.  The students can see this as a film documenting the moral corruption of a nation following Vietnam and the Nixon administration, perhaps even anticipating the moral corruption we see today.

But I would advise you to skip this unless you are a big Emilio Estavez fan, in which case this is a must see, or if you are a Charlie Sheen fan, and then it is worth seeing because this is one of his better performances--and it's amusing to see these guys in their bald domes and their side burns and authentic seventies attire.  To be honest, I've seen people win Academy Awards who weren't half as good as Sheen was. Naturally this won nothing.",1178496000,,2720,4.617463617463618

7930644,3,B0000542C4,"Seemingly inspired by the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>, Rated-X is the ""true story"" of the porn producing Mitchell brothers, following their rise and (drug-induced) fall from X-rated filmmaking success.

Rated-X is set mostly in San Francisco during the 1970s and 1980s. However, this low-budget made-for-cable TV movie (Showtime) was shot in Canada. The film suffers as a result. When you try and recapture an era -- the mood of a particular time and place -- it helps to include iconic, or at least authentic, locations in your film. (I mean, in addition to the stock footage establishing shots.) But the Canadian streets and buildings in Rated-X look dull and nondescript. (Well, they couldn't very well include memorable Canadian streets and buildings.)

Compare the Canadian ""San Francisco"" in Rated-X to the real San Francisco in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk/dp/B001QUF3SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk</a>. Or to the real L.A. in Boogie Nights. You'll see how authentic locations can strengthen a film's atmosphere and story.

Apart from the unconvincing locales, I didn't find Rated-X's story to be particularly interesting, nor its characters emotionally engaging. They held my interest in a cursory sense (i.e., as long as it was already playing, I might as well watch). But the film was not particularly memorable, despite all the sex and drugs, the betrayals and violence.

Granted, I mainly got this film because Canadian actress Nicole de Boer was in it, and I admired her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cube/dp/6305238065/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cube</a>&nbsp;(one of the most original horror films of the 1990s -- don't bother with the sequels). de Boer has but a small role in Rated-X, her character flatly-written and uninteresting.",1476144000,,1983,6.388059701492537

While Charlie Sheen gives an animated portrayal of a man spinning out of control on drugs and booze, there's nothing here we haven't seen in a dozen other, better movies.  Emilio Estevez's direction never rises above the mediocre and his acting is worse.  His attempts toward the end of the film to dramatize his characters' disintegrating connection with reality by resorting to arty camera tricks are strictly film school year one ... and briefly give the impression the disc may be damaged.
