And I mean the guy can sing too!  But then when a friend of her's is betrothed to another man, her friends fiance falls for Snow Maiden.  So can Snow Maiden win the heart of Lel the shepard and get her friend's lustful, annoying fiance off her back?  Heck I'm not telling you, you have to watch this movie and see for yourself!  Highly reconmended for music, Russian movie lovers and lovers of Russian fairy tales!",1196553600,4,589,4.407407407407407
1800897,5,B0000714AU,Another gorgeous Russian film - full of beautiful folk music and a breathtaking village set. The story is so famous in Russia that both Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky set it to music.  The poor Snow Maiden is a very tragic figure who willingly dies to feel the emotion of love but the coda is quite upbeat. Very Russian.,1105660800,16,321,4.631578947368421
1800898,4,B0000714AU,"As a playwright Ostrovsky is the Russian Shakespeare. Here we have something akin to ""A Midsummernight's Dream,"" only with superb Russian folk singing thrown into the mix. Yes, it all can seem very stilted to western audiences, but remember that this is pretty important theater being filmed. Wonderful atmospherics and direction reminiscent of Bergman and Pasolini make this a lot of fun. I just wish the soundtrack were available.",1076371200,24,432,5.27536231884058
7974025,3,B0000714AU,"There are English subtitles to go along with the Russian audio. Just open the settings drop-down menu. There are some good elements to this film, but we thought it did not stand up to the test of time, and we watch a fair amount of Russian-made films and series. Most of the Russian film/TV content on Amazon is hit and miss, either 1-2 stars or 4-5 stars, but  this one hangs somewhere in the middle so we give it 3 stars.",1504828800,,423,4.222222222222222

7974029,4,B0000714AU,"Very satisfying entry into the Russian Fairy Tale/Christmas genre.  As usual, the slices of Russian village life are in evidence, and you can almost feel what it was like in such a small village.  I particularly enjoyed the sets - great reflections of the Norse heritage of the White Russians.  While the sets were very good, there was not nearly as much color and special effects as I've come to expect from Russian Fairy Tales.  I withheld one star only because others of this type are so much more grand in visual style.  Certainly worth your family's time - especially if you enjoy other cultures.",1479254400,2,601,4.685714285714286
