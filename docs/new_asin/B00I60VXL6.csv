8639548,4,B00I60VXL6,"This is a good gift for someone who loves to grill. The chicken was very moist and had a great flavor. I also enjoyed the fact that the chicken could cool down right on it. On the other side though, it was a little tricky to clean. Parts of the chicken fat stuck to the bottom.
I also loved the brushes. Having a set of 3 makes is nice because I like to continue to baste throughout the cook.",1437004800,3,392,3.9746835443037973
8639549,5,B00I60VXL6,I already had this on DVD so I was just upgrading to Blu Ray. I liked both discs already. Lou Reed was one of my favorite musicians of all times.,1396828800,,145,3.8666666666666667
