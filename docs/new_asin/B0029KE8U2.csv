8357833,3,B0029KE8U2,"The acting in the film is wildly variable. Marmo, and old warhorses like Torres and Costanzo do quite well in their parts. The scenes of Sebi handling his mother's death, and holding her, then nothing, in that bed, from an overhead shot, is quite emotionally revealing, and shows Marmo and Cistone at their best, and one just wishes that all of the emotions and direction of the film had been as stellar. There are some good supporting performances, starting with the few brief scenes of Cavalieri's Joey, whose warmth, charisma, and good looks make him a presence onscreen. How this actor has not made it in a bigger way is beyond me. The same could be said for Fioravanti's Donna, who goes from a smartass bitch to a grieving friend and woman of some insight. And it's not because the role is written that way, but the looks and glances that Fioravanti imbues her character with. The third unexpectedly good performance comes from Pupello's emotionally desperate Grace, who appears in only two brief scenes, but nails an archetype while also putting real pity into her character. The rest of the cast is quite mediocre, to be generous- with the worst offenders being Madio's stale Jimmy Boy, and Jackson as Maddy's father, giving absolutely no life to his curmudgeon. The film score, by Michael Sherwood and Carl Saunders, is top notch, and not too schmaltzy nor too obvious in giving away emotional cues, and well scored by Marmo's wife, Wendy. The cinematography, by Florian Stadler and Daniel Stilling is good throughout, with a few moments of high quality, starting right from the fire at Papo's, which plays under the credits, and economically propels the characters' diaspora westward. The film also suffers from, especially in its first half, too much narration. Sebi is not Woody Allenesque in his powers of observation, and more annoying Daniel Stern from The Wonder Years, and cutting this by 30-40% would have helped, but the overall screenplay, by Marmo, ranges from solid to good.

  West Of Brooklyn is not a film that will change one's life. It lacks the artistry to be great, and too much of it follows the banal paths of yore. But, at its best, the film subverts many expectations, and showcases Marmo as a genuinely multitalented artist: actor, producer, screenwriter....but NOT poet! It is the sort of work that I, on a personal level, like stumbling upon, as I have with a number of self published books I've reviewed. It is also a film that aptly shows the seeds for later potential, and on that basis, as well the others mentioned, it's worth viewing.",1340236800,,2575,4.834467120181406
8357834,5,B0029KE8U2,"This is the kind of independent movie that doesn't get much attention, but is a gem for those who search for it in the far corners of video rental shops.

It follows a lovable Brooklyn Italian-American family with a tasty pizza shop out to California for a new start, and maybe some day an upscale restaurant.

To tell the truth, the pizza place drew me in with friendly staff and what must be very tasty slices of pizza. My wife Chris and I were almost tempted to stop the DVD and run out for some pizza, but somehow we stuck with the story.

The focal character, a young poet-pizza chef Sebi struggles with his secret goal of being a famous poet and his love and loyalty to the family. Also in California, making himself presentable to a very beautiful Matty and her wealthy but inconsiderate father.

There are many bumps in the road for the family in California and one especially difficult, but you will want to stay with them through it all and hope for their happiness and fulfillment.

So check it out with someone who shares your quest for a quality movie. But try to have some of your own pizza on hand for a slice now and then.  Ummm good.

8357835,5,B0029KE8U2,"West of Brooklyn is a sweet film with a wonderful cast. The story will make you laugh and cry as Sebi - perfectly portrayed by star and screenwriter Ronnie Marmo - deals with love and loss. If you've ever felt like a fish out of water while events happening around you left you confused, lost or angry, this is your film. It's also a gentle love story for your romantic side, LOL.",1255132800,,380,4.291666666666667
8357836,5,B0029KE8U2,"I saw this film last year at it's premiere in Los Angeles and it's just wonderful, heartwarming, funny, and sad all at once.  It's one of those small independent films I really hope fans gravitate to. It's a wonderful story, great performances, and great talent. I loved the story. I felt like I knew the cast for years. I can't say enough about this movie. I've been following Ronnie Marmo for many years, and I think this is his BEST work yet. There are a couple of things I can say about it. You will cry, laugh, get angry and feel as if these people are your family. It is as intense as it is funny. Joe Mantegna a pleasent surprise in this film, newcomer Natalia Livingston was sweet and gorgeous, and of course Balthazar Getty from Brothers and Sisters in a small role. Great movie and performances all around.",1247356800,3,816,4.44
