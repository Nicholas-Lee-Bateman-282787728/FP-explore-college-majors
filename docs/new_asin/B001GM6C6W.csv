3615449,4,B001GM6C6W,"Fun if you can take a joke - this follows a ""shell"" of Verne's masterpiece.  My quibble is the personalities of the adult characters were not the same from episode to episode.  Mama is tender,loving, understanding and helpless for three episodes, then a raging banshee for the next three.  Neb, the former slave, is all helpful then decides to pick sides.  Killing off major characters so close to the beginning of the series was puzzling (contract issues?).  But a fun series  - kinda like Lost in Space in Tahiti.",1246579200,10,515,4.730337078651686
3615450,4,B001GM6C6W,"Very good series, no sexual scenes, and no cursing that I recall.  However, in the end it's about the triump of the 'human' spirit.  Was disappointing in that regard.  Because the truth is that Nemo is right all along, at least in the real world.  To bad the writers were wrong.

Alan Scarfe is excellent, as always.",1240444800,5,316,4.473684210526316

8305983,1,B001GM6C6W,"Jules Verne's ""The Mysterious Island"" is deservedly a classic.  This TV series is a mess.  In the first episode we find the following: a bunch of characters only vaguely resembling Verne's escape from the Confederate forces in a helium balloon - before helium was even known to exist! (The first free helium on Earth was extracted in 1895 by Sir William Ramsay).  They then get blown into the Pacific, and land on an island that looks nothing like a Pacific island, unknowingly observed by a white-bearded North European masquerading as Captain Nemo.  It seems the authors of this TV fiasco didn't bother to read the book, which explicitly identifies Nemo as an Indian prince.  And it's downhill from there.",1380240000,,707,4.907563025210084
8305984,4,B001GM6C6W,"Make it so!

Its just amazing how interesting this is. But of course its basicly a serial ad while its a lot of fun....
For some it may get a bit slow after a few episodes.

8305985,5,B001GM6C6W,"I liked it a lot at the begining when it matched almost exactly the action from the book, but was supprised later with additional action parts created by the movie makers that do not match the book. It also leaves the audience guessing where is the end of the journey. Is there a second series to it?
Gave is 5 stars though for what it is.",1355443200,,339,4.151515151515151
8305986,4,B001GM6C6W,"22 episodes, 16.5 hours, no special features

Location - great
Acting - some actors very good, others acceptable

When I was growing up I would always watch the 1961 movie Mysterious Island whenever it was on television.  This series bears almost no resemblance to that production.  There are no giant animals for instance.  I guess the movie was designed for kids and teenagers.  This series is geared more for adults.  There is no nudity, cursing, or graphic violence but the story lines are just more suited to adults.  Some of the themes are pretty dark.

Captain Nemo is sort of a voyeur.  He has viewing and listening devices planted all over the island.  He uses them to observe the psychology and sociological interactions of the castaways as a scientist would study animal behavior.

Some modern sentiments are transposed onto the 1860's characters but the story does not proceed in a predictable manner.  When one of the original main characters dies, you realize you are not watching a typical television series.  There is a continuity to the episodes.  Characters and their relationships actually evolve as the series proceeds.  It does not always adhere to the now typical political correctness.  Some of the indigenous people are good but others are liars and thieves.  It is refreshing to see everyone portrayed as real people with both good and bad traits.

The final episode did not really bring closure to the story.  I guess they were hoping to be renewed for another season.  In spite of that it worked for me.  You are just left to your own imagination as to how you think the story would have ended.

I would recommend the series to anyone who likes adventure movies.  For me, it was like watching a very long miniseries.  The price (currently under $14) is very reasonable.",1346198400,2,1796,4.828947368421052
8305987,3,B001GM6C6W,"MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1995), 22 episodes, based on the classic novel by Jules Verne.  This series features a capable cast--the *lovely* Collette Stevenson in particular--and some beautiful scenery (the show was filmed in New Zealand).  The DVD released by Echo Bridge has quite a few digital artifacts & pixelation--in other words, a typical Echo Bridge DVD.  This series was ""okay""--not super-great, but neither is it super-bad.  There are several other ""castaway"" drama series (all of which were produced after MYSTERIOUS ISLAND)--""Peter Benchley's AMAZON"", ""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE LOST WORLD"" and (of course) ""LOST""--all of these shows are available on DVD and are heads-and-shoulders above MYSTERIOUS ISLAND in every way imaginable.  MYSTERIOUS ISLAND is a slightly-above average series, enjoyable for the most part but (perhaps) not ""essential"" viewing.  MYSTERIOUS ISLAND--Starring Alan Scarfe, C. David Johnson, Colette Stevenson, Stephen Lovatt, Gordon Michael Woolvett, Andy Marshall and John Bach as ""Captain Nemo"".

8305988,4,B001GM6C6W,"Great serialized plot, although somewhat different to Jules Verne's novel.
Capt Nemo is presented as a hidden recluse, toying with the island's castaways, using them as subjects for his rather pointless twisted experiments, all recorded with introductory phrase ""Modification of human behaviour experiment number ...""
There is no escape from the island in the last episode, only betrayal, as the plot diverges as far as possible from the novel, possibly to pave the way for a second season. Though none was made.
Alan Scarf plays Capt Cyrus Harding to perfection, only a few years before his great performance in time travel sci-fi series ""Seven Days.""
If you're a Jules Verne fan, get these great prints, and enjoy.",1253664000,5,716,5.128205128205129
