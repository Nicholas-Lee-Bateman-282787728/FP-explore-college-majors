I felt like a little girl again watching these DVD's with my dad.  The quality was great and the memories even better!",1417392000,3,273,4.313725490196078
8050427,5,B0007Q6P9C,Great show. Lots of corny jokes. Buck Owens and Roy Clark with their pickin and grinnin segment always kept you on your toes. Also a lot of the country stars and some rock stars of that era appeared in the Hee Haw series. It's always pleasing to see them again. If you like good clean comedy check out the Hee Haw series.,1413244800,,321,4.193548387096774

8050430,5,B0007Q6P9C,Our Red Hatters group decided as a theme for next years reunion to be Hee Haw.  When I received the DVD I played it.  I had forgotten how funny and silly the show was.  We will have a good time dressing like the stars in the show.  We are even trying to find a Hound dog to put on stage.,1307491200,,287,3.7333333333333334
8050431,2,B0007Q6P9C,"The image used in the ad was NOT the item I received. I thought I purchased a used HEE HAW DVD, but instead it was a very used library copy loaded with security devices, library stickers, etc. I planned on giving it as a gift and had to make up a ridiculous excuse why it looked the way it did (I trimmed away all of the ugly labels) when I eventually gave it to its recipient. While I like the contents of the DVD, everything else was no good.",1291420800,,444,4.0
