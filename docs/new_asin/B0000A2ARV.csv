7995456,4,B0000A2ARV,"This video is a bit different than the norm.  Instead of just showing techniques and movement, it sets a relaxing mood so you don't feel that your in the middle of a classroom or having a text book flashed at you.  I quite liked this approach probably, like most, because one of my primary reasons for massage was stress reduction/relaxation.  It is also done in a chapter formation for each body part so you can just work on a body part.  While the video is ambitious in trying to cover all the body parts, the techniques shown were more than sufficient for my use-advanced beginner/intermediate.  The rest of our group, who were beginners, were also able to follow along easily.

I would recommend this as a first or second step into the world of acupressure, massage or alternative health.  It will not replace taking a good massage or acupressure class but it will provide the fundamentals in a very relaxing and accessable manner.",1132963200,,935,4.699386503067485
7995457,5,B0000A2ARV,"After years of stress from work, home and family, I received this DVD as a present.  I was skeptical about the effectiveness of learning massage techniques via video but I was pleasantly surprised.  The video was so relaxing and peaceful...it set the tone for a perfect wind down for the day as I channeled my stress and aggression into full mind and body relaxation.  My wife doesn't mind the extra little massage skills I picked up either.  It has helped me in so many ways.",1132012800,3,476,4.564705882352941
7995458,1,B0000A2ARV,"The title of the video seemed inviting. It immediately gave one the thought of how one could benefit learning to massage oneself by only paying 25 dollars for a DVD and having it as a reference tool for good. The quality of this video (its producers' good intentions, nonwithstanding) falls far short of its original promise, however. First of all, not nearly enough time is given to the different parts of the body. An area as large and complex as the trunk, for instance, is given only a few minutes of the most elementary moves that anyone with the simplest intuition for the body would already know how to do. It doesn't help either that the makers of the video refer to themesleves and their product as a 'movie' rather than a reference guide for someone seriously interested in learning the basic techniques of self-massage. To go along with that, much time is wasted in the beginning showing a couple getting up, making tea and such in order to create the right 'ambiance' for their self-massage. The time would have been more wisely spent showing clear massage techniques, I thought. Finally, the movements themselves seemed inadequate and the choice of the very few pressure points shown (and not others) appeared totally arbitrary. I bought this DVD, I'm sorry to say, with the best of intentions, thinking I would purchase Holomedica's other videos if this one was good. It wasn't. Not by a long shot.",1105660800,8,1412,4.790983606557377
7995459,5,B0000A2ARV,"I was given this video as a gift.  I would not put myself in the alternative medicine crowd, so I was at first a bit skeptical about the links to acupressure.  However, this video is put together so well!  It is not heavy on Chinese theory and very practical.  I have now watched it at least 25 times.  The first few times watching the video,  I was just using the techniques and ignoring the theory references, later I became more curious and actually learned a fair bit.
Amazon does not yeat have the other videos in the Holomedica series so I tried one from Amazon's most popular myMassageVideo.  Big mistake! (Don't believe the reviews) The comparison of the two videos was like comparing a National Georgraphic special against a local cable access education program.  Holomedica's video was that much better.  I'll wait for the others next time.",1066694400,4,850,4.727891156462585
7995460,4,B0000A2ARV,"I am happy to say that I was presently surprised by this video.  They actually made it so you can actually use it, enjoy it and follow along.  It is NOT just a platform for the massage therapist (or the Dr. in this case)nor is it the usual poorly shot ""massage class"" that drive me crazy.
It includes a lot of acupressure and meridian information during the massage which I know is backed by over 100 years of history but I am still in the converting stage - or I would have given it a perfect 5 stars.
I would say this video is a best bet for anyone who embraces alternative medicine or chinese medicine, or anyone who is looking for a relaxing, feel good routine - it tends to rejuvinate me.  Perfect for stress fiends like me.  No experience is required.",1059004800,6,757,4.2727272727272725
7995461,5,B0000A2ARV,"I picked up this video on the recommendation of my friend who is naturopathy school and am ever so grateful I did.
This video gently walks you through almost a full body massage including acupressure points in about 60 minutes.  What really makes this video so incredible is that the pacing and use of a narrator allows for enough time so I can massage myself during the course of the video.  The video includes helpful hints on how to find the perfect massage spot which is essential for acupressure.
I use this video when I come home from work to re-center myself.  I accredit it for my increased energy and sense of calm. And even better...I don't have to beg my husband for a massage anymore-I always got the short end!",1058572800,7,723,4.5038167938931295
7995462,5,B0000A2ARV,"well friends i think this is something, every body need, such a video make us fell that life is much better with a healty self massage... it's also fun...
