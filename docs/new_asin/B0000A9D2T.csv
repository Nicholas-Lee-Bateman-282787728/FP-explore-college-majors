7996308,4,B0000A9D2T,I was spellbound! This is a very informative addition to my collection. In this set you have a little bit of everything that one who's interested in the paranormal could want!! This set is one that you will want to see time and time again. Recently my grandson had a sleep over where everyone pitched their tents on the back yard...we have 5 acres in the country...and it was great telling them ghost stories I had gotten from this set!!! It not only a big hit for all ages..but it looks great displayed on my DVD shelves...very well packaged and in A-1 condition!,1280620800,,564,4.485436893203883
7996309,3,B0000A9D2T,Ok...The reason I have mixed feelings about this set is that there really isn't much about ghosts.  It's more about the paranormal and less about ghosts.  I found myself wanting to turn the channel sometimes because it was simply boring.  The set would have been much better if there had been more ghosts and less of the other stuff.,1171756800,3,333,4.610169491525424
7996310,1,B0000A9D2T,"ok...i bought these, not happy about them, everyone gave good reviews...but i have to say i am not impressed at all. alot of the stories put me to sleep and the quality of the footage looks more like home videos than documentaries..and with some of the dvds i had to adjust my tv to get a clear picture...not good, never had to do that before...i DONT recommend this collection at all.....grrrrrrrrr",1124668800,10,399,4.633802816901408
7996311,1,B0000A9D2T,i bought this dvd pack....and i have watched them... and i am not happy.....quality is bad....i found i had to adjust my tv settings in order to get a clear image on most of the dvds...it seems more like home videos than a professional documentary....very sad because i was really looking forward to this dvd collection...,1124668800,19,322,4.767857142857143
7996312,1,B0000A9D2T,"I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with this series. Most of the DVD's were so boring, I nearly fell asleep. An example of what I mean by ""boring."" Long periods of monotone, british accented, man speaking about the lives and deaths of people like Charles Dickens. About how his ghost ""might be walking the graveyard of a Rochester cathedral"" because that's allegedly where he ""wanted"" to be buried...but instead, they buried him at Westminster abbey...BOOOORRRRINNNNGGGG. Don't be fooled into purchasing these, thinking they will be the creepy stories that you see on  Sci-Fi, History Channel, A&E or Discovery Channel. They are low budget and  low entertainment value.",1106870400,31,663,5.304761904761905
7996313,4,B0000A9D2T,"I really have to say this is a good collection, but, i have many mixed reveiws on this. The whole collection was great to watch but some of them could have been left out:

Ghosts of England - Very good DVD, and i'll watch it again

Ghosts & Witches of Olde England- This one was a HUGE snore fest..its like watching the travel chanel. Would been better if they had a tour guide that told the history and the happenings thats been going on..other than that it'll put you to sleep

Ghost Hunters x3- Very good watch, would watch over and over

Mysterious Forces x3-Ok to watch only now an again.

Hollywood ghosts and gravesites- Yet another bore fest...too many graves...not enough ghosts

and those are my veiws. Rent before you buy",1104883200,21,732,4.507575757575758
