8401726,2,B003OX1AL8,"I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, and this looked good and it had a very cheap price tag. Now I wished I would have just rented it or looked for it somewhere else on the internet. Madsen, one of my favorite actors since the 90s, should stick to what he does best, acting, not making mockumentaries about himself and the paparazzi. Its extremely dry and boring from the beginning and doesn't get any better. It was definitely a clever creative idea, but not so great when put into action. Pass this one up.",1490659200,,504,4.372340425531915

8401728,3,B003OX1AL8,"This is made not to be taken too seriously, and I didn't. The filmmaking is some-
what Michael Moore meets Roger Corman! Madsen, Hannah, Carradine have
done a bunch of other type work since finishing the second of the overrated
Kill Bill schlock films. Kill Bill (*.5 stars), Kill Bill II (** stars) are a waste of cellu-
loid, as Leonard Maltin would say.

This ""Mockumentary' about tough guy Madsen is done with straight faces and
many get to show up in this celebrity roast, which moves at a fast pace. Watch
it when you can have time to ccarefully digest it. You'll be glad you did. And for-
get about Kill Bill and Kill Bill II. If you need to see a violent Martial Arts film, watch
Carradine and Hannah in Kung Fu Killer (***) instead. Rich Salzer, Reviewer, Va.,

8401730,4,B003OX1AL8,"Being Michael Madsen is a fun mockumentary and satirical commentary on media message distortion and tabloids.

Madsen (along with the others) leads the film in a mock interview detailing the events that led him to hiring his own team of filmmakers to catalog a paparazzi's life in the same way his life has been cataloged and intruded upon. The message here is that you can make anyone into the character you want them to be in the mass media and the general public will eat it up. As Madsen states in the film ""If you read something enough times, you start to believe it's real.""

What I find most humorous about it all is the way Madsen exploits this flaw in mass media while also doing the same with ""Being Michael Madsen"". The film is an exposition of tabloid distortion while it is really no different in-of-itself. We get to see the tables turned on the man spreading rumors about Madsen in what is presented as setting the record straight; really, it is only rewriting it. This is the beauty of the film in my opinion.

The documentary filmmakers in the story represent various aspects on film-making responsibility. In the film, they all become kind of accidental celebrities and tabloid subject matter. However, all 3 of them are left with different feelings about it. They started out as friends that basically took the job because it was a guaranteed gig. They wouldn't have to scrape and scramble so hard as 100% do-it-yourself filmmakers. The rift between them comes when they capture some shocking video that raises questions about their integrity. To me, this is the heart of the films message and the central question: Who does responsibility in media lie with? Is it up to filmmakers, is it up to the viewer or does it even matter?

There is a lot to like here.",1279584000,8,1778,4.6528662420382165
8401731,5,B003OX1AL8,"Before Being Michael Madsen was making rounds in the festival circuit, two young gals came into the store where I work asking for ANY DVD that starred Madsen. ""He's just the coolest, hottest guy ever!"" they gushed. I informed them that I knew of a film called Being Michael Madsen that would be released some day, and their eyes just lit up, making sure they wrote that title down. I still smile when I think of that, now having seen the film when it was screened at the Dances With Films festival in June of 2009 in Los Angeles. I can now say I agree with those gals, and while this film seems to be about Michael it's obvious everyone else is getting their share of the fun. He has some good competition with his sister Virginia here as well. Michael is so cool you want him to be your pal, though you might get the feeling he still could punch you. But you'd appreciate that he did.

Director/writer Michael Mongillo has done something I've always wished would happen: turn the tables on the paparazzi and/or tabloid reporters and have THEIR lives invaded and exposed, showing the skeletons in their closets. And while Being Michael Madsen turns out to be a mockumentary, there are still times when you forget about the faux part of it since actual facts about Madsen's life are intermixed with fiction. Whether or not you feel that completely works, there's no doubt you'll be hooked and go along with the ride. The full audience at the screening seemed to be willing and had a lot of fun. It's very apparent that when you have people putting together a film and enjoying doing that instead of it being just a ""process"" for them, something good will result.

The film sets up a scenario that a well-known tabloid's reporter/paparazzo Billy Dant wrote an article that Madsen killed a film extra (though no body was ever found), then gives us a background to Madsen's life and career, to then bring us back to the Dant situation. He then hires a three-person documentary crew to follow Dant and basically make his life hell. It was nice to see Mongillo regulars like Davis Mikaels (The Wind) as the camera guy, you just knew anything he was going to say in the rest of the film was going to make you laugh. Throughout all this we get interviews with Madsen's sister Virginia (who is absolutely amazing and very, VERY funny in her ""seriousness"") as well as friends Daryl Hannah, David Carradine, and Harry Dean Stanton (who got the entire theatre laughing by simply uttering one single word). Of course the documentary crew has its own inner conflicts, so things get mighty out of control very quickly.

Re-enactments of past situations were wonderfully performed in stiff, schlocky form, and I never imagined that a scene of a woman undressing could be so hysterically funny instead of erotic. That scene alone brought in some hearty laughs, along with Billy Dant getting bonked in the head with a boom mic.

Those that go in thinking this film is a real documentary will not be disappointed after realizing what's really going on, and those that already know the joke will still get a kick out of all the fun. The cast is having a great time (you can bet Paige Davis was having a grand time of it), and while some may say this is not a perfect film, its sheer entertainment makes it worth getting high marks. Some may say it's not a mass audience pleaser because of it poking fun at a particular part of the Hollywood scene, however that's not the case here since there's something for everyone. Fans of the Madsens, film insiders and officionados, and word of mouth can especially make this one a winner as well. Sit back with some snacks and enjoy! Be sure to stick through the credits for some surprises.

Michael Madsen says in the film: ""There's one thing I can't live with: a flat-out lie."" *WINK - WINK* !!",1275696000,5,3816,4.581259150805271
8401732,5,B003OX1AL8,"Michael Mongillo broke the mold making this film. It is one of the few laugh-out-loud films that had me trying to catch my breath by the end. I was lucky enough to see a screening in Denver a few years ago, and I continue to talk about this film. It is an amazing take on celebrity life and some of the best material comes from Madsen's own friends & family. I've ordered my copy early & can't wait to see the film again. It is amazing!!",1275609600,7,437,4.093023255813954
