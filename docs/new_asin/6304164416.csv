796207,1,6304164416,"Fantastic Planet is to Time Masters as The Oscar is to The DayTimeEmmy. As  Fine Art is to Blind Commerce.  As a beautiful bowel moveent is to severe  constipation.  It's 100% trash with the most ridiculous tacked-on ending  I've seen in my movie going history.  A total wash and a complete  disappointment.  Crap on a stick.  Light Years and Fantastic Planet are  beautiful, timeless.  Time Masters is close to unwatchable...and not in a  good way.  Most asinine movie I've seen next to....wow, I can think of no  comparison....Fortunately I was able to trade my copy in at a local used  goods store for a different DVD.  I pray that the poor sucker who buys this  one doesn't shoot his or herself in the head trying to watch  it....""Mike! Mike! Kill me now.""  If you watch this you'll get  that...please don't",968716800,,811,4.6571428571428575
796208,5,6304164416,"""Time masters"" is by far the best work of Rene Laloux. His other  works include ""Light Years"" and ""Fantastic Planet"".  This cult animation classic depics an ineteresting story with lots of  twists and excellent sound effects and animation. This work, besides having  a thrilling plot, has some philosofical elements. Watching it is  entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your couch.",968025600,,390,5.126984126984127
796209,2,6304164416,"The story as stated by Mircha, the romanian student of eastern philosophy  back in 1930s about his relationship with the daughter of his professor, is  the main content of the novel ""La Nuit Bengali"". The movie tried  to move the story to a modern time, and in that process did a horrific  distortion of everything including the local culture and customs, the  mindset of a modern Bengali girl, and the parental control exercised by  learned parents!
The cinematography is quite bad, given that it was  filmed only in 1980s when the cinematography has been improved 100 folds  from 1930s. If the time frame of the movie was in 1930s, then that kind of  cinematography could have been acceptable, probably, just for the sake of  the time frame matching!
The local language spoken by the actors were  terrible, the producers should have found a better solution to this. The  leading actresses were not Bengali, and it was an English film, so there  was no reason to put Bengali dialogue for them, but the director did, and  due to lack of efficient directorial supervision, they came out horrible  and wrong.
The film also shows the lack of imagination and research in  the comtemporary Bengali psyche and mentality and behaviour. If the story  had been set in 1930s, the incidents following the discovery by the parents  about the relationship of their daughter with the foreigner could have been  believable, but in the current context, it has been completely ridiculous,  and stupid and it has become a caricature rather than a film.
The music  was also pretty bad, the set and choice of location has been quite  horrible. The director should have seen some of Satyajit Ray films before  even venturing into this kind of a project.",965001600,,1732,4.836177474402731
796210,5,6304164416,"This is a must see, little known French animated classic. A touching tail of a little boy lost in a vast universe with a strange friend to help him. Visually and audibly beutifull this movie will have you in tears.",964137600,,214,4.375
7863303,2,6304164416,"Surrealist French animated sci-fi from the hand of Moebius, one of underground comics' most revered figures. Plodding but beautiful, it's generally best appreciated as an idea showcase and not necessarily a coherent story. Like a lot of his works, it's often inaccessible and tangential, more concerned with spotlighting the intrinsic weirdness of alien life than with shuffling the plot along. That slow, nonplussed tempo can be confusing, especially as a rescue party takes their time to splash about in a swimming pool and enjoy drinks while their quarry, a stranded young boy, fights nature alone on an uncharted planet. None of the cast, universally blas&eacute; and dull, seems overly concerned or motivated to chase their fates, and that irreparably wounds the big picture. Even the artwork, upon which many earlier Moebius works have hung their hats, seems rushed and incomplete. It does capture the general tone of the old master's trademarked style, but none of his precision or smooth, elegant linework. An interesting experiment either way, but not one I'm in a rush to revisit.",1420416000,,1090,5.234285714285714
7863304,4,6304164416,"Superficially, Rene Laloux' TIME MASTER seems geared for someone about the age of Piel, the 7 year old boy who's orphaned alone on the uninhabited planet PERDIDE. After his father crashes and dies while flying Piel home, Piel must survive until help arrives.  Piel's only contact with the outside world, is an egg shaped two way radio, called ""MIKE"". On the other end of this two way radio is Piel's father's friend Jaffar, who's space ship must go out of its way to save the boy. The stranded boy goes thru various pointless two minute long ""adventures"" with comical alien animals, while Jaffar pilots his ship to the planet. On the way there, Jaffar's ship stops at the mystical home of the RULER OF TIME. The old man, sort of a comic sage, sings songs and helps further the plot points. Not much happens during the first half of the film. The episodic plot is lost thru little adventures that don't move the story, but rather decorate it, while you wait to see if the boy is rescued. Once you abandon yourself to enjoying the various subplots, the disparate bits coalesce, providing a TOTALLY unexpected, unsettling conclusion. The film's final scenes leave the audience pondering not only the linear flow of time, but also the role of tragedy in life.

HOW this philosophical theme is accomplished in the film, provides the focus of most the discussion. Obviously TIME MASTERS is a cartoon, of a type that has all but been replaced by Computer graphics. MOEBIUS, the famous french graphic novel artist, who also was instrumental in designing the movie FANTASTIC PLANET, is reponsible for much of this film. Even tho the cartooning is simplistic, the ""mature"" scenes, ie the adventures of the adults on Jaffar's ship, are animated from filmed sequences in an almost rotoscoped fashion, like the swimming scene of Jaffar in the pool with the woman. So a type of realism is achieved, which elevates the animation beyond children's TV cartoons. Those bits of the film, like Piel's adventures with the alien animals, don't always further the plot, but they DO further the character development, and elaborate upon the film's THEMES. (ie the nature of Time, and Tragedy). Those meandering, almost pointless scenes help to produce the intense emotional response to the film's ending. If you intend to watch this film, and only consider it from the standpoint of its success at animation, you probibly won't like TIME MASTERS. However, if you accept the lack of detail with the line drawing, or lack of emotional expression drawn on their faces, and accept the oddly paced, episodic script, then the film works on its own terms. Animated films are ALWAYS judged to some extent, on the success of their animation, so that causes this film to drop a star. Also, the weak dialogue, and campy music, and slow tempo of the first half of the film, keeps this movie from being hailed as a classic.  But as a THOUGHT PIECE, and a good example of french surrealism touching base with new wave animation, the film is worth investigating by fans of this genre. Since the film deals with tragic events, and containes scary images, I wouldnt recommend it to very young viewers. Lets say  younger than 10-11 years old, depending on the sophistication, and emotional maturity of the child.",1353628800,,3270,4.833928571428571
7863305,5,6304164416,I purchased this after seeing Fantastic Planet.  I was blown away.  The story is a unique tale of lost boy on a strange planet whose only communication is through a two way walkie talkie egg that allows the boy to communicate with a space ship traveling to save him.  Moebius is the designer and that puts this film into my top ten all time animated favorites.  Bravisima!,1194307200,,372,4.507462686567164
7863306,4,6304164416,"Designed by the great graphic novelist Jean Giraud - AKA Moebius - Time Masters is a fascinating piece of animated sci-fi from France, that is well recommended for lovers of the genre and of the artist. Though the animation looks somewhat primitive by today's standards - though not for 1982, it looks quite better than any American cartoon of the time save Disney's, and don't forget that it wasn't a corporate effort like G.I. Joe or Transformers but an independent film with limited budget - but quickly enough you can learn the look past the rather bulky movements and simplistic faces of the characters and find yourself amazed at Moebius' amazing, seemingly endless imagination and creativity. The film is directed mainly at younger viewers - so it's not as liberated and wild as his more independent comics work or his contributions to Heavy Metal magazine - but his incredibly original vision is all there, in the out-of-this-world designs for the landscapes, the structures and the alien characters. Every minute of the film is a complete innovation in terms of design.

Plot-wise, there's not that much to be said for it; it's an intelligent but simplistic sci-fi story with a nice twist ending, which will, I think, appeal mainly to younger viewers. The characters are mostly simplistic and cartoonish, and largely unconvincing. These are the only reasons why I couldn't give Time Masters full marks; but these flaws take very little away from the pleasure of this film. As long as it focuses on the child character Piel, who is largely unaware of what goes on in the larger picture and is therefore touching and interesting, and not on the flat characters of Jaffar (good and brave for the sake of goodness and bravery), Matton (bad and greedy for the sake of badness and greediness) and the other adults; then it manages to be beautiful and gripping. And when any of the alien races are on screen, be they cute and cuddly or bizarre and frightening, you won't be able to look away. Time Masters is essential viewing for any lover of Moebius' work, and is well recommended for fans of science-fiction and of classic animation, and will surely become a treasured favorite for any of these.",1123891200,,2200,4.851063829787234
7863307,3,6304164416,"When it came to branching out to see new movies I had no idea that I would ever witness a French anime-style movie.  Yet this is that movie.  The story begins when a ship crash-lands onto a planet, and the child-aged son of the pilot is left alone there.  A rescue attempt is formed by, what we can assume to be, friends of the fathers, whom stay in contact with the boy throughout the attempted rescue.

  This is what the plot should be taken at for face value.  However, there is developing action on the rescue ship itself. All of the various sub-plots then are tied in with an unusual twist for the end. In addition, the movie is obviously in French, but with subtitles or the knowledge of the language, this should be no barrier for anyone.

  Now, I cannot comment on how this film compares with other French animation, for this is the first I have seen though.  I can say this though.  First of all, the animation was not that terrific, mediocre at best.  This movie is centered in plot, and not flashy graphics.  However, although the plot is not really lacking, it just gets a little dry at times.  Nonetheless, the movie had no horrible flaws and was really just, and I mean just, a decent movie.  Mildly entertaining, and only worth it for the last half I'd say, this movie only really deserves one view.",1093737600,,1316,4.420833333333333
7863308,5,6304164416,"I honnestly believe Sandeep K. Shukla is reviewing another movie than ""Time Masters"" (""Les maitres du temps""). A little Bengali's confusion :)
""Time Masters"" is a true animated SF masterpiece. But as other reviewers have stated here, it is a ""film d'auteur"", which obviously means some people might not like it. Feel free to rent it if you don't want to take any risk, but chances are you will run to buy it after.",1002499200,,414,4.608108108108108
7863309,5,6304164416,"The Time Masters is a rare example of French Animation. Despite being prolific art film makers the art of animation mainly passed them by. Therefore the skills employed in making this film are probably light years behind what Disney et al were producing with the help of the mighty Hollywood machine but that should not distract from an original and sublime vision that first captured my imagination as a young child. The Time Masters (Les Maitres du Temp in France) was inspired by L'orphelin de Perdide, a novel by French science fiction auther Stephan Wul. Importantly the design is by well known French graphic artist Mobius who is well known in comics circles for his Silver Surfer and Heavy Metal work and who also did the design for The Fifth Element. Overall this helped produce a film that was strikingly different, powerful and full of surprises even if the animation techniques were not as slick and glossy as those of Hollywood where skill and money abounded. I loved this as a kid and would expect any child today to quite enjoy its haunting story. As a big kid today I still enjoy this movie which is a rare gem of French animation. If you do enjoy this movie then check out Director Ren Laloux's next work La Plante sauvage (Fantastic Planet in the US I think) as you will enjoy that also.",991267200,,1304,4.625
7863310,5,6304164416,"I saw this cartoon 15 years ago when I was a kid and I remember that the plot really shook me up back then when I went Paris I saw it playing at a movie theater, once back in the states I bought the tape pretty much to relieve my childhood memories -- I didn't really have very high expectations.
Boy, was I wrong! 15 years later the story spoke to me on a very different level.  The cartoon is simply amazing both in terms of creative imagination and a story line -- there is more originality, meaning and plot in this one cartoon than in 10 Holywood blockbusters!",983750400,,565,4.18348623853211
7863311,4,6304164416,"these a very unfair comment about les maitres du temps [time masters]...it's certain that la planete sauvage [fantastic planet] was so great...the comparison is hard to do, but try to do so with an other space opera cartoon...and there is not so many!
i am really sure that it's one of the best science fiction cartoon ever made...realy a kind of ""film d'auteur"" with teh best of french science fiction, giraud (drawings...) apon an astonishing novel by Setphan Wul...
sure that almost every science fiction fan will enjoy it!",971049600,,526,4.921348314606742
