6196626,2,B00HQFA0J8,Not Funny. I like that he uses a dog - but I didn't think he was funny.,1438473600,,71,3.235294117647059
6196627,3,B00HQFA0J8,Its for dog lovers. I found it hard to get through so I will resume it at a later time. I'll probably revise my review.,1436745600,,119,3.8
6196628,5,B00HQFA0J8,"I LOVE TODD! Clean Comedy and with the originality of the dog act, this is something we are sorely lacking in today's entertainment landscape. He was fantastic on AGT and this video showcases him at his very, very best!",1436140800,,219,4.641025641025641
6196629,5,B00HQFA0J8,"I have never seen a ventriloquist that has mastered the techniques as well as Oliver.  His casts his voice so well, and shifts voices so effortlessly, that you quickly forget that this is one guy holding both sides of the conversation.  Then it gets really funny.  A few minutes into the act you just accept that dogs can talk, and you are caught up in the banter.  Oliver, and his talking dogs and his dummies,  keep the lines coming.

Like all good performers, Oliver reacts to the audience, and the audience reacts to him.  The video captures this well .  Oliver is quick on feet.  Audience volunteers and dogs don't quite do what you expect them to, and Oliver it turns into something hilarious.  That's what makes it so fun and engaging.  The act is aimed at the grown ups, but kids will catch enough.  My nine-year-old was enthralled.

I had seen Oliver live before so I bought the DVD knowing what to expect.  It's a blend of thinking, silly, and trickery that is completely engaging  Recommended.",1404086400,,1004,4.593220338983051
6196630,4,B00HQFA0J8,"I like comedy, and my son is a pretty humorous kid, so I thought he might like it as well. This was a good DVD to watch as a family. Aside from a few Kardashian references, it was clean and family friendly (That doesn't make it unfriendly for families, it was just references that meant nothing to my son).

Oliver is a ventriloquist who makes dogs and dummies talk. One of the funniest segments was when his dogs answered questions from the audience. Oliver worked well on his feet, which is handy since animals can be unpredictable, so he could turn an ""accident"" into a funny scene.

FYI -- only two of the dogs and one of those dummies pictured is actually featured in this DVD.

6196651,5,B00HQFA0J8,"I bought this video for my kids because I thought they would like the dogs. Turned out my wife and I liked it as much or more than our kids. I showed the video at a party for adults and they screamed with laughter. Looking at his website Todd has performed all over the U.S. with his talking dogs. Love to see if him live if he comes to San Diego. Loved it, buy it you won't be disappointed!

6196658,1,B00HQFA0J8,I love dogs but this wasn't watchable.  I was finally annoyed enough to turn it off after 15-20 mins.  I didn't laugh and I'm not sure who really would think that was comedy,1442275200,,173,4.212121212121212

8634253,5,B00HQFA0J8,"What can I say? Todd is an excellent ventriloquist with the amazing ability to change voices rapidly. His timing and humor is superb. It is really refreshing to see comedy done in a clean and wholesome way. He has a very unique style of entertainment. In this day and age with all the vulgar comedians, it is good to see a professional entertainer doing something for the family audiences. Truly enjoyed watching Irving. A really great DVD!
Truly worth watching again and again!!",1456790400,,479,4.783132530120482
