8245645,4,B0012EO65S,"Fake Ghost Catchers, directed by Lau Kar Wing was released by Shaw Brothers in 1982, a few years before ""Ghost Busters"" was released in the United States. And while I see few similarities by way of plot, it's entirely possible that the U.S. version might have been inspired by this Kung Fu gem.

Fake Ghost Busters stars Hsiao Hou as Bao, the pupil of a local con artist who purports to have connections to the spiritual world, Chang Chan Peng plays Zhou, the pupil's  cousin, who is on the run from a corrupt government official, and Alexander Fu Sheng plays Wu Chuntao, an ""unlucky"" opera star with a fetish for gambling. Lily Li plays Miss Lin, a local man's object of desire. When she marries, he decrees that after he kills himself, he will come back as a ghost to snatch her back.

He soon makes good on his threat, and after a mishap at the town's graveyard, involving Zhou, the man's spirit is awakened and he goes on a killing spree, haunting the loved ones of the woman who rejected him, later wrecking havoc on the locals using her possessed body.

Zhou gets together with his Bao, whose business is helping his con artist master conjure ""fake"" spirits. They decide that they will excorcise the man's demon from Miss Lin's house. The only problem is that the pupil doesn't believe in ghosts, he's doing it to make some cash on the side while the boss is out of town. When he meets the spirit haunting Miss Lin, Bao and Zhou are scared away, leaving the excorcism to a local shaolin monk.

Miss Lin, now dead (killed by her ghostly stalker), begins to haunt the pupil and his cousin, threatening to kill them if they don't take her to Kaifeng to protect her twin sister from the stalker's spirit who is on his way to possess her. She conjures a spell, attaching herself to an umbrella that neither of the guys can afford to lose, unless they pay the consequences. They vow to solve her murder and get rid of the ghost before he hurts anyone else. She tells them about an opera star whose uncanny gift is scaring away ghosts. So off they go to Kaifeng to report the corrupt officials to a local judge, and also to find the opera singer, played by Fu Sheng. In the mean time, they are trailed by the corrupt official and his men who wants the cousin and the pupil DEAD.

Together the three men devise a plan to destroy the ghosts, and now they are on Miss Lin's side.

There are two side-plots working in this movie, that of the corrupt official and that of the gamblers chasing the opera star. Each problem will meet head on with the ghost story so that all of the players will have to find a resolve. This is a FUN movie, with a fun plot. I wouldn't classify this as a typical ""kung fu"" movie. While there is kung fu, it doesn't drive the plot as in other Kung Fu movies. Fu Sheng and Hsiao Hou don't use any kung fu at all, while Chang Chen Peng does, to evade capture from the ensuing authorities.

I really enjoyed the movie. The ""ghostly"" special effects were done amazingly well, especially for a movie made in the early 80s. I kept thinking, 'wow, how did they manage that?' The parts where the characters were frightened - the facial expressions and the body language was downright hilarious. I would recommend this movie. It's very hard to find in the U.S. and took a while for me to see it after an extensive search.

I wish there was more kung fu and that my favorite kung fu stars did more, but the acting was terrific and so I can't really complain about anything else. I would definitely recommend. This little known classic would have been a cult hit if more people had known it existed.",1316131200,,3611,4.401799100449775
