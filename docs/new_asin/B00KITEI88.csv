8659376,2,B00KITEI88,The chicks in this was hot and that was about it. Just in case nobody knows. Kazuya is the father of Jin who was the main character in the first movie. My main problem with this movie is that it tried too hard to innovate Kazuya's epic backstory. You should actually go watch Tekken The Motion Picture because it does a whole lot better job at it..,1468368000,,348,4.208955223880597
8659377,3,B00KITEI88,Not that great of a movieif you don't know its a prequel.  But if you do know. Its still a little bit confusing. The story its not that great. Overall a decent movie,1459382400,,165,4.0

8659379,3,B00KITEI88,This Movie Has nothing to do with the first one. It was upsetting. Movie makers here's a hint. If you make a 2 make sire it goes with the first one,1411257600,2,147,3.774193548387097
8659380,1,B00KITEI88,"I would actually have preferred to rate this 0 stars, but I guess it gets 1 star for the martial artist. This should not even be associated with the TEKKEN franchise name. I'm pretty sure this is how the people in charge decided to put this together:

""Hey TEKKEN sells a lot. Lets make a movie about it.""
""Good idea! Whats it about""
""Oh, characters fight one another. On Wikipedia it says Kazuya and his father Heihachi are important""
""Easy. Movie with a martial arts guy named Kazuya who has a bad father Heihachi.""
""Wait..whats the story gonna be""
""Who cares! Martial arts man.. and a guy named Kazuya and a guy named Heihachi""

Seriously, that is the full extent of the movies relationship to the TEKKEN franchise. I wish I was joking.

I actually saw the original TEKKEN live action movie that this is a prequel/sequel to and enjoyed that more. At least in that one it was a fighting tournament, they had multiple characters, the characters at least SORT of tried to look like their video game counterparts with costumes etc. In this one.. same Heihachi.. with no hair lol and Kazuya..lol just look at the cover and tell me thats supposed to be Kazuya. Then again, with the people in charge of this, they probably said ""OH TEKKEN, MARTIAL ARTS, GOT IT"" then ""OH KAZUYA, ASIAN GUY, GOT IT""",1409529600,7,1293,4.564655172413793
