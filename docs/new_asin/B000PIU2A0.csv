2823909,1,B000PIU2A0,"A terrible film with no attempt at coherent plot.  I've read the plot summary and still can't connect it with the film.  Neil Johnson is obviously some narcissistic hack, as is the case with anybody being the writer, director, composer and acting in his own film.  What further disturbs me is someone's attempt to boost the IMDB rating and spread good reviews about this film.  The only thing monumental about this film is it has to be the worst film I have seen thus far in my life.  Don't bother, don't buy, don't support shameful film making like this.",1189296000,8,555,4.565656565656566
2823910,1,B000PIU2A0,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. I rented this movie at blockbuster because I couldn't find anything interesting lately in the SCIFI theme. This movie is terrible, no plot, CGI graphics are a joke.  I thought I was watching Dr. Who from the old days that's how bad the CGI is and their screenplay...well none! It's just a lady running up and down dunes running away from bad guy and guess what she has a video game addiction that she has to subdue with drugs!!! In the end she commits sucide to save and restart the universe...oh yeah the big bang!!! What a joke!!!!  ha..ha..ha..ha..ha..ha!!!!!!! Don't even buy it and if you don't believe me rent it first and judge for yourself!!! I gave it 1 star because I can't give it 0!!!  haaaa...ha.ha..ha..ha!!!",1188000000,3,763,4.595588235294118
2823911,1,B000PIU2A0,"What a dog. Germans may be able to make cars but not movies. Fortunately this was just a free blockbuster rental. Why the low rating?
Basic plot line- Good girl running from bad people/ one bad person who refuses to stay dead. Spoiler Alert: It seems like 90% of the movie is her hiking up one sand dune and down the other.  Last 5 minutes of the film, girl chooses to end her life so the universe can collapse in on itself and start again. No plot, No acting,No good CGA either. The other 2 reviewers must have been snoozing to give it 5 stars. Instead of wasting your time and money on this movie visit kiva org and provide a small micro-loan to a 3rd world needy someone. :-)",1187481600,6,678,4.2153846153846155
2823912,5,B000PIU2A0,"A Sci-Fi film that may appear at first to be an all-out action film but is in fact a deeper, intelligent (and slightly experimental) examination of where humanity will evolve to.  Fans of Blakes-7, British Sci-Fi series from the 70's will recognise the voice of Paul Darrow (Avon) who appears at the end of the film.  This film has touches of 2001 and Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  It is great that this film blends ancient myths with modern technologies.  Discussions about the Watchers from the Bible are presented with suitable explanations and explorations of who they are and where they come from.  My only complaint is that the film should be in widescreen.  I read on IMDB that the film was made in widescreen, so I hope there will a special edition with making-of's very soon.  I hope there are more films made like this.",1186963200,3,825,4.6482758620689655
2823913,5,B000PIU2A0,"As sweeping as this statement is, considering the universally sweeping story involved (including the very end of the universe with a self-created hope for the next one), this indie-directed/produced sci-fi film is one of the very best and I highly recommend it, especially to those true sci-fi purists and collectors! And, regardless of what some critiques might say, it is NOT an ""Armageddon rip-off""! Not by a long shot! Not unless Bruce and Billy Bob go to the very End-of-Time to do their thing! Two thumbs way, way up!",1184198400,2,523,4.887640449438202

8191858,1,B000PIU2A0,"Trailer was amazing, looked like some cross between battlestar galactica and star wars on steriods. Actual movie movie however, seemed more like ""The Cold Equations"" on Prozac!. Imagine if Luke skywalker died before he destroyed the Death Star and Princess leia found herself at the end of time and killed herself,
Dumbest-sci-fi-movie-ever! Not even would Mystery Science Theater 3000 waste their time with this one....",1413849600,,420,5.476923076923077

8191861,4,B000PIU2A0,"this movie at worst is a three stars, it really has some kinda silly things so you have to stretch your mind or imagination butt at least half of the scenes are really good, since i like it, i gave it four stars, i think most will see it at three or more stars.",1256083200,,261,3.8518518518518516
8191862,2,B000PIU2A0,Science fiction it is but that is about it. Not a worthwhile DVD to have as the story line is OK but the narration style and poor acting really makes it almost boring to watch. Thank goodness for fast forward. That made it barable.,1208304000,,231,4.2727272727272725
8191863,1,B000PIU2A0,This movie is bad. It is long and it has terrible production. The movie is like narrated by her daughter. Bad special effects. You can see the terrible movie production in everything. Do not waste your time and money.,1206576000,,217,4.589743589743589
8191864,1,B000PIU2A0,Worst waste of two hours ever.  We must have been two of the ten people ever to see the end of the movie.  If you think you are going to make it to the end of the movie...shoot yourself first.  My ears are still bleeding.  Porky's revenge deserved an emmy compared to this piece of cosmic crapola.,1199059200,2,297,4.157894736842105
8191865,1,B000PIU2A0,"While the special effects make the film look more like a video game than something for the big screen, the biggest malady it suffers from is a lack of dialogue. The writers have attempted to use voice overs, which are often used in giving some background or introductory information at the beginning of a film, to replace dialogue between the film's main characters. I have to admit I would find it hard to write dialogue for characters as shallow as the pro/antagonist are, but the solution then would be to write deeper characters, rather than compensate for one mistake by making another.

The film is littered (intentionally or unintentionally) with blatant references to other sci-fi works:

And so on...

Unless you're bored, I'd give this one a miss. Even if you're bored, there are plenty of other things to do that won't waste two hours of your life.",1193875200,9,1678,7.052884615384615
8191866,4,B000PIU2A0,"Of several lower budget, recent SF movies I rented (e.g., Earthstorm and Android Apocalypse ... even the higher budget, more mainstream The Fountain, for that matter), this was definitely my favorite.  I enjoyed the plentiful SF ideas and the lead actress.  They actually tried on the special effects, keeping the visuals coming (however nowhere near state-of-the-art, Star Wars type realism).  Recommended for those who like to read SF, appreciate better writing, but can forgive the budgetary limitations.",1190505600,14,507,5.558441558441558
