8522641,5,B007WLEBJ6,"I really enjoyed watching this series on cable.  However, I left cable for satellite.  So the only way for me to get this was to buy the series.  I have 24 seasons.  I have been watching this quite a bit.  My only issue is that the Seller didn't make it clear about the Region codes for DVDs.  I had to buy a DVD Player that would play DVDs from the UK.  I didn't know that different parts of the world have different formats.  However, I have learned with this purchase and now I have a DVD Player that will play DVDs from anywhere on earth.",1403136000,2,542,4.095238095238095
8522642,5,B007WLEBJ6,we love last of the summer wine. wish they would come out  with more new ones. foggy was the funniest actor,1396828800,,107,4.095238095238095
8522643,5,B007WLEBJ6,I have a list of all the series.  The master list this is series 22 and 23.  I wish they would come on with the rest of the series on DVD.  The wait is the worst thing.  I love the bumbling old guys dealing with retirement and making the most of their days.  They keep you laughing at their silly antics.  I think the show got better as time went on.  The blending  of new characters has been so smooth.  If you love Last of the Summer Wine -gotta love this too!,1394668800,,462,3.9347826086956523
8522644,5,B007WLEBJ6,This series matched all other LOTSW I have purchased.  The calming effect that the characters have over me make for enjoyable times.  I will continue to replay them for a very long time.,1389398400,,186,4.606060606060606
8522645,5,B007WLEBJ6,"We were delighted with this part of the series and are looking forward to the last few years when the show ended in 2010.  Although you need a Region 2 DVD player, it is a nominal expense to be able to enjoy a show of this caliber.  The company provided prompt service, and also verified with us that we had the appropriate equipment with which to view the episodes.",1372118400,,366,4.2898550724637685
8522646,5,B007WLEBJ6,"The series continues without Compo but just as funny. The addition of Billy Hardcastle, a direct descendant of Robin hood and Tom Owen are quite nice.  Even though Babs isn't very funny and Mrs. Avery isn't to my liking the show continues to shine in these seasons.
I can't wait to get the later series.
These are region 2 DVDs.  Unless you have a multi-regional DVD player, or if you want to change your PCs DVD drive to region 2 you will have problems viewing them.  If you are not a novice then you know enough to rip these to H264 via Handbrake/MakeMKV ( or DVD decrypt) and you can enjoy them on a PC or your TV.  Both ""free"" at the moment.",1369526400,,645,4.219512195121951
