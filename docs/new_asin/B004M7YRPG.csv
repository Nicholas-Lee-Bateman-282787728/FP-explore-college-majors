8435675,5,B004M7YRPG,"This was unexpected. I was house minding for a friend of mine and well, bored, so I had a look through her DVD collection and came across BELLADONNA. How is it that I knew nothing about this movie before? how is it that more people don't know about it? it is a love story with a twist... that occurs in two different times...haunting, and beautiful. The actors are amazing...it's a real gem!! I'm so so glad that I have seen it!!",1321747200,,429,4.308641975308642
8435676,5,B004M7YRPG,"There are moments in ones life when on reflection you realise they were huge turning points.

The movie Belladonna was one of these moments in time for me.  It was truly an `A-Ha!' moment.

The topic of reincarnation can cause many a flurry in the world of organized religion & the masses in general.  I had previously read about & studied the subject of Re-incarnation but it was the synchronicity of events in the movie that mirrored my own life that finally ""actualized"" the teachings & made this movie more than just a film.

On the surface Belladonna is a wonderfully told Love story...
Dig deeper, it is a tale of transformation through choice & free will, not only for the characters but for the audience as well.

Rarely does a film cause one to search their own lives for meaning.... & even rarer does a film answer some of the huge questions we ask ourselves regarding relationships we have had & why we connect with many people in different ways & on various levels (not always from a healthy perspective.)

The surface simplicity of the script slowly reveals itself to be layered in complexity with some of the issues the characters face being born from &  brought through from previous lifetimes...  some we never see, but can only imagine....

Karma, otherwise known as the Law of Cause and Effect is on show here...
(Remember that Karma is neither good nor bad - its the law of 'balancing out')

Actions we took in a previous life...good & bad (the Cause)....
Come back to greet us in our present day life in positive & negative ways (the effect)....
And it is through our free will & choices we make in THIS life, here in THIS moment, that can help steer us in new directions yet to unfold...

Are you brave enough to watch a film that could change your life???

... The choice is yours!

If you loved Hugh Jackman & Rachel Weisz in the film 'The Fountain,' or Shirley MacLaines book & film 'Out on a Limb' you will cherish this masterpiece.",1316217600,,1957,4.5227272727272725
8435677,5,B004M7YRPG,"Belladonna is truly a magical piece of art. Where love transcends, this movie weaves a wonderful trail that shows the complexity and yet simplicity of our wondrous life. For me Belladonna sits happily beside what the bleep and you can heal your life, this is a movie I recommend to all my friends and to those friends I've yet to meet.",1307923200,,335,4.508196721311475
8435678,5,B004M7YRPG,"This is the most beautiful film I have seen in a long time. I bought the DVD after seeing it in the cinema, and every time I watch it , I see something more. It has made me think about all the relationships in my life and prompted me to really be clear about myself and how I relate to the important people in my life, and who those people are.
I have shown a few friends as well, and have found it really interesting that they have responded in very different ways to me. Lots of interesting discussions have ensued!! But, as I tell them, just watch it, it's a fascinating love story, beautifully told and filmed.",1305849600,2,614,4.211864406779661
8435679,5,B004M7YRPG,"Belladonna is a beautiful GLASS KINGDOM picture soon to be released. I had the honor of receiving an advanced copy from the writer/producer, Annika Glac.

It is an exciting love story with interwoven past life memories. I was delighted at the first scene when the voice over is a female Hypnotherapist leading her client through a past life regression. It was beautifully portrayed with some of the same imagery I use in my hypnotherapy practice. The main character, Luke, is preoccupied with bits and pieces of spontaneous past life recall. Many of us have these and don't even recognize what it is. Recurring dreams are often past life memories slipping through.

The interplay of love between more than two of the characters made Belladonna interesting. Many people have a romanticized version of what a soul mate is and that there is only one. Maybe there is only one soul mate and maybe not, but we can certainly love many deeply. Love is deep and complex and so is this script. Luke is marrying his long time love, Katherine, when Amelia comes into his life and he tries to understand why she is so familiar when they have never met before. How can we be so drawn to someone we've never met? Something so deep unravels within him. In addition, the film is visually beautiful and the acting superb. The synopsis describes Belladonna as a mesmerizing love story and boy it is!

It is also very interesting how many nuances were brought through the various lifetimes. This is fascinating because I see this in with clients and I am glad that the writer and director were aware enough to add many interesting elements. For example, past life preferences often stick with us like an affinity for a certain era or maybe we collect civil war memorabilia. These habits and areas you feel pulled toward are often clues to your past lives. In Belladonna, Luke is drawn to a career choice that reflects his past life skills and I find this to be a common thread for my clients. They build upon previous skills and experiences and bring them forward to the present. It may even surprise you to know that children often create drawings depicting past life occurrences.

I am thrilled at the launch of this movie and look forward to its great success. Belladonna is such a mainstream and handsome movie that I think it will help bring about more kitchen table conversations about past lives. There are so much healing and joyful connections available through past life regression and the prospect of having more awareness brought to the subject truly excites me!",1304899200,3,2554,4.758465011286682
