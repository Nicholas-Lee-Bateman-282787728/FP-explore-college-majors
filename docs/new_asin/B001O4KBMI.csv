Finally, our wait is over!!  I enjoyed this show when it was on originally and am glad to see that somebody has had the good sense to release it on DVD.  I hope that everyone will support this one so that the distributors will be encouraged to release all the episodes, even those from Showtime.  All of the characters and the interactions with Professor Kingsfield are worth every moment of your time spent watching.  Hooray for those who appreciate the television shows of the past!  Hooray for Professor Kingsfield!  I can't wait to see him again!!!!",1234656000,4,724,5.903846153846154
3727527,5,B001O4KBMI,Finally the best show ever cancelled comes to DVD.  Let's hope the Showtime seasons will also show up.  I signed up to Showtime just for this show (and have stayed there ever since.)  The whole cast for this season and all the following were excellent!  I can finally dump all those VHS tapes that I have saved and watched over and over and that bootleg set (which was worse than my own VHS tapes).,1234569600,2,398,4.337837837837838

3727529,5,B001O4KBMI,"As others have written, ""The Paper Chase"" is one of the best, most compelling dramas ever made for television. A critical darling when it first aired, it was really too intelligent and did not find a large enough audience on CBS. However, it was so good that it just would not die quietly. After gaining more kudos in reruns on PBS, Showtime brought it back several years later luring back the key players from the first season to continue in ""The Paper Chase - The Second Year"" and ""The Paper Chase - The Third Year."" Showtime finished its run with a final six episodes called ""The Paper Chase - The Graduation Year"" which was actually a continuation of the third year. It maintained an incredible level of excellence from the first season through its Showtime years.

Based on the novel by John Jay Osborn Jr.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase/dp/087875539X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase</a>&nbsp;and the motion picture of the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase/dp/B00008UALL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase</a>, the television series far surpasses the quality of its predecessors. It reminds me in some ways of ""M*A*S*H,"" the series, which was far and away better than its original book and movie. Unfortunately, unlike ""M*A*S*H,"" once Showtime finished ""The Paper Chase"" more than 20 years ago, it has been rarely seen since. It is so well written, so well acted, so compelling and dramatic, that it deserves a chance to find a new audience on DVD.

If you watched it in its day and liked it, please purchase a copy and show the distributor (Shout Factory) that there is a market for the rest of the series. Even if you did not see it when it first aired, but you appreciate intelligent, thought-provoking drama, give it a try and spread the word. You don't have to be a lawyer or law student to identify with the characters and the daily events in which they find themselves. It's a story and television series for all of us.",1234051200,44,2072,5.333333333333333
3727530,5,B001O4KBMI,"So excited this series is finally being released on DVD. Does this mean I can finally throw away my precious VHS tapes?

I had almost lost hope, as the series seems so obscure to most people that they don't know what I'm talking about when I proclaim it one of the best-written television series EVER! It screened here in Sydney at 5.00am, so no wonder everybody missed it. It was a travesty, really.

Can't wait to get my boxed set. Here's hoping they will release the later PBS seasons as well, because this excellent series just seemed to get better and better. Even as the students moved on to second and third year law, and the support cast changed significantly, each new cast member was somehow even better realised -- all the way through to that fateful episode where Hart is faced with his graduation dilemmas.

Sigh. This was a classis series. If you are reading this review and enjoy tight, intelligent writing, lovable characters, tour de force performances and a series which handles both human minutia and the great dilemmas of life with equal sensitivity -- then buy buy BUY!",1233705600,6,1090,4.696335078534031
3727531,5,B001O4KBMI,"I was in my first year of high school when this show was on. I remember my teachers in high school paroding Kingsfield: Take this dime call your Mother... I really got into it that year and I subsequently watched it when it appeared on PBS. When it was on ShowTime, during my college days, My family didn't have cable so I used to follow the stories in the blurbs in the Newspapers and T.V. Guide. You have no idea how much pleasure it gives me that it has finally become available. I have been trying for years to find these. I even petitioned the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC. They carried a couple of episodes from the Showtime era.  One of the greatest shows ever. Now if they would only put Steve Allen's ""Meeting of Minds"" on.",1233100800,7,733,4.311594202898551
3727532,5,B001O4KBMI,"Fans of Classic TV shows should rejoice with the release of The Paper Chase on DVD.

Based on an unforgettable 1973 movie, the series focused on the lives of students struggling through law school at a prestigious university.

The series lasted only one season on CBS with 22 episodes, from 1978 to 1979, and this boxed set from Shout! Factory collects those episodes, which revolves around the students' first year of 'trial' and tribulatios.

PBS reran the series then the cable channel Showtime revived the series in 1983, where it lasted for three more seasons.

The series centered around student James T. Hart, a core cast of fellow-students, and one truly dominant force of nature in the form of a legendary law professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., played beyond iconic perfection by the fabulous John Houseman.

Houseman had starred as Kingsfield in the movie version, then unbelievably reprised the role on the small screen to the delight of his fans. Sadly, Houseman died a year after the Showtime incarnation of the series ended.

Hart, played by James Stephens in the series, and by Timothy Bottoms in the movie, is a hard-working student from Minnesota whose background ill prepares him for the rough and tumble of law school.

Hart is utterly terrified and fascinated by Kingsfield, who challenges his students so vigorously that he has become a legend in his own time, and his classes are both loathed and cherished.

The professor, the undisputed authority on contract law, becomes an unwilling and unknowing mentor to Hart, who decides he will do anything he can to meet and exceed the expectations of the master legal-eagle. By the time the series ends on Showtime, Hart graduates.

While the series explores the relationship between Hart and his co-students who form a study group, it is Houseman's Kingsfield that inhabits every inch of the show, even when he is not on screen - a lasting testimony to the actor's skill.

Stephens and Bottoms have devoted fan bases who argue one actor's portrayal is the quintessential Hart. For me, Stephens brings a sensitivity and likeability that Bottoms does not. Of course, Stephens had many episodes to imbue the character with his style.

In the series, Hart's best friend, Franklin Ford III, is played by Tom Fitzsimmons, while actors Willis Bell, James Keane, and Betty Harford, (Kingsfield's secretary) round out the core cast in the first season, which aired on CBS.

The joy of the show was the great scripts which managed to combine humor, tension and incredible stress caused by constant, rigorous study, with friendship and deeper, philosophical issues brought up by the legal topics they were learning. In short, it was one of the best cancelled TV series EVER!

This boxed set includes the 22 episodes from the CBS season: The Paper Chase Pilot; Great Expectations; The Man Who Would Be King; A Day in the Life of...; Voices of Silence; Nancy; Da Da; The Seating Chart; Moot Court; Kingsfield's Daughter; The Sorcerer's Apprentice; Bell and Love; An Act of Desperation; Losing Streak; The Man in the Chair; A Matter of Honor; The Apprentice; Once More With Feeling; The Clay Footed Idol; The Tables Down at Ernie's; A Case of Dtente; and Scavenger Hunt.",1231545600,95,3226,4.962894248608534

You cannot but admire the attitude of Professor Kingsley (John Houseman -  brilliant actor) towards teaching - he gets the right results.  So glad I am able to see it all over again - it took me back to my life as it was then. I am about to order the 2nd series. Thank you Amazon for having this available (bit of a sting though having to pay 13.02 to the Post Office on arrival in the UK for Customs as it makes the item very expensive -  but then that is not your fault),1377561600,,539,3.9722222222222223

This was a very well done production back in the late 70's depicting law classes and the pressure students were under to acheive success. This series had good story lines with superb acting. John Houseman strikes terror in the hearts of his students as he reprises the role that won him an Oscar for the movie version. For someone like me that never missed an episode back then, having this dvd is pure joy.

3727596,5,B001O4KBMI,"This is a great series about first-year law students at prestigious school. It centers around James Hart, a promising 1L who goes to classes held by Professor Kingsfield. The episodes discuss the law and what it means, not to mention the pitfalls the students run into. A great program, Paper Chase made me want to be a lawyer when I was a teenager, although the more I saw it the more I had reservations!

The character of Kingsfield is a powerful one. He plays the seemingly all-knowing professor, the man who has a ready barb for any student who gives the wrong answer or, worse, is unprepared for class. Kingsfield is famous not just at the school but in the practice of law itself. He is rigid but fair and even has a soft side... one that he rarely if ever shows. A great drama, with a certain amount of humor mixed in, Paper Chase is a wonderful program. I truly wish there were more like it.",1365638400,,899,4.383233532934132
3727597,4,B001O4KBMI,"This was one of my favorite TV program from the 80s (in my country). Pitifully this episodes don't have subtitles in English or Spanish. It's good for me to learn English but the legal terms confuse me.  Even so worth every dollar of investment. Thx Shout Factory to revive ""The Paper Chase"".

3727615,5,B001O4KBMI,This was a wonderful trip down memory lane. I loved this series from the very first episode. I only hope they release the final two seasons eventually.,1362182400,,151,4.62962962962963
3727616,3,B001O4KBMI,"If I could give two separate reviews of this product, I would give probably 4 to the series and content and 1 to the DVD quality itself.

It is nice to be able to watch this series again. I grow up watching this with my father, which by the way, was a criminal lawyer and a judge. The series was translated and transmitted in spanish language in my native Country and I really found the series very interesting and entertained. Very different to what we have now which is full of sex and violence.

If you never had the chance to watch this series, or you are younger than me ;-) , this series is about law school students and all the adventures they have to live due the very high intensity of their classes and teachers, specially Professor Kingsfield, a role that is played by John Houseman. Kingsfield and Hart, one of his most dedicated law students, are the most interesting roles in the series, in my opinion.

There is no action, sex or complicated story lines here. So if you are more into suspense or action kind of series, you won't like this one. But if you want to remember your university days or somehow miss that, or if you are studying to become a lawyer, you may love this series and even laugh at times.

Now, the reason for my 3 start rating is because the video and audio quality. I was under the wrong assumption that this was remastered and edited; instead, the episodes are not Full HD , not even good enough for modern televisions. Maybe I am asking too much, but I've found myself watching better 70 and 80s video clips on YouTube and they are free.

Overall, good and nostalgic T.V. series. I can live with the poor video and quality content but I was expecting a better product with some type of ""post-production"" or digital editing, in order to compensate for 30+ years age that the series already has.",1358812800,5,1831,4.421364985163205

3727618,5,B001O4KBMI,"I saw the first season of this show when it originally aired so watching the DVD set brought back many memories, especially of Professor Kingsfield.  I remember some of the comments he made to students and hearing them again made me smile.  John Houseman is such a commanding screen presence that it is hard to look at anything else when he is on the screen.  Even a slight raising of an eyebrow means so much.  I like the TV series better than the film on which it was based.  Sure, there are some things that make it look dated...the clothes, cars and the amount that things cost.  In one episode, one of the law students owes $800 after losing at poker and is panicked beyond belief.  To help him, one of the other students appeals to his employer for an advance.  The employer, in all seriousness, says he could advance him $20 or $30 and he could pay it back over the next few months.  I know that $800 isn't a small amount today but I assume it would be more like losing $5,000 or so in today's dollars and that a $20 ""loan"" back then meant more than it does now.  That's fine.  Looking at the hairstyles and the issues of a certain era can add to the viewing experience.

To anyone considering the purchase of this set, I would say it is worth it just to watch John Houseman perform.  He is mesmerizing and worth the cost of the set.  Consider everything else a bonus.",1328400000,,1375,4.299610894941634
3727619,4,B001O4KBMI,"You can't beat the first season of The Paper Chase.  It's a breath of fresh air, as intelligent network programming was rare in the 1970s and is rare even today.  That may explain why the show was cancelled after the first season, only to be reconstituted on cable tv.  I don't believe the show ever matched season one, but I'll restrict my review to that season.  If you're looking for intelligent dialogue, suspense, and some good laughs without slapstick, this is the show and season for you, and, finally, for me.

John Houseman reprises his role as Law Professor Charles Kingsfield and does a terrific job. The other actors are all very good too in their roles as first year law students. Individually, each character is well developed and not necessarily a foil to the lead, James Stephens. Although the writing does become a little predictable towards the end of the season the first few episodes are riveting. It was a treat to watch a show that is as intelligently written and enacted as this one. I'm looking forward to Season 2.",1326067200,,653,4.5423728813559325

3727624,5,B001O4KBMI,"I purchased season 1 of Paper Chase not expecting much, but I was presently surprised after viewing the first few episodes. Paperchase presents very well-written stories about a group of first year law school students who form a study group. The series is especially focused on Hart, a well-liked, intelligent student from a farm in the Midwest. The series deals with the typical grad school stuff: studying, maintaining a social life, killer professors. However it delves into serious social issues such as affirmative action, the cold war, and women's rights. One of my favorites is the episode on affirmative action when Hart realizes that as a student from a farm he is also a recipient of affirmative action - something that tends to escape many opponents of this issue. The highlight of the PaperChase is professor Kingsfield - the kind of professor you wish for. He is a tough grader who demands the best from his students. He maintains a harsh exterior but goes to great lengths to stand up for his students and support them without taking credit. Overall this series is not fast paced and there are a couple of ""duds"" (plots that really don't go anywhere or makes sense), but it is a highly amusing series and now I am off to buy the next season.",1298419200,,1255,4.735159817351598

3727649,5,B001O4KBMI,"The Paper Chase ran for 3.5 seasons, one on CBS, and 2.5 (the final season being a short one) on the then-young cable network Showtime. This is the inaugural season from CBS. When Showtime picked it up, they advertised it as the show that was ""too good for commercial television"", and they were right.

This was the era when cheesy sitcoms dominated the airwaves. Dramas were cop shows like Starsky and Hutch and Columbo, ""detective"" series Charlie's Angels, schmaltzy family series like The Waltons, general idiocy like The Love Boat, and the beginning of the prime-time soap era with Dallas. Some of those had their merits, but the Paper Chase was an oasis in television's ""vast wasteland"".

The first season is the story of five first year law students at an unnamed law school that was pretty clearly supposed to be Hah-vahd... errrr.... Harvard Law, focusing on the idealistic James Hart, played by James Stephens.

The real star of the show, though, was John Houseman, absolutely brilliant as the intimidating contracts professor, and general deity of The Law (capitalization intentional -- I am certain you can hear the capitals when he says it) Charles W. Kingsfield.

The stories are all compelling, the characters well-written and likable. Even Kingsfield is given a human side, albeit one he rarely if ever displays to his students.

Now, there is a very definite ""seventies"" feel to the whole thing. The clothing and hairstyles obviously are from that era. A number of the episodes have ""very special episode"" written all over them, but even then, they're well done.

Since this was from the era when the idea of storylines spanning multiple episodes was pretty much unknown, there's a lack of continuity that will seem a little odd to fans of modern television. For instance, one character develops a gambling problem in one episode. Forty five or so minutes later, its resolved. It gets brief mentions in one or two later episodes, but isn't addressed further. A modern series would probably take several episodes to cover that -- he'd take up playing poker in one episode, wind a few hands in another, start losing later, get into debt even later, etc.

While Shout Factory deserves enormous kudos for releasing such a fine series on DVD, the reproduction of it is weak. They certainly don't have the sharpness expected from a DVD (especially not if you've been spoiled by Blu-Ray). I realize that the masters may not have been in the best of shape, but don't expect this to look as stunning as your Blu-Ray copies of Lost, for instance.

And then there's the ungodly painful Seals and Croft theme song that gives Seventies light rock a (very very) bad name, but that's what fast forward buttons were invented for. (Thankfully, Showtime ditched that for their episodes, replacing with a classical piece -- Bach, I think.)",1263859200,5,2836,4.906054279749478

3727651,5,B001O4KBMI,"Recipe for life during law school:  Mix five diverse personalities, stir in one curmudgeon of a law school professor, simmer for four years.

The Paper Chase, for its time, and even possibly for our time 30 years after first being broadcast, was, and remains one of the finest examples of broadcast television.  That the original Professor Kingsfield, John Houseman, himself one of the most productive people in quality show business world would return to his oscar winning role, bears testimony to this.  A person of his stature would not have come back to a program of lesser standards.  In point of fact, one episode from this set, ""a case of detente"" illustrates that Houseman would not be associated with this script as it was of much less quality than some of the others.

There were several episodes culled from sub plots in the movie, but when I saw the movie, I wondered what could be made from these themes (Kingsfield's daughter, the cheating on the exam, the formation of the study group, etc.)  These original plot points were examined quite well in the first year of the series.  Other original plots were quite well done also.  Of course Kingsfield was preachy, but what he had to say made sense even outside the milieu of the television screen.  This series is a must have for any one considering further education.

  If art truly imitates life, the screenwriters, directors, and actors paid educational life the highest compliment with this series.",1263081600,,1466,4.862903225806452

3727653,1,B001O4KBMI,"Caveats: 1. I loved the movie version; 2. I have not seen the Showtime seasons, so this review is about the CBS season only.

I had always heard that this was as great a show as it was a movie. It was not anywhere near as good.

The best way I can describe this series is that it seems like someone took a can of drama and poured it in the mix, forgetting to pour in a can of plot and story. Let's examine the episode (probably the 5th and last one I could stand to watch) where the father or Hart's girlfriend is killed. The father is a famous mob lawyer who is under constant threats. Kingsfield treats the father as a pariah. Father gets killed, and the episode focuses on the relationship and stress between Hart and the girlfriend. So many things are just left for us to assume. And what about who killed and why was the father killed?

Imagine that I told you that a tiger ate a couple of kids at the school bus stop next to my house, then went on about how I hope my dog wasn't traumatized too much or afraid of tigers. Wouldn't you ask me if I knew where the tiger came from, or if I tried to get the dog back inside to take cover, or even if I called the police? Isn't that what's really more interesting?

In a nutshell, most of handfull of episodes I viewed were like this: Drama for drama's sake and no story.

As for those who view the series as intellectual or somehow high brow, I submit that a crowd exists that thinks anything to do with Harvard is intellectual. Those rating this highly may also be deluded by memories from not seeing this in 30 years.",1260489600,4,1570,4.151315789473684
3727654,5,B001O4KBMI,"I enjoyed the Paper Chase series so much in the 80s and have been waiting a very long time for it to be released.  Two years ago I got ripped off by a Canadian Firm (The Digital Donkey), which took my money for the entire series and never sent anything.  That was how hungry I was for it and my first and hopefully last time to be burnt ordering on the internet.  Now that Amazon is selling it, we ordered it and my kids (boys, 11 and 17) have loved it.  My oldest has been thinking of a career of law, so this actually helped show the craziness, studying and hard work that would be involved.  So now we are waiting for Season 2-4 to be offered on Amazon and will continue our family movie time with a classic, hope ya'll enjoy too.",1259971200,,733,4.0979020979020975
3727690,5,B001O4KBMI,"I was a very young child when ""The Paper Chase"" TV show was airing, but I watched the movie as a teenager and just absolutely loved it. It was only recently that I became aware that a TV show was made based on the movie, and I am glad I checked it out because the series is very interesting and engaging. The talented John Houseman reprises his role as the dour and formidable Contracts professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Timothy Bottoms's role is replaced by James Stephens (playing James Hart), the farm boy from Minnesota who takes Kingsfield's class because of Kingsfield's excellent reputation in the field. In the first episode, poor Hart is ""shrouded"" on his first day in Kingsfield's class, a death sentence of sorts because it renders him 'invisible' to Kingsfield (he won't call on any student that has been shrouded, and there's one student who suffers this every year). But Hart is made of sterner stuff and his indomitable and easy-going manner gets him through some very rough patches. He shares his law school experience with a group of classmates who come together in a study group and form close bonds as a result - Franklin Ford III (played by Tom Fitzsimmons) is an over-confident, rich guy whose family background is deeply rooted in law, and who faces intense pressure from his over-achieving dad; Thomas Anderson (played by Robert Ginty) is an arrogant and competitive guy who initially takes a dislike to Hart before hitting it off; the rest are Willis Bell (played by James Keane), Elizabeth Logan (played by Francine Tacker)the sole female in the study group, and Jonathan Brooks (played by Jonathan Segal) is the only married student in the group and his well-to-do young wife Asheley is played by Deka Beaudine.

The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the acting is credible, especially by Houseman and Stephens. Though I liked Timothy Bottoms' portrayal in the movie, I love Stephens' portrayal as Hart - very down-to-earth and real, his performance is nuanced and well-portrayed. The others in the supporting roles are also very good. The only thing I felt could have been better was the picture quality which is what one would expect of a series filmed in the 70s. I wish they had done a better job of restoring the picture quality instead of the rather grainy and washed out version we get here. The audio quality is passable, but not very sharp either.

3727691,5,B001O4KBMI,"This series started when I was about 2 years old. I feel as if I have missed some part of the Paper Chase experience, but I have now recaptured.

This is the series that made me want to be a lawyer,law lecturer. And to date, Contract Law is still my favourite subject.

It is just remarkable how such characters can input on a young mind.",1258761600,,338,4.184615384615385

""The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you, unlike any other schooling you have ever known before.  You teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds.  You come in here with a skull full of mush and if you survive, you leave thinking like a lawyer.""

The above is found at the beginning of each episode of this television series.  This series is based on the novel by John Jay Osborn, Jr. as well as the 1973 movie (directed by James Bridges) of the same name.

It follows the lives of first-year law student Hart (James Stephens) at an unnamed, elite law school and the other members of his study group.  Hart's nemesis is Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman who reprised his Oscar-winning performance from the movie), the world's leading authority on contract law.  (The above opening narrative is uttered by Kingsfield).

Besides Hart, the other members of the study group are Ford (Tom Fitzsimmons), Anderson (Robert Ginty), Bell  (James Keane), Logan (Francine Tacker), and Brooks (Jonathan Segal).  (Note that in the pilot episode, there was O'Conner instead of Logan and this part was played by a different actress.  Also note that J. Segal who played Brooks eventually left the series thus reducing the number of study group members to five.)

This show tackled a number of big issues such as sexual harassment, affirmative action, equal rights for women, and what it's like to be a law student and disabled while also devoting time to other subjects such as cheating, the demands of academia, and romantic entanglements.

On top of this, there is strong acting (especially by Housemen who was aged 76), well-rounded characterizations, and many guest stars who are given memorable roles and an opportunity to really shine in their episodes.  The writing and the story telling are simply great.  (Note that James Bridges, who developed this series for television, wrote two episodes while John Jay Osborn, who was technical advisor, wrote four episodes and co-wrote one episode.)

One thing the series lacks is continuity meaning that new characters have to be introduced and written out in one episode and, as well, all the story lines have to draw to a conclusion before the end credits roll.  This was not the show's fault but how episodic television was written during this time period.

Of all the episodes, there was only two I did not care for.  (In one of these episodes, Houseman does not even appear!)

For show quality alone, this series deserves a solid 5 stars.

Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the picture quality which is variable.  Some episodes are clear, other not so clear.  The colours are a bit faded and there are occasional scratches and spots.  However, the series is still quite viewable.

For picture quality alone, this series deserves, in my opinion, 3 stars.

The audio is better but there are some distortions in a few episodes.  You have to turn up the volume when watching all episodes.  Despite this, the dialog is easy to make out.

For audio quality alone, this series perhaps should be given 4 stars.

My final rating is an average of the above three ratings.

One thing I should mention is each shows length.  It says on the cardboard storage case that each episode is ""one hour long.""  Yes, this was with the commercials.  But in this set, there are no commercials (thank goodness!).  It turns out, when rounding to the nearest minute, that the majority of the episodes are (48 minutes) long with some being either (46 or 47 minutes) long.  (Note that the opening and closing credits combined take between (2 minutes) and (2 minutes, 30 seconds).)

Another thing I would do before watching this series is to watch the excellent movie the series is based on.  The series uses many of the elements found in the movie.  You'll also notice some interesting differences.

There are no extras, no subtitles, and no closed captioning.

Finally, some say this series is only for wannabe lawyers or lawyers.  UNTRUE.  This series is for anybody with intelligence.

In conclusion, in my opinion this is an intelligent, warm, top-notch television series.  In fact, it was hailed by critics as the best new series of that season!  As you can imagine, a show of this calibre was cancelled but fortunately was picked up by a pay-cable network years later.  I'm looking forward to seeing season two!!

3727697,5,B001O4KBMI,"Since this is television, this series of course over-dramatizes the stress and challenges of law school, and some of the plot situations would never occur in real life.  No matter.  It is a fact that law school is a challenging and unique environment, and this series contains enough validity to make it fun and insightful entertainment.  The episodes are several cuts above pretty much any other TV series in terms of their intellectual content, and occasionally manage the difficult trick of being humorous, uplifting, and inspiring at the same time.  That is a difficult trick, but this series manages it repeatedly.  And at all times it is entertaining.

As most viewers know, this series derives from the movie ""The Paper Chase"" starring John Houseman and Timothy Bottoms.  Frankly, I liked the actors in this TV series better than the ones in the film.  James Stephens is perfect as James Hart, the main protagonist, and all of the other actors who play the various students are similarly excellent.  Houseman, of course, reprises his role as Professor Kingsfield for which he has received deserved acclaim.

I trust that we can look forward to Seasons Two and Three of ""The Paper Chase.""  Aficionados such as myself, along with anyone who likes solid entertainment with an intellectual bent, will want to snap them up.

3727720,5,B001O4KBMI,"This great series about a young student's life at Harvard Law School is great for the person who enjoys entertaining relationships mixed with legal messages delivered by a stuffy professor.  It's not perfect--as other reviews note, it does look dated and often the writing is a bit unrealistic, but there has been little else like it ever on television. The closest comparison in tone would be the 1970s show ""The White Shadow,"" which was about a high school basketball coach trying to guide his students, mixed with the quirky camaraderie of a more serious  ""Welcome Back Kotter,"" where goofy multicultural students try to impress their teacher. This doesn't have violence or action; it's not preachy; it just allows the bigger-than-life characters (particularly John Houseman's professor) to speak intelligently and with subtle humor.

The cast is huge--it's hard to believe that network TV back then could afford to employ so many actors.  There are at least eight regulars and others that appear often, plus generous crowds of students in the background as the campus is shown.

Some may think this hasn't aged well because it is really a period piece--it's hard to believe any professor today could get away with saying some of the things Houseman says, and is just as difficult to swallow how naive the new law students were in their first year back then.  But it does reflect pieces of reality from the 1970s, when law students couldn't afford to call home, were intimidated by teachers and each other, and were stuck eating cafeteria food.

One thing that's a bit disappointing is the somewhat stilted writing of creator John Jay Osborne, who is now a law professor in San Francisco.  He wasn't a trained TV writer, but was known for his novel on which the movie and series were based.  He writes a handful of the episodes and had some interesting plots but didn't quite know how to script for TV and at times plot threads go without resolution in the self-contained hours.

Otherwise this is a great buy for those who enjoy a little intellectual stimulation with their nostalgia. Hope the other seasons are released as well.",1249862400,,2133,4.9

Although some episodes lack some of the luster of the overall series, what holds them all together is that towards the end of each Kingsfield comes through. Whether in relation to something 'discovered' by Hart or Logan or Bell or any of the others, the wisdom of learning to think (""I train your minds""), Kingsfield and his students show that learning through the Socratic method prepares a person not to ""think like a lawyer"" but to think like a liver of life. These episodes are priceless.",1249862400,,631,4.693693693693693
3727722,5,B001O4KBMI,"I must have been one of three people who watched the original run on CBS in the late 70s. John Houseman later wrote, correctly, that it was well reviewed and was like by CBS head Bill Paley, but it was up against powerhouse ABC shows ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne and Shirley."" CBS later moved it to the weekend where it began to pick up a little steam, but then dumped it back to the graveyard against ""Happy Days,"" insuring its death. The show was so loved it lived a life in reruns on PBS and elsewhere until Showtime finally picked it up for a few more seasons of new episodes. That series dropped and added a few characters, changed the theme and advanced the plot to cover Hart's remaining years in law school; otherwise, it achieved the same excellence.

Without any extras, Shout presents the original CBS season in full. Time has not been completely kind to the film, as there is some faded quality; one or two episodes look a little more fresh. I wish there had been more an effort for preservation, but over time maybe that will happen. The film is still in good enough quality to not detract from the excellent writing and acting that was the hallmark of this series. It is based on the novel and film of the same name. Anyone who has seen the film will note many episodes in the film made their way into the first season on TV, although it is surprising the shrouding episode that made for such a strong pilot was not from the film but original. Hart and Kingsfield are more accessible on the TV series, although they remain essentially the same characters, particularly Kingsfield. James Stephens and Houseman are outstanding in those roles and carry the series, although the supporting cast are also excellent. I never understood why the cast playing the students never went on to bigger things. (I always thought Tom Fitzsimmons was always underrated; check out ""The Man Who Would Be King"" on Disc 1. Francine Tacker, Robert Ginty and James Keane had similar turns that were outstanding as well.)

It was just a true joy to watch this series all over again. Hopefully, the Showtime episodes will follow, but for now enjoy the highlight of the 1978-79 television season.",1249171200,2,2181,4.618556701030927

3727724,4,B001O4KBMI,"I saw this show when it was first telecast and enjoyed it very much. Thirty years later it's still a good show, but its flaws are more obvious. The show is remarkably naive, chaste, and dewy-eyed, which detracts somewhat from its realism. The scenes in Kingsfield's class are entertaining, but the level of discussion and the manner of presentation seem more appropriate for a high school than a top law school (presumably Harvard). Many of the shows are based on an issue (minority student, handicapped student, sexual harrassment-a particularly awful episode-cheating students, etc.) and the show is addicted to last minute changes of heart in order to bring about a happy ending in 45 minutes. Still, it's a very good show, well worth seeing. Somehow John Houseman manages to dominate the show despite a performance that runs the emotional gamut from A to B.  The rest of the actors are quite good.  The rating above applies to the show, not to the quality of the DVD tranhsfer, which is at times fuzzy and out-of-sync.  I'm sure the problem was the state of the originals, though.  BTW, the actress playing Miss Logan sounds remarkably like Tony Curtis in drag in ""Some Like It Hot.""

What happened in law school was a complete mystery to me, one which I had little or no interest in trying to solve.  Nevertheless,I remember tuning in the pilot episode out of curiosity, and I was hooked from the first five minutes.

Set in a never named but obviously Ivy League university, The Paper Chase followed the vicissitudes of first year law student James Hart, a Midwesterner unaccustomed to the sophistication and traditions of an Eastern law school.  On his first day he ran afoul of the celebrated Professor Kingsfield, and his efforts to regain his standing with the professor and save his law school career were riveting to watch.

After that episode I had an ironclad appointment to watch The Paper Chase every week.  The series had wit as well as drama and never insulted the intelligence of its viewers, something most TV viewers in the 1970s were accustomed to find only on PBS. The actors were really actors, not TV ""stars"", especially John Houseman.  When The Paper Chase was cancelled after one season I was broken hearted and never found its match on commercial TV.

John Jay Osborne, the author of the novel on which the movie was based, wrote some of the TV scripts and was technical consultant for the series, so the classroom scenes present a reasonably accurate picture of contract law (a subject I've been teaching as a law professor for the past twenty years).  Some of the plots are silly, of course, and some of the events would not happen during the first year of law school.  The production is done more cheaply than the movie, so the class and classroom is smaller - but having an entire season to flesh out the character gives John Houseman much more to play with as Professor Kingsfield, and James Stephens makes an acceptable leading man as ""Hart.""  The supporting players are fine as well, although it does seem strange that new students are constantly popping up in this class as the guest-star of the week.  One puts reality aside a bit for a network TV series.  But there are some really good insights into the law student experience, and I've found myself thinking that some of my own 1L's could profit by watching certain episodes.

3727768,5,B001O4KBMI,"Television has become a time machine for me like visiting an old friend and you're able to go back to a time and place. The problem with nostalgia is that maybe the friend isn't as you remember them or you discover it was only the time and place that made you friends. The Paper Chase TV series came along at a formative time of my life and I remember it with fond memories.

While the movie The Paper Chase was more of a 60's parable on the absurdities of the chase after the ephemeral materialistic goals of society, the series is much more about the human stories behind the students, behind the discipline of studying the law, a much more late 70's view point or even a new century point of view.

The series follows James Hart, an idealistic student of the law and his study group through the rigors of an unnamed but prestigious east coast law school, where Hart's nemesis is contracts law Professor Kingsfield. The stories examine aspects of life through the prism of contracts law. The series not only presented dramas but all the elements of life love stories such as when Hart falls in love with Logan. There are humorous episodes such as when Bell decides that Kingsfield is picking on him because of a goofy picture on the seating chart and enlists Hart to help him change the picture and they end up trapped for a weekend in Kingsfield's closet. There's a look at what it's like to be a law student, such as the moot court episode, and issue oriented episodes that present both sides of the issue.

The casting is superb, John Houseman seems to have been born to play Kingsfield, the dignified, unbending law Professor. It's hard to imagine that Houseman had once been a firebrand actor and colleague of Orson Welles. James Stephens perfectly embodies the idealistic eagerness of Hart, Tom Fitzsimmons as Ford, the legacy student with a family tradition to uphold, Robert Ginty (who would later go on to the TV series Baa Baa Black Sheep) as Hart's friend, James Keane as Bell the goofy underdog who everybody underestimates. Keane would later be seen in a lot of movies in the 80's usually as a cop. Francine Tacker as Elizabeth Logan feminist student and occasional love interest to Hart, and Jonathon Segal as Brooks the married student who is on the verge of flunking out and unfortunately Segal's character mirrors the character's place in the show a little too closely and is given short shrift in the series except for the episode, An Act of Desperation. And like a lot of TV series you can find actors in bit parts who go on to bigger things, such as Marilou Henner as a waitress in the pilot episode in a role that probably would have been bigger in the series had she not gone to make Grease, Kim Cattrall shows up pre-Porky's and, of course, Sex In The City.

There aren't any bonus features which was initially a little disappointing but as I watched the episodes the overall quality of the show more than makes up for a making of featurette.

The Paper Chase has always been a quality show produced by James L Brooks and a few of the episodes written by the novel's author John Jay Osborn Jr, it received the fate of a lot of quality shows that have been on TV, cancellation. The show was revived by PBS and future seasons found their way on to the air. So whether you're looking to rediscover an old friend, or make a new one, the first season of The Paper Chase is a good start.",1240012800,6,3406,4.504854368932039
3727769,5,B001O4KBMI,I just finished watching all of the episodes from Season 1.  I would love to see the other three seasons.  Please release them!!!!  Thank you.,1239840000,2,142,4.6
3727780,5,B001O4KBMI,"It's great to see THE PAPER CHASE finally get an official DVD release after all these years.  The series has long been one of my top five favorite TV shows and I'm glad that those who missed the original broadcasts will now get a chance to see and appreciate the academic adventures of James Hart and his fellow law students.
There are many reasons that THE PAPER CHASE stands as one of the best dramas ever seen on television, but its main attraction is definitely the performance of John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield.  His unique delivery and commanding presence make him a truly monumental figure.  Praise should also go to James Stephens, who is outstanding as the quietly intense and ambitious Mr. Hart.  The key to the enduring popularity of both the series and the original movie, though, is the fascinating mix of camaraderie and competition between the characters: friends on one hand, rivals on the other.
One viewer has commented that after seeing the show for the first time since its premiere, the series doesn't live up to his memories, and that the scripts and direction don't measure up to the television dramas of recent years.  In truth, though, this could be said about virtually any older program if you view it strictly with a modern eye.  Every movie or TV show reflects the styles and conventions of the time in which it was produced .  Take the first-season episodes of the original STAR TREK or HAWAII FIVE-O, for example.  By today's standards, some of the dialogue and plot elements may seem dated, simplistic or even silly.  However, this in no way makes the shows any less interesting or enjoyable.  It's best to watch them on their own terms.  Likewise with THE PAPER CHASE: in retrospect it may seem to lack a bit of an edge, and perhaps it didn't realize its full potential, but it's a great series nonetheless.
Those who never saw the episodes produced for Showtime in the early 80's are probably wondering how they compare to the first-year CBS segments included in this new DVD set.  Actually the producers did an excellent job of continuing the story in the same spirit while making logical changes to mirror the progress of the students as they advanced through law school.  In the second year, Hart and Ford leave the dorms and rent a place off campus, while Bell stays behind and becomes Dorm Advisor.  The later episodes tend to have better classroom scenes where the students actually discuss legal concepts and questions, rather than simply stating ""the facts of the case"".  On the negative side, however, the teamwork and friendship between members of the study group, which was a vital element of the first year, is missing from the Showtime productions.
As for Shout Factory's DVD presentation, the set is nicely packaged and contains a helpful booklet containing plot descriptions and credits.  Strangely, only a select number of the episodes appear to have been remastered, but the picture quality is decent throughout and certainly an improvement over the bootleg copies that have been available up to now.  All in all it's a great set of DVD's and a must-have for anyone who likes intelligent and thought-provoking drama.",1239840000,2,3174,4.848148148148148
3727781,3,B001O4KBMI,"Notice that there are quite a few 5-star reviews of this product that were written well before the product hit the shelves.  Most of those glowing reviews are from folks who are gushing about how elated they are to finally get their hands on a show they haven't watched in 30 years.  They are just waxing nostalgic for the good old days.

Well, I saw a few episodes of this show in its first season on TV too.  I liked them a lot, especially the ""Scavenger Hunt"" episode.  But I was twelve years old at the time.  When you are 12 and grew up with only 3 or 4 channels of TV programming, almost every show was good.  You carry those fond memories of watching the show with you through the rest of your years --- until you are in your early forties and watch the show again...

""The Paper Chase - Season 1"" doesn't hold up as well as I hoped it would. It was interesting to revisit the show, but I'm watching the episodes with a far more ""dramatically sophisticated"" eye.  The storylines are fine, but the dialogue and directing styles are dated, thin, and weak compared to what I'm used to now.  Again, good stories but too often the dialogue seems weak.  After watching great drama like ""NYPD Blue"", ""The Wire"", etc, it is hard to watch this late-Seventies series and not snicker a bit at how comparatively hokey it is.  It may not have seemed hokey at the time, but the passage of time has not been good to the show.

The actors are earnest enough, but they are undermined by the now-dated style of televised drama from that era.

I don't remember seeing the show when it was resurrected on Showtime years later.  Maybe those seasons hold up better.  I can't say because I don't know.

Don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that all contemporary dramas are better than the stuff from the Seventies.  There is some stuff on TV today that is pure drivel.  But it just turns out that the first season of ""The Paper Chase"" had an excellent concept but was executed in a style that would not stay fresh this long.  Oddly, the movie still holds up well.

It is fun to watch the show for the nostalgia, that's for sure.  But it isn't the same degree of compelling it might have once been, mostly due to the quality of many shows/series that followed it.",1239580800,12,2246,4.3485576923076925
3727782,5,B001O4KBMI,I hope that the other seasons of The Paper Chase will be available soon.  Thank you.,1239235200,,84,4.25
3727783,4,B001O4KBMI,"As I watch the DVDs that I just received I'm finding myself overjoyed at being able to watch this excellent series again as I've long wanted to be able to get the series on DVD or at least be able to find the series to watch again.  Sadly I've not seen the series available to watch on any of the broadcast or cable television networks that I receive, at least not in many, many years.  As another reviewer notes, 30 years have passed (as I write this) since the series originally aired, and in the intervening time many other shows have come and gone, so it's not that surprising not to have been able to find The Paper Chase available on television.  What is somewhat surprising is that it took as long as it has for the series to become available on DVD.

I remember checking for the availability of this title (and a few other selected favorites that remain unavailable currently) and being disappointed that the best I could get was to sign up for notification that title was being released.  I had long ago done that, and was sad that it seemed that each time I checked back the status hadn't changed and I was still left waiting and wanting.

Finally, in April 2009, the series is out in a 6 disc DVD set from Shout Factory.  6 discs with 22 episodes spread among them.  Sadly the video quality on these DVDs isn't as clean or pristine as one might expect in this modern digital era, with noise apparent throughout the various episodes.  The video on the DVDs basically shows it's age, though not really in a bad way.  Again, this material is 30 years old and was created during a time with less sophisticated recording technology and material.  I'm sure that if this series aired today we'd be enjoying it in high definition with all digital video and audio.

For audio quality these discs are fine, though the material was again created in an era where the technology involved isn't what we have today.

Which brings me back to the material on the discs and the quality of the episodes therein, and that is where these discs truly shine.  The Paper Chase, the Television Series, was some of the most compelling and thought provoking material ever aired on television.  Sadly, it was, as someone else notes here, ahead of its time and perhaps a bit too sophisticated for viewers that would rather watch situation comedies, and later reality television.

I hope that sales of these discs go well and that we'll see the remaining seasons of the series released to disc as well.  I certainly look forward to being able to purchase them when they are releaesd :-)",1239235200,6,2567,4.533622559652929
3727784,5,B001O4KBMI,"Many thanks and cheers to Shout Factory for a long-overdue release of this fantastic series! I've loved ""The Paper Chase"" since I first saw the series as a teenager in the late `70s and unlike most shows from that era, it holds up remarkably well today. This is due primarily to strong ensemble acting, intelligent writing (for the most part), and of course John Houseman's signature role as tyrannical law professor Charles W. Kingsfield.
Even if you're discovering the series for the first time on this DVD set, it's easy to see why it has remained so highly regarded for the last 30 years. It was written and developed by James Bridges (director of the original film) and John Jay Osborn Jr. (author of the original novel), so it retains the tone of the movie.  James Stephens as Minnesotan farm boy James Hart is a much more focused and empathetic character than the one played by Timothy Bottoms in the original film. He's initially nave, but ingenious enough to overcome his first stumbling encounters with his idol Kingsfield in a way that earns the professor's respect and watchful eye for the rest of the year.

The other four key members of Hart's study group are well cast as very different personalities that click strongly as a team. The best episodes of the season are those that feature all five working as a team, but any combination of the characters is equally well played: Tom Fitzsimmons as privileged Franklin Ford III, who has to live up to the reputation of generations of lawyers in his family; James Keane as Willis Bell, who looks like the stereotypical ""lovable lug/mascot"" but who is very sharp and dedicated; Robert Ginty as Tom Anderson, the laid-back California type who's sometimes his own worst enemy; and Francine Tacker as Elizabeth Logan, the passionate and outspoken radical. You can actually get a pretty good snapshot of their characters in the opening credits montage. The five make a strong group that is respected by their class and admired by Kingsfield.

For the first half of the season, the last member of the study group is Jonathan Segal as Jonathan Brooks, a married student who has to struggle much harder than the others to keep up with Kingsfield. Brooks is a much weaker character overall, but his final episode where he crashes and burns (""An Act of Desperation"") is one of the best of the season. Brooks' wife Asheley, though in the opening credits for the first 13 episodes, only appears in 2 or 3 episodes.

Because the main five student characters are so strong, the episodes that center on them are the best. The season stumbles when the focus shifts to the ""guest law student of the week,"" whose conflict usually reflects some hot-button issue or social concern (the student whose studies are affecting his marriage; the mob boss' daughter (!) who falls for Hart; the handicapped student; the minority student who must fight to prove herself, etc.) And of course, we never again see these ""guest students"" before or after their showcase episodes, when logically we should be seeing them in the background during every classroom scene. Thankfully there are only a handful of these episodes; I guess the writers had to fill 22 episodes somehow. When the show returned for The Second Year and The Third Year on Showtime, there was far more emphasis on law school life and the main characters.

For the Showtime episodes, only Stevens, Fitzsimmons and Keane return from the student roster. It's never explained what happened to the characters of Anderson and Logan (though Anderson is name-checked in the series finale, ""Graduation""), creating a huge unaddressed question in the series as a whole. Neither character would have just left after one year. In that sense, this First Season is the best of the three because even with a fair share of lesser quality episodes, it still has the chemistry of the entire study group.

The writers also deftly manage to humanize Kingsfield without weakening the character - letting us occasionally see the ""man behind the curtain"" that never takes anything away from the complete authority with which he rules the students and the entire university. This is a testament to Houseman, who was always concerned about maintaining the integrity of the character.

This is evident in the season's big clunker episode, ""A Case of Dtente."" Here, Hart falls for a visiting Russian gymnast (Huh?) and nearly causes an international incident. Houseman reportedly hated this script so much he refused to appear in it, so they had to bring in Pernell Roberts (a few months prior to ""Trapper John, M.D."") as a visiting professor. Roberts is good, but the episode is terrible!

Many obvious changes were made after the pilot episode, all for the better. In the pilot, the students are too button-down; Anderson and Bell are way too intense; and Logan isn't there - the female character, played by a different actress, is the prim O'Connor. Logan is a much stronger character. Hart doesn't work in Ernie's Tavern yet, but in a more stereotypical pizza parlor (with a pre-""Taxi"" Marilu Henner as a waitress). The tavern has more character, and is more appropriate for the Harvard-esque setting of the series, so that's a good change too.

The season's half-dozen best episodes are:

Scavenger Hunt - The class is assigned a make-or-break final exercise that pits all the study groups against each other.

The Clay-Footed Idol - While researching an old case, Hart's group finds indications that a young Kingsfield might have been paid off to throw the case.

Moot Court - Bell and an overly disciplined ""guest student of the week"" face Hart and Logan in the annual Moot Court competition.

The Seating Chart - Bell and Hart are accidentally locked in Kingsfield's office closet over a long weekend when Bell tries to replace his goofy picture on the seating chart.

An Act of Desperation - A desperate Jonathan buys the question for Kingsfield's upcoming midterm, putting the rest of the unwitting study group in the position of having cheated too.

The Tables Down at Ernie's - Hart is pitted against Kingsfield when the study group tries to prevent the demolition of Ernie's Tavern.

I almost decided to go to law school just because of this series. Back then, and even more so today, it was great to have a TV series that focused on people devoted to the pursuit of excellence in ANYTHING, without cynicism or selfish motivations...and one that showed how amazing it would be to have someone like Kingsfield in your life who epitomizes everything you admire and want to strive for.

Please go out and buy this great series, whether for nostalgia's sake or even if you've never seen it. If you like it, e-mail Shout Factory and let them know, so they can see that there's enough support to release the rest of the series.",1239148800,7,6801,4.854184641932701
3727785,5,B001O4KBMI,"How many TV shows today do you find both entertaining AND intelligent?

""The Paper Chase"" is one such show and its DVD release is terrific news.

The show lasted only one season on CBS thanks to strong network competition from ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne and Shirley"", but that one season brought the show critical acclaim as the best new series of the 1978-79 season.

Following its demise, SHOWTIME brought the show back with new episodes making ""The Paper Chase"" the first series ever canceled by a broadcast network and then continued by a cable network.

It was that good.

I wasn't alone in writing to FOX Home Entertainment in hopes of getting a DVD release. Fox did not think there was enough of an audience to make it profitable.

Many thanks to Shout Factory for making it happen!  Let's hope the sales for Season One show the company that there is a market for the release of  the entire series.

The most compelling element in the series is the same as that of the movie, namely John Houseman's Professor Charles W. Kingsfield.  It is this character that provides the solidity to the series by towering over all the other actors and providing a focal point.

The stories are well-written and interesting and do not disappoint.  Anyone who enjoys a good dramatic series will rapidly become engaged with the series.  The only disappointment is that it is one season one that is being released, but time will tell whether the other seasons will follow suit and make their way to DVD.

I have one show that I taped on VHS back in 1979, which I had been watching, hoping and praying for the DVD set to be released. And now it has!! This is simply television drama at its best, the ensemble, headed by the great John Houseman,reprising the character of the fascinatingly brilliant curmudgeon Kingsfield, who both teaches and torments his students to become the best that they can be, is a tour de force acting triumph. His Academy Award was well deserved. His presence in the series gives a bit more humor and interest, building the character as the episodes progress, than that of the motion picture. James Stephens, in my opinion, is the quintessential Hart, giving more sensitivity and naivete than the portrayal by Bottoms, with a bit more of a moral edge. The rest of the students in the study group are also much more effective and likeable than those in the motion picture. I felt the motion picture study group was very one dimensional, we only saw arrogant Harvard kids. But the television series study group is a bit more diverse, allowed to develop into interesting personalities we grew to love, with lots of humor and pathos, especially the character of the luckless Willis Bell --remember ""Liberty"" Bell?. One of the best episodes in this set is ""The Seating Chart"" which illustrates the understated and comedic talent of James Keane, who played Bell. All of the actors are excellent and blend well as an ensemble. I can't wait to purchase this set, it is well worth the money.

8329540,5,B001O4KBMI,"This show should be seen by all high school students in some type of AP class--selected episodes, especially the first season.  Halt & Catch Fire might be the closest show on today that tracks with this series, also set in the 80's.  The storytelling is far greater than this show reflecting the times  There has been huge progress in storytelling from 1980!

There are so many ways to use this show.  One obvious is the comparison-contrast based on technology.  What was life like without cell phones and computers?  What are the similarities?  How does technology enhance and distract from quality of life?  People were more dependent on others, collecting data took much more time and developed thinking skills lost today.  Patience today was not experienced as patience in 1980--you just had to go to the library or use a pay phone which required time management skills and delayed gratification.  This is totally lost today.  You will see episodes on what was culturally relevant, especially the role of women and the beginning of single parent homes.  There are almost no episodes on drug use, medications, violence, gangs, and sexual situations.

The acting is at times cheesy.  As noted, a guest star is in one epsidoe and gone the next.  The show veered off course when it became too involved in cultural issues (single mom in season two can't get child care) rather than stick closely to the main characters like in season one.  Another goof was changing actors from season one to two.  Unlike almost all series, there was a few years between each season and key players were lost and that hurt the show.  Producers should have really established the key players before going into stories with guest actors.  In these episodes, the B story was better because they had to do with the law.  In season one, Logan was great and the story where she works w/a legal assistance program in prison really a strong episode.  If you do not understand the gap in years between seasons, the first reaction is why did so many key players leave.

Lastly, why this show is so significant, especially today is the loss of critical thinking skills.  Kingsfield always brings students back to reason over emotion.  One excellent epsidoe in S2 is where one law professor wrote a book and is doing the TV circuit.  Kingsfield is offended by this but today, this is normal--it's called Cable News (CNN, MSNBC, Fox).  We see here how a younger viewer can think in order to be creditable, especially as a female, you need to be beautiful, wear tight bright colored outfits, go to law school, be able to make a point in 30 seconds, smile for the camera, and then be able to do a guest spot on The View.  Life was far less tribal than it is today where thinking is irrelevant to agreeing with your tribe.  Sports has always had this, but today it is common in politics and is bleeding into all aspects of life!  Kingsfield represents old school values in a changing culture, especially the role of women breaking into a man's world like law school!",1520640000,,3032,4.7091254752851714

I had a chance to buy Season 1 and to watch it and enjoyed every episode. I especially liked how Professor Kingsfield throws an imaginary funeral shroud over Hart, meaning hes dead to the Professor. We later learn that Kingsfield does that to a first year law student each year. Hart is asked to join a study group and insists on doing the Contracts outline while the group is reluctant since they believe that Hart is ""dead"" to Kingsfield. Not willing to be dead to Kingsfield, Hart comes up with the idea of wearing a real shroud to class which annoys Kingsfield so much that he walks over to Hart and literally removes the shroud at which point Hart proudly starts to answer the Professors question. You can see just the hint of a little smile on the Professors face as this was clearly the first time that anyone had been able to have the shroud lifted.

The first season was fun to watch. In one episode Hart meet a President of the Law Review and she offers to help him and he eventually rejects the the offer preferring to do the work himself. I also liked the episode in which Hart falls for a woman who turns out to be Kingsfield's daughter. It was also interesting to see Kingsfield at Ernies Tavern and we see the table that Kingsfield carved his name on. We even meet Ernies father who ran the tavern when Kingsfield was in law school.
