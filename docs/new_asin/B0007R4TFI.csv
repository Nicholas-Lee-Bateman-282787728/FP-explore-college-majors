2235445,4,B0007R4TFI,"I saw this anime in school with acouple of friends of mine. I thought it was really cool. The story, blood and guts was awesome. This movie's not your typical saturday morning cartoon. It's mainly focussed for more of a mature audience'es. I don't suggest a 10yr old to watch the film.

This is also one of the animes that also got me into the whole anime trend. I had to buy it the next day because I liked it that much. The Story line is abit slow but not that solw. Also it's a bit of old schoolish, it has your 80's style animation. But this dosn't take away from the movie at all. I suggest buying the whole collection, you get your moneys worth. It has tons of extras. It's an awesome DVD set to add to your collection. You will not be disappointed.",1132704000,7,755,4.171232876712328
2235446,3,B0007R4TFI,"I hate to admit it, but the Ninja Scroll TV series compares little to what has become a solid member of the anime royalty, Ninja Scroll. The animation is sloppy and only barely compares to that of its movie companion, and characters, both the reaccurring and the new, are very generic (ninja, magical princess, thief, old monk). Not only that, but the story is jumbled and difficult to follow in succession. Truth is you can watch the first two and the last two episodes and get the entire worth of this series. It's one bonus is the inexpensive price-tag for a boxed set.",1128988800,8,572,4.563106796116505
2235447,2,B0007R4TFI,"This series isn't terrible but I think that if you were expecting something similar to Ninja Scroll the Movie you may be disappointed. The things I liked were the animation, it was actually better than the movie in this respect. The monsters were very inventive, a few of their characters seem to be better developed than the good guys. But don't get too attached to them because each monster is seldom in more than one episode. That's what one of my main problems is, the editorial reviewers said that there were great fighting scenes, but I have to disagree. Jubei quickly dispatches nearly every monster with one of three moves. Occasionaly he has a battle that goes longer, but that is mainly just an excuse to show Jubei parrying a sword while one of the other characters makes some bone-head mistake and gets in even more trouble. I sometimes had to use my imagination to figure out how the Kimon clan's attacks could do anything, for instance; one had an attack where the screen turned black and white, other than that I can't imagine it did anything else.

  The character development on the protagonist side is probably the biggest let down. Jubei isn't the super-cool reluctant hero from the first movie, in this he's kind of a G.I. Joe bland unexpressive grunt. Dakuan seems to have had a stroke since the movie because he doesn't seem fight or give any insight like he used to. And the Light Maiden is pretty forgetable, I doubt anything she says or does will affect you in any way, shape, or form. And the other companion (I think his name is Tsubuki) gains so much contempt from every viewer I think you would forgive Jubei for killing him as he causes more problems than the monsters usually. The soundtrack is awful, it is all anime-raver-trance that was popular almost seven years ago. My final minor gripe is the use of tons of electronics used in this movie... isn't it supposed to take place in the 13th century? Well I'm not sure, but I didn't see very much technology in the movie.",1124841600,10,2003,4.605042016806722
2235448,5,B0007R4TFI,"This series, i think, follows on after the movie. Jubei, after desroying the eight devil's but losing Kagero, finds himself in yet another adventure as his swordsmanship has become famous. He promises a ninja to keep the sacred Dragon stone safe and to give it to the light maiden. But two waring ninja clans also want the stone. Now Jubei must keep the saftey of his new friends (including a return for Dakoan)and the Dragon stone until they find the light maiden. With superb animation, breathtaking battles, and a whole host of characters that really fit, this series has it all for the action anime/manga lover. A must have for all anime fans everywhere and i would definitley recomend it to anyone.

Buy it and enjoy.",1124323200,17,722,4.73015873015873
2235449,5,B0007R4TFI,"This collection has everything. All three volumes, the series, an action figure, a bonus dics with extras features. Ninja Scroll was made in 1994. The artwork is perfect in this anime and they fight well.",1119657600,3,204,4.857142857142857
2235450,5,B0007R4TFI,"This series is a great follow-up to the classic film.  For those who love action, Ninja Scroll has that and more!  Even beyond the many and varied monsters that the protagonist Jubei encounters, what's truly amazing about the series is the balance between action, drama, and humor.  I've been watching anime for years, and I was still blown away Ninja Scroll TV!

Any fan of great packages will appreciate the treatment of the box set.  The artwork (which you can't see from the outside) is gorgeous and vivid, and the Limited Edition version comes in a shiny silver case with a really sweet Jubei action figure.  The bonus fourth disc has some cool stuff, the best being a video tour of Mad House Animation Studio, and the audio commentary tracks a close second.  I'm really pleased with this set, and I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of either Ninja Scroll or cool anime sets in general.",1119398400,10,893,4.613924050632911
2235451,5,B0007R4TFI,"This box set is an ultimate treat for any anime lover, especially this Ninja Scroll fan.  Since the release of The Series I have been anticipating a collection like this.  And this was definitely worth the wait.  The box set includes all 13 episodes of The Series along with a bonus disc.  The bonuses are cool, but I really enjoyed the tour of Mad House, I'd love to work there.

The Limited Version includes a metal tin that's really cool and a really detailed action figure of Jubei, who looks ready to take on G.I. Joe.  But the best part has to be the images on the interior case.  They include several colorful depictions of Jubei in action, yes there is a lot of red ink.

I recommend this box set to any anime fan, especially all of you Ninja Scroll lovers.  Even if you have some of the individuals, this box set is too cool to pass up and a definite centerpiece of any anime fans collection.....",1119398400,11,905,4.339285714285714

2235457,3,B0007R4TFI,"This series is a good Price and value but it is not as good as the movie. The Movie was great. It is hard to describe what made the movie work. Maybe it was a combination of the storyline, action sequences, and characters, but it all came together with a classic ending.

It looked like it was opened carefully then put back together.  The sticker closing the tin was removed and it appears to have been like that for awhile because it was a little dirty where the sticker had been. Also the plastic wrap around the product was intact but opened at the bottom.  Basically it looked like someone bought it, opened it very carefully so they could watch it and put it back together and then resell it.  Everything works there aren't any scratches the dvd plays fine and I'm satisfied with my purchase.

2235472,5,B0007R4TFI,These really are just a continuation of the Ninja Scroll original movie. They have the same types of characters with super powers that Jubei must contend with to help his new found friends. The anime quality is quite good and the voice acting isn't bad either.

2235473,4,B0007R4TFI,"Ok dumb puns aside and cute character name usage discarded, this is a solid anime series if there ever was one and does what every series should do, leaves me wanting more. Is it perfect? No, but it's quite good. The formula for Ninja Scroll the series never varies much, plot moves along, Jubei meets enemies, you get chopped suei villains for breakfast lunch and dinner. Tons of innocents die so don't get too attached and there are quite a few surprise twists courtesy of Master Kibagami and friends. Characters are interesting although some are quite undeveloped, something quite common for some anime series including the still excellent Ninja Scroll movie. The artwork is excellent unlike some other series that felt rushed (Record of Lodoss War: Tales of the Heroic Knight). The fight scenes are excellent and you can't help but love the action even if the plot is not the most amazing. Regardless of its short comings, this is still excellent anime and if you want to check out something that isn't live acting and worth the price of admission, this is a fine fine choice.",1216512000,,1080,4.780748663101604
2235474,4,B0007R4TFI,"My husband had seen the movie and really wanted to see the series.

I would say that its an okay series. Some of the characters annoy me, and some of the stuff that happened. While its a very graphic anime, and one I recommend that you not put on if there are going to be younger children around (because of a few bloody scenes and one that ""suggests"" rape), its good for older anime fans.

While it wasn't as good as the movie, I wouldn't write it off completely. Its still decent and we don't regret having gotten it.

Oh...and the ""action figure"" it comes with...don't get your hopes over that. When we opened the package, with in minutes, the hand holding the sword FELL OFF! It's only a little piece of plastic glued into a slot and will break off easily, so don't handle the figure at all. And its also about two inches tall, and not very impressive at all. It adds nothing really at all to the sale of this product. We ended up throwing it out shortly after getting the DVD set because the arm broke off, the figure wouldn't stand up right on its own, and it looked like the kind of toy I could go and get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store.",1199404800,2,1161,4.2207207207207205

2235476,5,B0007R4TFI,"Long story short, this is a weird series. Both in terms of plot and in terms of character design. But, in the end, it works. I did end up enjoying the series despite its obvious quirks...

The final ending seemed like a little bit of a cop-out, but in general, the series was pretty good. Animation was ""current"" and fluid, story was relatively interesting even if it did seem to start slowly...

So, I'd give it a thumbs up for anyone who likes anime. DVD features are decent. Video was good, sound was good.

I wouls Highly recommend this series to any Ninja Scroll lover!!! The action is just as awesome as the movie, and the blood is to die for!!! Five stars hands down.",1159056000,15,492,4.301075268817204
2235479,2,B0007R4TFI,"Thats right! When I watch this I see heavy influences of western animation which for one make question wether this is an anime or a western cartoon that was created just to be played on cartoon network.

Putting the style aside this would still seem like a kid's cartoon with a simple plot, little character development and the basic formula for an episode being;

Bad guy encounter, Fight (+ Metal guitars), Bad guy defeated, Jubei Moves along... till another bad guy wants a fight and the process is repeated. This can be entertaining if you don't demand much from the show. But predictable fights equal no suspense... and ultimatley no care for what happens next.

The Music ""oh god the music!"" since when did they have electric guitars in feudal japan. The music isn't authentic to match the times of Jubei's adventures, its an awful clash of repetetive grunge guitar riffs, and it usually kicks in when there's a fight... I guess the director wanted to pump the action scenes up using this approach with their choice of music. It sounds very average, with synth sounds emulating pan pipes etc.

For over 4 episodes I kept hoping for something to hook me in, something to help me forget about the monotomy of encounters. But I couldn't use any more of my time on this series it fell greatly below my expectations and couldn't help feeling the main target audience for the show were early teens. So I felt like I was treated like a kid (in a condesending manner) by series. But I really can't understand why they would choose to make such a series with such a target audience. I mean, the film was an 18 so this series just made no sense to me at all.

I ask alot from my anime so I am quite demanding. If you don't have the same concerns for anime as I do, there's a chance you can find something entertaining here. Though anime's such as Blue Gender makes this 'cartoon' seem like childs play.

Yes, I bought the whole series but I don't have to watch it all. In the 5 months past since I bought it I still haven't.",1149638400,7,2020,4.46070460704607

They seem to have a more Alien and Robotic power than the historic type abilities. I won't go into very many detail's, simplely because any true Anime fan will purchase this anyway. I will admit the Artistic value of the series is excellent, Although some charecters seem younger while others seem older. I suggest a try it before you buy it.

8050819,1,B0007R4TFI,"Ninja Scroll (the movie) ranks up there with Akira and Ghost in the Shell in terms of gateway-drug anime. I remember, in the mid-90's, being blown away by Akira. But Ninja Scroll is what got me hooked on anime and prompted me to scour the world looking for more. This series resembles nothing of the film. I'd be okay with a fresh approach, but this is an uninspiring product and takes its place as a leader in low-quality anime. I won't crap on it too hard. I believe there's an audience for everything. My goal is to help steer away those who are bothered by low quality, regurgitated themes, plastic characters, and thin storylines. Here we go:

***PROS***

ACTION
There are some ninja battles. They are poorly drawn, lousy with two-frame movements and one-hit-kill lazy choreography, and not reminiscent of the vicious style showcased in Ninja Scroll (film). The action is still there, but doesn't hold a candle to 90% of other anime. Jubei swings his sword once a battle (sometimes twice) to kill his foes. His single swing is also a long-range attack, so it doesn't matter where the villain is, they're dead. If that satisfies you, then great! They try to amass a crew of villains, each with a unique power (much like the 8 Devils of Kimon from the movie). A few of them are intriguing, but are used unimaginatively. The story resembles the thinnest of video game quests. Let's find the Dragon Stone. You can follow the plot from the kitchen while you cook and never miss a thing. (That can be a plus.)

***CONS***

ANIMATION
The darkness of the film is nowhere to be found in this series. The visuals are abrasively bright with vivid colors from the Pokmon palette. There's only one level of shading used in most scenes, which makes the characters look like two-dimensional cutouts. Jubei's clothes are missing detailing, which makes him look a bag of potatoes. Two-frame movements, choppy animation, and pathetic gimmicks attempt to make fights feel epic, but only succeed in letting animators avoid drawing out battles. A slash cuts the screen, then a body lies there to inform the viewer that the attack was successful. I expect a lot more from Japanese animation, and I think most fans do, too.

CHARACTERS
The cast of this show is for ages 14 and below. While Jubei is not bad, he is joined by a token tough female who needs help but won't admit it and a punk street thief who carries about as much charm with him as Jar Jar Binks. The master villain is a Doctor Robotnic Buddha mixed with a Harley Davidson.

STORY
Single track, basic storylines can work if executed with purpose. This story, however, is about as intriguing and thought-provoking as playing a game of Candy Land sober. Find the Dragon Stone, stop the bad guys, and stumble all over a bland world while engaging in side quests to satisfy the worst of regurgitated fables. Fine for kids, but not for Ninja Scroll.

MUSIC
Horrible grunge/rock that has no place in feudal Japan. Jarring and pushy.

This show is just a mis-marketed piece of work. The title needs to be replaced. Call it ""Dragon Stone"" and park it next to Bleach and Naruto. Just don't confuse it with Ninja Scroll, because this series is its opposite. If you want a ninja series that's adult, full of fantastic battles, gore, and twisted ninjas endowed with special abilities, watch Basilisk. If you like a series that's colorful, action-packed, adult, and funky, watch Samurai Champloo. If you want a youthful, fun ninja adventure with some plain characters, watch Bleach or Naruto. There are better versions of EVERYTHING. This is the lowest doppelganger of them all. If you haven't seen it yet and are bothered by what I've described above, then save your money and the health of your neck; if you get this, you'll be shaking your head for hours.

LIST OF BETTER NINJA/SAMURAI TITLES:
- BASILISK
- KUROZUKA
- SAMURAI CHAMPLOO
- SENGOKU BASARA
- SAMURAI X: TRUST AND BETRAYAL

I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",1381968000,17,4090,4.715686274509804
