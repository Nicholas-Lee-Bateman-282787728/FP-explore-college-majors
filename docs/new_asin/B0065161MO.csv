4955623,1,B0065161MO,"I LOVE Formula 1 racing.  I have every year of the annual reviews and finally decided to move into the 21st century.  So I ordered a 1080p 46"" LCD TV AND A Blu-Ray player with Surround Sound system, all all so that I could order and watch Sebastien Vettel and Fernando Alonso in high definition.  The Blu-Ray discs did not specify, anywhere in the Amazon listing, a Region.  It only said Unrated.  So I ordered it.  Turns out to be Region 2, unwatchable in my new Blu-Ray system, on my new TV, bought exactly to watch this Blu-Ray disc.  In each email from f-n MovieMars, they blame me.  They keep saying, in generic form letters, it's labeled Region 2.  Even in their latest email, they sent a copy of the listing.  It doesn't list the Region code anywhere.

They don't even lie well!

UPDATE: I was mistaken, MovieMars did list the Region AFTER the Customers Bought With section and AFTER the Bought With Other Items sections.  Essentially, I was expected to wade through two sales pitches for other titles, before they would allow me to get to critical product information.  OK, I'm a stupid consumer and yes, MovieMars is a sly company.  But consumers can only vote with their dollars.  Do you really want to reward these people with your dollars?",1346025600,6,1251,4.592760180995475

4955625,1,B0065161MO,"I'm a big F1 fan and was really excited about this BD. Finally I got it, but it's coded for European region, so I can't watch it. Should've listen to the person who wrote his review instead of Amazon.",1338854400,13,200,4.153846153846154
4955626,4,B0065161MO,"First let me start by saying I collect the F1 FIA Season Review DVD's so it was a must to get this one.  I was a little skeptical when I bought this one that it was going to be boring because I watched every race and saw Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull Racing pretty much have the championship wrapped up in 5-6 races.  Once again though they pulled it off and made every race entertaining by concentrating on all of the rumors and the midfield battles going on, because there was no excitement going on at the top.  Definitely a must have for a serious Formula One fan.",1338249600,6,568,4.2407407407407405

8493034,5,B0065161MO,"Formula One is only a shadow of its glory days of the 60's, 70's, 80's and early 90's. Granted, the cars are safer now. But, excessive regulations, irrational & erratic governance, loss of classic European venues and race tracks in the middle east have ruined the sport. Watching this series is like reliving those glorious days. Enjoy this series immensely.",1479600000,,358,4.983333333333333

It's comes on and bitches about the ""Wrong Region Code"" = Houston we have a Problem. Oh well, $12 for some basic education = thanks, but no thanks & worse things happened.

8493039,3,B0065161MO,"I originally bought this without knowing (due to lack of clear labeling on Amazon or on the case itself) that it is the European region disc... Thanks to a great multi-region Blu-ray player I found right here on Amazon though, I can now enjoy any BD or DVD from anywhere on earth =D

The good: This is a 2-disc release and the quality is very good (as good as the source was, anyway).  It even includes some nice intros of each location narrated by Will Buxton (who I wish would replace Leigh Diffey during the races).

The lacking: I'm not pleased that they didn't include the pole lap for each race in the onboard cameras section.  Mostly it's a mix of different stuff, maybe the start of a race, maybe something from practice... but what I really want to see (especially in this era of endless handicapping of the cars in terms of fuel load and artificially degrading tires) is the one time in the weekend when the cars are going flat out on the limit - the best qualifying lap.  So far in Disc 1 I've seen only one complete qualifying lap and I don't think it was even the pole.  Vettel lapped Monaco faster than ever in history, but alas, we don't get to see that here.",1383868800,,1174,4.337899543378995

8493041,4,B0065161MO,"Having gone through quite an ordeal to be able to watch this disc I'll share what you need to know to watch this in North America.

1) Region Coding - Locked to Region B. To the best of my knowledge there are no Blu-ray players in North America that can be hacked to bypass region coding AND convert 1080i50 > 1080i60 on the fly, which you'll need to do to get this to display on your HDTV unless you have a multi-system HDTV that can handshake with 1080i50 signals...over 99% of HDTV owners likely do not have a multisystem TV although apparently many Vizio HDTV's will display 50Hz content.

I don't believe Amazon wants to advertise how to break region coding on discs, so lets just say you're going to have to figure out a way to bypass region coding, as a clue let me say you're going to probably have to buy blank BD-R DL's (2 @ 50GB discs) and have a Blu-ray Burner to use with your PC which also requires Blu-ray burning software.

2) 1080i50 - while the vast majority of movies are encoded at 1080p24 for the EU market and will play on every Blu-ray player on the planet providing there is no region coding, sporting and concert events on Blu-ray in the UK/EU are different and many can be encoded at 1080i50, instead of 1080i60 which would be used in North America. This is similar to the way DVD's are encoded at 576i50 (PAL) in EU vs. 480i60 (NTSC) for USA although in the case of Blu-ray the resolution will be the same (1920x1080). The majority of TV's will not accept a 1080i50 signal and the majority of Blu-ray players will either a) not play a 1080i50 signal or b) not convert a 1080i50 signal to 1080i60 (some players will just play the 1080i50 signal straight, which is useless to most people)

Samsung, LG and Oppo's blu-ray players all convert 1080i50 to 1080i60 on the fly. I ended up picking up a used Samsung BD-D5700 for $50 in order to watch my F1 2011 Season Review. I consider myself a huge F1 fan, have been to 11 Montreal races in a row and thanks to my PVR have watched every Qualy and Race session for several years and a few practice sessions online but the quality of the latter is usually brutal. Having removed region coding and got a player that converts 1080i50 > 1080i60 on the fly I was finally able to enjoy this Blu-ray on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-VIERA-TC-P50GT50-50-Inch-1080p-600Hz-Full-HD-3D-Plasma-TV/dp/B00752VKU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic VIERA TC-P50GT50 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TV</a>&nbsp;and it was worth the wait!

Blu-ray Picture: The picture quality on this disc is astoundingly good. It was hard to find a single instance on the disc where you'd notice pixelation or macroblocking and say ""oh, terrible job"". Remember the absolutely brutal job they did on the 2006 DVD review? Ugh! None of that here, it put the regular HD broadcast to shame. Seeing all the tracks in immaculate HD is breathtaking, the night shots of Singapore, the clarity of the pit stops, just stunning. 10/10.

Blu-ray Audio: The disc promised high resolution lossless dts-hd Master Audio, but there was none! Instead we get DVD-quality lossy 448 Kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 - it's not terrible, some of the surround effects are really well done and the balance throughout is consistent and enveloping, but it's encoded ridiculously loud I noticed, I watch this disc over 10dB quieter on my receiver than any other Blu-ray I own. I was really looking forward to the sounds of F1 in 24-bit dts-ma, hopefully the 2012 disc doesn't have this omission.

Blu-ray Features: This disc is chock-a-block full of extra features. Some are better than others, one has an audio muck-up (F1 in HD) where you need to manually select the secondary audio to avoid hearing the Caterham featurette's audio. The Spa footage is very cool to watch, but I wish they had covered the entire first lap from Schumacher's on-board camera.

I docked the product one star for the audio screw-up, but as a product altogether it's magic. I see no point to Universal locking this to Region B, that's just stupid. There was no other Blu-ray release of this anywhere, the only reason for region coding is to protect distribution rights in other countries but if no-one release it, what's the point?

Amazon UK has the 2012 Blu-ray listed for release next week, I hope they are correct in listing it for Region A and B, and I hope we get dts-ma this time. The season overall was much more exciting than 2011 and it will be exciting to relive great moments like Hamilton winning at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and becoming the 7th winner in 7 races, you can't ask for a better start. The finish could have been a little better, I'm sure we'd all have loved to see Vettel, Alonso and Raikkonen all entering the final race in Interlagos within 10pts of each other but still I""m glad it took the final race to decide the outcome and Seb certainly drove very well after that clash with Senna, I really thought that was the end.

Anyway, hopefully this helps you if you still want to acquire the 2011 Blu-ray and need some help in figuring out how you're going to watch it.",1357171200,2,5141,4.7212931995540695
8493042,5,B0065161MO,"This is a great concise recap of the 2011 FIA Formula One season.  The coverage in terms of time for each race is just right, capturing the racing highlights at each venue on the circuit.  Also, really enjoy the onboard camera views and engine sound(s) with no commentary!  Would enjoy seeing more pre-race grid, paddock and garage interactions of the teams along with overview/highlights of each venue...these could be part of the ""Special Features"" or bonus footage.  Could also include some area sight-seeing, cultural, etc...things to take in while making a long weekend of racing at these fantastic and varied race locations around the world - again as add-ons in the ""Special Features"" (optional viewing) section.  Great Product - recommend for all F-1 race enthusiast!!",1356998400,,776,5.176
