5399569,4,B00A83061M,A nice collection. I enjoyed the idea of a all women world and how this type of set up would play out.

5399574,3,B00A83061M,"To be blunt, this is an analogue of Sengoku Basara with a female cast.  It takes place during the same time period and has the same basic cast of characters; it also has a noticeable lack of good voice acting.  To be fair, though, I have heard/seen much worse.  Brittney Karbowski put the same energy into this role as she did Black Star and Yamada (though her performance here lacks any sort of memorable quality thanks to the part itself).  The bottom line is that this is very middle-of-the-road and can be missed on the first few passes unless you really need to kill time.",1364169600,6,577,4.466666666666667
5399575,1,B00A83061M,"Given Sentai's licensing habits, I wasn't really surprised that they picked this one up, though hearing it was getting the full dub + Bluray treatment did surprise me. Probably one of the bigger wastes of money in the recent anime industry.
Anyways, as my title suggests, this is a ""nothing"" show. Another in a line of ""what if warring-state-era generals were girls?"" kind of shows, only this one -again- does absolutely nothing. The setting is a warring-states-era Japan world that is only populated by women (don't ask, there's no answer). The cover-art suggests that this may be a fun fanservice romp, but there is very very little. In fact, I could only think of a couple moments that even needed to be censored on the broadcast. And for having the title ""Battle Girls,"" there is very little battling going on. Just dumb, senseless competitions, a 'ghost stories' episode that is so boring it hurts, companions getting jealous of each other, etc. It finally got action packed in the later half, but it took about 7 or 8 episodes to finally get there, and then the fighting wasn't even that good. I never got around to finishing this show, because what would be the point in that?
In the end, whether you're looking for story, characterization, action, or even shameless fanservice, this show has nothing for you. There are several shows like this, and the ones that I've seen at least offer SOMETHING for at least one type of audience. This show is a complete waste of everyone's time and money. Probably why the Bluray sales in Japan were abysmal. If I could give it zero stars, I would.",1363478400,16,1592,4.73021582733813
5399576,2,B00A83061M,"Hideyoshi is a lazy middle school girl. One day she is taken away to a parallel universe inhabited only by women. She meets a warrior named Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is after the pieces of a legendary set of armor. It is said that whoever obtains the armor will conquer the world. Hideyoshi gets involved with Nobunaga and tags along with her on the quest to unite the country.

This anime was a big disappointment for me. The first thing that bothered me was the main character. She is dumb, annoying, and whiny. Brittney Karbowski voices her, and she's very hard to listen to. Normally, Brittney Karbowski does a good job most of the time, but her character in this is whiny, shrill, and barley tolerable. She's a far cry from Icaros in Heaven's Lost Property or Ayu from Kanon.

The story is pretty mush a waste. Nothing really happens in this series. There are a few decent fights, but most of this anime is just fluff. The battle at the end, that was supposed to be the climax, is a major let down. Most of the voice actors, the animation, and the soundtrack are all pretty good. That's all it has going for it. Good production quality. It's a shame that Sentai sees fit to dub half baked shows like this and produce excellent shows without dubbing them. If you're looking for fan service and yuri, this anime has it. If you want good characters and a interesting story, look somewhere else. I can't recommend this anime to anyone. It simply a waste of time.",1362355200,26,1460,4.505660377358491
8548130,4,B00A83061M,"Bonkers, whacky and not lacking in humor. An alternate dimension where all the Japanese warlords are girls...and frankly all the people in that timeline are girls. Don't ask. While the story is solid and the ideas good for a laugh, the English dub is something to steer away from. It's not knocking the voice actors, but the English VA of Hideyoshi is all whine and no cheese with ear-stabbing qualities",1523577600,,403,4.771428571428571

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: A simplistic anime that takes the viewer back to the feudal period of Japan. If you enjoy samurais and the like, this anime will be a treat. The plot is simplistic and the cast of characters are interesting, sexy, and skilled in combat. This helps provide a nice cohesion of action and fan-service. The character development and silly situations also help add to the entertainment value, as well.

- Analysis: Since there is an emphasis on socializing, this infers to the fact that life heavily revolves on the interactions of others, regardless of their perceived significance. Essentially, it is almost impossible to get through life without bonds; as people need to rely on others, even those that think they are independent.

The past may seem far, but it is one of the main experiences that shapes a person's personality and character. The past helps serves as a reminder of various experiences so that we may learn from them. Such as things to condone or refute. While the past may seem irrelevant to many, it actually isn't. Granted we can't go back in time, this anime does address that people generally stay the same or will often attempt to change history. Hence history repeating itself.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 13 episodes on 3 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and some fan-service.
