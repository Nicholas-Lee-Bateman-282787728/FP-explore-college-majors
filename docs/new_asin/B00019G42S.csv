1982279,5,B00019G42S,This has become one of my toddler daughter's favorite videos. She adores Peter Rabbit and all the other wonderful stories included on the DVD. Beatrix Potter was a wonderful painter and story-teller. This little treasure will be a classic for many years to come.,1387584000,,262,4.9772727272727275

1982281,5,B00019G42S,It is great . The children enjoy the bright color and the voices used is kid-friendly.  I would want children to realize the moral to these stories.,1370649600,,148,4.481481481481482
1982282,5,B00019G42S,"when we got the complete Beatrix Potter collection Vol. 2, of course we have to get the Nr. 1 too. To complied the whole stories. We really enjoy watching it! We love it!",1368057600,,170,4.181818181818182
1982283,3,B00019G42S,"Cartoons are very well done, no complaints there. I did not like that each episode has to be started individually. I would have really preferred being able to say play all",1358640000,,171,4.548387096774194
1982284,5,B00019G42S,"I was delightfully surprised to find that the art work and script for this movie stuck as closely as possible with Potter's original stories. Some of the stories can be difficult for young American children to follow (different vocabulary and lavish writing style) but this movie brought those stories to life for my boys. We won't watch it often, preferring to read the stories at bed time instead, but this is an excellent rainy day movie for us.",1250467200,6,448,4.756410256410256

8008696,5,B00019G42S,"My mother had this collection, both Volume 1 and Volume 2, when I was a child. It was one of my very favorite cartoons of all time. It's beautifully animated and it just perfect to get your imagination flowing. I've recently purchased this for my son as an Easter gift and I hope he enjoys it as much as I did.",1487894400,,310,4.098360655737705
8008697,5,B00019G42S,Incredibly sweet stories with beautiful watercolor animation that Beatrix Potter herself would have approved off. An excellent choice for quiet screen time that is not to stimulating. Love! The last one is a especially great depiction of her Christmas story...,1472083200,,260,5.525

8008700,5,B00019G42S,"This applies to both Volumes 1 and 2.  I actually first bought these videos almost 15 years ago -- as video tapes, and they bring back very fond memories of when my 17 year old daughter was a little girl.  They are beautifully made, faithful to the art and culture of the books, precious little movies.  I liked them as much as my daughter did and they one of the few things we watched on a screen.  I just bought this collection as well as the complete book of Beatrix Potters' stories for my little nephew -- and his mom.  I could have given them my boxed set of video tapes, but I had no intention of parting with them!",1453939200,2,622,4.15

8008703,5,B00019G42S,"This review applies to both volume 1 and volume 2 - all nine stories.  Few children will fail to enjoy these charming stories.  The expertly done animation brings the original Beatrix Potter illustrations to life. Truly it's almost as though she'd somehow done the animation herself.  This BBC production team has worked magic here.  Each of the nine stories is framed with beautifully done live-acted, dramatic scenes, depicting Miss Potter at her home and in the countryside surrounding her farmhouse in the Lake District (I'm quite sure it was filmed at the location, but not certain).  Her warmth and very spirited demeanor are readily conveyed by  the actress's relaxed and natural performance; the period decor and the furnishings, along with the early 20th century Lake District countryside settings, seem just to ""take one there"" - all of it, as convincing as the BBC always seems to be at ""period England"": you are _there_.

These scenes are extremely effective, as ""bookends"" to the animated stories, at ""guiding the viewer"" in to the world and mind of Beatrix Potter.  As the various stories' origins are dramatically depicted, with Miss Potter writing the stories in the form of letters to various children in her life; as she prepares, and occasionally mid-story, she talks aloud about precipitating events and the various characters within.  As the stories unfold, it is her voice, as Beatrix, doing the narratives, no doubt as written.  And of course each of the stories within the letters' pages include various of her brilliant illustrations (which are, again, clearly the templates for the animated characters on the DVD).

The animated stories themselves - I've already described how true to the original books' artwork the animation is.  Add to that what is perhaps the most compelling aspect of this collection, the voice-over actors' performances.  I certainly recognize the names, and have been told it's a veritable ""who's-who"" of British acting, but regardless - they do it very well.  It's hard to point one out that stands apart from the rest - each is extremely well done..  Of course, many folks will recognize the voice of Dr. House - that is Hugh Laurie - as the friendly and gregarious ""Johnny Town-mouse"";  so expressive and present (and no cutting remark or blatant put-downs, though I was almost expecting it ;-)  Mr. Laurie was in professional form that day.  ;-)

Before I wrap up, I've got to mention the soundtrack.  The accompanying music is phenomenal, simply ... yeah, phenomenal.  It is never too loud or overbearing as it sets the mood for each scene, each moment.  It is, in fact, almost soothing; relaxing.  That's not to say that it's lacking energy or ""sleepy"" - in fact it is vibrant and filled with energy; only it is a calm and assertive energy (to shamelessly borrow a phrase from Caesar, the Dog Whisperer ;-).  It seems to fit the story content perfectly, while producing a sort-of relaxed, enamored or captivated feeling - the kids will enjoy this greatly, and will not likely keep bouncing off the walls (if that's what they were doing - just a guess) but rather will likely settle down and really enjoy each of these stories.  At the same time, that relaxed feel will likely have the adults sitting down to enjoy them with the kids.

The marriage of this collection's incredible animation and overall production quality with such professionally voice-acted performances has resulted in a true children's classic (of a classic).  This collection, these videos, is the ""one of these.. not like the other ones""...  And that's a really GOOD thing, actually.",1424563200,5,3610,4.981636060100167
8008704,4,B00019G42S,"No problems with order or delivery. We love the DVD. 4 stars because there is a slight problem with
it opening some parts from the disc menu place.",1421107200,,147,4.285714285714286
