8497945,5,B006H0SVZ8,Great show with a Stunning leading lady. Only 8 episodes but all winners. Hoping there are more out there that will be released.,1433894400,,128,4.608695652173913
8497946,5,B006H0SVZ8,"This is a fun, entertaining, Canadian Cop show starring Amy Price-Francis as feisty, sexy, funny Detective Sargent King. Married to another Cop on the force we get glimpses of their home life/relationship where they are trying to have a kid while Det King takes over the Major Crimes Unit in the Dept. You'd hardly know this was a Canadian Cop show as it has all the good elements of American ones; car chases, gun-play; politics. I can't really compare it to another cop show, and yet its like all of them. It doesn't really bring anything 'new' to the many other cop shows out there, but its well done, has plenty of humor/action and Amy Price-Francis makes it addictive to watch.",1433635200,,682,4.644628099173554
8497947,5,B006H0SVZ8,This I purchased Used but came in spanking new condition (at least I can't tell it was used)-wonderful sound and image quality..and gripping drama. I love Jess's sassy one-liners! Really good show. Pity I have been looking to buy Season 2 for zone 1 and no joy yet! I am hooked!,1387411200,2,278,4.470588235294118
