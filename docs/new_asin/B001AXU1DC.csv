3473322,5,B001AXU1DC,"As one reviewer admitted his age, I'll do the same and say I am a 48 year-old father of two teenagers that genuinely believes this is some of the best entertainment on TV right now. Light-hearted and usually very funny humor, no nasty/vulgar language, no sexual innuendo, and disrespect for adults is generally limited to people that deserve it (Miss Briggs, Lewbert, Mr. Howard, etc.) as opposed to adults in general. There is usually a simple but valuable lesson involved and the interplay between the kids seems genuine and not forced in any way. The chemistry of the actors is a superb mix of personalities and each one brings a unique flavor to the show. The feisty interplay between Freddy and Sam with Carly attempting unsuccessfully to be arbitrator is a big part of the charm. Another positive factor is that no two episodes use the same rhetoric. Miranda Cosgrove is a very talented young lady and her future seems bright indeed. It will be interesting to see what season 2 brings. Hopefully they will be able to keep things fresh and moving forward. These episodes will provide a lifetime of valuable entertainment. Buy it!! You will not be disappointed.",1223683200,60,1165,4.83
3473323,5,B001AXU1DC,"Some people may think I'm too old to watch this show, but I highly disagree. I'm an 18-year old man, but I still feel like a child on the inside. iCarly is awesome! I love it! Everyone looks fun to hang out with. Carly and Sam are hot! Spencer seems like the perfect big brother, who is Carly's guardian. Freddie, Sam, and Carly start their own webshow where no adults can tell them what to do, throughout the series, they deal with what to do on the show, deal with Nevel who tries to destroy their show, try to make their grandpa see that Spencer is responsible enough to make care of Carly, go to a haunted apartment on HALLOWEEN, and much more! I know this won't last too long, so I'll enjoy it while I can! If you love comedy, you'll love ICARLY!!!",1222560000,4,753,4.236111111111111

3473537,2,B001AXU1DC,"This is a 'cute' show in the teenager genre and the kids liked it; however, several of the shows exhibit blatant disregard for any parental figures, including, but not limited to, Carly's older brother.  One episode had two of the characters using a mob of teenagers to attack a headmistress so that Carly didn't go to a different school.  Another episode had them disobey their parents and sneak off to an MMA match to do a show.  Not only were they found out (duh!!! you're broadcasting from there), but Carly's older brother was attacked by one of the MMA performers and then the kids, not worried about their 'parent', invited the MMA star to their home to finish the show.
Unfortunately like most of the shows in this genre, it teaches the kids that parents are overbearing and uncaring imbeciles that only get in the way of kids having fun.  There are occasional shows with decent messages, but they are generally hidden by the degenerate depictions of the 'stereotypical' adults in the show.",1476921600,,998,4.7514450867052025

They had the first couple of seasons on Prime and then you had to buy the rest which I thought was fair seeing as how the show is SUPER old. But come on...There is no way I'm paying 20-25 bucks each for six seasons of this show. I already bought Victorious even though they didn't give me credit for individual episodes already purchased which is really shady!. I'm not buying all of these too!
