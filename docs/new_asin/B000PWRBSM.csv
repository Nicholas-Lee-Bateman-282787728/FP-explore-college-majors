2828550,1,B000PWRBSM,"Its a horrible ripoff of ""Pixar Ratatouille."" Everything about this movie are horrible, the animation is terrible, the story is garbage and the voices are horrible. The plot in this movie is different from Pixar Ratatouille. Three mices owns a restaurant and there are a group of spy mices who wants to know what their formula for the food they make. No need for me to say more, because like I said, the story is garbage. The name Ratatoing is undeniably the worst movie name I have ever heard in my life. It shouldn't exist, so stay away from this movie. Get Pixar Ratatouille instead.",1267920000,7,586,4.59047619047619

2828552,1,B000PWRBSM,"I don't understand why this was one of the highest-rated movies of the year. What were the critics thinking? This is not up to Pixar and Brad Bird's standards, not by a long shot, but they have set the bar pretty high and I suppose their wave of success had to break eventually. Maybe it's because they lost their good-luck charm -- I was listening for John Ratzenberger and didn't hear him anywhere.

Don't worry, Pixar! I still have faith in you. Get up, dust yourself off, and make the next one great. Surely it will have to be better than this one.",1196899200,16,552,4.359223300970874
2828553,1,B000PWRBSM,"I work for an animation studio and someone brought this in.  We got about 20 minutes of great big laughs out of it. No, not because it was funny, but because it was literally the worst thing we had ever seen.  It's not even good for little little kids because nothing happens.  Reward talent and hard work, not ripoffs, please, and do not buy this EVER!",1189036800,37,353,4.318181818181818
2828554,1,B000PWRBSM,"I saw this at the DVD store today. I knew it was gonna be some RATATOUILLE rip-off (I haven't seen Ratatouille yet), and let me just say: Thank God I also rented AMERICAN HISTORY X. I watched it and I couldn't even make it all the way. Horrible Animation, even worse voice acting. The jokes are NOT for the intended audience, and After seeing the 20 minutes of this that I watched, I concluded that I need to see RATATOUILLE and not this junk.",1188000000,14,443,4.285714285714286

2828556,1,B000PWRBSM,"Ratatoing is an action-adventure stealth video game produced by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and released for the PlayStation in 1998. The game was directed, produced, and co-written by series creator Hideo Kojima, and serves as a sequel to the MSX2 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which Kojima also wrote and directed.
Metal Gear Solid follows Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit. Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike. Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting was used throughout the entire game.
Metal Gear Solid was well received, shipping more than six million copies, and scoring an average of 94/100 on the aggregate website Metacritic. It is regarded as one of the greatest and most important games of all time, and is often seen as the game which helped popularize the stealth genre. The commercial success of the title prompted the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and PC, titled Metal Gear Solid: Integral; and a remake, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes was later released for the GameCube. The game has also spawned numerous sequels, prequels and spin-offs, including several games, a radio drama, comics, and novels.",1508544000,4,1470,5.206751054852321

Watching this movie was the best 43 minutes of my life. The cat? Genius. This movie is so much better than Ratatouille, I can't even start to explain. I thought the graphics were of something of the next century! I can't think of one point in this movie that I was bored. An overall 100/10!

2828567,5,B000PWRBSM,"instant classic for the whole family. watched this with my three kids and my husband. My children had a blast and loved the cute animals and my husband loved the clever humor to match. We considered buying the Disney original ""Ratatouille"", but for the price and plot line, this is ten times better. I highly recommend this movie to watch snuggled next to the family, with a big bowl of popcorn in your lap, drinking a glass of white wine.",1483833600,,439,4.5

I've never seen Ratatouille but I have no doubt in my mind that it is way better than this turd.
Only watch this movie on youtube if you have a morbid curiosity for horrible animation and voice acting.
I only recommend watching this garbage with a drinking game accompanying it.
Do not take a drink every time you hear the word precisely you will probably be dead before the movie is over.",1477094400,,451,4.445783132530121

2828576,5,B000PWRBSM,"I love this movie!! My friend and I got into ironically watching Disney knockoffs last year, and none of them make me laugh as hard as Ratatoing. I'd recommend watching this with a friend so you have someone to share all the ""WTF?!?"" moments with. The animation is straight-up laughable at some moments, with characters bending their bodies in weird ways and an extended costume sequence that focuses on the characters making weird poses and awkward grunting noises. My favorite scene is definitely the ""villain celebration"" scene, where the four villains do a strange and unexplained dance while chanting and making awkward groans.

If you're looking to laugh your head off, I'd highly recommend this movie!!",1449878400,9,709,5.112068965517241

2828582,5,B000PWRBSM,"Wow...
This movie is quite impressive. For a budget of a potato they certainty did an excellent job. It has high grade animation, better than any pixar movie! The characters are griping, and they often change hairstyles and voices while staying the same. The protagonists bushy eyebrows are endearing, and the sexual way in which the pink mouse walks is stunning. I loved every moment of this movie. Well worth the purchase for the dance sequence and cat chase scenes alone.
Not only did this movie have adorable rats, it properly displayed cats as minions of Satan.
Over all with the budget it had (a potato) this studio proved it is a fine talent!",1356134400,21,649,4.701754385964913
2828583,5,B000PWRBSM,"I loved this movie!!! I always wanted to see what happened to remy after Ratatouille. Apparently he got some bad plastic surgery and was so ashamed that he had to change his name to Ratatoing??! Now he's a thief who makes (Sh**) that people love to eat. All he has to do is stir a pot all day! Did anyone else notice that surrounding the pot was black crap that look like mouse droppings? I thought that the sequel accually topped the first movie...All through Ratatouille I was thinking "" If only there was a weird dance number that had four mice dancing and acting high"". Love this movie!",1347494400,6,590,4.422018348623853
2828584,5,B000PWRBSM,"This is the perfect movie to give to a kid you don't like. The first 15 minutes consists of weird looking rats talking about how great the food is, while the chef stirs the same pot over and over. The characters move like they're walking thru water and the same animation is used over and over. Then they risk their life to steal a strawberry. Then other stuff happens with a group who wants the secret recipe (they use human food). A perfect gift for the ""slow learner"" in your life.",1326499200,40,484,4.329670329670329
2828585,1,B000PWRBSM,"The things you discover on the internet. Apparently theres a Brazillian company that ""speciallizes"" in seeing the latest popular kids movies and then using whatever cheep ass technology they have to rip them off. This ""movie"" is about a rat in what looks like Paris who runs a restraraunt and loves to cook. Hmmmm....Sounds like another movie. Sounds like one of my favorite Disney movies Ratouille! I guess their hoping someones grandma will come in wanting to buy their grandchild Ratatouille but instead see Ratatoing and bring it home instead. One night I was bored and just decided to look up the worst movies ever and this came up. The first thing that I noticed was the voice acting. Alot of the voice actors in this movie did work for 4kids entertainment, most notably Dan Green who voices one of the poorly 3d rendered mouse. I guess the actors wanted a quick buck. The original dub is better by only a hair, because the voices are a little less annoying. Plus during a pointless dance scene the original version has the rats silent while the dub has the rats letting out jarring grunting noises. The whole movie looks like a poorly made computer game. I know alot of people have said it, but Disney should sue their asses off. if you're curious, but don't want to suffer through the whole movie just look up Youtube poops. They'll make it less painful. If you're a masochist for bad movies like me, once again Youtube is the place to go.",1283904000,5,1447,4.612403100775194

8193627,5,B000PWRBSM,"When considering contemporary art forms featuring religion, philosophy, and perspective, Ratatoing is the apex of cinematic entertainment. With a bold outlook on the impact of Christ, Ratatoing tackles the millennia-old inquiry; from whence does man come? Ratatoing follows the spiritual journey of Jesus Christ, the enlightenment of a simple carpenter, and offers an array of perspectives, condoning nor condemning the sometimes reprehensible, sometimes responsible endeavors of the figure that many worship, that thousands despise. Ratatoing is an enthralling, enduring classic that illustrates with clarity the nature of the spirit Christ embodied.",1513814400,8,651,6.164835164835165
