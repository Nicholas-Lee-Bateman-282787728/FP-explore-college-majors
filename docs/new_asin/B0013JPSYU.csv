8251348,5,B0013JPSYU,This is a wonderful version.  I own the Franco Zeffirelli version with Domingo and Stratas and wanted to add this one to my collection.  This is very good and you get a behind the scenes how it was produced.  Zubin Mehta is the conductor and you cannot say enough about his work on this film. I highly recommend this DVD if you like La Traviata.,1290297600,2,345,4.276923076923077

8251350,5,B0013JPSYU,"I have seen serveral versions of La Traviata as well on DVD as in the operahouse. From all these versions this is the one I like best. Is it made as a movie (filmed within 24 hours and broadcasted live!) on locations where the story could have happened. Both protagonists Jose Cura and Eteri Gvazava look there role well and act natural. Eteri Gvazava looses an earring by accident you think. She acts ashamed, but no, it its part of the play. The both ballets (gypsy girls and matadores) are really stunning. The last scene where Violetta is dieing is a real anguished sickroom. As Violetta dies Germont holds her in his arms. It is touching.
Look no further, see this one!",1244851200,3,674,4.532786885245901
