678879,5,6303562248,"Anastasia is the heart warming tale of Anastasia Nicholaievna, Daughter of Tzar Nicholas II, The last Tzar Of Russia. Though not Historicaly correct, Anastasia shows the pains and tormoils that 'Anna Anderson' wen't to to  prove herself the last surviving member of the Romanov Imperial Family. A  tear jerking Performance By Bergman keeps this compelling drama alive, and  although the is she/isn't she question is never answered, it doesnt effect  the plot at all. I would Also recomend 'Anastasia-The Mystery of Anna' with  Amy Irving-A Historicaly correct Mini-series. Watch this film, and you will  spiral into the wonderfuly surreal world that is 'ANASTASIA' a Classic!",951868800,3,675,5.380952380952381

678881,4,6303562248,"Ingrid Bergman (always highly magnetic) gives a haunting performance that must be considered one of the greatest in film history. Despite the  commanding presence of Yul Brynner, she dwarfs him, and really everyone  else in the film, excepting Helen Hays (who is also superb). Director  Anatole Litvak's handling may be quaintly theatrical, and be a bit elegant  for today's viewers; but the performances, dialogue, and ever tantalizing  mystery (is she, or isn't she?) clutch the attention throughout. While this  film may throw little light on history, it draws in its characters  expertly, entertains solidly, and the choreography of individual scenes  (particularly those between Bergman and Hays) is positively electric. A  highly enjoyable and satisfying film!",918432000,2,766,5.591304347826087

I saw this movie when I was 9 years old and instantly became obcessed with the story of Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess Anastasia, even more so when I found out it was based off a true story.  This movie has made me laugh, made me cry, and just enjoyment when watching it.  You cannot fault Ingrid Bergman in this movie.  I believe this is her first movie she made after having her child.

Miss Bergman played the role of Anastasia Romanov, and she must convince the Dowager Empress (Miss Hayes) Marie Feodorovna that she is her granddaughter, Her Imperial Highness The Grand Duchess Anastasia who was to have escaped the brutal murder of the Romanov family.  She claims she was only stunned and one of the guardsmen helped her to safety.  Her MA-MA, the Empress Alexandra was to have sewn jewels in the hem of the Romanov girls' dresses.  This is what she lived on until she was hospitalized.  Most of the Russian Imperial Family fled to France before and after the capture of the Czar and the Imperial Family.  The Dowager Empress Marie fled to Denmark, because her brother was the King of Denmark.

679368,4,6303562248,"Ingrid Bergman returns to the silver screen 6 years after being exiled from Hollywood because the married star was having an affair with director Roberto Rossellini - `o the horror - only to win an Oscar.  She plays Anna Koreff (one of many names), a homeless woman having been jettisoned from a mental institution.

Gen. Sergei Pavlovich Bounine (Yul Brynner in one of his best performances) brings her into his less than open arms.  It seem the general has been looking for a suitable stand-in for Anastasia, the daughter of the 10 years departed Czar of Russia, who along with his family was brutally gunned down by the Bolshevik regime.  Rumors were that the 17 year old Anastasia had somehow survived and escaped to Romania.

Anatole Litvak and his writers play loose with historical facts but who cares.  The key is to get Anna to believe she is the duchess and she drifts in and out of reality enough to make us believe maybe she actually is.  Sergei is only interested in the $10 million dowry that is in escrow awaiting Anastasia once she is authenticated by her closest living relative, Empress Maria Feodorovna (Helen Hayes, chewing up the scenes), Anastasia's grandmother.

The Empress has quite a spread herself in Copenhagen, Denmark.  When Anna, Sergei and his 2 associates finally get a meet-and-greet with the Empress, the outcome is eventually fulfilling.  It would seem Anastasia has too many quirks and inside knowledge that she must be the missing heir.  The film has massive sets, beautiful color and is grand filmmaking in all aspects.

The disc includes a documentary from the ""Biography"" TV show about Anastasia and the woman who many believed was, in fact, the duchess.  I will also mention that I had no sound issues with this disc as noted by other reviewers.",1407542400,3,1787,4.838815789473684

Ingrid, why don't you come to Hollywood to show to those amateurs/models/singers with no talent/one night starlets/rich empty celebrities what the true art is.  We really long for your class of art.  I bought this movie to see Ingrid's performance.  Yes, video-tape has the best picture quality.

679454,5,6303562248,"I have always been interested about what happened to the ruling family in Russia during the Revolution. There has always been rumors that some of the family survived the execution that took place.
Many rumors that the Czar's daughter Anastasia & her brother survived circulated for a number of years. There have been many books & movies about this subject, but I have thought that this version was one of the best.
The movie starred some of the top names such as Ingrid Bergman, Yul Brynner, and Helen Hayes.
It was rumored that a woman was found who had been injured & had some memory loss. This injured person could not remember her name, so the medical staff called Anna Anderson. While under treatment it was said that she would tell about her family being held prisoner & being taken to a lower level of where they were being held & being shot. Anastasia had some health issues that only immediate family knew about. Rumors started circulating that Anna Anderson was the Czar's daughter Anastasia. This movie showed what possibly happen to this person who knew certain information that only living family members could know. I recommend this movie for people to watch & form your own opinion if Anna Anderson was Anastasia.

679509,5,6303562248,"Growing up, my mother's favorite actor was Yul Brynner.  Because of that, two of the films we watched repeatedly in our house were `The King and I' and `Anastasia', `Anastasia' being her favorite.  Because of that, I grew to completely adore a different actor, or should I say actress; Ingrid Bergman.  Yes, I consider Bergman to be one of the greatest actresses to ever work in film, and her legacy will be forever remembered.  This three time Oscar winner won her second Oscar for this haunted and truly articulated performance.  She stuns with each frame and completely takes on this woman who is a woman within a woman with such nuanced balance.

The story told is one of the long thought to be survivor of the Bolsheviks' attack on the czars family, Anastasia.  Bergman plays a young woman named Anna Koreff, suffering from amnesia and convinced by a General that she is the long lost Anastasia and used by him to con the Grand Duchess, Anastasia's grandmother.

The film is set up like an open-ended fairytale, with the actualities of the `con' being left up for the audience to decide.  Was she the real Anastasia?  Well, recent discoveries have taught us that she was not, for the real Anastasia did in fact die and it was her sister, Marie, who was actually missing (and later found), but this reality does not deter from the film's impact and the air of mystery and beautiful doubt that it provides the viewer.  Taken as a fictional retelling of a true story, this mesmerizing film is not only expertly acted (Brynner is possibly better here than in his Oscar winning role that same year) but is perfectly paced and poised so as to draw us in and never let us go.",1377820800,,1673,4.5993265993265995

679584,3,6303562248,"First of all, it has recently been determined by DNA analysis that the woman about whom this movie was made was NOT the Grand Duchess Anastasia. But because this movie was made in 1956, it gives a convincing impression that she was. Since this is a fictionalized story anyway, it should not matter.

Yul Brynner plays General Bounine to perfection. Ingrid Bergman is convincing as the woman the General chooses to portray Anastasia, in part because when she was in a mental hospital in Berlin, she told the nun who took care of her that she was Anastasia. But she also resembles the photographs of the Grand Duchess, and the outline Bounine's co-conspirators made of her figure based on the reports of her dressmaker. Bounine does not believe she is, but he believes he can convince the people who need to be convinced so that she can inherit the money the Czar had on deposit in London at the time of his death.

Helen Hayes plays the dowager Empress (that is, Czar Nicholas' mother), now in exile in Copenhagen. She does not want to see any more pretenders because her heart has been broken too many times. Finally, she agrees to see Anastasia, and becomes convinced she is real.

There's more, especially involving the prince to whom Anastasia was engaged to be married at the time of the revolution. There are balls with beautiful costumes and sets, there is the charming Russian restaurant General Bounine runs, and there is the undeniable sex appeal of Yul Brenner. Nevertheless, this movie fails to satisfy. It's pleasant enough on the whole, but I realize that most of my pleasure in it centers on Yul Brenner. The story itself rather bored me, and I found the character played by Ingrid Bergman too confusing because, as I said, we now know that the woman was not in fact Anastasia, but the movie requires that we presume she is.",1337126400,,1838,4.684210526315789
679642,5,6303562248,"Paris, in the frenzied 1920s, when an opportunistic con man - who happens to be an expatriate Russian General - is struck by a beggar woman's uncanny resemblance to the long-lost Russian princess Anastasia, them wheels, they start the spinnin'. When interrogated, the beggar woman (Ingrid Bergman) begs amnesia, but is she telling the truth or does she harbor an ulterior motive? Whatever, General Bounine (Yul Brynner) isn't about to pass up the chance to lay hands on the ten million pounds that the last surviving daughter of Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia would inherit. Except, in the wake of the revolution, didn't the entire Romanov royal family get executed some ten years before? But rumors whisper of Anastasia's survival.

If you relish PYGMALION and MY FAIR LADY but your temperament has you yearning for more gloom and doom melancholia, then 1956's ANASTASIA caters to your whims. ANASTASIA dabbles in historial speculation and royal deception, but who's to say the film didn't get it right? Did you not hear that quote, Horatio? In this reality, the devious General toils long and hard to groom the beggar woman, this skittish amnesiac refugee who suffers from alarming dementia. Still, Bounine, his eyes on the prize, is persistent. He instructs her in courtly decorum. He coaches her in the personal history of this youngest Romanov daughter, Her Imperial Highness, the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicolai. And since our hoaxtress is being played by the luminous Ingrid Bergman, is it too surprising that the General, even with his calculating heart, gradually falls in love with her?

Helen Hayes is in the film only long enough for a cup of coffee, it seems like. But, as the stern and formidable Dowager Empress, she dominates the screen. This icy figure serves as the ultimate gauntlet thru which all the would-be Anastasias must safely navigate. Hayes is simply wonderful and so effective; one moment, chillingly imperious; the next, so achingly frail. At first she rails against General Bounine's overtures: ""I will not see your client,"" she declares. ""I am as weary of these spectral grand-children as I am of false hope."" But Bounine is not without his baldy charms. His Anastasia gains an audience.

ANASTASIA was a personal triumph for Ingrid Bergman, and a classy eff you to her detractors. Having been blacklisted for her abandonment of husband Petter Lindstrom and their daughter Pia and for her affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini, Bergman's return to Hollywood is capped off by her garnering the Oscar for Best Actress for this picture. As the tormented ""Anastasia,"" Bergman is impeccable. She demonstrates a wounded vulnerability. Anastasia constantly drowns in a sea of palpable frustration and suppressed memories; Bergman's skills readily allow us this impression. Thanks to Bounine's unflagging ministrations, the beggar woman's damaged psyche permits her to gradually entertain the notion that, just maybe, she truly is the long missing princess.

Even more than her well-staged interactions with the elegant Yul Brenner, it's her moments with Helen Hayes that had me truly riveted. Their shared scenes near the end of the film, fraught with emotion and high tension and sheer displays of powerhouse acting, provide the narrative's payoff. ANASTASIA maintains a measured, somber approach. It certainly isn't as blithe as its animated descendant (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anastasia/dp/B000CNE092/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anastasia</a>, which featured Meg Ryan). But the bombast and pageantry are present. This is a period piece done up to scale. The love story is affecting, more so because of how understated it's played out. Does this ""Anastasia"" convince the fiercely skeptical Dowager Empress? And what of that unspoken something between her and the General? For Anastasia, will it be the quiet romance or the grand spectacle? Either way, the film leaves you in a reflective mood, and perhaps nursing pangs of regret and wistfulness. There may even be a bittersweet twinge in there somewhere, and a pining for something now long vanished. But, probably, I'm just projecting... It's unseemly for a manly man like me to sigh.",1333756800,2,4225,5.348872180451128
679643,1,6303562248,"One of my favorite films has always been ""Anastasia"", but I had never owned it. Imagine my thrill when the DVD arrived from Amazon. I opened it, put in the disc, sat down to enjoy a classic, and found:  1) the movie is in Wide Screen, which I HATE, and 2) the sound is soooooo low as to not be heard at all. I am not kidding. I turned up the volume on my television to its maximum level, was wearing my hearing aid, but I still could not hear it. Shame on whoever ruined such a fine film. Now imagine, if you can, my complete disgust and sadness, because of instead of being able to enjoy one of my favorite movies, I now have to try to find the movie in pan and scan or buy it in VHS format. What is wrong with studios and those who make such decisions about the ""viewability"" of a movie on the television screen? Most tv screens are not the size of a theatre screen, so the letterbox/widescreen format is ridiculous to use. It takes up a good third of the tv screen with two black bars, one at the top and another at the bottom. Why do film companies think that all customers want wide screen? I absolutely do not, and most times I'm forced to buy a VHS cassette tape to avoid having the letterbox/widescreen format. This DVD version of ""Anastasia"" is definitely going back to Amazon, and I strongly suggest, unless you don't care if you can hear any of the dialog, and don't mind seeing only a third of your tv screen in ""movie format"", that you do not buy this DVD. And if Amazon has any ""clout"" with film makers, I hope it listens to complaints like mine and exerts some leverage so that such stupidity stops.",1332201600,2,1614,4.2064516129032254
679644,5,6303562248,"After an abscence from the screen for half a decade, Ingrid Bergman made her Oscar winning return to the big screen in this sumptuous 1956 feature based on a play by Marcelle Maurette,written for the screen by Arthur Laurents, adapted by Guy Bolton, and directed by Anatole Litvak.
  The story is introduced with haunting and exotic sounding title song by Alfred Newman, which with exquisite lyrics later added by Maurice Newman and Paul Francis Webster, later became a popular song of the era.
  Based on the story of the many women claiming to be the youngest daughter of the executed Czar Nicholas II, Bergman dazzles as Anna Koreff, a haunted and waifish young woman, who, ten years after the Romanovs' execution, is seen leaving the Russian Orthodox Easter service at a cathedral in Paris,the home of many Russians driven into exile by the revolution, and heading for a bridge off of which to jump.
  She is followed by another man who had attended the service, General Sergei Pavlovich Bounine(Native Sakhalin islander, and consequently partly Russian Yul Brynner), who verbally identifies hers as the Czar's youngest daughter. She denies this claim as she flees towards the bridge. But before she can jump, Bounin and his conspirators, Chernov, and Petrovin(Akin Tamiroff and Sacha Pitoeff) restrain her and abduct her.
  Taken to Bounin's residence, the amnesiac is shown memorabilia of the Imperial family, and with a half-mad laugh and a cry, acknowledges being Anastasia.
  Bounin spends his days and nights grooming Anna to behave like a Grand Duchess, in the hope of being able to convince the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna( Helen Hayes)that he has restored her granddaughter to her, and claim reward money.
  But he is one of many conspirators who have made such an attempt and the weary and skeptical Dowager Empress is reluctant to see any more imposters, although Anna has begun to recall certain details of Imperial family life that Bounin and the others did not mention to her. Both Brynner and Bergman play their roles with admirable continental flair and sophistication.
  Through the scope of lavish costumes and elegant settings, and with the supporting talents of Martita Hunt as Baroness Elena von Livenbaum, Natalie Schafer as Irinia Lissemskaia, Gregoire Gromoff as Stepan, Karel Stepanek as Mikhail Vlados, Ina De La Haye as Marusia, Katherine Kath as Maxime,  Maroussia Dimitrevitch as a Gypsy singer, and Ivan Desny as Prince Paul von Haraldberg,a potential love interest for Anna, viewers are drawn in to trying to unravel the mystery presented to the world in the decades before the truth was established,but  feeling compelled to obey the Dowager Empresses' final words at the end: ""The play is over!

679647,5,6303562248,"Swapping what was one of the most horrifying political crimes of the Twentieth Century with a fluffy fairytale concoction, 1956's ANASTASIA resurrected Ingrid Bergman's screen career, netted her an Academy Award; and, most importantly, finally silenced the backlash she endured after running away from her young family to marry Roberto Rossellini.

Rescued from trying to throw herself into the River Seine, Anna Koreff (Ingrid Bergman), a destitute young escapee from an asylum, becomes the pawn in a scheme by a group of White Russian emigrees to impersonate the Grand Duchess Anastasia, presumed murdered along with the rest of her family during the Russian Revolution in 1918.  Capturing the imagination of sentimental loyalists in Paris, Anna and her mentor, General Bounine (Yul Brynner) travel on to Copenhagen in a bid to seal the deal - the acceptance of Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress (Helen Hayes).  But the Empress has grown weary of the game.  She's seen several pretenders and cannot endure another heartbreak.  Still, Bounine persists, until the fateful afternoon when Anna and the Empress finally come face-to-face...

ANASTASIA, originally presented on the Broadway stage by Guy Bolton (translated from an earlier Paris hit penned by Marcelle Maurette) is partly based on truth.  In 1920, a confused young woman was rescued from an attempted suicide and placed in a mental asylum.  She refused to offer her name to the authorities, but rumours started swirling that she was a member of the Russian royal family, who had been assassinated in 1918.  Anna Anderson, whom she would later call herself, spent the rest of her life campaiging for the recognition that she was, in fact, Grand Duchess Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the Tsar.  Court cases continued for years, but in the end, the fact of Anastasia's death (and therefore Anna Anderson's identity) could not be proved or disproved.  The bones of the royal family were finally unearthed several years after Anderson's death, and DNA from Anderson tested against it closed the case once and for all, when scientists announced that Anderson didn't share a common bloodline with the Imperial family.

By swapping the ghastly truth for a romantic fantasy, ANASTASIA's screenwriter Arthur Laurents fulfils the audiences' need for a happy ending.  Whilst Anna Anderson never found comfort in the outstretched arms of her beloved grandmother, Bergman's Anna does ultimately find her true birthright.  Audiences have always held a certain fascination for this story - part of the appeal in this 1956 version especially is the ""Pygmalion"" slant of the plot.  Anna is groomed, Eliza Doolittle-style, into becoming the lost princess, but in the end, the edges blur so bewitchingly that we cannot tell where Anna ends and Anastasia begins - or more pointedly, whether the girl really is Anastasia or not.

The gallery of supporting players is simply delicious, my favourite being the estimable Martita Hunt as the Baroness von Livenbaum, the Empress' giddy lady-in-waiting (""Oh, this is madness without the moon!"").  Akim Tamiroff plays another of the White Russian con artists.  Natalie (Lovey Howell) Schafer is a hammy Parisian emigree.

The DVD includes the highly-recommended A&E Biography on the real Anastasia, countless newsreels with Ingrid Bergman hitting the publicity trail for the film; plus an excellent audio commentary hosted by Sylvia Stoddard.

Shortly after, rumors started that the youngest daughter of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna had not been murdered with the rest of her family but had escaped and was still alive...

Bearing a strong resemblance to the Grand Duchess, the plan of the Russian group can succeed... There is an opportunity for them to share the inheritance, the fortune left by the Emperor...

After days of training, the unknown lady becomes another woman... Elegant, radiant and healthy, arousing profound solemnity, dignity and even royalty...

Helen Hayes is simply superb as the melancholic old Empress with a wistful desire to accept the vague truth...

Yul Brynner plays his role with enormous task...

The motion picture marks Ingrid Bergman's comeback to the Hollywood cinema after the European exile... She gives a gracious, confused, eloquent, moving performance, following back the progress of a woman, from the deepness of hopelessness and confusion, through strenuous efforts with uncertainty and disillusion, to a successful display of bravery, self-respect and love...

Directed with elegance by Anatole Litvak, and with a fascinating music score by Alfred Newman, ""Anastasia"" is a combination of mystery and romance, a compelling drama with quite considerable charm which persuade without projecting any flame on history...",1166313600,14,2717,5.15

Sad, because the movie was digitally restored and looks beautiful, otherwise.  In the beginning of the film, the background noise is loud and the dialogue is almost inaudible.  This persists for about the first 35 minutes of the film after which the two tracks seem to balance out more . . . althought I still had to keep the volumn up louder than normal, the rest of the film.  When I saw this film on VHS a few years ago, this was not the case so I know it had to do with the ""burning"" onto DVD.  Anyway, that is the only reason for three stars.  The movie, itself, is a masterpiece.  Restored to beautiful color and clarity, and in wide-screen, you almost feel as if you are seeing it on the silver screen for the first time in all its artistic grandeur.  Helen Hayes and Ingrid Bergman give stellar performances worthy of the oscars received.  Since the price is only about 8 bucks, I would so go ahead and get it, but keep the subtitles on for the first 30 minutes so you don't miss any of the dialogue.",1155600000,10,1133,4.252336448598131
679771,3,6303562248,"Anatole Litvak's 1956 Anastasia was Ingrid Bergman's big comeback vehicle after being cast into the moral void for running off with Roberto Rossellini, but it's Helen Hayes' performance that really gives the film its heart and its best scenes. Now that the story of Anna Anderson's claim to the title and inheritance of Tsar Nicholas' daughter has been completely debunked by DNA tests it's more a bit of wish-fulfilment than a compelling mystery, and one that doesn't go out of its way to disguise its theatrical origins - despite the lavish CinemaScope lensing, it rarely strays outdoors unless it's absolutely necessary for a brief establishing shot. Yul Brynner and Akim Tamiroff do their party pieces (stern precision and comically nervous dishonesty) and Bergman fares much better doing imperious than impoverished in a classy production that goes down smoothly but doesn't linger long in the memory.

Fox's R1 DVD suffers from an atrocious remix in the opening reel where the music and effects track are amplified while the dialog is reduced to a barely audible whisper even at full volume, a problem that doesn't affect the rest of the film but is irritating as hell while it lasts.",1151539200,3,1190,5.040609137055838
679772,5,6303562248,"Has Ingrid Bergman actually topped her performance in Casablanca or is she so great that every role she portrays is classic? Perhaps it's the excellent digital color re-mastering that illuminates Anastasia among prior theatrical presentations. Or it could be the moments of humor and romantic chemistry evident in the perfect pairing with Yul Brynner as a financially motivated con artist who plucks ""Anastasia"" from the brink of despair and trains her how to assume the royal throne. Maybe it is due to the fact that the story is based on non-fictional events and throughout the film, the viewer nor characters are quite certain of whether there is actually any deception taking place.

Everyone will certainly be drawn to Bergman as she once again delivers a profusion of drama through unrivaled facial expressions. Brynner would make an eloquent King and Berman is a true princess, regardless of the picture's outcome (but that's another movie). DVD extras include a detailed documentary about the real Anastasia.

679773,5,6303562248,"Anastasia had a tight plot, gripping dialogues and a brilliant portrayal by Ingrid Bergman. When Anastasia (Ingrid Bergman) was first confronted in the cellar, she denied to be the grand duchess while her words and fragmented memories more than once betrayed her past. Most intriguing was that she herself did not know who she was, after futile efforts to convince others she was the princess in the past 10 years. She could not differentiate what she actually remembered from what she was told to remember in the 8-day crash course of training.

The most touching scenes were how Anastasia responded to the successive examinations of board members, followed by of Russian aristocrats and finally by the Emperess, her grand ma ma (Helen Hayes). Ingrid Bergman succeeded in playing a confused Anastasia whose sudden bursts of personal experiences buried deep in her heart would convince the skeptics at the critical moment.

To cap it all, the flawless performance of the two actresses had made the emotional grandma-grandaughter reunion scene heartbreaking. The closeness between Yul Brynner and Ingrid Bergman was perfect and subtle as it should be. The romance was not so much said as it was felt - a simple kiss on the hand. Ingrid Bergman was the princess in the bones, she was diffident yet stately, long suffering yet proud. While Anastasia was eager to please her long lost grandma, her grandma loved her so much that she would let her free and grant her the happiness she long deserved - a fairy tale ending.",1143244800,4,1516,4.9411764705882355

In order to claim 10 million ruples in the duchess's name, they devise a scheme to coach her and then pass her off as the real item. Yul Brynner is the leader of this operation, but as he coaches her in the ways of the real duchess, it becomes clear to Bergman that she IS the real duchess. But who will believe her? Bergman is excellent as Anastasia, winning the Acadamy Award for her role. Also excellent is Helen Hayes as the Empress.

I only wished the ending scene would be between Brynner and Bergman or maybe it's just the romantic in me who wanted to see one last glimpse of those two together!  Brynner is so handsome in this movie and Bergman is an absolutely wonderful actress.  Brynner was an excellent choice for the Russian General.  You even get a chance to hear his amazing voice when he sings with the gypsies, and you see him dance and play the guitar.  Just for those moments, I would have purchased this DVD.  Brynner's character evolves beautifully in this movie.  Even if he seems only interested in money in the beginning, we can see the change in him and his conversation with Helen Hays is so moving it bring tears to my eyes.  Bergman was also great in this movie, just as the supporting cast (who can forget the Baroness Livenbaum!).  Oh after seeing this movie I want to see all of Yul Brynner's movies.

679836,4,6303562248,"""Anastasia,"" with its Oscar winning performance by Ingrid Bergman, and lavish, meticulous direction by Anatole Litvak, is a wonder to look at, but is ruined in this DVD release by an abysmal sound transfer. It is so poor, that the only way to watch it is with subtitles. The film is loosely based on the true story of eccentric amnesiac Anna Anderson, and the play by Marcelle Maurette, and it recounts in mythical fashion how this royal pretender was thought by some to be the survivor of the massacre of the Romanov family by the Soviets in 1918.

The story begins in 1928, with General Sergei Bounine, who escaped the Russian revolution and opened a restaurant in Paris. He finds Anna, and transforms her into the princess, rather in the manner of Henry and Eliza in ""Pygmalion,"" in order to convince the Romanov family scattered throughout Europe that Anna is their long lost beloved Anastasia, and consequently to inherit the money left in the Bank of England.

Yul Brynner is brilliant as Bounine, a part that gives his swaggering screen presence and natural elegance full range to shine. Brynner was also to receive an Oscar in 1956, not for this film, but for ""The King and I."" Also marvelous is Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress Maria, who in a moving scene is brought to believe that Anna is truly Anastasia. Others of note in the cast include Akim Tamiroff and Martita Hunt. The Alfred Newman score has a theme that stays with you days after viewing the film, and the cinematography by Jack Hildyard is a visual treat.

The DVD extras are excellent, and include commentary by film historian Sylvia Stoddard, Arthur Laurents, who wrote the screenplay, Helen Hayes' son, actor James MacArthur, and writer Jon Burlingame. Most interesting is the A&E Biography of Anna and Anastasia, with remarkable archival footage. The DVD should be re-released with improved sound, because it is unacceptable as is, and it is a pity such a lovely film has been marred by an unintelligible voice track (which incidentally, sounds fine in the portions with the commentary that one can hear).",1126742400,3,2084,4.831932773109243

679839,5,6303562248,"I've been fascinated with the story of the Romanovs since grade nine, when I did a project on Anastasia.  Having read almost all the books on the subject of Anna Anderson (who passed herself off  -- or rather, was passed off -- as the princess Anastasia from the late 1920s till her death in the early 1980s), I'm still of two minds as to whether she really was who she claimed.  That being said, it's always nice to believe in fairy tales, and Fox's 1956 version of the story definitely leans toward to romantic rather than the cynical version of events.

Ingrid Bergman, one of my favorite actresses of all time, won a much-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of the mystery woman whom con artist Yul Brynner picks up off the streets and trains to pass as Anastasia before her grandmother, the Grand Duchess (Helen Hayes).  It's a tour-de-force performance that is as subtle as ever won an Oscar.  Watch her face during the scene in which she realizes she's being used by Brynner to get money.  It's a mixture of betrayal, hurt, anger, and relief (she's falling for him too, and scared of it).

Fox's presentation of ANASTASIA, the 9th in its hopefully long-running series of Studio Classics, is a grand presentation in the original 2.35:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio.  The colors jump off the screen at you, and I finally understood how it was meant to be seen, after years of knowing only the cropped home video version.  There's an audio commentary by Alfred Newman biographer John Burlingame, screewriter Arthur Laurents, and actor James MacArthur (the son of Helen Hayes), who relate trivia about the score, the film, and Hayes' experiences making the movie, respectively.  Joining them on the commentary is historian Sylvia Stoddard who gives us some background on the film, but focuses mainly on the reality of the Anastasia/Anna Anderson saga.  Stoddard also contributes an audio essay about the Romanovs.

There's an A&E biography special on Anastasia, a few newsreels (some from 1956, others from 1917!), and the requisite trailer and restoration featurette.  All in all, a wonderful presentation of an exceptional movie.

I especially liked it because they had an interview with Hellen Hayes (The Grandmother) son James MacArthur. I have been corresponding with him and i just really liked that.
Here Is A brief Description:
Anastasie (Ingird Bergman) is a woman who has no clue about who she is and where she comes from, she then meets (Yul Brynner) who thinks that if he can train her to act like the Real Annastasia he can pass her off and get the huge reward for her return. Well when they get to St. petersburg they find out that The Arch Duchess (Hellen Hayes) has lost hope of ever finding her Annastasia and refuses to see Ingrid Bergman. Well she finally visits Ingrid Bergman and realizes that she really is her grand daughter. And it ends happily.
Great Movie. 5 Star Rating.",1062460800,2,915,4.3882352941176475
679843,3,6303562248,"Let me start off by saying that I find Ingrid Bergman a goddess among actresses, and Yul Brynner is always interesting to watch. But I discovered to my surprise (and disappointment) that Bergman and Brynner had very little chemistry...I have always found the story of Anastasia to be extremely fascinating, and this production was fine in many details, but when all was said and done, ""Anastasia"" was remarkably overdone and underwhelming because of some very shallow writing and the miscasting of the two stars.
Helen Hayes easily stole the movie as Anastasia's grandmother. She had the best lines.
A critical scene: When Anastasia appeals to her grandmother to open her eyes to the truth, the words seem artificial. I saw the grandmother, an elderly woman who has lost everything, as the victim and never Anastasia. There is no doubt that Bergman poored her heart into the scene, but her words rang false every time she tried to convince Hayes she was her niece. And even after Anastasia's acceptance by her grandmother, the ending seems artificial and rushed, as if the director ran out of patience and yelled 'cut' prematurely.
Brynner always seems to be more interested in himself than Anastasia or his friends. And when he DOES finally show a little compassion when he asks for a meeting with Hayes near the end, it is too little too late because we still don't see what Anastasia would see in this selfish man who has not once been nice to her in the whole time he has known her (maybe he was nice to her at one point, but that ended up on the cutting room floor).
And we are to believe that the grandmother is okay with this? That Anastasia loves him? That this man and Anastasia will live happily ever after? Wrong.
Some of you might be suggesting right about now that I should get a life, that ""Anastasia"" is a classic. It's true. It is a classic. And Bergman never looked more beautiful, and Brynner more dashing.
A bigger annoyance was the DVD's poor restoration. The audio quality is clearly out of synch with the rest of the movie. A better effort should have been done by all.",1060560000,3,2091,4.654054054054054

679895,4,6303562248,"The 1956 version of ?Anastasia? is the rapturous fairytale that attempts to answer the question surrounding the mystery of what became of the youngest daughter belonging to Tsar Nicholas II, the last Imperial ruler of Russia. Arthur Lawrence happily distances his screenplay from anything even remotely associated with the tragic historical record to focus instead on a troupe of militant loyalist exiles wallowing in their pasts in Paris.  Ingrid Bergman stars as the mysterious woman with no past who is plucked from obscurity by con man, General Bounine (Yul Brynner). Bounine wants to get his hands on Anastasia?s ten million dollar inheritance. Engaging two former masters from Russia?s imperial court, the conniving Chernov (Akim Tamaroff) and the nervous Petrovan (Sasha Pitoeff) Bounine begins to educate his find in a crash course of social graces and royal protocol. However, somewhere between the lesson and the past, the prot?g? begins to recall places and people that she hasn?t been taught about, leaving Bounine with more curiosity and questions than ever before. Can it be that the woman with no past is in fact the actual heir to the Russian throne?  Helen Hayes costars as the impeccable Dowager Empress. Her initial reaction to Bounine is one of bitter disdain. But when the woman being groomed as Anastasia suddenly recalls for the Empress a memory that no one but she could have known, the Dowager?s heart melts and she accepts the woman as her grand daughter. As a mere supporting player, Martita Hunt, as the Baroness Von Livenbaum, is a genuine scene stealer. This is a film of immense emotional undercurrents made all the more poignant by a stellar cast of performers.
Fox DVD has done a very nice job remastering this film for DVD. Previous editions on laserdisc and VHS had been plagued by orangy flesh tones and excessive amounts of film grain. This DVD corrects and properly balances the colors. Though at times flesh tones can appear a little on the pasty side, over all the color, black levels and fine detail are impeccably rendered. A slight amount of edge enhancement and some very minute aliasing crops up in a few scenes but nothing that will distract. The audio is a 4.0 remastering effort that brings back the early grandeur of Cinemascope stereophonic recording to its original glory.
Extras include a Biography Special on the real Anastasia, a Movie-tones trailer, a restoration comparison and the film's original theatrical trailer - plus an insightful audio commentary running throughout the film's presentation.
This is a handsomely mounted production that really lives up to its subject matter. What became of the real Anastasia remains secret to this day. The film, rather than offer closure, presents more questions than answers - a fitting end to one of the 20th century's most tragic and compelling vanishing acts.",1057104000,7,2862,5.087234042553192

He chooses Anna (Ingrid Bergman) who was recently released from a mental asylum. He trains her in the royal ways, and they prepare for the important meeting with the Grand Duchess (Helen Hayes). Anna becomes fond of a Prince whom Anatasia once knew, but she is even more powerfully drawn to the General.

Ingrid Bergman plays Anna as a helpless waif who is fragile and confused, and only wants to be loved. Helen Hayes is marvelous as the majestic and vulnerable Grand Duchess and the scene where she meets ""Anastasia"" is quite touching. Yul Brynner's macho presence dominates the film, even when he's off-screen: The scene where we hear, but do not see, a drunken Annastasia flirting with a smoldering General is hot, hot, hot.

679898,5,6303562248,"This film is really rather a classical love story will stay in my heart forever. In my opinion, no one can see this film remaining indifferent or apathetic without feeling the incomparable charm of Ingrid Bergman&iexcl;s and Yul Brynner&iexcl;s throughout the story. As I remember, the first time I saw the film, it had already been on for about 1 hour on TV. Even if I didn&iexcl;t see it completely, I was still fascinated by both the complicated plot of the story and the wonderful performances of the actors/actresses. Some scenes in the film were very humorous. And the music which showed the characteristic of Russia in it also leave a deep impression on me. Now I have seen this film for several times, but every time I saw it, it always moved me a lot. Having seen many other films acted by Bergman or Brynner, I still think &iexcl;Anastasia&iexcl; is the one I like the most. Without kisses, embraces or sweet conversations, it would still be a romantic love classic forever. As a woman who roamed the streets, Anna might be the Grand Duchess of Russia or even only a poor, bewildered person. And what she only wanted was love. Since no one accepted her, no one cared about her, she even had a feeling suicidal. Then a Russian general found her and saved her. He wanted to train her to be Anastasia---the youngest daughter of Russia&iexcl;s last czar. What only attracted him was the ten million pounds. Bergman was weak, tender and gentle, on the opposite, Brynner was stern, hard and sharp. Is there any possibility that she would be able to change him? In the film, there were many very excellent details that showed the subtle relation between Anna and Bounine. On the one hand, Anna hated him for his only wish for money, hated his using her for his own purpose, hated his not understanding what she really longed for was. On the other hand, she had fallen in love with him. Therefore, she tried flirting with Prince Paul (her former fiance), trying to make Bounine feel jealous. Bergman&iexcl;s performance was so subtle, ingenious that make the story much more lively. Even if general Bounine was in love with her, too, he didn&iexcl;t show any concern on the surface. He wanted the money of the legacy, but he loved her more. He seemed rather fierce, but is kind at heart. How many &iexcl;contradictions&iexcl;! At the end of the story, Anna succeeded in changing him. The scene which left the deepest impression on me was their last conversation just before the ball. They tried to convey their real feelings to each other. But there were so many problems existing between them. Money or Love? The ending of he story was to be expected but unexpected as well. When Anastasia left from her grandmother again, who was so kind, was so approachable, was the person she had wanted to see for so many years. How sad she was at that moment! I was greatly touched by this scene. In the end, Anna and Bounine ran away to seek for their own happiness renouncing their claim to the money, in spite of the public. I supposed that Yul Brynner might be a most suitable actor to act the white Russian general. His looks, his expression, his posture, his performance, even his bald head were very great. The performances of the other actors/actresses (especially Helen Hayes and Martita Hunt) were also wonderful ones. Everyone must be deeply moved by Anastasia&iexcl;s close relation with her grandma particularly. The film was also memorable for the acting of the two main characters. The story told us that money or position doesn&iexcl;t mean love, happiness and freedom. In the film or in the real life, no matter what Anna was, whether she was real or just a imposter, it doesn&iexcl;t really matter. The most important thing is that the film showed us a history, a mystery, or even a legend. This film was written, directed, acted very well. When it was made in the 1950s, even my parents had not been born. But time doesn&iexcl;t mean discrepancy, either. I&iexcl;ll love the romantic splendid love story forever and I&iexcl;m quite sure that it would always be a classic in the film history forever.",1001894400,6,4110,4.725626740947075

There were always rumours that the youngest daughter Anastasia had survived and escaped, and many imposters tried to claim the crown.  The most credible was Anna Anderson, and this film explores her story.  Ingrid Bergman gives an excellent, touching performance at the amnesiac woman who seems to more know about the family than any imposter could. Yul Brynner is the Prince who tries to make her over into Anastasia for financial gain, only to discover she may be the real thing.  Helen Hayes is Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress, the one person's approval that could validate Bergman/Brynner's claim.  Hayes is terrific as the skeptical royal, tired of so many pretenders to the crown.  Her meeting scene with Bergman is one of the great scenes of all time.  The film is well made, directed, written, and acted, and even though science seems to have proven now that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia, this does not diminish from the film's impact, especially given that she knew so much that cannot be so easily explained.

Based on a Broadway play, this film tells an unforgettable story of a woman rescued from a suicide attempt to be passed off as a Russian princess. Slowly she regains memories of events that could only have happened to the real princess. In order to be accepted as the authentic Anastasia, she must be accepted by her grandmother. The confrontation scene between the Dowager Empress and Anastasia is one of the most wonderful scenes in film history. Ingrid Bergamn and Helen Hayes are superb. Bergman received an Academy Award and Hayes deserved one.
There is not a dull moment in this wonderful film. The whole cast is excellent. Yul Brynner proves that he could do more than just the King of Siam, Martita Hunt as the Empress lady-in-waiting provides wonderful comic moments. The whole cast could not be improved upon.
This is one film that definitely should be put on DVD.
There is one main departure from the Broadway play. In the play Anastasia leaves with the doctor who had treated her in a hospital before Yul Brynner stops her from suicide. This was actually a more satisfying conclusion than having Anastasia go off with Brynner's character, the conman who thought he was passing off a false Anastasia as the real thing. To make this change was simply to make Brynner's character more sympathetic and, I think, works against the film. But, unless the viewer is aware of this change, the film is a wonderful experience and deserves to be in the library of anyone who treasures wonderful performances and great stories.",980726400,7,1686,4.837370242214533

But her memory of the  very private incidents  moments spent with her parents, was amazing, &  could not have been tutored eg;the scene between her father and her uncle  in the former's study,which she overheard,unseen,playing behind a sofa,and  which she recalls in the movie,to her uncle, who had escaped from Russia,  by stating that Czar Nicholas II,had rebuked him for getting a woman in  trouble,could only have been known to a person who was present in the room  or was later revealed to someone by the rebuked prince, who passed it on to  Count Bonin(Yul Brynner),who in turn tutored Anna/ Anastasia. The  reminiscence of a scene between the Dowager Empress (her  Grandmother-Figgy),and Nicholas over the pearls which Anastasia's mother  wanted, but Figgy wouldn't oblige, could also not have been faked,as only a  member/s from the immediate family eg, Anastasia, could have overheard it  and recounted it in so much detail. However, it has been argued that one of  the servants must have come to know of the row,from where it reached  Bonin,and thence Anastasia. But the final bit of evidence, that Anastasia  used to cough when she was afraid,could not have been faked;the expression  on Ingrid Bergman's face, was of the wronged,sad woman searching for her  identity, and that convinced even Figgy, when Bergman first coughs and then  responds to her pet name with such a genuine emotion that a tribute must be  paid to her and to the dead Anna Anderson, if that scene between the  Dowager Empress and Anna/Anastasia did ever take place in real life. Ingrid  shone throughout the film,right from the moment when a sick tramp, she is  taken to a cellar to be measured against the approximated silhuouette of  Anastasia, her training lessons,her rebuke to a person who dared to light a  cigarette in her presence,her handling of a noble lady,who tried to test  her and was told off as being jealous because she was never received at  Court by the Empress, Anastasia's mother, are pure gems of superb acting.  Her flirtation with her former fiance ,trying to make Bonin feel jealous,  was done with great subtlety,on one side Bonin wanted her to be recognised  as the Grand Duchess, on the other, he was in love with her himself, and  she with him. She tried to convey to Bonin that she did not care to be the  last surviving heir to Czar Nicholas II, in order to marry her cousin. She  only longed to be loved and wanted by him,and in this she succeeds, after  she has a woman to woman talk with her Grandmother, who persuades her to do  what her heart tells her and not what the public wants,a  sensation,""The missing Grandduchess Anastasia, long believed dead,  found alive. As the sole heir to the wealth of the Romanovs, she shall  marry her cousin and former fiance, in accordance with what was arranged by  her late parents."" Figgy manages to convince her that for a woman  nothing is more important than being with man she loves and bringing up his  children. Her  marriage to her former fiancee & cousin would never have  given Anna/Anastasia what she craved most,discovering who she was with the  man she loved. At the end when both Anastasia and Bonin escape, to live  incognito, and the Empress is asked as to what would they tell the  guests,who had come to hear the imminent marriage announced formally , she  sums it all up very well,""I'll tell them to go home, because the play  is over."" Virtuoso performances by all. Ingrid Bergman deserved her  Oscar. I first saw the film in 1959,at age 7,and carried the thought  throughout the susequent years that perhaps the story was true, and  Anastasia had indeed escaped the assassins' bullets. But the DNA tests on  Anna Anderson and the discovery of the remains of the Late Czar's  family,including those of Anastasia, in 1997, shattered my, by then middle  aged, fantasies, but Ingrid Bergman lives on in my heart as the eternal  Anastasia. No amount of DNA tests and discovered remains can take that dear  lovely, vulnerable and yet noble, Anastasia away from me.",958003200,4,4600,4.832904884318766

7849992,4,6303562248,"Most of us know little about Russian history with much of it happening prior to the Communist takeover given little attention. We hear about Rasputin and Nicholas and Alexandria but not much, at least not as much as with other royal families. The only other story to receive much attention was that of Anastasia, the supposed lost daughter of the royal family who escaped execution and survived. Or did she?

Many came forward to claim they were Anastasia but none as famous as Anna Anderson. Here story was the basis for this film and several others. Her claim to be the long lost daughter lasted for decades and it wasn't until DNA results confirmed or denied her claim that the results were determined. But what we have here is a story that revolves around that possibility.

Yul Brynner, fresh from his successes with THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and THE KING AND I, stars as General Sergei Pavlovich Bounine, a Russian exile in Paris of nefarious character who will do anything to possess power and money. Displaced as he is we get the impression he is not above criminal activity and has been searching for just the right person to pass off as the long lost Anastasia.

It seems he has found the perfect foil for his plan, a woman who had a past involving a stay in an asylum, Anna Koureff (Ingrid Bergman). Something in her background makes it seem that she could potentially actually be the woman sought, but the odds are against it. With a bit of training and assistance Bounine intends to pass Anna off as the real thing and as a result lay partial claim to 10 million laying in an English bank, leftover funds from the royal family.

The only way to accomplish this is to pass Anna off as Anastasia to the Dowager Empress Marie Fedorovona (Helen Hayes) in Copenhagen. Hers is the determining factor that will decide if Anna is in fact Anastasia or not. With so many having tried to lay claim to the title it will not be an easy task.

But we have more going on here underneath the surface as Hollywood is want to do. As Bounine trains Anna the pair become close to one another. Beneath his brusque manner and treatment of Anna and her confusion as to whether or not she is who he has told her, an affection begins to grow. Its subtle, nearly not on display, but there all the more time they spend together. Whether or not the end result will involve them as a couple is in doubt but the chance is there.

The movie is not quite a romance but evolves into one coupled equally with the historical retelling of the search for Anastasia. This blending of fact and fiction makes for a slow moving film but an entertaining one at the same time. The film marked a comeback of sorts for actress Bergman who had fallen out of favor due to the strict moral at the time. Having had an open affair with director Roberto Rossellini in 1950 she had been denounced and looked down upon in American society. But her talent shown through and she worked her way back into the public eye with films like this one.

Once more Twilight Time has done an excellent job with the transfer on display here. Ive yet to see anything delivered from them that has fallen short. And like all of their titles this one is limited to so many copies so if you're interested get one before they're gone.",1500163200,,3270,4.467336683417085

The Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, their Civil War followed. In 1918 the Romanoff family, the hereditary rulers of Russia, were shot. Was there a survivor? They show a restaurant in Paris that has Russian food and a floor show. People attend church on Easter. Is one of them the Grand Duchess Anastasia? Men discuss a ten million pound inheritance and a corporation formed to find the Romanov heiress. Can they deliver to the stockholders? They have a candidate, a reasonable facsimile. This woman has scars like from bullets. She also spent time in a mad house. They offer her a chance for a better life. Anastasia is rehearsed in her history.

She is introduced to people authenticate her identity. Her training continues. Is this a strain? Will people testify to the identity of Anastasia? Not all believe her. Will the Dowager Empress see Anastasia? No, but they go to Copenhagen and attend the opera to meet people. She meets Prince Paul. The story runs on with comments by people. The Baroness visits Anastasia in her hotel room and questions her. Is she convinced? Will there be a royal betrothal? One man questions her about her hospital stay in 1920 Romania. There is another royal ball. Anastasia and the Baroness converse. Then Anastasia and Bunin leave. The play is over, go home.

This drama is based on an historical event, the claim that Anastasia Romanoff survived the family massacre and would claim the family fortune. If none of the family survived who would get their fortune? The government inherits abandoned property, after first advertising for any claimants. You may sometimes see the advertisements in newspapers. You won't miss much if you don't see this movie.",1498953600,,1716,4.951388888888889
