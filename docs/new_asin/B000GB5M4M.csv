2604494,4,B000GB5M4M,"ALF is a legend in my book.  Despite the syndicated copies of the fabulous TV show, I would still recommend this to any ALF fan.",1163030400,,128,4.12
2604495,5,B000GB5M4M,I bought this set to complete my ALF Series Collection.  I am a big ALF fan and have been one since the show was on the air.  The only problem I had with the DVD set is that some episodes appear on more than one of the sets of DVDs.  Other than that it is a great show for kids.  My daughters ages 3 and 5 love to watch this show also.  Must buy for all Alf Fans.,1163030400,,363,3.6025641025641026
2604496,4,B000GB5M4M,"I love this show. I was so excited when they were putting it out on DVD because I thought all I had were memories. That being said, I too was very disappointed in Lionsgate for putting episodes in Season four that were already in Season Three. Like none of us would notice? I highly recommend purchasing the DVD set anyway because ALF will always be great TV, just don't be disappointed if you get part way into an episode and say ""I've seen this already..."" and it's not because you recently watched it on actual TV.",1161216000,,517,4.395833333333333
2604497,3,B000GB5M4M,"I give the show 5 stars but the DVD release only 3. I know what you are thinking, he is giving 3 because of the syndicated version, but no. THe reason I give 3 stars is because of the repeated episodes from season 3. How disappointed I am with Lionsgate. I wish someone else owned the rights to release this show in its entirety, in its correct order and with no repeated shows from previous seasons.",1159401600,20,400,4.276315789473684
2604498,5,B000GB5M4M,"Always GREAT MEMORIES of this show. Yes they are syndicated versions but they still did a really Nice Job with all 4 Season Sets. Sit back , put your feet up and get ready for some good laughs with ALF!!!!!!!!!!",1158105600,4,211,4.3
2604499,4,B000GB5M4M,"All four seasons of ALF have been released in syndicated form.  Syndication is alright for TV, but is absolutely inexcusable for DVD releases.  Lions Gate claims that the reason is that the uncut versions were poorer quality, and thus decided to release the higher quality cut versions.  I for one would rather see a poor quality complete episode than a high quality edited one.  But I guess I'll just have to take what I'm given.

Despite these being cut episodes, this is still a good set.  The episodes run for at least 20 minutes, which is more than I can say for season 3.  (One episode in the third season set only lasted 18 minutes and 40 seconds.  That was absurd.)  And ALF is, as always, very funny.  I loved the episode where ALF catches a cold, and the one where he visits a senior home is very touching.

In conclusion, I recommend buying this set.  I think most fans have gotten over the syndication problem by now, and since the show is no longer on the air, I'm sure many fans will still enjoy seeing the episodes some way.  And it was the final season, so if you are a collector like me, you will want to have the complete set.",1157932800,2,1144,4.339622641509434
2604500,5,B000GB5M4M,"I love ALF and I still do enjoy watching the episodes. It's too bad that this is the last DVD package to come out featuring ALF's episodes. Who knows what the future may hold? How about a second reunion movie featuring The Tanners in a modern day setting. Just one more time?!

I am sure everyone is going to enjoy this (unfortunately last)  DVD package. This features the fourth and last season of ALF with some great crazy antics with the Ochmoneks and the introduction to Willie's brother Neal! I am sure every ALF fan will rejoice in owning the complete series and, if you've never seen ALF, watch the first season and move on to the other ones.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! And.......HATS OFF TO YA ALF-MEISTER!!!!",1155081600,5,714,4.650793650793651

2604555,1,B000GB5M4M,"I had earlier purchased the set of all 4 seasons which is the separate seasons packaged together as opposed to a single set containing all four seasons.  I recently discovered that the end of the 3rd episode and the entire 4th episode on disk 1 in season 4 would not play.  When I checked with Amazon I couldn't return the set because too much time had elapsed since I bought it for Christmas 2013 (I just got to season 4 now, June, 2014).  I really like the show so I wanted to be able to watch all the episodes so I spent the $9.99 to buy the 4th season separately.  The 1st disk in the 4th season set also wouldn't play. In fact it was slightly worse than the disk in my 4 season set.  Both disks appear flawless.  They simply will not play.  Apparently the disk was consistently poorly manufactured.  I'm returning this and living without the one episode.  Whatever.",1402272000,,870,4.354037267080745

2604563,5,B000GB5M4M,"My kids have watched the Alf dvds by far more than they have watched any other thing I have ever bought them. My son is 12 now and not into ""kid"" things too much anymore but his face was priceless when he opened season 4 of alf for Christmas.

2604564,3,B000GB5M4M,"Still great but not as good as the other three seasons but still better than most.

2604567,4,B000GB5M4M,"I had Season 1 of this and found Season 2 & 3 at a Pawn Shop, so I had to have Season 4 to complete the series. This is sort of a kooky TV series about an alien who is in a fuzzy suit and his attempts to live with a normal Earth Family. The show has many hilarious moments, as well as some Life Lessons. ALF is more like The Family's pet cat or dog who can talk and interact with them. How many of us have wished that our pet could talk to us?",1378944000,,443,3.625
2604568,1,B000GB5M4M,"This set is a big disappointment. It should contain all 24 episodes from season 4. It is packaged as follows:
Disc 1: 1-6
Disc 2: 7-12
Disc 3: 13-18
Disc 4: 19-24

Discs #s 1,2, & 4 are correct. But disc 3 contains (in this order) episodes 18, 15, 16, 17, 23, & 19. As you can see, not only are they out of order but episodes #13 & #14 are missing. No, they are not on any of the discs in the set. Plus episodes #19 & #23 appear on both discs 3 & 4. And the funny thing is that the description on the back of the packaging specifically talks about an episode featuring special guest star David Spade where ALF dreams he is the world's funniest comedian. This is episode #14. Too bad it isn't in the set.

What puzzles me is that some people indicate that their sets are fine. So it appears maybe there was a bad pressing that was later corrected. So I contacted Lionsgate (the manufacturer of the disc). They answered my email quickly and said they would send me a replacement disc. They said to allow 3-4 weeks for delivery. Well the disc arrived today. The bad news is that the replacement is exactly like the defective disc that came with the set. So I still can't see episodes #13 or #14. ALF is not complete in season 4.",1378425600,,1225,4.1645569620253164

2604591,2,B000GB5M4M,"I have been an ""Alf"" fan since the show originally aired.  This season, however was a huge disappointment.  Other reviewers have mentioned the repetition of some season 3 episodes, which annoyed me as well.  But I also just did not like the final handful of episodes with the political commentary (""Stayin' Alive"") and the entire episode devoted to whether or not Lynn will move in with her boyfriend (""I Gotta Be Me"").  Those were just plain stupid.  There are still a few decent episodes overall, but a lot were either boring or mildly offensive to me.  However, the real kick in the teeth is the very last episode (""Consider Me Gone"").  Way to leave viewers hanging, NBC.  They should have at least allowed for one more episode to tie up the loose ends and give viewers some sort of resolution.

So, after finishing this season, I just felt cheated and dissatisfied.  If I had just stopped after season 3, I think I would have been much happier.  Boo, NBC, for ruining this season.",1368230400,,984,4.630057803468208

2604596,3,B000GB5M4M,"Alf the show is top notch. It's very funny and very well done. Of course there is the occasional obligatory Liberal political one-liner tossed in to sully the otherwise excellent show, but you get used to that. The problem I have is the incredibly sloppy way the DVDs were put together. The producers didn't bother to put the episodes in order and with this set even had an episode from another season included while evidently omitting some of season four (or that's what I've heard--the omitting). There is no excuse for not taking the scant amount of time to organize this properly.

First of all, two episodes are repeated. That doesn't mean that they're two EXTRA episodes. It means that instead of the episode with the Hawaiian party and the one with David Spade, you get two episodes repeated. Where are the editors??

This season, there is a lot less interaction regarding the relationship of Alf and the kids. The Ochmonoks are in like 3? episodes and Jake isn't in it at all.

The best episode is the one where Alf sneaks into the nursing home to meet his favorite actress.

The last episode is emotional but a cliff hanger in the worst way. The producers thought there would be a 5th season so ended this as a 'to be continued'. But there was no 5th season and after this episode you'll be left with a 'wtf' face.",1357948800,,886,4.357575757575757

2604621,1,B000GB5M4M,"Hello all. I'm a big ALF fan and like most of you was disgusted by these releases, cut to shreds syndicates. Good news, Warner released ALF in its entirety, everything is there! I have several original broadcasts on tape and they all match up. As for the set up: the main menus are nill, simple numbers, no titles. The default language is of course in English and can be translated in others. The inserts are in German although, compared to the states' release, there's a description of each episode, ours doesn't have that. I bought the entire series in one box, and it has fur on it, lol. You can buy these individually of course. When I went to the German site (scroll to the bottom and you'll see the link) it offered translation, thank goodness. It took a little over a week for it to get here and that's standard shipping. So, it's worth a trip to German so to speak, I'm so glad I did.",1302652800,8,892,4.347305389221557

2604638,5,B000GB5M4M,"I have read some reviews of ""ALF - Season 4"" that state that there are missing episodes and repeat episodes from ""ALF - Season 3.""  First, there are NO missing episodes.  All episodes from season 4 are in this DVD collection.  Second, there are 1 or 2 episodes that were in the Season 3 collection that are included in the Season 4 collection. However, those episodes were Season 4 episodes that were included in the Season 3 collection by mistake.  I have the Season 3 collection as well and, although the extra Season 4 episodes were included in that collection, there are no missing episodes on that collection either.

All 4 DVD collections do include the syndicated versions of the episodes so they are shortened a bit.  Only a die-hard ALF fan will notice the shortened episodes but the shortening does not hinder the plot or story of the episodes.  You'll just miss an extra ALF line or two at the end of an episode in most cases.  I am just glad they released ALF on DVD in any form as this was and still is my favorite TV show.  Overall, you can't go wrong with any of these DVD sets.",1266537600,6,1093,4.398009950248756
2604639,5,B000GB5M4M,"This funny creature from outer space is always hilarious...The only thing that puzzles me and left me wondering about Season 4 in the final episode I feel like they didn't finish the plot to whether Alf went back to outer space or what really happened at the end of the final episode. I guess that was left to the imagination and to create my own ending. Of course in my mind I had this happy ending. So to me Season 4 of Alf was excellent. Regardless of the ending on the final episode I would give 2 thumbs up + 8 fingers + an extra few other hands. For me, myself, & I this was and is that good!",1266278400,,598,4.033613445378151

Season four had some great episodes including ""Staying Alive"", ""Hooked on a Feeling"", ""Lies, and the finale ""Consider Me Gone"".

It's the one where ALF thinks Teavor killed his wife and keeps having nightmares about him standing at the window with an ice pick.  I think it was the best episode they ever did.
