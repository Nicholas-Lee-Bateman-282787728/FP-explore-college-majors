8539459,5,B009BX4FT4,"What an interesting collection.

The best Hitler Documentary I have ever seen. Rare footage. Goes into why the Germans liked him and how he used that power to twist the war into a personal obsession.

""The Inheritors"" is an older feature, but I certainly liked it. Great acting. This film tackles the issue of fascism in society... who was it that latched on to the concepts of fascism and how they pushed it on those around them.

""Massacres"" was a fascinating look at the Eastern Theater, which I never learned much about when studying WWII... this is a must see. There is footage that seems theatrical, but I assume that is because it was pretty difficult to find legitimate footage of the actual battles that took place. That said, there are some VERY REAL images that are intense to say the least. Chilling what the Japanese did to the Chinese...

Overall, a great collection and an equally great deal for 300 minutes.",1362528000,,923,4.679012345679013
