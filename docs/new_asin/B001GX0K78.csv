This was very informative training information that I used to train all of my employees as to where we were going to take our company, how we were going to do it and how it involved all employees. I have tried several other means to communicate lean philosophies with limited success. This DVD was a very clear message that EVERYONE understood. I now have the buy-in from all my employees, especially my Staff level management you previously were hesitant and skeptical per previous failed attempts and implementing lean.
Thanks for putting out such a ground level comprehensive tool. We loved it and are seeing major successes at all of our plants regarding lead-time and cost reductions plus a hugh improvement in customer on time delivery and satisfaction. I also purchased your facilitators guide to running my own simulations and was able to conduct several sessions with no problems.
Your right, sometimes we make things too difficult and have to remember the k.i.s.s. methods.",1224288000,,993,5.024242424242424
