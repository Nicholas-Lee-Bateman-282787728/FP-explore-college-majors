2504948,5,B000E78DGC,"THE STORY: Set in the English middle ages, two boys are born a few minutes apart and by some twist of fate they are nearly identical in features. But their lives could not be more different as they grow up, as one is born a peasant named Tom Canty while the other is born Edward Tudor, the Prince of Wales. Both boys are frustrated with the negative side of their lives, and yearn for a change. The prince wants to get out and see how normal people live, away from the protective bubble of palace life. Tom would like to be able to eat better food, have a safe place to sleep, get an education, and see how the royals live. When the boys meet by chance, they decide to switch places, to finally see how the other half lives. But the grass is not always greener on the other side.

BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: A live action adaptation of Mark Twain's famous story, with a screenplay adaptation by Jack Whittingham. Walt Disney needed a high quality show for his first season at a new network having just moved his show from ABC to NBC. He already had a great action star on hand, popular Guy Williams of Zorro. Walt liked to use classic stories that were in the public domain, not only because they were cheaper than buying new stories, but he felt that period costume films do not become dated as quickly. So Walt personally approved this project and oversaw it's production, providing a generous budget to get the film completed with a strong cast, script, high quality sets and costumes, as well as shooting in England. Directed by Don Chaffey, who worked with the Disney Studios for many years also directing Greyfriars Bobby, Ride a Wild Pony, Born to Run, Horse Without a Head, Pete's Dragon, Moon Pilot, and Moon Spinners.

This film was shot at the Shepperton Studios in England. Made for television as a 3 episode story on NBC's ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"", airing on March 11, 18, & 25, 1962. The episodes were titled 1) The Pauper King, 2) The Merciful Law of the King, and 3) Long Live the Rightful King. The show was re-aired in August of 1962 and again in April of 1967. The film was edited together as a seamless movie for the overseas theatrical market in 1962. And in 1986 that re-edited version was released on VHS. As of this writing that is the only copy available today for purchase of this little gem.

The talented young Sean Scully played the roles of both the prince and the pauper, made possible with the same special effects movie magic used for Disney's ""Parent Trap"" movie the year before this movie was released. Scully also played the boy Peter in another rare Walt Disney Studio film, ""Almost Angels"", a fun story about the Vienna Boy's Choir.

The Prince and the Pauper production won T.V. Guide's award for ""Best Dramatic Program of the Year"", a really nice award for Disney.  Personally, I loved this movie. The pacing was good, great acting with a strong script, it had humor, great period costumes and sets, stirring music, action sequences, and more. I would love to see this on DVD some day, with some behind the scenes extras or interviews. They could also pair it with the 25 minute 1990 animated featurette of the same name made by Disney that features Mickey and the gang.",1225670400,15,3227,4.528301886792453

This is bad news for us Guy Williams fans, as I believe a subplot about his character's background has been removed.  His role is fairly minimal in what remains of the film.  I hope one day we can again see the entire film.

Still, the title refers to the ""prince and the pauper,"" and those characters are great fun.  The young actor does quite well, and the deception of one boy playing two parts is handled gracefully.

2505027,3,B000E78DGC,"The Disney movie The Prince and the Pauper premiered in North America in March, 1962, on Walt Disneys Wonderful World of Color in three 50 minute episodes totaling about 120 minutes of content. It premiered in the UK as a 93 minute 27 second film May 6, 1962. It premiered on NTSC, region 1, VHS in 1986 running 120 minutes 16 seconds, which is the format being reviewed here. It was not released on DVD (in either NTSC or PAL format), but the 94 minute version was released on Amazon.com as an Amazon Instant Video download to rent (since January 2011) and to buy (since October 2012).
 The 1962 Disney version follows the plot of Mark Twains novel more closely than the 1937 film in that Lord Hertford is loyal to the crown and simply believes that Tom is the Prince with mental issues. In the 1937 film, Lord Hertford is corrupt and self-serving, realizes that Tom is not Prince Edward, manipulates Tom, and tries to have the true prince assassinated. Also, in the 1937 film the Prince idolizes Lord Norfork (since the Princes uncle, Lord Hertford, has been turned into a corrupt self-serving individual), whereas in the novel and the 1962 Disney version the Prince detests Lord Norfork.
 In general, the acting is good, but the teleplay and/or editing has many issues, starting at the beginning palace scene which appears like poorly done second unit shots with voiceover narration to explain the birth of two nearly identical boys and the passage of time.
 The action begins with Tom performing his daily job, begging, and receiving a rare gift -- three ha-pennies. He spends the rest of his day daydreaming and misses his Latin lesson with Father Andrew. In Mark Twains novel, much is made of Toms devotion to Father Andrew, who taught Tom ways, a little Latin, and how to read and write, so much so that Tom would ask him to explain and enlarge on what they read -- this by way of explanation how Toms reasoning abilities amazed even adults. Such a devoted boy would not blow off a Latin lesson by daydreaming. When Tom (as king) is told the sentences being meted out for crimes (at 1:32:39 in the movie), this also undermines the believability that he finds each case to be illogical and orders each sentence be set aside.
 Like the novel, the 120 minute, 1962, Disney version includes an episode where Miles and Edward ride to Hendon Hall, but in the 1962 version Miles evil brother Hugh seeks to kill them and they are lucky to escape with their lives. In the novel, Miles is arrested at Hendon Hall for impersonating Hughs brother (Miles) whose death Hugh faked seven years earlier, and there is strong irony between Miles and Edwards situations, both being denied their birthrights, giving purpose to the episode. Except as a showcase for Guy Williams dueling abilities, the episode seems purposeless in the 1962 version, especially since Hughs treachery is never corrected as it is in the novel -- this probably explains why it was removed in the 94 minute releases.
 In the novel, Miles believes until the final scene that the boy he has been serving and protecting out of the goodness of his heart is delusional and is not Edward VI. In Disneys 1962 version, Miles picks up on clues that are not in the novel, the boys knowledge of sword fighting, of the direction they are traveling, and of the members of the royal court, and realizes (at 1:25:17) the boy is Edward VI. I like the filmmakers approach on this point.
 I was somewhat surprised to see both the Prince and Tom with quite short haircuts. However, portraits of Edward VI from the 1500s, most commonly by the court painter Guillim (William) Scrots, typically show him with short hair, which would require frequent haircuts and could be practical for a royal, but not for a pauper. However, this is more a criticism of Mark Twain than the filmmakers, even though the issue is not seen when one reads the novel.
 An obvious disadvantage of the VHS version is that the image has VHS quality. Amazon.com does not indicate the resolutions of their 94 minute downloads.",1404518400,5,4040,4.69774011299435
2505028,4,B000E78DGC,Disney and staff did a great job.  Would be five stars if they had included other parts of the story!,1403568000,,101,4.05
2505029,5,B000E78DGC,I have watched this movie many times over the years on various video formats.  It is a very interesting story and Disney did a great job with presenting the movie.

2505040,4,B000E78DGC,"This was one of my favorite films when I was a little girl, as were most movies produced by Walt Disney Studios in those days. I hadn't seen this in a long time, and the digital edition I own is of very good quality, considering the age of the film. And of course, Guy Williams lends a great performance as Miles Herndon.

Sean Scully did a wonderful job in this movie, but he does not have a twin brother. In the 1937 movie by the same name you had Billy and Bobby Mauch (identical twins) play the part of the Prince and Tom Canty. I think this movie could of been improved immensely if Walt Disney Studios could of spent the extra money in finding suitable twins to play this movie.",1389312000,,536,4.264705882352941

2505060,5,B000E78DGC,"In vivid color.

I have seen both the 1937 version with Errol Flynn, and the 2000 version with Aidan Quinn as Miles Hendon. Both are excellent. This Disney version is just as good. It is different enough to be interesting; even if you have seen the other versions. Likeable characters.

This version shows the prince having to study all day with no play. When the prince is told about the exciting things boys do in the outside world; he is eager to experience them.

The prince's experience on the outside makes him a merciful and just king.

Guy Williams, the father from ""Lost In Space-1965-TV-series"", and Disney's ""Zorro"", plays Miles Hendon in this version.

Picture quality was fine on a normal size TV. I did not notice colorization as I have with other films.

This movie takes you on a grand, childhood, adventure. You are right along in this wonderful story; back in the days of horses, swords, nobles, peasants, thieves, castles, kings, and adventurous children.

Disney should restore the full-length of this film. I noticed minor parts of the story were missing. Disney should put this on DVD; so people do not have to have a costly Internet-connection to watch it.",1311292800,7,1179,4.806930693069307

2505063,3,B000E78DGC,"I love this movie and remember watching it on TV in 3 parts when I was 12 years old. I have been dying to see it again now that Disney has released the Zorro series on DVDs. I am a huge fan of Guy Williams and wanted to see him filmed in color, not just colorized. I had been looking for this movie and bugging Disney to hurry up and come out with it as a Disney Treasures, so I was thrilled when I accidentally discovered I could rent it for $1.99 on Amazon's Video on Demand. I immediately sent it to my TiVo.

This is the edited version that cuts out parts that were in the 3-part TV series. Too bad, because one of those parts shows Guy Williams as Miles Hendon fencing at Hendon Hall with his evil brother. Luckily, there is a YouTube clip of that online.

I was disappointed in the video quality of this rental. It appears to have been converted from a bad VHS tape. If I could watch it on my iPhone, it would probably look fine but on a 52"" HD TV, it is really noticeable how poor quality the video is.

Still, for $1.99, I am glad I got to watch it since it is hard to get this movie otherwise. If Disney comes out with a good quality copy on DVD, I will buy it.",1296950400,18,1170,3.970212765957447

Even if the most viable means to release it is as a Disney Movie Club Exclusive, please Disney release this film on DVD.  Let the older generations relive their experience and let the newer generation be exposed to this terrific cinematic telling of a Mark Twain classic.

Updated on 2/12/14:

Here is an email I recently sent to the DMC's Member Advocate, urging the release of the full 150-minute three-part version of The Prince and the Pauper:

""I have been a longtime member of the Disney Movie Club and I would like to respectfully advocate for releasing The Prince and the Pauper (1962) starring Sean Scully and Guy Williams as a DMC Exclusive. The Prince and the Pauper first aired as a three-part television show on the Walt Disney anthology series on March 11, 18, and 25, 1962. The three episodes were entitled ""The Pauper King, ""The Merciful Law of the King,"" and ""Long Live the Rightful King."" It was later released theatrically in Europe in a 93-minute version (this shorter edited version is currently available via Amazon Instant Video). Please consider releasing the full three 50-minute television episodes from the Walt Disney anthology television series as a DMC Exclusive. If you read any reviews of the 93-minute theatrical version, one of the consistent complaints from viewers is that it feels like major plot elements are missing (which, of course, happens when a 150-minute program is edited down to 93 minutes).

Your truly outstanding DMC Exclusive release of The Magnificent Rebel would be an exceptional example to follow. Similar to The Prince and the Pauper, The Magnificent Rebel first aired as a two-part television show on the Walt Disney anthology series on November 18 and 25, 1962 and it too was released theatrically in Europe in a shorter edited version. Your laudable DMC Exclusive release of The Magnificent Rebel fully preserved the two full 50-minute television episodes and even included the Wonderful World of Color opening titles for Parts 1 and 2, Walt's intros for Parts 1 and 2, Walt's ending for Part 1, the preview of next week's Part 2 episodes, and the full credits for both parts. It was as complete a release of The Magnificent Rebel as any fan could hope for. I urge you to release The Prince and the Pauper in a similarly comprehensive fashion. It is arguably the best filmed version of the Mark Twain story and I would love for a newer generation of viewers (including my own children) to be exposed to this genuine gem from the Disney Vault.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.""

The film was edited together as a seamless movie for the overseas theatrical market in 1962. And in 1986 that re-edited version was released on VHS.

The talented young Sean Scully played the roles of both the prince and the pauper, made possible with the same special effects movie magic used for Disney's ""Parent Trap"" movie the year before this movie was released. Scully also played the boy Peter in another rare Walt Disney Studio film, ""Almost Angels"", a fun story about the Vienna Boy's Choir.

The Prince and the Pauper production won T.V. Guide's award for ""Best Dramatic Program of the Year"", a really nice award for Disney. Personally, I loved this movie. The pacing was good, great acting with a strong script, it had humor, great period costumes and sets, stirring music, action sequences, and more.

Walt liked to use classic stories that were in the public domain, not only because they were cheaper than new stories, but he felt that period costume films would not become dated as quickly. So Walt personally approved this project and oversaw it's production, providing a generous budget to get the film completed with a strong cast, quality sets, locations, and costumes. Directed by Don Chaffey, who worked with the Disney Studios for many years also directing Greyfriars Bobby, Ride a Wild Pony, Born to Run, and Horse Without a Head, Pete's Dragon, Moon Pilot, and Moon Spinners. This film was shot at the Shepperton Studios in England. Made for television as a 3 episode story on NBC's ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"", airing on March 11, 18, & 25, 1962. The episodes were titled 1) The Pauper King, 2) The Merciful Law of the King, and 3) Long Live the Rightful King. The show was re-aired in August of 1962 and again in April of 1967. The film was edited together as a seamless movie for the overseas theatrical market in 1962. And in 1986 that re-edited version was released on VHS. As of this writing that is the only copy available today for purchase of this little gem.
The talented young Sean Scully played the roles of both the prince and the pauper, made possible with the same movie magic used for Disney's ""Parent Trap"" movie the year before. this movie. Scully also played the boy Peter in the Disney film ""Almost Angels"", a story about the Vienna Boy's Choir. I absolutely loved this movie, the pacing was good, in fact this production won T.V. Guide's award for ""Best Dramatic Program of the Year"". It had humor, great period costumes, action, and more. I would love to see this on DVD some day, paired with the 25 minute 1990 animated featurette made by Disney.",1267488000,,2470,4.550561797752809
