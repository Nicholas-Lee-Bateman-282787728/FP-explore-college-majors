This the worst collection of three of the worst films I have ever seen.  I have a collection of over 500 horror films ranging from 1919 to 2009.
These three are dreadful:  bad acting, bad direction, and the worst gore sfx I have ever seen. I have seen better acting in a junior high school play.  Even tbe framing of the picture is way off; in the opening credits, a logo is visible, but the words are entirely out of the picture.  It is also apparent that much of the picture is lost because of the crude full frame aspect ratio, not as if that were much of a loss considering what we CAN see.  Bad, Bad, Bad.  I think I have been robbed.",1239840000,10,815,5.175572519083969
