4466607,4,B004U7EHJE,"Surprising and deliciously dark little romp with a macabre but genuinely funny story and a GREAT cast. Good direction, great sets, excellent lighting and a very cool vintage soundtrack provide the icing on the cake. Bon appetit.",1400889600,,228,5.1891891891891895
4466608,5,B004U7EHJE,I originally watched the movie on netflix Canada and had a hard time finding it to purchase. I then learned that it was and is released to Europe region 2 only. I was so happy to see Amazon.com made it available on demand for region 1.,1396656000,2,235,4.130434782608695
4466609,5,B004U7EHJE,Hard to find video--I'm so glad to have it and the price was very affordable.  I urge anyone who loves off-beat and rather dark but compelling stories to seek out this one for your permanent collection.,1382745600,,202,4.611111111111111
4466610,1,B004U7EHJE,Stephen  Tompkinson does not belong in  this Caliber  of Movies he is way too good of an  Actor for that.,1368057600,,105,4.1
4466611,5,B004U7EHJE,"I came across this on Netflix and had never heard of this film. I'd seen other early works with Daniel Craig, and figured I'd take a chance since the majority were pretty decent.  Granted, Craig doesn't play THE main character, but he is somewhat a key element and grows more involved as things go by.  Featuring Daniel Craig and Toni Collette, the Brits capitalize on their ability to produce dark and someone grotesque comedy that is repulsively attractive. It's rather like knowing you shouldn't go in that swift water, but finding it too hard to not jump headfirst in on a hot day.

Set on an island that has a huge tidal flat (somewhat reminiscent of Monty Python's ""Casltle AAAAgggghh"") where you can walk out quite a ways at low tide, Hotel Splendide is a decrepit old hotel that takes lessons from the old Kellogg wellness movement of years past, when all things odd were used as an excuse to get money out of gullible health-seeking people.  Craig is part of the family ownership and serves as chef, creating simply disgusting food that people ingest in the hopes of cleansing themselves.  Along comes Toni Collette's character, back from apparent exile, to introduce mayhem in the form of creative and fresh dishes that the guests find far more appetizing to the point where most give up on Craig's cooking....causing revolt to spread.  The eldest brother owner, as the revolt gains momentum goes more and more looney and wants to keep the old ways that ""mother"" used to hold so dear. Pops (the old man) just goes along with everything until finally even he tells the older brother that the mother's ways are a total crock.  Craig and Collette discover the mother's secret life of decadence as the brother's crazy obsessions come to a boil.

The twist on this revolves around where Craig's character more or less slowly awakens, while the eldest brother sinks equally into the abyss of mental instability is disturbingly funny and dark.  This is one film where you will have to consider something to keep your stomach in check...some of the scenes are truly gross...reminding me of the Mr. Creosote type grossness of Monty Python.  If you could take that, you'll enjoy this.",1367193600,2,2184,4.8
4466612,5,B004U7EHJE,"I really enjoyed this movie, and not just because Daniel Craig and Toni Collette are in it. All the acting is well done, and the plot and characters are so unique. The Hotel Splendide is a ""health"" spa powered by the guests' own methane gas, with an awful menu of eel and potatoes and an isolated group of residents who have forgotten the joy of living (and eating) and are out of touch with the real world. The movie is both goofy and poetic; a little ridiculous but very sweet and sad and uplifting all at the same time. It's unexpected at every turn - I'm so glad I gave it a chance. It's one of my new favorites.",1352505600,,616,4.184873949579832
4466613,1,B004U7EHJE,"Even though Daniel Craig is great eye candy, this movie is so bad it isn't worth the cost.  The gross out factor made me stop watching before the end",1330819200,2,149,4.137931034482759
4466614,5,B004U7EHJE,"I edited my previous review. This new one-off service of Amazon's will be the savior of those of us who search, usually fruitlessly, for oddball movies that might be called ""cult"" movies.

I ordered one copy for me and two more for ""foodie"" friends. This is the story of a family who own a ""health hotel"" on an island, with boat service once a month. The deceased mother had very strange ideas about the foods to cleanse your system and even weirder recipes. Nevertheless, the remaining family members carry on the business as she set it up -- except for one who left and became a chef on her own in the outside world. The odd people in residence, the bizarre plumbing system, and the recorded instructions left by the matriarch are among the things that make this a hilarious English comedy. And then the lady chef returns....",1320019200,3,827,4.587837837837838
4466615,5,B004U7EHJE,"Watch Hotel Splendede once and you will never forget it. This movie is impossible to forget. Love it or  hate it this movie is a classic of the most gruesomely dark humor I have ever seen. The management of the hotel has a formula for good health that has to been seen and even then you might not believe it. The humor is dark and the movie itself is dark, with good reason. If you have not seen it before you are in for a one of a kind cinematic experience.",1310342400,8,458,4.032967032967033
4466616,3,B004U7EHJE,"Who does eccentricity better than the Brits?  The movie opens with a young man's narrative as you are swept across the sea to an imposing, dark hotel, giving the impression it was resplendent in it's prime.  You enter the hotel with the guest, greeted with decrepitude and  memory of days gone by.  The catalyst is a woman who arrives unexpectedly, sending the schedule (and the kitchen) into a tailspin. One-by-one you will meet guests, employees and family, learning their secrets, their desires and fears.  There are surprises, mysteries to be solved, and bizarre inventions as you are led through the few days in which the movie takes place.  The casting was good, each actor making their role come to life. It was amusing to see Daniel Craig cast as a chef, making the recipes his mother created years before: a gross, slimy mass given to guests for ""their health"". This is not an Oscar movie, and the pace is methodical, but I would still say it is worth watching for the interesting mix of people and their stories.",1308700800,17,1022,4.713483146067416
4466617,4,B004U7EHJE,"This was a very quirky weird film ... but in the end, we liked it. Perfect silly film for a rainy Saturday night. It's worth watching ... on Amazon Prime.",1491696000,,154,4.166666666666667
4466618,1,B004U7EHJE,"Parental Warning: This movie should be rated ""R"". Definitely NOT a family-friendly film. In fact, to call this ""garbage""
would be an insult to actual ""garbage"".",1491523200,,160,5.1923076923076925
4466619,4,B004U7EHJE,"Enjoyed the film, however the description needs altering, Toni Collette is not his (Daniel Craig's) sister, in the story but a former Sou Chef.",1491004800,,143,5.0
4466620,4,B004U7EHJE,"If you are going through your Saturn Return [2nd] or are an Astrology buff... this movie will have you cheering by the end!  The heaviness at the start is almost too much to wade through, till you see it's a metaphor for every constricting energy in a poorly expressed Saturn. A ""High Colonic!"" LOL",1489795200,,298,4.518518518518518
4466621,4,B004U7EHJE,"So off the wall quirky, but very compelling watch",1487894400,,49,4.555555555555555
4466622,5,B004U7EHJE,"Totally quirky dark comedy and I absolutely loved it.  It has some top stars performing in it so they tamed down the quirkiness (I could have like even more stretches of the imagination).

This should appeal to those who enjoy the oddities in life, can laugh at some of the extreme characters, like a little bit of artsiness in film and get the clever use of the hotel as one of the characters.

Reminded me in some ways of ""Cold Comfort Farm,"" another very funny and odd movie with characters and farm that seem hard to believe, but they do exist all over the world.

Give it a try, you'll have a few good laughs.",1487548800,5,614,4.3130434782608695
4466623,4,B004U7EHJE,funny but at the same time VERY intense...at times very hard to watch but i cared enough about the characters to stick with it.. acting amazing !,1486598400,,145,4.407407407407407
4466624,5,B004U7EHJE,really bizarre,1486166400,,14,6.5
4466625,4,B004U7EHJE,"Filmed using the exterior of the beautiful Slieve Donard Hotel in Newcastle, Northern Ireland, welcome to a 'wellness centre'
that is anything but... This is a black comedy that would make Tim Burton proud, yet is quintessentially British.
Enjoy this romp with Daniel Craig and Toni Collette and a great cast of eccentrics as things unravel.",1485993600,9,341,5.107142857142857

4466629,1,B004U7EHJE,Creepy. Not funny.,1483920000,,18,5.333333333333333
4466630,5,B004U7EHJE,This is a gem of a film as only British dark comedies can be.  You might have to watch it more than once to catch the subtle nuances but it is well worth your time. As always Toni Collette is amazing;Daniel Craig is good (but he is better as Bond lol).  The supporting cast is good and it was well directed.,1481673600,3,307,4.016393442622951
4466631,1,B004U7EHJE,"Funk + Wagnall will give you the definition ---- out-and-out, down right inane and stupid; forget about ""comedy, weird

4466632,2,B004U7EHJE,Another early Daniel Craig movie. An old hotel on an island has a bunch of excentric characters and circumstances. Wierd setting and scenarios. Not worth the time to watch. This definately didn't push Craig into stardom.,1481328000,,220,5.138888888888889
4466633,3,B004U7EHJE,Kinda weird.,1481155200,,12,5.5
4466634,3,B004U7EHJE,very odd all around and Toni is miscast but otherwise amusing,1479168000,,61,4.636363636363637

8441296,5,B004U7EHJE,"Absolutely delightful to watch. One must see the symbolism and irony throughout from the color of clothing each character wears to chosen music. Well played. I enjoyed Daniel Craig's character. While it's not a tuxedo and suave mannerism in a James Bond film, his dingy chef attire and demeanor still grab your attention which makes him still incredibly irresistible.",1524960000,,367,5.237288135593221
8441297,5,B004U7EHJE,"A lovely, thoughtful movie. Daniel Craig and Toni Collette are both so charming. It's more of a literary piece, an independent film. Definitely not for everyone.",1523318400,,161,5.230769230769231
8441298,1,B004U7EHJE,"From start to finish, this was stomach churning. Was this made on some kind of frat boy dare to see how many gross scenes one could possibly cram into a movie?",1516406400,,159,4.161290322580645
8441299,5,B004U7EHJE,"I enjoyed the characters, cuisine, and the steampunk thread. Quirky, mith dark moments, yet satisfying and plain fun!",1516320000,,117,5.555555555555555
8441300,2,B004U7EHJE,"Unpleasant topics, potty humor, perhaps but with a stupid health twist. Too contrived to be funny and not enjoyable.  I like Toby Jones so I chose to watch and gave it two stars,  but I dislike this movie, a lot.",1513382400,2,212,4.275

8441304,1,B004U7EHJE,"This was a rather crappy film because it is all about crap.  Steamy, green colored nightmare of a film about crap.  There is not enough eye wash to prevent mental damage from this waste of good talent.  Sorry to be harsh, however, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1496793600,,269,4.34
8441305,5,B004U7EHJE,"I adore this movie - it's definitely weird, a bit twisted, and not (generally) for those into box office hits and rom-coms. If you like weird movies, you're likely to enjoy this one! Fantastic cast, before a lot of them were famous.",1494115200,,232,4.5476190476190474
