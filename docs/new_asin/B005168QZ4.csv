8498262,5,B005168QZ4,Good DVD... I enjoy the WTM ans Real tree DVD's... The hard work and dedication on making the DVD is worth getting.. I love the kills but it is an extra bonus seeing how they prepare food plots and what they use... would recommend and i will buy WTM15 when it comes out.. Thanks guys for a great DVD...,1335744000,,302,4.135593220338983
