5410547,5,B00AEFYVGU,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen! John Candy and Steve Martin at their best!! Particularly the highway scene!,1386979200,,118,4.95
5410548,4,B00AEFYVGU,"As much as I consider myself a movie lover and film fanatic, and as large of a collection of movies as I have, there are some truly beloved classics I have been late to the party for. One such film is ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"". For YEARS, I'd heard how wonderful it was and how it is the Thanksgiving standard for most people who watch movies. Somehow though, I never saw it. I LOVE Steve Martin and John Candy and I'm a holiday freak, but I just never saw this one until last year, when I received the Blu-Ray as a gift from a friend.

The film is basically an odd couple road trip movie in which a miserable rich guy finds himself repeatedly stuck as travel companion to a constantly optimistic and cheerful salesman of a distinctly lower rung as they try to get home for Thanksgiving. That might not be how late, great writer/producer/director of the film John Hughes would describe it exactly. I think what I see as ""rich"", he saw as upper middle class, but his upper middle class characters definitely count as rich in my neck of the woods. Candy's character is named Del, a man who probably WOULD be difficult to travel with, but who takes it on the chin from uptight Neal pretty much from the get-go. The two have unceasing troubles, but most of them are worse for Neal, more than anything because he is just not used to this kind of travel (and he certainly doesn't have the disposition for it).

As I said, this film is beloved, and there are many reasons for that. Just to name a few: One, it's got two of the greatest comedic actors in history. Two, it's directed by John Hughes, a legend to be sure. Three, and this is probably a pretty crucial reason, it's a Thanksgiving movie, and there really aren't many of those to be found. Hardly any, oddly enough (though I have my pitch for one I shared on my own site fairly recently). Myself, I am rather selective about the works of John Hughes. Some of his films I LOVE, some I just think are okay, and some don't appeal to me much at all. And, if you take a look at his filmography, you might be surprised at some of the films he penned. Some you probably thought were surely stinkers, like Baby's Day Out, or others you probably thought were simply ripoffs of previous John Hughes films, funnily enough. In fact, I just discovered he also wrote ""Dutch"", a movie I enjoyed at least as much as ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"", if not more, but with striking similarities. It's, again, a mishap ridden roadtrip to get an odd couple home in time for Thanksgiving.

Focusing on Planes/Trains though, this movie has its goods and bads. Overall, I enjoy it and the final scene makes it all worthwhile. It IS a good movie, no doubt, but not my ideal Thanksgiving movie by any means. To be honest, it has little to do with Thanksgiving except that we know the holiday is the passion driving Neal's desire to get home in a hurry. Well, joining his beloved family for the holiday, rather. For the most part though, it's a lot of road trip mishaps and bad experiences that are funny, sometimes hilarious, but sometimes a bit too serious to be either. John Hughes can make some hilarious comedies, and he can do some great dramas. This film has a lot of both. It wants to lean more on the comedy, at least that's the way its marketed, but in truth, though I love Steve Martin, the frequent anger of the Neal character sometimes is too much of a dark cloud over everything. I know most won't agree with me, but I wish this movie was a bit more lighthearted. It's powerful in the way these characters learn from each other, especially Neal learning from Del, and I get the sharp contrast between the characters' personalities, but as a movie I've twice found myself watching on Thanksgiving night with family, I think I'd have enjoyed it more if there was a bit less hate in Neal's anger. It's realistic though, not the usual, Steve Martin, over-the-top funny kind of angry. It's well done, and it's classic John Hughes in that this movie is full of very realistic characters well portrayed. Watching it, it's recognizable as a Hughes 80's film (though distinctly a later one), even if you've never seen it before. But, ya know, I think even a bit more holiday imagery might have made the anger more tolerable. I realize the point was probably that the holiday feeling was a goal that needed to be reached, but again, this all makes it seem less of a holiday treat and more of an anytime movie. So, maybe this WASN'T intended to be a Thanksgiving perennial? I don't really know. Then again, those final scenes are perfect for Thanksgiving evening and will surely bring a tear to your eye if you have a heart at all.

With a generally positive feeling towards this movie, I'll comment negatively on one other thing, and that's the film's music. I just wasn't loving the score. I suppose that's just me, but I didn't care for it. There are songs in the movie that are good enough (I'm not wild about much of the 80's Hughes music/songs used in general though, I'll admit, with some exceptions), but the basic instrumental stuff I just found weird. However, if I continue to watch this traditionally, it's possible the music will grow on me. I think the fact that I didn't grow up watching this one as a tradition is partly why you readers probably think I'm being a bit hard on it. There's a lot to be said for the power of nostalgia.

Having said all that, I do like this movie overall. It is no Home Alone, Sixteen Candles, Vacation, Weird Science or Ferris Bueller for me, but, ya know, I'm not a big Breakfast Club, She's Having a Baby or Pretty in Pink fan. I guess I lean towards the pure comedies when it comes to John Hughes, and while I feel this film was supposed to be in that camp, I think it's actually smack dab in the middle, and that's probably why my feelings on it are pretty mixed.

Now, as for the blu-ray, it looks and sounds fantastic. There is, sadly, no commentary track, but there are some very nice bonus features, particularly focusing on tributes to the late John Hughes and John Candy. We also get a deleted scene with a pretty attractive stewardess getting angry. The featurettes have some great ""back in the day"" interviews with Steve Martin, John Candy, and John Hughes, and it's really nice to see that on here. If you can land a slipcover, there's a pretty nice holographic one out there. It's a pretty sweet release. The only major negative, aside from lacking the basics of a commentary track and theatrical trailer, is that the menu is a bit hard to work. By that, I mean that it is very hard to see which text is highlighted for selection, as it goes from dark blue to black when highlighted and is very hard to distinguish. It becomes a bit of a guessing game to go through the special features. But, that's my biggest quibble. This is, for the most part, a really nice release for a movie that is much loved and, though a bit heavy for me at times with a holiday comedy viewing in mind, is very powerful overall. I know I will enjoy watching this movie repeatedly, though I haven't found my ideal Thanksgiving movie yet.",1385683200,,7114,4.455871066768995

Andrews Blu-ray Review: PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES [1987] written, directed and produced by John Hughes, is a very funny film, deftly blending hilarity, humanity and John Candy, one of the two stars of PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, has a line that goes: The last thing I want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth. It adds poignancy to the film as you watch it now, given that, within a few years, John Candy would be dead from a heart attack at the age of 44. It also adds an engaging authenticity, especially when you cannot help imagining that, in real life, John Candy wasn't all that different from is character Del Griffith, his overweight, heavy-smoking, eager-to-please character in the film.

Certain comedies surprise us, not simply for their premise or plot scenario or funny gags, but in their overflowing heart, blinding truth and how good they make us feel. PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, is one of those films. Though it does feature its own special twist of comedy, the real surprise is left after the revelation, a film with more perspective on life than anything weve come to expect from a road trip buddy comedy of its kind. Then again, should we expect anything less from director/screenwriter John Hughes?

So here we find Neal Page [Steve Martin] two days before Thanksgiving, where Neal is over-stressed workaholic and tries to get from his business trip in New York City back home to Chicago so he can be with his family for the holidays. The trip cannot start soon enough, as Neal Page endures an excruciatingly slow day at the office, then loses a mad dash for a cab driven by Kevin Bacon. Neal Page finally arrives at the airport, only to learn that his flight has been cancelled due to a heavy snowstorm. With his patience already stretched, he encounters the last thing he desires: a shower-curtain-ring salesman who won't shut up named Del Griffith [John Candy] in one of his best role.

Fate of course brings them together as side-by-side passengers on the next available flight, where Del Griffith ironically says, The last thing I want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth, and Del Griffith also introduces the sore foot phrase my dogs are barking, which of course women in high heels always quote to this day. Sure enough, the flight is unexpectedly grounded due to in climate weather, forcing Neal Page and Del Griffith have to stay the night in remote Wichita, Kansas, and share a shoddy motel room together and with only one bed. Note Steve Martin and John Candys simultaneous realisation that those aren't pillows, followed by their awkwardly hilarious attempt at masculinity: Did you see that Bears game?

The cramped space causes Neal Page to snap and scream out his new travel companions name. The conflict gives both actors the perfect platforms for their respective personae. Steve Martin nails the pissed off traveller, rattling off a diatribe of comedy: Honey, Id like you to meet Del Griffith and hes got some amusing anecdotes for you. Oh and heres a gun so you can blow your brains out. John Candy answers as the ultimate consummate charmer, whose feelings have been hurt, countering with a few heartfelt words of his own: Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you, but I don't like to hurt peoples feelings. Well, you think what you want about me. Im not changing.

If viewers were withholding judgment on John Candys character, where Del Griffith may not know when to shut his mouth, but his heart is as good as gold. Steve Martin seems to understand this, feeling badly as he climbs back into bed. The rest of the film dares him to overlook John Candys blunders if for no other reason than his good intentions. The comedy comes in how hard this is for Steve Martin to do, considering the countless mishaps that befall the two on their progressively ill-fated journey on planes, trains and automobiles.

Having already hit the holiday road in his script for National Lampoons Vacation [1983], director John Hughes dreams up every road-trip mishap imaginable for PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, inspiring the all buddy road comedies to follow. As John Candy and Steve Martin shiver down the road, you can see the seeds of the human comedy in future buddy films. During the legendary Youre going the wrong way! highway scene, John Candys brief transformation into a red devil inspired Norm MacDonalds bizarre hallucination of Adam Sandler in Dirty Work [1998] film.

Most obviously, the notion of John Candy on a road trip was repeated by John Hughes himself in Home Alone [1990], where John Candy approaches Catherine OHara at an airport and just like what happens when Del Griffith does the same with Neal Page, and helps get her home via a Budget moving van. Only here, hes no shower curtain ring salesman. Hes the self-proclaimed Polka King of the Midwest.

But while such scenes have become classics, they aren't the chief reason why the film is beloved by both the public and the critics alike. The real reason becomes touchingly obvious during its memorable conclusion. After hitting us with a barrage of screwball comedy gags, John Hughes offers a twist that suddenly makes us aware of the important details we blindly overlooked (i.e. John Candys trunk). As Steve Martin rides the train home, he wakes up to a possibility he never considered, as John Hughes inserts a Sixth Sense style montage of flashbacks, especially with the diner scene, a motel scene toasting their wives, that makes viewers instantly want to go back and watch the film again, and viewing this hilarious madcap film, brings a newfound respect for John Candys hilarious screwball comedy performance, and how much better the film is because of it. Its this element that gives PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES the key ingredient of all the best holiday films and an intangible, unmistakable warmth of humanity.

With the final shot of John Candys smiling face, freeze-framed and fading out to the song Every Time You Go Away, and of course wasn't his last with director John Hughes, especially with Uncle Buck and Home Alone, but its the most fitting, considering that sadly John Candy died of a heart attack several years later at the young age of 43. PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES remains a memorial to this comedic genius, who was so similar to the Del Griffith character he played.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Paramount Home Entertainment brings you PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES a great 1080p encoded image, with an equally good looking 1.78:1 aspect ratio, that really shows off the film in a good presentation. Colour presentation is really nice here and there is some good fine detail presentation throughout, someone went a little overboard in the DNR [digital noise reduction] department giving most of the human elements in the film some slightly looking waxy skin tones. Texture of the clothing and other items in the film does not suffer too much. On the plus side, again, colours look great and black levels are pretty strong.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Home Entertainment brings you a great 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio that helps to go with so many wacky situations and modes of transportation in Planes, Trains and Automobiles, you'd probably expect this to be a more immersive experience. The DTS-HD Master Audio track definitely shows off some of those effects; certainly more than most comedies. However, the main attraction here is the hilarious dialogue, with every word being crystal-clear and quite awesome. So overall it is quite a nice pleasant presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Getting There is Half the Fun: The Story of PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [16:38] We are at the Paramount Pictures Stage 17 for a press conference with John Hughes [Writer/Producer/Director], Steve Martin [Neal Page], and John Candy [Del Griffith] where they talk and asked questions about the film PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, the script, and making it along with some clips from the film. The press ask John Hughes the question, Where did the idea come from and how did you choose John and Steve, and of course John Hughes goes into great detail how it all evolved. The press ask Steve and John what attracted them to the characters in the film, and they all reply that the script was so funny and could not stop laughing. We are also informed from John Hughes that it took him only four days to draft the script, but then admits that it took him 20 to 30 days rewrite the script. But Steve had to admit he was very jealous of this, because when he writes a script he usually takes 6 months to produce a script. Someone asks why has it taken Steve and John so long to work together and they reply that it is the way things happen sometimes and joke sarcastically about why each of them haven't worked with other big star actors, which is very funny banter with their comments, but most important they both had a great time working together. But most important is that we are informed that both comic actors had amazing timing and two actors who really know how to play comedy together in a film. We also get input from other contributors who were not at the press conference. Of course the subject arose from the press about the swearing in the film and how it affected the film ratings in America, which John Hughes points out that it only happened in one sequence, but Steve Martin points out that he swore 19 times, and also points out that at each screening not one person complained about that particular scene, but of course when shown on American TV, of course it was heavily censored. They of course was asked about the bedroom room scene where Steve and John had to share a bed together and that they had to do 10 takes because everyone was laughing so much. So eventually the press conference comes to an end, but of course loads of photos were taken of John Hughes, Steve Martin and John Candy, as well as signing lots of autographs. This is a great fun to watch especially since I am a big fan of Steve Martin and John Candy; especially there is loads of very funny banter between Steve Martin and John Candy and a joy to watch, especially if you are a super fan of either of the actors. Extra Contributors include Neil A. Machlis [Executive Producer], Michael McKean [State Trooper], Jane Jenkins [Casting Director], Janet Hirshenson [Casting Director], Edie McClurg [Car Rental Agent] and Kevin Bacon [Taxi Racer].

Special Feature: John Hughes: Life Moves Pretty Fast [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [27:39] This feature is separated into 2 parts. In the first feature we take a look back at the life of John Hughes by several cast members from his films. We get to hear their thoughts on John Hughes and learn the details of his career path that led him to becoming a director and a spokesman for many people. This is a really nice tribute to John Hughes who was one of the most influential writers/directors/producers of that period in time. So all in all it is a very nice tribute.

Special Feature Part 1: John Hughes: The Voice of a Generation [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [27:39] Here John Hughes [Writer/Director/Producer] basically stars talking about his childhood days and how his parents were very strict in not allowing John to go to the cinema and says, John, why would you want to go and sit in a darken room, which a bunch of people you do not know watching something on a Saturday where it is sunny and instead you could be cleaning out the garage. We get lots of input from people praising John Hughes who have been involved in his films and tell us that John Hughes is a fun guy to work with, who is also a very funny guy. But they also inform us that there was another side to Johns personality in being very complicated, very quiet, but 98% of the time he was very positive in his outlook, as well as upbeat, but sadly he smoked too many cigarettes, but overall John was a great force of nature. But what John wanted out of life is to be accepted as a writer, as that was his goal in life in general, and what started his career off was writing for the National Lampoon publication and that is how he was recognised for his multitude of talents, which John found to be a very liberating experience. What they say about John Hughes is that he was very knowledgeable and how he soaked up so much information and the things he experience when meeting people, who he found fascinating and would file information away for future projects, especially when writing scripts and then of course he would then incorporate all that information that happened to him. They also say John was a very good listener, especially with interesting people who would talk to him, and so making him have a writers brain. John Hughes talks about his relationship with his actors and a look into his writing style and methods. It also recounts his difficulties of working in Hollywood and his departure from the industry and his eventual unfortunate death. At the end of this special feature we get a final word from John Hughes, where he says, There are characters in my films that people can relate to, but most important, lets have fun. Finally, when you get to see the individual interviews with John Hughes sitting on his own and the quality if the video is absolutely atrocious and cannot understand why it is so bad compared to all the other interviews. Contributors include Howard Deutch [Director of Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful], Matthew Broderick [Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off], Lauren Shuler Donner [Producer of Mr. Mom and Pretty in Pink], Jon Cryer [Duckie in Pretty in Pink], Marilyn Vance [Costume Designer], Matty Simmons [Producer for National Lampoon], Lea Thompson [Amanda Jones in Some Kind of Wonderful], Alan Ruck [Cameron in Ferris Buellers Day Off], Mia Sara [Sloane in Ferris Buellers Day Off], John Candy [Del Griffith in Planes, Trains and Automobiles], Eric Stoltz [Keith in Some Kind of Wonderful] and Mary Stuart Masterson [Watts in Some Kind of Wonderful].

Special Feature Part 2: Heartbreak and Triumph: The Legacy of John Hughes [1987] [1080p] [1.78:1] [25:52] This is of course a follow up and extension to the previous special feature, but with this one they concentrated and go into great detail on his films that he was personally involved when he did the screenplay, was the producer and of course being the director, and especially all the actors that appeared in his films. We find out that John Hughes was a massive music nerd and loved the British Sound which of course he used in his films, especially the film Pretty in Pink, and was a pivotal part of any of his films, and in doing so, having the songs in his films, launched these Groups to be a big success in America. We find out that John Hughes was getting very disillusioned with the film industry and wanted to pursue other projects, like buying a massive plot of land just outside of Chicago and raising 18th Century cattle, and also built an amazing property and was very ahead in green projects and planted hundreds of trees. Despite John Hughes turning his back on the film industry, he would still keep his hand in writing loads of scripts, lots of books and also diaries. Sadly of course he sadly passed away and everyone who spoke in these special features, were very sad of the loss with him not being around anymore and a great loss to the film industry. A lot of what you viewed in the previous special feature, and sometimes information gets repeated in this special feature. Finally, once again when you get to see the individual interviews with John Hughes sitting on his own and the quality if the video is absolutely atrocious and cannot understand why it is so bad compared to all the other interviews. On top of all that, for some unknown reason the lip sync is way out of alignment and cannot understand why this has happened, as it is an extension to the previous special feature and recorded at the same time. Contributors include Howard Deutch [Director of Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful], Marilyn Vance [Costume Designer], Lauren Shuler Donner [Producer of Mr. Mom and Pretty in Pink], Jon Cryer [Duckie in Pretty in Pink], Alan Ruck [Cameron in Ferris Buellers Day Off], Matty Simmons [Producer for National Lampoon], Lea Thompson [Amanda Jones in Some Kind of Wonderful], Matthew Broderick [Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off], Jennifer Grey [Jenie Bueller in Ferris Buellers Day Off], Mia Sara [Sloane in Ferris Buellers Day Off], Kevin Bacon [Actor], Andrew McCarthy [Blane in Pretty in Pink] and Steve Martin [Neal Page in Planes, Trains and Automobiles]. Both features are totally worth the time viewing and especially since John Hughes passed away in 2009, this is a very fitting replacement for not having a directors audio commentary.

Special Feature: John Hughes for Adults [1987] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:02] Originally John Hughes was pigeon-holed as a writer/director for teenager films, and this special feature explores John Hughes foray into adult themed genre films and his style of bringing characters to his films. We also find out that John Hughes would keep the camera rolling just to capture the right mood for the scene he is filming. We also hear that all the actors that were in his films and were very honoured to be part of the film. So all in all, despite this was a very nice short feature and a sort of extension to the other two special features. Contributors include Kevin Bacon [Taxi Racer], Jane Jenkins [Casting Director], and Janet Hirshenson [Casting Director].

Special Feature: A Tribute to John Candy [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:00] Here we get a great dedication for John Candy and we get to hear comments from past cast and crew members that worked with him and telling us of their fond recollection of him and his acting talent. They also say he was a comic genius, a great actor, a very nice person, as well as a great teddy bear, who they again feel that we have lost one of the biggest comedy talent that ever lived, but most important, John Candy would always give time to talk to you, that again is why they feel a great affection for John Candy [1950  1994] All in all we all really miss this big comedic guy! Contributors include Steve Martin [Neal Page], Michael McKean [State Trooper], Edie McClurg [Car Rental Agent], Janet Hirshenson [Casting Director] and Jane Jenkins [Casting Director].

Special Feature: Deleted Scene: Airplane Food [1987] [1080p] [1.85:1] [3:00] Here we get to view the very funny sequence where you have John Candy sharing his extensive knowledge of airplane food that he would order with each flight he takes with different airlines and knew someone who prepared the food for the airlines and who had a terrible nasty accident, while Steve Martin looks at his plate in disgust and puts him off his food. This is a very funny sequence and cannot understand why it was deleted.

Finally, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES is timeless and almost is always equally funny. Of the many road trip comedies out there, this film ranks up there among the very best. There is just something magical about the film PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, something deep and heartfelt about the film PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES which is absolutely up there with one of John Hughes best films so far. It's funny, touching and has a stellar cast, all the way down to the many quickie cameos. PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES has got to be a timeless comedy classic of its time that I know you will sure to enjoy if you are not easily offended, especially if you love zany, off-the-wall comedy. Steve Martin and the late John Candy share perfect chemistry here, and this is easily one of the late John Hughes best comedies, which is really saying something. The high-definition transfer is surprising great for a late 1980s release, and there are plenty of great special features to help keep the Blu-ray disc spinning long after the credits roll up the screen. Those looking for a fun holiday treat should definitely consider adding this Blu-ray to their collections, as you're sure to have plenty of fun and lots of laughter watching this with your adult family members long after the holiday feast is over. Highly Recommended!

5410589,4,B00AEFYVGU,"After writing, directing, and producing a string of comedy hits about teenagers, John Hughes (""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Weird Science"") turned his attention to a movie about adults (as a kind of transition before turning to comedies about children in his later career).  In 1987 he got Steve Martin and John Candy involved in the comedic hazards of cross-country travel in ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles.""  The results were typically Hughes:  funny, zany, silly, a little bit dull and annoying, and, eventually, a whole lot sentimental.

I've talked to any number of people about the movie over the past few decades, most of whom have loved it.  But there are also those viewers for whom the movie is a major irritation, the movie's characters grating on their nerves.  Take your pick.  In any case, Paramount now make the movie available for the second time on Blu-ray disc, this time in honor of its twenty-fifth anniversary and no longer a Best Buy exclusive.

For those of you who haven't seen it, the film stars Steve Martin as Neal Page, an uptight marketing executive who's been out of town a few days for an important business presentation; now he wants only to fly home as quickly as possible to be with his family for Thanksgiving.  However, a mix-up in tickets and a severe snowstorm strand him in Wichita, Kansas, where he continues to meet up with a total stranger, a well-meaning but irritating and unwanted fellow traveler, Del Griffith, played by John Candy.  Del is a salesman for shower-curtain rings and, in his own words, ""an annoying blabbermouth.""  He's a bighearted, lovable lug, a persona Candy would pursue throughout his relatively short movie career.  Anyway, Neal can't shake him (""Stick with me""), and together they get into a series of sometimes humorous, sometimes peevish mishaps.

Stuck in Wichita, they get a room together in a cheap motel Del recommends, but they not only have to share the room, they have to share a water bed together, with predictable results.  ""Those aren't pillows!""

Del never stops making noise:  talking, cracking his knuckles, clearing his sinuses.  The pair make an obvious take-off on ""The Odd Couple.""  Del gets on Neal's nerves from the moment they meet.  ""It's like going on a date with a Chatty Cathy doll!""

There are some big laughs in the story among some frivolous gags and some decidedly flat ones.  A thief steals all their money in the motel room.  Not funny but necessary for later plot developments.  With the airports snowed in and flights backed up, the fellows decide to take a train, which inevitably breaks down.  Again, not funny, but it does land them in hostile territory:  farmland.  Next, they try the bus, where they continue to bicker and argue, Del leading the passengers in a goofy sing-along.  After that, it's a rental car, gone missing.  Then another car, this one rented by Del.  Letting Del drive at night in a snow storm while singing to the radio and smoking a cigarette is an obvious recipe for disaster.  One catastrophe follows another.

Neal says Del is ""the biggest pain in the butt that ever came down the pike,"" and one can hardly disagree with him.  Yet, after the whole raucous journey, Hughes, who wrote, directed, and produced this one, ends it on a note viewers over the years have found either sweet and touching or pathetically manipulative.  It's that kind of movie.

Trivia note:  The cover art and all of the accompanying materials for the movie list the title as ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" with the word ""and"" spelled out.  However, the movie's opening title uses an ""&"" sign, which I have followed in this review.

Also, look for cameo appearances by several well-known faces, like Kevin Bacon as a man racing Neal for a cab, Ben Stein as an airport flight announcer, and Edie McClurg as a rental-car agent.

Except for a string of profanities at one point, which earns the film an R rating, there are no serious gross-out jokes involved.

Video:
For this second Blu-ray release, the folks at Paramount use the same dual-layer BD50 and MPEG-4/AVC encode they did last time for the transfer.  In other words, it's exactly the same disc.  The restored picture reduces the film's original 1.85:1 ratio to 1.78:1 to fit a widescreen TV, and the image is quite clean, sharp, bright, vivid, and well focused.  While there is a little natural print grain here and there, which we should expect, there is almost no sign of age or noise anywhere, even in dimmer, indoor scenes.  Skin tones look as natural as one could want, with more-than-adequate black levels to set off the colors.  In short, the PQ looks quite fine.

Audio:
The Blu-ray disc uses lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the soundtrack, which may seem like overkill for a film that is probably 99% dialogue.  However, it does what is probably a near-perfect job in reproducing the sonics.  The sound is quite clear and reasonably dynamic, with a wide stereo spread making up for any lack of surround activity, which is indeed sparse.  So the front-center channel takes the brunt of the load, with speech rendered smoothly and realistically.

Extras:
The first item on the Blu-ray disc is a sixteen-minute, making-of featurette, ""Getting There Is Half the Fun:  The Story of Planes, Trains and Automobiles.""  Following that is a two-part documentary in high def, ""John Hughes: Life Moves Pretty Fast,"" which includes ""The Voice of a Generation,"" twenty-seven minutes, and ""Heartbreak and Triumph: The Legacy of John Hughes,"" twenty-six minutes.  Together, they provide a fascinating glimpse into the writing, producing, and directing career of the late filmmaker.  Then, there is ""John Hughes for Adults,"" four minutes; ""A Tribute to John Candy,"" three minutes; and a deleted scene in high def, ""Airplane Food,"" three minutes.

The extras conclude with twenty-seven scene selections; bookmarks; a flimsy Eco-case; English, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  The disc comes housed in a flimsy BD Eco-case, the only difference from the previous Blu-ray packaging being the lack of a slipcover with a holographic picture on the front.

Parting Thoughts:
In 2010 director Todd Phillips pretty much remade ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" this time calling it ""Due Date,"" with Robert Downey, Jr. in the Steve Martin role and Zach Galifianakis in the John Candy part.  The newer film was more mean-spirited than the earlier one and Galifianakis's role less sympathetic than Candy's.  Filmmakers should leave some things alone, even when they're as uneven as they are here.",1434412800,,6712,4.984712230215828
