This movie reminds me of real life family drama. I really enjoyed this drama between two  brothers, the father, a sister and decesed mother.

This is a good movie and a teaching tool to teach folks about keeping family secrets and lies.

I am going to encourge everyone to watch this.  Maybe this movie can prevent others from making the same mistakes.

Thanks Amazon",1298678400,,395,4.735294117647059
8286622,2,B001CBUPCY,"Rick's brother, Travis, commits suicide and Rick is shedding no tears. He and his brother weren't close, they were far from it, in fact, and Rick (Sharif Atkins) did not front by pretending he was all broken up about Travis' (J. August Richards) death. What he did do was try to find out a few things for himself to prove his brother didn't deserve all of the praise his father gave him. Truths come to light and a hurtful secret is revealed.
I heard about this movie and it sounded interesting, however, I bought it for one reason - Sharif Atkins stars in it. I used to watch him years ago on ER and I'm always glad to come across a television show or movie he takes part in.
Now about this dvd - The story is good - I really did like it - but the film quality is lacking. Sometimes the picture is clear and sometimes it's fuzzy. Now, I get what the filmmakers were trying to do with the flashback scenes, but still the picture could have been better. And there are times when change in camera focus is a bit much. For instance, making the person who isn't talking in a shot look blurred while the person who is talking is focused; that was a bit overdone. This is why I gave only 2 stars; otherwise, I would have given it 4.",1247011200,,1226,4.1991525423728815
8286623,5,B001CBUPCY,"OMG,
This movie blew me away. It was clear at the end of the movie why they won the awards they have.  Well written, directing and acting. I agree with another reviewer about the back in time sequences. Threw me off in the beginning but everything made sense in the end.  Kudos to everyone who has worked on this film.  You deserve every bit of credit.  I HIGHLY recommend this film. A must see.

8286624,5,B001CBUPCY,"I just watched this film and thought it was terrific.

The script is well conceived, well written and skillfully layered...And the cast and their performances were great.

Wonderful shot choices, camera movement and execution. The experience was edgy and engaging on every level.

It took me a beat to understand the rhythms of the flashbacks [which was a good thing] and then once I realized what was happening I thought ~ wow, that's clever and pretty seamless...

J.D. is a true visualist...can't wait for his next one.",1218067200,,522,4.9655172413793105
8286625,5,B001CBUPCY,"PWGI is a solid suspense drama that takes the age-old sibling rivalry tale to refreshing new heights. It also has a great story that patiently builds tension into a climax you'll never see coming. J. August Richards, Sharif Atkins and vet Ron Canada lead a talented cast of fresh faces.",1217635200,,286,4.74
