603492,5,6303234399,"Alistair Sim plays the headmistress of a girls school and her bookie brother. The school gets investigated by a dowdy investigator posing as a teacher. I'll say no more about the plot, but will mention that it involves  a field hockey game where the entire other team is removed from the field  on stretchers, former government inspectors living in the summerhouse on  school property, and a racehorse secretly removed from a second story dorm  room (I won't tell you how).
This movie was probably banned just about  everywhere when it came out in the '50's (unless Brits were more accepting  than Yanks of preteen girls smoking, cussing, making hooch and betting on  horses).
I can't say enough good (or bad) things about this flick, so I  won't even try.",923097600,7,756,4.8062015503875966

603573,5,6303234399,"Where do modern jokes come from? If you are wondering this question look no further. The Belles Of St. Trinian's is a comedy milestone masterclass. This classic comedy film is about an outrageous all girl school named St. Trinian's. This is a school where everyone is out of control teachers and administration included. This is arguably one of the craziest learning institutions in film history.  The Belles Of St. Trinian's is definitely a landmark in the realm of British comedy and slapstick humor. There are many goofy elements and odd things that take place all throughout the film. St. Trinian Student activities include horse betting, brewing gin, experimenting with  nitroglycerin, and fighting teachers on the soccer field. The authorities are so terrified of the school they won't go near it. All of the jokes are executed in a very comical and clever fashion. The overall tone of ridiculousness can still be seen in modern sitcoms today. This film dates back to 1954 but its unique brand of comedy is still relevant today. It also packs a pretty strong sarcastic bite. It you think everthing was straight and conservative around this time period check this one out - it may change your outlook.

Oh Dear. Poor little Bessy. I warned her to be more careful with that nitroglycerin.

I've never seen such an exhibition of savagery! I shall stop it at once!

603575,5,6303234399,"the ""BELLES"" is one of the  funniest films i've had the fortune to view.  I first saw it in 1956 when it was on the old Chanel 9 MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE, and it simply blew me out of the water.  Alistair Sim in a dual role of Miss Fritton and her brother is perfection itself.  it is the tale of a girls school that houses the worstgroup of students on the face of the earth, taught by a staff of teachers that specialize in nothing.  the school teaches how  to make  gin in the science lab which is sold by the strange fellow  who seems to live in the bushes behind the school and is named  FLASH HARRY.  he also  places bets for the younger students on the local horse races.  this film has to be seen to believed.  you'll laugh from start to finish.  this way to the brownie's camp fire, no trash.

a perfect companion feature was this film along  with THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF  YOUR LIFE, a wacky english film about the accidental pairing of a boys school and a girls school, by an inept Ministry of Education.  the opposing heads of  each school are Alistair Sim and Margret Rutherford and you can take it from there.  i had the good fortune to see these two films on a double feature way back in 1959.",1267056000,27,1200,4.1798245614035086
603576,5,6303234399,I got this film because I had seen Alistar Sim in Green is for Danger and of course the Christmas Carol.  I was not disappointed as the film was entertaining and fast paced and of course Alistair Sim in his duel roles was terrific. The film arrived in good shape and on time.,1265846400,,275,4.188679245283019
603577,5,6303234399,It's not exactly sophisticated but it's uproarious. Joyce Grenfell and Alistair Sim are two of the greatest comic geniuses of cinema age. Really unmissable if your sense of humour stopped evolving at about age 10!,1265155200,16,213,5.114285714285714
603578,1,6303234399,"Most of the folks reviewing this film seem to have been searching for it out of a fond childhood memory. If you like really dry, old-fashioned British humor, maybe you will like this film?

However, I found this film to be absurdly boring. All of the girls in the film are completely undeveloped caricatures. The only developed character in the film is Sims. Of course Alistair Sims is a wonderful actor, but his voice can be grating when there is no other focus.

This is one of the few classic films where I actually preferred the remake. This film barely has a plot. At least in the remake the every single scene isn't focused on the Fritton character.

Don't get me wrong- I actually love British humor and classic films, but the humor in this film was a little too dry and the pace was a little too slow. Not to mention, the film quality (washed-out b&w picture quality and horrendously low budget sound) gives me a LITERAL migraine.",1264982400,2,938,4.538461538461538

603650,4,6303234399,"I don't have very many original things to say about this movie that haven't been said before by others.  Alastair Sim delivers a truly extraordinary performance as Miss Fritton, and it is such a remarkable performance not because he's very funny (which he is, of course . . . come on, this is Alastair Sim we're talking about here!), but because he pulls the whole thing off!  Flawlessly!  You sincerely forget that this character is being played by a man!  It's a tour-de-force.  But Sim is not the only thing to love about this movie, far from it.  George Cole delivers what should have been an instant classic performance as ""Flash"" Harry; he's really one of the most underrated actors I know of.  Joyce Grenfell and the rest of the cast are all commendable as well.  I am in no way familiar with the original ""Trinian's"" cartoons by Ronald Searle, so I cannot contest as to how faithful the movie is to the original source material, but the writing for this film is so clever and funny I often felt it necessary to pause the film while I allowed myself time to finish laughing.

I have not seen the rest of the St. Trinian's films, but I have heard their quality is exponentially decreased with each installment (like most franchises).  Honestly, it's hard to comprehend a follow-up without Sim involved.

My MAIN reason for writing this review was to inform everyone that this DVD advertised on amazon.com is NOT an official studio release; it is done by an independent company.  The quality IS very good, and I had no problems with it whatsoever (aside from the disc art, which was so thick with ink it smeared a bit on my fingers whenever I touched it, and the disc itself positively reeked, I kid you not, but just print your own label on top of it and problem solved).  The picture and audio are most serviceable.  I just wish it had been made more clear to me that this was not an official studio release when I was looking to purchase it.

SO, unless you have a Region 2 DVD player, this seems to be the best way to get ahold of this classic British comedy on this side of the Atlantic.  Hopefully the future will change that; there are a great many Alastair Sim films that are in dire need of some attention here in the U.S.!  But for now, this is a very good buy!",1230940800,12,2276,4.4326923076923075
603651,3,6303234399,We enjoyed this movie once we were able to transfer the tape to another tape.  It arrived broken.,1224806400,,97,4.388888888888889
603652,4,6303234399,"The opening section of this film is very funny. After the school holidays end the St Trinians girls return to their school. This causes panic in the local town. Shops are being boarded up, the local Policeman starts taking tablets and in the end the town is deserted. This is the best section of the film and you wouldn't expect it to maintain such a high standard. However it nearly does and laughs are to be had throughout the whole film.

The cast are a joy. The inimitable Alistair Sim stars as both Head-Mistress Millicent Fritton and her bookie brother Clarence. A young George Cole is Flash Harry. Amazingly Cole's character is very Arthur Daley like. I wonder if this was the original inspiration for Minder? With Joyce Grenfell, Irene Handl and Joan Sims as well the cast alone should have you watching.

The plot revolves around a race-horse owned by the father of one of the pupils. Naturally it is stolen and various factions of the St Trinians girls are involved. If you haven't seen the film for many years, this a great reminder of a classic period for British films. Wonderful comedy from a different era.",1194825600,17,1121,4.656565656565657

603654,5,6303234399,"I better add one, this is after all an essential movie, a total scream, with good old Alistair playing the usual multiple parts as a brother (a tout) and his sister, the headmistress (or ringleader) of a girl's school full of delinquents, but really professional ones, all wound up in scheming against each other.  This hangs right in there with the great British comedy classics, as does the follow up ""Blue Murder"", with Terry Thomas leading the bill.  The third installment has several returning cast members and a similar look and feel, but gets rather convoluted beyond the first reel.

I saw these when I was a kid at the one ""art house"" theater in town, and we became real Trinian fans, we use to go around singing the school song.  It hasn't had much notice in modern times, maybe the series got a bad rep from the follow ons, I don't know.  In any case, grab the first two and you'll be well rewarded.",1189382400,16,910,4.490909090909091
603655,5,6303234399,"""The Belles of St. Trinians"" is a movie that is worth your while to dig up and watch.  It's been about 50 years since it was made, and it's still funny.  The humor (one should know) comes from gags about alcoholic beverages, gambling, dishonesty, and well, more dishonesty ... all involving a private girls school in England.

The girls are sharp operators ... clever little imps with an infectious enthusiasum for playing pranks.  Even the head mistress of the school is fair game.

This lady, Millicent Fritton, is played by the very excellent (and very male) British actor Alastair Sim.  He does double duty by also playing ""Millie's"" evil brother Clarence.  He (Alistair Sim) does a great job playing Millie ... carrying it off with quite a flair ... as ""she"" outwits not only her brother, the ministry of education, the police, and the school's instructors, but even the girls themselves.

The gist of the story is this:  The girls have bet all their money on a horse (a sure winner) in an upcoming race.  Millie gets wind of ""the investment"" and, in an attempt to save the school from foreclosure, bets all of the school funds on the same horse.  Clarence (Millie's brother) has a substantial sum of money bet on a different horse, and, to ensure its winning, decides to kidnap (horse-nap?) the girls' horse ... forcing the girls to spring into action ... to avert the potential disaster.

The little actresses who play the girls are ... wonderful.  They inject the most fun into the movie.  George Cole performed with Alistair Sim in ""A Christmas Carol"" four years earlier.  He was a little green in that movie, but here, as ""Flash Harry"", he is ... perfect ... a joy everytime he's in a scene.  In fact, there are good comedic performances turned in by the entire cast.  Hermione Baddeley is here, but she is almost unrecognizable as Miss Drownder the school's English grammar instructor.

There are some memorable lines:

Millicent: (To the incoming students) You see, in other schools, girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world ... but ... when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared.

Millicent: (Sampling a chemistry class, um, experiment) It's got something ... I don't know quite what ... but send a few bottles up to my room.

Harry: She's right ... we don't want our good name dragged through the mud.

Millie:  The old girls!!  And all in primed condition.

The Sultan: ... to begin by presenting this cup for good conduct, which I understand has not been presented since 1927.

But this movie is an enjoyable farce ... and a romp for us viewers ... where the comedy comes at us without much of a lull ... just a fun movie to watch ... but one that might perhaps require a little explaining to children who join in to view it.",1104278400,11,2794,4.639511201629328
603656,4,6303234399,"""The Belles of St. Trinians"" is an old-fashioned wacky school comedy, full of wild kids and clueless adults. Set in an English private school, the girls of St. Trinians might just have been the first to establish this familiar film genre.
The girls are VERY wild, sometimes shockingly so, brewing up gin in chemistry class and then selling it through a local bootlegger, Flash Harry, or winning field hockey games by putting the opposing team and the referee in the hospital by whacking them with their hockey sticks. In light of current ""PC"" times, kids in films just aren't this wild anymore. Plenty of the humor just comes from seeing these kids in action.
Alistair Sim does good service in his double role as the corrupt Clarence and his twin sister, the optimistic yet still slightly corrupt Mrs. Fritton.  The other adults in this film range from clueless to incompetent,  such as the Board of Education inspectors who like the school so much they just never seem to leave.
""The Belles of St. Trinians"" is a bit dated, but that is part of its fun as well.",1084838400,6,1061,4.668449197860962
603657,4,6303234399,"Alastair Sim reprises, after a fashion, his barmy schoolmaster role from the 1950 film, ""The Happiest Days Of Your Life,"" only this time he's playing Margaret Rutheford's character, performing in drag as Miss Fritton, a dotty headmistress whose belief in a liberal, unstructured education has led to complete lawlessness and havoc at her private girl's school.  Sim also plays Miss Fritton's twin brother, a crooked bookie who locks horns with his sister over a rigged horse racing scam.  The joy of this movie comes from the anarchic behavior of the ill-mannered, blithely menacing students, who are surly, dishevelled and perhaps a bit worldly beyond their years.  (The film was based on a series of drawings by cartoonist Ronald Searle, sort of a ""Pippi Longstocking"" meets ""Lord Of The Flies"" scenario...)  There are also several choice character roles: Sims' gender-bending aside, there is a magnificent performance by George Cole, as ""Flash Harry"", a fast-talking but quite loveable con artist who helps sell the bootleg liquor the Fourth Form girls make in chemistry class, and Joyce Grenfell as a horsey, inept policewoman who is sent in undercover to find out just what's going on at St. Trinian's.  As with many postwar British comedies, the underlying theme is of a crass new age threatening to overtake the decorum of the old, established order, as typified by the hypocrisies of the adults in the film (Sim and the slovenly, venal school staff) and the more likeable slickness and unapologetic hucksterism of the Flash Harry character.  The depictation of the chaotic, unruly, cigarette smoking girls -- American style juvenile delinquents!  Egad! -- is also pretty funny.  The film runs at a brisk, slapstick pace, and the humor is often rather obvious and unsubtle, but when it hits the mark, it's a delight.",1054166400,24,1823,5.114478114478114

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Belles of St Trinian's [1954] reunited Alastair Sim and Joyce Grenfell and threw in a bevy of 1950s character actors. The standout is George Cole as Flash Harry, Arthur Daley's spiritual ancestor, but there's sterling support from Hermione Baddeley, Irene Handl, Beryl Reid, Joan Sims and Sid James, while cameos include Searle and his wife and editor Kaye Webb as concerned parents.

The Sultan of Makyad, concerned for the moral welfare of his daughter Fatima, decides to send her to St Trinian's, a school in Barchester, where he keeps his racehorses. As news reaches Barchester that term is about to start, shopkeepers board up their fronts and policemen panic. Bookmaker Clarence Fritton goes to see the headmistress, his sister Millicent, to persuade her to take his daughter Bella back despite her expulsion for arson, as he wants her to act as a spy, obtaining information about the Sultan's horses from Fatima. Miss Millicent Fritton grudgingly agrees after Clarence Fritton [Alastair Sim] threatens to tell their mother that she's mortgaged the family home to keep the school afloat.

St Trinian's is presided over the genial Miss Millicent Fritton [Alastair Sim], whose philosophy is summed up as: ""in other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared."" The girls themselves come in two categories, the fourth form, most closely resembling Ronald Searle's original drawings of ink-stained, ungovernable pranksters, and the much older sixth form, one of them is even married) sexually precocious to a degree that must have seemed somewhat alarming in 1954.

Sex, smoking, drinking and especially gambling is not on the official curriculum, but they're not exactly frowned upon, and one of the most telling moments comes when the unforgettable spiv Flash Harry [George Cole] a silver-tongued, pencil-'tached rogue who seems to dwell in the bushes in the school grounds, abetting the girls in various nefarious pursuits of bootleg gin, racing bets. Characterised by the shiftiest walk in film history, George Cole made an entire career out of this under-the-law persona. At one point in the film, he is asked if he's a teacher and he replies ""In a way"" his role as their bookie has certainly taught the girls plenty about economics.

The teaching staff is a dissolute bunch of wrecks, alcoholics, ex-cons, ingnues and insinuated, but not openly declared, and you have to remember that this was 1954 and where lesbians, played by a cadre of (underused) and by great British funny-ladies. Into the mix that includes Irene Handl, Beryl Reid, and Joan Sims strides Joyce Grenfell as the bumbling undercover police officer Ruby Gates whose precision-timed horsy exuberance and prat falling is about the only genuine innocence on show.

What this really means is that The Belles of St. Trinian's is all about the various layers of comedy from the various characters. There is the wonderful humour of Alastair Sim as headmistress Miss Millicent Fritton whilst also playing her brother Clarence Fritton and there is again, just as much jolly fun with the encourage able George Cole giving us Flash Harry a forerunner to his Arthur Daily. And of course there is the wonderful Joyce Grenfell who as undercover police woman Ruby Gates is a bounty of over exaggerated mannerisms especially her walk.

Artist Ronald Searle first invented the horde of unruly schoolgirls in 1941 while serving in World War II, producing a series of acerbic cartoons for satirical magazines Lilliput and Punch right through to 1953. This wasn't the innocent public school j apery of broken windows and dodging prep as depicted in Just William or the Jennings series. This amoral, pre-pubescent rabble were the punkettes of their day; smoking, gambling, fighting and running riot over their slipshod educational establishment like prototype Mafiosa in ill-fitting gymslips.

Whilst there is a lot of talent on show in ""The Belles of St. Trinian's"" and the sharp eyed amongst you will notice that on top of Joyce Grenfell there is also Sid James, Irene Handl, Joan Sims and the stunning Belinda Lee the stars are Alastair Sim and George Cole. In the case of George Cole his performance as Flash Harry is simply amusing, slick, fast talking and dodgy you just can't help but laugh especially whenever he walks to the school with his theme music playing. But even George Cole is over shadowed by Sim who not only plays one character but two, although it is as headmistress Millicent Fritton where he delivers so many laughs. It's such a daft character, slightly dodgy a little daft, very old fashioned and almost oblivious to some of the troubles whilst co-conspirator in others and everything which Sim does is simply funny.

What this all boils down to is that whilst The Belles of St. Trinian's was a film made well over 60 years ago and it is still as much fun now, as it ever has been. The storyline is slim but the humour runs thick and freely and that is what makes it so good, that and not only a wonderful performance by George Cole as Flash Harry but Alastair Sim who is simply wonderful righteous fun from start to end.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This Blu-Ray image transfer is really excellent and the film is full of deeply crushed monochromatic blacks which stand up remarkable well, making this a real visual treat. Stanley Paveys stunning cinematography. Presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1, and you get a brilliant 1080p encoded image. Generally speaking, depth and clarity are very pleasing. The majority of the close-ups, in particular, look very good. During the outdoor footage, shadow definition is also convincing. Contrast levels are stable, but there are areas of the film where minor inherited fluctuations are visible. Light grain is present throughout the entire film, but it is slightly toned down. There are no traces of problematic sharpening corrections and serious transition or stability issues to report. To sum it all up, STUDIOCANAL have done a stunning restoration of The Belles of St. Trinian's that will please fans of the film and especially of seeing the brilliant actor Alastair Sim in another stunning Classic British Comedy.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again with this STUDIOCANAL Blu-ray release, there is only one standard audio track and that is a 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio track. Plus, again they have only provided an optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. The sound is very crisp and clear, plus there are no sudden drops in dynamic activity. Rather predictably, and the dynamics is okay. All the usual clicks, pops, crackle, and background hiss you had with these old films, have been totally removed and the dialogue is stable and exceptionally easy to follow.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Features: The Girls of St Trinians [2014] [1080p] [16:9 / 4:3] [16:47] With this particular feature, we get to meet the girls, but now in their late youth, who originally appear in The Belles of St. Trinian's [1954] film and we get intimate interviews with these ladies in a proper studio. First up we meet Gillian Ferguson, who played the girl pupil Celeste West and was 11 years old at the time of the film. Next up we have Annabelle [Covey] Heath, who played the girl pupil Maudie [the bookie] and was also 11 years old in the film. Next up is a.k.a. Pauline Drewett who played Celia [Jackie West] in the film and was about 12 years of age in the film. Not only do we get informed that all of the young girls at the time were at Stage School and had to have a face to face audition in front of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat and were successful in getting the parts in the film. We also get black-and-white clips from the 1954 film. Some of the women said they felt intimidated by Alastair Sim, but some also thought he was a very funny man and especially seeing Alastair in drag, but all the women also praised Alastair Sim and respected him for being a great actor. All in all this a is a very nice little feature, with lots of intimate thoughts on all the women appearing in the film and how much thy thoroughly enjoyed their experience in the film. We are also informed that all the women went onto to do other things in their careers, like working in other films, working in Television, also in the Theatre, but also working in Panto, which again they thoroughly enjoyed.

Special Features: Interview with Alistair Sims Daughter Merlith McKendrick [2014] [1080p] [16:9 / 4:3] [4:58] here we get another angle on Alastair Sim, especially via his Daughter in this very intimate interview. Merlith McKendrick informs us that she really loved and also a lot of respect and affection for Alastair Sim her father and Merlith thought he was a brilliant actor and was also very funny, but when growing up did not realis how famous and successful Alastair Sim was. Merlith McKendrick also commented on George Cole and had a great deal of fun with George when Merlith was on the set of the film. We also get to see some more black-and-white clips from the 1954 film. Merlith also informs us that she loved seeing Alastair in drag and especially in that character in the film. But one thing Merlith would of loved, and that is to be able to go to a St. Trinians School and be naughty like all the characters in the film.

Special Features: Interview with Geoff Brown [Film Historian] [2014] [1080p] [16:9 / 4:3] [18:25] With this extra, Geoff brown talks about extensively about that period of time in the film industry and especially around the 1954 period when the film was made. He also talks extensively about Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, and also tells us that both of these men started in the film business around the 1928 silent film period. But both these men came into contact about the same time when they both worked for the same film company by accident and both slowly worked their way up the ladder of great success. Their first collaboration was on a screenplay for a film entitled Seven Sinners and was a thriller film about a sinister character who like making trains crash. Outside of the film industry, they both had totally different interests, Frank Launder on a Saturday, and liked to go the race track and gamble heavily, but he also owned a horse, which was the one used in the 1954 film. Whereas Sidney Gilliat would rather spend time at the Opera and especially at the Glyndebourne festivals. But despite their difference, they always worked well together. All in all this is quite a nice little feature, and especially the insight into both Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. But as a bonus we also get great praise from Geoff Brown about how brilliant an actor Alastair Sim was.

Special Features: Interview with Steve Chibnall [Professor of British Cinema, De Montfort University] [2014] [1080p] [16:9 / 4:3] [11:50] here Steve Chibnall also talks extensively about Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, who renowned for their comedy films, but they also dabbled into thriller films and one in particular was Alfred Hitchcocks film The Lady Vanishes, but they were much more happier working on comedy films, but sadly the St. Trinians films were the only ones they were associated with. One little interesting fact, is that Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat worked with Alastair Sim for well over 15 years and at the time was a very harmonious period of great collaboration. But by the time they finished filming the second St. Trinians film, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat had to part company with Alastair Sim, as they had a very bad atmosphere, especially with Sidney Gilliat, as Alastair keep forgetting is lines and near the end lost his temper and asked to leave the set. But all in all this again is a very nice short feature and a joy to watch.

Special Features: Interview with Melanie Williams [Senior Lecturer in Film Studies U.E.A.] [2014] [1080p] [16:9 / 4:3] [12:47] Melanie Williams is a very qualified Senior Lecturer on Film Studies, especially how young this lady is. And most of this interview is talking about the St. Trinians genre and fascinations about these particular films and how popular they were at the time. Melanie also talks about Ronald Searle very extensively, especially in the period when he was a Japanese P.O.W intern and that is where he started doing his cartoons, especially depicting the harsh reality of these harsh prisons. Melanie Williams has never really found out why these St. Trinians films were so popular, but Melanie Williams also mentions about how the critics at the time really slated these St. Trinians films, but Melanie thinks it is how the girls in the school are portrayed as nasty little urchins, who love to cause mayhem. Although the first St. Trinians films was a great success, but the follow up films, especially after the second film, were not such a great success, but Melanie suspects that from the third film onwards, the reason they were not a success is because Alastair Sim was not in them. But all in all, this again is a nice little feature, especially with Melanie Williams informing us with such knowledge on all these St. Trinians films and is a joy to listen to Melanie.

Finally, in a testament to Alastair Sim's expertise as a character actor, never once does the viewer consider Miss Millicent Fritton as anything less than all women, albeit in a 'horsey' home-counties mould and a benevolent matriarch to her wayward brood of pupils and teachers alike. Even the impact of this 1954 film has to always have a cast of British thespian grotesques charachters, who appear on screen as if they themselves stepped straight out of another world. From George Cole's two-bit dodgy dealer 'Flash Harry' a character he would later recreate so perfectly in the television's Minder - and Grenfell's scatty undercover policewoman Ruby Gates, to appearances by stalwarts like Beryl Reid, Joan Sims and Irene Handl as school mistresses, here is a cast who capture on screen that certain undefinable eccentricity which is uniquely English. It is Alistair Sim however, in the dual role of the school's headmistress and her ne'er-do-well brother, the bookmaker Clarence Fritton, who stands out. In his book, St. Trinian's: The Entire Appalling Business, Searle summed up his most famous creations by referring to a St. Trinian's pupil as, ""Sardonic, witty and very amusing. She would be good company. In short: typically human and, despite everything, endearing."" This is probably as good a description of The Belles of St. Trinian's as any, and explains why this film and especially this stunning Blu-ray release is as magical today, as it was when it was first released. Highly Recommended!

7841516,4,6303234399,"This is a fairly old film and the version here is a little grainy in parts. But that said it should not detract from the general overview of this great British comedy. it is hilariously funny - the story-line is as impossible to believe as it gets but with a near-farce like this it does not matter. The acting by Joyce Grenfell, George Cole and Alistair Sim is really quite marvelous in its own unique way. If you want a hilarious 90 minutes and do not mind the odd grainy picture then it is a must for your collection. A real romp of a film that despite its age does not date.",1418083200,,578,4.169642857142857

Yes, we know that a mob of children can be wild, but these girls are so clever and inventive that I delighted in their antics.
