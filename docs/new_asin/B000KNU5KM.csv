8158422,2,B000KNU5KM,"It's noteworthy with Clint Eastwood in it, even though it's just a bit part. I just can't like a movie when you can't understand what anybody is saying. I just reordered this movie from somewhere else for the ENGLISH version. I do not want to go to the expense of returning this. It's probably my fault for not reading the description correctly, anyway.  I don't understand why Amazon puts foreign products on American internet, which is crazy.",1408924800,,444,4.766233766233766
8158423,3,B000KNU5KM,"Inaccurate both historically and to the legend of Lady Godiva and her infamous nude ride through the streets of Coventry, this fictionalized version finds tensions high between the Saxons and Normans in 11th century England. A Saxon lord (George Nader) refuses the King's (Eduard Franz) wishes for a politically convenient marriage and instead opts to marry the sheriff's fiery daughter (Maureen O'Hara). But she becomes a militant Joan Of Arc heroine to the Saxon people, much to the disgruntlement of her husband. It's an innocuous film with very little to recommend it. Even the chance to see O'Hara au naturel is ruined by showing the ride in long shots with O'Hara's long flaming tresses discreetly covering her up. But it's modestly enjoyable in a Saturday afternoon matinee kind of way. Directed by Arthur Lubin and with Victor McLaglen (not instigated by John Ford, so he's rather restrained here), Torin Thatcher, Rex Reason, Kathryn Givney and keep a sharp lookout for a young Clint Eastwood as a Saxon solider.

The ClassicLine import from Brazil is a full frame transfer. It tends to be on the darkish side with excessive grain but it's eminently watchable.",1292889600,6,1169,5.05699481865285
