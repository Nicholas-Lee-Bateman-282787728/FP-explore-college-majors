I also like that it's a barefoot, low impact workout.  No special equipment needed.
Ellen is a master at easing you into some high intensity moves and then backing off just in time.  I also like how she lets the music set the rhythm in all of her dvd's.
Buy it!",1198886400,52,409,4.217948717948718
3044566,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Again Amazon is late releasing this - you can buy it online elsewhere.  I got my copy the other day and have already done this a couple of times.  I think Ellen is a great instructor.  She's encouraging and motivating and easy to listen to and she cues well.
This workout is Pilates/ballet/balance and the like.  It's a relaxing workout and while it's not cardio, your heart can be elevated if you find the moves a bit challenging.  I love the mermaid movements and the dancer plies.  It may look easy but while doing it, it's a good challenge and you can feel it the next day for sure.  It's not an intimidating workout if you aren't familiar with the moves - just watch the dvd through once or twice before trying it out.
It's about 45 minutes all up and it works you out really well.  I like this a lot and I'm going to try doing it 3 times a week along with plenty of cardio.",1197676800,15,879,4.190476190476191
3044567,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I bought this video thinking it would be an easier workout for those days I didn't want the high intensity.  WRONG! It gave me a great workout, left me feeling stretched out, and quite energized.  Great for the lower body.  It was graceful and flowing.  Highly Recommend!",1196467200,50,271,4.702127659574468

3044569,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Discovered this workout a few years ago when I was recovering from a lower leg injury.  Recently re-injured same leg and rushed to pull all my low impact/less strenuous workout DVDs.  Don't get me wrong--this video is absolutely challenging and I am always sweating at the finish.  (I am a regular, intermediate level exerciser.)  It puts minimal strain on the joints and I am able to do this workout currently with a sprained foot, with minor modifications.  Incorporates Pilates and some calisthenics and some ballet moves.  Geared towards women but don't be fooled--if you are a guy, you will get a good cardio workout, although most guys will find this workout a little too ""gay"".  Good music, great instructor, very energizing workout.",1446422400,,740,5.016393442622951

3044571,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Your Review:
I am not an Ellen groupie, but I am a fan. I've tried most of her workouts and kept the ones I really like - of which, this is one. And, it's one that I won't get rid of.

It is a fusion workout that includes several sets of flowing moves that lead into each other. The moves include standing pilates, abs, cardio, and other fusion-y moves. Ellen leads in a big open studio area with hardwood floor and good music and two background exercisers, one who shows easier modifications. You can play all or choose a chapter (but, I don't do this workout often enough to know the segments before I do them.)

Ellen does a wonderful job in this workout. The workout seems to fly by as the moves flow. She does several segments of combinations of moves. If the moves are done on one side, then she repeats them on the other side. If not, then you do them once. I get a cardio effect from this workout as it flows along. She does a really good job of providing form pointers on the technical side while highlighting the joy and peace that can be found in moving your body and inhabiting a good space in your head.

I've seen people say that the more they do it that the harder it becomes because they focus on form more and more. I have no problem believing it. However, as I do this workout periodically on a ""tired day"", I find it to be a high beginner to intermediate workout.

Instructor Comments:
She brings the joy of movement to this workout along with great cueing and instruction.",1436227200,5,1492,4.298932384341637
3044572,4,B000ZZT7BS,I hurt my knee and have to avoid high impact exercise for the time being so I bought this DVD. The time moves quickly so that is a plus but it is somehow overall slow paced. I did break a light sweat which was nice but I imagine I will quickly become bored which is too bad because I really liked Ellen Barrett's older workouts. Ellen provides great cuing and has modifications for beginners available. Overall it is relaxing as well which is nice and really focuses on alignment.,1432771200,,480,4.404494382022472
3044573,2,B000ZZT7BS,"Due to the great reviews I was excited about this DVD. I guess it would be great if I was older in age. I did the entire ""workout"" and didn't even work up a sweat. At least it keeps you moving",1432339200,,192,3.707317073170732

3044577,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I am in love.... I have 5 other Ellen Barrett DVDs. I was not going to buy anymore because when I previewed some of the other DVDs on Collage Video, I felt that they all seemed similar. I recently joined an Ellen Barrett Group on Facebook and the group members highly recommended this DVD. I have to admit that they were spot on. This was challenging in a good way. I worked out parts of my body that I normally don't feel the burn in afterwards. My hamstrings and back felt like they both got a good workout. I was tingly and sore in a good way. I like the fact that the moves in this DVD have a cardio, stretching and toning element all in one. This will be in rotation often.",1424390400,3,678,4.105263157894737

3044586,5,B000ZZT7BS,"My sister bought this tape for me 6 years ago and since then I have used it 3-4+ times/week. The stretching, etc prevented sore muscles when I packed my house belongings to move. I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease 8 years ago. This tape has helped  me continue to downhill ski, bike, and hike. The attention to details and following the moves greatly helps with my coordination and balance. I also used it when I injured my foot and when I had an operation on my foot. I bent my knee with the injured foot and placed it on pillows on the floor, low stool, or ottoman. This really helped me stay in shape even when I couldn't do much else. I have given the tape as a thank you gift to eight friends. I have bought five of her other tapes, but this one is still my favorite. She states upcoming moves very clearly so she is easy to follow.",1417910400,2,843,4.236024844720497

3044593,4,B000ZZT7BS,"A shortish workout, with concentration on stretches and repetitive movements for arms and legs. It certainly got to to those inner thighs and high back of thigh muscles-you could feel it the next day. Also helps balance, rhythm and well-being and over time, with regular use, will get you into shape.

3044594,5,B000ZZT7BS,"""Ellen Barrett Live"" and ""The Studio by Ellen Barrett"" series are a must buy for any fitness level! The barefoot ballet+pilates+yoga combination is an elegant yet intensive workout which leaves you feeling energized during & after the workout! NO MENTAL GYMNASTICS required! I loved the 45min ""Ellen Barrett Live Fusion Floor workout"" so much I purchased the entire ""The Studio by Ellen Barrett"" series. 45 minutes flies by seriously. I used to be hesistant about having time for 45 minute workouts but Ellen its goes by so fast I don't realize its been 45 minutes. I'm almost 49 & I get an intensive workout without feeling intense/burnout while I'm doing the workout. All the moves in Ellens DVDs are all different variations of moves you're familiar with if you workout with Ellen like I have for 12 yrs now, so its never, ever boring & I feel so graceful while I'm exercising. Highly recommend the ""Ellen Barrett Live"" and ""The Studio by Ellen Barrett"" series along with the ""Pick Your Level Weight Loss Pilates"" when you only have 30 minutes  : )",1398297600,,1051,4.774725274725275

3044596,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I am in my mid 40s and have always worked out.  As I am getting older I really wanted a workout that would
be a bit easier on my body and help me with the mind, body connection.  This is exactly what I've been looking
for.  No impact on the joints, awareness of the heart center is key and beautiful elongating moves that really work
the whole body.  Form is everything in this workout and you will not regret buying this one.  Truly one
of my favorite workouts ever!",1397174400,2,467,4.202247191011236
3044597,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I love all of Ellen Barrett's workouts.  She doesn't say cutesy things, she isn't overly enthusiastic like Denise Austin, and she focuses on form.  ""Never compromise your form for an exercise.""  The workouts are heavily influenced by ballet and Pilates and are very effective.  This one is my current favorite.",1396137600,,310,5.14
3044598,5,B000ZZT7BS,This might not seem like a workout but your are sweating and can certainly feel it when you are done. I like this because most of it is done standing up and I have two knee replacements and can't do a lot of jumping and running for cardio this fits the bill.,1395878400,,258,3.980769230769231

3044600,4,B000ZZT7BS,"Another one of Ellen's great DVDs.  She is inspirational and covers a lot of ground where you feel the burn, but you don't feel like your going to crash.  I have a small apt with wooden floors, so the moves are just right.",1393718400,,222,4.1395348837209305
3044601,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I love doing calisthenic workouts (no weights, just using your body) and this is a good one. It's got kind of an infusion of Pilates and ballet type moves, and I'd say it mainly targets the shoulders/arms and thighs/butt area. I was also surprised than unlike many other workout dvd's I own, she actually does the ENTIRE workout instead of breaking off to point out form or other things, and she does it while smiling and speaking clearly.",1393545600,,439,4.641025641025641

3044603,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is a great workout for toning and strengthening the whole body.  Ellen's cues are good, and the 40+ minutes gives you a complete workout without being totally exhausted.  So glad I bought it!",1389916800,,196,4.735294117647059
3044604,5,B000ZZT7BS,This workout is fun to do and you feel good during and after doing it. It works out your whole body and though it looks simple you will still feel sore the next day(especially in your legs.)  I alternate between this and the 30 Day Shred.,1386892800,,238,4.173913043478261

3044626,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I love this workout!  And Ellen Barrett is my favorite instructor.  You work every muscle grouping throughout the video.  Doing pilates on a regular basis, you will find, you have more strength, more poise, better posture and fabulous muscle tone.  You can't ask for a better exercise regimen nor a better instructor!  I have six of her videos and I doubt I'll ever follow anyone else!",1385164800,,385,4.7727272727272725
3044627,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is one of my favorite videos! I am 26 years old, a newly graduated physician, and I have played sports for over 15 years now. I have tried many workouts including in the gym and at home. I have lots of workout DVDs...some are great, some are okay, but it's nice to have a lot so that I can mix it up. If you do the same workout DVD every day you will get muscle memory and the workouts will get easier and eventually be less effective. I do this video quite frequently and have definitely seen results.

PROS:
-You don't need any weights - you use your own body weight. (Keep in mind that you really need to focus though when this is the case. It's up to you to keep your core/arms/legs tight while doing the exercises or it won't work as well.)
- You really don't even need a mat - I just do this on the carpet in my home
- It's gentle (no vigorous jumping) yet gets my heart racing (when done properly with focus)
- It's great for the legs especially
- Even though I'm 26 and pretty healthy, I would feel comfortable recommending this to older or overweight individuals. I have even recommend this to my mother, who is older and not in the best shape. It can be pretty gentle if you take it slowly and can be a great place to start. If you do exactly what she does, at her speed, and with proper form, it can be VERY tough and a great workout. It's what you want it to be!

CONS:
- You are basically in a squatting position almost the whole time. This is very hard on the legs at first if you're not used to it. Also, there's a ton of bending, so you need proper technique so as not to hurt your knees. Sometimes when I don't focus, I do the squats incorrectly and then get pretty bad knee pain and need to take a few days off. Just be mindful to avoid this and look up a youtube video of proper form for squats.
- It's pretty long - about 45 min. It starts out really slow. Sometimes I prefer a quick 20 min Jillian Michaels workout just to get it over with. But I will say, this video is kinda fun and relaxing in a weird way - it makes it go by faster.
- It's not as great for toning arms as it is for legs. I really believe weights are the way to go for the arms.

All in all - this WILL give you results. But, as with anything, there is no quick fix. You should buy a few other workout DVDs (don't buy her pilates one though....it's basically the exact same thing), but try others to mix it up a bit. Eat healthy too - that is a must. Hope this helps!",1384387200,8,2463,3.9918864097363085
3044628,5,B000ZZT7BS,Ellen Barrett is my favorite workout instructor. I have several of her dvds and love them all. Fat Burning Fusion is fantastic as well!,1384387200,,135,4.666666666666667
3044629,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is a great work out - I love everything I've tried of Ellen's.  She has made me into someone who works out everyday because I love how I feel - believe me - I have NEVER been into exercise (and I'm 38), but thank you Ellen Barrett for changing my outlook (and my body)!!  This one in particular, along with Super Fast and Sleek Sculpt have shown the most marked and rapid results.  I would highly recommend!!!!!!!",1380672000,3,418,4.333333333333333
3044630,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I bought this dvd, along with a selection of 5 or 6 others I had read about in a women's magazine as being the best rated workouts for women. I have to admit, although I am healthy, and exercise (usually) - I have not really used many of the workout DVDs I have bought in the past. That is not the case with this DVD! I love it, and of the others I bought at the same time, this is one of three that I use at least once a week. My coworkers and I started working out three or four months ago together on our lunch break in a basement room at work that is set aside for exercise (no frills, just a projector, etc - but we feel lucky to have a space to do our workouts). We all like this DVD - we had a few criteria: it had to be good exercise, we wanted to be able to vary the workout (depending on the time we had) between 30 to 45 minutes, we wanted a good workout but not so soaked in sweat that we couldn't return to work after changing out of our workout clothes, and most importantly was that the instructor not be annoying to listen to. The last criteria is because if you are going to use a DVD each week for many many months, you don't want to have to hear the same lame jokes or bouncy-bouncy-happy-happy chit chat. We find Ellen and her workout partners encouraging but not over the top, and find it rather invigorating and relaxing to workout. I will write a review for the other two DVDs we all love to use from the group too, but I think I am not supposed to mention other product names here.",1376006400,4,1505,4.003322259136213
3044631,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Like most of Ellen Barrett's workouts this one is deceptive in how much of a workout you get.  Though you never do anything super challenging, you can tell when you are finished that your whole body has had a workout.

Unlike a lot of exercise videos that build one big long routine that you have to keep going to the beginning of the routine every time a new step is added, Ellen builds about 4 routines.  You do each one all the way through on one side and then you repeat it on the other side.  I prefer this method than having to do the same routine over and over as you add steps.

This video has a lot of standing lower body work.  So that while you are toning your legs, you are also toning your torso as you work on your balance.  There is also just enough large range of motion exercises to keep you heart rate up there.  For me, this steady stream of moderate exertion is much more effective than a strenuous cardio workout.

One of my favorites!",1374624000,,956,4.208791208791209

I had never done any pilates or yoga - was not sure if it was for me but I really enjoy this workout.  I'm 52, not in terrible shape, but not in the shape I wish to be. This 'mind body fusion' concept has lots of stretching & that can only be a good thing!  There is no jumping around, all can be done in bare feet, no weights or equipment necessary.  Do not think it's a piece of cake though, I'm completey sweating by the middle of it and I mean wet hair & all.  Ellen and the two girls don't look even a bit hot, which bothered me a bit, but maybe if I continue to do this routine for months & months, I'll be able to look cool too??  I will continue to work out with Ellen and this dvd - very enjoyable.  A stress reliever.",1372636800,3,920,3.9405405405405407

I use it for stress relief after a long day of work or a horseback riding class.  It is definitely a good workout but not a serious challenge.",1371686400,3,393,4.077922077922078

After the 45min, you feel better and all the tensions of the day are gone. I even can't wait to do it after a long hard day at work, when i usually don't want to do anything.

I am 60 years old and have always done some mild yoga to keep my body flexible and my core strong. I've never been one to do weight lifting or serious cardio. Ellen's workouts keep me feeling great. I alternate between the three videos during the week (Mon, Wed, Fri)and do my treadmill in between for more cardio. Over the years, I've joined various exercise programs only to quit because of the inconvenience. With Ellen, I can do the routines right in my own home, first thing in the morning, then get on with my day. I have two other of her tapes, but prefer the three I mentioned. I believe these exercise programs will keep me feeling good and hopefully prevent some of the stiffness and lack of mobility that plagues many of us as we get older.

If you want something that tones, stretches, sculpts AND raises your heartrate, without causing a lot of stress and impact to the body, this is the DVD for you.  There are some days where I can't even get through the whole thing because it works you out so well.  You really need to pace yourself and not overdo it, as it can poop you out quickly and impact completing the workout.  Ellen is great, her cues are perfect, she is good about monitoring correct form amd posture, and she encourages you to go at your own pace and do what is best for you.

I sweat just as much as my Jillian work out's. Afterwards I feel great and my posture feels so much better too. The time flies by as well.

It flows very smoothly together and it really gets your heart rate up without feeling depleted.  And if you have ever purchased any of her other dvds, you know that Ellen makes the exercises fun.  She really has a calming, friendly voice.  There's no shouting or yelling to get more out of you.  And just so you don't think that I am some out-of-shape person, I am a marathon runner and I use her pilates and yoga videos to help me stretch and elongate my muscles.  I am definitely going to buy more.

3044662,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Ellen developed kind of a different ""concept"" for working out in her ""The Studio"" series; she calls it ""mind-body fusion"": a mix between pilates, yoga and dance. Basically it consists in working on two opposites: ""crunching"" and ""extending"". This way of exercising your muscles 2-ways makes a lot of sense to me and seems more natural. With Ellen you really ""exercise"" the stretch; it is not just stretching after your workout, it is part of your workout and you are meant to do it with the same intensity. I recently read that this is also healthier for your bones and articulations. You ""pull-in"" and then ""reach-out"" with equal intensity to have an ""organic flow"". I also think (I'm not sure) that you work more muscles and muscle-groups together. I have never done so many squats in my life; not because other workouts do not have that many, but because I never got through them. Why? Because Ellen calls them ""butterflies"". It's not just the name, it's that after the squat you draw an inverted heart with your arms and extend far up (like swimming), so this intentional movement gives your exercise kind of an ""organic flowing"" meaning and wholeness. The same happens with lunges, which become ""Tom Sawyer walks"".

Although this DVD has a workout format (a series of repetitions of the same exercise), it is not boring at all, maybe because Ellen puts two or three exercises into a combination. You do not need dancing skills either, since there is no real choreography like in aerobics. With this workout you will achieve a ""dancer's"" body, strong toned elongated muscles, not really like when you do weight lifting, but definitely toned and healthy. Your posture improves and you feel taller.

This is one of the few DVD's where I could observe immediate results, and when I say immediate, I mean as soon as you turn your DVD player off: you feel instantly energized. Ellen says it's because she includes exercises to open the chest to let more air in and she always emphasizes to ""present yourself"" like in ballet to open or lift your ""heart center"". There are only 2 other DVD's where I saw immediate results. Only by doing the step-by-sep instruction (not even the real 20 minute workout) of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Basic-3-DVD-Workout-Set-Basics-Step-By-Step-20-Minute-Workout-Accelerated-Body-Sculpting/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Basic 3 DVD Workout Set (Basics Step-By-Step/20 Minute Workout/Accelerated Body Sculpting)</a>&nbsp;my back felt right where it should be and I slept like a baby (better than with yoga). However, the Winsor Pilates is boring to such an extent that I have only done it twice, even though I really think it helps. The yoga session of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Belly-Dance-with-Rachel-Brice-Bellydance-Technique-Yoga-for-Strong-Relaxed-Sinuous-Movement/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement</a>&nbsp;is easy to do and shorter than almost anything I have tried, with immediate results for your back and hips by releasing the muscles in theses areas.

SAFETY
Take a bit of care with your knees in some of the exercises (I have an injury, and in this DVD there are some specific exercises that I put special care how I place myself).

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Very good CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Very Good FUN FACTOR: Very good

CONTENTS:
Warm-up, 5 segments of exercises and cool down

MUSIC:
Soft instrumental music, normally I would not play this music, but it goes very well with the workout and it also makes you feel relaxed and ""lifted"".

EMPHASIS:
Very good overall emphasis, cardio, strength, stretch as Ellen calls it. You tone legs, arms, shoulders, abs (core) and incredibly even spine (twists) and feet... It also includes several balance and flexibility exercises, which I always find very good and you also have some cardio. The DVD is best performed barefoot (I use a mat, this is basically the space you need) and all exercises are performed standing.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ FUN: This DVD is one of my favorites, you feel great when exercising plus it is fun.
+ Excellent overall emphasis: This workout tones areas other workouts don't, e.g. your feet
+ Pilates technique made fun: It has the benefits of pure pilates but it is much more fun and includes cardio
+ Simplicity: It can be done by almost anybody, since the exercises are fairly easy.
+ ""Mind-body fusion"" principle: This might sound a bit ""new agey"" (not really my stuff), but I have to admit it is true, after exercising this way I feel lifted, energized, accepting and in peace with myself.",1342224000,6,4852,5.375
3044663,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I love Ellen's workouts,and have had this one for a few years. I used it a lot, then it moved out of my regular rotation and sat around a while... but I recently rediscovered it and have to say it's the best postnatal workout (though not billed as such) It has everything the new mama needs- stretching and toning and twisting to get your back feeling a bit less hunched (all that nursing can really do a number on your back) and afterwards you feel worked out all over. My favorite thing is that there is almost no floor time (with a little baby I don't have time to vacuum the floor and workout, so I definitely don't want to lie on my floor!) I regularly do a pretty tough boot camp workout and so I'm in reasonable shape, but this got me nice and sweaty and I feel sore in the right places afterward.

I have been exercising to Turbo Jam and Joyce Vedral but I was finding that I wasn't feeling anything but tired after the workouts.  Surprisingly I felt muscle ache the next day and that I had really had a great workout.  I love the flow and elegance plus the fact that they are barefoot.  The music I loved as it seemed quite soothing and different to anything I had worked out to before.  I really worked up a sweat and was drenched so don't be fooled into thinking this is easy for those off days when you don't want to work too hard.  Ont the other hand this is not going to kill you and you will be able to go about your day without feeling worn out like I do with turbo jam and turbo fire.  I have been working out since I was a teenager continually so I am in very good shape and have kept off the middle age weight gain because of this and happy to say that ellen Barratt is just great and will add a new dimension to your repetoire.  A much kinder gentler dimension.  Ellen has a great personality and is easy to listen to.  I highly recommend!,1329609600,2,1182,4.056034482758621

It's not super high impact, but it does have sufficient intensity and length that it's not a strictly ""light"" work-out video.
Highly recommended",1328400000,3,417,4.533333333333333
3044686,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I really love Ellen Barrett's workouts, for many of the reasons others have already pointed out. This workout works your whole body in a way that is invigorating, not exhausting. It's great for any time! If you're someone who wants a ""no pain no gain"" type of hardcore approach, this may not appeal to you unless you're up for an easy day or if you're pregnant, for example. (In my opinion, this workout is perfect for any stage of pregnancy -- there are no flat on the back floor exercises, no bouncing, and your heart rate gets up, but not out of control.) But if you're ready for a mind-body approach to low-impact barefoot cardio, this is for you.

In short, I feel recharged after this video: strengthened, stretched, revitalized. 5 invigorating stars!

P.S.: I almost forgot to mention: All of Ellen's workouts are extremely easy to follow. No sudden changes or difficult to follow moves. That's extremely important for someone who's choreography-challenged like me!",1320537600,3,972,4.884848484848485

For anyone who likes to get a really good workout and wants to feel great and energized afterwards, this workout will be perfect.  I started with Ellen Barrett in 2006 and come back to her every time.  I have tried others, but they don't work near as well for me.  I get a wonderful workout, get toned and feel great.

I absolutely love Ellen Barrett and I love this DVD.  As she says in the video, the workout is deceptive.  It feels wonderful.  Your heart rate goes up, your muscles engage, and it feels GOOD. I use this workout the day after I have used weights or done serious ab work.  This one keeps me in the fat burning range while I tone and stretch the muscles I worked to failure the day before.  I really believe that using this video and her other Studio videos helps me to maintain my balance and flexibilty, and the ability of all of my muscles to work together.
I wish I could workout in Ellen's studio.  She is a fantastic instructor, giving the prompts I need to maintain correct form.  She is supportive and encouraging, but not ""cheesy"" or too chatty.  The routine in this video is carefully choreographed and each movement transitions seemlessly to the next.",1302912000,3,1109,4.477611940298507

Also a good ""in-between workouts stretch"" for high impact lovers. Ellen's voice is soothing but upbeat and inspiring. No cutsie cheerleading pump up here! You do get your heart rate up but it's definitely not as strenuous as high impact aerobics. It's ballet, pilates combined which is great for your back and muscles. I didn't think I'd like the barefooted idea but that's turned out to be a wonderful asset! I will buy more of Ellen Barrett's workouts.",1295654400,4,584,4.85

Ellen stresses that you should focus on form and, if you do that, this is a challenging workout with cardio, toning and stretch.  This is a good low impact workout.  I don't like jumping around and feeling like I can't follow complicated choreography.  Ellen's moves are fluid and relatively easy to follow.  She explains that her exercises complement the feminine form and that you don't need heavy weights to get a strength workout--you can use the weight of your own body.  This is challenging workout that energizes and relaxes.",1284681600,8,706,4.691056910569106
3044697,4,B000ZZT7BS,"Well, for starters, the IDEA of the low-impact standing Pilates workout is what grabbed my attention. Before purchasing this DVD, I enjoyed working out to Leslie Sansone in-home walking workout DVDs (I still do, just not as often), and I wasn't at all familiar with or even aware of Ellen. However, since I live on the 8th floor, I felt the need to find a workout that would be powerful and help me to sculpt a lean, graceful body without making stomping noises, for the sake of the poor tenants living on the 7th floor. Since I rarely have the patience to do exercises on the mat, I thought I hit gold here when I found this title online. This was it--the low-impact STANDING PILATES WORKOUT! I thought it'd be a piece of cake. Something to do casually, whenever I could spare the time, before going to work in the morning. A breeze. Boy was I wrong. This NEVER FAILS to break me into a sweat. Not just a little dampness, either, it's dripping sweat that I refer to. It's summer right now and of course the hot weather is probably making me sweat by default, but this is a TOUGH workout. It's certainly not for ""sissies."" Form is so so SO important. Each time I do it, I appreciate it even more. I feel that my arms are becoming more lean, and I can see that this is having positive effects on my entire body. At first the plie squats were seriously getting on my nerves and annoying the heck out of my knees, but the more I do them the easier they get, and the more capable I become of doing them. Not to say that this is a perfect DVD--for instance, I wish Ellen would give more specific instruction on HOW to do certain moves instead of constantly repeating to ""stand up tall"" and ""lift the heart."" Overall, I think this is a great workout for those who are looking to tone and sculpt and stretch their bodies. It will certainly break a sweat, but not in the way you may be used to. If you're looking to breeze through your workout and not think too much (and I certainly enjoy these types of workouts as well), this probably isn't for you. For those types of workouts, I recommend Leslie Sansone DVDs or just plain running.",1282521600,23,2128,4.335839598997493

After previewing both this and barefoot cardio, I picked fbf. I previewed, and then about-regretably-a month later, I actually started doing it. Some have had complaints about the cuing, on the contrary, I thought she had excellent cuing in comparison to ybb, hemalyaa, and the skinny b! tch series. She was easy to follow, the work out itself was pretty fluid, and it made me feel graceful. It was easy enough to do it while the video was going, then the next day, I could feel it in my core and 'back fat' region. I'm usually pretty uninspired, because I have a good metabolism-dont hate me!-and don't have to exercise, but I know its good for my mind and body. With this dvd I really felt the connection. With ybb, I felt like a jackass doing the moves. I cannot sexy dance or 'work it' or 'shake it' or any other idioms they tried to tell me to get me moving my groove thing. My things don't grove that way. haha. The fluid ballet/pilates motion this has suits me better. Over all I very much enjoyed it. I didn't notice the music, and I thought that the production was pretty good, also people have said the other two girls weren't very good. I thought they were good additions, to make people who are new or slightly out of shape to feel more comfortable doing the work out. Excercise dvds aren't just for skinny, toned people, you guys.

Which is a shame since the exercise regime could be a good one if you could get past the droning soundtrack, intermittently audible cues, and vertiginous cinematography.

Great for keeping my abs flat and muscular, but still feminine. I have MS, so I wanted a fitness video that could keep me fit without an intensive workout... and her videos are perfect! I mostly use her videos as a supplementation to walking, biking and using the elliptical trainer.

I think Ellen appeals to so many people because her workouts can be done at all levels and she always offers a modification.  Regarding some of the reviews that criticize the lack of cardio, I think we need to be realistic about what this dvd really is.  I do this work out in the mornings (and switch off with her other videos) before work and it's just the right amount of movement to get my blood flowing and get me stretched out for the day.  As well, the breathing and the flow of the movements help clear the mind and get you focused.  I do alternate cario workouts (running) and stregnth training dvds throughout the week and find this to be a good supplement to Ellen's workouts.  I look forward to her workouts, whereas I may not be super excited to run or lift weights.  If you stick with her workouts, you will see results.  The tops of and the inner parts of my legs are firmer than they have ever been as just a runner.  You will get that long and lean look with her videos and for those of you that miss the weights, the sweat and the cardio, try the series she did with Self magazine and use a five pound set.

The only negative aspects of the video is the music and the set.  I love Ellen's Self Bikini ready fast video with the beach background. There is a theme throughout all of her videos and I always finish feeling strong, relaxed and energized all at once.  I also love that her movements are complementary to the female body, creating long lean muscles instead of building bulk.  As others mentioned Ellen is upbeat without being annoying.  I'm canceling my gym membership and using these videos combined with long hikes and tennis.  I also have the Slim Sculpt video from this series and I have only used it once but though it was pretty good.",1263168000,,955,4.442528735632184

Ellen has an upbeat, smooth voice and she easily transitions her students from movement to movement. Very effective!",1260662400,4,413,4.830985915492958

3044710,3,B000ZZT7BS,"While there is no doubt that Ellen is a talented teacher, I found this particular video to be uninspiring and ache-inducing. I would not recommend this video for anyone who has knee problems due to the high repetition of plies. I would recommend Melissa Lowe's Ballet Workout for a ballet class workout. I found my knees didn't bother me while doing the Ballet Workout as long as I modified the grand plies to plies. For all-around fun DVDs that include jazz, ballet, modern dance yoga, Bollywood, burlesque and Latin dancing, I recommend the Yoga Booty Ballet series. The teachers can be a little over-the-top on the metaphysical comments sometimes, but I always have fun working out with them. Good music, fun moves, beautiful scenery, great results.",1256169600,5,752,4.976190476190476

Sore tush, and inner thighs especially. Made me sweat heavily, and I'm in decent shape. It's pretty much no-impact, good if you have a sensitive knee. It has no floor work for abs, which may be a pro or a con depending on your point of view. The arm work is pretty light. This is a good overall routine to intersperse with other targeted workouts. I'm pleased with it and may order more from this series.",1245110400,6,562,4.3619047619047615

In it, Ellen introduces her signature moves: butterfly, second position plies, skater, happy feet and more. No equipment is necessary, and best of all, shoes aren't required either! This workout is very flowing and graceful; it's constant movement and would be good for high beginner/low intermediate. The work continues right up to the end, as I don't know anyone but Ellen who has you do eight plank pushups during a cool down!

Ellen Barrett's focus aside from giving you a great workout is also that you feel good during and after the workout.  Another thing I like about Ellen Barrett is that she is always focused on getting you a longer leaner shape and avoiding bulk.  I am definitely seeing a difference especially in my legs/thighs.",1240963200,6,489,4.662790697674419

I exercise for many years, but I never did gymnastics or any serious sports, so I can say that I still amateur.  I discovered Ellen Barrett DVDs just recently.  Before that I worked with Denise Austin and Karen Vought and loved several of their workouts, but I needed something new.  So I searched Amazon, read peoples reviews, watched samples on YouTube.  I decided to try Ellen Barrett new Studio workout because I liked music in the sample. (I have all three DVDs; my favorite is ""The Studio - Fat burning fusion"").  I was rewarded.

Ellen Barrett has excellent personality, her voice is very pleasant to hear, all moves are flows from one to another one, and, after workout is complete, I feel great.  Excellent music helps not just to do exercises, but also to ease your mind; it makes me smile and feel like I perform, not just doing exercise.

Please do not pay attention that someone said it's boring.  It's not.  Ellen Barrett put good number of repetitions, but in order to achieve result you need to do 8 - 16 times the same move, not just jump from one move to another one; also to master a proper form you need to do the same move over and over again.  But even for the same leg or hand Ellen provides variety of exercises and a set does not goes for more than 5 minutes. (Set is several different exercises for the same hand or leg).  The beauty of them is that they done in some special order which make your heart elevated (without jumping Jacks), and at the same time your muscles straightened or stretched.

I like when she says ""elegant arms"", ""happy feet"" or ""whatever you're best, it's perfect"" or ""good work everybody"".  These simple words make me feel as part of the group.  And if to summarize the experience in just one sentence:  It's not a workout, it's like a performance that you can do each single day and have a pleasure doing it.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone who wants to feel young, a little bit artistic, and just happy.

Thank you to everyone who wrote reviews before me.  You helped me to find a new perfect trainer.",1234742400,29,2218,4.771653543307087
3044720,4,B000ZZT7BS,"This is not as sleepy as a typical pilates workout, but you won't get cardio benefits from it. My heartrate is around 40-50% of maximum - better than traditional pilates, but not great. The routines are interesting ballet/pilates stretching - no weights involved. The sides of my thighs usually ache the next day. I like the instructor - very calm and upbeat.",1234742400,,359,4.806451612903226
3044721,4,B000ZZT7BS,"Although the package for this workout bills it as ""liquid barefoot cardio"" (who could resist trying that??) it's not much of a cardio routine, as it barely got my heartrate elevated. But... I'd still give it four stars, as this is a wonderful routine for stretching and lengthening muscles and relieving stress. I love doing these movements, and use the workout on lighter days to stretch out and reduce stress. I find that I really look forward to this workout, especially after a few harder days of working out. There are also some great lower body exercises toward the end of the routine.",1233619200,2,591,4.747572815533981
3044722,5,B000ZZT7BS,"WOW WOW WOW! Is all I can think of saying. I am very impressed by Ellen's Fat Burning Fusion DVD.
As a new Mommy of an 8 month old baby, this workout allows me to burn fat thru aerobics. HOWEVER, unlike any other workout video I have ever done, at the same time, it releases my stress and makes my muscles feel great. I'll attribute this to the perfect pace/tempo of the music and workout as well as all the amazing message like stretches that heal my body after  a day of lifting and lugging my baby everywhere!

As a professional singer/songwriter, I need to keep in tip top shape so I can be strong to travel and stand for long performances. II have added this workout as well as Fahtiems' Belly Dance Boot Camp Volume 2 and walking to my weekly workout agenda. Counting carbs and monitoring them is also part of my plan. I have lost a few inches in 2 weeks and have lost 5 pounds.

THANK YOU ELLEN!!!

3044723,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This workout is deceptive. Done properly you will sweat and your muscles will feel the effects afterwards. This is a thorough workout--all muscles are worked with a very good cardiovascular component. One word of caution, if you are at all uncoordinated there are some moves toward the end of the workout that require some thought and probably should be practiced in isolation. However,this is a workout that leaves you feeling energized and invigorated. I like the fact you don't need shoes but you should have a yoga or pilates mat. Ellen is inspiring and lively without being annoying and the music is also motivating. I particularly like it as I work out very early in the morning and don't always enjoy a lot of hyperactivity and noise.",1232409600,4,741,4.84251968503937
3044724,2,B000ZZT7BS,"While this is gentle on the body if you have back/knee issues, it's BORING and repetitious. It drove me crazy.

Just when you think, thank GOD this is almost done, you realize you still have the OTHER side of your body to work out.  After a half an hour, frankly, I was done! Not physically, but mentally.

I did feel the burn the next day and it honestly helped my torn rotator cuff, BUT the thought of doing it again left little to be desired. I like to either work both sides of my body one after the other or at the same time.  I think it's just a mental thing, but it makes the time seem to go by faster.

If you don't mind this, this is a great workout; if you DO mind it, keep looking for others out there that offer great benefits without the mental strain (i.e. Leslie Sansone, my fave)!",1228089600,14,796,4.109677419354838

3044727,5,B000ZZT7BS,I have purchased four of Ellen Barrett's fitness DVDs--from Cruch to Studio and she never disappoints.

3044728,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is my favorite exercise dvd.  I would consider this an intermediate workout.  The workout is approximately 45 minutes and during that time you are getting a lot of aerobics and toning exercises.  I usually try to do this workout at least twice a week and it really has made my legs more shapely.

Towards the end of the workout, before the cool down, there are great exercises for your arms, plus leg toning exercises.  This dvd is a total body workout that will tone your muscles.  I really like the spine twist exercises since sometimes I have problems with my back.  Ellen says that spine twists are very healthy for the back.  This is a fantastic dvd to get your body in better shape.",1221436800,4,693,4.488
3044729,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is a great workout. Ellen's cues are easy to follow the very first time you do the workout, and it gets better each time you do it. You get everything, cardio, abs, stretch.",1221350400,3,178,4.264705882352941
3044730,4,B000ZZT7BS,"This is a great workout because it really revs up the circulation without putting any stress on the joints.  I'm not young, and so I can't step or jump or do anything that might endanger my well-being.  That said, I'm not old either.  So, this workout is invigorating without being stressful or painful.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is Ellen tends to work one side then the other rather than alternating and I don't enjoy that as much as I might.  Anyway, it's a really good low impact workout with pleasant music and a ""community center"" atmosphere.  I wish she would produce a lot more - I would buy them all.  (Maybe after I've done this several times, I'll change my mind and call it a 5).",1220745600,3,714,4.363636363636363
3044731,3,B000ZZT7BS,"I am a huge fan of Ellen Barrett.  I fully expected to love this DVD.  I did not.  I have several of her other workouts-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Fat-Burning-Pilates/dp/B00009V7QF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Fat Burning Pilates</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Super-SlimDown-Pilates-Yoga-Blend/dp/B000CEXF8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blend</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Burn-Firm-Pilates/dp/B00020HCC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates</a>.  While doing this workout, I kept thinking how much Fat Burning Fusion felt like Burn & Firm Pilates without the weights.  BUT, Burn & Firm Pilates is a much more superior workout because there are some challenging parts to it and it moves a lot faster.  Fat Burning Fusion moved way too slowly and the moves were uninteresting and repetitive.  It barely got my heart rate up and I couldn't wait for it to be over.",1220486400,6,1091,7.611111111111111
3044732,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Ellen Barrett has her own style of workout she's developed specifically for women. Her goal is to combine cardio, toning and stretching together simultaneously instead of doing them separately, and she does this by a ""fusion"" of workout elements taken from pilates, yoga, dance/ballet, sports fitness and more traditional calisthenics and aerobics. Plus she aspires to arrange these elements into a flowing, low-stress, low-impact yet cardio-, musclar- and stretching-intense workout that is complimentary to the female body. Sounds like a Herculean task, doesn't it? Well, thankfully Barrett's been at this for quite awhile - she is a former tennis pro who got into aerobics and fitness in the 80's - and so really knows what she's doing. As result she's succeeded in making a very efficient, effective and comfortable workout style that works your entire body. Barrett's approach is so efficient and comfortable that you'll probably not even realize how much of a workout this is until you've done it a few times and become more aware of how this makes your body work. As for effective - when I started doing Barrett's FitTV workouts, I noticed improvement in stamina, strength, flexibility and body tone with a couple weeks, when I discovered how much easier housecleaning and daily tasks had become, that my jeans were bit looser around the waist and how my thigh and bicep muscles were little more defined.

This particular workout on this DVD is mostly standing, with only a bare minimal of matwork. Count that as a major positive - standing exercises are not only helpful with improving your heart strength and blood flow to your extremities, the simple act of bearing you own weight during exercise improves your bone density and prevents bone loss, particularly in the spine and hips - the bones often most affected by osteopenia and osteoporosis. Plus, I personally like that you can do this workout barefoot. My feet really appreciate any opportunity to exercise without socks, shoes and all that sweat. While Barrett doesn't use weights in this workout, I suppose one could use 1-2 lb ankle and wrist weights of the workout. But I find this workout sufficiently intense enough without any added weights. While many exercises are similar to what you'll find in her ""Pilates Sculpt"" and ""Slo-robics"" workouts on FitTV's Allstar Workouts, they are done in a very different order and with additional exercises not seen on the FitTV workouts. Also, Barrett goes a little more indepth with the technique, form and logic of the exercises. This is overall a more challenging and intense workout, partly because you don't get commercial breaks and partly because, since there's no breaks, Barrett gets into more diverse series that really make your muscles work and stretch. I was doing her FitTV workouts 3-5 times a week for several weeks now before I got this DVD, and I still work up quite a good sweat with this one. In fact the first few times, I had to modify some of the exercise or take a break when my arms or thighs were getting a little too tired.

There's is quite a bit of plis and other knee-bending work, but I found the entire workout very agreeable for my 30-something knees. Like her FitTV workout, Barrett's flowing, low-impact combos are not only easy on the knees, but can safely strengthen and flex the knee region, which can potentially alleviate some types of knee pain. If you're still worried about knee strain, these exercise are quite doable if you need to wear a knee brace or patella band, or one could easily change the width of stance of the range of motion to make it easier on problem knees. This workout is also very good for problem ankles and feet, as a lot of these exercises strengthen and flex those areas as well.

Another plus about this workout is, again like her FitTV workouts , this is a phenomenal workout for the back and spine. Got lower back pain? Is your back often stiff, tired and achy? Want better posture? Give this workout a try. Barrett puts special attention to strengthening and flexing the back safely and effectively with a variety of twists, bends and stretches spread throughout the workout. Thanks to her ""fusion"" approach, these exercise are also very beneficial for your other core muscles. I have found these exercises so helpful in alleviating back pain and stiffness that I'll do a few of them whenever my back's giving me trouble - it works better than pain pills or a heating pain!

Lastly, this is a very feminine and stressing-relieving workout. Because most the exercises are simultaneously working one muscles group while stretching another, you'll likely feel little in the way of cramping or soreness, and it give your body a diverse range of motion to release any tension. Also a lot of these movements are very flattering to the female form, improving your muscle tone and posture for more feminine body shape. In additional to improving your tone and posture, Barrett's employs a ""mind-body"" approach that helps you mentally connect with your body and how it moves. This really improves gracefulness, body awareness and overall poise as well as allows you to better relax and rechannel stress into constructive energy.",1220400000,42,5202,4.914675767918089
3044733,4,B000ZZT7BS,"I love Ellen Barrett, but this workout is so different than the others I have done of hers, and is much more low impact and slow moving.  I did find myself sweating a lot and sore the next day, so it does work, but I prefer the more aerobic workouts myself.

Her cueing is right on the money so you always know what's coming up next.  And I felt just the right amount of tiredness in my body after doing this workout.  It's such a nice way to work out and to break a sweat.  There are quite a few parts where she does faster moves like ""skater"" and it's just great.  Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys new ways to workout while using basic dance/pilates moves.",1211932800,2,576,4.238532110091743
3044736,3,B000ZZT7BS,"I am a veteran of Cathe Freiderich and P90X workouts.  This workout delivers a less intense, but certainly not effortless exercise.  It was about two-thirds of the way through when the perspiration started to turn into real sweat, but unfortunately the intensity didn't last long.  I liked the the gracefulness and elegance of the moves - something you don't get a lot of in Cathe workouts or P90X workouts.

Ellen Barrett is an encouraging and positive instructor.  Her voice is pleasant to listen to and her smile is mega-wattage!

In the section entitled ""Welcome to the Studio"", I got the sense that there was not an outright 'anti-weights' vibe but instead a 'you don't need to lift heavy weights' vibe, which I thought was unfortunate.  Women should be lifting weights - and heavy ones too, to optimize the benefits to not just their muscles but their bones, especially.

A great workout for an 'easy day'.  Very recommended!",1211068800,4,931,4.8789808917197455

If you want to tone your arms, tone your quads and get a really good sweat going all to a very nice, modern, musical background, this is the DVD for you.

This is a well-paced workout, with good music and interesting, fluid moves. I worked up a nice sweat, but it wasn't too strenuous compared to her ""Crunch"" DVDs. The only downside is that there isn't a great deal of cardio here, I rarely got my pulse up over 140. All in all, a great addition to my exercize routine!",1207699200,2,454,4.416666666666667

I have been away from consistent exercise for quite a while.  This has given me a fun, but, challenging new workout -- the movements are smooth and good for my body.

The music is enjoyable and you can follow the temple easily; the movement is natural while challenging enough you'll feel it after you're done.  Also, the length of the workout fits my everyday schedule perfectly- I don't need to find anything else to do after this DVD because I'll get everything I needed within the 45 minutes workout.

A wonderful complement to weight routines-- lots of nice lengthening moves. It's clear that a lot of thought and preparation went into the design of the routine. And Ellen has got to be the least irritating video trainer I have experienced in a long time. The cueing is excellent. I could not be more enthusiastic. I immediately bought several more of her videos and am eagerly awaiting delivery.",1204588800,8,638,4.654867256637168
3044743,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I am a big fan of Ellen Barrett's, and have been for a couple of years. My favorite routine of her's, up to now, was the one she created for FitTV's ""All Star Workouts"" called Zen Sculpt. My next favorite, also from ""All Star Workouts"" was her Slow-robics. This new DVD, ""Fat Burning Fusion"" is from Ellen's Buff Girl Fitness productions, and does not disappoint!  It is a great workout from start to finish, and is very challenging and tough if done correctly.  You will get out of it what you put in to it.  Her focus is not always on what is moving, but what isn't moving.

A little note about Ellen's style...she isn't for those who want a bulky physique. She is more about elongating and strengthening the muscles for a lean and feminine dancer's body. Her routines blend Plilates with dance, with mind/body integration. The entire program works all areas of the body--the powerhouse, the heart center, and the limbs. So, you burn calories, build muscle, and stretch through each move smoothly and gracefully. You will feel this the next day--especially in the legs and glutes.

Working out with Ellen is not easy, but it is gentle to the body. If you want hard-core cardio, with lots of jumping around and kick-boxing, she's not for you. If you want to look like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen won't get you there. However, if you want to be toned, flexible, long and lean, she's your gal. Done on a regular basis, you will see results. This is Ellen at her very best-great cuing, easy explanations, and fun!",1204070400,162,1506,4.6254681647940075
3044744,4,B000ZZT7BS,"This DVD is 46 minutes of standing work only that blends pilates, ballet, and cardio together for a complete workout session. Ellen has a very soothing, non-aggravating voice and she gives clear instructions and time to prepare for the next movement. I like her casual reminders to breathe and how relaxing all of the movements seem. She won't have you jumping around and exercising 'hard' but you'll still get a great workout and have increased energy when you're done. There are a few issues with the DVD - first, the music. Unless you like jazz/Santana then you might not like the music playing along with the moves; there is no way to turn it off, so you have to just get used to it. Second, the length of the DVD is 46 minutes and it runs as a continuous workout, so you cannot break it down or select portions at will - you either play it all or cut it off when you get tired. Third, if you have Fit TV on cable - don't buy this DVD - Ellen is much better on Fit TV's Slowrobics than on this DVD, and the moves are almost identical. Plus, on the Fit TV Slowrobics show you get leg/floorwork that you won't get here. This Fusion DVD is just an expanded version of the Fit TV show, so just tape those and you have the same thing, with the added benefit of better music and better, more colorful outfits to look at.",1203552000,15,1318,4.276
3279062,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I enjoy this workout more each time I do it.  It features a great combination of strength, flexibility, and cardio if you really put in the effort.
I also like that it's a barefoot, low impact workout.  No special equipment needed.
Ellen is a master at easing you into some high intensity moves and then backing off just in time.  I also like how she lets the music set the rhythm in all of her dvd's.

This workout is Pilates/ballet/balance and the like.  It's a relaxing workout and while it's not cardio, your heart can be elevated if you find the moves a bit challenging.  I love the mermaid movements and the dancer plies.  It may look easy but while doing it, it's a good challenge and you can feel it the next day for sure.  It's not an intimidating workout if you aren't familiar with the moves - just watch the dvd through once or twice before trying it out.
It's about 45 minutes all up and it works you out really well.  I like this a lot and I'm going to try doing it 3 times a week along with plenty of cardio.",1197676800,15,879,4.190476190476191

Recently re-injured same leg and rushed to pull all my low impact/less strenuous workout DVDs.  Don't get me wrong--this video is absolutely challenging and I am always sweating at the finish.  (I am a regular, intermediate level exerciser.)  It puts minimal strain on the joints and I am able to do this workout currently with a sprained foot, with minor modifications.  Incorporates Pilates and some calisthenics and some ballet moves.  Geared towards women but don't be fooled--if you are a guy, you will get a good cardio workout, although most guys will find this workout a little too ""gay"".

3279068,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Your Review:
I am not an Ellen groupie, but I am a fan. I've tried most of her workouts and kept the ones I really like - of which, this is one. And, it's one that I won't get rid of.

It is a fusion workout that includes several sets of flowing moves that lead into each other. The moves include standing pilates, abs, cardio, and other fusion-y moves. Ellen leads in a big open studio area with hardwood floor and good music and two background exercisers, one who shows easier modifications. You can play all or choose a chapter (but, I don't do this workout often enough to know the segments before I do them.)

Ellen does a wonderful job in this workout. The workout seems to fly by as the moves flow. She does several segments of combinations of moves. If the moves are done on one side, then she repeats them on the other side. If not, then you do them once. I get a cardio effect from this workout as it flows along. She does a really good job of providing form pointers on the technical side while highlighting the joy and peace that can be found in moving your body and inhabiting a good space in your head.

I've seen people say that the more they do it that the harder it becomes because they focus on form more and more. I have no problem believing it. However, as I do this workout periodically on a ""tired day"", I find it to be a high beginner to intermediate workout.

Instructor Comments:
She brings the joy of movement to this workout along with great cueing and instruction.",1436227200,5,1492,4.298932384341637
3279069,4,B000ZZT7BS,I hurt my knee and have to avoid high impact exercise for the time being so I bought this DVD. The time moves quickly so that is a plus but it is somehow overall slow paced. I did break a light sweat which was nice but I imagine I will quickly become bored which is too bad because I really liked Ellen Barrett's older workouts. Ellen provides great cuing and has modifications for beginners available. Overall it is relaxing as well which is nice and really focuses on alignment.,1432771200,,480,4.404494382022472

I was not going to buy anymore because when I previewed some of the other DVDs on Collage Video, I felt that they all seemed similar. I recently joined an Ellen Barrett Group on Facebook and the group members highly recommended this DVD. I have to admit that they were spot on. This was challenging in a good way. I worked out parts of my body that I normally don't feel the burn in afterwards. My hamstrings and back felt like they both got a good workout. I was tingly and sore in a good way.

The stretching, etc prevented sore muscles when I packed my house belongings to move. I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease 8 years ago. This tape has helped  me continue to downhill ski, bike, and hike. The attention to details and following the moves greatly helps with my coordination and balance. I also used it when I injured my foot and when I had an operation on my foot. I bent my knee with the injured foot and placed it on pillows on the floor, low stool, or ottoman. This really helped me stay in shape even when I couldn't do much else. I have given the tape as a thank you gift to eight friends. I have bought five of her other tapes, but this one is still my favorite. She states upcoming moves very clearly so she is easy to follow.",1417910400,2,843,4.236024844720497

I loved the 45min ""Ellen Barrett Live Fusion Floor workout"" so much I purchased the entire ""The Studio by Ellen Barrett"" series. 45 minutes flies by seriously. I used to be hesistant about having time for 45 minute workouts but Ellen its goes by so fast I don't realize its been 45 minutes. I'm almost 49 & I get an intensive workout without feeling intense/burnout while I'm doing the workout. All the moves in Ellens DVDs are all different variations of moves you're familiar with if you workout with Ellen like I have for 12 yrs now, so its never, ever boring & I feel so graceful while I'm exercising.

I have six of her videos and I doubt I'll ever follow anyone else!",1385164800,,385,4.7727272727272725
3279124,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is one of my favorite videos! I am 26 years old, a newly graduated physician, and I have played sports for over 15 years now. I have tried many workouts including in the gym and at home. I have lots of workout DVDs...some are great, some are okay, but it's nice to have a lot so that I can mix it up. If you do the same workout DVD every day you will get muscle memory and the workouts will get easier and eventually be less effective. I do this video quite frequently and have definitely seen results.

PROS:
-You don't need any weights - you use your own body weight. (Keep in mind that you really need to focus though when this is the case. It's up to you to keep your core/arms/legs tight while doing the exercises or it won't work as well.)
- You really don't even need a mat - I just do this on the carpet in my home
- It's gentle (no vigorous jumping) yet gets my heart racing (when done properly with focus)
- It's great for the legs especially
- Even though I'm 26 and pretty healthy, I would feel comfortable recommending this to older or overweight individuals. I have even recommend this to my mother, who is older and not in the best shape. It can be pretty gentle if you take it slowly and can be a great place to start. If you do exactly what she does, at her speed, and with proper form, it can be VERY tough and a great workout. It's what you want it to be!

CONS:
- You are basically in a squatting position almost the whole time. This is very hard on the legs at first if you're not used to it. Also, there's a ton of bending, so you need proper technique so as not to hurt your knees. Sometimes when I don't focus, I do the squats incorrectly and then get pretty bad knee pain and need to take a few days off. Just be mindful to avoid this and look up a youtube video of proper form for squats.
- It's pretty long - about 45 min. It starts out really slow. Sometimes I prefer a quick 20 min Jillian Michaels workout just to get it over with. But I will say, this video is kinda fun and relaxing in a weird way - it makes it go by faster.
- It's not as great for toning arms as it is for legs. I really believe weights are the way to go for the arms.

All in all - this WILL give you results. But, as with anything, there is no quick fix. You should buy a few other workout DVDs (don't buy her pilates one though....it's basically the exact same thing), but try others to mix it up a bit. Eat healthy too - that is a must. Hope this helps!",1384387200,8,2463,3.9918864097363085

3279127,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I bought this dvd, along with a selection of 5 or 6 others I had read about in a women's magazine as being the best rated workouts for women. I have to admit, although I am healthy, and exercise (usually) - I have not really used many of the workout DVDs I have bought in the past. That is not the case with this DVD! I love it, and of the others I bought at the same time, this is one of three that I use at least once a week. My coworkers and I started working out three or four months ago together on our lunch break in a basement room at work that is set aside for exercise (no frills, just a projector, etc - but we feel lucky to have a space to do our workouts). We all like this DVD - we had a few criteria: it had to be good exercise, we wanted to be able to vary the workout (depending on the time we had) between 30 to 45 minutes, we wanted a good workout but not so soaked in sweat that we couldn't return to work after changing out of our workout clothes, and most importantly was that the instructor not be annoying to listen to. The last criteria is because if you are going to use a DVD each week for many many months, you don't want to have to hear the same lame jokes or bouncy-bouncy-happy-happy chit chat. We find Ellen and her workout partners encouraging but not over the top, and find it rather invigorating and relaxing to workout. I will write a review for the other two DVDs we all love to use from the group too, but I think I am not supposed to mention other product names here.",1376006400,4,1505,4.003322259136213
3279128,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Like most of Ellen Barrett's workouts this one is deceptive in how much of a workout you get.  Though you never do anything super challenging, you can tell when you are finished that your whole body has had a workout.

Unlike a lot of exercise videos that build one big long routine that you have to keep going to the beginning of the routine every time a new step is added, Ellen builds about 4 routines.  You do each one all the way through on one side and then you repeat it on the other side.  I prefer this method than having to do the same routine over and over as you add steps.

This video has a lot of standing lower body work.  So that while you are toning your legs, you are also toning your torso as you work on your balance.  There is also just enough large range of motion exercises to keep you heart rate up there.  For me, this steady stream of moderate exertion is much more effective than a strenuous cardio workout.

I had never done any pilates or yoga - was not sure if it was for me but I really enjoy this workout.  I'm 52, not in terrible shape, but not in the shape I wish to be. This 'mind body fusion' concept has lots of stretching & that can only be a good thing!  There is no jumping around, all can be done in bare feet, no weights or equipment necessary.  Do not think it's a piece of cake though, I'm completey sweating by the middle of it and I mean wet hair & all.  Ellen and the two girls don't look even a bit hot, which bothered me a bit, but maybe if I continue to do this routine for months & months, I'll be able to look cool too??

After the 45min, you feel better and all the tensions of the day are gone. I even can't wait to do it after a long hard day at work, when i usually don't want to do anything.

I am 60 years old and have always done some mild yoga to keep my body flexible and my core strong. I've never been one to do weight lifting or serious cardio. Ellen's workouts keep me feeling great. I alternate between the three videos during the week (Mon, Wed, Fri)and do my treadmill in between for more cardio. Over the years, I've joined various exercise programs only to quit because of the inconvenience. With Ellen, I can do the routines right in my own home, first thing in the morning, then get on with my day. I have two other of her tapes, but prefer the three I mentioned. I believe these exercise programs will keep me feeling good and hopefully prevent some of the stiffness and lack of mobility that plagues many of us as we get older.

If you want something that tones, stretches, sculpts AND raises your heartrate, without causing a lot of stress and impact to the body, this is the DVD for you.  There are some days where I can't even get through the whole thing because it works you out so well.  You really need to pace yourself and not overdo it, as it can poop you out quickly and impact completing the workout.  Ellen is great, her cues are perfect, she is good about monitoring correct form amd posture, and she encourages you to go at your own pace and do what is best for you.

It flows very smoothly together and it really gets your heart rate up without feeling depleted.  And if you have ever purchased any of her other dvds, you know that Ellen makes the exercises fun.  She really has a calming, friendly voice.  There's no shouting or yelling to get more out of you.  And just so you don't think that I am some out-of-shape person, I am a marathon runner and I use her pilates and yoga videos to help me stretch and elongate my muscles.  I am definitely going to buy more.

3279159,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Ellen developed kind of a different ""concept"" for working out in her ""The Studio"" series; she calls it ""mind-body fusion"": a mix between pilates, yoga and dance. Basically it consists in working on two opposites: ""crunching"" and ""extending"". This way of exercising your muscles 2-ways makes a lot of sense to me and seems more natural. With Ellen you really ""exercise"" the stretch; it is not just stretching after your workout, it is part of your workout and you are meant to do it with the same intensity. I recently read that this is also healthier for your bones and articulations. You ""pull-in"" and then ""reach-out"" with equal intensity to have an ""organic flow"". I also think (I'm not sure) that you work more muscles and muscle-groups together. I have never done so many squats in my life; not because other workouts do not have that many, but because I never got through them. Why? Because Ellen calls them ""butterflies"". It's not just the name, it's that after the squat you draw an inverted heart with your arms and extend far up (like swimming), so this intentional movement gives your exercise kind of an ""organic flowing"" meaning and wholeness. The same happens with lunges, which become ""Tom Sawyer walks"".

Although this DVD has a workout format (a series of repetitions of the same exercise), it is not boring at all, maybe because Ellen puts two or three exercises into a combination. You do not need dancing skills either, since there is no real choreography like in aerobics. With this workout you will achieve a ""dancer's"" body, strong toned elongated muscles, not really like when you do weight lifting, but definitely toned and healthy. Your posture improves and you feel taller.

This is one of the few DVD's where I could observe immediate results, and when I say immediate, I mean as soon as you turn your DVD player off: you feel instantly energized. Ellen says it's because she includes exercises to open the chest to let more air in and she always emphasizes to ""present yourself"" like in ballet to open or lift your ""heart center"". There are only 2 other DVD's where I saw immediate results. Only by doing the step-by-sep instruction (not even the real 20 minute workout) of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Basic-3-DVD-Workout-Set-Basics-Step-By-Step-20-Minute-Workout-Accelerated-Body-Sculpting/dp/B00077BD7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Basic 3 DVD Workout Set (Basics Step-By-Step/20 Minute Workout/Accelerated Body Sculpting)</a>&nbsp;my back felt right where it should be and I slept like a baby (better than with yoga). However, the Winsor Pilates is boring to such an extent that I have only done it twice, even though I really think it helps. The yoga session of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Belly-Dance-with-Rachel-Brice-Bellydance-Technique-Yoga-for-Strong-Relaxed-Sinuous-Movement/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement</a>&nbsp;is easy to do and shorter than almost anything I have tried, with immediate results for your back and hips by releasing the muscles in theses areas.

SAFETY
Take a bit of care with your knees in some of the exercises (I have an injury, and in this DVD there are some specific exercises that I put special care how I place myself).

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Very good CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Very Good FUN FACTOR: Very good

CONTENTS:
Warm-up, 5 segments of exercises and cool down

MUSIC:
Soft instrumental music, normally I would not play this music, but it goes very well with the workout and it also makes you feel relaxed and ""lifted"".

EMPHASIS:
Very good overall emphasis, cardio, strength, stretch as Ellen calls it. You tone legs, arms, shoulders, abs (core) and incredibly even spine (twists) and feet... It also includes several balance and flexibility exercises, which I always find very good and you also have some cardio. The DVD is best performed barefoot (I use a mat, this is basically the space you need) and all exercises are performed standing.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ FUN: This DVD is one of my favorites, you feel great when exercising plus it is fun.
+ Excellent overall emphasis: This workout tones areas other workouts don't, e.g. your feet
+ Pilates technique made fun: It has the benefits of pure pilates but it is much more fun and includes cardio
+ Simplicity: It can be done by almost anybody, since the exercises are fairly easy.
+ ""Mind-body fusion"" principle: This might sound a bit ""new agey"" (not really my stuff), but I have to admit it is true, after exercising this way I feel lifted, energized, accepting and in peace with myself.",1342224000,6,4852,5.375
3279160,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I love Ellen's workouts,and have had this one for a few years. I used it a lot, then it moved out of my regular rotation and sat around a while... but I recently rediscovered it and have to say it's the best postnatal workout (though not billed as such) It has everything the new mama needs- stretching and toning and twisting to get your back feeling a bit less hunched (all that nursing can really do a number on your back) and afterwards you feel worked out all over. My favorite thing is that there is almost no floor time (with a little baby I don't have time to vacuum the floor and workout, so I definitely don't want to lie on my floor!) I regularly do a pretty tough boot camp workout and so I'm in reasonable shape, but this got me nice and sweaty and I feel sore in the right places afterward. I am so glad I rediscovered this!",1338854400,2,838,4.179012345679013
3279161,5,B000ZZT7BS,This is the first time I have tried ellen Barratts workouts and I have to say I have been very surprised at how much I love it.  I have been exercising to Turbo Jam and Joyce Vedral but I was finding that I wasn't feeling anything but tired after the workouts.  Surprisingly I felt muscle ache the next day and that I had really had a great workout.  I love the flow and elegance plus the fact that they are barefoot.  The music I loved as it seemed quite soothing and different to anything I had worked out to before.  I really worked up a sweat and was drenched so don't be fooled into thinking this is easy for those off days when you don't want to work too hard.  Ont the other hand this is not going to kill you and you will be able to go about your day without feeling worn out like I do with turbo jam and turbo fire.  I have been working out since I was a teenager continually so I am in very good shape and have kept off the middle age weight gain because of this and happy to say that ellen Barratt is just great and will add a new dimension to your repetoire.  A much kinder gentler dimension.  Ellen has a great personality and is easy to listen to.  I highly recommend!,1329609600,2,1182,4.056034482758621

These exercises feel so good after sitting at a desk and wearing heels, I want to cry with happiness when my back starts to loosen up.  It's my #1 favorite mid-week workout ever.  It's not super high impact, but it does have sufficient intensity and length that it's not a strictly ""light"" work-out video.
Highly recommended",1328400000,3,417,4.533333333333333
3279183,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I really love Ellen Barrett's workouts, for many of the reasons others have already pointed out. This workout works your whole body in a way that is invigorating, not exhausting. It's great for any time! If you're someone who wants a ""no pain no gain"" type of hardcore approach, this may not appeal to you unless you're up for an easy day or if you're pregnant, for example. (In my opinion, this workout is perfect for any stage of pregnancy -- there are no flat on the back floor exercises, no bouncing, and your heart rate gets up, but not out of control.) But if you're ready for a mind-body approach to low-impact barefoot cardio, this is for you.

In short, I feel recharged after this video: strengthened, stretched, revitalized. 5 invigorating stars!

P.S.: I almost forgot to mention: All of Ellen's workouts are extremely easy to follow. No sudden changes or difficult to follow moves. That's extremely important for someone who's choreography-challenged like me!",1320537600,3,972,4.884848484848485

For anyone who likes to get a really good workout and wants to feel great and energized afterwards, this workout will be perfect.  I started with Ellen Barrett in 2006 and come back to her every time.  I have tried others, but they don't work near as well for me.  I get a wonderful workout, get toned and feel great.  And I get all this with no jumping or doing moves that I can't follow. Try her at least once; I think most will agree :)",1313712000,2,663,4.069230769230769

3279189,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I'm writing a new review for this DVD since the I have finally resolved the ""dragging"" and ""hesitating"" issue that I had with Ellen Barrett's Studio line of DVDs.  I have new copies of the all of them, including this one and no problems at all now!
I absolutely love Ellen Barrett and I love this DVD.  As she says in the video, the workout is deceptive.  It feels wonderful.  Your heart rate goes up, your muscles engage, and it feels GOOD. I use this workout the day after I have used weights or done serious ab work.  This one keeps me in the fat burning range while I tone and stretch the muscles I worked to failure the day before.  I really believe that using this video and her other Studio videos helps me to maintain my balance and flexibilty, and the ability of all of my muscles to work together.
I wish I could workout in Ellen's studio.  She is a fantastic instructor, giving the prompts I need to maintain correct form.  She is supportive and encouraging, but not ""cheesy"" or too chatty.  The routine in this video is carefully choreographed and each movement transitions seemlessly to the next.",1302912000,3,1109,4.477611940298507

3279191,4,B000ZZT7BS,"Fat Burning Fusion is a wonderful cardio/stretching DVD especially for those over 50 or for those who have back or knee problems. Also a good ""in-between workouts stretch"" for high impact lovers. Ellen's voice is soothing but upbeat and inspiring. No cutsie cheerleading pump up here! You do get your heart rate up but it's definitely not as strenuous as high impact aerobics. It's ballet, pilates combined which is great for your back and muscles. I didn't think I'd like the barefooted idea but that's turned out to be a wonderful asset! I will buy more of Ellen Barrett's workouts.",1295654400,4,584,4.85

Ellen stresses that you should focus on form and, if you do that, this is a challenging workout with cardio, toning and stretch.  This is a good low impact workout.  I don't like jumping around and feeling like I can't follow complicated choreography.  Ellen's moves are fluid and relatively easy to follow.  She explains that her exercises complement the feminine form and that you don't need heavy weights to get a strength workout--you can use the weight of your own body.  This is challenging workout that energizes and relaxes.",1284681600,8,706,4.691056910569106
3279194,4,B000ZZT7BS,"Well, for starters, the IDEA of the low-impact standing Pilates workout is what grabbed my attention. Before purchasing this DVD, I enjoyed working out to Leslie Sansone in-home walking workout DVDs (I still do, just not as often), and I wasn't at all familiar with or even aware of Ellen. However, since I live on the 8th floor, I felt the need to find a workout that would be powerful and help me to sculpt a lean, graceful body without making stomping noises, for the sake of the poor tenants living on the 7th floor. Since I rarely have the patience to do exercises on the mat, I thought I hit gold here when I found this title online. This was it--the low-impact STANDING PILATES WORKOUT! I thought it'd be a piece of cake. Something to do casually, whenever I could spare the time, before going to work in the morning. A breeze. Boy was I wrong. This NEVER FAILS to break me into a sweat. Not just a little dampness, either, it's dripping sweat that I refer to. It's summer right now and of course the hot weather is probably making me sweat by default, but this is a TOUGH workout. It's certainly not for ""sissies."" Form is so so SO important. Each time I do it, I appreciate it even more. I feel that my arms are becoming more lean, and I can see that this is having positive effects on my entire body. At first the plie squats were seriously getting on my nerves and annoying the heck out of my knees, but the more I do them the easier they get, and the more capable I become of doing them. Not to say that this is a perfect DVD--for instance, I wish Ellen would give more specific instruction on HOW to do certain moves instead of constantly repeating to ""stand up tall"" and ""lift the heart."" Overall, I think this is a great workout for those who are looking to tone and sculpt and stretch their bodies. It will certainly break a sweat, but not in the way you may be used to. If you're looking to breeze through your workout and not think too much (and I certainly enjoy these types of workouts as well), this probably isn't for you. For those types of workouts, I recommend Leslie Sansone DVDs or just plain running.",1282521600,23,2128,4.335839598997493

After previewing both this and barefoot cardio, I picked fbf. I previewed, and then about-regretably-a month later, I actually started doing it. Some have had complaints about the cuing, on the contrary, I thought she had excellent cuing in comparison to ybb, hemalyaa, and the skinny b! tch series. She was easy to follow, the work out itself was pretty fluid, and it made me feel graceful. It was easy enough to do it while the video was going, then the next day, I could feel it in my core and 'back fat' region. I'm usually pretty uninspired, because I have a good metabolism-dont hate me!-and don't have to exercise, but I know its good for my mind and body. With this dvd I really felt the connection. With ybb, I felt like a jackass doing the moves. I cannot sexy dance or 'work it' or 'shake it' or any other idioms they tried to tell me to get me moving my groove thing. My things don't grove that way. haha. The fluid ballet/pilates motion this has suits me better. Over all I very much enjoyed it. I didn't notice the music, and I thought that the production was pretty good, also people have said the other two girls weren't very good. I thought they were good additions, to make people who are new or slightly out of shape to feel more comfortable doing the work out. Excercise dvds aren't just for skinny, toned people, you guys.

Great for keeping my abs flat and muscular, but still feminine. I have MS, so I wanted a fitness video that could keep me fit without an intensive workout... and her videos are perfect! I mostly use her videos as a supplementation to walking, biking and using the elliptical trainer.

Regarding some of the reviews that criticize the lack of cardio, I think we need to be realistic about what this dvd really is.  I do this work out in the mornings (and switch off with her other videos) before work and it's just the right amount of movement to get my blood flowing and get me stretched out for the day.  As well, the breathing and the flow of the movements help clear the mind and get you focused.  I do alternate cario workouts (running) and stregnth training dvds throughout the week and find this to be a good supplement to Ellen's workouts.  I look forward to her workouts, whereas I may not be super excited to run or lift weights.  If you stick with her workouts, you will see results.  The tops of and the inner parts of my legs are firmer than they have ever been as just a runner.  You will get that long and lean look with her videos and for those of you that miss the weights, the sweat and the cardio, try the series she did with Self magazine and use a five pound set.
PS:  She is not not boring either.  She is lovely and nice.  :)  Repetition is expected so go with the flow.",1264118400,10,1414,4.231343283582089
3279203,4,B000ZZT7BS,"I love Ellen Barrett, especially her workouts on FIT TV.  I was very excited about this DVD, and while the workout itself was fabulous, everything else was disappointing.  The backdrop in the studio is a little distracting.  Also, the lighting and sound of the DVD is not high-quality.  You can see shadows all over the floor, and the music is fairly boring.

The only negative aspects of the video is the music and the set.  I love Ellen's Self Bikini ready fast video with the beach background. There is a theme throughout all of her videos and I always finish feeling strong, relaxed and energized all at once.  I also love that her movements are complementary to the female body, creating long lean muscles instead of building bulk.  As others mentioned Ellen is upbeat without being annoying.  I'm canceling my gym membership and using these videos combined with long hikes and tennis.

I would not recommend this video for anyone who has knee problems due to the high repetition of plies. I would recommend Melissa Lowe's Ballet Workout for a ballet class workout. I found my knees didn't bother me while doing the Ballet Workout as long as I modified the grand plies to plies. For all-around fun DVDs that include jazz, ballet, modern dance yoga, Bollywood, burlesque and Latin dancing, I recommend the Yoga Booty Ballet series. The teachers can be a little over-the-top on the metaphysical comments sometimes, but I always have fun working out with them.

It has no floor work for abs, which may be a pro or a con depending on your point of view. The arm work is pretty light. This is a good overall routine to intersperse with other targeted workouts.

I exercise for many years, but I never did gymnastics or any serious sports, so I can say that I still amateur.  I discovered Ellen Barrett DVDs just recently.  Before that I worked with Denise Austin and Karen Vought and loved several of their workouts, but I needed something new.  So I searched Amazon, read peoples reviews, watched samples on YouTube.  I decided to try Ellen Barrett new Studio workout because I liked music in the sample. (I have all three DVDs; my favorite is ""The Studio - Fat burning fusion"").  I was rewarded.

Ellen Barrett has excellent personality, her voice is very pleasant to hear, all moves are flows from one to another one, and, after workout is complete, I feel great.  Excellent music helps not just to do exercises, but also to ease your mind; it makes me smile and feel like I perform, not just doing exercise.

Please do not pay attention that someone said it's boring.  It's not.  Ellen Barrett put good number of repetitions, but in order to achieve result you need to do 8 - 16 times the same move, not just jump from one move to another one; also to master a proper form you need to do the same move over and over again.  But even for the same leg or hand Ellen provides variety of exercises and a set does not goes for more than 5 minutes. (Set is several different exercises for the same hand or leg).  The beauty of them is that they done in some special order which make your heart elevated (without jumping Jacks), and at the same time your muscles straightened or stretched.

I like when she says ""elegant arms"", ""happy feet"" or ""whatever you're best, it's perfect"" or ""good work everybody"".  These simple words make me feel as part of the group.  And if to summarize the experience in just one sentence:  It's not a workout, it's like a performance that you can do each single day and have a pleasure doing it.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone who wants to feel young, a little bit artistic, and just happy.

Thank you to everyone who wrote reviews before me.  You helped me to find a new perfect trainer.",1234742400,29,2218,4.771653543307087
3279217,4,B000ZZT7BS,"This is not as sleepy as a typical pilates workout, but you won't get cardio benefits from it. My heartrate is around 40-50% of maximum - better than traditional pilates, but not great. The routines are interesting ballet/pilates stretching - no weights involved. The sides of my thighs usually ache the next day. I like the instructor - very calm and upbeat.",1234742400,,359,4.806451612903226
3279218,4,B000ZZT7BS,"Although the package for this workout bills it as ""liquid barefoot cardio"" (who could resist trying that??) it's not much of a cardio routine, as it barely got my heartrate elevated. But... I'd still give it four stars, as this is a wonderful routine for stretching and lengthening muscles and relieving stress. I love doing these movements, and use the workout on lighter days to stretch out and reduce stress. I find that I really look forward to this workout, especially after a few harder days of working out. There are also some great lower body exercises toward the end of the routine.",1233619200,2,591,4.747572815533981
3279219,5,B000ZZT7BS,"WOW WOW WOW! Is all I can think of saying. I am very impressed by Ellen's Fat Burning Fusion DVD.
As a new Mommy of an 8 month old baby, this workout allows me to burn fat thru aerobics. HOWEVER, unlike any other workout video I have ever done, at the same time, it releases my stress and makes my muscles feel great. I'll attribute this to the perfect pace/tempo of the music and workout as well as all the amazing message like stretches that heal my body after  a day of lifting and lugging my baby everywhere!

As a professional singer/songwriter, I need to keep in tip top shape so I can be strong to travel and stand for long performances. II have added this workout as well as Fahtiems' Belly Dance Boot Camp Volume 2 and walking to my weekly workout agenda. Counting carbs and monitoring them is also part of my plan. I have lost a few inches in 2 weeks and have lost 5 pounds.

THANK YOU ELLEN!!!

3279220,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This workout is deceptive. Done properly you will sweat and your muscles will feel the effects afterwards. This is a thorough workout--all muscles are worked with a very good cardiovascular component. One word of caution, if you are at all uncoordinated there are some moves toward the end of the workout that require some thought and probably should be practiced in isolation. However,this is a workout that leaves you feeling energized and invigorated. I like the fact you don't need shoes but you should have a yoga or pilates mat. Ellen is inspiring and lively without being annoying and the music is also motivating. I particularly like it as I work out very early in the morning and don't always enjoy a lot of hyperactivity and noise.",1232409600,4,741,4.84251968503937
3279221,2,B000ZZT7BS,"While this is gentle on the body if you have back/knee issues, it's BORING and repetitious. It drove me crazy.

Just when you think, thank GOD this is almost done, you realize you still have the OTHER side of your body to work out.  After a half an hour, frankly, I was done! Not physically, but mentally.

I did feel the burn the next day and it honestly helped my torn rotator cuff, BUT the thought of doing it again left little to be desired. I like to either work both sides of my body one after the other or at the same time.  I think it's just a mental thing, but it makes the time seem to go by faster.

If you don't mind this, this is a great workout; if you DO mind it, keep looking for others out there that offer great benefits without the mental strain (i.e. Leslie Sansone, my fave)!",1228089600,14,796,4.109677419354838

3279225,5,B000ZZT7BS,"This is my favorite exercise dvd.  I would consider this an intermediate workout.  The workout is approximately 45 minutes and during that time you are getting a lot of aerobics and toning exercises.  I usually try to do this workout at least twice a week and it really has made my legs more shapely.

Towards the end of the workout, before the cool down, there are great exercises for your arms, plus leg toning exercises.  This dvd is a total body workout that will tone your muscles.  I really like the spine twist exercises since sometimes I have problems with my back.  Ellen says that spine twists are very healthy for the back.  This is a fantastic dvd to get your body in better shape.",1221436800,4,693,4.488

The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is Ellen tends to work one side then the other rather than alternating and I don't enjoy that as much as I might.  Anyway, it's a really good low impact workout with pleasant music and a ""community center"" atmosphere.  I wish she would produce a lot more - I would buy them all.

While doing this workout, I kept thinking how much Fat Burning Fusion felt like Burn & Firm Pilates without the weights.  BUT, Burn & Firm Pilates is a much more superior workout because there are some challenging parts to it and it moves a lot faster.  Fat Burning Fusion moved way too slowly and the moves were uninteresting and repetitive.  It barely got my heart rate up and I couldn't wait for it to be over.",1220486400,6,1091,7.611111111111111
3279229,5,B000ZZT7BS,"Ellen Barrett has her own style of workout she's developed specifically for women. Her goal is to combine cardio, toning and stretching together simultaneously instead of doing them separately, and she does this by a ""fusion"" of workout elements taken from pilates, yoga, dance/ballet, sports fitness and more traditional calisthenics and aerobics. Plus she aspires to arrange these elements into a flowing, low-stress, low-impact yet cardio-, musclar- and stretching-intense workout that is complimentary to the female body. Sounds like a Herculean task, doesn't it? Well, thankfully Barrett's been at this for quite awhile - she is a former tennis pro who got into aerobics and fitness in the 80's - and so really knows what she's doing. As result she's succeeded in making a very efficient, effective and comfortable workout style that works your entire body. Barrett's approach is so efficient and comfortable that you'll probably not even realize how much of a workout this is until you've done it a few times and become more aware of how this makes your body work. As for effective - when I started doing Barrett's FitTV workouts, I noticed improvement in stamina, strength, flexibility and body tone with a couple weeks, when I discovered how much easier housecleaning and daily tasks had become, that my jeans were bit looser around the waist and how my thigh and bicep muscles were little more defined.

This particular workout on this DVD is mostly standing, with only a bare minimal of matwork. Count that as a major positive - standing exercises are not only helpful with improving your heart strength and blood flow to your extremities, the simple act of bearing you own weight during exercise improves your bone density and prevents bone loss, particularly in the spine and hips - the bones often most affected by osteopenia and osteoporosis. Plus, I personally like that you can do this workout barefoot. My feet really appreciate any opportunity to exercise without socks, shoes and all that sweat. While Barrett doesn't use weights in this workout, I suppose one could use 1-2 lb ankle and wrist weights of the workout. But I find this workout sufficiently intense enough without any added weights. While many exercises are similar to what you'll find in her ""Pilates Sculpt"" and ""Slo-robics"" workouts on FitTV's Allstar Workouts, they are done in a very different order and with additional exercises not seen on the FitTV workouts. Also, Barrett goes a little more indepth with the technique, form and logic of the exercises. This is overall a more challenging and intense workout, partly because you don't get commercial breaks and partly because, since there's no breaks, Barrett gets into more diverse series that really make your muscles work and stretch. I was doing her FitTV workouts 3-5 times a week for several weeks now before I got this DVD, and I still work up quite a good sweat with this one. In fact the first few times, I had to modify some of the exercise or take a break when my arms or thighs were getting a little too tired.

There's is quite a bit of plis and other knee-bending work, but I found the entire workout very agreeable for my 30-something knees. Like her FitTV workout, Barrett's flowing, low-impact combos are not only easy on the knees, but can safely strengthen and flex the knee region, which can potentially alleviate some types of knee pain. If you're still worried about knee strain, these exercise are quite doable if you need to wear a knee brace or patella band, or one could easily change the width of stance of the range of motion to make it easier on problem knees. This workout is also very good for problem ankles and feet, as a lot of these exercises strengthen and flex those areas as well.

Another plus about this workout is, again like her FitTV workouts , this is a phenomenal workout for the back and spine. Got lower back pain? Is your back often stiff, tired and achy? Want better posture? Give this workout a try. Barrett puts special attention to strengthening and flexing the back safely and effectively with a variety of twists, bends and stretches spread throughout the workout. Thanks to her ""fusion"" approach, these exercise are also very beneficial for your other core muscles. I have found these exercises so helpful in alleviating back pain and stiffness that I'll do a few of them whenever my back's giving me trouble - it works better than pain pills or a heating pain!

Lastly, this is a very feminine and stressing-relieving workout. Because most the exercises are simultaneously working one muscles group while stretching another, you'll likely feel little in the way of cramping or soreness, and it give your body a diverse range of motion to release any tension. Also a lot of these movements are very flattering to the female form, improving your muscle tone and posture for more feminine body shape. In additional to improving your tone and posture, Barrett's employs a ""mind-body"" approach that helps you mentally connect with your body and how it moves. This really improves gracefulness, body awareness and overall poise as well as allows you to better relax and rechannel stress into constructive energy.",1220400000,42,5202,4.914675767918089
3279230,4,B000ZZT7BS,"I love Ellen Barrett, but this workout is so different than the others I have done of hers, and is much more low impact and slow moving.

It's such a nice way to work out and to break a sweat.  There are quite a few parts where she does faster moves like ""skater"" and it's just great.

3279233,3,B000ZZT7BS,"I am a veteran of Cathe Freiderich and P90X workouts.  This workout delivers a less intense, but certainly not effortless exercise.

I liked the the gracefulness and elegance of the moves - something you don't get a lot of in Cathe workouts or P90X workouts.

Ellen Barrett is an encouraging and positive instructor.  Her voice is pleasant to listen to and her smile is mega-wattage!

In the section entitled ""Welcome to the Studio"", I got the sense that there was not an outright 'anti-weights' vibe but instead a 'you don't need to lift heavy weights' vibe, which I thought was unfortunate.  Women should be lifting weights - and heavy ones too, to optimize the benefits to not just their muscles but their bones, especially.

I got it 2 weeks ago, and have been using it 5 or 6 times- I definitely LOVE this one. Ellen is a great instructor like all other reviewers said, and I just love everything about this DVD. The music is enjoyable and you can follow the temple easily; the movement is natural while challenging enough you'll feel it after you're done.  Also, the length of the workout fits my everyday schedule perfectly- I don't need to find anything else to do after this DVD because I'll get everything I needed within the 45 minutes workout. Again, I'd highly recommend to those who love Ellen's style, natural movement and just enjoyable workout.",1206230400,3,737,4.625954198473282
3279239,5,B000ZZT7BS,"What a great workout! Not the same old thing. After doing the video for the first time yesterday, I feel just the right amount of soreness that tells me I worked out arms and legs in a meaningful way-- and I enjoyed the workout tremendously. A wonderful complement to weight routines-- lots of nice lengthening moves. It's clear that a lot of thought and preparation went into the design of the routine. And Ellen has got to be the least irritating video trainer I have experienced in a long time. The cueing is excellent. I could not be more enthusiastic. I immediately bought several more of her videos and am eagerly awaiting delivery.",1204588800,8,638,4.654867256637168
3279240,5,B000ZZT7BS,"I am a big fan of Ellen Barrett's, and have been for a couple of years. My favorite routine of her's, up to now, was the one she created for FitTV's ""All Star Workouts"" called Zen Sculpt. My next favorite, also from ""All Star Workouts"" was her Slow-robics. This new DVD, ""Fat Burning Fusion"" is from Ellen's Buff Girl Fitness productions, and does not disappoint!  It is a great workout from start to finish, and is very challenging and tough if done correctly.  You will get out of it what you put in to it.  Her focus is not always on what is moving, but what isn't moving.

A little note about Ellen's style...she isn't for those who want a bulky physique. She is more about elongating and strengthening the muscles for a lean and feminine dancer's body. Her routines blend Plilates with dance, with mind/body integration. The entire program works all areas of the body--the powerhouse, the heart center, and the limbs. So, you burn calories, build muscle, and stretch through each move smoothly and gracefully. You will feel this the next day--especially in the legs and glutes.

Working out with Ellen is not easy, but it is gentle to the body. If you want hard-core cardio, with lots of jumping around and kick-boxing, she's not for you. If you want to look like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen won't get you there. However, if you want to be toned, flexible, long and lean, she's your gal. Done on a regular basis, you will see results. This is Ellen at her very best-great cuing, easy explanations, and fun!",1204070400,162,1506,4.6254681647940075
3279241,4,B000ZZT7BS,"This DVD is 46 minutes of standing work only that blends pilates, ballet, and cardio together for a complete workout session. Ellen has a very soothing, non-aggravating voice and she gives clear instructions and time to prepare for the next movement. I like her casual reminders to breathe and how relaxing all of the movements seem. She won't have you jumping around and exercising 'hard' but you'll still get a great workout and have increased energy when you're done. There are a few issues with the DVD - first, the music. Unless you like jazz/Santana then you might not like the music playing along with the moves; there is no way to turn it off, so you have to just get used to it. Second, the length of the DVD is 46 minutes and it runs as a continuous workout, so you cannot break it down or select portions at will - you either play it all or cut it off when you get tired. Third, if you have Fit TV on cable - don't buy this DVD - Ellen is much better on Fit TV's Slowrobics than on this DVD, and the moves are almost identical. Plus, on the Fit TV Slowrobics show you get leg/floorwork that you won't get here. This Fusion DVD is just an expanded version of the Fit TV show, so just tape those and you have the same thing, with the added benefit of better music and better, more colorful outfits to look at.",1203552000,15,1318,4.276

8236417,5,B000ZZT7BS,This was one of her studio releases that i didn't have and heard a lot of good stuff about the workout. I'm so glad i was able to get it. It was used but in very good condition. The workout is great. Although it's one of her longer workouts it really went fast. It was very dance based. There were a lot of ballet inspired moves which felt great. I felt energized but not tired. It had a great flow to it.  I definitely recommend this workout.,1506470400,2,443,4.091954022988506

Ellen breaks up the fast paced maneuvers with some slow ones, which helps with posture and breathing, benefiting your core workout. I've done this video for over a year and I'm still sore every time I do it, as I get better and stronger, I go deeper into each move.",1465344000,,370,4.3768115942028984
