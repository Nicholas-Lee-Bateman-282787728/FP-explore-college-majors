5320738,5,B009DL62LS,"This series, which comes out of Canada, is one of the best family dramas I have ever seen! I love that it centers around a horse farm for rescued and problem horses! All the characters are great and the chemistry between the two main characters is wonderful yet they handle it in a very tasteful way. There is also a lot of humorous parts too! Over all I highly recommend this if you like a good, wholesome entertainment experience similar to Little House on the Prairie but set in modern times! I bought all 5 seasons and hope that Amazon will carry the 6th season when it is released!",1364515200,7,586,4.385321100917431

Since most of the players are Canadians  they are not that well known in the Southern U. S.
