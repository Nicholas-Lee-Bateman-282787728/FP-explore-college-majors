8313367,1,B001JP65P4,"I purchased this to replace a a self-made copy of this segment which aired a few years ago. It does an outstanding job illustrating response prevention in the treatment of OCD with several different types of cases.  It also ""humanizes"" this disorder by demonstrating the immense psychological suffering and functional impairment (i.e., loss of jobs, failed marriages, agoraphobia, depression with suicidal behavior)that can accompany it, as well as how personally challenging exposure can be. (Several real exposure sessions are featured, including one in which the person became so distressed they were not able to complete the session.) I show this in introductory and clinical psychology courses. Outstanding content for learning more about OCD, people with OCD, and effective treatment. Even though it's an older air date, the content will always be good.  (They don't discuss specific medications, which might change with time, and response prevention is an effective strategy that will always ""look"" the same.)

I wanted to show this in a class I have tomorrow.  Unfortunately the DVD doesn't play (tried three devices). So in addition to now needing to prep something different for class, I'll also have to make an unnecessary out of the way trip to the post office to return a worthless item. I requested a replacement and will update if it is any better.

UPDATE 7/25: Replacement plays on my computer and 1 of my 2 DVD players. (Not even sure how this is possible? I inserted another DVD right before and after it, so I know it's not my player.)  I'm keeping it but my advice is that you allow enough time to order this and make sure it's going to work on whatever player you want to ultimately use it on.",1342483200,2,1715,4.9375
