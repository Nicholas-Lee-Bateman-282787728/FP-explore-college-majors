6991337,5,B00SL9CWQC,"When Jackie Carpenter's son is falsely accused of murder, she prays for a miracle and fights against all odds to set him free. When the prosecution seeks a life sentence for her son, Jackie's world spins into turmoil, sending her on a journey that ultimately brings her to her knees and - thankfully - a triumphant resurgence into faith. The circumstances of her son's situation causes Jackie Carpenter to test her faith and totally lean on God for the results she can only hope He will provide.

The story takes place in Georgia and opens with green farm country and a quaint little town. Jackie and Larry Carpenter have two adult sons. Jim is the older son and he's a minister. Jason is the younger brother and he is married with a young son, and is in the business of real estate. Because Jason's properties are robbed 17 times or so, he decides that he will go and keep watch at night to see if he can catch the thieves and call the police.

As it turns out, Jackie and Larry get a call in the middle of the night from Jason's wife, Stephanie, in the middle of the night telling them that Jason has been arrested for murder.  Suddenly their lives as they know it is over, and everything is chaotic. Jason's wife struggles, not knowing what to say to their son, while Jackie vows she will do everything she can to get her son out of jail and back home. A touching scene is when Jason is so distraught being incarcerated while waiting for trial and he calls home. Instead of talking with his wife and son, they sing him a song while Stephanie plays piano. You can see the small bit of peace he is able to find in this very small moment.

Jason is charged with felony murder. As the movie progresses, the charges against Jason are reduced because the police officer who initially arrested Jason was let go from his position due to poor behavior. The charges are then further reduced to voluntary manslaughter to which Jason was to receive 3 to 5 years in prison if only he would plead guilty. After much deliberation within his family, Jason and Stephanie believe that God wants Jason to choose the trial.

At one point in the trial proceedings, the attorney representing Jason suggests that Jackie not take her Bible into the trial because it might offend a juror. I loved how she dug her heels in, pointed out she could offend a juror for many other reasons as well, and takes her Bible with her anyway. As she walks into the courtroom, Jackie's friends and the community support her by raising the pages of Psalms they have each brought with them into the courtroom themselves.

Throughout the movie, we really don't know what actually happened that night. We hear conflicting stories from one of the eye witnesses, but throughout the movie we never hear what really happened that night. In the courtroom, Jason testifies to the facts of that night and then we know. I'm not going to give you the ending - get the movie and find out what happens at trial - don't assume you know.

Stand Your Ground shows us how life can test the faith of each and every one of us. It has a clearly communicated message by both Jackie and Jason to stand your ground and fight for what you believe against all the odds. Stand Your Ground is a powerful witness for the power of prayer and faith in God. It reminds us to rely on His strength instead of our own.

Just last week I heard a sermon on letting stufft go, giving it to God, admitting we are powerless, and trusting that he can take care of whatever situation we give Him. This movie shows us exactly that. God does - and will - intervene, carry us through the midst of our troubles, and will bring us through, regardless of the outcome.

The movie was based on the books by Jackie Carpenter, The Bridge"" Between Cell Block A and a Miracle is Psalm 91 and Georgia Justice: Journey To Faith. I don't think any movie made based on the sharing of a mother's heart could go wrong, and I'm sure the books are even better.",1430524800,4,3960,4.428571428571429

The following is Ted Baehr's MovieGuide review:

Content:

(CCC, BBB, VV, M) Very strong Christian worldview as woman prays to God and visits church with Christian cross in the pulpit, man is a Christian minister, the Bible is read, and Psalms are referenced, and woman plays piano while singing hymn;  brief strong violence includes prison inmate gets bullied and beat up by men in jail at showers, a man is shot and blood splatters on van and another mans face; no sex upper male nudity of men in showers; no alcohol use; no smoking or drugs; and, married couple quarrels, lying, and a police office is a bad role model.

Summary:

STAND YOUR GROUND is inspired by true events in the life of Jackie Carpenter who must learn to depend totally on God when her son is falsely accused of murder. STAND YOUR GROUND is a good movie with a strong Christian worldview, but it does have some violence, so caution is warranted for older children.

Review:

STAND YOUR GROUND is inspired by true events in the life of Jackie Carpenter, whose son was accused of murder.

The story takes place in Georgia and opens with green farm country and a quaint little town. Jackie Carpenter (Francine Locke) and her husband Larry Carpenter (Darrel Ervin) are fairly wealthy with a nice home. Jackie has two adult sons. Jim (John Dollar), her eldest, is a minister, and Jason (Drew Matthews), the younger brother, is in real estate.

Jasons properties in a new development have been robbed 17 times so. Against his mothers wishes, he decides hell go and keep watch at night to see if he can catch the robbers and call the police. Jackie and Larry get a call that Jason has been arrested for murder, and their peaceful world turns into chaos.

Its an emotional time as the family speaks to him through the glass at the jail. Jasons wife, Stephanie, struggles, not knowing what to say to their 6-year-old son. Jackie vows to do all she can to see her son out of jail and back home.

Throughout STAND YOUR GROUND, Jackie, Jason, and their whole familys faith is tested. Initially, Jason is charged with felony murder. However, the charges are reduced due to the fact that they were given to Jason by an unethical policeman later released from duty because of his constant poor behavior. Eventually, his charges would be dropped to voluntary manslaughter, and he would have only three to five years in prison, if only he pleads guilty. Or, he could let it go to trial and be at the mercy of the jury.

Jason and Stephanie believe God wants Jason to choose the trial. Jackie still tries hard to take matters into her own hands. However, after a potentially fatal car accident on the way to the lawyers office, she finally accepts she is powerless, and all she can do is to meditate on the book of Psalms and trust God. The lawyer and family suggest Jackie not take her Bible to the trial because it may offend a juror. She stands her ground and takes her Bible anyway and is greeted by supporting friends and community who have brought scriptures in Psalms with them into the courtroom.

Eventually, as the trial continues in STAND YOUR GROUND, Jason himself goes to testify. For the first time, the viewers find out what happened that night.

Now, what will the jury decide?

The production quality of STAND YOUR GROUND is fairly good. The movie also has a clear message communicated by both Jackie and Jason to stand your ground and fight for what you believe against all the odds. Jackies character evolves into one who learned to listen to God. This gives her a great character arc. Of course, STAND YOUR GROUND has a very strong Christian worldview that urges people to put their faith and trust in God through Jesus Christ. However, there is brief violence, so caution is advised for older children.

Spiritually speaking, much can be said about how faith can enable people to trust God when they feel letting go seems to make them weaker or powerless. Just like Jackie, people go through situations they cant change or influence. Yet, in those moments, if people can let go, having done all they could  even when they made a mistake  if they allow God, He will intervene, carry them in the midst of that trial, and bring them through to a place of peace and safety. So, the next time you stand your ground, let God carry you.

In Brief:

STAND YOUR GROUND is inspired by true events in the life of Jackie Carpenter, whose son was falsely accused of murder. Jackie vows to do all she can to see her son, Jason, out of jail and back home. Throughout the trial, Jackie, Jason, and their whole familys faith is tested. Finally, Jason himself testifies. For the first time, viewers find out what happened the night of the murder. After compelling closing arguments from lawyers on both sides, what will the jury decide?

The Dove Foundation Review:
""Five-Dove Rating"" - - Dove ""Family-Approved"" For Ages 12 and Over

Synopsis
When Jackie Carpenters son, Jason, is accused of murder she fights against the odds to free him; but when the prosecution seeks a life sentence, both Jackies and Jasons world spins into turmoil sending them on parallel journeys of wavering faith and tentative hope. Stand Your Ground is the true story of tragedy, trust and triumph and of a cry for justice.

Dove Review
This movie is well made and suspenseful. It features a great story based on actual events. The acting is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and at the end was waiting with great anticipation to learn whether the character named Jason Veitch was found innocent or guilty. The movie is based on a book by Jackie Carpenter, played superbly in the movie by Francine Locke. Her son, Jason, also played superbly by Drew Matthews, is accused of killing a man when a gun goes off following a man and two friends trying to rob him. They had been robbing copper from the place he was working and when he couldn't get the law to help he took an officers advice to watch for the thieves himself. There had been 17 previous robberies! When he catches them in a truck on his property and has the three lie down on the ground while he attempts to call for police help, one of them makes a move for him and the gun goes off.

Jasons mom is told to live in the Psalms and this is what she does during the trial, a trial that could see Jason exonerated or sent to prison for thirty years. She is given advice not to bring her Bible to the trial but she ignores the advice and packs it with her. Her Christian friends stand with her in prayer and in attending the trial. The title of the film, Stand Your Ground, comes from a law that says people have a right to defend their own property and to stand their ground. Jason speaks on his own behalf with the determination to just tell the truth. When it is learned the verdict will be rendered the following day, Jasons son asks if his dad will be picking him up after school. Maybe the boys mom replies. The climax of the film will have the viewer holding his/her breath as the verdict is about to be read. Although this movie isn't intended for the very young, the content is relatively mild. We are pleased to award this stirring and fantastic production five Doves, our best rating!

6991344,5,B00SL9CWQC,"I had the privilege to see this movie when it was at theaters in Pearl, MS in 2014, and I have to say it is one of those films that lingers with you long after the credits roll.

To see the journey of Jackie Carpenter and her family as they not only fight for the future of her song Jason but their faith is something that many of us can relate to. Things can happen in our lives so quickly, and it is so easy to do things our way. What this film reminds us of is that when it comes to the principles that our Creator gives us in His word that is what we have to stand our ground on.

Jackie tried to do everything she could to save her son, almost to the point of destroying herself physically in the process. What she had to learn---and is not always easy for any of us to accept---is that she didn't and doesn't have the power to save herself, let alone any one on. We are instructed to cast our burdens upon Him---and once we do that we realize that it is exactly where it belongs.

STAND YOUR GROUND is so much more than a movie. It's a reminder that when all else seems to fail, we can always look to the One that can't.",1426204800,7,1126,3.9734513274336285

6991372,4,B00SL9CWQC,"I agreed to review this DVD because I believe there will soon come a time, if it has not come already, when each of us, will need to stand our ground.  What sane, dedicated to God and family person does not, once challenged, want to stand up for his/her family, his/her rights, and his/her faith?

This movie depicts the real life experience of Jackie Carpenter, a wife and mother who had to do just that when it seemed the system was taking care of itself -- at the expense of the truth and her son.

In the process, Carpenter feels she is forced to take on not only her husband who prefers not to make any trouble, her advisors, her sons lawyer, and ultimately God Himself.  She tells God that if He won't fix this when He hears the cry for justice [which also happens to be the movies sub-title], she will.

It is at this point that she may have felt as abandoned as Christ may have felt on the cross when He uttered the words, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me? It was not an easy place for Jesus to have been and it is never an easy place for any of His followers to be  to feel like that. Understanding that God is still there and cares very much requires great commitment and dedication  a faith that you do not get until you have to be there. Carpenter has to come to grips with her options. She can fight this alone with her own human capabilities and knowledge or she can let God be God and participate as a child of His while still fulfilling her role as a mother and watching her son suffer.

Trusting God and accepting what He allows are two different things as Carpenter finds out. And some people handle it bette than others.

The main actors are Drew Matthews (the falsely accused son); Francine Locke (the mother); Kelsi Chandler (the daughter-in-law); and Cameron Arnett (the brilliant defense lawyer). But do not watch this movie if you insist on perfection when it comes to the films you watch. There are no Oscar nominations waiting to be announced. Some of the lines, especially those taken from the real story, sound corny and no award-seeking writer would ever have proposed them. I felt the music did not always fit the scene and was quite disjointed. But once you get over these expectations that you are accustomed to, you will find a gem from reality  and most often real life is more awkward than how Hollywood portrays it. Here is a low budget film with a great message. You can knock it or you can ask yourself, Am I prepared to go through what Jackie Carpenter went through? And what if in my case, the results were different? Would I survive  my faith, my family, myself?

The movie was issued in 2014 by Triple Horse Studios and distributed in 2015 by Phase 4 Films.  It is now available on DVD.  Watch it alone, with your spouse, and even with your teenagers.

It was also such an encouragement to see the son speak the truth even though the odds seemed against him. As for the mother, we see that she fights to the point of exhaustion and realizes she needs to let go, listen, and let God. A place where God desires all of us to be. We carry such heavy burdens that He alone can carry. His yoke is easy and His burden is light. Jason, on the other hand, spoke the truth and the truth set him free (John 8:32)- by the grace of God. Speaking the truth is difficult  when it could hurt us. However, when Gods people are praying, ""no matter what the outcome"" He says, ""I will never leave or forsake thee.""  Such powerful reminders in a world where truth needs to be spoken and heard.  Go Francine Locke & Drew Mathews- you are an amazing Christian Actors.

We were laughing and crying every time we watched it. I can relate to this mother wanting to protect her son, but she feels completely helpless when he is falsely accused of murder. When she tries to take matters into her own hands instead of waiting and trusting in God, things begin to spiral out of control and she even nearly loses her own life. But, when her other son has a message from God for her to stay in the book of Psalms and she obeys and trusts God, then she sees that God begins to work miracles. It is a wonderful message for us to learn that when we are in the right, we should stand our ground and lean on God for guidance. We must trust God and stay in His Word and things will always work out in His perfect timing. This is one of our favorite movies. I am on the edge of my seat every time I watch it.

8698822,1,B00SL9CWQC,"A deeply dishonest and manipulative film that panders to people ready to ignore Jason Veitch's clear and self-admitted guilt as long as the right notes of Christianity and class and racial conflict are struck. Artistically, however, it's somewhat impressive how Jackie Carpenter manages to make the murder of an innocent man and the trial of his killer into a story about herself and her delusion that she caused a ""miracle"" acquittal by carrying a Bible.
A few key points to know:
1.  The film has Veitch go out to the woods with a shotgun, a cell phone, and a flashlight. In reality, Veitch admits that he carried two guns and a package of plastic zip ties intended as improvised flex-cuffs.
2.  The film has attorney Kane explaining to the jury that Veitch had no duty to retreat on his land because Georgia has a ""Stand Your Ground"" law. That's nonsense. SYG provisions change *only* the duty to retreat--the SYG provision wouldn't make it legal to shoot someone with a shotgun unless the other criteria of self-defense were met--ability, opportunity, jeopardy--and a reasonable person would reasonably have been in fear for his life or grave bodily harm unless he used deadly force. Veitch had the right to argue exactly *none* of those elements, because Veitch claimed he shot and killed the man by accident, not in self-defense.  No, ""I was in fear for my life and I didn't want to shoot but the gun just went off by accident"" is not a claim of self-defense.
3.  The film depicts the prosecutors as the bad guys, but shows them correctly explaining how the law really works and why it's not OK to point shotguns at people who aren't threatening someone with deadly force themselves. The film depicts Veitch's lawyer as a folksy man of wisdom, but shows him lying to the jury about the facts and the law repeatedly.",1505520000,,1821,4.735015772870662
8698823,4,B00SL9CWQC,"This movie had a fabulous story line.  What was annoying was that the story seemed to focus more on the MOTHER than the son.  That said, when a loved one goes through a trial in life whether it be an actual criminal trial, an illness, etc., the mother does suffer watching her child go through a traumatizing experience.  Being a mother I could totally relate to that, but again, I did find the story a bit annoying because it focused more on her than the son though.  For sure, the one actually enduring the trial suffers most of all above all others, so I feel that they should have dialed the mother aspect back a bit.

Overall good movie, family friendly... I would say it is probably most appropriate for the 12 & older crowd since it does show a shooting & replays it.  Though by today's standards & all of the vile filth on TV, in video games, etc. I would say this is suitable for all ages as far as most parents are concerned, but I am NOT like most parents so I would say if you are actually cautious about what your child watches, you may want to preview it first to see if it is appropriate for your younger child or watch it w/remote in hand to stop it if it will be upsetting to your child.
4 stars- took 1 off for the over focusing on the mother.",1500595200,,1261,4.1687242798353905
