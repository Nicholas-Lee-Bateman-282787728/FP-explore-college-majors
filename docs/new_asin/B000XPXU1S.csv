Viewing both back to back makes the adulation completely understandable. He certainly has plenty of tricks up his sleeves. So many ideas, methods, concepts.... Our film professor made us watch both of them in successive days.",1466553600,,366,5.116666666666666
8229041,3,B000XPXU1S,"I saw this movie on PBS and it haunted me for days. The film is shot in black-and-white in late winter Minnesota. The film has a bleak, tragic feel to it. Vic (Alex Cole) is a middle-aged, foul-mouthed, caustic antiques dealer who obsesses over space dolls and making contact with aliens. He softens, however, when he meets a 27-year-old woman named Cassie (Catherine E. Johnson). She has a booth at the same fleamarket where Vic peddles his wears. She's trying to sell two crudely made dolls. Cassie seems like a vulerable, naive sort of person, and it's hinted that she may have had a troubled past. These two misfits form a friendship, and Vic confides in Cassie about his attempts to contact aliens. His tracker goes off when she comes to his trailer and he assumes this means that the aliens want to meet Cassie for some reason.

What this film is really about is the danger of obsession. Vic is obsessed with making contact with aliens, while Cassie is secretly romantically obsessed with Vic (though Vic is unaware of this and dismisses her as a ""kid."") Both their obsessions lead to tragedy.

I won't give anything away, but I will say that Cole and Johnson, in the two leads, give complex, intriguing performances. Though Cole's character can be rude and selfish, the actor still makes him somewhat sympathetic to the audience. And Johnson does wonderful work as the damaged and vulnerable Cassie.

This film is for lovers of independent films. If you love slick, formula Hollywood films, skip this. This is a quiet character study, not a special effects movie.",1201392000,4,1570,4.785977859778598
8229042,5,B000XPXU1S,"This is the best film that I have seen in many years.  I can't stop thinking about the ending--it is absolutely stunning!  The film is both funny and tragic, and it is totally unpredictable.  The dialogue is very clever and witty, and the acting is terrific--the two main characters are very believable and seem very real.  I also loved the black and white cinematography and the haunting music.",1201046400,4,395,4.764705882352941
8229043,5,B000XPXU1S,"It would be easy for an unenlightened filmgoer dulled by the bombast of Hollywood to refuse to see beneath the extremely modest surface of ""Two Harbors"" and miss the subtly powerful and moving performances by Catherine E. Johnson and Alex Cole, two unknown (at least to me) actors whose work I will now seek out. They seem to have found the perfect style to match a film that, if you're willing to stay with it through every twist and genre bend, will take you to a place where few films of any budget dare to go. Did I mention genre? Don't ask me what genre ""Two Harbors"" is, because I don't think the genre exists, and that's another nice thing about it. It goes its own way, and with its own style. If more films like ""Two Harbors"" were made...well, I doubt that another film like ""Two Harbors"" COULD be made. I loved it.",1201046400,,824,4.357142857142857
8229044,2,B000XPXU1S,"""Two Harbors"" is an independent film (a really independent film), made on a budget of about $10,000, and it shows. But the basic problems with the film lie outside any considerations of the film's poor visual quality. First off, the story, although based on actual events, is weak and poorly written. It is an interesting story - just not well constructed or developed.

Secondly, the characters just don't behave in a believable fashion, or in a way that offers any genuine psychological insights into their characters. The main character, Vic, a dealer in ""space toys"" (a term he detests) and an amateur alien investigator, is simply not psychologically real. He starts off as this brash, rude, cynical type, and then appears as this naive alien investigator, and the film makes no attempt to reconcile these 2 halves of his personality.

Carrie, the girl whom Vic meets, sells dolls at the same antiques market where Vic has a booth. She is definitely a strange girl and acts so from the beginning, so her oddities of behavior are believable. Vic, on the other hand, seems to be two characters meshed together. The film definitely could have used more character development.

The film is amateurish, and at first I only watched it because I never see such poorly-made films in which the acting is so raw/bad, although it may be less the fault of the actors than the poorly written script. The dialogue is often unintentionally funny, although there are these moments where the film shows this quirky sense of humor, which is more annoying and cliched than funny.

There are so many problems with this film - poor writing, acting, and directing. So many of the shots are so clumsily constructed, and it looks like a film school student's movie (black and white, cheesy slo-mo flashbacks, quirky, lonely characters, etc), although it is of slightly higher quality than most such films.

Nevertheless, I would recommend the film, because the story is haunting and rather unique, and these authentically indie films are fascinating in their depiction of ordinary life and their raw acting and dialogue. In the end, though, the interesting story is failed by the clumsy production values and a poor script.",1200873600,,2204,4.945945945945946
