I am aware of the LDS view of homosexuality from a couple of books,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Fall/dp/1934531812/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Fall</a>, by James Buchanan (a woman), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Going-Back/dp/0978797191/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Going Back</a>, by a father of three and author of a Mormon encyclopedia. Hard Fall tells the story of a park ranger in Mormon country who consorts with a young drifter-rock climber and gets in dutch with the LDS bishop when a colorful 2-way radio exchange between the two is overheard, and No Going Back is about a gay teen who comes clean about his homosexuality with his straight best friend and his friend's bishop father, but gets the LDS third degree anyway. (Read my reviews of both books.)

Here the intent of both young men is to serve the LDS church and their families to the best of their abilities, but, through some realistic, unforeseen, stressful events, their mutual reserves are breached, and they become more to each other than missionary partners. The story could be autobiographical.

As with Latter Days, the narrator is put through the ringer, but here remains true to himself and close to his Mormon faith. And the final scene gives the audience a ray of hope that all will be well.

The soundtrack is well done. The first track is by gay singer-songwriter Jay Brannan and it fits the mood of the film at that point very well. (His new album is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rob-Me-Blind-Deluxe-Edition-Includes-Extended-Booklet-Bonus-Download-of-Live-at-Eddie-s-Attic/dp/B006YZAPOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rob Me Blind Deluxe Edition (Includes Extended Booklet + Bonus Download of Live at Eddie's Attic)</a>.)

The film gets four stars for originality and script but loses one for the age of the ""20 year old"" missionaries and the not-quite-professional acting and production. All in all The Falls has better production values than many gay films, though dialog was recorded on top of open window and road noise. It is certainly a worthwhile film, though it is clear that the LDS faith has no place for non-celebate homosexuals, and that Mormons are quite possessive of the image of missionaries -- though The PBS Frontline/American Experience&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mormons/dp/B000P5FH4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mormons</a>&nbsp;exposed the salesmanship aspect of LDS missionary training.

5282805,4,B00996RSYM,"kind of different.  i sure like the movie ""latter""  this was probably more realistic i suppose.. don't know.. not a mormon... just seems like it..",1356739200,,146,4.8
5282806,4,B00996RSYM,".....young men and their love for Jesus Christ, family, church (and, sometimes, each other) is near enthralling....and watchable again and again.

A ""Realistic Primer"" (in the film's beginning) of the daily lives of Young Couples (male, Mormon Companions) on a Mission.  In this story, we're introduced to a dorm-like setting of a simple double room, with basic kitchen.  We watch as the Companions (always staying together, as a pair) are introduced to their new commitments and goals, their rules of conduct, and submission of required progress reports.  Everything arranged for them....everything with a purpose.

((  NOTE:  We learn, in the Special Features section of this DVD, that Writer/Director, Jon Garcia, was a neophyte (newbie) to things Mormon....and had to ""study up"" on his subject (unlike C. Jay Cox, the EX-Mormon and Director of 2003's ""Latter Days""  ))

OUR CAST OF ACTORS (only the primaries):

- Actor Nick Ferrucci, as R. J. Smith.  (I call him:  ""He Who Bringeth Out Joy"").  Playing a young 20-year old Man on a Mission (2 years long), we follow him from film beginning to end.  And at the start he informs us:  ""Mormon Faith truly is a benefactor of wholesomeness.""  BUT...the question later becomes:  can R. J. stick to that belief?  At any rate, here is a good time to point out that he is our Hug-Guy--some Accomplishments deserve one. And if there is any such thing as a ""Light-Hearted"" Mormon Missionary, R. J. often comes close.  You'll recognize this later on as he backtalks his Companion, Chris, in an effort to get him to ""lighten up"" and into a better mood.

- Actor Benjamin Farmer, as Chris Merril.  (I call him:  ""He Who Maketh the First Move""). As R. J.s Mormon Companion and Senior Elder, Chris has been on other missions (there, perhaps, is the rub).  A sometimes fervent young man, Elder Chris is our Serious one.  But, it won't take you long to realize that things have begun to rankle this Missionary.  He's begun ""to question"".

- Actor Brian Allard, as Rodney.  (I call him:  ""He Who Enlightenth Our Lives"").  Plays a pot-smoking, ex-Iraq war vet, with much of a PTSD personality (or maybe not....he could be our sanest character).  Despite his truly horrible experience in that war zone, he will have you absolutely rolling off your seats laughing when he is at his best.  He's lovable...he's understanding.  And frankly, he could be the best thing which happens to our R. J. and Chris.

Despite all we learn about the Mormon Religion (and it's not always Christ-like), make no mistake about what I say next:  ....THIS IS, AT ITS ROOT, A LOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO MEN.  And so, as the story edges to its end, we find R. J. experiencing increasingly caring thoughts (and concerns) for his withdrawn Companion, Chris. Which then leads to a series of notable events:

- A diner table discussion, between our Companions, of R. J.s concern over Chris slackening off....resulting in a surprise, Hand-Touching-Hand moment. Which then leads to:

- An accusation of ""Faggotry"" against them....resulting in a fight by R. J. in protecting themselves. Which then leads to:

- Bruised knuckles....resulting in Hand-Holding, in the applying of an ice pack (a nice little moment). Which then leads to:

- Exhaustion and early drop off into sleep by Chris....leaving R. J. to prepare for bed, say his prayers and, then, to gaze at a sleeping Chris, before turning out the light. For me, this is THE point at which I knew Love existed between them. We can see it in R. J.s face....we can see it in his eyes. It is ""The Defining Moment"".

This film also contains an absolutely heart-rending denouement (outcome) scene between R. J. and his church Stake President.  It is one of the strongest performances you will see by a young actor.  While it will tear at your heart....it is NOT an apology scene and is extremely well written.....leaving us the possibility of hope for our two young men.  Will the moments later Final Scene confirm that for us?

Memorable Moments:  A Bus-ride Kiss.  In fact, every kiss these actors bring to one another....seems real...seems meant.  How rare!

PS--Production values are quite high for this Indie Film.  Particular mention is deserved for the wonderful film score, music and lyrics.  Made up of very simple piano, guitar and vocal harmonics, this score will absolutely grab you.  A musical standout for me was the near film end ""Coda of Discovery"" (they are found out).

5282807,4,B00996RSYM,The story starts out with two serious mind LDS boys doing their mission.  They meet a man with whom they have dinner and he challenges their thinking.  Doubts begin to set in for both of them and secret desire begin to surface.  They act on their desires and start to abandon their mission.  Their world falls apart.  This is a very quiet movie that focuses on the two main characters.  I enjoyed how the movie allowed to see the character development from religious zealots to questioning what they believed about themselves and God.  It would be great to see a sequel to see how their lives changed.,1356134400,2,601,4.5607476635514015
5282808,4,B00996RSYM,"It takes about 45 minutes or so for the dynamics between these two Mormon missionaries to blossom into a same sex attraction, so if you are willing to stick with it for that long, there is a good payoff.  The acting is very natural, almost as if you are watching a documentary rather than a scripted film.  Sensitive tale of forbidden love.",1355875200,,340,4.467741935483871
5282809,5,B00996RSYM,"""The Falls"" had the potential to be exploitative and inflammatory, considering its dual subjects: Mormons and homosexuality. Thankfully, it is neither. Credit is due to writer and director Jon Garcia, who deftly navigates a minefield of controversy to create a moving story of one young missionary's personal journey. It is a journey that is admittedly hard to capture in two hours, so this telling is, of a necessity, elliptical.

Mormons will view this film in a completely different light than non-Mormons, despite the director's care in trying not to offend potential audiences. A touching film about two missionaries is not the same thing as a film about two missionaries touching.

Garcia firmly believes that he has made the former: the story of a personal journey and finding love. A film that is respectful of the religion that makes that love fraught with difficulty. And indeed he has.

What I don't think he understands is that most devout Mormons will see the latter: a profane, sacrilegious exploitation of one of the proudest products of the Church--its missionaries. Garcia, who took great pains to learn about the Church, even so far as taking the missionary lessons and attending services for months (with no pretense), can't fully appreciate one peculiarity about Mormons.

Ever since 1838, when Governor Lilburn W. Boggs of Missouri issued the infamous ""Extermination Order"" to shoot any Mormon within the state on sight, Latter-Day Saints have lived with a siege mentality: it's us against the world. (This was most recently evident in the campaign of Mitt Romney.) Mormons are suspicious of any outsider who tries to portray their faith. They seek to influence, control, and even orchestrate such portrayals in most cases to assure that they and their faith are not disparaged.

Missionaries are to devout Mormons what servicemen are to patriotic Americans: they are heroes beyond reproach, at least while they are serving. The Mormon discomfort with Garcia's film will stem not so much from the subject of homosexuality, which most Mormons are now aware exists among even their devoutest members, but the fact that a less-than-sacred portrait of the Church's missionaries has been painted for all the world to see.

The Mormons' problem with this film and Garcia's triumph are one and the same: the brutal honesty of the story. Missionaries are not all angels. And they are not all the self-assured messengers of the Gospel that they attempt to be, sometimes with great personal struggle. But Garcia exposes the weaknesses of his characters lovingly. He does not belittle them or shame them or parade them as evidence of Mormonism's failure.

Having served as a Mormon missionary myself, and knowing at the time that I was gay, I see both sides of this dilemma. (I, too, have written about such experiences in one of my novels.) I understand the Mormon discomfort and the belief that, while some missionaries struggle with their sexual feelings, to indulge them WHILE serving a mission is a disgrace, never mind what happens afterward. But I also understand Garcia's message that it takes a brave and self-assured person, missionary or no, to stand up to such a formidable force as one's faith and family combined, and say ""I am not ashamed of who I am.""",1355788800,84,3277,5.046210720887246
5282810,5,B00996RSYM,I enjoyed this movie. It is such a typical story of growing up gay in the church. These young men finally figure out you can't undo what God created in you. It is a sweet story with no overtly sexual content.,1355788800,29,208,4.097560975609756
5282811,3,B00996RSYM,At last we have a gay  film that has a  very well written and intelligent screenplay. No cliched characters like most gay films. The acting is  exceptionally good - another plus. There are some minor  flaws however. There is no hint of  the characters being gay until  just over half way through the movie. Some  hints would  have helped. The gay bashing scene does not give  you any idea  as to who won as the scene  has a beginning but  then it suddenly  cuts to the  bashed guy at  home. It is however  well worth  seeing as decent gay films are  extremely rare from the USA.,1355529600,7,578,4.2924528301886795
5282812,4,B00996RSYM,"Ricky (""RJ"") Smith is a 20 year old who is interrupting his college studies to fulfill his Mormon missionary obligation.  He is paired with Chris Merrill, also 20, who has already been at that work for a while, and the duo is expected to spend every moment of the day and night together.  As is the custom, RJ must follow Chris' lead, as he is the more experienced of the two, and RJ respects that, which makes it more difficult for him to understand when Chris loses control when they are verbally attacked by a potential convert who challenges the Church's stand on polygamy. RJ also must take charge when they encounter a couple of homophobic rednecks who hate Mormons.

It is not until later in the movie that it is established that both RJ and Chris had been repressing feelings that they could be gay, and the closeness between the two eventually develops into a loving, physical relationship ...  one that, if it is discovered, could force then from the church and possibly alienate them from their families.

This film has been compared to ""Latter Days,"" another film about a gay Mormon missionary, but is actually quite different, on several levels. It seems more realistic to me, in depicting the mindset of the two young men as they face a life-changing decision. The cast of mostly unknown actors performs well, and - except for some issues with dialogue being drowned out by background music and noise - the production values are good.

My advance screener copy did not have the additional ""Making of..."" featurette (which is the norm for screeners), but surprisingly also had no credits, either opening or closing.  I assume all are included in the DVD release on December 11th.  Four stars out of five.",1353801600,15,1717,4.738255033557047

The Falls trilogy provides the space to cover with depth and subtlety the difficulties all too many encounter accepting themselves and being open about it, especially when their social surroundings (family, friends, location, religion, etc) make the process more difficult than it need be. Thanks to everyone involved for The Falls' thoughtful depiction of the subject.

Nevertheless, I found them all captivating, probably some of the best acting I have seen in a long.time in a straight or gay movie. No movie can be perfect although I respect the opinions of others about this movie. It reminds me of a stage setting I did many years ago. I had made the whole design but various friends and patrons said ""if only"" I had done such and such it would have been perfect or at least better, whatever. My point, I would hate to come up with problems with these three masterful efforts. I was especially impressed with Nick Ferrucci's scene at the end as he justified his being as a gay man.

I was a gay Mormon missionary in the 1980s, and this felt pretty authentic to me.  I could almost see it happening back in that time, and now I suppose young gay Mormons are more exposed to the possibility of being gay - they've seen it more often around them in their lives.

In my heart I'd give it 5 stars, but I know there are issues with music, lighting, and sound that a micro indie just can't address.

5282920,5,B00996RSYM,"There is a curious thing that happens when faith meets flesh. The Falls follows the lives of two Mormon missionaries, RJ and Chris as they attempt to reconcile their religious beliefs with their homosexuality. The Falls is oft compared to another movie about homosexuality and Mormonism, Latter Days. While Latter Days is a great movie, The Falls takes the themes of religion and sexuality a bit further. Not only do we get to see the struggles of both RJ and Chris, we get to see the reactions of their respective families. The Falls does a great job of tastefully depicting the Mormon faith, the good, the bad, the ugly. While the ending is left rather open ended as to the fates of both RJ and Chris, the best part is that there is a sequel that is just as good, if not better. If you're looking for a great story, compelling characters and some good old fashioned romance, I highly suggest checking out The Falls. It is truly one of the better LGBT-themed films.

5282933,5,B00996RSYM,"**There may be spoilers**
I actually saw this on Netflix, since it's free there, but I felt compelled to leave feedback here, because the feedback system is robust here.
In four words:  I loved this movie.  As another reviewer stated, I didn't think that I would.  There are countless movies that show the collision of faith with sexuality, usually with sexuality winning out.  Why would this one be any different?  Before I go further, let's have a little background here.
PLOT
We encounter two missionaries:  RJ and Chris.  RJ is the neophyte; hes going on his first mission.  Chris is experienced, as hes been serving on his mission already.  Both come from solid Mormon families, though Chriss family is more high-profile than RJs.
After they meet and get to know each other, they each start to show vulnerability.  This means that RJ shows that, despite having been a high-school wrestler, hes a sensitive guy.  This also means that what is an initially stoic Chris is actually someone who loves his religiosity but who turns out to be frustrated that others don't embrace the Christian god the way that they should.  Its in this sharing of each others vulnerabilities that they build a strong connection.
This connection is at once beautiful, resembling the fulsome love that is supposed to emanate from their god.  Its a forgiving love, a love that allows people to look past each others faults and focus on the one thing that makes them attractive.
But this is also a dangerous love, since if it is discovered by the church, it can mean the figurative end of both of their lives.  I am a former Mormon, and I can attest that the oppressive level of peer pressure you see in here really does exist.  There are expectations to serve on a mission, come home and get married, and have three or more kids.  When you don't want to follow that formula, the excoriation and shunning begin.  But thats what makes this connection so beautiful.  It forges on despite the significant threats to the lives of the lovers.
I won't go into details other than to say that there isn't a solid ending to this movie.  Keep watching, and youll see what I am talking about.
ACTING
With the exception of RJs mother, its credible, with the standout being Chris, who clearly has training and experience.  There are times when RJs acting does require you to strain a little to connect with him, but I think this is more because he seems like a stiff person in real life rather than someone not knowing how to play the role effectively.
When you do research, you find out that both actors are straight.  Thats important to know, because the scenes of strong intimacy in here feel real.  You really believe that you're observing two star-crossed lovers who are interested in pleasing the other.  They kiss passionately.  They look longingly into each others eyes.  They caress each other lovingly.  It was as if this type of romance was natural forthem.
Although he didn't have a major role in the movie, the mission leaderI think hes named Marshalldoes a smashing good job.  When you initially see him, hes escorting RJ to the apartment where hell be staying with Chris.  The moment you lay eyes on the guy, you can see that hes ultra-religious, nave, and an outright snitch.  Hes also an uber-geek.  Unless you're talking about the travails of Joseph Smith, its clear you cant trust him with any secret.  Hell rat you out in four seconds.
CONCLUSION
What you walk away from this movie with is a connection with the protagonists.  You also walk away with sorrow in your heart based on how things turned out.  Situations get bleak pretty quickly, and the actors subjugate themselves to the bleakness in order to turn in a credible performance.  You walk away wondering how things ultimately turned out.  You walk away as confused as RJ and Chris are about where they stand in their faith.  You walk away with more questions than you have answers.
This movie had every opportunity to turn into a clichd gay-religious movie, relying on tired tropes to get its message across.  While there are similarities to other gay movies of the same genre, this one uses the good acting skills of everyone to deliver the film from the trash bin to one thats put on repeat in your watch list.
This is a definite recommend.  Just make sure when you sit down to watch, you have time to devote and won't be distracted.  There are subtleties in this one that, if missed, can make the rest of the movie confusing.
Note:  There is an iteration to this film; its called The Falls:  Testament of Love.  If you want to find out RJ and Chriss disposition at the end of the first movie, check this one out.  The acting is even better, and the plot is just as engaging.",1442016000,4,4722,4.63855421686747

5282942,5,B00996RSYM,"Well, since Amazon can't seem to tell the difference between parts of a trilogy, and has all but forced me to review The Falls: Convenant of Grace INSIDE MY REVIEW OF THE FIRST TWO FILMS...here goes:

From the moment I heard that Jon Garcia and crew were attempting to put together funding for the third part of this trilogy, I have been waiting patiently to see what would happen. Well, they completed it, and I have to say that as a fan of the first two installments, I found this wrap up to be sweet, loving, and everything I'd hoped it would be.

As with the first two films, the writing and acting in this segment are excellent, and as I have come to love both of these main characters, warts and all, I was wanting to see them at the altar, exchanging vows, whether or not their beloved LDS was allowing an ""official"" ceremony or not.

What made this entire trilogy so good was that as the love between these two characters was explored and allowed to grow, it became a force of nature -- and a force of God. We knew, even when each of the first two installments did not end with our two favorite Mormons in each other's arms -- that they would one day find their way into that embrace.

Mr. Garcia was very careful not to allow this film to become too maudlin or sappy; instead he provided us with enough realistic twists and turns, that it felt very much like a relationship any of us might have been in. There were obstacles, both those presented by man, and those of a higher nature (as interpreted by man)...but happily they were all overcome.

I gave this last installment a bit of a higher rating than the first two, only because I am now looking at all three films as basically one entity: one story that began slowly and evolved into the loving embrace that writers, cast and crew provided us with; quite a nice Christmas present for fans of the trilogy.

Review of The Falls and The Falls: Testament of Love

Both The Falls and the sequel are well done stories about two Mormon missionaries who are challenged by their nature to be themselves and express the love they have for one another -- or stand with the doctrines of their church, and deny who they are.

The first film does a good job of building up to where the two finally act on the feelings they have for one another. The production quality is good, and the acting makes you believe that these two are meant to be together.

All in all, a good romantic film for those who enjoy m/m romance stories. However, don't look for a Happy Ever After in this film, because it's not here. It doesn't end badly, just not as some of us had hoped.",1425081600,,2612,4.347022587268994

I gotta  say the  chemistry  is pretty amazing - particularly in the sequel.  I  was  annoyed by the  Variety review.

5282961,5,B00996RSYM,"I have watched so many sloppy LGBTQ themed movies that I practically beg for a good one to come along.  My prayers were answered.  The Falls is not only a well acted movie, it is well written and has great production values.  Something I rarely see unless it is a big budget Hollywood film.  The two main characters have much in common, controlling parents, controlling religion, sexual confusion.  This plot line has been used before in other movies which I enjoyed and which tended to be a bit more campy.  RJ and Chris seem like two clean cut guys on the surface with a hidden desire below that facade.  Eventually they explore their sexual feelings and then get outed by a fellow member of their church. The sex scenes are handled very well...the kissing is urgent and frantic the way young and sexually frustrated people tend to be.  The rest of the sexual acts are alluded to without making this movie to be about sex as is about forbidden desire. The heart of the story isn't the sexual attraction between the two but how they handle their love for each other when outed and shamed by their family's and their religion.  Luckily a part two of this movie was made to deal with exactly that.... in The Falls: Testament of Love.  I must admit that I watched both movies back to back twice, two days in a row.  I sincerely hope the writer decides to make a part three.  It is a terrific story line that can go in many directions.",1420329600,,1432,4.444444444444445
5282962,5,B00996RSYM,"This film is a little odd. Having grown up in Utah--not Mormon but surrounded by them--the points made about the LDS church are entirely valid. The movie showcases how closedmindeded Mormons can be, some of their unique practices, and conveys the pressures put upon young men to live a certain life--or fail the family.

There's no cheesiness to the storyline at all.  It's all so very raw, and the actors do a very good job in making the viewer believe that 1)They are in love, and 2) Their vulnerabilities and the struggles they face in embracing their feelings for each other while still needing and wanting to follow what their religious faith has taught them.

Once you know the main idea, what happens is not too much of surprise.  While it's a great story, the movie feels like it's lacking enough of a story. The ending was proper, yet I feel like it needed more to be that much more.  Rather than have two DVDs, I suspect the two DVDs should have been put together as one story.  Also, when sparks start to fly, it seems a bit contrived.  I'm not sure how they could make that part seem more natural (to me.)

5283053,4,B00996RSYM,"My first introduction to Mormonism in film, theater, or television was the wonderful Mormon mother in Tony Kushner's outstanding ""Angels in America.""  Next came ""Latter Day,"" a somewhat less sensitive treatment of this topic - though the actor who played the Mormon in that one was outstanding.  Now we have two films - this and the recent ""Testament of Love"" - that create a fascinating story arc between two characters.  Nick Ferrucci shines especially in the first, and Ben Farmer's acting is just stunning in the second.  Spoiler alert:  when Ben's wife finds out he is gay, it's natural to expect a bit of ""Brokeback Mountain with Mormons,"" but the actress convey the complications with realism and fewer histrionics.  The filmmaker took pains to portray the Mormon church perhaps too fairly, and the first film puts a rare, little-seen focus on what Mormon missionaries actually do with their time (though these two Mormon missionaries do go a bit outside the range of what most Mormons likely would do).  Just a suggestion, guys - if you do a third film (and the first two set the stage for that possibility), how about including a researched special feature that gives us the number of gay Mormons who have committed suicide as a result of excommunication from the church, family, and friends?  Or the amount of money the church has wasted on fighting gay marriage in Hawaii, California, and other states?  As a pair of movies, these are entertaining, even ground-breaking, filled with scenes of intimacy, passion, great writing, and great acting.  But the fact that our two gay Mormons make it through both films without being excommunicated from the church?  Only in the movies.",1405296000,3,1688,4.950354609929078
5283054,1,B00996RSYM,"The first half of the movie is all about the Mormon routine and the subtle cracks in their armor of faith that form over time. That said, the pacing naturally feels a lot slower than the rest of the movie as we too get sucked into their daily routine of waking up early, saying their prayers and trying to give out pamphlets to passers by. This part of the movie is not done in a manner that passes judgement for or against the Mormon faith - it just seems to present it as is and leaves it to the audience to form their own opinions.

Things naturally shift when the two give into their feelings and start exploring their sexuality together. We don't go as far as them suddenly dressing in a flamboyant manner or hitting the nearest gay club - all of which are pretty ridiculous alternatives. However we do have them practically showing of in front of one of the folks they were unable to convert.

You know that the religious angle has to come back around to bite them in the butt - it seems to be a requirement for any gay movie with strong religious themes. And in this regard there's still the confrontation, but I didn't feel like there was a strong resolution to things. Perhaps it was an effort not to seem to be attacking the Mormon religion too harshly. But given that it really doesn't take a stand - just has these two young men struggling with their feelings in contrast to their religion.

The Falls is heavy, but not in a cerebral, fulfilling way. It has some light moments, but not enough to offset the often dragging pace of things It has moments of intimacy that are neither titillating nor all that endearing. The whole movie simply just...is.",1403740800,,1662,4.42483660130719
5283055,5,B00996RSYM,"I saw this film last evening for the first time.  I was a missionary who served honorably for two years back in the 70s and found the many scenes truthful and inspiring.  I, too, am a Gay man who finally found a way out of the church to be myself.  It was not easy.  I was told to marry and have children to have a ""cure"" for my ""homo"" disease.  I did what that priesthood leaders told me, but I finally could not be false to myself any longer.  I am now in a beautiful gay relationship going on 26 years.  We are getting married in San Francisco for our celebrated relationship.  I urge any who see this film to understand that it is NOT easy, but it is well worth it.  Mormons! Mormons!, where ever you are:  If you are gay, please come out of the closet and set yourself free and be yourself.  I highly recommend it!  I am no longer bitter about the church, but I see it as part of my ""truth.""  These people are my people and they always will be.  I am proud to be a gay ex-Mormon who is the 5th generation of Mormons who fought and struggled to be who they are since Joseph Smith's vision in a grove of trees in upstate NY in 1820.  I can't change facts, only embrace them. After the last installment of THE FALLS: COVENANT OF GRACE, I love the final scene of Chris and R.J. standing, holding hands as the diaphanous white curtains blew gracefully around them.  Chris in full garments, R.J. without a top.  I just wish that the Mormon Church would accept same sex marriage, but they will never do it.  They are kinder, but they still will NEVER accept us.  This fictional story rang true to me on so many levels.  The last of this trilogy was the most weak, but the message was clear.  The two main actors and the director did all they could with this storyline.  Bravo!

Good luck to all.

5283056,5,B00996RSYM,"""The Falls""  is far from being an epic.  At least in the Star Wars, Gone with the Wind, Doctor Zhivago sense.  It doesn't have to be.  It portrays in a quiet, subtle, serious way a forbidden love and its outcome within a restrictive and--dare I say it?--almost incomprehensible environment of sanctioned religious lack of understanding and organized bigotry. The LDS's refusal to comprehend the realities of divergent sexual feelings is a true insult and affront toward the all-encompassing love of Jesus Christ.

Other reviewers have given the film positive reviews, with maybe a negative comment about this or that presumed flaw. That's good.  The acting is nonetheless excellent for two budding, novice actors (to whom I offer a heartfelt hope that both  may achieve success in a profession that is, by all accounts, a cutthroat business.  Nick Ferrucci, portraying RJ, indeed has a deadpan delivery.  But I think it is a studied delivery based on his interpretation of the character's essential vocational seriousness. And Benjamin Farmer's Chris is subdued yet deeply emotional and conflicted. And Brian Allard is enchanting as the pot-smoking friend who accepts RJ and Chris unconditionally.

I have not yet seen the sequel ""Testament of Love.""  I have it coming from a supplier.  This first movie is wonderful and the actors perform with grace, humility, doubt, and dignity.  For a gay audience it is a revelation of what beautiful feelings, Godlike feelings, that fill a vacuum gays have always been hoping to see and vicariously experience.",1398211200,,1549,5.172690763052209

5283058,5,B00996RSYM,"Just finished watching ""The Falls"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
Before proceeding, I must make a full disclosure here.  [No Greg Appelt, I didn't sleep with any Mormon missionaries.]  Nearly 11 years ago, I had the chance to have a series of very interesting one-on-two meetings with two Mormon Elders - Elder Dalahanse and Elder Butler at the Barnes & Noble nearby.  There is a photo here on my Facebook page that  President Green took of me with both of them.  While I suspected and still do that Elder Dalahanse and Elder Butler were trying for the ""Ah-Ha"" moment in attempting to convert a stalwart Jew to Mormonism - wasn't and still ain't happening Elders; I still have the Book of Mormon in which they wrote of their love for me.  I also still have the oragami scorpion they gave me neatly tucked away in one of my bookcases.  [Regina Stebbins - a former co-worker of mine didn't like the fact that they gave me a scoprion and wanted me to have absolutely nothing to do with them after that.]
""The Falls"" is quiet and understated story telling at its best.  Both RJ and Chris are compelling characters who respond in unexpected ways when confronted with the religious fallout when their intense relationship is discovered and outed.
While Elder Dalahanse was happy and pleased that I considered then, and still do, ""The Book of Mormon"" to be a holy book - it is to Mormon's what the Koran is to Musilms - I think my favorite line in this whole movie is:  ""We're bad Mormons, aren't we?""
RJ and Chris must answer that question themselves separately when the Mormon Church threatens to ex-communicate them.
Highly Recommended!

Directed and written by Jon Garcia.
  R.J. Smith (Nick Ferrucci), a Mormon in Idaho, is on his way to a missionary in Oregon. He had a girlfriend, but has only given her a kiss on the cheek twice. At the missionary, he meets his roommate Chris Merrill (Benjamin Farmer) from Salt Lake City, Utah. Elder Merrill has been in missionary so long, it is all he does.
  The next day, they wake up, pray, exercise, jog outside and read scriptures. They get Elder Smith a bike and begin meeting people. They get called every name in the book on a daily basis. This only brings R.J. and Chris closer together...and even more closer.

Also in the cast: Quinn Allan, Brian Allard, Justin Koleszar, Harold Phillips, Audrey Walker.

Brief male nudity.

Filmed in Portland, Oregon.

5283075,5,B00996RSYM,"This movie does what all art should, tell truth by using a beautiful lie.  The truth it tells should not be considered gay or queer because it is universal, i.e. that love is powerful and who one loves does not change who they are but gives further depth.  Obviously if gay themes disturb you, by all means pass this by; however, you will be missing one of the truly great moments of cinematic truth telling I have seen in a long time.  The climax of this film is a speech made by the protagonist/narrator and although speaking to an invisible character does so facing the camera, looking directly at the audience.  The emotions are so pure, the acting so flawless that it would seem that the words were his own.  And in that one moment, with all that the movie built up right onto that moment... it would be difficult to remain dry-eyed.
And to show that I'm not just some talking head for the director or something here's my biggest criticism, the opening of the movie uses about 4 musical themes in as many minutes as it tries to quickly sum up the background and the musical selection becomes jarring if not outright distracting.  A second opinion should have been sought when editing that part.",1388707200,,1199,4.527777777777778
5283076,5,B00996RSYM,If you have not watched Latter Days then you better. The Falls rates right up there with it. We have The Falls Testament of Love but have not had the chance to watch it.

It is well done by the directors and cast and will leave viewers desiring to see where R.J. and Chris go next.

Yet I know nothing has changed. If you have ever been around Mormon missionaries , you may realize that RJ is playing the part of boring and bland exactly right.

5283080,4,B00996RSYM,"Straightforward staging, honest characters and credible interactions and dialogue make this a thoroughly enjoyable film.  The story of two, 20-year old Mormon men doing their missionary service in Oregon who find themselves attracted to each other with no way to reconcile their feelings without violating their church's teachings.  The soul-searching is wholly believable and the outcomes equally so.

The two lead actors are pretty close to perfect in their roles--making the viewer understand their dilemma and hoping for the best possible outcome.  Secondary characters are often equally strong--particularly an Iraq army vet who serves as a kind of anti-missionary for them and helps them take a step toward a different world.

Highly enjoyable, without being preachy or overly critical of religion.",1384732800,4,804,5.6115702479338845

It is unfair to compare them, because each deals with with a different reality.  The first exposes the extremes of physical and emotional cruelty the Mormons apply to young gay men in their attemps at ""conversion"" therapy.  The second details a spiritual crisis leading to the questioning of a ""religion?"" that is unyielding in its rejection of difference. Nick Ferrucci is simply stunning as the young man who is not afraid to reaffirm his right to love whomever he pleases. The movie explores the hum-drum, thoroughly monitored everyday life of young Mormon missionaries, thus making the unexpected love affair between the protagonists all the more striking.  A serious, moving story.",1374796800,,816,5.112781954887218

5283100,3,B00996RSYM,"THE FALLS isn't for everyone, and that's an understatement. A low budget film about what it's like to be a young man with the Church of Latter Day Saints (a Mormon), who after years of teaching and faith and growing up, is finally forced to come to terms with his homosexuality.

The film bypasses (thankfully) the steamier side of the relationship between two young elders of the church who find themselves attracted to (and maybe falling in love with) each other - and, instead, tries to concern itself with issues of faith and being true to yourself. It succeeds on some levels, but ultimately an average script and average acting weakens the message.

To begin with, the acting, for a low budget gay film, is first-rate.  The two leads have an incredible chemistry (something lacking in Latter Days).  The story is engrossing avoiding gay stereotypes.  Director, Jon Garcia, has done an amazing job with a difficult subject.  The ending is just begging for a sequel.

I have seen many, many gay themed films and have many in my personal collection.  This is among the best and one I will enjoy watching again and again.

It showed a courageous young man being honest with himself and his church, no matter the person al cost.
I especially was deeply moved by Elder Smith's meeting with the church leader. The actor portrayed the pent up emotions of his character beautifully,  and moved me to tears.
I really enjoyed this movie, and hope some of the mainstream community will see it, and recognize that human nature is not something for the church to control or demonize,  but to embrace and celebrate as part of God's great plan.",1357776000,,782,4.379310344827586

I very much enjoyed the scenes with the military veteran telling of how he did not mind talking about the war, and also when RJ & Chris revealed that they were involved and his reaction to them. I did not care much for how the church's reaction to dealing with issues, ( which seemed to be to pray it away ). I just enjoyed the movie very much",1527120000,,422,4.096385542168675
8537994,5,B00996RSYM,"I loved the film, having recently stumbled on it. This is a micro-budget, independent film, but the two leads are both credible in their roles as naive, but conflicted, young Mormon missionaries. RJ is a bit awkward, adding to the realism and charm.

RJ is an innocent and idealistic young man, a product of his strict upbringing. While he has known that he has gay leanings, his church has taught him that ""same sex attraction"" is a choice, and a sin. He sincerely believed his mission would turn him into a spiritual powerhouse. And that it would make him straight.

As RJ begins his mission with a more experienced companion, Chris, he soon learns that sharing the gospel is not as easy as it seems. Few people are interested in it. The days are long and boring, knocking on doors. Chris keeps his cool, showing RJ the ropes, until an ""investigator"" verbally ambushes the young men with inconsistencies about church history.

At that point, Chris has a change of heart. He suddenly begins to experience a great deal of doubt and confusion. Then the pair are physically accosted by a couple of drunken rednecks.

As the missionary companions confront a hostile world together, and an emotional bond develops. The slowly growing attraction seems natural, and makes this movie captivating.

The young men struggle against their desires, but they eventually consummate their relationship. They abandon all pretense of being on a mission, and enjoy each other's company until they are caught a few weeks later.

RJ is sent home, where he nobly informs his parents and the church leadership that he is gay, and not ashamed of it. Chris remains to finish the few remaining months of his mission due to his father's influence. The lovers are in touch by snail mail.

The ending was left deliberately ambiguous, but hopeful, as funding for a second film was uncertain. Fortunately, we get to see the lovers in two more films.
Some of the story line was a stretch. Chris was an experienced missionary by the time he confronted the investigator who accused Joseph Smith, founder of the church, of being a pedophile. By that point in his mission, he must have encountered dozens, or hundreds, of people with negative views of the church. It doesn't seem plausible that the incident would have had such an effect on him.

It didn't seem plausible that the two would just stop doing their missionary work after starting a sexual relationship without talking about it. It didn't seem realistic that they would start smoking pot with an investigator.

RJ would have been formally excommunicated, I am fairly sure, although the church view has been evolving in recent years. You can be gay. as long as you are celibate.

Despite plot holes, and occasional stilted dialogue, Ferrucci and Farmer are extremely convincing as two young men in love. Their chemistry is amazing, and the music score adds to the effect. This is a haunting and poignant tale of forbidden first love.

Don't miss it!",1526774400,,2976,4.850098619329389
8537995,5,B00996RSYM,"Beautiful film.  I actually saw Parts 2 and 3 before seeing Part 1.  I'm from Oregon too so these films are really close to my heart if only for that reason.  These two guys are outstanding actors - I know the guy who plays Chris is straight, not sure about the guy who plays RJ.  This first film was a great start to the trilogy.  When you start mixing religion and sex, especially Mormonism, your whole world can just come crashing down. And it almost does for these two guys.  But, they overcome it beautifully.  Everyone should see these films, no matter what orientation you are.",1524787200,2,584,4.452830188679245

8537997,5,B00996RSYM,"First of a trilogy about falling in love and being a gay person of faith, in this case the church of LDS. For me the first film is perhaps the weakest and a bit stilted but then again so are the characters so.... in a way this film sets the stage--- the awkwardness for the exploration of the uncomfortable truths that are revealed in the 3 films.
I think the 3 films deepen, become more complex and richer as the characters grow and become more of who they really are along their healing journey. It is one thing to come out gay in our culture and another deeper wound to have to reconcile being gay within a religious structure that condemns who you love as wrong and somehow bad. Love is love as the father of Chris comes to actually see in the final film when his son comforts his lover during a panic attack.
My heart broke over and over as I watched these films seeing the characters ride the roller coaster of emotional dishonesty and honesty as they confronted their fears, felt togetherness and separation, and explored the complexity of their sexual/cultural/family/religious milieux.
I often felt drawn into the films emotionally charged conversations so full of raw pain, honesty and truth like a vortex of feeling so powerful I could feel myself come out of a trance when the scene finished. This speaks to the power of the screenplay and the depth of speaking truths, and speaking truth to power!
May we humans continue to have our hearts broken open to more and more love!",1519344000,3,1487,4.573033707865169

Sex here is an after thought. Some will find this slow moving at first . Those who want to see how a relationship develops will well be rewarded It also shows why I want nothing to do with religon.
