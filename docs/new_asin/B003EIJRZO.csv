8395521,4,B003EIJRZO,"This 2-DVD digipack brings a splendid postmodern adaptation of Brazilian literary masterpiece, Machado de Assis's DOM CASMURRO, a realist novel from 1899. Set in the fin-de-sicle imperial Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this beautiful adaptation tells the story of Bento Santiago, defined by Californian literary theorist Helen Caldwell as ""the Brazilian Othello"".
Machado de Assis was fascinated with the theme of jealousy, and many of his novels are built on this intrigue. ""Dom Casmurro"" reflects Machado de Assis' life as a translator of Shakespeare, and also his influence from French realism, especially Honor de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert and mile Zola. In the novel, he also refers to Much Ado About Nothing, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and, most importantly, Othello.
Here, Machado de Assis shows a different version of the classical adultery: the story is told through the eyes of Bento Santiago (Bentinho), the betrayed husband. Throughout the story, the character narrates the supposed betrayal of his beloved Capitu (Capitolina, in allusion to the Roman emperor Capitolinus), a version of Desdemona, who, according to him, cheated on him with his best friend, giving birth to a son that only later he ""found out"" to be not his. However, the facts that he shows as proof are very flimsy, and could easily be interpreted as paranoia. It could be all in his imagination, though the narrator hardly considers this an option. It is a tale with an unreliable narrator, so the reader never has a direct answer to whether Capitu cheated on him, and the outcome is still one of the most discussed among Brazilian literature fans and critics.
