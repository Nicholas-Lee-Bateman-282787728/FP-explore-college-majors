2466707,4,B000CNFC44,This is a movie I watched long ago and recently watched again.  Very good romance movie. It's worth watching.,1457308800,,109,4.7368421052631575

2466709,5,B000CNFC44,I have always loved this movie.  I have 3 daughters that figure skate and I recently started skating.  I just love the interplay between the characters.  This is a great skating movie!,1457222400,5,184,4.6875
2466710,4,B000CNFC44,"This is not a great movie by any means. But it's so much fun. It's got a place in cinematic history as being the film that made popular the plot of taking an classically trained uptown girl and pairing her with a down and dirty boy as they learn to dance (on ice) together to prove to everyone that they can both exist in both worlds. Without The Cutting Edge, maybe there would be no Step Up, or the 900 movies like it.

The only difference here is that the bad boy in this one is a hockey player who has to relearn how to skate on blades with a toe pick, which leads to the line that makes this movie so memorable.

This is just one of those movies you love to watch with full knowledge the entire time that it's not a great movie. It's just fun!",1457136000,10,748,4.0134228187919465

2466737,5,B000CNFC44,"This is one of those movies you remember from time to time and think to yourself you should watch again. A couple decades passed, then lo and behold there it was on Prime. I'm a lot older now and wondered if it would age well. The answer is yes in spades. The dialog is sharp, sometimes brutal and other times witty. There are one liners sprinkled through out that you best not have anything in your mouth when they happen. And even by today's standards the production values are top notch.

But it's the characters that make this work. Everyone involved is strong and the casting choices are excellent. The biggest thing for me were the well defined and diverse personalities making very believable individuals working toward a common goal. D.B. Sweeney really comes across as the hard bitten hockey player thrust into a new reality by desperation with a partner who is erratic and can be unpredictable. His character development is subtle as the movie progresses, but he never loses the macho stubbornness of his hockey roots, for better or worse. Moira Kelly is stellar as the spoiled Ice Queen running aground on a rock she can't get around or control. Ms Kelly delivers an astounding range of emotions, actions and reactions that give her character amazing depth, breathing life into a complex, very real person. There is one short scene near the end of the movie where she non-verbally displays a range of confused emotions that will literally empathically stun you. Terry O'Quinn does an admirable job as the slightly over bearing father pushing a daughter he loves deeply and Roy Dotrice carries his role as the tough love trainer who worries about his athletes beautifully.

Another aspect of this movie is the well illustrated grittiness of the skaters training. Seeing both the main characters hitting the ice hard, especially her, makes you question the sanity of all involved. One scene where they are learning a new move is a series of her slamming into the ice repeatedly only to hear the trainer yell ""Again"" until she simply can't get back up. In that same series he hits the ice a few times and gets cut by her skate blade. Intense.

This is also one of those scripts that is so sharply written you have to pay attention to what the characters are saying. A seeming offhand comment will change how you view someone or something. The personal growth and mutual respect that you watch grow between the characters  makes you forget you're watching a movie as you see the characters become real individuals as they drive to succeed.

I often judge a movie by its ending and how I feel after viewing it. In my mind, my highest praise is if I re-watch the ending. If you're like me, you'll watch the last fifteen minutes of this movie several times, just for the magnificence of it.",1518998400,5,2794,4.705521472392638
2466738,5,B000CNFC44,"I grew thru my teen years throughout the nineties and remember so many great movies from that time. Movies like the Kevin Costner Robin Hood, Forrest Gump, Titanic, and so on and so on. But those were the big box office hitters. My favorite movies that I still watch whenever I can are movies like The Cutting Edge. It reminds me of what happened in figure skating a few years after the movie came out and how different the world was. I was young, but I watched figure skating whenever I could. Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding, Kristi Yamaguchi, Oksiana Baiul, Scott Hamilton, Elvis Stoiko...I loved them all. And this movie brings those heartfelt memories back. Plus it is a great movie. ""Just remember who said it first."" And my favorite scene, ""Toepick!""",1518825600,,755,4.7272727272727275

2466741,5,B000CNFC44,"The intensity is amazing.  The acting is superb..The personalities shown by the actors of the 2 main characters is far above a 5 stars..

It's certainly that Hollywood doesn't have the intelligence anymore to make this kind of movies any longer.  They are too busy only promoting their ""corrupted lifestyle"" and been only with their 'tunnel-vision"" on making that appear normal.  What a shame....",1518134400,2,396,5.140625
2466742,5,B000CNFC44,"The Cutting Edge is one of the finest movies ever made.  That's probably too strong, too, but I love this movie!

This is just a really fun romcom.  It's perfect -- exactly what it should be.  D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly have great chemistry.  It not too campy, not too serious about itself. Beautiful people. Beautiful scenes.  Excellent HEA.

It's not Casablanca.  Just enjoy it for what it is.  I know I do!",1518134400,2,411,4.52054794520548

The acting is perfect the subtle communication between the actors  is somthing i see in only academy award movies.

2466752,4,B000CNFC44,"Figure skating is the only sport that I have ever enjoyed watching and this movie does a lot to show why it qualifies as a sport.

Behind the beauty and artistry of the skating are people who struggle to master their craft.  Pairs skating is the focus of this movie and we also get to see the technical and personal challenges that skating partners face.

The actors do a very credible job of presenting a realistic picture of what goes into a award winning performance that only lasts for several minutes but takes years to achieve.  It is well worth watching.",1492473600,2,561,4.524752475247524

2466758,4,B000CNFC44,"Loved the way this movie took the ethos of hockey and applied it to a personality clash on the ice.  The skating was also fun to watch, and Ms. Kelly is a stunning beauty.  The Olympic moves in the last scene didn't make much kinetic sense (unless Ms. Kelly can fly like Peter Pan), but that's a minor issue.

2466767,3,B000CNFC44,"The story is entertaining and at least semi-plausible, but don't think of this as a family movie just because of the PG rating.

2466768,4,B000CNFC44,"I have always loved this movie. Its a chick flick, but who cares? Its one of the most enjoyable and clean movies around. No violence, except what is normal for training on the ice, and no sexual perversion. The script uses growing sexual attraction between the two main characters to keep tension at the forefront of the movie, but you wouldn't have to shut it down if your 8 year old walked into the room. I was very happy to see this movie as an offering on Amazon Prime.

2466833,4,B000CNFC44,"This is what I would call a ""guilty pleasure"" romantic comedy. I really enjoyed it despite its having just about every romance cliche imaginable. The scenario is that the hero is a hockey player who gets busted up for playing hockey but he can still skate for figure skating. A young woman has lost yet another partner and needs a male partner. Money being no object to her wealthy father, they go after him. His biggest problem is going from the macho role of hockey god to the comparatively sissy role of male figure skater in pairs skating. Her major problem is that she needs to get a whole heck of a lot better than she is. Along the way the two begin falling in love. It is great fun and women especially will enjoy it as an evening's entertainment.",1461196800,,755,4.4

2467068,5,B000CNFC44,"As a child of the 90s I grew up watching this film every so often on those now ancient VHS.

I loved figure skating as a kid,  and this is one of the few movies that centers around that particular sport that doesnt get much coverage in the US.  The chemistry is palpable between the two leads, and the female character arc is done quite well. So, great chemistry, good character arc, believable coaching from the Russian, er, Swede. ;) Yes, the dialogue is somewhat abrasive at times, you could say unnecessarily so, but I guess that was the director's way of conveying the high pressure of the competition. It's got just the right balance of humor (love the part where Doug ""comes out"" to his hockey family about his conversion to figure skating...:D )

This is classic 90s in plot and editing. I'll always come back to watch as the years pass. Very satisfying ending.",1458604800,20,869,4.551282051282051

2467071,3,B000CNFC44,"90's nostalgia aside, the strength of this movie is not the skating as it's pretty apparent that the stars were extensively doubled.  Additionally, the competition sequences are not particularly realistic as anyone who has watched the Olympics will realize (they never compete with the lights off and never use spotlights on the skaters).  That being said, this simple story is carried by the two leads.  Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney have very good chemistry and play the ""Taming of the Shrew"" dynamic pretty convincingly.  The rest of the supporting cast is relatively inconsequential, but the cameos by several real life skating stars is a nice touch.  Despite the small but dedicated cult following of this movie, it is a shame that it didn't prove to be a better vehicle for either of the leads.  Moira Kelly in particular deserved much better than the smattering of roles that came in the following years.  Thankfully, both resisted any temptation to appear in any of the abysmal sequels to this film.  If you're in the mood for a 90's throwback rom/com, ""The Cutting Edge"" is a guilty pleasure that anyone from that era will remember fondly.  If you've never seen it, forgive the lack of skating authenticity and enjoy these two actors.",1458345600,11,1242,4.904306220095694

2467119,4,B000CNFC44,"My review of this film is probably positively impacted by seeing the sequel (Part 2) first.  This is a far superior movie to the sequel, although the stories are basically the same.  The original film does a better job of developing the dynamics and conflicts between the principle characters.  Also, the story line is just a little bit closer to reality, in terms of the man's ability to adapt to the figure skating world.  I enjoyed the story, and I enjoyed the interactions between all of the characters.  The small subplot regarding the father-daughter relationship was also affecting.  This isn't a great film, but it's a good watch, particularly on a date night.",1458172800,,668,4.867256637168142

Yet, this is probably one of the best films I have ever seen to this day that both men and women can actually enjoy together.  It's strange because the budget for this film is nothing special at all.  Yet, everything is done to perfection.  The director truly out done their self on this one.  Moira Kelly is the lead but they managed to blend it so well with DB Sweeny.  Rian Johnson and his ongoing Star Wars disaster should take a few notes on this along with JJ Abrams.  More specifically how both lead actors shared the spotlight so well their roles together was the foundation of the entire movie.  It's a shame we don't have movies like this anymore in this day and age.",1522800000,,738,4.343065693430657

8099613,5,B000CNFC44,"The Cutting Edge is a combination of a romantic comedy sports film. The plot is about a very rich, spoiled figure skater Kate Mosley,played by Moira Kelly,who is paired with a has-been ice hockey player,Doug Dorsey,played by D. B. Sweeney for Olympic figure skating. They face off against a Soviet pair in the climax of the film, which is set at the site of the 16th Winter Olympic Games, in Albertville, France.

Kate Mosley is a world-class figure skater training for the 1988 Winter Olympics. She has genuine talent, but years of being spoiled by her wealthy father have made her all but impossible to work with. Doug Dorsey is an exceptional hockey player with drive, skill, and a full complement of arrogance. His team is also in the Olympics. Doug suffers an eye injury during that game which damages his peripheral vision, and he is forced to retire from the sport.

In the lead-up to the next Winter Olympics four years later, Kate has driven out all potential skating partners with her attitude and perfectionism; her coach, Anton Pamchenko, needs to find another replacement. He proceeds to track down Doug, who by now is back home in Minnesota, working in a steel mill and playing in a semi- professional hockey league on the side. Desperate for another chance at Olympic glory, Doug agrees to work as Kate's partner, even though he has a macho contempt for figure skating. However, Kate's snooty, prima donna behavior gets on his nerves immediately. The first few practices between them do not go well. In time, though, their relationship grows warmer, and they learn to work together and become a pair to be reckoned with both on and off the ice. They advance all the way to the finals in Albertville and look to be one of the top pairs competing for the gold. Everything is going well until they realize that they have fallen in love with each other. Doug and Kate are forced to reconcile these new feelings with their mutual desire to win at all costs.

Although a lot of the thematic formulas were applied in this film from other movies like sports underdog,unlikely romance from two people from different backgrounds,the United States-Soviet Union rivalry and many more,Cutting Edge works as it was entertaining from beginning to end. Credit that to the brilliant screenplay from Tony Gilroy. Despite of applying many clichs that have been used in many romantic comedies,the story was presented in a way that the viewer will find it both original,refreshing and surprisingly addictive. Added to that,there great chemistry between Kelly and Sweeney that the viewer will definitely be engaged in their characters. Aside from that,their performance made it heartwarming due to their honest portrayal. Both made the film engaging and surprisingly addictive. And of course,the one could never forget the 90's soundtrack in the movie led by Joe Cocker's Feel Like Forever. Overall,I consider this one of the best romantic comedy/sports movie ever released.",1522627200,,2967,4.96579476861167
