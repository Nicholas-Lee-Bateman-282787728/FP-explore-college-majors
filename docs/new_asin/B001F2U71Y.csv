3561791,4,B001F2U71Y,"I liked this dvd set and i think that all the case closed sets are worth the money. Conan and all the charaters are really good and each case is usually a tough one to solve. I also like to look at the dvd set in the original japanese- even if i see the english version first- the japanese version- is better becuase you see the relaitonships are a LOT closer than in our English language- for instance in the japanese versions you see that conan and richard have a good relationship-  conan calls richard ""uncle"" and it is a term of respect---- little points like this really enhance my enjoyment of the show",1299369600,5,609,4.342105263157895
3561792,4,B001F2U71Y,"Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the Case Closed series!  Right along the same lines, and you finally get to meet K.I.D. the phantom thief!  Harley Hartwell finally puts two and two together and helps Jimmy start to put his own clues together.",1285372800,,255,4.644444444444445
3561793,5,B001F2U71Y,"I adore this show!!! I have ever since it was aired on Adult Swim back in the early 2000's. This season has episodes not seen in the United States, which was a joy to watch! If you love Case Closed, then you should definatly buy these dvds. The box style of the Viridian Collection fits well within a dvd rack or case.

3561794,5,B001F2U71Y,"With each season, the Case Closed anime just keeps getting better and better.  I love this show and cannot wait to watch more seasons of Case Closed in the future.  The criminals get smarter and more cunning with each case and that is just the sheer brilliance of the show that keeps me entertained time and again.  I cannot wait to get to the fourth and fifth seasons.  They will truly be grand.",1246233600,,396,4.383561643835616
3561795,5,B001F2U71Y,"Case Closed is one the most well rounded, engaging and throughly enjoyable anime series out there.  It is a joy to watch and i always love how things are explained and how Jimmy (Conan) catches the bad guy (girl).  Of course with the help of dim-witted Detective Richard Moore who spends as much time drinking and chasing after his favorite pop idol.  But somehow they make it work and of course there's the whole Rachel and Jimmy thing.  She hasn't figured out that Conan is really Jimmy Kudo in a pint sized body.  It makes for a hilarity that is rarely matched by others out there.  If you are looking for an anime series that you can get into and get your money's worth.  Well Case Closed is it believe me, you'll be hooked after one or two episodes.",1236297600,,754,4.381294964028777

3561798,5,B001F2U71Y,"I am a great fan of Case Closed.  I bought the Season 3 set assuming the episodes were new.  I did not check the episode titles. Unfortunately, I had already seen all the Season 3 episodes in previous Funimation DVDs (in the two series Case Four and Case Five which I thought were season 4 and 5).  The episodes in Season 3 are 53 through 79.  You can see the titles in the Wikipedia entry ""List of Case Closed episodes.""  This is a good product, but you might want to check if you have not already seen these episodes.",1227657600,2,519,4.202020202020202
3561799,5,B001F2U71Y,"case closed is an amazing anime which apeals to both kids and adults with its humor, acton, and of course, mystery. This season is a particularly strong including some of my favorite episodes. Overall its very fun to watch and despite the fact that the main, overarching plot is only adressed in a few episodes- the ones in between are far from filler- I recomend this season set very highly.",1225065600,3,392,4.614285714285714

3561822,5,B001F2U71Y,"The product is complete and is exactly like the prior versions, disregarding the case design. Very good series. Audible languages are English dub and Japanese. You can choose no subtitles or English subtitles. List of episodes inside leftmost case interior. Some discs have bonus content. Only complaint is the ugly green stripe on the outside, but for the price, and being virtually the same excluding that, it is worth the trade off.",1440028800,,435,5.055555555555555

3561827,5,B001F2U71Y,"Detective Conan (case closed) is easily my favorite show of all time. With over 23 seasons, 18 movies,  and 32 specials its not hard to understand why but sadly us Americans only got 5 seasons and 8 movies....The show gets beyond crazy in the later seasons and movies and unfortunately we will likely never get it here but that doesnt mean don't watch it, if you like mysteries and comedies this is the best you can hope for.",1421625600,,425,4.448717948717949

3561874,4,B001F2U71Y,"My biggest issue with the subbed version of this series by funimation is that the title song is a few seconds off from the original. It's fine in the dubbed version, which is really weird. Also I really hate the dub. It sounds phoned in with no real emotion to it. However, I really love this series. It's fun and engaging, and the story stays interesting.",1370908800,,356,4.409090909090909

3561878,5,B001F2U71Y,"This is a excellent anime series for those who like mystery and detective series.  With the main character (Conan) being an up and coming great detective, yet forced to live in a young boy's body after he was forced to take some terrible new and experimental pill, the series becomes quite intriguing as the boy must now gather the clues and solve the crime in different ways since no one would likely believe a little kid.  Each episode is just so fun to watch as Conan somehow manages to gather all the clues, solve the crime, and bring the criminals to justice using several different methods.  It is also aways fun to try and figure out who committed the crime before Conan does.  Season 3 is just as great as the previous seasons and even introduces new characters to the series.  It is not too violent, and it still has all of the wonderful pieces to a great mystery/detective series.",1363046400,,890,4.5375
