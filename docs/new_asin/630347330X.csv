7849222,4,630347330X,"I saw this movie years ago and I remember that I enjoyed it and felt intrigued by it but felt a bit disappointed by the ending. My question at that time was, why such an ending?

Having seen that this film was re-released on DVD, I bought it and watched with the desire to see what it was about this story that culminates to such an ending. This movie is basically about lost souls whom are all trying to fit into worlds that they don't inherently relate to and the consequences of trying to do so.

Thomas is a young moody and troubled boy who is a victim in his parents divorce and is trying to find his place in the situation. He lies, causes trouble, has no friends and brutally and honestly says what he thinks just to piss people off. One day he accidentally happens upon a young thief hiding out in a crypt in the local cemetery and this thief threatens to harm him if he doesn't bring him money. Being scared, Thomas takes some money to this man, but another thief is there and tries to kill Thomas. The first thief saves Thomas by killing the second thief, his partner in crime. Thomas tells his mother what happened, but she doesn't believe him as most don't, because he's a known liar.

Lili, Thomas' mother, is a woman who is in a legal fight to keep Thomas from the father, who wants to take him from her. She owns a club that the locals don't like and has a reputation as being a bit different. Her parents, especially her mother who is all about being proper, keep trying to get her back with her ex husband, a man whom she despises and who feels no problem about using her vulnerability in wanting to keep their son, to force himself on her.

Feeling lost and depressed, Lili constantly struggles between her desire to keep her son, which means she has to feign provincial normality, and wanting to be who she really is, someone who does not fit into that mold. When the thief shows up at her bar, she finds herself attracted to him in a way that she hasn't felt up until now because of her constant stifling of who she is. Both she and thief find something in each other that they both relate too and need, and come together. The consequence of this attraction though, is something that will change everyone's life forever.

This film was written and directed by Andre Techine, whom I've mentioned before is one of my favorite directors. He brings to this film his usual insight and ability to access and express the psychology and human nature of the characters, which is as profound as usual.

What I loved about this film, as I do many French films, is that the ending follows the theme of the story and is not fixed, nor does it try to pacify the audience with an unrealistic good feeling. The characters are all in a flux, all reacting to each other and events and making choices according to who they are and their unconscious psychological needs. For me, the second viewing of this film, many years later, gave me insight into why Lili does what she does in the end, and it makes sense to me even if it's unsettling.

I don't think this is one of the best films of Techine or Deneuve; however there was something about the quiet complexity of it that had a huge appeal to me and it's become one of my favorite films.",1201305600,9,3240,4.354304635761589
7849223,3,630347330X,"In comparison with his later but more mature films, Techine's ""Scene of the Crime"" is more like a practice piece in the mode of Claude Chabrol. Like ""Wild Reeds"", ""My Favorite Season"", and ""Strayed"", this thriller is set in rural France, the supposedly ideal landscape for impressionist paintings. However, underneath its idyllic and serene exterior lies genuinely shocking but not entirely suspenseful undercurrents intricately interweaving Lili ( played by Catherine Deneuve, the ever gorgeous and increasingly resourceful actress as she is aging ), Martin ( played by one of Techine's regulars in the 80s, the moody actor Wadeck Stanczak, whose portrayal of an escaped criminal is too predictably sentimental and unbelievably one-sided ), Alice ( played by Claire Nebout, whose feral facade and wild gesture is indelibly sensual but whose threesome relaionship with Martin and his accomplice, another escaped prisoner whom Martin accidentlly killed during their brawl over Thomas, is unconvincingly pathological ),  Thomas ( Lili's son, played marvelously by newcomer, Nicholas Giraudi),Lili's mother ( played by the legendary Danielle Darrieux, whose stunning ""Madame"" in Max Ophuls' "" Madame de...."" is one of the highlights in her long career) , Lili's ex-husband, Maurice ( his projecting of home movie on the wall or on Lili looks contrived ), and Lili's old dad ( Jean Bousquet).

The screenplay was written by Techine, along with another two important figures in French cinema after the New Wave, Pascal Bonitzer and Oliver Assayas. Under these cineastes' influence, the movie is replete with noir allusions ( Ms. Deneuve plays a bar owner, which is a strong echo of noir classic ""Mildred Pierce"") and a parady of or a play on noir conventions ( the mother-daughter rivalry is turned to son-father competition for mother's attention ). Martin, the initial threat to the stability of the family, is eventually the only one who can loosen the close bond between Lili and her son. Another potential savior, father Sorbier, turns out to be a barrier to better understanding of these people, in particular, Thomas and his friends and family.

The whole film captures some level of complexities in human psychology and absurdities in human condition, but overall, it is paled by psycho-thrillers of Chabrol at his best and Ozon's suspense-thriller gems steeped in wacky queerness, let alone Hitchcock's masterpieces, like "" Vertigo"", ""The Birds"",and "" The Rear Window"".  Judging from Techine's later films, his universe is revealed to be full of profound observations of human psyches, such as "" Alice and Martin"", as well as tinged with a ""juicy"", self-reflexive, reflective and most importantly, honest gaze at exoticism and racial fetishism, prominently in films like "" Changing Times"", and ""The Witnesses"". Watching this film made by Techine in 1986, I gladly find that he is maturing wisely and sincerely as he is advancing in years!",1200614400,5,2942,5.293361884368308
7849224,4,630347330X,"The title is a bit misleading since Le lieu du crime is not a noir thriller or a mystery. It is a relationships movie with psychological undertones. Director Andre Techine is especially drawn to the exploration of family affairs featuring naturalistic depictions of human sexuality. For example see My Favorite Season (1993), also starring Catherine Deneuve, in which the central tension, maintained for decades, is that of a brother's unrequited desire for his older sister. Techine is very good at exploring taboo situations without leaving us with a sense of the perverse, and he is able to hint at a deeper, non-expressed sexuality behind ordinary life.
Here Catherine Deneuve stars as Lili Ravenel, who has a 13-year-old son, Thomas (Nicolas Giraudi), who is not doing well at school, a father who no longer cares about people at all, including members of his own family, and a mother who is emotionally close and distant by turns. Lili is estranged from her husband, a man she no longer loves, if ever she did. She is a woman of a certain age who finds diversion in managing a night club. Thus we have the familiar psychology of the bored middle class woman who, we know, will be drawn irresistibly to the excitement of an outsider. Directors who find themselves in the enviable position of directing the beautiful, cool and stately Deneuve seem themselves irresistibly drawn to showing her in compromised situations. I'm thinking of Belle de Jour (1967) and Mississippi Mermaid (1969), directed respectively by Luis Bunuel and Francois Truffaut. In the former Deneuve is a day-tripping prostitute and in the latter she is a criminal on the run. For some odd reason there is something deeply moving about seeing Deneuve give into her baser nature. (I think.)
Anyway, here she does indeed give herself to the rough young man who has killed his companion, and she does so without a hint of regret or lingering doubt. Incidentally in Techine's My Favorite Season, mentioned above, there is a scene in which a young intern has his way with Deneuve using much the same approach that Wadeck Stanczack, who plays Martin, an escaped con, employs here. That Lili's sexuality is aroused by his crude demand is the psychology that Techine wants to concentrate on; but because one of the weaknesses of his movie is a lack of focus, the impact of her desire is not as strongly felt as it might be. For a most striking and stunning exploration of this theme see Vittoria De Sica's unforgettable The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971).
Another weakness of this movie is some unconvincing action and dialogue in places. The opening scene in which Thomas is threatened by Martin who demands money to help him escape is a case in point. Martin's threats seem mild and ineffective. One wonders why Thomas is compelled to return. I also wonder about the boy's response to seeing his mother in bed with Martin. His first reaction is to say, ""He will kill you!"" and then later he asks his father, ""Is that love?"", which doesn't seem like something a 13-year-old would say. A six-year-old, maybe. Also a puzzle is why Claire Nebout, who is interesting as Alice, the girl involved with the two escapees, stops her car in the rain to pick up Thomas only to throw him out a few minutes later. Why did she stop at all? As the scene was shot he seemed to be in the middle of the road, so she couldn't avoid him, but considering that it was dark and it was raining, I don't think that would happen. At any rate, the purpose of the scene is to show that Thomas, like his mother, is starved for excitement, begging Alice to take him with her.
My favorite Techine movie is Rendez-Vous (1985) starring a very young and vital Juilette Binoche, who is clearly adored by the director. It is, like this movie, uneven in places, but Binoche is incredibly sexy and captivating. If you are a Binoche fan, see it. You will experience a side of her not shown in her American movies.
By the way, when this was filmed Deneuve was about 43-years-old and had already appeared in at least 67 films. She is the kind of woman who grows more beautiful as she grows older. I found her much more attractive here than when I first saw her in the celebrated The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), released when she was 21.",1021334400,4,4271,4.696
7849225,4,630347330X,"Catherine Deneuve is never more animated then she is when she is directed by Techine. The icon drops and you get a believable human being. In this case a good intentioned, independent, stubborn, highly flawed human being who falls in love with a young man in trouble and has responsibilities that she both wants and on occasions avoids.
The story involves a single mother who falls for an escaped convict who murdered his accomplice in order to save the woman's son. Add to this her husband, who uses their custody issue to get what he wants from her and the very intense girlfriend of the two escaped men and you have an excellent mix of characters.
The movie is not perfect, but it did hold my attention. The ending was not what I expected,",1001289600,2,742,4.544776119402985
