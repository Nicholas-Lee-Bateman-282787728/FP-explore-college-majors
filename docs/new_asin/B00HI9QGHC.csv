6166606,2,B00HI9QGHC,I thought there would be more of a plot and suspense. You could easily predict what was coming next. Average movie,1396828800,,114,4.476190476190476
6166607,4,B00HI9QGHC,"I am a huge David Lyons fan which is why I decided to rent this.  The premise is nothing new & was a bit predictable but Lyons & Clarke turn in wonderful performances.  The twist at the end was unexpected and I enjoyed it.  Overall, it's a good movie but you can also find better.",1395705600,,280,4.054545454545455
8632998,4,B00HI9QGHC,"Swerve is a low budget simple film, but that actually works in it's favour.  Basically a man on the way to a job interview is having car trouble in the middle of the Australian desert. He's got an interview in Broken Hill in the days ahead and is trying to make it there. Dangerously overtaking him on a blind turn is car, we the viewer know is being driven by a drug dealer who blew up the guy who gave him the cash with one of those Hollywood bombs with a big digital countdown display on it hidden amongst the white powder bags.  Unfortunately for the dealer, he almost has a head on collision with a beautiful blonde woman who also is speeding fastly away from something.  We the viewer don't know what, but we know she took a small backpack full of $50 dollar notes with her.  Both cars spin out of control avoiding each other, the woman's seems undamaged to my eyes, but apparently can't be driven. The dealer's flipped over repeatedly crushing the roof and basically becoming a wreck.  The job interview driver checks on both drivers, the dealer is dead, but a suitcase full of aliens ($100 notes) catches his eye, and he doesn't want to leave it at the scene.  He takes the woman back towards the town she had come from, she asks to be dropped off at a long dirt driveway out of town, ignores his request for her name.  He drives into the town where he finds the police station locked, so heads to the pub to ask about the location of the constable to report what happened.  He also needs a mechanic.

Swerve is a nice little thriller.  Sure it's a bit predictable, but this sort of film often is.  It's a fun journey there though.",1512432000,,1639,4.340983606557377
8632999,4,B00HI9QGHC,"I do love myself a twisty Aussie thriller!  Nothing compares to Australian film noir.  This movie had quite a cast of characters and was unpredictable. We thought we knew where it was going but, WRONG ANSWER!  In the spirit of The Square you will find your self talking to the characters and saying ""don't do it! ""  Hold your breath and hit play.",1483056000,,346,4.444444444444445
8633000,5,B00HI9QGHC,"Just my style-- an action-drama & romance ""take the money & run"" plot.
.
But some in this accidental [it's quite an accident]  3-threesome of  two strong-willed ex-military men  and a seductive young wife are  running from other things in the Oz desert.
.
And  some  are just good  moral citizens.
.
But a found suitcase full of new $100s can cause a sudden change of direction...and affection.
.
This  is a very clever heady brew of twist after  credible  twist -- maybe they call em Swerves in Oz;
.
you try to be ready for em, but you cant be -- these ppl are driven you might say -- sex & big  cash money can do that -- even  to those moral types.

Thats the charm of this writing, directing & acting --
.
Well done!

8633001,3,B00HI9QGHC,I bought it for Jason Clarke but the story wasn't too bad. Very choppy with some bad acting on the female part. But the 2 male leads carry the movie. Seemed like they really didn't know where they were going with the story and wrote it as they went along. But still a good way to spend an hour and a half. I love me some Jason Clarke so it was worth the price.,1437523200,,360,3.8783783783783785
8633002,4,B00HI9QGHC,"This was a very good and entertaining film from start to finish. Even though
it had no big-name actors, the acting was very good. It keeps you interested
throughout. A good storyline.  I would recommend this film highly.",1418774400,2,220,4.7894736842105265
8633003,5,B00HI9QGHC,Good Movie,1417478400,,10,4.5
8633004,5,B00HI9QGHC,great thanks,1406764800,,12,5.5
8633005,3,B00HI9QGHC,"Great premise and I had high hopes for this but it was disappointing.  Visually it was very stunning but the characters were vague and I'm just not sure what happened.  Was Jina trying to get rid of Colin?  Who was the money for? Who was the guy looking for the money? What did the line from the bartender at the end mean?  There was a moment when they got to the well and I thought, here's where it picks up - but it never did.  Frank seemed more interested in just beating up anyone who looked at his wife. Colin should've hightailed it out of there at the first chance.  He didn't seem interested in Jina despite her attempts so why was he hanging around?  3 stars for cinematography, 2 stars for actual plot.",1400889600,,712,4.268656716417911
8633006,4,B00HI9QGHC,Doesnt have that wow factor to it. But it is not a bad movie. The ending will blow your mind! lol. It was pretty exciting kept my attention and hey not so bad.,1400198400,,159,3.8484848484848486
8633007,3,B00HI9QGHC,"While not a great film it remains an enjoyable viewing experience. I enjoy the actors in this film, especially David Lyons, who has become one of my favorite actors the last couple of years -- one of those actors who never disappoints. Interesting characters coupled with the kind of story line you expect in these kind of films. The scenery serves as a character in this film, catching your attention and encouraging your eye to roam about the screen. Ultimately, my husband and I enjoyed the reminder that no good deed goes unpunished. A cool ironic ending that made me chuckle. A fun film to watch with friends.",1400198400,2,614,4.694444444444445
