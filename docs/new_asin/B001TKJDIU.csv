3791890,5,B001TKJDIU,"Army Wives is one of the best series on TV today. I was so pleased to get the second series on DVD. The first season built the characters and history which really launched the second season into a whole new level. The 2nd season is filled with drama, laughter, and tears. We are brought into the women's lives in a deeper manner and can relate so much more. Since I didn't have cable to watch it on TV, I couldn't get enough watching it on the DVD's - played one episode right after another. Bonus with the second season - the packaging for the 5 discs is the best I've seen for a TV series. Wish all DVD's came like this.",1246838400,3,622,4.148760330578512
3791891,5,B001TKJDIU,"Army Wives is MUST see T.V. one of the best shows curretly airing, couldn't wait to add to my collection.",1246492800,,105,4.3
3791892,5,B001TKJDIU,This is the best season yet!! I would recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in this show!,1246320000,,108,4.45
3791893,3,B001TKJDIU,"The strength of this series has been its sometimes authentic portrayal of the facts of military family life and the balance created by some characters' questioning of the whole system. Without this reflection by some characters, it would have disintegrated into an unacceptably simplified ""patriotism"", perhaps even incendiary. After watching the second season episodes back-to-back, reunited with ""the gang"", coming to terms with Amanda's death, I began to feel slightly irritated by what struck me as unnatural dialogue and lack of convincing variety of emotional expression in some characters. Not to mention almost perfect hair etc. on victims of a bomb explosion. Claudia Joy was exceptionally believable, but Denise was just too smooth, too perfect. Evelyn showed more depth and authenticity than Denise, as did Trevor and Col. Holden. Joan and Roland finally stopped talking to each other like stiff dolls with Ph. D.s and became more natural and believable. Roxy's expressed anger at the Army for not knowing where Trevor was, was quite refreshing, yet always stopped short of really losing it. The seeds planted for future episodes are promising. When will the third season be available? As an Air Force brat, I am strangely attracted to this series although I am not at all convinced of the need for  the U.S. to be in Iraq. (or Afghanistan.) What I miss is Amanda's courage in questioning the military. Every brat knows how dangerous that can be. And what brat couldn't  totally relate to Evelyn's running away with her boyfriend, to avoid a painful separation, even if we all know it won't work out...
Keep it real, please, by unflinchingly showing the unnatural tensions in military life. Don't water it down!",1246233600,,1722,5.124555160142349
3791894,4,B001TKJDIU,I loved this show.  I couldn't wait for it to arrive after watching the first season - the second season was even more enjoyable.  The cast are amazing actors and the writers and producers just brilliant.  The way all the characters are developed through this season is beautiful to watch - I can't wait for the next season.,1244592000,,324,4.551724137931035
3791895,5,B001TKJDIU,"What a GREAT cast!  Each character is played and  developed so well that by the end of the show, now I can hardly wait for the Second Season to arrive in the mail. EACH actor as well as the programs creators must be applauded for their outstanding, deeply moving, uniquely individual personae  that are portrayed. I was not even aware of the existence of the show until I found out that Catharine Bell had continued her career after the incredible job she did during all of the JAG years.  That's the reason I purchased the series--I gambled on Catharine.  And then to find the entire group so talented and convincing, was a real treat.  For those who love JAG, NCIS, The Unit, or any other military-focused series, this is a very welcome addition.  Extremely enjoyable is the ""partial cast group question-answer session with the produces, or creators of the show.""  The actors show their true selves during this session, and seem to have developed a family- comeraderie, which I found very refreshing. I think the productions values are even higher because of it.  I loved getting to see them as people.  Bravo for this series--I hope it continues for many years.",1243814400,9,1164,4.746268656716418

3791982,5,B001TKJDIU,"This series is so great--it is that rare series where perfect casting meets interesting script. There is just enough drama to make it interesting and keep it moving along, and is intelligently done, I think.  I have never been an army wife, but this appears so real to me from those who are have related back to me--and like real life it has a good balance of fun and good times mixed with tense and bad moments too.  But just like in real life, these characters reveal strength to overcome their mistakes or ""rough patches"" and go on in life.  Incidently, they have great clothes and the male characters are handsome too.  Just sayin--because those elements help make this very watchable too.  I don't usually watch too much TV anymore, so much of it is trash or worse, recycled trash, but I one day stumbled on this show and was hooked by it.  I am pleased they used real Army so much throughout, to celebrate the everyday heroes and what it is like for them to deploy and come back from war.  Very intelligently done, so worth watching.",1416096000,,1039,4.49468085106383

3791998,2,B001TKJDIU,"The whole season includes multiple emotionally taxing events, I cried through nearly every episode and it drained my energy, which is not something I appreciate when it comes to entertainment. The end was an absolute disappointment and unrealistic that everything can go so wrong in everyone's lives. Due to the end which clearly shows that all the authors had in mind is to get you to buy the next series and make money and is far from being realistic, I will not watch anymore of this.",1402617600,,487,4.674418604651163

It gave me an incite of appreciation of the turmoils that can complicate the lives of these families.  The long soldier deployments and the wives left to raise the children while the soldier is gone.  The emotional aspects of fear of death while the soldier is on assignment in a war zone ( both wives, husbands and the children) make for a very true hearted show.

3792112,5,B001TKJDIU,"This second series, like the first, excels in meaningful everyday life stories. I enjoy to see how the wifes are able to resolve difficulties in their relationship with the members of the community. A lot of wisdom transpires, and the writers of the stories show some deep understanting of the human psyche. A lot of fun, good humor, meaningful conversations.

I wanted to see how the whole story started so ordered the 1st season and have been pleased to see how it all began.  The show is one that the whole family watch and is very meaningful and shows what ""Army Wives"" go thru when their partners are deployed.  Wish more shows would show the compassion that this one does",1366156800,,487,4.329670329670329

3792164,2,B001TKJDIU,The show has good intentions but essentially it boils down to any other drama that just happens to take place on an army base. You only know its an army base because of the few strategically placed humvees - something that you would never see on a real army base. The dialogue is OK  and the cinematography is pretty good so that earns it 2 stars.  Save yourself the time and watch something else.,1365811200,,397,4.351351351351352

3792202,5,B001TKJDIU,"After 911 happened, I remember exactly what I did that day and I knew that no one's life would ever truly be the same. I went in for a job interview and I got it but I was also just starting my 5th month of pregnancy and I felt like I was the worst mom to be in the world.  But my whole family made it through! I was forced  to stop watching the new cuz this world doesn't need this nor do we. I just happened to see this on Netflix and within a few weeks I was hooked and couldn't watch fast enough!  Know just those few weeks later I am so angry for watching  them all to fast : When they killed off Amanda's character it hit closer to home than I would have liked it to. I had one older sibling,  a sister who I. Loved and respected very much. She wasn't 18 but 29 and 14 days old.  In fact her husband joined the army and left for boot training after only one week of marriage allow they did already have two beautiful, Children before he left. I wish that my sister could have lived on post cuz she felt so alone much of the time! My sister loved watching army wives and it gave her much comfort knowing that she was never truly alone!
I just would like to say thanks to all the cast and crew and writer's, directors, kraft and to all the rest. Watching this awesome show has brought up things from my past. No parent should ever have to  bury there child and it's made me think how often do people die here waiting for there husbands to come home cuz they were excepted to do everything even though there health sucked. Because my nieces dad was in Korean, she watched her mother die and she wasn't even four yet so she couldn't do a thing about it until my baby brother found her like that after 1:30am the following morning. So I. Love your show but why doesn't everyone get the same experience?  Em",1355270400,,1807,4.070422535211268
