8192771,5,B000PMLDRW,Enjoyed the movie.  Always interesting to see a different version of Tarzan.  I wish the movie had been dubbed in English,1406419200,,121,4.714285714285714
8192772,5,B000PMLDRW,I only purchased it because of Kimi Katkar whom I think was beautiful. But I actually found the movie really enjoyable. Its a nice story.,1308873600,,137,4.52
8192773,3,B000PMLDRW,"Well, I was entertained for over 2 hours by this amazing amount of nonsense. Probably set in northern India (there are lions as well as tigers, Indian elephants, and large rubber crocodiles and anaconda-like snakes). Tarzan looks the part but Jane, I mean Ruby, wanders through the jungle in high-heeled boots and flimsy, often soaked transparent dresses... not that there's anything wrong with that. The typical Bollywood song and dance routines break out right on schedule and the budget makes a Troma film look high-class. I wish Tarzan had been a bit more macho, but overall this was a pleasantly jaw-dropping way to spend a rainy afternoon.",1303430400,,645,5.037383177570093
8192774,5,B000PMLDRW,"I bought this movie a few days ago after my friend suggested that I should do more to learn about other cultures. I don't watch bootlegged movies, but I didn't mind this one because it was surprisingly good.  'Tarzan' has a compelling and powerful storyline, with rich, well-developed characters.  The actors were brilliant, and I found myself in tears at many points through the movie.  It is a very good, well-made movie, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys foreign films or wants to learn more about other cultures.  I personally feel like I learned a lot about other people and places from it.  5 stars from me.",1301184000,,619,4.6422018348623855
8192775,4,B000PMLDRW,"Not as good as Disco Dancer, it feels a little longer but still really funny, intentionally and unintentionally.",1187740800,,112,5.277777777777778
