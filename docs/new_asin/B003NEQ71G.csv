4157270,4,B003NEQ71G,"Although director Dario Argento is synonymous with the giallo - that uniquely Italian category of sexually violent thriller - there's still an ongoing debate as to which particular film is his best.  And most opinions seem to revolve around which Argento one ran across first.  Was it the methodical, controlled artist behind The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red?  Or the anything-goes, heavy-metal madman responsible for Creepers and Trauma?  1982's Tenebrae actually combines both hemispheres of the director's twisted mind to create a giallo that happily veers off the rails from time to time, yet remains relatively logical throughout.

American crime novelist Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) is on a publicity tour of Italy when he's questioned by police about the vicious murder of a female shoplifter whose mouth is stuffed with pages from Neal's latest book, Tenebrae.  Although he's not yet a suspect, the writer takes it upon himself to investigate with the help of his personal assistant (Daria Ncolodi) and self-absorbed agent (John Saxon).  Soon the bodies begin to pile up, all victims of a killer who seems to be targeting ""deviant behavior.""  And the closer Neal gets, the more dangerous it becomes for those around him.

Dipping back into the genre after the financial failure of his overtly supernatural thriller, Inferno, Argento takes a uniquely self-reflexive approach to the material, pointing the blame for much of the onscreen carnage at the very author of the work itself.  Tenebrae is full of naked women killed in exceedingly brutal fashion, but the film curiously attempts to fight back against the giallo's label as a misogynistic playground for perverts.  The argument isn't very well presented, but - as pointed out in the Blu-ray extras - it's a turning point in Argento's career, pushing him towards female protagonists and a different take on the genre.

These moments aside, most of Tenebrae focuses on what the director does best:  operatic murder sequences, multiple red herrings and a music score that drills its way into your brain.  There's a certain recycling of ideas here from both Argento's previous films and the lesser-known work of others (point in fact, the final twist is lifted almost straight from 1971's The Bloodstained Butterfly).  And one can see that the director's attention drifts from time to time, resulting in brilliantly off-the-wall non-sequiturs like the dog attack sequence or the showy over-the-roof shot that seems to exist just to keep him interested.

Yet, that's exactly why fans of Argento stand by him through his successes and failures; there are always one or two moments worth the price of admission.  And Synapse Film's latest Blu-ray of Tenebrae presents the film in its best possible light, working from a color corrected restoration in 1080p from the original camera negative.  There's still a bit of '80s grain inherent in the source (as there should be) but the nighttime scenes in particular look astonishingly good.

Extras include dual English and Italian language options, an audio commentary from Argento scholar Maitland McDonagh, a hi-def version of the English version of the film using seamless branching, alternate opening credit sequence, trailers and the 90-minute documentary Yellow Fever:  The Rise and Fall of the Giallo, featuring interviews with over a dozen prominent critics and filmmakers who use Argento's work as a through-line to discuss the genre as a whole.",1473120000,3,3472,5.221621621621622
4157271,4,B003NEQ71G,"This 2015 blu-ray of Tenebrae by U.K. Arrow films is a reissue of the 2013 blu-ray version that's all
being a new reissue there are no new extras at all
both blu-ray versions have the exact same special features & exact same HD transfer
the only Difference is the cover art actually and the region code
for some reason Arrow films felt they needed to re-release the film on blu-ray again, who knows why

the 2013 blu-ray version which is the version i have is ABC coded
this new 2015 reissue is only region B coded,
very stupid decision to have this new one region B locked instead of ABC coded, it makes no sense actually
as i said before the extras on this new reissue is the same as the 2013 blu-ray
SCREAMING QUEEN-interview with Daria Nicolodi who plays one of the Actresses in the film
she talks about the film in Italian so there's English subtitles of course
THE UNSANE WORLD OF TENEBRAE- new interview with Dario argento
same thing the interview is in Italian with English subtitles
i have heard Dario speak English but i guess he's more comfortable talking about the film in Italian
COMPOSITION FOR CARNAGE- interview with Music composer Claudio Simonetti who did the music score for the film
AUDIO COMMENTARIES- there's 2 commentary tracks
1st is Argento expert Thomas rostock who talks about Tenebrae, i found him boring and not really informative
2nd is with Kim newman & Alan jones which is bit more informative commentary some of it is worth listening to
there's also footage of GOBLIN LIVE IN GLASGOW performing themes for Tenebrae & Phenomena
plus original trailer & booklet about the film and this blu-ray edition
the HD transfer is the same treatment for both blu-ray versions which is taken from the old Anchor bay DVD release
but given a HD transfer ofcourse
which is an excellent transfer, very nice sharp & clear picture quality, very nice colour restoration aswell
much better than the old Anchor bay release
the 1.0 Audio mix which is also taken from old Anchor bay release is in both English language & Italian, so take your pick
Italian option will have English subtitles at the bottom of the screen, which i find annoying
and the English version is ofcourse Dubbed with American actors/actresses
i prefer the Dubbed version , but each to their won meaning personal preference
not a bad effort from Arrow films pretty Good
4 stars for both 2015 & 2013 versions",1444521600,,2387,4.6968973747016705
4157272,5,B003NEQ71G,"I bought this because Arrow's release of Phenemona is amazing, but this appears very grainy and the colors are very faded; it certainly doesn't have the vibrance that Phenomena has.  Another reviewer wrote that this may be a copy from a VHS and that could very well be.  Hopefully, Synapse or Blue Underground will release a proper Blu ray version soon!  Still, five stars for the movie of course.",1420243200,,397,4.72463768115942
4157273,5,B003NEQ71G,"Dario Argento's 1982 giallo ""Tenebrae"" is what I feel to be the legendary Italian filmmaker's best film. It features a great cast, an unsually strong plot/script for an Argento film, breathtakingly violent murders and some of the most unique & virtuoso camera work either before or since.  If you haven't seen any of Argento's classic output, ""Tenebrae"" is a great one to start with!

As for Arrow Video's blu ray release of the film, if you scour the internet you'll see a lot of grumbling & controversy about a supposedly inferior hi-def transfer. This couldn't be further from the truth! I own both the anamorphic Anchor Bay DVD and this blu-ray and have done a direct comparison and I can safely say that the blu-ray blows the DVD out of the water and is truly like seeing the film again for the first time. Where there is possibly a slight problem with the film is that throughout the movie, there is a slight layer of video noise that isn't film grain that is somewhat noticeable but not intrusive at all in my opinion. It does resemble digital noise at times. A lot of recent blu-rays of Italian films have had the same slight visual peculiarity so maybe it's just how the negatives/film stock  were back then or the production house used to author the hi-def transfers themselves are utilizing a particular kind of high def restoration process. Colors though are very strong and the detail is truly astounding compared to past DVD releases. The bit-rate is also very high too.

There was also a slight issue with the old Anchor Bay DVD in which it was missing approximately 30 seconds due to print damage with the only print they had access to at the time. The Arrow Video blu ray is the full 1 hour 40 minute 54 second uncut version. Extras involve some interviews with Dario Argento, actress (and Dario's former wife) Daria Nicolodi and composer Claudio Simonetti. You also get two commentary tracks and a live performance by Claudio's former band Goblin too. The audio includes both the Italian & English tracks.

So, if you've been on the fence about picking up this particular blu ray, don't be and pick it up immediately. The film looks truly stunning and the nice array of extras compliment this classic giallo very nicely. Highly recommended!",1351123200,12,2258,4.720812182741117
4157274,4,B003NEQ71G,"To be honest, the only reason I purchased this is because NF does not offer the blu-ray.  I had seen it a few years ago, long enough to forget who did it, and weighed my options.  For me, the overall stylishness is what made it worth owning on blu-ray as opposed to renting again on DVD.  Beautiful poured concrete architecture, '80s women with powdered faces and red lips, old synthesizers, etc.  The arterial sprays and other death scenes are impressive and make me queasy to think about.  But it's the modern art deco which makes this sort of a 1930s murder mystery, but with more murder and lots of bright red blood.

4 stars because the story, although good, isn't any better than an episode of ""Murder She Wrote"".  Also, there are only two options for audio: all Italian or all English.  This means English lines are dubbed over in the Italian version and most lines are inauthentic in the English version.  The DVD I remember was mostly subtitled with any English dialogue coming through in English (the main character is an American and his English lines match his lips).  I wish there was this third audio option, but the ones presented here are good enough.  Two subtitle tracks are available, one which exactly follows the English audio and one which seems to be a closer translation of the the script.",1347667200,6,1313,4.640692640692641
4157275,5,B003NEQ71G,"Many people jump on this Blu-ray transfer and yes it may not be the best transfer but its all relative to the print negative. The DVD was rough around the edges too but I will tell you this Blu-ray is sooooooo much of an improvement from my Anchor Bay DVD. It actually looks quite nice at times, definitely worth the upgrade.",1347494400,3,325,4.344262295081967
4157276,5,B003NEQ71G,What is this the reviewer below me talking about?The blu ray transfer is amazing and a lot more sharper and better than any us version i have seen....Do Urself a favor and ignore the other review as of now and snatch this up before it goes out of print..comes with 4 reversable artwork and a booklet amzing blu-ray for collector's....,1339459200,4,334,4.583333333333333
4157277,1,B003NEQ71G,"Since this is one of my favorite Dario Argento films, I was really pleasantly excited to be able to get this great giallo on Blu-ray. However, upon watching this version, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Instead of seeing Blu-ray sharpness, the picture is grainy and mushy. Picture resolution is not nearly as good as on the older, standard DVD. It appears that transfer on this one was made straight from an old, VHS tape without any clean-up being attempted. It's really a shame, too, because this item comes with a really informative booklet describing the film, a film poster, and an appreciable number of disk extras. I have a substantial collection of Blu-rays and Tenebrae has absolutely the worst picture quality of the lot. Maybe someday, someone will issue an acceptable edition of this great thriller - but this one is better to pass!",1339027200,6,860,4.937931034482759

4157279,5,B003NEQ71G,"Up until recently, copies of Tenebrae had been pretty expensive to get ahold of, at least in North America, with copies of it often exceeding sixty dollars or more for the out of print Anchor Bay release. But finally, Synapse films saw fit to give this Argento classic the royal treatment it deserves. The film is often regarded as one of Dario Argento's best giallos, and it's reputation is well earned. The film is stylish, features fantastic cinematography, good looking locations, suitably graphic murder sequences that are filmed with his usual eye for beauty, and some solid nudity to back things up with.

But besides the movie, my favorite part of Synapse's Blu-ray release of the film is the inclusion of a 90 minute documentary titled ""Yellow Fever: The rise and fall of the Italian giallo.""",1480809600,7,801,4.889705882352941

4157281,5,B003NEQ71G,"This is an amazing movie. Anything Argento does makes me happy, but this movie has a certain feel to it. It's not supernatural like some of his other films and it really translates well to more audiences because of this.  John Saxon is also amazing to see!! The blu ray of this movie is just gorgeous. The colors pop and the audio is really on point. The dog chasing scene scared my dog so that can only be good!",1479340800,2,412,4.215189873417722

4157284,5,B003NEQ71G,"Over the past few months Ive come to appreciate the genre of horror films known as giallo more than I did in the past. While Id seen several of the movies long ago I never quite got what the whole interest in them was. I get it now. Its a style, the way a story is told, the images that combine with those to make a compelling movie. Ive discovered movies I missed and gone back to revisit some I saw long ago. TENEBRAE falls into that latter category.

Anthony Franciosa stars as Peter Neal, an author who specializes in horror filled tomes revolving around murder. In Italy to promote his latest book he suddenly finds himself in the midst of a real life serial killing situation. It seems that the killer must be a fan as hes murdering people similar to the styles used in Neals books and stuffing pages from his books in their mouths.

As the film moves forward more questions come to mind. Is the killer someone influenced by the work of Neal or is it actually Neal himself doing the killing? What tie with Neal does the killer have, a personal connection or just that of crazed fan? Who will the next victim of the killer be and do all the victims have something in common? All is revealed by the end with something most viewers won't see coming.

First off lets start with the acting. There isn't an actor in the bunch here who doesnt turn in a fine performance. Franciosa, a regular on numerous television series in the sixties and seventies, does a fantastic job as Neal, giving him that investigative edge when it comes to trying to solve the identity of the murderer while at the same time presenting himself as a likely suspect. A nice trick if you can pull it off and he does so quit well. John Saxon, a man who starred in what is considered the first giallo film, is on hand as well doing a great job as Neals agent. The other actors also turn in great performances though Im honestly not as familiar with their previous work, the only exception of which is Daria Nicolodi who has starred in several giallo works and was also the longtime companion of director Dario Argento.

Dario Argento. Among the directors most noted for creating and giving life to this genre, Argento is the one who made it more mainstream than ever and who led it from simple murder mysteries into the realm of horror with supernatural touches in several films. He takes the various elements of the genre, the black gloved hands, the violent deaths, the bright colors and camera angles and makes them his own. The blood spilled in Argentos films always flows bright red and bursts forth more so than earlier examples of the genre and yet in an artistic way that doesnt force you to turn your head. His style is truly recognizable and puts him among the greats of film history.

As I said, Ive watched films in this genre in the past and TENEBRAE is one of those films. I even recall having it in the video store I once owned, a new release that I was sure fans would embrace. But it never really quite caught on in my area and neither did the whole giallo genre. Even I wasn't quick to embrace it but at least I recognized it existed. In part that might have been because the quality of the movies at the time left much to be desired. It wasn't that they were terrible but still, the transfers were usually soft focused and dubbing was terrible. That all changed with DVD and more so now with blu-ray. When coupled with the treatment of this film by Synapse it gets even better.

Synapse has released a new version of the film on blu that is something to behold. The quality, the clarity, the crispness of the image is amazing. This new version features a supervised color correction and restoration of a 1080p scan from the original camera negative, presented in the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. What that means is the best quality picture to watch that has ever been offered.

In addition to that there are a number of other extras worth noting. There is a commentary track by film critic and Argento expert Maitland Mcdonagh. The blu-ray version includes a feature length documentary, YELLO FEVER: THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GIALLO by High Rise Productions discussing the rise in popularity of the genre from its early roots in crime fiction and on through its influence on slasher films into the world today. Also included are the original end credits sequence from the films U.S. version title UNSANE, alternate opening credits and an international trailer.

Synapse is doing a great job with the way they're handling releases like this and it makes fans and movie lovers grow anxious to see what they have next in store. Right now they're taking orders for another Argento film, PHEOMENA, and I for one cant wait to see what they do with it. If nothing else Im certain that well get the best looking version of the film, another among those I once saw in low quality VHS. With the care they're showing to the films of Argento it just makes you wish they could be responsible for handling all of his films.",1477008000,5,5002,4.489010989010989

8400952,4,B003NEQ71G,"Another entertaining giallo by the master himself. Decidedly less style-obsessed and visually inventive as some of his best work, but makes up for it with a suitably tangled murder mystery and some great kill sequences. The movie gets off to a somewhat clumsy start (and again there is that stilted acting and awkward dialogue that is almost part of the appeal of these movies once you're endeared to them), but steadily improves as it progresses. The climax really elevates the rest of the film and ends things on a high note. I also enjoyed the somewhat meta quality of the film, as it's about a giallo writer who provides some well-placed wink-and-a-nod dialogue that comments on the movie itself. Not a masterpiece, but a fun film with an unpredictable plot and a number of memorable sequences that make up for its shortcomings.

Starting with Deep Red (1975) , then Suspiria (1977), then Inferno (1980), and ending with Tenebrae (1982). A must see film if interested at all in giallos or Italian horror from the 80s.
