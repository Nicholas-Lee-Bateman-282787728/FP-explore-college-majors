7689117,2,B01CRIWR0S,"Strange film, unnecessary violence.",1476230400,,35,8.0
7689118,2,B01CRIWR0S,"This is three tales from Germany. The film has subtitles and the last two segments were mostly in English. The first film was extremely boring as we watch the boring life of a girl as she narrates about her three legged hamster Mucki as she calmly tortures and mutilates her bonded father in the other room. The second film concerns a magical amulet in the possession of a mute couple who are harassed by hooligans. The third episode and longest by far was about a photographer who meets a girl on line and joins a special sex club.

I found the entertainment value to be light even though the topics were unique in a general sense of the term. I never developed any connection with the people on the screen. Background character was not developed and acting could have been better. I am not entertained by a girl sitting on the bowl.

7689121,5,B01CRIWR0S,"It's very refreshing to see Jorg back behind the camera with the first installment on here called ""Final Girl"". He certainly hasn't lost his signature style after the long hiatus from film making. Long pans across a messy apartment, uncomfortable closeups and moody music set the tone for a dreary and strongly metaphorical tale about a girl and her pet guinea pig. Having met Jorg a few years ago and myself being a proud owner of a guinea pig I couldn't wait for this to come out and I was not disappointed. I wasn't familiar with the other directors (Kosakowski and Marschall) upon purchase but now I really want to seek out their other works! Each story is unique, there's style for miles and this is definitely not for the faint of heart.",1465862400,4,743,4.593984962406015
7689122,1,B01CRIWR0S,"Trying to watch what is happening on screen and attempting to read subtitles at the same time is extremely distracting. I wish Amazon would label such films as ""foreign language"". If they did, I wouldn't pop them into my watchlist.",1493683200,,231,4.8
7689123,5,B01CRIWR0S,"This is the top notch of German Horror ""Kunst"". What a treat! Fantastic stories, direction, and well budgeted. A true Jewel, don't miss this one! a cut above the rest!!",1491868800,2,168,4.633333333333334
7689124,3,B01CRIWR0S,"I saw the polarizing reviews and thought I would give it a try. People referred to the gore and violence as being ""extreme"" or ""brutal"" and made this sound like it was something out of the ordinary. Well, it isn't.
This is an anthology film with three stories directed by three different directors and with three different casts. They aren't related in any way.
If you have watched any modern horror in the last decade, you probably have seen worse. We do get quite a bit of full frontal nudity both male and female. It has an art house feel and a solid cast.
I watch a lot of foreign horror and I didn't see anything noteworthy here unless you are specifically a fan of German cinema.",1491436800,8,685,4.4015748031496065
7689125,5,B01CRIWR0S,"Firstly, I'd like to say it would be a shame for people to be dissuaded by the ratings. And I can totally understand how the first story of the movie would disgust or put people off. So fair warning if you are squeamish or offended by very graphic material, this is not the film for you. IF you can get past that(or enjoy it), then this movie offers a very strong cast.

I personally thought the acting was really well done, the facial expressions and general role-immersion went WAY beyond my expectations. The narrative was interesting especially in the last scene, it kind of had a Sin City vibe. The movie format seems to be segmented in to violent short stories, & I personally adore this kind of style.

There were some cheesy special fx, and I'm assuming this was a lower budget movie in comparison to other films, but the acting, the cast, & the director carried this movie. It was not the typical 'heavily carried by CGI + coupled with cheesy lines/acting', and because of this I found it very refreshing.

7689128,5,B01CRIWR0S,"I hate to bash all the one star reviews, but obviously the one stars had no idea what to expect and have been spoiled by the Hollywood mainstream.

1. Yes, this is a foreign film, the majority of this is in subtitles.
2. This is German horror cinema, is it not going to be pleasant. There will be torture, gore and sex and lots of it.
3. These are three short stories that have nothing to do with one another, so stop saying you're confused and you don't understand how they are connected.

I enjoyed the art angle of the film, the simplicity, and creativity. If you are looking for old school torture porn, supernatural elements, and grotesque effects, this baby is for you.",1485734400,,675,4.435483870967742

7689150,2,B01CRIWR0S,"Well the title is certainly apt.  One has to consider the level of anxiety felt by German filmmakers runs quite deep if indeed this is a representation of their finest horror.  Whatever merits these tales might have had were completely wasted by the gore overkill.  Like an aging man with a red Corvette, you can't help but feel these storytellers are compensating.

There are some truffles in the muck, but they are quite tiny and not worth the trash you have to sift through to find them.  An rather unfortunate statement on German horror.",1481068800,,541,4.712765957446808

8754029,3,B01CRIWR0S,"Three short films of varying quality that come together as a compilation of a German persons typical night out. The first short is mediocre, with campy cinematography and poorly communicated plotpoints that just sorta leave you saying ""Well okay then"". The second short is a commentary on the modern immigration crisis that is troubling Europe, specifically about how a ragtag gang of racists deal with their supposed opression. Interesting take on the idea with some fantasy elements that'll confuse you if you think about it's necessity to the film. The final short felt like a full length film, and had the most obviously high budget of the trio. It's a fun ride from begining to end and the lead actors voice has the phenomenal voice of a 1940's grizzled detective. Overall, 6/10, watch if you don't like ""normie"" movies",1533427200,,824,4.9352517985611515
