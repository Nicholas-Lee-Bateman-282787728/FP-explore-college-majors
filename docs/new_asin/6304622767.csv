7876907,1,6304622767,"This is probably the worst biblical film I've ever seen...boring, boring, boring.  Mickey Rooney was an extremely poor choice for his role.
I give it one star because the director had the sense to include Leonard Whiting (a very fine actor) among the cast...too bad his talent was wasted on this horrible film.  I believe Leonard Whiting retired as a movie actor following this film.  Who can blame him?  British and American movie directors were fools to let his talent slip away...a great loss for everyone who enjoys good acting on film.  Why he was not offered better roles, I will never understand.",1235088000,3,603,4.815533980582524
7876908,1,6304622767,"DO NOT LET THE PACKAGE FOOL YOU, THIS IS A BAD BIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!! I bought this movie on face value thinking it would at least  be a decent retelling of the known biblical story. I was VERY disappointed that liberties were taken in interpretation. Even 'filling in the gaps' with outragous 'dream sequences' and HERETIC scenes. Although it is based on the biblical story it is not for bible purests who are expecting a GOOD rendition of the timeless  tale. Save your money, DO NOT buy this movie. The currently  offered BIBLE 4 PACK(Ester,Soloman,Jeremiah,Genesis) is  great by contrast and would be a better use of your money. I rated this movie 1 star because the system doesn't allow any lower otherwise....",984873600,15,713,4.867768595041323
