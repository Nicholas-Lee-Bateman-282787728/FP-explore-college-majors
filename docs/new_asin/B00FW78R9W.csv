8618876,5,B00FW78R9W,"It is very rare to be able to see images of actual lab work, more rare to have them labeled.
Ths DVD is silent which I think is appropriate as you could feel the magnitude of what you are watching and knowledge being passed on to you.
Very exciting to watch.

You have wasted your time and money. RUST will not change a molten metal to Gold. It will tinge the color but when tested it will he nothing. Unfortunately Steve is a liar and a con. He is no better than all the others who have claimed to transmute metals into Silver and Gold. I followed Steve for years but he has revealed his true nature to me. He stoops low to try and destroy anyone who speaks the truth against him. Reminds me of Nicholas D Collette. That guy was quite the character as well and things ended very badly for him as I suspect Steve will end up destroying himself as well. Stay away from Steve and his circus.",1382227200,,757,4.156462585034014
