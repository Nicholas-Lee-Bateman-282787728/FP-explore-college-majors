8183829,5,B00005RYPU,"We have a couple of this series now, the Construction site and Trains.  I took the train one to a ski trip and the adults were even interested in it.  This series is done in a visual format very easy for my then 2 1/2yr old (now 4) to watch, understand and enjoy.  To this day he still goes to the video draw and chooses The MM at the construction site, as a favorite.  The format is set up as if the machine is talking directly to him.  This series is based from the Toronto area and is a quality product.  I could not recommend anything more for this age range.  It's not just a mindless video.",1080604800,3,596,4.042735042735043
8183830,5,B00005RYPU,"Despite the reviews of boring from Amazon, the whole series has never ceased to entertain and educate my children whose ages range from 3 - 12 years.  All of them sit glued to the tv for the entire show and then spend hours talking about it and role playing it.  What a great series of videos.  Their faves are at the race track and, of course, at the demolition site.",1040256000,9,368,4.228571428571429
