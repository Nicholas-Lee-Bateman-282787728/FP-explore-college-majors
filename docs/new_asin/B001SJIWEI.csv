Richard Dix (1893-1949) was RKOs leading man during the 30s. He started in 1917 and had made 50 films prior to talkies. In this film he plays a famous Australian gentleman outlaw.

Irene Dunne (1898-1990) plays a servant in a wealthy household run by Henry Stephenson. Dunne was nominated 5 times for an Oscar (Cimarron, Theodora Goes Wild, The Awful Truth, Love Affair. I Remember Mama) but never won. She made 40 films between 1930 and 1952 and then transitioned to TV. She was known as an actress and a singer, which is evident from this film.

Henry Stephenson (1871-1956) is everyone's favorite uncle. He started in the silent era and often played opposite Errol Flynn as a Governor, Lord, or Duke in films such as ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""Prince and the Pauper"" (1937), and ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939). He appeared in several Tarzan movies as an archeologist or explorer. In this film he plays the wealthy head of household where Dunne works.

Andy Devine (1905-77) made over 400 films, include several with John Wayne (Stagecoach, Liberty Valance), but perhaps is best remembered as Guy Madisons sidekick in TVs The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickock (1951  1958). He plays a sidekick to Stingaree.

Reginald Owen (1887-1972) has a small part as the Governor General of Australia. Hes best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from A Christmas Carol (1938) and made nearly 100 films including Mary Poppins (1964) and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). He has the distinction of having played Sherlock Holmes (A Study in Scarlet) as well as Dr. Watson (Sherlock Holmes

Una OConnor (1880-1959) plays Dunnes maid. She was a terrific actress who made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1957. She was a true scene stealer and did so in films such as The Invisible Man (1933), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), and The Adventure of Robin Hood (1938).

William Wild Bill Wellman (1986-1975) directs. Wellman was nominated 4 times for an Oscar, winning for Best Writer in 1938 (A Star is Born). He was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA for The High and the Mighty (1954). Among his notable films were Wings (1927), Public Enemy (1931), Beau Geste (1939), The Ox Bow Incident (1943), and Battleground (1949).  This is a big change of pace for people who like Wellman films, and may be a little less than the others.

The NY Times called it a pleasant narration of a highly improbable fablehowever, is nicely done and therefore its impossible happenings are highly entertaining.

1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to Viva Villa, Cleopatra and The Barretts of Wimpole Street and It Happened One Night was the big Oscar winner. That year The Thin Man series began, Karloff and Legosi appeared in The Black Cat, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in The Gay Divorcee, Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in Babes in Toyland,  and Howard Hawks Twentieth Century came out.

Its certainly a treat to see so many RKO characters in one film, but the film itself is a bit silly. Im a big fan of all the actors as well as the director, but their considerable skills are on display to better results elsewhere.",1444176000,3,3209,4.770758122743683
