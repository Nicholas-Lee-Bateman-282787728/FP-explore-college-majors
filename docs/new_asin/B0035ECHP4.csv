4070173,5,B0035ECHP4,I was very pleased with the dvd when I received it .. But I paid for expedited shipping and it took a week to get it. I wasn't very happy to have paid for the faster shipping.,1275091200,,175,3.7567567567567566
4070174,4,B0035ECHP4,"So Ghost hunters season 5 is a great DVD, However as I have read many blogs on the internet about faking evidence and the TAPS team not telling the truth.  I hope this is not true!  The TAPS team does a great job with investigations they are detailed and and very professional.  I do not like how they say they will do anything to help the military out.  Many of my fellow soldier friends have sent them letters with no response.  Ghost Hunters has become kind of like a residual haunting its the same thing over and over again they need to come up with some new ideas for the show and are losing viewers.  I am a die hard fan but am losing intrest and will probally not buy the next season unless they change some things.  I think that if the TAPS team is hitting on something good they should stay with it many times they were communicating with a ""GHOST"" and they were like ok lets move on.  I do not understand this the whole meaning of the show is to try to communicate with the paranormal and when you finally do it you get up and move on to another area of the place you are investagating it just does not make sense.  Over all I would recommend it to someone who is intersted in the paranormal.",1273449600,13,1202,4.1688311688311686
4070175,5,B0035ECHP4,"I purchased this set the first day it was released and watched the whole 3 Dvd's in two days.  They caught more in part two then in part one.  But I Love this show, I never want it to end.  And having Meatloaf as a guest on the Island was Awesome.  Keep it up guys.  Love the Shadow Figures.",1272585600,,291,3.864406779661017
4070176,5,B0035ECHP4,"If you like the paranormal, Ghost Hunters is a must have DVD collection. I am working on getting the entire series, myself.",1270252800,,123,4.636363636363637

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

4070189,4,B0035ECHP4,"I love this show, so I'm happy I bought this. I've just always had issues with the way the DVD menus are. I don't understand why when an episode ends it always goes back to the first episode on the dvd menu. Logically it should go to the next episode like every other tv show dvd I own. There is no option to ""play all"" for the episodes or even the bonus features, so I'm literally writing what bonus feature I'm on, so I don't skip any on accident since it also goes back to the first one when one ends.

Like I said, I love this show, and it's worth purchasing. The dvd menu can just be a pain in the butt. lol.",1421366400,,613,3.943548387096774

4070210,1,B0035ECHP4,...this is a fun series but I keep getting bad discs. Somebody needs to look into whomever is producing these things.,1363132800,,117,4.619047619047619

4070214,5,B0035ECHP4,"OMG!!  I LOVE these guys and all their shows.  I thought Season 7 and 6 were really good.  Well, 5 is blowing my mind!!  (Yes, I actually have been watching them backwards.  Don't ask. lol)

Anyways, I think any skeptic out there can't dispute some of the episodes in this Season.  If you do, I'd like to hear why, which episode and how you came to the ""debunking"" decision.  :)  Yup, that is a challenge.

I highly recommend this Season and all the others as well.  :)",1351728000,,469,4.275862068965517
4070215,1,B0035ECHP4,"Honestly, if I could give this ZERO STARS I would. Don't waste your time or money.
This show should have been cancelled several years ago as it has really gotten boring. People always write how exciting the so-called 'big reveal' is at the end of the show. What big reveal? All that's ever talked about are personal experiences and noises that were heard!!! Needless to say, their 'evidence' is ALWAYS crap. Find something better to do with your time! WATCH GHOST ADVENTURES AND SEE THE REAL THING!",1300665600,2,498,4.735632183908046

4070217,3,B0035ECHP4,This is a great show. However the dvd had a problem. The 1st one we received had a constant  low humming/buzzing background noise. We exchanged it for a 2nd copy. THAT one had the same problem! We requested and received a refund. A bad manufacturing run perhaps?,1296777600,2,262,4.574468085106383
4070218,3,B0035ECHP4,"I have been a fan of the show since the beginning and still consider myself one, but it appears that they are getting less enthused with each season and things appear more controlled. I think the rumors of fakery are not helping the show in the least plus all the offshoots shows and the diluting of the cast. DVD quality was good.",1289865600,7,331,4.354838709677419
4070219,4,B0035ECHP4,"I'm not sure what happened between the release of Season 4 and Season 5 of this show but someone thought it would be a great idea to make these dvd's not work in my dvd player. I have to watch them on my laptop if I want the dvd's to work. I have a TV with a built in dvd player and most of the time it works perfectly. But I noticed that it will not play or has a very hard time reading the Season 5 Ghost Hunters discs. Are they using a new format or something?

I love this show but I waited a long time before deciding to buy Season 5 part 2 because of the poor quality of the dvds. They should play in ANY player, not just SOME players. It makes me think that buying and downloading the digital version of Season 6 might be better than buying the dvds.

Also they did away with the ""play it all"" feature which ticks me off because I like to have uninterrupted GH marathons. I don't like to have to pause every 45 minutes to pick the next show. Really guys, what's going on!

Love the show, hate the new DVD format.",1289174400,8,1019,3.9609756097560975
4070220,5,B0035ECHP4,"I love this show. I am not a fan of their newer spin off ""Ghost Hunter's Academy"" but this show never fails to entertain my family.  Let's face it, there is not much out their to watch.  In a world of ""Reality"" television, this one wins hands down.",1287360000,,248,4.145833333333333

4070222,5,B0035ECHP4,if you are an avid ghost beliver and skeptic at the same time you need to watch these videos. they are awesome and will totally keep you wanting more. In these videos the team go in to try to debunk a story and when they can't they are left to wonder what. A definite must have.,1277856000,,278,3.982142857142857
