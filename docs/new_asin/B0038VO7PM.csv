4092366,4,B0038VO7PM,"""Seven Angry Men"" (1955) is the tale of the rise and fall of Civil War era abolitionist John Brown. It stars Raymond Massey (1896-1983) who played the role in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Massey is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln - ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940), ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950), and ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Philip of Spain in ""Fire Over England"", Black Michael in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum""). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films and I never saw a bad performance.

Petite Debra Paget (1933) is best known for her role in films like ""Broken Arrow"" (1950), ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) and ""Love me Tender"" (1956). She plays the girl friend/wife of one of Brown's sons played by Jeff Hunter.

Ultra handsome Jeffrey Hunter (1926-69) plays one of Brown's sons. Hunter is best remembered for playing Jesus in ""King of Kings"" (1961) but I think his best performance was in ""The Searchers"" (1956). He was originally considered for the lead in TV ""Star Trek"" series and appears in the original pilot as ""Captain Pike"".

BTW - Hunter and Paget were teamed in 5 films during the 50s and even co-anchored a TV show.

Dennis Weaver (1924-2006) plays John Brown Jr.  Weaver is best known for his years on ""Gunsmoke"" as Chester and his detective series ""McCloud"", but he also had a distinguished career in films such as ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), ""The Gallant Hours"" (1960) and ""Duel"" (1971). He received two Emmy nominations for ""Gunsmoke"" and for ""McCloud"" and won once (1955).

Guy Williams (1924-89) plays another son. Williams is best known from the TV series ""Zorro"" (1957-9) and ""Lost in Space"" (1965-8).

James Edwards (1918-70) plays a freed man. Edwards is best remembered for his outstanding performance as the shell shocked soldier in ""Home of the Brave"" (1949). He made nearly 50 films from 1949 to 1972, and was active on TV with recurring roles on ""Dr Kildare"" (1965) and ""Burke's Law"" (1966).

Director Charles Marquis Warren (1912-90) specialized in westerns for film (""Little Big Horn"", ""Arrowhead"") and TV (""Gunsmoke"", ""Rawhide"", ""The Virginian"").

Massey was 59 when he made this film, which was the same age of Brown when he was killed. Brown's efforts were one of the major causes of the Civil War. Though he is often depicted as a crazed abolitionist, most historians consider him a highly principled zealot who was willing to sacrifice everything to remove the blight of slavery. He was praised by such eminent contemporaries as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman. His dying words were ""I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.""

In addition to Raymond Massey who played John Brown on film and on stage, Brown has been played by John Cromwell (""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", 1940), singer Johnny Cash (""North and South"", 1985), Royal Dano (""Skin Game"", 1971), Sterling Hayden (""The Blue and the Grey"", 1982). Of the lot, Massey is clearly #1, but Dano and Hayden also did very well.

In 1955 the top grossing films were ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"". The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress).

The main value of this film is that it is one of the few reasonable attempts to portray the life of John Brown in a balanced manner. We see him in Kansas trying to fight the slavers, in Massachusetts with his family, in New England raising money, in Harpers Ferry trying to foment revolution, and finally at the end when he bravely faces the hangman's noose. We see his compassion, wisdom, and love while at the same time, his stubbornness, bad temper and his willingness to go to any extreme in pursuit of his goal of ending slavery.",1305590400,5,4092,4.813390313390314

4092368,1,B0038VO7PM,"This is not a review of the movie only the Retro Flix DVD.

The picture quality is terrible. There is no picture in some spots only a black screen. The print looks like it must be one that originally ran in theatres in 1955 and has been playing since. Full of scratches, dirt, splices, etc. It also looks like it is taken from a video tape. There is a lack of any detail. It is 4:3 aspect ratio. I have seen this movie on TV and the picture quality was much better.

I guess this must be in the public domain, although I think the Allied Artists library is owned by Time Warner. I have seen this movie on TV and the picture quality was much better.

The box art is colorful, taken from the movie poster artwork, although the layout is very amateurishly presented. There is no menu but there are chapter breaks every 5 mins.

I'm only writing this to prepare anyone purchasing this disc -- so they will not be disappointed upon receiving it. BTW - the movie itself is not too bad.",1268438400,12,979,4.247311827956989

8391811,5,B0038VO7PM,"A good film rendering of John Brown's misguided crusade against slavery.  Raymond Massey gives a stellar performance as usual, his second portrayal of Brown (he also played the role in Sante Fe Trail starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan.)  Jeffrey Hunter does a decent job as Brown's ever loyal son, Owen, who supports his father over the objections of the woman he loves (a bit overplayed by Debra Paget) until the end when he leaves him to his fate. Larry Pennell portrays conflicted son Oliver who eventually joins up for good to avenge his brother's death.  Dennis Weaver gives a decent performance as the emotionally weak son John although it's a small role.  The shootout at the arsenal in Harper's Ferry is brief and the trial is dramatically filmed with shadows on the wall showing rain running down the windows and thunder sounding at the reading of the verdict after Brown's impassioned speech.  After Owen's return with a last ditch effort to save dear old dad, John Brown bravely mounts the gallows as the music swells to a crescendo.  All in all, a dated but decent movie about a misguided fanatic who saw what was coming for this country.",1496966400,,1154,4.773869346733668

8391813,4,B0038VO7PM,"Although it plays a certain amount of hob with the actual ages of the sons of famed Kansas abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey), and sketches his career only briefly, this black-and-white biopic at least includes all of the ones who lived long enough to take part in the ""troubles"" of the mid-to-late 1850's (no mention is made of the six daughters he also fathered).  Soon after the creation of the Kansas Territory as an entity whose fate--""slave"" or ""free""--was to be settled by its people, two of Brown's eight surviving boys, Owen (Jeffrey Hunter) and Oliver (Larry Pennell), return from a long visit to their mother and kin back East to join their father and brothers at the crude settlement of ""free-staters"" that Brown has founded at Ossawatomie.  On the train Owen meets and falls for Elizabeth Clark (Debra Paget, who in the same year also appeared with Hunter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Feather/dp/B000NO1XMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Feather</a>), whose father has established a newspaper in Lawrence, but despite the anti-slavery sentiments they share, she can't bring herself to approve of Brown's fanaticism.  When Martin White (Leo Gordon), a pro-slavery man who has already clashed with the Browns, leads a raid on the town and Mr. Clark is killed, the Browns take Elizabeth in--and retaliate with a bloody attack on several other pro-slavers who had nothing to do with the incident.  John Jr. (Dennis Weaver) is so shattered by this event that brother Jason (James Best) fears for his sanity and takes him to the Army, planning to surrender and seek treatment for him, while Frederick (John Smith), seeking solitude in which to mull over what has happened and how he should react, is killed by a band of ""border ruffians.""  Yet over time Owen and Elizabeth finally find that they can overcome their differences, especially after the ""free-soil"" Territorial constitution is approved by Congress.  But Brown hasn't shot his wad yet: he's determined to do something really big to force the issue of freedom for the slaves.  Though inevitably somewhat sketchy, the movie does manage to put a human face on a part of American history now forgotten by most people, and while Brown is never really sympathetic, he's at least understandable; it's his sons (six of them, including Salmon (Guy Williams), played by young men who were to go on to busy careers on screens large and small) who really engage the viewer's caring.",1451433600,,2501,5.221945137157107
