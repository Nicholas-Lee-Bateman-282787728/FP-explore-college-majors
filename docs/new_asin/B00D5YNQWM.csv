5775029,3,B00D5YNQWM,"I agree with the previous reviewers in that this is an awesome concert by the group. They are absolutely on fire and the video and sound is excellent.  The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is that the interruptions with the interviews between songs.  Were it not for that, I would have given 5 stars.  I wish they would release a ""deluxe"" version where the entire show is not interrupted and the interviews are in bonus material.  It would be nice to put this DVD on at a party and not worry about having to pick up the remote to skip the interviews.",1374796800,30,551,4.269230769230769
5775030,3,B00D5YNQWM,"The other reviewers were accurate. This DVD/blu ray is great for the casual fans who enjoy Aerosmith's deeper tracks. It has great visuals and great sound and Aerosmith's performance is great.

As a huge fan I was completely disappointed that they showed only the last section of Hangman Jury. It was one of the reasons I was looking forward to this video. I love the song and was looking forward to seeing it and was extremely unhappy that they cut the first 3/4's of the song! Why did they even include it in the movie at all?

I was also annoyed by the fact that this has the same snippy style as the You Gotta Move DVD: Every 2-3 seconds the camera angle changes and it's hard for me to pay attention to what's going on. I can't stand these concert videos that change to different cameras with every blink of the eye. I kept wanting to see more of Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer. Every time it focused on one of them, it would cut to another so fast that I couldn't focus on the cool moments these guys were giving.

As a fan of the band members as well as their music, I enjoyed the interview parts. But the interviews were so short. I don't really understand why some people are complaining, saying that this isn't a concert DVD because of the interview segments. A large majority of Rock For The Rising Sun is the concert part. I actually would have liked more interviews. I did enjoy the behind-the-scenes segments.

I think the song selection is great (I wish they would play some of those deeper cuts live in the US - not only Japan!). They played extremely well and I was happy with their performance. The sound quality is awesome. I would  have rated this 5 stars if only the cameras didn't switch so often, and if only they included all of Hangman Jury! The hardcore fans will be happy to see these ""more rare"" songs but there's nothing really exciting to see that we haven't seen before. It's Aerosmith, who is awesome, but I just wasn't blown away.",1374710400,14,2001,4.426630434782608
5775031,3,B00D5YNQWM,"The other reviews pretty much sum it up.
On buying this it has no mention on the sleeve of a tour documentary.
To be fair it is more of a concert film and some of the interviews inbetween tracks are annoying.
Another thing is the first half of Hangman Jury is cut.
Also where the hell are tracks like Jaded and Dream On???
The whole thing runs at 1 hour 34 mins.

On the plus side the picture and audio are exceptional.
It is on a par with Led Zeppelin's Celebration Day and the live feel is fantastic.
It makes you really wish for a full on uncut, no interviews, live show release.
Considering they spent all that money filming in HD and recording each show then releasing this
it makes you wonder the decisions made by management/record company.
Saying this I'd still recommend it.

NOTE - I have e-mailed [...] requesting they release an uncut & no interviews between songs full show.
If we all e-mail them maybe they'll get the hint!!!!",1374624000,4,940,4.427745664739884
5775032,5,B00D5YNQWM,This is the best live concert Blu-Ray to come out in years.  A must-have for any rock 'n' roll fan.,1374537600,2,99,3.95
5775033,3,B00D5YNQWM,"Although not yet released in the US, this title has been on sale in Japan since mid-June (and I managed to purchase a Blu-ray copy there during my recent trip). Filmed in Japan back in 2011 (while the country was still recovering from its earthquake/tsunami tragedy), this concert film is pretty much the band's tribute to their legion of Japanese fans.

On the positive side, the performances are awesome and very nicely filmed (as one would expect from seeing Aerosmith performing live). And the focus here is more on the 'hard rock' songs from the band's catalogue (none of those cheesy ballads that they have become so famous for since the 1990s... don't worry, that irritating song from ""Armageddon"" is not here). So, if you prefer the harder and 'bluesier' side of the band, this one is for you. It is possible though that some fans may be unhappy about the omission of some of the band's better-known songs from this collection (eg. ""Janie's Got A Gun"", ""Dream On"", etc). The Japanese edition contains 4 bonus tracks (""Train Kept a Rollin"" - full version, ""Lord of the Thighs"", ""Lick and a Promise"" and ""One Way Street"") but I am not sure whether these are included in the US release.

Now, to the negatives. Although I love the performances here, I really hate how this Blu-ray is organized. First of all, this is a 'collection of performances' from various shows rather than a single complete show. Ok, there's nothing wrong with this from my perspective... however, why on earth do they have to mix short interviews/comments/tour footage in-between almost every song??? WHY, WHY, WHY??? Most of us buy a live DVD/Blu-ray because we want to watch the band perform... we want a continuous, non-stop 2-hour live show. Instead, there is disruption after every song with all those interviews, comments, etc. This has been promoted as a concert film and so it should have been released as such. At least, the disc menu should include an option that allows the viewer to decide whether to play only the live performances or to play everything. Or, why not put together those interviews and commentaries as a separate 'Japanese tour' documentary? Why mix everything together? After all the complaints received for their previous concert release (""You Gotta Move"" DVD), this latest release has not only repeated the same mistake but has multiplied it by ten times (now we get an interruption after every song, and this means that most of us are unlikely to leave this in our Blu-ray or DVD player for repeated viewing, simply because it is so damn irritating!).

'5 stars' for the songs and performances. BUT... '0 star' for the Blu-ray!!!",1372723200,100,2640,4.849223946784923
5775034,5,B00D5YNQWM,"This video is terrific.  Well shot and edited, Rock for the Rising Sun can well attest that Aerosmith continues to be a great live band.

Put together in a very thoughtful way, the interviews are interspersed with performance footage in a way that one does not distract from the other.

We all know that Aerosmith has a great deep catalog.  This video shows how the band can still riff on these classic grooves in a way that is new and exciting.  Steven Tyler also adds to the lyrics in a very playful manner; and to see him interact and even at times direct the band into grooves and then signal to the crew to catch it is simply amazing.

The whole band is up to snuff in a big fun and funky way.
It's simply a joy to watch.",1440979200,,726,4.18705035971223

These guys are the real deal, they have a passion for rock music, and are great performers.  In this Blu-ray concert you will see the best of Aerosmith in concert as well as see capsules of their experience touring Japan's cities and cultures, while interacting with Japanese and fans who traveled from around the world to see them abroad.  Note:  There are one to two-minute clips from the band experiencing the cities of Japan in between each song (you can't watch the musical performance without seeing the documentary clips in between songs) -- I think the documentary clips combined with outstanding concert performances make this film very unique and not a negative (unlike some reviewers).  The video and audio quality, as well as the band's performance are amazing.  I would not hesitate to recommend this Blu-ray to any true Aerosmith fan.

5775065,5,B00D5YNQWM,"Highly entertaining documentary/concert film takes place shortly after the tragic tsunami that struck Japan. Months later Aerosmith went on a tour of the country and we follow them along as they tour the various cities during the day and rock the arenas by night. I've seen Aerosmith nearly a dozen times over the past decade and to say their recent shows have been ""different"" would be an understatement. If you're familiar with their message boards then you're going to notice quite a few negative posts about setlists, missed shows and various other issues but ROCK FOR THE RISING SUN is a winner no matter what you think. There's a great mixture of concert footage plus just behind-the-scenes stuff as the band members walk around the cities before the shows and there's also some great stuff dealing with the band backstage as they talk about setlists and other items. I think fans of the band are really going to enjoy these behind-the-scenes stuff as one really gets to see what it's like just minutes before they hit the stage. As for the concert footage, it's all shot extremely well and we're given a great setlist as well. Favorites like ""Walk This Way,"" ""Love in an Elevator,"" ""Livin' on the Edge,"" ""Last Child"" and ""Sweet Emotion"" are all here sounding wonderful. The real joy comes from some lesser played tracks like ""Hangman Jury,"" ""No More No More,"" ""Movin' Out"" and ""S.O.S. (Too Bad)."" These songs here make the entire thing worth sitting through. Fans of the band will certainly enjoy this one for years to come.",1395619200,,1531,4.803030303030303

5775076,4,B00D5YNQWM,"This DVD proves that Aerosmith is still an excellent band and can rock with the best of them.  On of the reasons I bought the DVD was the set list, which was heavy on Toys inthe Attic and Rocks period songs (I am 51 and grew up on them).  There were no recent power ballands and even some old gems like One Way Street in the bonus section.  It is a performance (or parts of performances) of a band givings its all.  My reservations:  while I liked most of the interludes and interviews, I really wish bands would stop sticking them between songs, and even cutting into the start of a couple songs.  Also, when I Brad for much of the video?  He comes out in the end (they play Last Child, so he has too), but it seems it doesn't get much camera time or even always a spotlight.  Mostly Steven and Joe, with a lot of Joey.  Not bad, and I know who the faces of the band are, but Brad is such a great guitarist in his own right.  Maybe he doesn't want the spotlight, but him and Tom are worth a bit more time.",1386806400,,1006,4.0353535353535355
5775077,5,B00D5YNQWM,"Review no. 43. Seventeen song live Aerosmith performance, that took place roughly a year prior to the last time I was fortunate enough to catch Steven Tyler and crew play live. 'Rock For The Rising Sun' most certainly brought back some priceless memories for me. Loved hearing / experiencing those Aerosmith -gems- once again like the awesome opener ""Draw The Line"", their late '80's FM radio staple ""Love In An Elevator"", their early rocker ""Mama Kin"", ""Monkey On My Back"", one of my personal favorites ""Toys In The Attic"", ""Last Child"" and the rest. One unfamiliar song here (to me) is ""Boogie Man"" is notably a tune that Aerosmith had penned out while in rehearsal in their studio.

The only don fall is, they have commentary betewen songs, when it should have been a straight live show, without any interruptions, and had the commentary and other footage unto itself. I hate it when bands do this, drives me absolutely farging crazy! Kiss is notorious for this, but their egos are out of control and they feel some uncontrollable desire to do this. I digress here, excuse me please. I love Aerosmith, always have, always will, though I wish they would rock as hard as they di back in the day, I. E., Toys, Rocks, etc.. Guitars had edge back then and they walked it, like they talked it, tougher back then. They still have it and are still one of the greatest American bands this country has ever produced. Do I recommend this, yes, it's finally a decent Aerosmith show caught on tape. Like I said, the down side to this is, the interspersed commentary between songs.

This would be when the ""toxic twins"" were at their highest high or lowest low...ya know what I mean. Because of that show I have held a grudge and never attended another Aerosmith show since. What a mistake! This disc kicks butt! Yes the interviews are annoying and cutting some songs into snippets is a drag but when they do play....HOLY WOW!!! This band really can put on one helluva show. The audio is fantastic, at some points you actually feel like your in the arena at the show. Feeling the tempo rise up and up with a wee bit of reverb from the building. Fantastic.

5775092,3,B00D5YNQWM,"The sound and quality are excellent; the band pours their hearts out in concert- that is, what we see of the concert.  Steven, Joe, Brad, Tom and Joey perform with gusto and fever; however any hardcore Aerofan will be somewhat disappointed by the flow of the video and especially the ending.  Why ruin one of the greatest songs recorded by this group as the ending credits, and cut off the song, just playing a tease of the beginning minute? Train Kept A Rollin is usually an encore, we look forward to it as a sexy treat at the end of Aerosmiths concerts (just as we do to Dream On).  Only showing a minute of footage is a disgrace for fans and a waste.  This wasn't the only low point of the film.  I do sympathize with the people that suffered such devastation but they didn't need to be playing guitar.  Let's leave that to the Bad Boys of Boston.
The setlist was great, but as a true fan who has seen over 40 Aerosmith concerts, I was a bit disappointed.  Don't leave me hangin!  I own Texas Jam, The NYC Robinhood Benefit Concert, Aerosmith Unplugged and a shelf of other proshot Aero dvds, and I prefer all of them to this one.

Sorry but really tired of seeing these 2 made to be the stars of this band. I met Joe P he's rude & unsociable. Steven I get he's charismatic lead singer etc. I would have loved to have seen interviews with the ""band"". Brad is a much better player than Joe. Tom adorable. Joey a machine & powerful player.

Steven Tyler is amazing and Joe Perry is Smokin Hot Mmmmm!! We had a blast watching it! It is a Great Addition to my library. If you like Aerosmith you are missing out by not grabbing a copy of this for yourself. BUY IT.,1376352000,,396,4.293333333333333
5775103,5,B00D5YNQWM,"This band never ceases to amaze. After all these years they still give a high octane ROCK N ROLL performance. The music we all know, no need to comment on that. The opener ""Draw The Line"" is a great choice. Steven Tyler's entrance on the stage leaves no doubt that he is the alpha male in this band looking every bit the part of rock star. Perry as usual makes it look so easy. The rhythm section is as tight as Joey Kramer's snare. The interviews in between the songs and documentary of their visit I think is interesting and lets you in on what they experienced. I was especially moved when Tyler THANKED the two servicemen for keeping our country safe. If some people want to whine like a bunch of (fill in the blank) about the interviews and commentary in between songs, go ahead on. Man up dog.",1376092800,,799,4.333333333333333
5775104,5,B00D5YNQWM,Am a die hard Aerosmith fan and this DVD really puts together some of their best work! I appreciate that they went to Japan and donated their makings to the relief campaign going on there at the time. Hope the proceeds make it to people in need!,1376006400,,245,4.23404255319149
5775105,5,B00D5YNQWM,"Amazing piece of work, Casey Tebo!  We all believe in you now!  Hoping for many, many more of these.  Aerosmith is an incredible band, still looking and sounding fantastic!!  Loved the ""off the stage"" footage.  Thanks again, Casey, for taking the initiative.  Great job, Aerosmith!",1375747200,,281,5.133333333333334
5775106,5,B00D5YNQWM,"You can't even tell this wasn't intended to be a film. The director (Casey Tebo) did such a great job with cameras and footage it's unbelievable! He did a wonderful job with what he had available! You can see the band is in their best time, they look smokin' and you can tell they are having fun up in stage!

The song selection, I think is the best thing about this film. Unlike other works of this kind that focus on hits and ballads, Casey focused on deep cuts, rockers: EXACTLY WHAT US, HARDCORE FANS, WERE WAITING. Dream On, isn't on the setlist (my favorite song) but guess what, I don't care, and I must admit you have to have balls to do that, so I applaud you for that Casey! Best part, is you can tell Casey knows the band, knows the songs and he focuses on right moments to make close ups to certain band members, guitar parts, drums, etc. One thing I love, is how natural the whole film is, since they weren't aware this was going to have this kind of use, you can see flaws and that makes it beautiful and unique.

Before watching the movie, I read lots of comments from people complaining about the song ""cuts"", I'm gonna have to disagree with these kind of comments by saying I don't think they are ""cuts"", first of all this is a CONCERT FILM, so it is ok to do this ""fadings"" (I rather call them that way). I personally think it's really nice to see how they rehearse ""Hangman Jury"" right on the dressing room, after not playing it since what it feels like FOREVER, and not just the final product live on concert, YOU CAN FIND THAT ON YOUTUBE, right? And besides, you could complain about that if it was a Live DVD in which of course you won't find this stuff. Same with those complains about why using the footage of different shows and not just one. There was a story behind this film.

AND PLEASE, STOP SAYING THE FILM IS THE SAME ""MISTAKE"" AS YGM, PLEASE. JUST, NO.

As for the emotional side, this film brought so many different emotions to me. I felt really moved and touched by the fans and the things they said. I could see myself in many of them, and I loved the fact they were involved in the movie. To be able to see how the band brought peace and joy, to a country that was devastated in sadness and fear, felt my heart deeply and it proved me once again WHY I am a fan to this amazing rockband and WHY I have devoted my life to it. Im proud to say Aerosmith is MY PASSION.

To finish, Casey did a great job! Quality of picture and audio is insane. I cant wait to see more of his work with the band. Hopefully new concert films from places they have been and where they are really loved as well LIKE SOUTHAMERICA ;) you've got pretty good hardcore fans down here, and we would love to share our experiences too!

As a suggestion (cause no one has the right to tell Casey how to do his job) is maybe if possible in future materials add more songs, or interviews as bonus. Nothing more, I deeply admire his work, I've seen him working live with my own eyes and think he is the ONE for this! Can't think of another person.

So, THANK YOU CASEY and looking forward for more!

5775107,2,B00D5YNQWM,"...yesterday. Very disappointed by this release. One of the main reasons I picked it up was because I was impressed by the fact that the band went to Japan after the events the country went through. This doesn't mean I want to see it during the concert at the expense of a few songs. Worst of all, they cut off ""Train Kept A Rollin'""!!! This will probably end up being sold back to a store for a few bucks.",1375660800,6,406,4.151898734177215
5775108,3,B00D5YNQWM,"This product is all well and good but as an aside, are we ever going to see some of the full pro shot concerts from the 70s that show the Boys From Boston in their prime? We all know from the video scrapbook VHS that was released in the 80s that these shows exist and in pretty decent quality too. Who wouldn't want to see a box set featuring the full show from the Detroit Silverdome from '76 of the CalJam from '78 released? I don't know, maybe this a Leber/Krebs issue and we may never get to see these gems ever, Shame.",1375488000,,523,4.087378640776699
5775109,4,B00D5YNQWM,"First off, I own a few hundred concert dvd's.  I've seen it all.  I don't like what many people don't like - too many rapidly changing camera angles, incomplete songs, etc.  This concert video has some of that.  Incomplete songs are unusual for a concert dvd and I'm not sure why Aerosmith did this for the Rising Sun video.  Some songs actually began already a minute or two into them.  Strange but it is what it is.  The glass, however, is way more than half full in my opinion.  First off, most of the songs in the concert video are complete.  More than that, the entire band thoroughly enjoyed themselves and put in a very spirited and passionate performance.  The songs weren't (thankfully) played by the numbers.  Instead, there were imaginative passages within the songs and many were extended, including longer jams and solos.  Many concert videos are doctored and fixed.  Pay attention to Steven Tyler's vocals.  His vocals were amazing.  No doctoring here.  I cannot believe a 60-something can sing that consistently and well from beginning to end of a concert.  He sang better here than he did at his peak of performing in the 70's.  After seeing this concert, I was not bothered that much by the short interviews in between songs because the performance of those songs played blew me away at times and exceeded my fairly high expectations.  So, for those who want a complete concert without interruption, be grateful for what you did get - one of their more old school set lists played with immediacy and purpose.  These guys still care a lot and obviously hold themselves to lofty standards as far as their concert performances.  As far as the audio and video goes, the audio was very good.  The video did, at certain times, have flourishes of way too many camera angle changes but there were a lot of extended shots as well.  There were many times during many songs when the cameras were about as relaxed as you can get for a concert video.  Picture quality for Rising Sun was above average compared to other blu-ray concert dvd's that I own.  It is, without a doubt, worth purchasing.",1375401600,4,2099,4.669398907103825
5775110,5,B00D5YNQWM,"Casey Patrick Tebo did an amazing job capturing concert footage from Aerosmith's shows in Japan in 2011 and he got some amazing moments of the band out and about enjoying Japan.

5775111,2,B00D5YNQWM,"I am very surprised after the criticism of the last release, that the same formula was used again. The quality of sound, picture and performance are certainly 5 star. The set-list for me is fantastic. I can even deal with the interviews between songs although it is completely annoying. What is unforgivable is NOT PLAYING THE SONGS IN FULL! This artsy amateur hour of presenting this concert/documentary is a tried and true recipe for failure. Some songs are presented as snippets. Beginning chopped on Toys in the Attic, Hangman Jury gets the half treatment, and the ultimate kick in the groin...Train kept a Rollin partly played over the credits. It's 2013! Please, knock it off with this crap! The Blu-ray disc holds 50 Gig of info. Certainly more than enough to play full songs, considering how short the set-list is. Mccartney has done this with several releases and finally wised up with his latest. Producers need to take note that fans hate this nonsense.

5775112,5,B00D5YNQWM,"As a long time Aerosmith fan, I was happy to see them do a concert video.  And what better than when they went to Japan in 2011 after the earthquake and tsunami there earlier in the year.  I was extremely pleased with the documentary style used since they went out among the people there letting them know they were there for them, did sightseeing and also provided entertainment. Casey Patrick Tebo caught the essence of the band. Showed them as the great performers they are but also as people. Some of the scenes outside of the performing were funny and some were more somber (Hiroshima).  The performances were excellent.",1374969600,,625,4.715596330275229
5775113,5,B00D5YNQWM,"I have been waiting for a Aerosmith to release a full-length concert video for quite sometime now. I have been wondering how a band that is known for its live performances could go so long without such a release, but finally it is here and to my surprise it contains mostly their older hard-hitting classics with not a single ballad! If you are a fan of Aerosmith's earlier material this is a must have. Many will complain about the absence of ""Dream On"" but for me it is not missed because this is not a set of hits, its much better than that. That said, ""Back in the Saddle"" would have fit in this set list quite nicely. Everyone will likely have several songs that they would have liked to see included, but when you consider the fact that one would be hard-pressed to find a bad song on any of Aerosmith's earlier albums, combined with the fact that many of their lesser known classics are included, such as ""One Way Street,"" ""Draw the Line,"" and ""Moving Out,"" you will not be left disappointed when all is said and done. For me, it really stirs up the same sensation that I felt seeing the band play live in the early 80s.

I am not sure what some other reviewers are talking about with their complaints about the interviews being mixed in. It is just small sound-bites in between songs, nothing over-the-top, and it all blends quite nicely. Great sound quality and HD video! I couldn't be more pleased! For those looking for a live video of hits and ballads, this is not it, and I could only imagine that will be around the corner, but as an old-time fan of their harder-hitting songs from back in the day, this is everything I could have asked for!",1374883200,5,1655,4.408496732026144

8589774,5,B00D5YNQWM,"This new DVD from Aerosmith chronicles their tour of Japan in late November 2011, just some eight months after the disastrous Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that caused widespread devastation to parts of Japan that resulted in the deaths of almost 16,000 people and the fear of radiation fallout that was bestowed on the country and it's people in the following months.

Directed by Casey Patrick Tebo, the aim of this film is to express the connection of love between Aerosmith and their fans of Japan, ""It's a beautiful thing,"" says Steven Tyler throughout the film.
