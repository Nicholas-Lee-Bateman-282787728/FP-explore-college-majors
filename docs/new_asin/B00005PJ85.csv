7949341,5,B00005PJ85,"Most amazing Motocross Video for it's time!!  Would honestly put it up against any other video made up until today.  The ""Scholars"" of yesteryear, the ""Music"", the ""Choreography"" - too many things to compliment.  This is THE ultimate Motocross video made and upsets me to NOT be able find a decent copy of it.",1507507200,,309,4.685185185185185

7949344,5,B00005PJ85,"WOW! What a video! The cinematography is fantastic and the music is just right for the video. I gave this to my 6-year-old son and he loves it! Nothing is scary but the movie is *intense*. These guys do amazing stunts on their bikes. Only one thing turned me off...one of the riders is shown in close up taking a dip of smokeless tobacco. Besides that, I highly recommend this DVD. It is entertaining and amazing to watch.",1009411200,7,422,4.423076923076923
