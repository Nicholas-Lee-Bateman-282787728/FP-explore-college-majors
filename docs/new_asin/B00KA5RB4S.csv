8656914,5,B00KA5RB4S,"ITV produced this absolutely superb thriller in 2014.  It doesn't follow the usual plotlines and keeps one guessing until the end.  The extremely talented John Simm (Life on Mars, The Lakes, State of Play, The Yellow House and many more) leads an excellent, though not well-known, cast.  I watch many British programs in this genre and this is one of the best.  There are subtitles and a 'play all' option.",1437609600,,406,4.757142857142857
8656915,5,B00KA5RB4S,"excellent show, another example of cutting cable and just watching European shows.  In Europe, they assume the viewer is intelligent; in America, they insult your intelligence.",1435449600,3,176,5.769230769230769
8656916,5,B00KA5RB4S,"This was a great mini-series.  John Simm was brilliant in his role as the heartbroken Marcus Farrow who is wrongly accused of the murder of his divorced wife and 10-year-old son.  Even as he's on the run from the law, and attempting to solve the mystery of who actually committed the crime, Simm shows just how much Farrow loves and misses his only remaining family member: his teenage son Finn.
This series had a very Fugitive-esque feel to it, and I kept expecting Tommy Lee Jones to come on screen and make his famous speech.  But Rosie Cavaliero holds her own as detective Susan Reinhart, who is put in charge of Farrow's case.  Reinhart has her own problems, with stress-eating and stalking her former husband.  It's never implicitly said, but is made obvious that their split-up was because Susan could not give him children, and you can see just how broken Susan is about it.  Added to her troubles is the responsibility of tracking down Farrow.
All in all, it was a good story, well acted, and had a very good ending.  You don't know until almost the very end whether or not Farrow will be exonerated.",1432598400,,1109,4.598984771573604
