819013,4,6304237650,"TWO SISTERS FROM BOSTON is a musical comedy about two girls from Boston who go to New York and get jobs as singers and dancers in a Bowery nightclub while trying to land a spot in the Met for one of the sisters (Kathryn Grayson). June Allyson plays the other sister and Jimmy Durante is the owner of the Bowery joint. Lauritz Melchior, Peter Lawford and Ben Blue appear in strong supporting roles. The talented cast is what makes the movie so entertaining. The plot is slightly nonsensical but it really doesn't matter in this case.
Henry Koster directed many other films including FLOWER DRUM SONG, MY MAN GODFREY and THE BISHOP'S WIFE. He was nominated for an Oscar for the latter in 1947. Lauritz Melchior was underrated as an actor and I wish that he had made more movies.",1086566400,13,776,4.55
819014,4,6304237650,"This is an entertaining lower budget MGM musical. Kathryn Grayson gets to show her sense of humor and June Allyson is charming. Miss
Grayson shows she can handle comic as well as classical music and
in my opinion is one of the most beautiful movie stars of her era. This is a well paced, funny film; the ending could have been a bit
stronger, but viewers shouldm't be disappointed. One of the best
examples of the use of opera as comedy.",1066608000,7,437,4.407407407407407
819015,5,6304237650,"June Allyson, Kathryn Grayson, Jimmy Durante, & Peter Lawford lead the cast in this charming, funny romantic musical set at the turn of the Century.
Allyson and Grayson are Martha and Abigail Chandler, two sisters from an elite conservative family in Boston. Pursuing a singing career in the opera, Abigail(Grayson) lives on her own in New York and pays for her singing lessons by singing and dancing at a bar run by the endearing Jimmy Durante.
The fun begins when Abigail's Boston relatives find out and head to New York to set her straight. Fortunately for Abigail, younger sister Martha(Allyson) comes to the rescue risking her own good girl reputation to cover for her sister and help her make it to the Grand Opera.
Peter Lawford and June Allyson are hysterical as the over conservative goody-goodies who fall for each other, Jimmy Durante gives an adorable comical performance as Abigail's boss, and Kathryn Grayson gives beautiful renditions of classical songs.
Memorable scenes include Allyson's performance of the song ""After the Show"" in a bar, and Grayson's hilarius run-in with the great opera singer Ostrum(Lauritz Melchior) as she steals his aria during a live performance.
Very funny plot and performances throughout the whole movie. Definitely worth watching and enjoying over and over again!!",1050969600,32,1310,5.183962264150943

819166,3,6304237650,"This was not one of my favorite movies for June Allyson, Kathryn Grayson or Jimmy Durante. It's not bad, but it's just not my favorite. They are all good actors in the movie, but I think the plot is just a little too weak and over done.

Martha (played by June Allyson) and her strict, socialite Boston family are shocked when a rumor that her sister, Abigail (Kathryn Grayson), is not pursuing a career in the opera in New York, as they thought, but singing in a Bowery beer hall instead. Martha, along with her aunt and uncle, decide to surprise Abigail in New York and put this rumor to rest. Martha discovers the truth, but to save the family embarrassment, helps hide the fact. She stay on in new York in hopes of keeping an eye on Abigail, but ends up joining her.",1424390400,,770,4.347222222222222

819171,4,6304237650,"In turn-of-the-century Boston, imagine the hubbub that erupted within the stodgy social circles when news circulated about one of their own performing in a burlesque show. It exacerbates matters that Abigail Chandler's (Kathryn Grayson) uncle is as rigid as a nun's self-restraint, and a skinflint, besides. Abigail had some time ago gone to New York City to become an opera singer. But it's hard to make ends meet on a stingy uncle's allowance and so Abigail began performing on stage in the bawdy beer hall, the Golden Rooster, under the stage name of ""High C Suzie."" Word of Abigail's scandalous gig eventually traveled from the Big Apple to Beantown.

It's a fun, unassuming musical comedy. I assumed at first that TWO SISTERS FROM BOSTON, released in 1946 and shot in black and white, would focus predominantly on Kathryn Grayson, and maybe that's so in the first half hour or so. But then June Allyson strolled onto center stage. Allyson plays Abigail's younger sister Martha. But while Martha may be prim and proper and easily shocks and frequently faints, she's got gumption. That alarming rumor propels Martha and her uncle and aunt to take a trip to New York to confront Abigail. In New York, the spunky Martha sides with her sister and much of the fun in the film resides in Martha's coming up with this and that antic to help her disgraced sister. Jimmy Durante has a comic supporting role as Abigail's smooth-talking stage partner Spike. Spike goes a long way in smoothing out obstacles that stand in Abigail's rise to operatic status. This is one of Durante's better roles, and his schtick here isn't as stale as in other films.

This is the first in four pairings between June Allyson and Peter Lawford (followed by 1947's GOOD NEWS, 1949's LITTLE WOMEN, and 1972's THEY ONLY KILL THEIR MASTERS; not counted is 1943's GIRL CRAZY in which Lawford has a noncredited bit). June Allyson shines with her marvelous girl-next-door appeal. The film's highlight has to be near the end when Allyson's character goes on stage and performs as ""High C Suzie."" A side conflict surfaces when her romantic interest, Peter Lawford's wealthy but scholarly patron of the arts, comes to believe that Martha really is a ""belle of the Bowery."" It's probably not fair that Lawford gets penalized for his character being judgy like that. And not to pile on, because he's just reading a line from the script, but, earlier, he makes a comment that's meant to draw laughs but serves also as a stab at the obliviousness of the bourgeois: ""My father comes from good stock,"" proclaims Lawford. ""Why, his grandfater was the first white man to ever scalp an 1ndian.""

Kathyrn Grayson puts her operatic soprano voice to good use, but, when called on, she doesn't neglect her role as a comedienne. In a hilarious sequence, and to convince her doubting uncle and aunt that she isn't in burlesque but, rather, sings in more prestigious company, she sneaks into the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera and ends up frustrating hefty lead tenor Lauritz Melchior.",1353456000,,3035,4.855212355212355
819172,5,6304237650,I have never watched this movie before but now that I own it I really enjoyed seeing it. Even though its in black and white the picture quality is very good. Great action and acting by all the actors.,1313539200,,200,4.153846153846154
819173,1,6304237650,I was more than happy to order this movie (along with 3 others) as they have been long time favorites.  Unfortunately they negelected to let the buyer know that these movies are recorded so they will not play on a DVD/VCR Combo player.  They can be played on my PC or visit a friend and play them on a regular DVD player.,1308528000,3,321,4.161290322580645
819174,5,6304237650,"This movie is simply put, fantastic!  I found it to be delightful in every way.  Kathryn Grayson and June Allyson are two very proper sisters from high society in Boston.  One of them has been working in a burlesque show to pay for her music lessons in order to try and get into opera.  When her sister finds out about it, she is of course shocked!  But in an amazing display of sisterly love, June Allyson takes the heat at a high society dinner party and pretends to be the one in the burlesque act.  This of course leads to broken hearts from her high society friend.  However, all is happily resolved.  And we are treated to some delightful comedy in between.  A must-see!",1275177600,4,676,4.387096774193548
819175,4,6304237650,"Abigail Chandler (Kathryn Grayson) has shamed the family! She has been performing at a nightclub called ""The Golden Rooster,"" an unheard of act for a girl from such a family. A sample of her bloodline comes to investigate, and when her sister (June Allyson) learns the truth, that Abigail only did it because she was desperate for money and couldn't make it into the opera, she does what she can to help. Along with Abigail's manager (Jimmy Durante) and her sister's beau (Peter Lawford), they do their best to keep her past a secret and launch her into the career she always dreamed of.

There is plenty of humor in this movie, and that is its strength. Aside form the vibrant personality of Durante, who is always pleasant no matter what he is doing, Allyson grabs several laughs with her fainting and prudishness. There is also a cute bit about early RCA records and ""His Master's Voice."" Only die hard fans of this era will get the joke, but it is a nice nod.

I am not a big opera fan, so I did not enjoy those scenes as much as I liked the jazzy ones set in The Golden Rooster. However, Grayson has obvious talent as a singer and is really beautiful.",1243641600,,1156,4.422535211267606
