01.  The Joe Louis Story (1953)

There is seldom debate over who is the greatest fighter of all time, and this is that man's story.  With Coley Wallace (a former boxer himself) in the role of Joe Louis, this inspiring film follows the fighter's rise from poor family background to world heavyweight champion.  Over the course of 12 years, Louis would successfully defend his title a record 25 times.  But he would face equally-important challenges outside the ring, struggling to overcome racism.  Ultimately, he would help change the way black men were perceived and become America's first true black sports her

02.  The Jackie Robinson Story (1950)

Baseball legend Jackie Robinson stars as himself in this compelling biopic of the man who bravely challenged (and broke) the color barrier that existed in America's greatest pastime.  The film starts with his college athletic career and proceeds to document his rocky and abuse-ridden tenure in the minors, his relationship with supportive Brooklyn Dodgers manager Branch Rickey (Minor Watson), and his eventual big league debut, in 1947.  That season he would be named Rookie of the Year and, in subsequent seasons, go on to be named league MVP, play in several All-Star games, and lead the Dodgers to a World Championship.

03.  The Duke is Tops  (1938)

A popular small-town singer dubbed ""The Bronze Venus"" gets offered a shot at the big time in New York City, but it will mean leaving behind the loyal promoter who helped her make it this far.  This remarkable film, one of the many so-called ""race movies"" made in the 1930s and `40s for the all-black theaters in existence at the time, also marks the screen debut of a 20 year-old Lena Horne, and co-stars Ralph Cooper, longtime host of ""Amateur Night At The Apollo"".

04.  The Emperor Jones  (1933)

Eugene O'Neill's controversial play about the rise and fall of Brutus Jones, an upwardly-mobile African-American whose life careens from railroad porter to convict to a corrupt island ruler in Haiti, made for an even more daring film adaptation in 1933.  Actor Paul Robeson (who also played Jones on stage) delivers a career performance that features several musical numbers and climaxes with a 25-minute monologue delivered as his life unravels before him.  In 1999, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry after the Library of Congress deemed it ""culturally significant"" for its portrayal of black characters.",1265760000,7,2486,5.0244498777506115

8390657,3,B0037QGUTO,"Though I enjoyed the one film that was there, I gave a three star rating because I thought there were four films. The description did not make it clear there was only one film and certainly not which film I was renting. I have seen Emperor Jones and would have liked to have seen the others. Better description needed for a more informed rental!",1478736000,2,345,4.40625

8390665,5,B0037QGUTO,"In all fairness, African-American films ought NOT be judged by the yardstick of Hollywood made films which gave marginal roles to African-Americans such as servant roles, buffoons and over-bearing black women, while black films also showed black people as cooks, doctors, judges, nurses, police, etc., even as criminal masterminds and well organized gangs if it was a crime-drama film. It was bad enough that if a theater allowed black people to see the films there, they were sent upstairs to the balcony. Pioneers like Noble Mark Johnson introduced The Lincoln Movie Company and you had Oscar Devereaux Micheaux and Spencer William Jr., the latter helped pioneer sound in movies. Budgets were very low and producer/directors like Noble M. Johnson took the money they made playing roles in white motion pictures and paid it all into black made films that lacked quality, yes, lacked good sound, true, but they made up for it by valiant effort to reach black audiences. By the way, Hollywood ""B"" movies were not the best either as they had limited budgets as well! Here you get Jackie Robinson, Joe Lewis, Lena Horne and Paul Robeson too, what a bargain! Look at the heart and soul infused in these films instead of looking for perfection in lighting, sound, etc. Fewer than 100 black films survive with the 400 plus missing, especially from the silent era! Thank God for HISTORIC BLACK CINEMA and Amazon.com, what a bargain!",1427500800,5,1425,4.96652719665272
