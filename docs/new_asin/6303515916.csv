""Big Ears"" from 1931 is the first short. In it, Wheezer hears his parents fighting and deciding to divorce. He has no idea what the word means, but when the neighbor children tell him, he starts crying and becomes determined to stop it. How? By making himself sick of course! His parents are always hugging and kissing when he's sick! Stymie helps Wheezer by preparing ""ain't ice cream"" also known as lard, a combination of various condiments, and soap. Before long, Wheezer is exclaiming ""Ow!"" in pain and begging for Dorothy and Stymie to find the medicine from the cabinet. Although not a short to show small children who copy everything they see on tv, this sequence is rather funny to adults. In the end, Wheezer's parents promise to love each other always, but Pete obviously believes differently.

""A Lad an' a Lamp"" from 1932 is an excellent take on the popularity of Aladdin. In it, the gang is surrounded by various lamps, rubbing them and hoping for a genie to appear and grant them wishes. Finally, a vaudeville magician hears them and plays into their fantasies. The short is a fast paced, fun film which ends up with the gang thinking the genie has turned Stymie's brother Cotton into a monkey by Spanky's request.

""Anniversary Trouble"" from 1935 features Academy Award winner Hattie McDaniel as Spanky's maid and Buckwheat's mother. The short features the famous ""high sign."" The gang has formed a club and appointed Spanky treasurer. He behaves rather strangely because of the secrecy of the gang, but his parents think he has stolen a misplaced cash envelope given as an anniversary present to his mother from his father. The short is filled with cute scenes including one where Spanky dresses as Buckwheat to escape the watchful eye of the gang and one where Buckwheat chants gibberish (""I command?"") while pushing a stroller.

""Little Sinner"" is the final short on this tape. The short was made in 1935 and stars Spanky, Porky (in his first film), and Buckwheat. The kids decide to skip church to go fishing instead. However, there is a church nearby saving people who leap into the wood yelling, ""Hallelujah!"" The boys end up becoming scared, and rush off to church saying they'll never skip again. It has its funny moments, but overall it the weakest short on the tape.",1129680000,5,2359,4.817283950617284
