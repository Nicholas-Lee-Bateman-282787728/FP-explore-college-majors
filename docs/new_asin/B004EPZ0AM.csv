4352326,1,B004EPZ0AM,"In my family we LOVE Mumble. We have watched Happy Feet more than 50 times. The movie has a strong environmental message but is positive and loving and very funny. You really care for the penguins and hope everything will end well and laugh all through the movie with Ramon and the ""Amigos"". It makes you go out and love the world we live in, and want to take care of it.

Happy Feet 2 is another issue. I spent the whole movie wishing it would end soon. I got this terrible feeling that the world is going to end tomorrow. I understand how important it is for kids to be conscious about what is going on in the world. After all, they are our future and need to take care of our planet. But seeing the ice melting in such a terrifying way, seeing grass growing everywhere around their friends Mumble and Gloria, seeing thousands of penguins about to die... was not something my kids needed to see.

My oldest (6) was very stressed during the movie, telling me he didn't want to see the ice melting and asking continuously if the movie would end well.

Not at all funny and with much less dancing and singing than the first one, this is actually a thriller kids don't need to watch.

We didn't even enjoy the singing since Gloria's voice is nothing like it used to be and Eric's singing is so tremendously squeaky.

Where are their parents, anyway? Did they just disappear?

Could have done without it, would have felt much happier all evening.",1323043200,23,1443,4.406015037593985

Happy Feet Two, a sequel to the 2006 film Happy Feet, is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand it is, like the original, a masterful feat of CGI animation in the way it portrays in stunning detail both the animal characters and the stark beauty of the Antarctic and aquatic environments they live in.  But on the other hand, unlike the original, the story is a near-incoherent mess of multiple meandering plot threads and, quite frankly, too many characters.  Given that it was directed by George Miller and written by Miller, Gary Eck, Warren Coleman and Paul Livingston, most of whom were involved in the directing and writing of the first film, it is something of a puzzle as to why the story-telling side of things fell so far short this time around.

The plot:  Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria (voiced this time around by Pink) now have a young son named Erik (Ava Acres) who's reluctant to dance and who, when encouraged to try by Mumble, ends up falling flat on his face in front of the whole Emperor penguin community and is humiliated. Erik then runs away - along with his two best friends Boadicia (Meibh Campbell) and Atticus (Lil P-Nut) - with Ramon (Robin Williams) who has decided to return to his original home of Adele-land.  When they reach Adele-land, they find that much has changed.  The Adele penguin community is now under the god-like leadership of a strange-looking penguin (actually a puffin pretending to be a penguin) named The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria) who can fly!  Lovelace (Robin Williams again) who met Sven when both were rescued by a Russian trawler, acts as his prophet, proclaiming to all and sundry the miraculous history and powers of The Mighty Sven and the philosophy of Sven-Think (""If you want it, you must will it. If you will it, it will be yours."")

From here on, the plot threads and characters involved only multiply and grow more inter-tangled. Mumble goes to Adele-land to bring back Erik and his friends, only to find Erik doesn't want to leave his hero, The Mighty Sven.  Ramon pursues a female penguin named Carmen (Sofia Vergara) who wants nothing to do with him, but Sven convinces Ramon to believe in himself and his destiny. The scene then abruptly switches to underwater where we meet two kirll - Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) and Bill the Krill (Matt Damon), who are part of a huge swarm of millions of krill but who decide to leave because Will believes there is cosmic  meaning to be found beyond the swarm.  Back on the surface, a sudden splitting of glacial ice disrupts Emperor-land and traps the Emperor penguin community in a high-walled canyon of ice, cutting them off from the ocean and hence from their food supply.  Erik and his friends begin their return with Mumble to Emperor-land, but only because Sven urged him to.  Along the way, they encounter an aggressive bull elephant seal, Bryan the Beach Master (Richard Carter), and his two pups, who refuses to back up to let them pass across a narrow ice bridge, but events lead to Mumble rescuing Bryan and Bryan swearing that he owes Mumble a favor.  When they finally reach Emperor-land, they find that they cannot reach the now-trapped Emperor penguin community.  As Mumble and Erik try to find a way to save the trapped penguins from starvation, the scenes go back and forth between Emperor penguins, Adele penguins, Mumble, Erik, Ramon, Lovelace, Sven, Will and Bill, Bryan and the seal herd, with some humans and a flock of menacing skua (basically sea vultures) added into the mix for good measure.  Sound jumbled and thrown together?  It is.

As is the singing and dancing.  The original Happy Feet had singing and dancing, but there was a seamless continuity to it all and everything flowed.  Here, it feels like they threw in everything but the kitchen sink (and they even do that at one point when Erik launches into an operatic aria about his father) with the result that there's no flow and no unifying theme. Instead, the film feels like it's constantly veering off into new directions, none of which is ever followed up on.  If there is a unifying theme - other than the obvious environmental one and the usual heavy-handed messages of 'Be Yourself!"" and ""Everyone needs to work together!"" - it's insecurity.  Erik's insecurity about fitting into the community.  Mumble's insecurity about being a father.  Ramon's insecurity about finding a mate.  Sven's insecurity about not being accepted if the others find out he's not a penguin.  Will's insecurity at finding out krill are at the bottom of the food chain, and Bill's insecurity about not being part of a swarm.  And Bryan's insecurity of what will happen to him if the other seals find out he backed up for a penguin.  Which pretty much sums up the core problem with Happy Feet Two - it's an insecure movie that isn't sure just what it wants to be.

To be fair, I fear that I'm making the film sound worse than it actually is, which is not my intention.  Happy Feet Two is not a bad film at all.  In point of fact, the individual pieces of it are all quite good.  I particularly liked the scenes with Will and Bill, which in addition to being stunningly animated were also pretty funny and the most likely to appeal to adult viewers, especially ones who enjoy delightfully painful puns like the one in the exchange where Will cries ""I want to be free!"" and Bill replies ""There's no such thing as free, Will.""  But put them all together and what you end up with is a jumble, a case where the whole is actually less than the sum of the parts.  Much as I liked the Will and Bill scenes, you could in fact have cut all of them out and it wouldn't have affected the main story line at all.

I would still recommend Happy Feet Two.  Children will probably not have too much of a problem with the meandering plot threads, though they may make the film too long for smaller children.  And as I said, the CGI animation is extremely well done.  I just wish that they had thought a bit more on the screenplay before making the movie.  This is definitely a case where less would have been more.",1322956800,5,6167,4.6192660550458715
4352328,1,B004EPZ0AM,"This movie is not that funny as expected, esp. not for children. In addition, there is too much drama esp. for a movie like that. Sometimes it was boring and i was happy as the movie was over.",1322956800,12,192,4.078947368421052
4352329,4,B004EPZ0AM,"sitting here, ordering vast amounts of usless junk for beloved people on my lists and reading about happy feet 2 and wondering what kind of a shallow life must one lead in order to PAN a cartoon movie?  Just a thought of my moment.",1322179200,3,231,4.25
4352330,2,B004EPZ0AM,"""Happy Feet 2"" or the sequel to the animated musical for kids is absolutely beautiful. From the intricate fibers of hairs to the glowing jellyfish and the delicate wrinkles of nature escalating into giant land moving earthquakes, everything is like an i-max penguin nature film. ""Happy Feet"" was a surprise hit in 2006, and honestly, I was very surprised. A movie about a little penguin named Mumble, voiced by Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), who likes to dance and is treated as an outcast because he can't stop tapping his feet, was a hit at the box office. His fellow penguins love to sing though, they just hadn't keened into the dancing thing.

In the sequel, Mumbles is the father, and the penguins of the emperor penguin community are now keen on the dancing, along with the singing. Mumbles son Erik, voiced by Ava Acres, sort of runs along the same course as Mumbles did in the first movie. Embarrassed by an incident on his first attempt to dance, he runs away with two of his friends to find himself. Erik's dilemma isn't dancing, but flying. He wants to fly and he's given false hope by a bird posing as a penguin named Sven.

The movie may start out on a similar course as the original, but it eventually turns into something completely different, in many ways. ""Happy Feet 2"" is less comedy and musical and more drama. Sure, there's singing and dancing, but nowhere near as much as the first movie. That being said, the finale's catchy rendition of Queen's ""Under Pressure"" was the best part of the film. Much of the middle of the film is bogged down with dramatic moments and slow moving scenes. As silly as I think dancing, rapping penguins can be and are, the middle of the movie could have used more choreographed penguins breaking and shaking like they were Usher or Michael Jackson.

Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Pink also lend their voice talents to ""Happy Feet 2"", a movie that has its moments, including the finale, but for the most part it's slow moving and less interesting than most animated movies these days. The animated movie genre sort of shot through the roof over the past few years with movies like, ""Up"", ""Toy Story 3"", ""Coraline"", ""Tangled"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Megamind"". ""Happy Feet 2"" doesn't measure up.",1321747200,15,2258,4.668341708542713
4352331,3,B004EPZ0AM,"-Warning: this review is laden with spoilers-

Somewhere around the 30 minute mark of Happy Feet Two, there's a scene where Gloria, played by Alecia ""Pink"" Moore in lieu of the late Brittany Murphy, sings to her scared baby penguin named Erik a song called ""Bridge of Light"", while he appears trapped on an upper glacier. The lyrics seem to be a hippie anthem about how all you need is love, and how if the world had everyone love each other, and... Well, that, the world wouldn't be a so bad place, like, ya know? At that point, their peace and love causes the northern lights to start. This is where the first thing that popped up in my mind was ""people who thought the first movie was too preachy should best steer clear of THIS.""

It only seemed possible from the success of the first movie that a sequel would be released. I mean, after all, despite the fact that it left audiences divided, it became popular and made tons of bucks at the box office. And since Brittany Murphy died, things further went to hell for this sequel. Despite all that... It managed to get made and released... And not much else.

I'll admit I loved the first movie. I can understand why it would divide audiences- not everyone favours a global warming message, but I liked it, it had great music, it was super cute, and I absolutely loved it. I was in favour of the inevitable sequel that followed. Tonight I finally saw the sequel... And, it was a mess.

If anything, the best way to describe this movie would be rushed. I still find it hard to believe that this movie took 5 years to make... This kind of ""plot"" could have been scraped up in a week, not even, for me. I feel as if they probably felt rushed to find a Brittany Murphy replacement and go from there, to rush the film out.

However, there is a fair amount to love in this film. Obviously, I did give the movie a 5/10, so there's a lot to love, right? For one, the charming look is still here. The look has vastly improved from the first movie evidently. The animation looks far better, and the IMAX 3D complimented the graphics perfectly. Every single flake of snow, hair, drop of water can be seen, it's absolutely amazing. In addition, the voice work is admirable too- Matt Damon and Brad Pitt as the skrill, Robin Williams as Lovelace, Hank Azaria as Sven (probably the highlight of the film), Elijah Wood as Mumble, etc.

There are a lot of funny moments in the film too, I won't lie. I loved the brief shout outs to the first movie, as well as the ""Loney Goatherd"" yodel to scare the birds away. I will also admit, I LOVED Under Pressure, it was AMAZING. and how it was in tune to the snow falling, was even greater.

However, unfortunately it isn't enough to make up for... Um... The rest of this movie.

No memorable numbers except for Under Pressure. The first movie had Boogie Wonderland and Somebody to Love. Those were awesome! And all the worse is that it starts off so well with the medley. It makes you believe the film will be just as good as the first. Too bad the film scraps that promise right away.

What was the plot?! The movie can't even decide what it was about, which is even bad in the first 40 minutes. At first you think it's going to be a story along the same lines of the first movie, about a youngling in search of his inner dance. Then all of a sudden... It's about global warming... Oh, wait, we must introduce Sven, the flying penguin! Oh, now were trapped in their home land! And the skrill! Who were they and why were they in the movie?! They had no point at all!!!

...which marks the perfect point to segue into the film's biggest issue: the movie moves at such a glacial pace (no pun intended), since 3/4 of the film are set in the homeland. This made the movie feel longer than it was, for reasons I cannot put my finger on. I mean, global warming is an issue that is important to be touched upon. However, the film just stays there, and it doesn't work. It ruins what could been a great film.

In short, I wish I could love this movie. But... There's too much of too little. Whereas the first movie was a marvel in terms of everything, this film is cute and... cute. I love cute things. I need more than just cute, though. I need enjoyability to go with it. And while this film isn't bad at all, I can't recommend it, for reasons stated above.

OVERALL: 5/10

THE GOOD: Gorgeously rendered and animated, Happy Feet Two stays cute and delivers on the dancing and cuteness.

THE BAD: Cuteness can't make up for its indecisive screenplay, lack of memorable numbers and characters void of emotional connectability.",1321660800,3,4597,4.380281690140845
4352332,1,B004EPZ0AM,"I was fortunate enough to see a free advanced screening of Happy Feet 2 (Two) this weekend. Unfortunately, this is probably the worst children's movie sequel made to date. Unlike the first Happy Feet, Happy Feet Two does not have a story or message; nor does it have much to do with the first Happy Feet (other than most of the original characters/ voice actors).

This movie is simply just a weak excuse to sell tickets (during the Thanksgiving weekend/ holiday-- what a coincidence) of the 'newest 3-D movie', AND because it's a name (Happy Feet) that many people/ children recognize! Do yourself a BIG favor, don't be a victim of this bad movie.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: HAPPY FEET TWO 3D [2011] is an Australian-American 3D computer-animated family musical film directed by George Miller and returns audiences to the magnificent and epic landscape of Antarctica. HAPPY FEET TWO 3D is a sequel to George Miller's film HAPPY FEET [2006] and features Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hugo Weaving, Magda Szubanski and Anthony LaPaglia reprising their roles from the first film. P!nk and Richard Carter replaced the deceased Brittany Murphy and Steve Irwin as Gloria and Trev, respectively. HAPPY FEET TWO 3D is dedicated to the memory of Brittany Murphy and Steve Irwin. Also Common was also replaced Fat Joe as Seymour. The original cast is joined by new characters voiced by Hank Azaria, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Sof&iacute;a Vergara.

HAPPY FEET TWO 3D is easily one of the most enjoyable, energetic and sometimes chaotic experiences out there, packed with classic songs, fun characters, great 3D visuals and a few nifty surprises. It's the sort of experience that's worth checking out more than once, and it gets better with each viewing. HAPPY FEET TWO 3D film is several films crammed into one, mixed with numerous songs, plenty of fun characters, a few genuinely awesome 3D visuals, and outstanding computer animation, not to mention a couple of cute surprises. It also happens to be one of the most intriguing, ambitious, and often original sequels out there. While some will not enjoy the film's chaotic spirit, you can't fault a sequel for daring to be not just different, but better.

This time around, the sequel follows Erik [Ava Acres], the son of Mumble [Elijah Wood], our hero from the last tale. Erik is scared of all the singing and dancing that his Emperor penguin clan engages in, and ends up leaving them in search of greener pastures and Mumble then leaves the clan to track him down. This leads both of them to another colony lead by Sven [Hank Azaria], a so called penguin who has adopted the ability to fly, but later reveals who he really is. From there on things go from traditional, to completely non-traditional. And the narrative spirals in many different directions, not unlike the ice and watery environment painted in the film.

When Erik and Mumble return to their clan, they find that a gigantic iceberg has trapped their families inside the canyon. From there on they attempt to free their loved ones before hunger seals their fate. Along the way, and woven throughout the story, is the somewhat existential adventure of two krill named Bill [Matt Damon] and Will [Brad Pitt] who both give tremendous performances, who leave their mundane existence in search of something daring, fresh and new.

Chaos is sort of the best way to describe this film, but what Australian director George Miller seems to be doing is creating multiple of story threads, dozens of characters, and a few twists and turns on the way, so making HAPPY FEET TWO 3D feel like a four or five animated films ideas tightly woven together into one and does quite a good job overall and if anything, it makes for a much more rewarding experience when watching it in its full and glorious 3D animation.

But HAPPY FEET TWO 3D is about as bizarre as they come, a lively product that captures the heart and spirit of cult Australian filmmaking. The narrative, while borrowing some cues from the first animated film HAPPY FEET, does not flow like a traditional 3D animated film, and the story scenario is sometimes more mature than some younger audiences will be able to handle or understand, and to my mind that is not a bad thing, as why should children always be catered for over adults foremost needs in enjoying a 3D animated film of this calibre.

The somewhat negative reaction HAPPY FEET TWO 3D endured during its original cinema release was likely the result of shock over how much this film has to say, and how sometimes sprawling the narrative appears. But cut underneath the surface, and there is a simple, and rather lovely poetic message this 3D animated film is trying to convey, and it's a profound one well worth experiencing and especially as it is still has a wonderful rollercoaster ride filled with magic, love, music and tons of hilarious fun. The 3D animated film dares to be better, as well as different, and it always tries its best to make you smile. And seriously, how much more can you ask from a penguin and especially the team behind this 3D animated lovely family oriented film?

Common and Lil P-Nut show us how much fun it was, down under, to voice their animated characters! This brief look shows the obvious fun all the cast had in the studio, where they recorded their lines as a group instead of individually.

Special Feature: I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat [Looney Tunes Short] [2011] [1080p] [2.40:1] [4:00] Here we have a New Looney Tune Computer-Animated Short. It features the voice of June Foray as Granny, and Mel Blanc's archive recordings taken from the song for Sylvester and Tweety pie. The short is an adaptation of the 1950 song of the same name, sung by Mel Blanc. The animated short is presented with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround audio track as a bonus. In 1950, Mel Blanc recorded some novelty songs for Capitol Records in the voices of his characters he did for Warner Bros. Cartoons. Now someone has taken his voices from one of those records and, with a new arrangement based on the originals by Billy May, has put them in this new computer animated short in order to illustrate the characterizations of Tweety Pie and Sylvester in all their violent glory!

Special Feature: P!nk's New Song [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:56] Spend time with P!nk and the new song that has been recorded especially for the animated film, which is entitled Bridge of Light and was  released on the 2nd December, 2011 by Sony Music. We also get to see some behind-the-scene with P!nk in the recording studio. You also get some scenes from the animated film where the song is sung. The song was written by P!nk and her long-time collaborator Billy Mann and serves as the theme song to the film HAPPY FEET TWO 3D [2011]. The song was a moderate success and became a top 10 hit in Austria, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland, but failed to chart high in other countries due to minimal promotion.

Special Feature: Happy Feet 2 Sing-A-Long: Here you have a selection of three Sing-A-Long music videos and they are as follows:

01. The Mighty Sven Sing-A-Long [2011] [1080p] [2.40:1] [4:15] Why not join in and Sing-A-Long with some of your favourite songs from the animated film and especially with penguin Lovelace [Robin Williams] and to help you, you get the wording at the bottom of the screen, so enjoy!

02. Bridge of Light Sing-A-Long [2011] [1080p] [2.40:1] [3:25] Once again you are invited to Sing-A-Long with one of your favourite song from the animated film. But this time you get the full music video from P!nk of the song that again appeared in the animated film and again you get the wording appearing at the bottom of the screen.

03. Papa Oom Mow Mow Sing-A-Long [2011] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1:14] Here we get to view the final Sing-A-Long music video. Once again you get the wording appearing at the bottom of the screen to help you join in singing along with the animated characters in the animated film. Sadly, for some unknown reason the Sing-A-Long video ends abruptly.

Special Feature: BD-LIVE: This feature requires access to a broadband Internet connection. If your Blu-ray player is currently set to prohibit connections to the Internet, then please consult your Blu-ray player manual or a Blu-ray support website.

Finally, HAPPY FEET TWO 3D [3D Blu-ray] might pack a lot into a small package, but it's a joyful experience that will bound to impress many adults and children alike. If nothing else, expect this one to earn cult status in the years to come, especially among lovers of Australian cinema. Director George Miller has also mastered the art of the elaborately choreographed animated musical number: The sequel features even more show-stopper performances usually led by P!nk, that is very original, and each of which was planned by a team of famous choreographers, including tap dancer Savion Glover, who was responsible for all of Mumble's moves thanks to motion-capture technology. Overall, the musical numbers and the 3D animation are totally fantastic, but the actual story isn't as cohesive as the original's coming-of-age tale. So I definitely recommend you see this one even if you missed the first HAPPY FEET animated film. It's original enough to feel like a stand-alone 3D animated film for sure. Highly Recommended!

4352848,3,B004EPZ0AM,"The DVD advertised was to be in standard format, which I interpreted as being full-screen. What came was a widescreen version, but with the same cover of close-up of Eric the child penguin. As in the first Happy Feet, there is too much singing, not enough plot. I can say the film was visually very impressive, with hyper-realistic CGI rendering. I won't bother summarizing the plot as others have already done that, I'll only say it is a climate change promotional piece with a very thin story. One of the themes is teaching children to believe in themselves and find what they are good. In the case of Eric it seems to be singing opera. Actually I lied the character of Sven the best. He is the flying puffin who pretends to be a penguin. The humans have very role in the film, done with motion capture that I thought was live action, but wasn't. Here they are fisherman and are perceived by one penguin as eaters of penguins (though they were eating chickens). I would have liked to have seen more of Carmen (Sofia Vergara) in the film and more of the characters Robin Williams voiced. The feature film was yet another plot device to get everyone to cooperate in order to solve a problem. Somehow I just thought the story was to thin.
  The DVD has several extras, a documentary on Antarctica's wildlife and the threat of climate change. It also seems to be an advertisement for the World Wildlife Federation. Also has a short on How to Draw a Penguin as done by an artist. And, there is a strange CGI Looney Tunes short, I Tawt I Saw a Puddy Tat"" with a vocal track by Mel Blanc recorded in 1950. Some probably liked it, but the visuals looked grotesque to me. Some times CGI just doesn't work.",1479600000,,1698,4.456591639871383

4354073,3,B004EPZ0AM,"THE FILM: The story this time around is a little more unfocused, with some superfluous characters, but the animation is just as impressive and voice cast is expanded in this sequel to the Academy Award-winning HAPPY FEET. In HAPPY FEET TWO, Mumble and Gloria have a son Erik who is having difficulty finding his place in the community. Will he sing? Will he dance? He doesn't know. Meanwhile, shifting Arctic ice traps the majority of the Emperor penguin colony and Mumble goes to off to find help. What I noticed as different this time was that there wasn't as much singing/dancing. This was an element that really enriched the first one and made me enjoy it a little more. The story in this sequel had less of that, and at times was a little dull and borderline depressing. Still, there is a happy ending because, you know, it's a kid's movie. Also, while it was nice to have a larger cast full of recognizable voices, a couple of the characters they play were largely unnecessary and distracting to the overall story-line. The two biggest offenders, despite how entertaining they were to watch, were Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as two krill. Why were they in the movie? Who knows? They never interacted with the main story in any meaningful way, and just seemed like an excuse to get a couple more big-name actors on the marquee. A little more understandable in terms of the themes is the inclusion of a puffin named Sven, who can fly. His primary function is to provide inspiration and guidance to Erik although, as penguins (and the audience) already know, they can't fly even if they wanted to. Despite the character being somewhat unneeded, Hank Azaria did a great job voicing him. The rest of the voice cast, some of which were replacements (Common for Fat Joe, and P!nk for Brittany Murphy), also did a good job, but P!nk was probably the least compelling of them all. She's a decent singer, but her acting could definitely use some work. Overall, the film was slightly less entertaining than its predecessor, but nonetheless enjoyable in its own right.

THE DISC: The animation was just as stunning this time around as in the first film, and it looks great on Blu-ray. Also, as with the first, there is a seamless blending of computer animation and actual people (in a couple scenes). Bottom line: this movie would make a great reference for a large HDTV. There's also some special features to enjoy after the film, although a little less this time than with the first one. The first featurette is a 12-minute educational film on Antarctica, its animal inhabitants and climate change, with the child actor who voiced Atticus. While interesting and informative, this short documentary is clearly aimed at children (like the film). Next up is a 5-minute featurette with the storyboard artist on how to draw a penguin. While you might think it teaches someone how to draw a penguin, it actually shows how the artist created Erik on the computer. Cool, but not what I expected. As on the previous movie, they include a Warner Brothers cartoon, but this time it's a computer animated Looney Tunes short instead of a classic, hand-drawn one. While it features a lot of the humor and gags one would expect from Looney Tunes, the computer animation didn't exactly feel right to me. Rounding out the extra material are three sing-alongs which should be fun for the kiddies.

OVERALL: This sequel isn't as good as the first one, but the visuals are eye-popping and the musical numbers are just as entertaining. The extras are also decent, so it makes sense to purchase this if you enjoyed the first HAPPY FEET.",1411084800,,3607,4.732909379968204

4354427,5,B004EPZ0AM,"After reading all the negative review, I was compelled to write my own.  This movie is great! My 21 month daughter is obsessed with Happy Feet 2. She constantly wants to watch ""Happy"".  We can't even say the word, ""happy"" in our household without triggering ""happy? happy?..."" from her. Which means that she wants to watch ""Happy"". We try to limit her TV viewing to only a small amount a day, so we queue it for her to watch the last 31 minutes of the movie (in our opinion, the best part) once during the day and before bed time.

With that said, we also have Happy Feet 1, however have not had a chance to get too far into the movie so I can't compare it to 2 as of yet. All I can say is, ""Erik's Opera"" song is the most adorable and touching song in the movie and has my daughter enraptured, while "" Under Pressure"" gets my daughter up on her feet swaying and doing the toddler dance. She loves 2 so much I am in the process of purchasing the movie sound track as well.",1402272000,,972,4.105263157894737

4355391,5,B004EPZ0AM,"I found this picture pretty straightforward. Mumble is grown and has a young one named Eric,an immensely shy little penguin, who like his father, has trouble expressing himself. Despite his parents encouragement,his one attempt causes an embarrassing moment. When Ramon tries to lend support, he is blown off and on his way back to Adelieland finds he has company when Erik follows allow with two friends. Mumble follows and proceeds to try to get the young ones to return. It is here that Erik meets Sven, a charismatic Puffin from the far North, who met Lovelace aboard a ship and believes him to be a penguin who can fly and who teaches Erik that whatever he wills is his. At that moment,an earthquake shakes the area, pushing a huge iceberg ahead of itself and when the penguins get back to Emperorland,they discover the iceberg has blocked the group inside a deep bowl with no way out. Mumble then tries to enlist what help he can as he strives to help however he can. Lovelace tries to attract the help of the aliens and they do come, but can't stay because a storm drives them away. The Adelies do their best to help by fishing until the storm freezes the ice. It is by dancing that Mumble has figured a way to free the Emperors when he and the Adelies shake the snow against the berg, but it isn't enough and he must enlist the aid of the Elephant Seals and Erik discovers he can sing and does so to persuade the stubborn seals to help. Together, they manage to break the ice to free the Emperors. Bill and Will Krill in the meantime,in their journey of self discovery and to lead the swarm to safer waters also help inadvertantly to break the berg because they believe the dancing means something. The movie does have its drawbacks, the Krills seem a bit disjointed and it flows a bit unevenly, but beyond that, it was a fairly straight story with great music and good characters. One I would recommend.",1365724800,2,1912,4.512968299711815

4355394,3,B004EPZ0AM,"I've got to admit, the first Happy Feet took me by surprise.  Penguins- been there done that.  Musicals- been there, don't need to do that again.  Environmentalism agendas - am there, hate that!  Yet still the film left me surprised for its ability to tell a moving, charming tale of the interaction between humanity and nature.  The characters were easy to care about; the tension was real and the pacing was flawless.  Naturally when I heard a sequel had been made in 2011 that featured a majority of the same vocal talent (with some powerhouse additions), had $130-million budged (up $30-mil over the first one) and was again written & directed by George Miller, I was naturally interested in continuing with the tale.

I suppose I should start with the good news: This isn't a copy/paste rehash of the first film.  The bad news: This isn't a copy/paste rehash of the first film.  While it's true this one probably looked decent on paper (swooping panoramic shots of masses of dancing penguins, near photo-realistic textures and animal models, a new secondary story thread following a pair of existentially obsessed krill and so on), the problem this time around has everything to do with pacing and plot structure but more on that in a bit.

The film comes in at a runtime of 100-minutes and wears a PG rating for some animated hijinks, little tension and mild rude humor.  The cast is pretty tight again (though slightly different this time around): Elijah Wood returns as Mumble, P!nk replaces the late Brittany Murphy as Gloria, Robin Williams is back pulling double duty as Ramon/ Lovelace, and Hugo Weaving returns as the village elder.  Mumble's parents (Memphis played by Hugh Jackman and Norma Jean/ Nicole Kidman) are nowhere to be found this time but Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were brought on board as Will and Bill the Krill respectively.

The story, or what passes for one here, opens with our main couple having birthed a young penguin named Erik, who, like his father before him, doesn't seem to have the natural gift for singing.  Unlike his pops, however, Erik lacks to rhythm to tap dance his way into hero-status.  Faced with childhood humiliation and parental crises of a confidence-less kid, the story begins to look a little predictable.

However things quickly take a turn for the bizarre when little Erik and his pals venture off to the neighboring community of Adelie penguins where they encounter The Mighty Sven, a Tufted Puffin (bird) apparently mistaken as a flying penguin by the Adelies.  Dispensing generic advice by the boatload through a bit of an over-the-top accent by Hank Azaria, Sven becomes Erik's new role model (not to mention convinces many a penguin that the ability to fly is simply a matter of believing in themselves).  Amidst all this we follow two krill who leave the safety and security of the only swarm they've ever known to discover the vast world beyond.

Long story short- Erik discovers that even though he can't dance or fly, he can achieve greatness by believing in himself right? Wrong!  The real core of the story here works off the premise that a massive iceberg crashes into the ice floe home of the emperor penguins, trapping the lot of them in a valley.  This time the story is a rescue operation rather than a tale of character growth; and there's nothing wrong with that when done correctly.

The trouble here is the pacing is pretty messy.  Disasters just keep unfolding out of nowhere only to be overcome just in time for the next one.  Never is there a sense of a strong backstory or valuable lesson present so much as a successive collection of sweeping scenes.  The singing/ dancing element is certainly more stale (and overused) this time around as well.

The environmentalist cues oft-complained about in the first film are back, though admittedly not quite so ""in your face"" as say Lovelace with a 6-pack holder cutting off his oxygen, prepare for a fair share of global warming references, segments of oil spills and even some odd live-footage splices of turkeys being stuffed and chickens rotating on a rotisserie.  However, and to the film's credit, they do try to redeem mankind by depicting us as trying to help build a way out for the stranded penguins as well as cleaning up the oil-soaked animals.

In all, Happy Feet Two meanders around and pokes at some pretty interesting concepts but never really flushes any of them out by the film's conclusion.  Perhaps its biggest crime however happens to be that it never establishes the type of connection that makes you really concerned for the characters.  Watchable for sure, and kids will likely be entertained by the beautiful visuals and dancing, but it's the nuances adults will notice that keep it from filling the happy shoes of the original.",1365033600,,4778,4.812729498164015

4355454,5,B004EPZ0AM,"Okay, I love this movie. I loved the first one, but the second is better. SPOILER ALERT: It has more songs than the first, and I don't feel like strangling the penguin head elder, or whatever he is, like I did in the first one, because in this one he's nice. The first one was kind of frustrating, because the others gave Mumble such a hard time. This one is about Mumble's family, Gloria, and their son, Erik. What happened to the parents, I don't know.  Of course, Lovelace is back, so is Ramone and his friends, along with some new characters, the elephant seal and beachmaster, Brian, Ramone's love interest, Carmen, 2 hilarious krills, and another bird masquarading as a penguin, Sven. The ending is, of course, happy, with the penguins being freed from their ice prison, that was caused by the ice caps melting, and making the ice shift. (I hope that made sense-it's kind of hard to explain). The cast is cool, with Elijah Wood back as Mumble, Pink as Gloria, and Robin Williams as Lovelace and Ramone.  But here's my question, and I hope someone can answer it.  On the internet, it says that John Goodman is the voice of the beachmaster, but then it says someone else is, too. And the video doesn't even have him listed. So, is he in it, or not? And if so, who's voice does he do? Anybody know?",1364601600,,1301,4.435146443514644

We've passed Happy Feet 2 over several times even though the family enjoyed the first one very much. We did this simply because we were looking at the star ratings at a glance and didn't want to spend hard earned money on a movie that was apparently sub-par as many times sequels can be. How wrong this assumption was! We fully agree with the other raters of 4 and 5 stars! This movie was very enjoyable and entertaining both in content meaning and through the musical themes. For those of you that are hesitant because of the ratings of 1 star, disregard them. This movie is very enjoyable and has meaning along with entertainment value for the whole family. Perhaps a few feel that the movie theme is repetitive, and in some aspects, perhaps it is. But it is a sequel after all, that by nature will follow certain themes. However, if you give it a chance, you and your family will likely also find it is underrated by those person(s) that for whatever reason have negatively targeted this movie.

This is the worst movie ever!"", I couldn't agree more and I shut it off. I should have rented it instead if buying the 3D version. I thought it would be good because I assumed that the allegedly false negative reviews on this message board were throwing off the stars given to this film.

I'm sorry, but it really isn't worth buying and I don't see the appeal. The songs were mediocre and the plot wasn't as ""stimulating"" as people are describing it to be.

4356367,4,B004EPZ0AM,"""Happy Feet"" is one of my all-time favorite films for its beautiful animation, wonderful music, and powerful environmental message. There was nothing more that needed to be added to the tale of Mumble Happyfeet, the dancing penguin. So, you can imagine my dismay when I heard that there was a sequel in the works. I've ranted and debated about this sequel in various blogs all over the place, and I can safely say that I both like this film and have issues with it.

Good Aspects of this Movie:
1. All your favorite characters are back, even if it's only for brief cameos.
2. The animation is even better than the first!
3. You will fall in love with the characters of Sven and Erik.
4. The musical numbers play with some new territory with a great original song and even opera.
5. Less environmental ""preachyness,"" as some of you called the first one.

Bad Aspects of this Movie:
1. Too many pointless subplots that distract from the main story (the krill and Carmen are primary examples).
2. Soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first film's.
3. A waste of Sofia Vergara. She only has seven lines!

Main point: If you've seen the first movie and really like it, check this sequel out. It's not as bad as a lot of people say it is here, but it's not as good as the first one. If you haven't seen the first film or just know it's not really your cup of tea, just stay away.

Also, the bonus features even on the bluray are bad. There's virtually nothing interesting to do. This is the same qualm I had with the first film's features though, so go figure.",1338076800,4,1554,4.40418118466899

4356373,5,B004EPZ0AM,"Mr. Miller is one of my favorite directors but I was a little hesitant about watching this movie after seeing such a low rating for this. Then I read the reviews and realized that there was something fishy about the bad reviews. After watching the movie twice (in one day) I think I can guess which gang wrote those bad reviews. I will reveal that at the end. (SPOILER warning towards the end.)

I will not cover the story line but will say that the cast is full of lively characters, all with different accents and different musical tastes, and never putting down any one. This movie is a celebration of diversity. There was even one line by a penguin in an Indian accent and it was delivered naturally and surprise surprise it was not for some comic effect as I have come to expect in a typical Hollywood movie.

The tunes were catchy - even the opera-based number by the little penguin praising his dad, which nearly brought to my eyes, and the movie ended with a song based on wonderful Janelle Monae's Tightrope.

Talking of diversity - Will and Bill (voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon) are two tiny krills who make a difference in their own way. Their dialogue will be fun for smart grown-up kids.

SPOILER ALERT - Please stop now if you don't want to know the spoiler.

The movie maker added one more piece of diversity - about 2-3 lines between the two krills, which will be caught only by mature kids or grown-ups, indirectly alluded to attraction felt by one of the krills. My guess is that's where haters, the ones writing one star reviews jumped in.

As an adult, for me, it was OK and I don't liked to be preached to by Hollywood about their political agenda but my grandson doesn't see that.

As far as writing and character development goes, this movie lacked it most every department... the songs were pretty cheesey, the characters were cheesey, and the story was a little (dare I say it) cheesey.

I felt they focused a bit too much on singing, not enough on story. Musicals are fine in my book, but at times it felt like Kidz Bop with penguins. That, and the ending left a bit to be desired.

Happy Feet Two? Pleasantly surprised. The film was well executed, integrating a fantastic mix of humor, family and a lil' dash of drama within a pleasant black and white wrapper. Especially given that this movie, unlike the first, really didn't force a message on you with its ending.",1332720000,2,618,4.282051282051282
4356793,4,B004EPZ0AM,"Before I write my review, I should point out the the reason this movie has such a disproportionate number of 1-star reviews is because blogger Mike Mozart orchestrated a protest in support of killing the overreaching SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act) bills that were introduced by Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), respectively in 2011. Not sure anyone seeing those reviews will connect the dots and realize that all those 1-star reviews have nothing to do with Happy Feet 2, and it's a shame this movie was targeted. Glad SOPA and PIPA were killed, but the collateral damage done to this movie was a real shame.

Is it a 5-star movie? No, but it's a 4-star movie for sure. Just the comedy bits with Bill the Krill and Will the Krill are worth it - they have the absolute best lines in the movie. (Example: when Bill and Will leave the ""swarm,"" Bill cries, ""Goodbye, Krill world!"")

If you liked the first Happy Feet movie, you'll like this one almost as much. (Or, if you felt there was too much of an environmental message in the first one, you might like this sequel better since the preaching is toned down significantly.)

The music is fun and as professionally performed as the first Happy Feet, and the graphics are stunning. There are a few scenes where real people are inserted, just like in the first move, but they're a lot better integrated than the first film. (The sailor who plays the guitar riffs for ""We are the Champions"" is just amazing to watch.)

The 2D Blu-ray is flawless with no discernible flaws in the picture, and the sound is just as good. This disc is about as close to reference as you'll get these days.

However, the 3D Blu-ray has problems...at least on my television, a Sharp 70"" Elite (PRO-70X5FD) which is one of the absolute best 3D TV out today. The amount of crosstalk (ghosting) makes the 3D version unwatchable, IMHO. Perhaps other TVs render the 3D of this disc better, but considering that Avatar, Hubble 3D, Immortals, Hugo, and many other recent 3D Blu-rays look almost flawless on this TV makes me think this 3D disc has an authoring problem. Hopefully other reviewers will chime in to specifically discuss this disc's 3D on their respective TVs to confirm or disprove that this is a problem.

One last note - for those of you who hate that Blu-rays from Amazon.com still come with hard-to-remove stickers on the outer slip cases, this disc is no different. However, because of the more resilient holographic cover on the slip case, the stickers come off a little easier than they would on a matte slip case.",1332547200,12,2613,4.657266811279826

4357044,3,B004EPZ0AM,"This movie has a STELLAR voice cast that kind of fell short.  It reminds me of the disaster movies o the 80's that always had the all-star cast and yet always seemed to fall drastically short.  My daughter who is 3, LOVES penguins and she adored the first movie, but this one wouldn't hold her attention for more than 5 minutes the whole way through.  I wasn't altogether impressed with it myself, but to be fair, I wasn't altogether impressed with the first one either.  I will say this however: The human animation was really good, especially when they are on the deck playing the guitar to Lovelace.  As a matter of fact, I really had no problem with any of the animation.
I was mildly annoyed at the fact that Mumble is still sporting his half baby fluff, even though he is a father now.  That is both lame and in very poor taste because the message is either that he has Peter Pan syndrome and is refusing to grow up, or that he is still an adolescent that is now a parent... neither of which is a message I like for kids.
I'm also not thrilled with the deception of the Puffin and there being no consequences for the lying and manipulation other than his self-imposed momentary isolation.
Then the elephant seal, who goes from being an honorable and loving father to one who seems as treacherous as the sea lion.  Moodiness and crankiness is one thing, but that was a complete personality shift.
The only really fun thing was the journey of self-discovery by the krill... and the possibly gay overtones therein were mildly amusing.
The talent involved in this deserved a well-written script and not this one.  It felt a little like a last-minute paper, written by a frat boy after a beer bust.",1331856000,,1699,4.4935064935064934

4357214,1,B004EPZ0AM,"Back in 2006, WB had a hit with Happy Feet, an animated film about an emperor penguin named Mumble who couldn't sing worth a lick, but who could tap dance his tail off. Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik, who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven, a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son's respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was worth  watching and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, I wasn't too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, its is narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation is expectedly top notch. It's not terrible, but it won't be taking home any awards either.",1331596800,,896,4.4969325153374236

Worst of all they continue with the racist depictions of the penguins! They have these smaller sized penguins who speak with Hispanic/Mexican accents, and, SURPRISE, all they care about is females.

That is because that account was created for the SOLE reason of marking down Happy Feet Two. Why? Because of a very vague environmental message you really have to search for to even see. They're doing the same thing to The Lorax right now and that type of behavior is really dispicable.

Rest assured, Happy Feet Two is a great kid's movie. It's at least as good as the first one with Matt Damon and Brad Pitt adding a whole new dimension to the story and causing me to laugh out loud several times.

Like most cartoons lately it got a sequel (weather they need one or not). This one once again falls into the same category as the rest of the latest cartoon sequels. They try to add a more grown up story and focus less on what made the first one so fun to watch. This is a good movie for kids but there is something missing to make it as good as the first one. I do have to say that the Krill played by Brad Pitt & Matt Damon far and away stole the movie and was the only part I really enjoyed.

If you are looking for a film that introduces complex and philosophical topics to your children every scene, this is a great film.  My daughter, 11, and I had great discussions that were driven by this film. We talked about topics like ""what makes a good leader"", ""popularity"", ""loneliness"", ""love"", ""feeling lost"", ""being part of the whole"", etc.  Yes, this cartoon is a bit too complex for most children.... but that is what parents are for.

Don't be discouraged by all the bad reviews (i equate the bad reviews to trolling)...adults reviewing a kids movie. It's pretty comical that their personal taste goes into a review for a movie for kids. The movie was somewhat well received by critics from what I read. Adults need to check in their expectations for a movie and realize that it's target audience are probably pre-school to elementary kids, NOT ADULTS!!!!

Most sequels are not as good as the first (unless you're pixar & KungFu Panda 2) but overall it was an enjoyable movie. My daughters love it, they sing along and dance to it. The Krills do seem disconnected from the overall plot (existentialism in a kids movie?!? a bit over the top). Bill and Will are comic relief and could have been an entire separate plot to itself.

BUT, it's a movie for kids. Kids who like fun penguins making stupid jokes and dancing and singing. And every kids I saw in the the theater when I saw this movie.. well, they were laughing and jumping up excitedly and dancing along with those stupid, plotless penguins.

So yes, it's a movie with poor plot, no direction, and, obviously, it was only made because they wanted more money. It's not a bad movie though.

This is basically a cartoon about a dancing penguin.  What is causing all the ANGRY reviews about this movie? Nothing. I think these are FAKE reviews. These are not written as if coming from a parent.  A parent would want to help other parents and tell them in more detail what was wrong with the movie. Almost ALL of the NEGATIVE reviews are strange and hostile in nature. They have such an extreme over-the-top message.

There are several RED flags to prove my statement. Almost ALL of these reviews use words like HATE, SUCK, DON'T BUY, etc. There are just too many copycat reviews.  They actually seem like they were all written by the same person. One review was written that stated they did not like the FIRST Happy Feet. REALLY?  Then WHY would they even be interested in going to see the sequel?  One review said he wished he were deaf and blind. REALLY?  Because of a children's animated movie?

Stop force-feeding us computer animated movies (unless they're Pixar) and start making some decent animated movies instead. I put in The Secret of Nimh instead and my kid was glued to the TV.

The story of a penguin, dropped at birth, miraculously survives but becomes a dancer instead of a singer, hereby betraying his heritage.  Yet after a lengthy journey, he helps unite everybody by song and dance and everyone lives happily ever after.  This is Happy Feet 1.

Happy Feet 2 stars Mumble & his son, with his two friends, going on a trip to another land, and finding a PELICAN that other penguins worship.  He tells his story in the end without any lies, and helps save the colony from being crushed to death by the glaciers, without knowing that the undersea creatures are helping out as well.

This was NOT a proper sequel.  It had little to no dancing in it, and it was more singing and problem solving than anything else.

Sure, the youth of today have a bad education, but WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH would you spend $15-20 on a single ticket for a movie that you can only see once, for help with problem solving and vocalization?  Why can't they teach that in schools?!

But the only good thing about this movie is the animation for all the penguins and other creatures to move naturally, like they would in real life.  Two stars for that alone.  Not worth buying, not worth seeing.",1328140800,5,1249,4.477876106194691

4363040,4,B004EPZ0AM,"Having seen Happy Feet 2, I can save you a lot of time in summing it up.  It's not a good children's film if you've got parent issues.  That does not make it a bad movie.

A lot of folks here have trashed it because it opens up kids to the fact that the world is not a safe and wholesome place.  There are people in it who are too selfish, too afraid or too busy to care, even if the debts they owe others are enormous.  There are people in the world we esteem who are not always what we believe them to be.  These are not nice things for kids to learn.

Hence the PG rating.  You will have to explain some of it to the kids.  If you don't like telling your kid about some of the world's realities, don't take them to this movie.

That said, it has an excellent message: That when people put aside their differences, don't let others interfere and work together, they can move mountains.  In this case, literally.

That is a good thing for kids to learn.

The music is on par with the previous movie, with many memorable tracks.  The characters are pretty much the same, with the notable exception of the Krills, Will and Bill.  The message of their journey echoes that of the movie: That although one can be a catalyst for action, it takes the cooperation of many to act in a big way.

If you're looking for mindless fluff your kids can giggle at, keep looking.  If you're looking for a good way to start talking to your kids about what the world is like, this may be a good entree into that conversation.  If you're unsure, watch it with an open mind and without your kids.  Then decide.

I enjoyed it more than average.",1325462400,4,1622,4.1877022653721685
4363041,5,B004EPZ0AM,this movie is awesome. i thought that this movie was just as good as the first movie. happy feet two had more of a storyline that the first but i thought that they both are really good. in all honesty if they make another movie they probably ruin it. so i hope they don't. but if they do i will see it anyways. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.,1325116800,10,367,3.9066666666666667
4363042,3,B004EPZ0AM,"MOVIE NOTE #16: HAPPY FEET TWO
Directed and Co-Written by George Miller (`Mad Max films) - who also did the first Happy Feet film - this film takes a more philosophical approach top storytelling. Mumbles (Voiced by Elijah Wood of `Lord of the Rings') is back - all grown up and now a father of the adorable Erik (voiced by the talented newcomer Ava Acres) and because of a natural iceberg `disaster' the entire Empire Penguins are cut off from their food supply.  Erik and Mumbles are separate from their mother (Mumbles wife), Gloria (Voiced by the pop star Pink) and the rest of the flock.

Strangely enough, the dancing plays a very keen role in the solving of the movies major issue, but I got the impression that Millers intent was to give lessons of courage, self-confidence, perseverance and faith in the ability of oneself - with in the plot of two story lines. One story being a family trying to get back together and the other story is between two independent Krills (tiny shrimp-like creatures) learning that they don't necessarily have to leave home to be an individual.

Will the Krill (Voiced by Brad Pitt of `Benjamin Buttons') and Bill the Krill (Voiced by Matt Damon of the `Borne' films) have a hysterical romp and exploration of the world outside of the swarm. Learning that you still can be individual amongst your home, family and friends.  Also back for the film is the ever love crazed Ramon and the team leader of the Empires neighboring penguins Lovelace (both wildly preformed by Robin Williams od ""Mrs Doubtfire', `Aladdin'). Also we are introduced to  a new `penguin' the Mighty Sven (Voiced by the amazing voice of Hank Azaria of `The Birdcage', `The Simpsons', `The Smurfs') who has a really big secret!  And back again is the leader of the Empire Penguins Noah the Elder (Hugo Weaving of `The Matrix', `Lord of the Rings') who guides the entire population of penguins to trust Mumbles and his plans to save the entire emprire!

The music is amazing just like the first film and contains a couple over really well done remakes of Queen's `Under Pressure' and `We are the Champions' - but the story doesn't hold my interests as much as it's predecessor did. Little Erik however is amazingly cute and sentimental and has this vocal Lament that he sings for his father that turns the `bad' sea walruses around and `save the day'. The choreography is impressive for animated mammals and birds....and the arctic snow and soundtrack are impressive too!

I don't know if kids would get the story, but they certainly would get all the sight gags, ice sliding, deep sea fishing and amazing 3-D color effects that make the movie at least visually interesting for everyone watch. Not to mention the toe tapping music. Not quite like (or as good as) the first film, but something for the family if have already seen `The Muppets', `Arthur Christmas' or `Hugo' - in that order- first!",1324252800,7,2901,4.7306930693069305
