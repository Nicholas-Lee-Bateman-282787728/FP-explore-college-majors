5087083,5,B007HPMODM,"I am a huge Amazing Race fan, along with my family, so you can imagine my joy when I discovered that earlier seasons had been released on Amazon.  I bought 2-6 in one big shopping cart and haven't looked back.  Season Five is absolutely stunning when taking into account a couple of different factors:

1) the all-star cast (Colin and Christie/Mirna and Charla to name two)
2) the variability in tasks and locations
3) the ensuing drama
4) the nail-biting final episodes

The entire season was fraught with drama and interesting tactics used by teams.  One tactic I was generally surprised with was when a final three team decided to call ahead for a fast taxi at the airport and shipped home miscellaneous items so that it wouldn't hinder their performance.

Season Five features the love-'em-or-hate-'em team Colin and Christie.  Always in ultra-competitive mode and known for their frequent outbursts of anger, the duo soared through the competition and never looked back. Some of the other reviews have mentioned classic moments featuring Colin, such as his moment with the ox, ""I'm packin' it!"", and a clash a with an unruly cab driver.  Probably my favorite moment was when a team drove by another and shouted an obscenity from the window.

All in all, this season was very memorable and highlights the show's humble beginnings as it's fun to see the vast differences in gameplay from then to now.  One qualm I have about the finale was the lack of a difficult task to complete in order to get to the finish line -- it wasn't terrible but it was lackluster to say the least.

I for one support more releases of this fantastic show on DVD and hope that Amazon sees the light of seasons 8-12.",1337126400,3,1696,4.695945945945946
5087084,5,B007HPMODM,"I like the fact that I could order seasons 5 & 6 before their release date was announce and like a week before the release is coming up they e-mail you the fact that you will get it on this day. (By the way, I actually received it a day before the date scheduled so that made me even happier.) I'm not disappointed with the quality or even the chaptering of the episode- I also like the fact that you can play all episodes on the disc at once. I just wish they had some kind of extras. ""Early Show"" interviews with the winners at least. And one BIG question, Why are Charla and Mirna on the cover of the DVD. In seasons 1-4,6 & 7 all have the top 4 finishers on the cover. C & M finished 6th or 7th. Brandon & Nicole should have been on the cover. Yes the ladies were the breakout stars of the season (and finished 3rd in the all-star season) but the didn't deserve this cover. Still a great buy. Please, please, please release the 8th season (Family Edition) on DVD next.",1335571200,2,972,4.121052631578947
5087085,5,B007HPMODM,Received Season's 5 and 6 a couple of days ago.  Season 5 is my favorite of them all.  Have been watching the show's non stop on my day's off - cannot turn them off - too much fun.  As someone who works in the Travel Industry I find the Amazing Race shows a great learning tool.  The food road blocks are very funny and amazing - how can anyone like Charla eat all she does on her small frame.,1335398400,,393,3.9367088607594938
5087086,5,B007HPMODM,"While I contend that TAR 1, the classic season is still the best, season five is the one that saved the franchise.  While there are an assortment of forgettable racers, Colin and Christie remain the stars of the show whether you love them or hate them.  Christie with her uber-manic intensity (with which she encourages a jeepney driver to run people down) and Colin with his cries of, ""My ox is broken!"" and ""I'm packin' it!"".  I'm delighted that this season will soon be available on DVD because it's the main reason we are now enjoying season 20.  Colin, for that, I thank you.",1332633600,9,580,4.548076923076923
5087087,5,B007HPMODM,"I know that many of you hate them, but I'll argue all day long that Colin and Christie saved the Amazing Race in Season 5.

It literally took 10 races before a couples team (Megan and Shane) tied their combined record of 9 combined 1st/2nd placements; and Megan and Shane did it with pre-arranged flights and a whole lot of bunching to put them up one win (7/2).  The fact that Mirna so clearly hated Colin (he's a criminal!) endeared him to at least half the audience, and the fact that both C&C were intent at every moment on beating every other team, made this race feel like an actual competition.

The animosity that built up between Colin and the other competitors after he and Christie came from the middle of the pack to going 1st or second in the next 8 legs?  That saved the race. Because people either loved Colin because he got that this was a RACE!!!! (which I admit, I did; Colin is my favorite racer ever) or they hated him because he didn't much care what he did to other teams, as long as it put him ahead of them.  And they got their friends to watch, by the dozen that summer; and they saved The Amazing Race.

And then...came the Ox.

Many people have melted down. Many people have had killer fatigue overwhelm them. Many people have said memorable things.

Nobody but Colin has claimed his animal was broken.

I love him, and I love this race. The biggest thanks EVER to Amazon for this season.",1332115200,13,1415,4.370229007633588
5087088,5,B007HPMODM,"Truly the best season, so many memorable moments! Will order immediately when it is released. Must be the most exiciting finale next to the Season 2 foot race.",1331683200,7,159,4.714285714285714
5087089,5,B007HPMODM,"TAR5 remains one of the best seasons of The Amazing Race ever. In fact it's my personal favourite. A great cast, an amazing route and plenty of stand out moments. I've been waiting for this season to come out for years and to finally have it being released is a good day for TAR fans. Amazon Createspace is genius! Keep the TAR DVD's coming! ...and the Survivor ones as well!",1331424000,5,375,4.371428571428571
5087100,5,B007HPMODM,its been a while since ive actually watched the season but i had 2 minor glitches near the end of the race. it wasn't really anything special i only missed a team get the yield. and another when phil was talking. its still a 5 star rating because its not like the whole thing glitched and its not like i missed anyone not get checked in or missed the roadblocks and detours. it was a good race. and yea.....,1376784000,,407,4.1645569620253164

5087102,5,B007HPMODM,"As above, I like all the Amazing Race shows: the contestants challenges, problems, ways to cope with seemingly impossible situations in strange lands. Sort of a travelogue with some drama added.",1366329600,,194,5.290322580645161
5087103,5,B007HPMODM,"Have watched this whole series and its a wonderful way to see travel places we probably will never be able to go to.  Very well done, love it.",1359331200,,142,4.071428571428571
5087104,5,B007HPMODM,"Love the show!  Please get the remaining seasons as soon as possible, I anxiously await them to add to my collection!",1357516800,,117,4.571428571428571
5087105,5,B007HPMODM,This season of amazing race is one of my favorites. Highly recommend this product. I enjoyed watching it for the second time.,1357084800,,125,4.7272727272727275
5087106,5,B007HPMODM,"Season 5 still stands as one of the very best seasons of TAR ever.  An excellent cast, great destinations and some of the most memorable tasks and challenges ever, TAR5 is a must have set.",1356825600,,188,4.371428571428571
5087107,5,B007HPMODM,"This was the very first season I ever watched of ""The Amazing Race"" and I was hooked from the start!

It is a very exciting season, but the thing I like most is that the cast is made up of people who seem like REAL, ordinary people you would meet every day. In recent years I have stopped watching the show, because it seems like now they only cast people who look like professional models.

This was the very best season, with the most likable and relatable cast the show ever had. (The bowling Moms are still my favorite team EVER!)",1354838400,2,534,4.2772277227722775
5087108,5,B007HPMODM,"Season 5 was another great Season for The Amazing Race. Only one complaint....whomever is making these DVD's for Amazon has terrible quality control. I've been purchasing each season, and plan to get them all; but they always arrive a bit scuffed; I only had 1 season scuffed so badly it didn't play correctly, and Amazon was great on the refund; but there's nothing worse than getting halfway through a season, only to find a spot where it freezes-up due to scuffing. I don't know if it's a human- handling or a machine-burning problem, but it should be easily rectified with a bit better quality control.",1350086400,,606,4.780952380952381
5087109,5,B007HPMODM,"I've seen every episode of this series and think this is one of the rare reality shows with true value.

The thing I love most about the show are the locations.  It is the next best thing to traveling the world myself.  Not only do I get to see multiple and varied locales, including many that I will likely never get to travel to myself, but the show producers also do a great job of finding the most unique adventures to complete in each area.  I've learned more about world geography and different cultures than I ever learned in any classroom.

It's also interesting to watch the interpersonal dynamics between teammates and between teams.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding the conflicts entertaining . . . and the stress of travel and competition does bring it out.  But I always root for the teams that are nicest to each other.

And it's rewarding to see how the intensity of the race truly brings teammates closer together by forcing them to work together and rely on one another.",1340755200,,997,4.5
8516802,4,B007HPMODM,"Other than NOT being in widescreen, I love the show and liked the DVDs.",1493596800,,71,4.142857142857143
8516803,4,B007HPMODM,"I started watching the Amazing Race the season immediately after this one and I've now got my wife hooked on it too. When the most current season ended this spring we didn't want to wait till fall for more Amazing race so we got this DVD to enjoy over the summer. We intended to watch one episode a week, as if it were being broadcast as a regular season. After all, at $30+ a season these things aren't cheap! Of course we didn't do that, we watched at least two episodes a week, sometimes more, and burning through the season in no time...so I just ordered another one.

Having never watched the earlier seasons I noticed some differences as compared to the current version of the show. A couple of them I think made the game better, like not forcing the teams to beg for money when they come in last on a non-elimination leg, it just looks seedy, and not allowing outside help to complete challenges, but most of all I like that now they have to alternate challenges, so that one team member can't do all the challenges (or most of them) as happened in this episode with a few teams. I also noticed that the pacing in this season was a bit more frenetic than it is in current seasons, they've slowed things down a bit and spent more time on the challenges which I think is great.

But overall it was pure Amazing Race, we loved some of the teams and hated some of them and some but in this episode we were happy with who won (and who didn't). As opposed to season 6 which I haven't seen since it's original airing but still remember because of the horrible couple who won. But that's part of the fun of this show, the nice guys don't always finish first although it seems more often than not they do. And it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through.

So if you're an Amazing Race fan like we are and it seems to you like a very long time until the next season starts I'd highly recommend getting sets of past seasons and watching them. Just don't go on line to find info on the teams until you've watched the whole season because it's too easy to stumble across the names of the winners and while that doesn't totally kill the thrill, it's still kind of a kill joy.",1468368000,,2182,4.240384615384615

8516805,5,B007HPMODM,Awesome show..sometimes the contestants are a little hostile towards each other but that's the price to pay for trying to win a billion bucks!,1463702400,,142,4.958333333333333

8516811,5,B007HPMODM,I am a late starter to the Amazing Race but now I am hooked. One of the best reality shows there are . I love the travel and culture seeing areas of the world that I may not otherwise. I also enjoy the strategy how one decision on A flight can cost or win someone $1 million. I do hope Amazon drops the price back to. $16.99 again on the older ones $31 is pricey,1387756800,,362,3.84
