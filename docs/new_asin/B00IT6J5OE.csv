8645220,5,B00IT6J5OE,"Thrills a minute! A riveting, grimy, and true to life epic that highlights the dark and ugly side of sex slave trafficking and the web that envelops all who encounter it.

A fearless heroine who plays by her own rules and breaks them when necessary, this unheralded action flick has everything you could want in a major blockbuster with a splash of indie ingenuity and genuine moments of humor and adventure.

Watching this movie will leave you reaffirmed in a faith in humanity you might not have known you had. Watch it today!",1447200000,,528,4.666666666666667
