8583014,5,B00CLBSVP2,"This review is for the movie not the DVD. I have a copy from another collector that is Region one. Being a Peter Cushing fan I am always looking
for any Movie or TV shows with him and a fan of Nazi film noir mysteries as well. This is a well made good thriller. The first time I watched it I
wasn't that impressed with it but it was good and even better 2nd and 3rd etc...The problem is the main character played by Stanley Baker who
just never seems likeable in this role as he plays it without any real emotion other than anger and it just comes off fake and just bad. Peter
Cushing plays a doctor who is involved in this plot to cover up a secret along with the local Police and others. The story eventually gets to
the truth and the ending is very good and Cushing actually is kind of a hero in the movie not the villain he's made out to be. If your a fan of
Cushing and good classic mystery movies this is a good one and worth a look. You can find copies that play on US DVD players online.",1452124800,,995,3.98
