This is dedicated to the Vigilantes who helped to tame the west. They were a popular organization who restored law and order as needed when the law couldn't act. It begins with men driving a herd of cattle west. Some are in wagons. Other men plan to rob them before they start across the desert. There is shooting, the settlers are driven off. Their Hereford cattle are rounded up. A young boy is kidnapped by the robbers. His brother survived. Years pass. Gold strikes attract men to California. It also attracts robbers and thieves, so people are leaving. John Wyatt asks for help from the state, money for men and guns to fight the outlaws. He gathers volunteers for a meeting. They must band together. Black shirts and a white scarf are worn for identification. A song for entertainment.

They begin to attack outlaw gangs such as the ones who robbed the Express Office and killed a man. John joins a herd as Trail Boss. An outlaw gang plans to steal the Gordon herd. They find a lone man, his horse was stolen. He advised Gordon against John Allen, and to move out at night. When the outlaws attack the Vigilantes drive them off. John rescues a runaway wagon to save Miss Gordon. One outlaw speaks to save his life. The outlaws plan to rob a bank of $60,000 in gold. John visits town to ask about Ballard. One man warns Ballard, they try to stop John Wyatt. Jim decoys Miss Gordon to capture her, he has a plan. John reaches the Vigilantes and they ride to town. Jim passes a false message to John. The outlaws rob the bank and get away. The townsmen are up in arms. Jim hears the truth from Miss Gordon. Can he ride to warn John about the ambush in time?

There is shooting, the ambushers are discovered. Miss Gordon rides to get the Vigilantes and direct them to Blind Canyon. John and Jim ride away. They chase Ballard, who is in a wagon. John rides up, there is a fight. The wagon upsets, John survives, but Jim is wounded. Everythings square. There is a final song, the band will be disbanded. John will return to his ranch in California. Will Mary join him for a happy ending. [Did they have hers of Herefords or longhorns at that point of time?] That large group of Vigilantes and outlaws seems quite exaggerated to me; food and lodging? Vigilante is Spanish for watchman, those who guarded a community. It was composed of volunteers, like the militia, who assembled to serve the needs of the community. The posse in those old westerns is the equivalent of a militia.

In 1851 San Francisco the merchants formed a Committee of Vigilance to combat the robbers and thieves when the Sheriff did little. This is an average movie similar to the dramas shown on TV today. The plot of long-lost brothers who are re-united was used in other movies where one was a good guy and one was a bad guy. The effects of environment rather than genetics? In time the Vigilantes or Regulators became the hired guns of the big ranchers or cattle barons. The Johnson County War in 1893 Wyoming inspired many Western movies, where the cattle baron tried to drive out the small ranchers and homesteaders to grab their lands or water rights.",1429488000,,3170,4.517421602787456
