Chilling but inspiring memoir.

Here is an interesting story soon to be made into a movie.

A Girl With An Apple

(This is a true story and you can find out more by Googling Herman Rosenblat. He was Bar Mitzvahed at age 75)

August 1942. Piotrkow , Poland .

The sky was gloomy that morning as we waited anxiously.
All the men, women and children of Piotrkow's Jewish ghetto
had been herded into a square.

Word had gotten around that we were being moved. My father
had only recently died from typhus, which had run rampant
through the crowded ghetto. My greatest fear was that our
family would be separated.

'Whatever you do,' Isidore, my eldest brother, whispered to me,
'don't tell them your age. Say you're sixteen.

'I was tall for a boy of 11, so I could pull it off. That way I might
be deemed valuable as a worker.

An SS man approached me, boots clicking against the cobblestones.
He looked me up and down, and then asked my age.

'Sixteen,' I said. He directed me to the left, where my three brothers
and other healthy young men already stood.

My mother was motioned to the right with the other women, children,
sick and elderly people.

I whispered to Isidore, 'Why?'

He didn't answer.

I ran to Mama's side and said I wanted to stay with her.

'No, 'she said sternly.

'Get away. Don't be a nuisance. Go with your brothers.'

She had never spoken so harshly before. But I understood:
She was protecting me. She loved me so much that, just this once,
she pretended not to. It was the last I ever saw of her.

My brothers and I were transported in a cattle car to Germany ..

We arrived at the Buchenwald concentration camp one night later
and were led into a crowded barrack. The next day, we were issued
uniforms and identification numbers.

'Don't call me Herman anymore.' I said to my brothers. 'Call me 94983.'

I was put to work in the camp's crematorium, loading the dead
into a hand-cranked elevator.

I, too, felt dead. Hardened, I had become a number.

Soon, my brothers and I were sent to Schlieben, one of Buchenwald 's
sub-camps near Berlin ..

One morning I thought I heard my mother's voice.

'Son,' she said softly but clearly, I am going to send you an angel.'

Then I woke up. Just a dream. A beautiful dream.

But in this place there could be no angels. There was only work.
And hunger. And fear.

A couple of days later, I was walking around the camp, around the
barracks, near the barbed-wire fence where the guards could not
easily see. I was alone.

On the other side of the fence, I spotted someone: a little girl with light,
almost luminous curls. She was half-hidden behind a birch tree.

I glanced around to make sure no one saw me. I called to her softly in
German. 'Do you have something to eat?'

She didn't understand.

I inched closer to the fence and repeated the question in Polish.
She stepped forward. I was thin and gaunt, with rags wrapped around
my feet, but the girl looked unafraid. In her eyes, I saw life.

She pulled an apple from her woolen jacket and threw it over the fence.

I grabbed the fruit and, as I started to run away, I heard her say faintly,
'I'll see you tomorrow.'

I returned to the same spot by the fence at the same time every day.
She was always there with something for me to eat - a hunk of bread or,
better yet, an apple.

We didn't dare speak or linger. To be caught would mean death
for us both.

I didn't know anything about her, just a kind farm girl, except that she
understood Polish. What was her name?
Why was she risking her life for me?

Hope was in such short supply, and this girl on the other side of the fence
gave me some, as nourishing in its way as the bread and apples.

Nearly seven months later, my brothers and I were crammed into a
coal car and shipped to Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia .

'Don't return,' I told the girl that day. 'We're leaving.'

I turned toward the barracks and didn't look back, didn't even say
good-bye to the little girl whose name I'd never learned,
the girl with the apples.

We were in Theresienstadt for three months. The war was winding down
and Allied forces were closing in, yet my fate seemed sealed.

On May 10, 1945, I was scheduled to die in the gas chamber at 10:00 AM.

In the quiet of dawn, I tried to prepare myself. So many times death
seemed ready to claim me, but somehow I'd survived. Now, it was over.

I thought of my parents. At least, I thought, we will be reunited.

But at 8 A .M. there was a commotion. I heard shouts, and saw people
running every which way through camp. I caught up with my brothers.

Russian troops had liberated the camp! The gates swung open.
Everyone was running, so I did too. Amazingly, all of my brothers
had survived;

I'm not sure how. But I knew that the girl with the apples had been the
key to my survival.

In a place where evil seemed triumphant, one person's goodness had
saved my life, had given me hope in a place where there was none.

My mother had promised to send me an angel, and the angel had come.

Eventually I made my way to England where I was sponsored by a
Jewish charity, put up in a hostel with other boys who had survived
the Holocaust and trained in electronics. Then I came to America ,
where my brother Sam had already moved. I served in the U. S. Army
during the Korean War, and returned to New York City after two years.

By August 1957 I'd opened my own electronics repair shop.
I was starting to settle in.

One day, my friend Sid who I knew from England called me.

'I've got a date. She's got a Polish friend. Let's double date.'

A blind date? Nah, that wasn't for me.

But Sid kept pestering me, and a few days later we headed up to the
Bronx to pick up his date and her friend Roma.

I had to admit, for a blind date this wasn't so bad. Roma was a nurse
at a Bronx hospital. She was kind and smart. Beautiful, too,
with swirling brown curls and green, almond-shaped eyes that
sparkled with life.

The four of us drove out to Coney Island . Roma was easy to talk to,
easy to be with.

Turned out she was wary of blind dates too!

We were both just doing our friends a favor. We took a stroll on the
boardwalk, enjoying the salty Atlantic breeze, and then had dinner by
the shore. I couldn't remember having a better time.

We piled back into Sid's car, Roma and I sharing the backseat.

As European Jews who had survived the war, we were aware that much
had been left unsaid between us. She broached the subject,
'Where were you,' she asked softly, 'during the war?'

'The camps,' I said. The terrible memories still vivid, the irreparable loss..
I had tried to forget. But you can never forget.

She nodded. 'My family was hiding on a farm in Germany ,
not far from Berlin ,' she told me. 'My father knew a priest,
and he got us Aryan papers.'

I imagined how she must have suffered too, fear, a constant companion.
And yet here we were both survivors, in a new world.

'There was a camp next to the farm.' Roma continued. 'I saw a boy there
and I would throw him apples every day.'

What an amazing coincidence that she had helped some other boy.
'What did he look like? I asked.

'He was tall, skinny, and hungry. I must have seen him every day
for six months.'

My heart was racing. I couldn't believe it.

This couldn't be.

'Did he tell you one day not to come back because he was leaving Schlieben?'

Roma looked at me in amazement. 'Yes!'

'That was me!'

I was ready to burst with joy and awe, flooded with emotions.
I couldn't believe it! My angel.

'I'm not letting you go.' I said to Roma. And in the back of the car
on that blind date, I proposed to her. I didn't want to wait.

'You're crazy!' she said. But she invited me to meet her parents for
Shabbat dinner the following week.

There was so much I looked forward to learning about Roma,
but the most important things I always knew: her steadfastness,
her goodness. For many months, in the worst of circumstances,
she had come to the fence and given me hope. Now that I'd found
her again, I could never let her go.

That day, she said yes. And I kept my word. After nearly 50 years
of marriage, two children and three grandchildren, I have never let her go.

8435529,4,B004M5HHPA,"One of a few documentaries I've viewed over the years with a noticeably left leaning bias that taints the message. As usual, the out of touch, greedy conservatives have performed a callous deed. They put up a fence in a haphazard way without listening to the community, and now more illegal immigrants are dying while attempting to get into America.

Immigration is way to important an issue to polarize people buy blaming one political group or another. Sure, republicans are greedy. But a while back we had a rather liberal President named Bill Clinton, who hired a democrat named Barbara Jordon, to head the 'Commission on Immigration Reform'. Jordon came out of that stating we absolutely needed to reform the immigration system in this country. Nothing much happened though.

So don't be fooled. It's not the republicans. It's not the democrats. It's government. In this case it spent 3 billion dollars to erect a border fence. The documentary illustrates clearly that the fence doesn't work. The immigrants still come through in similar numbers. 3 billion down the drain and a disruption to wildlife, businesses, and people. Plus 25 billion more over the next few decades to maintain the fence.

Although the somewhat sarcastic narration by Rory Kennedy lowers the credibility of the film, the interviews of 'boots on the ground' locals, many of whom are part of an organized militia to protect their property rights, et al, and come off sounding sincere, rational, and capable, that restores faith in the documentary. These folks are doing their best and seem to be remaining compassionate despite years of being encroached upon.

But again, the real story is the fantastic amount of money being used to build and maintain a fence that doesn't work. No one seems to be coming in to fine tune the project to hopefully improve its effectiveness. The real point I'd like to make here however goes beyond the topic of a border fence. I recently watched a documentary on Amazon Prime called 'The Pentagon Wars', which depicts the multi-decade, multi-billion dollar boondoggle of the development of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. A travesty which continues to this day. We STILL haven't figured out how to make government spending anywhere near cost effective.

Is it even possible to spend wisely? Consider the border fence. The fence was rushed, but it got built. The result is a partial fence with many holes and leaks. It doesn't do the job. On the other end though, if the time had been taken to plan the fence properly, if meetings had been held with local communities, if a consensus had been allowed to develop before starting construction... the project may still be waiting to start construction.

Furthermore, injecting private enterprise into the mix doesn't address the core issue. The fence was built by private contractors. A local interviewed in the documentary claims the welders were paid $800 day. Hello!? And have you ever seen a documentary about private prisons? Ahhh!

It's when government writes a check... that things start to go down hill. The all important 'incentive' that motivates humans to be smart and efficient is removed when someone else is picking up the tab. It's only natural. There are nearly 150 million people on food stamps in the US. The only way that number is planned to be reduced is by the coming rules modifications that will limit families to three months of benefits Most won't deist on their own even though employment rolls are filling..

Unfortunately, even when government turns the whole kit and caboodle over to the private sector things don't work as they should. The NSA spends 70% of its budget on outside contractors. Certainly these private firms are more efficient, right? Wrong. The contractors are not subject to the same 4th amendment restrictions as is the NSA. So instead of saving money the NSA is contributing to America becoming a spy state. Our local National Forrest campgrounds are now run not by uniformed park personnel but rather by concessionaires, who take in a massive flow of cash from the public, pass little of the income back to the government, funnel as little of the cash as possible back into the infrastructure of the park, hire barely employable camp hosts, and put the rest in their well-lined pockets. It's really had to get the balance just right.

With the border fence it seems the only solution is to remove the incentive that makes people want to emigrate from their native country, including the countries south of Mexico whose migrants pass through.

But big picture, we, humanity, need to continue to lift ourselves out of the greed trap. If we can evolve to a point where people en mass start putting the needs of their fellow human above their own needs, to stop viewing the pie as too small, most of the problems of humanity would evaporate. Not only would we not need to spend billions on crap projects, we wouldn't need the thousands of laws that are on the books to force people to behave well. People would just naturally behave in a more high-minded fashion.

So adopt a creed. Pick up any religious text and there is an emphasis on putting others first. It's the one commonality among all beliefs. Heck, if we all adopted the Boy Scout creed we'd be light years ahead. Think about it. A Scout is:

Trustworthy,
Loyal,
Helpful,
Friendly,
Courteous,
Kind,
Obedient,
Cheerful,
Thrifty,
Brave,
Clean,
and Reverent.
